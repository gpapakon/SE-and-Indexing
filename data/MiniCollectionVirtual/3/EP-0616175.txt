<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to an environment decontaminating system 
having air cleaning and deodorizing functions. It is object of 

the invention to provide such a system to reproduce cleaned air 
which should be provided by the nature covered with rich green 

by artificially utilizing dust collection, air sterilization, 
forest bathing effect, deodorizing and acid gas adsorption with 

safety as well as stability and thereby to maintain a desired 
indoor air quality. This object is achieved by a system having a 

DC high voltage dust collector, a dust catching filter, an ozone 
generator, an odor/ozone turbulent mixing plate, a deodorizing 

catalyst, an acid gas absorbent, a suction scavenging fan and an 
ozone concentration sensor arranged in this order, wherein said 

ozone concentration sensor is placed at an outlet of cleaned 
air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an environment 
decontaminating system having air cleaning and deodorizing 
functions used to eliminate air pullution generated within 
housing facilities of human society utilizing functions 
such as dust collection, deodorization, acid gas adsorption 
and air sterilization. More specifically, the invention relates to such 
environment decontaminating system used for various indoor 
environments hedged off from outside air in office 
building, domestic room, restaurant, teahouse, vehicle, 
ship, clubhouse, karaoke-house, barber shop, beauty salon, 
sickroom and cookroom to achieve desired functions such as 
dust collection, deodorization, air sterilization and acid 
gas adsorption and thereby to realize artificially air 
decontaminating effect as well as forest bathing effect 
both of which should be naturally provided under the effect 
of negative ions. There have already been proposed various techniques 
for cleaning of indoor air, for example, the technique (1) 
in which a dust collecting function by AC or DC boosting is 
combined with a filter and absorbent such as activated 
charcoal or physical absorbent to achieve adsorption of 
offensive odor; the technique (2) in which cigarette smoke 
or the like is caught by paper filter under Coulomb effect 
provided by DC boosting, on one hand, and a very small 
amount of ozone is generated in order to decompose the 
offensive odor under masking effect of ozone, on the other 
hand; and the technique (3) in which dust collector 
utilizing DC boosting, easily cleanable filter, ozone 
concentration sensor, ozone generator, ozone deodorizing 
catalyst, acid gas absorbent and a scavenging fan are 
serially combined in this order within one and the same 
wind tunnel to achieve a desired air cleaning. (Japanese 
Patent Application No. 1991-289318 and Japanese Utility 
Model Application No. 1992-38674). Further another 
technique is well known which is based on the chemical 
deodorization utilizing a combination of ozone generator, 
deodorizing catalyst and acid gas absorbent (Japanese 
patent application Disclosure No. 1991-143524), but the 
technique based on the chemical deodorization utilizing 
ozone often endangers a safety because this technique fails 
to consider a problem of secular change. Specifically, the above-mentioned technique (1) of  
 
well known art is disadvantageous in that, once the 
activated charcoal or physical absorbent has been saturated 
with offensive odor absorbed therein, this odor is emitted 
again

and deodorizing functions comprising:
 
   a housing having an air inlet and an air outlet, said 

housing enclosing therein: 

a high voltage DC dust collector having the Coulomb 
effect, 
an ozone generator having a dielectric layer formed 
by a fine ceramic, 
an ozone deodorizing catalyst, 
an acid gas absorbent, and 
a suction scavenging fan, 
which are arranged from the air inlet side toward the 
air outlet side, and 
 
an ozone concentration sensor provided adjacent said air 

outlet, the gas phase concentration of ozone emitted by the 
scavenging fan being monitored by said ozone concentration 

sensor, and thereby an ozone output being controlled by means 
of a control unit. 
An environment decontaminating system having air cleaning

concentration of ozone emission is controlled to a level lower 
than 0.06 ppm of the gas emission safety standard.  

 
Environment decontaminating system having air 
cleaning and deodorizing functions according to Claim 1, 

wherein the system is constructed so as to be readily 
responsive to a variation in dust collection load for 

cigarette smoke or the like under high voltage DC Coulomb 
effect of a predetermined boosted voltage and, once 

decontaminated, the number of negative ions in an indoor 
environment is stabilized to the number of negative ions 

usually observed in suburbs covered with rich green. 
Environment decontaminating system having air

wherein the ozone concentration sensor is placed 
immediately behind the outlet of the system and controls 

output of ozone generation in order that an ozone exhaust 
concentration be maintained at a level lower than 0.06 ppm
