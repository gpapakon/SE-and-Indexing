<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an anti-whistling 
duckbill check valve (10) for use in a fluid flow path for 

permitting relatively free flow of fluid in the path in a 
first direction from a first to a second end of the valve 

and for preventing fluid flow in the path in a second 
opposite direction. The check valve includes first and 

second lips (32, 34) extending in converging relationship 
to each other from a base portion (12) of the valve (10). A 

vibration dampening rib (52, 54) is located on each of the 
lips (32, 34) wherein the ribs are configured to have a 

natural frequency substantially equal to that of the lips. 
The ribs (52, 54) vibrate out of phase with the lips such 

that the vibration of the lips is dampened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a duckbill
check valve for use in a flow path for permitting
relatively free flow of fluid in the flow path in a first
direction from a first to a second end of the check valve
and for preventing fluid flow in the path in a second
opposite direction. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a duckbill check valve having a
construction which limits the vibration of lips forming
the valve in order to prevent the production of whistling
sounds during fluid flow through the valve.Duckbill valves are widely used to control
fluid flow in a variety of devices. The structure of
duckbill valves typically includes a pair of substantially
planar lip portions which converge toward each
other from a first to a second end of the valve. The lip
portions are joined at lateral edges thereof by side
walls such that the lip portions and side walls define a
fluid flow path therethrough. The valve is typically
formed of an elastomeric material and the lip portions
are formed as thin highly flexible members which provide
a low resistance to forward flow through the valve while
producing a positive closing force for closing a slit at
the second end of the valve to prevent reverse flow
through the valve.Due to the highly flexible structure of the lip
portions, fluid flow through the valve at certain
pressures and fluid flow rates results in the lip
portions flexing in and out at a high rate to produce a
vibration resulting in a high pitch tone or whistling
noise. This noise is undesirable in many applications of
the valve. For example, duckbill valves are frequently
used to control fluid flow in fluid lines used in medical
environments where it is undesirable to have fluid flow
noise, and this problem is particularly evident when the
valve operates to control flow of a gas therethrough. Patent EP-A-0 452 045 (on which the pre-characterising
part of claim 1 is based) discloses a duckbill valve including
a resilient body having converging lips for permitting fluid
flow through the valve in one direction only. A pair of
elongated projections are provided on diametrically opposed
sides of the valve body. The stated purpose of these
projections is to bias the lips towards a closed configuration
so as to prevent leakage through the valve in a back flow
direction. The patent does not address the problem of the
noise produced when fluid flows through the valve. Accordingly, there is a need for a valve which controls
fluid flow in a desired direction and which does so without
producing

<CLAIMS>
A valve (10) comprising:

   a resilient valve body including a base (12) and a pair
of converging lips (32, 34) supported on the base (12) for

controlling fluid flow;

   characterised in that said valve also comprises vibration
dampeners (52, 54) configured to have a characteristic natural

frequency substantially equal to the natural frequency of said
lips (32, 34) which vibration dampeners (52, 54) are supported

on said lips (32, 34) of said valve body for dampening a
vibrating movement of said valve body during fluid flow past

said valve.
The valve according to claim 1 wherein said vibration
dampeners (52, 54) are caused to vibrate in response to fluid

flow through said valve.
The valve according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
vibration dampeners (52, 54) vibrate out of phase with the

vibration of said valve body whereby the vibrations of said
valve body are cancelled by the vibrations of said vibration

dampeners (52, 54).
The valve according to claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein said
vibration dampeners (52, 54) are formed as resilient

cantilever members extending in spaced relation to said valve
body.
The valve according to claim 4 wherein said resilient
cantilever members have a natural frequency in accordance with

a mathematical relationship containing M, L and S wherein M is
the mass, S is the bending stiffness of the connection of said

cantilever members with said valve body and L is the length of
said cantilever members. 
The valve according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
vibration dampeners (52, 54) comprise a rib formed on an

exterior surface of each of said lips (32, 34), each said rib
being configured to vibrate at a natural frequency cancelling

vibrations of said lips (32, 34).
The valve according to claim 6 wherein said opposing
lips (32, 34) define a slit (50) therebetween at one end of

said valve and said ribs extend in spaced relation to said
lips toward said one end of said valve.
A method of controlling noise in a valve (10) having
a resilient valve body, comprising the steps of:


supporting a vibration dampener (52, 54) on said valve
body for dampening movement of said valve body; and
causing a fluid to flow past said valve body to create a
vibrating movement in each of said valve body and said

The method according to claim 8 or 9 wherein said
vibration dampener (52, 54) is mounted to move in response to
