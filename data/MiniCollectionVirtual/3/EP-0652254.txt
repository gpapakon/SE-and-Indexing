<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a golf ball which is 
superior in shot feel, control properties, flight 

performance and cut resistance. As the base resin of the 
cover of the golf ball, a heated mixture composed of (A) an 

ionomer resin or a mixture thereof, (B) a terpolymer resin 
of α-olefin, unsaturated carboxylate and unsaturated 

carboxylic acid and (C) a glycidyl group-containing α-olefinic 
copolymer resin is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball. More 
particularly, it relates to a golf ball which is superior 
in shot feel control properties, flight performances and 
cut resistance. Recently, ionomer resins have been widely used as the 
base resin for a cover of a golf ball (e.g. Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 49-27093). Particularly, 
ionomer resins are exclusively used in a two-piece golf ball 
having a solid core. This is because ionomer resins are superior in 
durability, cut resistance and resilience performances, 
and, further, they are easily processed and inexpensive in 
comparison with other base resins for the cover. However, ionomer resins are inferior in shot feel 
and control properties (easiness of applying spin on a 
ball) in comparison with a balata (transpolyisoprene) used 
as the base resin for the cover of the thread wound golf 
ball since ionomer resins have considerably high hardness 
and stiffness.  
 Therefore, an attempt to improve the shot feel 
and control performances by softening ionomer resins 
by various means has been made. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publication Nos. 1-308577 and 5-3913 suggests that a 
high-rigid ionomer resin is softened by blending 
(mixing) a soft ionomer resin, obtained by 
neutralizing a terpolymer of α-olefin, unsaturated 
carboxylic acid (e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 
etc.) and acrylate with sodium or zinc ion, to improve 
the shot feel and control properties. However, even if the soft ionomer resin as 
described above is blended, the shot feel similar to 
that of the golf ball with the balata cover is still 
not obtained. Further, blending of the soft ionomer 
resin is accompanied by deterioration of resilience 
performances and flight performances and, therefore, 
satisfactory results have not been obtained. EP-A-0557069 relates to a golf ball having a 
cover which comprises a heated mixture of an ionomer 
resin and a polymer containing a glycidyl group as a 
main component. As described above, an ionomer resin cover is 
inferior in shot feel and control properties in 
comparison with thread wound golf balls with a balata 
cover as mainly used for thread wound golf balls, 
because ionomer resins have high hardness and 
stiffness. Further, satisfactory results have not 
been obtained in an attempt to improve the shot feel 
and control properties by softening the ionomer resin.  
 Under these circumstances, in order to satisfy 
excellent shot feel and control properties which are 
similar to those of golf balls
