<ABSTRACT>
The truck has a loading platform (19) which comprises an unloading device arranged in the frame, by which goods loaded in the body can be unloaded after opening of a rear wall (17). The unloading device consists of a conveyor belt which closes a bottom outlet (22). The rear wall is formed as an oscillating flap (18) in the area of an upper body edge (11b) rotatable around a swivel axis (23). The swivel axis is connected to an indicator device (25) showing the swivel position of the oscillating flap. The swivel axis on at least one vehicle side emerges directly or indirectly out of the body and, on its outward end, is connected with the indicator device.
