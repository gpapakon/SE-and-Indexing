<ABSTRACT>
A seal for a gas turbine engine comprises a 
plurality of arcuate seal elements 19 extending around a 

turbine stage and which are spaced from each other to 
define inclined inter-segment gaps 33. The segments 

have cooling passages (43) discharging into the gaps 33 
which discharge a film of cooling air, the film being 

discharge so as to enter the working fluid flow path 
with a minimum of momentum exchange between the cooling 

air and the working fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to seals, and in
particular to seals for use in gas turbine engines of the type having an
annular flow path for working fluid. The invention is specifically related
to a seal formed from several seal segments that extend circumferentially
about the engine's longitudinal axis and confine the working fluid to the
flow path of the engine.Axial flow, gas turbine engines typically have a compression
section, a combustion section and a turbine section. An annular flow path
for the working fluid extends axially through the sections. A stator
assembly extends about the annular flow path for confining the working
fluid to the flow path and for directing the fluid along the flow path.As the working fluid flows along the flow path, the working fluid
is pressurized in the compression section and burned with fuel in the
combustion section to add energy to the working fluid. The hot,
pressurized working fluid is expanded through the turbine section to
produce work. A major portion of this work is used for driving a free
turbine or developing thrust for an aircraft.A remaining portion of the work generated by the turbine section
is not used for these purposes. Instead it is used to compress the working
fluid itself. A rotor assembly extends between the turbine section and the
compression section to transfer this work from the turbine section to the
compression section. The rotor assembly in the turbine section has rotor
blades which extend outwardly across the working medium flow path. 
The rotor blades have airfoils which are angled with respect to the
approaching flow to receive work from the working fluid and to drive the
rotor assembly about the axis of rotation.An outer air seal circumscribes the rotor blades to confine the
working fluid to the flow path. Typically, outer air seals are metallic and
may or may not be coated with ceramic thermal barrier materials to
inhibit heat transfer from the working fluid to the seal. The outer air seal
is part of the stator structure and is formed of a plurality of arcuate
segments. The stator assembly further includes an outer case and a
structure for supporting the segments of the outer air seal from the outer
case. The outer case and the support structure position the seal segments
in close proximity to the blades to block the leakage of the working fluid
past the tips of the blades. As a result, the segments are in intimate
contact with the hot working fluid, receive heat from the working fluid
and are cooled to keep the temperature of the
