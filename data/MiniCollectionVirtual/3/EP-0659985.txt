coming from said first zone (21), 
ignition and precipitation in a third zone (23) of said 
carbon particles present in said gas

<DESCRIPTION>
In the combustion of carbonrich substances there is often
abundant emission of carbon dust particles (particulate) due to
lack of air in the mixture to be burnt or even to mixing
defects.In accordance with the present invention the particulate is
precipitated by means of a system consisting of at least one
electrode connected to a pole of a voltage generator while the
other pole is connected to the outer shell of the device.Between the two poles is established a strong difference of
potential. The carbon particles pass between said at least one
electrode and the outer shell of the device and thus cause
discharges between the conductors and the particles which are
brought to incandescence and burnt.The present invention relates to a device for precipitation of
particulate in exhaust gases and more specifically a system of
eliminating or at least reducing considerably the emission of
particulate from diesel engines or from all those applications
in which hydrocarbons are burnt such as diesel fuel or heavier,
even in mixtures with an aromatic fraction such as heating 
plants, portable generators, large power plants, etc., or coal.Even though for the sake of simplicity diesel engines are
referred to hereinafter the remarks set forth and the
conclusions reached refer and apply also to the other applications.From the combustion of hydrocarbons, already starting from
molecules with about ten carbon atoms or simple aromatic
molecules, there are obtained in addition to conventional
combustion products such as CO, C02 and H20 also other products
such as unburned organic compounds, carbon dust and nitrogen
oxides. This also applies, at least as concerns the emission
of carbon dust, to coal combustion.The composition of exhaust gas can vary considerably depending
on the quantity of air employed in combustion. However, for
good process yield, e.g. to achieve sufficient power, the ratio
of air to fuel is fixed around certain values for which it is
difficult to avoid some particulate emission.The phenomenon is particularly visible in diesel engines for
vehicles, which are therefore accused of being highly polluting
and harmful to public health.In principle these accusations are largely unfounded. Indeed,
compared with petrol (gasoline) engines diesels emit from four
to six times less carbon monoxide, (which is very toxic because
it stops the exchange between blood and oxygen), about half
that of unburned hydrocarbons, which are extremely 
carcinogenic, and about half that of nitrogen oxides, which are
among the causes
