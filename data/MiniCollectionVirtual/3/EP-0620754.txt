<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is broadly concerned with 
a method for the recovery of aqueous and organic solvent-based 
printing ink wastes, which are generated in considerable 
volume in commercial printing operations, in order 
to greatly minimize the environmental problems attendant 
to treatment and disposal of such wastes. More particularly, 
it is concerned with such a method of ink waste 
recovery wherein waste ink sludge is first rendered 
flowable and then directed into a hydroheater simultaneously 
with high pressure steam, in order to subject the 
ink wastes to conditions of elevated temperature, pressure 
and intense shear, and thus create a processed output. 
This output can then be dried and powdered, and the 
resultant product can be used in the formulation of ink 
for reuse. Alternately, the hydroheater output may be 
passed through a filter press to yield a pressed cake, 
which can subsequently be dispersed and formulated as an 
ink. Operators of printing equipment must periodically 
clean the inking assemblies associated with such 
equipment, either at the end of a shift or when a new 
printing run is to be set up and made ready. Ink assembly 
cleaning typically involves spraying the inking assembly 
with water and/or other appropriate solvents which is  
 
thereafter collected as ink waste. Wastes of this character 
include relatively large volumes of water, together 
with pigment particles and ink carriers. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
prohibit direct disposal of ink wastes. Accordingly, it 
is common practice to treat such washup wastes with 
cationic and/or anionic polymers as necessary, so that the 
solids fraction of the ink wastes may be readily separated. 
The solids fraction is then allowed to drain for 
periods on the order of twenty-four hours, thereby forming 
a sludge normally containing 10-20% solids therein, and 
including ink solids, surfactants, the previously employed 
separation polymers, and varnishes. Despite these steps, however, disposal of ink 
sludges presents significant problems. In some locales, 
the sludges nay be placed in a landfill, although this 
option is becoming both expensive and of limited viability. 
Another approach is to subject the sludges to pyrolytic 
destruction. Although pyrolytic treatment is 
effective, it is a very expensive proposition, both from 
the standpoints of fuel consumption and shipping to the 
destruction site. As a consequence of these intractable problems, 
printers both large and small are increasingly

A method of recovering printing ink wastes including the steps of 
providing a flowable stream of material including printing ink wastes, heating said flowable 

stream of material and recovering ink wastes, characterized by the steps 
of directing said flowable stream into a confined zone (16), simultaneously passing a 

stream of steam into said zone (16), subjecting said flowable stream of material to 
conditions of elevated temperature and superatmospheric pressure and intense shear by 

directly contacting said flowable stream of material with said steam in said zone (16), to 
thereby create processed ink wastes, and passing said processed ink wastes out of said 

zone (16). 
The method of claim 1, said material 
stream-providing step comprising the steps of: 


obtaining a quantity of printing ink washup waste; 
separating a substantial fraction of the solids 
fraction of said washup waste to tern a sludge; 

and 
agitating said sludge to form said flowable stream. 
The method of claim 1, said printing ink 
wastes being derived from flexographic or lithographic ink 

washup wastes. 
The method of claim 2, said sludge having 
from about 10-20% solids therein. 
The method of claim 1, said flowable stream being directed to a 
hydroheater (16) having respective inlets (82, 84) for said flowable stream and stream of 

steam.  
 
The method of claim 5, said subjecting step comprising the steps of 
directing said flowable stream through a restricted annular orifice (95) within said confined 

zone (16), and passing said stream of steam into said confined zone (16) at a location to 
intersect said flowable stream as the same passes through said restricted annular orifice 

(95). 
The method of claim 1, said flowable stream being subjected to a 
temperature of at least about 149째C (300째F) and a pressure of at least about 413 kPa (60 psi) in said 

confined zone (16). 
The method of claim 7, said temperature 
being from about 149 - 182째C (300-360째F), and said pressure being from 

about 413 - 517 kPa (60-75 psi). 
The method of claim 1, including the steps 
of drying said processed ink wastes after passage thereof 

from said zone. 
The method of claim 9, including the step 
of reducing said dried processed ink wastes to a powder. 
The method of claim 10, said powder having 
an average particle size of from about 0,1 - 0,4 mm (100-400 microns). 
The method of claim 11, including the step 
of mixing said powder with ink carriers to form a printing 

ink.  
 
The method of claim 1, including the step of passing said processed 
ink wastes through a filter press (252) to remove at least a portion of liquid therefrom and 

to form a filter cake. 
The method of claim 13, including the step 
of subdividing said filter cake and mixing said subdivided 

filter cake with ink carriers to form a printing ink. 
Processed ink wastes made in accordance 
with the method of claim 1. 
Dried, processed ink wastes made in accordance 
with the method of claim 9.
