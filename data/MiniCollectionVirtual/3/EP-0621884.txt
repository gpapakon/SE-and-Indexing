<DESCRIPTION>
A process for the production of composites
containing reinforcing fiber and a fluoropolymer.Polymeric composites consisting of a matrix resin
(including fluoropolymers) and a reinforcing fiber is an
area well known in the art. By adding the fiber to the
matrix resin, certain properties of the resin alone are
often improved. These properties can include creep,
tensile strength and modulus, flexural strength and
modulus. Generally speaking, the reinforcing fiber
chosen has a higher tensile modulus and strength than the
polymer alone. When a fluoropolymer is used as the
matrix resin, as described herein, the resulting
composite often has many of the attributes of
fluoropolymers such as high temperature resistance and
chemical resistance, which make such composites useful in
part, for example, for the chemical processing industry
and semiconductor industry. It is the object of this
invention to provide a method for the production of such
fluoropolymer composites that exhibit improved
properties.U.S. Patent 4,163,742
describes a process for making
tetrafluoroethylene copolymer-graphite fiber composite by
mixing the polymer and fiber together in a slurry and
then removing the water to obtain an intimate mix of
fiber and polymer. It is also known that fluoropolymers
have very low surface energy and are difficult to wet in 
an aqueous media for mixing, as well as wet the
reinforcing fiber in the molten state to form a
composite. Thus, very fine particles are used to enhance
the intimacy of the fiber resin mixture. This
complicates mixing by requiring extensive use of organic
solvents or emulsifying agents to assist wetting.
Further, this complicates consolidation by creating a mix
with a very high bulk factor with dry mix typically being
ten times the volume of a consolidated composite.As taught in U.S. Patent 4,163,742, pressing the mix
at 34 450 to 41 340 KPa (5000 to 6000 psi) was required to cold compact it,
allowing a stepwise filling of the mold. In this step
the mix is debulked as air is removed; the resin cold
flows to form a stable block. Subsequent heating
coalesces the block into a solid. This technique is
common with TeflonÂ® materials. Further, experience
showed that heating the resin fiber mix in a mold without
cold compaction caused the resin to flow and leak from
the mold before enough pressure was built up to remove
the air and consolidate the block. However, cold
compaction causes significant fiber breakage and requires
deep draft molds and very high pressures. It is highly
desirable to find a

<CLAIMS>
A process for preconsolidating a porous
fluoropolymer resin-fiber planar layer comprising: heating

said preform layer to above the melt temperature of the
fluoropolymer resin; applying sufficient pressure normal to

the plane of the layer while the layer is unconstrained in
the in-plane directions to cause the molten resin to flow;

orienting said fibers in substantially the plane of the
layer by means of said flow to form a preconsolidated sheet;

and cooling said sheet under pressure.
The process of Claim 1 wherein
said fibers are carbon.
The process of Claims 1 or 2 including forming a
solid shaped composite from a stack of said sheets by

heating said stack to a high enough temperature and applying
sufficient pressure for a sufficient amount of time to form

said solid shaped composite.
