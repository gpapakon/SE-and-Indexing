<ABSTRACT>
The purge installation is composed of an extruder (6), of a cooling tunnel (8) in line with the extruder (6), of an automatic purge unit (1) providing the interface with the subsequent shaping and packaging stations (11), the purge unit (1) having a metal detector (16), a cutting assembly (17) and three outlets, namely an in-line outlet (2), a lateral discharge outlet (5) for the lengths of contaminated sausage into a tray (33) for the collection thereof, and a lateral recycling outlet (3) communicating with the inlet of the extruder through a return loop (4) using conveyor belts. This invention is of interest to the manufacturers of machines for the foodstuffs industry.

Automatic eliminating installation for a
production and packaging line for an extruded

sausage of a doughy material, consisting of an
extruder (6), a cooling tunnel (8) in line with

the extruder, an automatic eliminating unit (1)
ensuring the interface with the subsequent shaping

and packaging stations (11), the eliminating unit
(1), having a metal detector (16), a cutting

assembly (17) and three outputs, one output being
in line (2), a lateral removal output (3) for

sections of contaminated sausage and a lateral

recycling output (5) communicating with the input
of the extruder (6) by means of a return loop (4)

with conveyor belts.
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 1 characterised in that in the

automatic eliminating unit:

the metal detector (16) is arranged at the
input, and
the cutting assembly (17); 

is connected to the detector by a transport
duct (21) fitted with motorised rollers (22,23);
communicates via a supply duct (27) with an
output duct (32) directed in line across a tilting

device (30) which is directed between at least two
positions, one of which corresponds to a position

which is aligned with other guides for the output
which is directly in line (2), and the other of

which is a slanting position towards the top for
the lateral recycling output, said recycling

output comprising a return member (35) of the
sausage towards an output ramp (13) forming the

start of the return loop (4) towards the extruder
(6).
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 2, characterised in that the

supply duct (27) is mounted in a tilting manner to
disengage the output of the aperture of the

cutting assembly (17) in order to allow the cut
section of the sausage to slide into the recovery

trough (33).
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 2 or 3 characterised in that

the cutting assembly (17) is formed of a knife
(26) tilting into a passage window (25). 
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 4 characterised in that the two

longitudinal edges of the knife (26) are sharp.
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 2, characterised in that the

tilting device (30) is formed of a part (31) which
pivots between a slanting low position, a position

of alignment with the supply (27) and direct
output (32) ducts for the sausage, and, lastly, a

position which is slanting towards the top to
return the sausage to recycling by the return

member (35).
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 6, characteirsed in that the

pivoting part (31) tilts in an eccentric fashion
about a median axis in the lower slanting position

in such a manner as to disengage the end of the
supply duct (27) with a view to the direct

descent, into the recovery trough (33), of the cut
section of the sausage.
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claims 2 and 6, characterised in that

the return member (35) is formed of a deflection
drum (36) equipped with two end flanges (37,38) of 

larger diameter, conferring thereon the general
shape of a wheel rim, the annular space of which

is closed by a curved ramp (39) on the perimeter
part, situated at the rear, occupying an angular

section between a quarter and a half-circle behind
the end position of the pivoting part (31) in the

state of being raised to an upper disengaging
position.
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 6, characterised in that the

pivoting part (31) is lowered into the lower
slanting position towards the reception trough

(33).
Automatic eliminating installation
according to Claim 5, characterised in that the

knife (26) cuts a damaged end of the section in
its one-way movement and the other end in its

return pivoting movement in such a manner that its
two sharp edges are used.
