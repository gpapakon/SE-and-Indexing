<ABSTRACT>
In order to receive a sub-assembly (4) which is intalled in a casing or frame (1), the invention provides a supporting panel (3) which is mounted on horizontally extendable telescopic rails (2), at least one telescopic rail being connected to a gas spring (6) which is fitted pivotably beneath it, to the side, and which, in the deflected state, fixes the supporting panel (3), both in the predetermined installation position (ES) and, in the extended state of the telescopic rails (2), in the extended position (AS), in a flexible manner without mechanical stops and which damps the transporting movements. Furthermore, a turntable (5) is provided on the supporting panel (3) as a rotatable securing means for the sub-assembly (4).

<CLAIMS>
Support system for heavy subunits (4) which are 
installed in housings or frameworks (1), for example for 

laser printers in voucher output terminals, having a 
supporting plate (3), which is mounted on two 

horizontally extendable telescopic rails (2), for the 
subunit (4), 


characterized by 
a gas spring (6) which is arranged at the side underneath 
a telescopic rail (2) such that it can pivot and, in the 

extended state, holds the supporting plate (3) fixed both 
in the predetermined retracted position (ES) and in the 

extended position (AS) where the telescopic rails (2) are 
in the extended state. 
Support system according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that 
a gas spring (6), which can pivot, is arranged at the 
side underneath each telescopic rail (2), in order to fix 

the two limit positions (ES, AS) of the horizontally 
displaceable supporting plate (3). 
Support system according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that 
a rotating plate (5) is fitted on the horizontally 
displaceable supporting plate (3), as a rotatable holder 

for the subunit (4).
