<ABSTRACT>
A pressurised container, in particular for dispensing assembly foams, for example single-component polyurethane foams, whose frame (1) has a cylinder (2), a preferably inverted bottom (5), a dome-like top part (8) with a valve (12) for dispensing a container filling consisting of the product component and propellant, and which contains an overhung plunger (14) which is guided on the inner wall of the cylinder (2), separates the propellant-gas chamber from the product component, and has in its plunger top (26) a depression (25) in which a component which is present in the depression (25) and reacts with the product component is closed off relative to the product component by a closure (16), and in which a bursting device (45) is provided in the inner region of the dome-like top part (8), which bursting device opens the closure (16) when the plunger (14) assumes a position directly below the dome-like top part (8).

Pressurized can, in particular for the expulsion of building foams such as 
single-component polyurethane foames, the body (1) of which comprises a 

cylinder (2), a preferably pushed-in bottom (5), a dome-like top section (8) 
with a valve (12) to expel the can contents consisting of product component 

and propellant, and which has a floating plunger guided on the interior wall 
of the cylinder (2), which separates the propellant gas chamber from the 

product component and which has a cavity (25) in its upper side (26), 
characterized in that in the cavity (25) a component reactive with the 

product component is sealed off from the product component by a seal (16), 
and that a trigger device (45) is provided in the dome-like top section (8), 

which opens the seal (16) when the plunger (14) reaches a position 
immediately below the dome-like top section (8). 
Pressurized can according to claim 1, characterized in that the trigger device 
(45) is a spike. 
Pressurized can according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the trigger 
device (45) is placed on the underside of the valve disk (43). 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, charcterized in that 
the seal (16) is a foil. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the seal (16) is made of polyethylene, polypropylene or aluminum. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the seal (16) is made of aluminum, and the cavity (25) is lined with  

 
aluminum foil, such that the seal (16) and the lining are connected to each 

other in a sealed manner. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the reactive component in the cavity (25) is available in a quantity sufficient 

to convert the product component remaining in the pressurized can after 
the plunger (14) strikes up against the dome-like top section (8) into 

enviromentally and/or toxicologically harmless byproducts. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the reactive component is an OH-reactive substance, preferably water, 

a monovalent or polyvalent alcohol, a carbonic acid or a mixture of these, or 
a NH-reactive substance, preferably a monovalent or polyvalent primary or 

secondary amine. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 
the reactive component is or contains a catalytically active substance, 

preferably a monovalent or polyvalent tertiary amine or a metal alkanoate. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 
the product component is a commonly sold prepolymer on i
socyanate basis. 
Pressurized can according to anyone of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
the reactive component consists of water and/or a polyvalent alcohol, 

optionally in conjunction with a catalytically active substance to enhance 
the reaction, or a Pirk catalyst.
