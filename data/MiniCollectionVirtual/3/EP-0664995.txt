<ABSTRACT>
Snoring sounds are detected by a microphone (1) that is built into a headband (9). The microphone connects to an amplifier, filter and demodulator providing an input to a microprocessor that performs an analytical routine. When a snoring sound is identified, an actuation signal is used to operate a sound generator coupled to a small loudspeaker (6') or an earpiece (6). The generator can be programmed to provide a range of signals over a wide frequency spectrum.

Device for the suppression of the snoring
of a sleeper with a detection device (1,2) for detecting

the snoring, a sound generator (4,5,6) and a control (3),
characterised in that by means of the control (3) and the

sound generator (4,5,6) acoustic signals of different
spectral composition can be generated, wherein the spectral

composition of each signal can be selected automatically.
Device of claim 1, characterised in that
the spectral composition of the acoustic signals can be

varied depending on the number of consecutive snoring
sounds.
Device of claim 2, characterised in that
in the acoustic signals spectral components of higher

frequency become stronger with increasing number of
consecutive snoring sounds.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that spectral composition of the acoustic

signals is selected at least partially according to
a random principle.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the spectral composition of at

least some of the signals is varied in time.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the spectral composition of each

acoustic signal substantially comprises only one fundamental
frequency and harmonics.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the control (3) comprises a memory,

where it is registered to which signals the sleeper reacts
strongly.
Device of claim 7, characterised in that
the control registers in the memory the signals by means

of which a snoring phase has been terminated. 
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it comprises a headband (9), in

which a microphone (1) is provided as a part of the detection
device (1,2).
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it comprises a throat microphone

as the microphone.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the sound generator is a forehead

loudspeaker (6') and that means for holding the forehead
loudspeaker (6') are provided.
Device of one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it comprises a headband (9) in

which the sound generator is arranged.
Device for suppressing the snoring of a
sleeper with a detection device (1,2) for detecting the

snoring, with a sound generator (4,5,6) and a control
(3), characterised in that by means of the control (3)

and the sound generator acoustic signals of different
spectral composition and different volume can be generated,

wherein the spectral composition and volume can be
varied automatically.
