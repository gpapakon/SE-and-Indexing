<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the fluorescent whitening of paper surfaces 
using coumarin fluorescent whitening agents. An increasingly important parameter, which determines whether or not a particular 
fluorescent whitening agent can be used in paper applications, is the bleed fastness of the 
whitening agent. This parameter is important e.g. because of toxicological considerations 
(e.g. in relation to the packaging of foodstuffs) and because of technical requirements (e.g. 
for use in photopapers). The stilbene class of fluorescent whitening agents has been very widely used in the paper 
industry, but this whitener class has inadequate bleed fastness to water. In DE-A-2,242,597 preparations are described for the whitening of coating compositions 
for paper. The preparations contain a dispersion whitener in a colourless organic liquid 
which is immiscible with water and has a boiling point above 150°C. Among a wide range 
of dispersion whiteners, there are mentioned certain coumarin fluorescent whitening 
agents. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the coumarin class of fluorescent whitening 
agents, when used in aqueous coating compositions to whiten paper surfaces, exhibits an 
excellent bleed fastness to water, which bleed fastness is considerably better than that of 
stilbene optical whitening agents, while avoiding the problems associated with the use of 
high-boiling organic solvents. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of a 
paper surface, comprising contacting the paper surface with an aqueous coating 
composition containing a coumarin-based fluorescent whitening agent. The coumarin-based fluorescent whitening agent preferably has the formula:  in which R₁ and R₂, independently, are hydrogen or C₁-C₄alkyl or R₁ and R₂, together 
with the nitrogen atom to which they are each attached, are the atoms required to complete 
a pyrazole or triazine ring; R₃ is hydrogen or C₁-C₄alkyl; and R₄ is hydrogen or a residue 
having the formula: 
in which n is 1 or 2 and Y is hydrogen, C₁-C₄alkyl, halogen, preferably bromine or, 
especially, chlorine, SO₃H, SO₂NH₂, SO₂NH(C₁-C₄alkyl), SO₂N(C₁-C₄alkyl)₂, 
SO₂NHCH₂CH₂OH, SO₂NHCH₂CH₂O(C₁-C₄alkyl) or 
SO₂NHCH₂CH₂CH₂N(C₁-C₄alkyl)₂. The compounds of formula (1) are known and have been disclosed, together with their 
production, e.g. in British Patent Specification No. 655,258, U.S. Patent Specification 
No. 3,123,617 and U.S. Patent Specification No. 2,945,033. One preferred class of compounds of
