<ABSTRACT>
This injection circuit, in a thermal imaging cryostat, serves for transferring the detection current into an integrator, which makes it possible, within the cryostat, to convert the point-based information supplied in parallel into information integrated in series. So as not to alter the impedance of the detection circuit (1), a first current mirror (12, 13, 14) recopies the current id from the detector, with gain if necessary. A second current mirror (15, Tx), driven by a reference, supplies a reference current iref which is subtracted from the detection current id; this results in a current id - iref which is used to form an image. This useful current is integrated in a capacitor (18) by means of a third current mirror (16, 17). Application to thermal imaging.
