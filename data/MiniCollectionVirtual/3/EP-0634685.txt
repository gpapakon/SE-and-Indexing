<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display device and a method for producing the
same. More specifically, the present invention relates
to a liquid crystal display device having a display
medium with a structure in which liquid crystal regions
are partitioned by a polymeric material and a method
for producing the same.As display devices utilizing an electro-optic
effect, liquid crystal display devices using nematic
liquid crystals have conventionally been used. Examples
of such liquid crystal display devices include a twisted
nematic (TN) liquid crystal display device and a
super-twisted nematic (STN) liquid crystal display
device. Liquid crystal display devices using ferroelectric
liquid crystal have also been proposed. These
liquid crystal display devices include a pair of glass
substrates, nematic liquid crystal or smectic liquid
crystal provided between the substrates, and two polarizing
plates sandwiching the substrates.Furthermore, as the display devices utilizing
an electro-optic effect, liquid crystal display devices
utilizing a light scattering phenomenon of liquid
crystal, instead of using the polarizing plates, have
been known. Such liquid crystal display devices use a
dynamic scattering (DS) mode and a phase change (PC)
mode. In recent years, liquid crystal display
devices requiring no alignment treatment have been
proposed. Such a liquid crystal display device electrically
regulates a transparent state and an opaque
state by using the birefringence of a liquid crystal.
More specifically, in such a liquid crystal display
device, the refractive index of liquid crystal molecules
with respect to ordinary light is matched with
the refractive index of a supporting medium which
supports the liquid crystal. Thus, liquid crystal
molecules are oriented under the application of a
voltage and hence a transparent state is displayed;
whereas the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules
is disturbed under the application of no voltage and
hence a light scattering state is displayed. Japanese
National Publication No. 61-502128 discloses a specific
method: liquid crystal and photopolymerizable or thermosetting
resin are mixed and resin is cured to deposit
liquid crystal, whereby liquid crystal droplets are
formed in the resin.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 4-338923
and 4-212928 disclose a liquid crystal display
device using polarizing plates with improved viewing
angle characteristics, i.e., a polymer dispersed liquid
crystal device sandwiched with polarizing plates disposed
so
