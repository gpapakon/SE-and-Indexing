<ABSTRACT>
A power supply which incorporates a high frequency inverter and which is suitable for use in conjunction with a fluorescent lamp. The power supply comprises a full wave rectifier (10) and a reservoir capacitor (12) connected across the rectifier for the purpose of providing successive half-cycles of the voltage waveform V2 across the capacitor with a minimum instantaneous voltage level greater than zero. A solid state switching device (14) and an oscillator (15) are connected in circuit with the reservoir capacitor. The oscillator generates a gating signal V3 at a frequency significantly greater than that of the voltage waveform V2 across the reservoir capacitor and applies the gating signal to the switching device. The switching device is arranged to provide an output voltage V4 which has a frequency determined by the applied gating signal V3 and which has a peak amplitude value which varies over successive cycles with the waveform of the voltage V2 across the reservoir capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power supply for an
electrical circuit and, in particular, to a power supply
which incorporates a high frequency invertor which is
suitable for use in conjunction with a fluorescent lamp.
The power supply has been developed primarily as a so-called
electronic ballast for a compact fluorescent lamp
and is hereinafter described in such context. However,
the invention does in fact have broader application.A compact fluorescent lamp is normally connected to
a mains voltage lighting circuit by way of an integral
lamp base which incorporates a power supply in the form
of a switch mode converter-inverter. The supply voltage
is full-wave rectified and the resultant direct current
is fed to an inverter which produces alternating current
at a frequency in the order of 40 to 50 kHz.The converter stage of the conventional power supply
includes a bridge rectifier and a reservoir capacitor
connected across the dc side of the rectifier. The
capacitance value of the reservoir capacitor is chosen to
minimise the ripple voltage at the dc side of the
rectifier and, as a consequence, current is drawn from
the mains supply in the form of a relatively narrow pulse
during each half-cycle of the supply voltage. As a
result, the supply current contains a large number of
harmonics which have the effect of reducing the power
factor, producing rf radiation and otherwise creating
power generation and distribution problems for supply
authorities in areas where large numbers of compact
fluorescent lamps are used.Various proposals have been made for solving the
above mentioned problems, including those disclosed and
referenced in European patent specification number
0296859 (application no. 88305743.2, dated June 23 1988)
entitled "Power factor correcticn circuit". However,
almost all known proposals for improving the shape of the 
mains current waveform and, hence, reducing the harmonic
content, have involved circuits adapted to effect prolonged
current flow through the bridge rectifier during each
half-cycle of the supply voltage whilst maintaining the
high value of the reservoir capacitor for the purpose of
minimising the ripple voltage at the dc side of the
rectifier.European publication EP-A-043112 discloses a lamp
operating power supply circuit which comprises a dc power
source, an inverter including step-up transformer
inductance windings and a controlled transistor switch
connected across the output of the dc source. A high
frequency oscillator is coupled to the transistor switch
for operating the
