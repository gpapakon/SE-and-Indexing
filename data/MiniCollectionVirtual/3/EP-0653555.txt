<ABSTRACT>
The engine has a piston (2) reciprocable within a cylinder (1) and 
provided with at least one 

piston ring (3) to ensure a close sliding fit within the cylinder (1). 
The uppermost piston ring 

(3) is so disposed as to define an annular space (4) above it and 
between the wall of the piston 

(2) and the cylinder wall (3). At least one inlet (5) is provided to 
said annular space (4), and 

means (7) are provided to supply fluid, such as air or harmless gas, to 
the inlet or inlets (5). 

The introduction of the air purges hydrocarbon gas from the space (4) 
and discourages its 

introduction into the space (4). Since hydrocarbon gas mixture in the 
space (4) is unlikely to be 

combusted fully, its exclusion from the space (4) improves the quality 
of the e
xhaust gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for improving exhaust emission for 
internal combustion engines. More particularly, it relates to a system which is intended to 
reduce the amount of unburnt hydrocarbon gas which is emitted by the engine as part of its 
exhaust. Most internal combustion engines operate on the principle of having a plurality of cylinders, 
each containing a respective piston which moves upwardly and downwardly within the 
cylinder. The terms upwardly and downwardly and similar terms are used herein, although 
of course, it will be possible to place the piston/cylinder on its side or at any angle. In such 
cases, the term upwardly and like terms are intended to refer to positions toward the crown 
of the cylinder wherein are located inlet and outlet means together with any ignition means 
while downwardly and like terms are intended to refer to positions within the cylinder remote 
from the inlet means and nearer to the crankshaft being driven by the piston. The piston is not a close fit within the cylinder since their relative diameters may vary in use 
due to the heat generated by the explosions within the cylinder. In order to prevent leakage, 
at least one piston ring is fitted around the piston to engage the walls of the cylinder. Such 
a piston ring encircles the periphery of the piston at a position below its uppermost surface. Thus, there is defined an annular space between the piston wall, the internal cylinder wall and 
at its lower end, the uppermost piston ring. This space may be referred to as a top land.  When fuel/air mixture is introduced into the combustion chamber above the piston, and 
subsequently compressed by the upward motion of the piston this top land becomes filled with 
the mixture. However, when the mixture in the combustion chamber is ignited, the 
combustion flame front cannot fully burn the mixture in this top land since flame access to 
the area is difficult. The depth of this top land may have a depth of 1mm or greater, more usually 3mm or 
greater, particularly in the case of diesels, and its radial dimension may be between 0.1 and 
5mm when the engine is cold. Attempts have been made to reduce the volume of this crevice 
but these can lead to piston/bore interface problems. Attempts to enlarge the flame access 
to the area can lead to a worsened situation or mechanical failure. It is an object of the present invention to purge this top land area with air, or other non-objectionable 
fluid, so that its content of fuel/air mixture is
