<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compact granular detergent 
compositions containing a protease having an isoelectric 
point below 10. More in particular, the present invention relates to 
compact granular dye transfer inhibiting compositions 
comprising a polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agent and a 
protease having an isoelectric point below 10, said 
compositions further comprising a surfactant system which is 
free of alkylbenzene sulfonate. Currently, there is a high interest in "compact" detergent 
products. The particularity of such detergent compositions is 
their relatively high density compared to conventional 
detergent compositions, and their ability to achieve the same 
efficiency than conventional detergent compositions by using  
 
a considerably lesser amount of "compact" detergent 
composition. This particularity is best reflected, in terms 
of composition, by a relatively low amount of inorganic 
filler salt. The efficiency of such "compact" detergent 
composition is best achieved by eliminating the pre-wash 
cycle and by using dispersing and diffusing devices, which 
are put directly in the drum of the washing machine at the 
start of the main washing cycle. Detergent compositions containing proteases are well-known 
in art. By using a protease in a detergent, it is possible to 
hydrolyze the proteins, present in stains and soil on the 
clothes, to such a degree that they become readily soluble in 
water. It is equally well recognized that the relative ability of 
each protease to meet various performance criteria is among 
others depending on the composition of the detergent matrix. 
As a consequence, the detergent formulator is faced with a 
difficult task of providing compact detergent compositions 
containing a protease, wherein said protease has an excellent 
detergency performance. The present invention is based on the unexpected finding 
that in a "compact" matrix containing a polymeric dye 
transfer inhibiting agent and a non-alkylbenzene sulfonate 
surfactant system, the detergency performance of a protease 
having an isoelectric point below 10 outperforms other 
proteases having an isoelectric point of higher than 10 such 
as Savinase®, Opticlean® , Maxacal®, Purafect®, and 
Esperase®. This finding allows to formulate compact granular detergent 
compositions providing both excellent cleaning and fabric 
care properties on cotton and woollen fabrics. According to another embodiment of this invention a process 
is also provided for laundering operations involving colored 
fabr
