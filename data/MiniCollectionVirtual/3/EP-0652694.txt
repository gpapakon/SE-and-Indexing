<ABSTRACT>
A control apparatus (controller) has a printed circuit board (1) which is fitted with a circuit. Power components (2) which are to be cooled and are electrically connected to the circuit are mounted on cooling surfaces (6) which are part of a heat sink (3) or of a housing (casing) (9, 10). The heat sink (3) or the housing (9, 10) is connected to the printed circuit board (1) at the edge such that the component side of the latter is aligned with the cooling surfaces (6). All the components can thus be positioned in an automated manner, in one operation.

<CLAIMS>
Control unit for a motor vehicle, having a 
housing (9, 10) in which a printed circuit board (1, 18) 

carrying an electronic circuit is arranged, having a heat 
sink (3) with a cooling surface (6), heat-generating 

components (2) connected to the circuit being fastened to 
the cooling surface (6), and the cooling surface (6) 

being approximately flush with the top side or the bottom 
side of the printed circuit board (1, 18), characterized 

in that the printed circuit board (1, 18) and the heat 
sink (3) are thermally decoupled, in that the heat 

sink (3) is arranged at the edge of the printed circuit 
board (1, 18), and in that the heat-generating components 

(2) are constructed as SMD components. 
Control unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the heat sink (3) is a part of the 

housing (9, 10). 
Control unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the heat sink (3) is fastened to the printed 

circuit board (1, 18) with screws or rivets. 
Control unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the heat sink (3) is soldered to the printed 

circuit board (1, 18). 
Control unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the heat sink (3) is pluggably fastened to the 

printed circuit board (1, 18). 
Control unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the housing has a housing upper part (9) and a 

housing lower part (10) which bear against the cooling 
surfaces (6) and clamp the heat sink (3) between them.
