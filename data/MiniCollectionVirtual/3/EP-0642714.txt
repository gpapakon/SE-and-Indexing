<ABSTRACT>
In a radio receiver with digital signal processing, a first and a second auxiliary signal are derived from a received stereo multiplex signal. The first auxiliary signal depends on the presence of signal components, the frequency of which is above the useful frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal, and the second auxiliary signal depends on the symmetry of the side bands of the stereo auxiliary carrier. The first and second auxiliary signals are combined to form an interference signal indicating the existence of interference. At least one control signal for application to the audio signals obtained by decoding the stereo multiplex signal is derived from the interference signal.

Method for digitally processing received
broadcast radio signals, where a first and a second

auxiliary signal (H1, H2) are derived from a received
stereo multiplex signal (MPX 1) , where the first

auxiliary signal (H1) is dependent on the presence of
signal components whose frequency is above a useful

frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal (MPX 1),
and where the second auxiliary signal (H2) is dependent

on the symmetry of the sidebands of the stereo
auxiliary carrier, where the first and the second

auxiliary signal (H1) are combined to form an
interference signal indicating the presence of

interference, and where at least one control signal (D,
AFE-AMU) for influencing the audio signals (L, R)

obtained by decoding (8) the stereo multiplex signal is
derived from the interference signal.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the first and the second auxiliary signal (H1, H2)
are converted (42, 43) into binary signals (AHD, ASD)

which are logically combined to form the interference
signal (DD1).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the first and the second auxiliary signal (H1, H2)
are weighted with a respective coefficient (a1, b1) and

are added (38), and 
in that
, depending on whether the
resultant sum is greater than or less than a threshold

value, a binary interference signal is produced. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

a first control signal (AFE, AMU) is produced for
attenuating the audio signals (L, R), and a second

control signal (D) is produced for reducing the channel
separation in the stereo decoder (8) during the

occurrence of interference, and 
in that
 the first and
the second auxiliary signal (H1, H2) are added after

weighting with various coefficients (a1, b1) in order
to form a respective control signal (D, AFE-AMU), 
in
that
 a respective binary interference signal is
produced from the sums by comparison with a threshold

value, and the first and the second control signal
(AFE-AMU, D) are derived from said binary interference

signal.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the interference signal
(DD1) is subjected to time-domain filtering (39).
Method according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the time-domain filtering (39) is formed from a
pulse length discriminator (45) and a subsequent

integrator (46, 47) using different time constants for
the integration directions.
Method according to one of Claims 5 or 6,

characterized in that
 the filtered interference signal
(AMU, AD1) is multiplied (40, 33) by a field strength

signal (AFE, WF2) which is dependent on the reception
field strength.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that

a first filtered interference signal (AMU) is
multiplied by a first field strength signal (AFE) in

order to form a control signal (AFE-AMU) for
attenuating the audio signals, and 
in that
 a second
filtered interference signal (AD1) is multiplied by a

second field strength signal (WF2) in order to form a
control signal (D) which reduces the channel

separation.
Broadcast radio receiver with digital signal
processing having first means (13, 14, 15) for forming

a first auxiliary signal (H1) from a received stereo 
multiplex signal, having second means (8, 16, 17) for

forming a second auxiliary signal (H2), which is
derived from the stereo multiplex signal, where the

first auxiliary signal is dependent on the presence of
signal components whose frequency is above the useful

frequency range of the stereo multiplex signal, and the
second auxiliary signal is dependent on the symmetry of

the sidebands of the stereo auxiliary carrier, having
means (38) for forming an interference signal (DD1),

which indicates the presence of interference, by
combining the first and the second auxiliary signal

(H1, H2), and having means (40, 33) for deriving at
least one control signal (AFE-AMU, D) for influencing

the audio signals (L, R) obtained by decoding (8) the
stereo multiplex signal.
