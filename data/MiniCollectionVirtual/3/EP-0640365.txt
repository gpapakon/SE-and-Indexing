<ABSTRACT>
A toy character, for example a baby duck, having a 
body, has at least two user operable and movable features 

(2,3,8) mounted on the body. An actuating mechanism within 
the body and coupled to the features includes an elongate 

flexible cord (19) urged into a first retracted position 
and extending through a hole (20) in the body. When the 

flexible cord (20) is pulled away from the first position 
against the urging action, both features are moved. The 

features may be the duck's wings and a sound generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a toy character. In accordance with the present invention, a toy 
character has a body; at least two user operable and 
movable features mounted on the body; and an actuating 
mechanism within the body and coupled to the features, the 
actuating mechanism including an elongate, flexible member 
urged into a first, retracted position and extending 
through a hole in the body, whereby when the flexible 
member is pulled away from the first position against the 
urging action, both features are moved. The invention provides a particularly attractive 
feature for use within a toy character in which pulling the 
flexible member causes at least two features to be 
operated. A variety of features could be used including 
a sound generator which, in the case of a toy duck for 
example could generate a quacking sound, and a movable limb 
or pair of limbs, such as movable wings. It is important that the features can be actuated 
relatively easily and simply and that there is a minimum of 
complexity within the actuating mechanism in view of the 
treatment which the toy character is likely to receive. 
Preferably, therefore the actuating mechanism includes a 
first actuator coupled to the first feature, a second 
actuator coupled to the second feature, and a drive member 
coupled to the first and second actuators and to the 
flexible member. In the preferred example, the character further 
comprises a first pulley mounted non-rotatably to the drive 
member and cooperating with the flexible member such that 
movement of the flexible member causes the pulley and hence 
the drive member to rotate. Typically, the second actuator will comprise an 
auxiliary flexible member connected to a second pulley 
mounted non-rotatably on the drive member, whereby rotation 
of the second pulley causes the second feature to be moved. The features could be positioned at various parts of 
the body of the toy character but in order to minimise the  
 
pulling strength required, preferably the first feature is 
positioned so that its movement characteristic is in 
substantially the same direction as the pulling direction 
of the flexible member. The urging action could be provided by specific urging 
means associated with the flexible member, for example a 
spring. However, conveniently at least one of the features 
includes resilient means to urge the feature into a rest 
position, the resilient means providing the urging action 
on the flexible member. An example of a toy character in accordance with the

<CLAIMS>
A toy character having a body; at least two user 
operable and movable features (2,3,8) mounted on the body; 

and an actuating mechanism within the body and coupled to 
the features (2,3,8), the actuating mechanism including an 

elongate, flexible member (19) urged into a first, 
retracted position and extending through a hole (20) in the 

body, whereby when the flexible member is pulled away from 
the first position against the urging action, both features 

are moved. 
A toy character according to claim 1, wherein the 
actuating mechanism includes a first actuator (24,25) 

coupled to the first feature (2,3), a second actuator (22) 
coupled to the second feature (8), and a drive member (14) 

coupled to the first and second actuators and to the 
flexible member (19). 
A toy character according to claim 2, further 
comprising a first pulley (18) mounted non-rotatably to the 

drive member (14) and cooperating with the flexible member 
(19) such that movement of the flexible member (19) causes 

the pulley and hence the drive member (14) to rotate. 
A toy character according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
wherein the second actuator comprises an auxiliary flexible 

member (22) connected to a second pulley (17) mounted non-rotatably 
on the drive member (14), whereby rotation of the 

second pulley causes the second feature (8) to be moved. 
A toy character according to claim 4, wherein the 
first and second pulleys (17,18) are mounted coaxially to 

the drive member. 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the first feature is positioned so that its 

movement characteristic is in substantially the same 
direction as the pulling direction of the flexible member. 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein at least one of the features includes 

resilient means (11) to urge the feature (2,3) into a rest 
 

position, the resilient means providing the urging action 
on the flexible member. 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein one of the features comprises a sound 

generating mechanism (8). 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein one of the features comprises a movable 

limb (2,3). 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the flexible member (19) comprises a 

flexible cord. 
A toy character according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the body is made of a soft material.
