<ABSTRACT>
Signals from multiple signal paths are received using a multi-element 
antenna (20) and a beam-forming network (36). Signals from each of the antenna 

elements are sampled (34) to form a sample vector. Several sample vectors are used 
to form an auto-covariance matrix. A singular value decomposition of the auto-covariance 

matrix is used to form three matrices. The first matrix is used to 
determine the number of signal paths and the second matrix is used to form several 

polynomials. The polynomial roots that are on or near the unit circle are used to 
determine points on the unit circle that are associated with each signal path. Each 

point on the unit circle is used to calculate weights for a beam-forming network (36) 
that forms a receive beam for each signal path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of receiving communication signals.Many communications systems such as cellular systems and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) systems suffer from a performance loss which results from multiple signal paths between a receiver and transmitter. This problem is often referred to as inter-symbol interference in communication systems that transmit information using symbols. Prior communication systems address this problem using a receiver that includes an adaptive equalizer which compensates for channel conditions such as multi-path conditions. Adaptive equalization techniques are discussed in "Adaptive Equalization for TDMA Digital Mobile Radio", J. G. Proakis, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, pp. 333-41, Vol. 40, No. 2, May 1991. When a system includes moving receivers, such as a receiver in an automobile, channel conditions may change relatively quickly and result in improper compensation by the receiver's equalizer. For example, an automobile's motion may result in improper compensation by losing or gaining signal paths at a rate that is faster than the rate at which the equalizer can adapt. As a result, when a signal path is lost, a receiver's performance is degraded by both the improper compensation of the receiver's equalizer and by the loss of signal power provided by the lost signal path, and when a signal path is gained, improper compensation may result in inter-symbol interference.US-A-5218359 discloses an adaptive array antenna having a plurality of antenna elements, related weight circuits for weighting amplitude and phase of receive signal by each antenna element, and a combiner for combining weighed signals, and a plurality of antenna beams at the same time by determining weights of said weight circuits, so that a plurality of receive signals due to multipath transmission are received for obtaining high receive level while avoiding multipath interference. Receive signals are converted to digital form, which is stored in a memory for calculation, in which it is first determined whether a receive signal in each beam direction exists or not, selecting at least one direction beam in which receive signal in that direction beam has less mutual delay time from reference signal in reference direction beam than a predetermined delay time, adjusting phase of all the selected direction beams which have selected receive signal so that receive phase of all the selected direction beams are in phase, and determining weights of said weight circuit so that the
