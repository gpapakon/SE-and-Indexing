<ABSTRACT>
The basic body (5) has a base (17) from which protrude two arms (18,18') defining a groove-type recess (22) along which runs at least one runner (7,7'). Guide pieces (12) are positioned inside the recess between the runner and the arms flanking it. Clamps (26) formed by clamping screws between the two arms deform the arms in relation to the base and adjust the width of the recess. The basic body near the arms have grooves (34) affecting its deformation properties. A lengthwise groove (36) parallel with the longitudinal axis of the recess is contained in the outer surface (35,35') of the basic body.

Linear guide with a main body unit (5) which has a base (17) and, projecting
from the base, two arms (18, 18
1
) the sides of which end in a groove-like
hollow section (22), with at least one slide (7, 7
1
) meshing with the groove-like
hollow section (22) and movable relative to the main body unit (5) along the

length of the groove-like hollow section (22) and with, on the inside of the
groove-like hollow section (22), guide means (12) acting between the slide (7,

7
1
) and the arms (18, 18
1
) running alongside it, whereby tensioning means
(26) are available, acting between the two arms (18, 18
1
), which enable an
elastic reshaping of the arms (18, 18
1
) to be made with reference to the base
(17), so as to allow a variable setting to be made of the width of the groove-like

hollow section (22) in the area of the guide means (12), 
characterized in
that
, in the area of one or both arms on the outer surface (35, 35
1
) of the main
body unit (5) opposite the groove-like hollow section (22), a longitudinal

groove (36) is provided extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
groove-like hollow section (22), whereby the tensioning means (26) to the

side of the longitudinal groove (36) opposite the base (17) make contact with
the arm (18, 18
1
) in question, in such a way that the longitudinal groove (36) is
positioned between the tensioning means (26) and the base (17).
Linear guide according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the arms (18, 18
1
)
form one piece with the base (17).
Linear guide according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the tensioning
means (26) are formed at least partly from tensioning elements (27) fixed in or

to both arms (18, 18
1
) and crossing the groove-like hollow section (22) in the
manner of a bridge.
Linear guide according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the tensioning
elements (27) are formed from tensioning screws. 
Linear guide according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
,
distributed along the length of the groove-like hollow section (22), several

tensioning means (26) are provided, positioned at a distance from each other,
which, in particular, can be operated independently of one another.
Linear guide according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the
longitudinal groove (36) is in the area where the arm (18, 18
1
) in question and
the base (17) meet.
Linear guide according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
, in the
area of one or several arms (18, 18
1
), at least one transverse groove (38) is
provided on the outer surface (35, 35
1
) of the main body unit (5) opposite the
groove-like hollow section (22), extending parallel to the downward orientation

(42) of the groove-like hollow section (22).
Linear guide according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the arm (18, 18
1
) in
question has several transverse grooves (38) positioned along it at a distance

from each other.
Linear guide according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in that
 the arm in
question is subdivided by at least one transverse groove into several shaped

segments (43), with each of which at least one tensioning means (26) makes
contact.
Linear guide according to one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the
transverse grooves (38) each join up with a longitudinal groove (36).
Linear guide according to one of claims 7 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the
transverse grooves (38) extend to the e
ntire height of the arm (18, 18
1
) to
which each of them relates.
Linear guide according to one of claims 7 to 11, 
characterized in that
 at least
one transverse groove (38) is open towards the free end of the arm (18, 18
1
)
to which it belongs, whereby the opposite end of this transverse groove (38),

facing the base (17), lies opposite the opening of a fastening bore, passing
through the base (17). 
Linear guide according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 the
guide means (12) on each side of the slide (7, 7
1
) are equipped with at least
one guide unit (29) which contains a first carrying component (52) relating to

the main body unit (5) and a second carrying component (53) relating to the
slide (7, 7
1
), whereby each carrying component (52, 53) carries at least one
rod-shaped bearing element (48) constituting a rolling surface (46) and

whereby, between the carrying components (52, 53) of one particular guide
unit (29) a set of rolling components (47) is provided adjacent to the bearing

elements (48).
Linear guide according to claim 13, 
characterized in that
, on each carrying
