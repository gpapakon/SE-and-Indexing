<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an oriented, heat shrinkable, thermoplastic vacuum 
bag (12) 

having a protective heat shrinkable patch attached thereto such that 
said heat 

shrinkable patch (8) covers substantially all area exposed to bone (6), 
thereby protecting 

the bag from puncture by sharp protruding bones in bone-in cuts of meat 
which are vacuum packaged within the bags. The protection is especially 

directed 
to prevention of bag puncture by, bone-in cuts of both fresh and smoked 

or processed meat. The bag produced by this method is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the packaging of bone-in cuts of meat as well as
processed meats. In particular, this invention relates to a heat shrinkable bag
with a heat shrinkable protective patch which prevents or reduces the
likelihood that a bone will completely puncture and rupture a thermoplastic
vacuum bag-and-patch combination.The use of heat shrinkable thermoplastic as flexible packaging materials
for vacuum packaging various foodstuffs including meat is well-known. Such
plastic materials, however, while in general quite successful for packaging meat
understandably have difficulties in successfully packaging sharp or bony products.
For example, attempts to package bone-in primal cuts of meat usually
result in an unsatisfactorily large number of bag failures due to bone punctures.
The use of cushioning materials such as paper, paper laminates, wax
impregnated cloth, and various types of plastic inserts have proved to be less
than totally satisfactory in solving the problem. The preparation of special cuts
of meat or close bone trim with removal of offending bones has also been attempted.
However, this is at best only a limited solution to the problem since it
does not offer the positive protection necessary for a wide variety of commercial
bone-in types of meat. Furthermore, removal of the bone is a relatively expensive
and time consuming procedure.An example of the prior art method of protecting a thermoplastic bag
from puncture is shown in U. S. Patent No. 2,891,870 issued on June 23, 1959
to Meyer S. Selby et al. In the Selby patent the exposed bone in a bone-in cut
of meat is covered with a wax impregnated cloth and the thus protected meat is 
placed in a heat shrinkable plastic bag. Another example of the prior art methods of
protecting a thermoplastic bag from puncture is shown in US-A-4755403 which
teaches a method of providing an external multi-layer protective patch for a heat
shrinkable thermoplastic bag, said patch being located on what becomes the side of
the bag after the product is loaded into the bag. While this Patent provides bone-caused
rupture protection along a small area of the side of the bag such as for
example, turkey leg bone punctures, it does nothing to protect a bag containing an
end-bone piece of meat such as a ham shank.Another side wall patch teaching may be found in AU-A-11228/88.FR-A-2158368 discloses a method of forming a tetrahedral container in which
a rupturable slit for receiving a drinking straw is formed at the fold line of a lay flat
tube and is then
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of making a container having a patch (8) attached thereto,
comprising:


producing an oriented thermoplastic heat shrinkable tubing in a first lay flat
configuration; applying a patch (8) of plastic film to the tubing by adhering at least

one heat shrinkable patch (8) to one surface of the tubing using an adhesive sealing
means so that a patched tubing results; reconfiguring the thermoplastic tubing to a

second lay flat configuration by inflating the patched tubing and then deflating and
flattening the thus inflated patched tubing to the second lay flat configuration inclined

a desired number of degrees relative to the first lay flat configuration, with the heat
shrinkable patch (8) relocated in a desired position on the patched tubing; and then

forming a bag (12) from the tubing in the second lay flat configuration, by sealing and
cutting the tubing while in said second lay flat configuration.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said oriented, heat
shrinkable, thermoplastic tubing, and said heat shrinkable patch are both biaxially

oriented.
A method as chimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein two or more of said
heat shrinkable patches are attached to the heat shrinkable thermoplastic tubing.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
produced bags (12) are side seal bags.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said at least
one heat shrinkable patch is attached to the exterior surface of the bag.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein said
oriented, heat shrinkable, thermoplastic tubing comprises a multiple layer film.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said heat
shrinkable patch comprises an oriented heat shrinkable thermoplastic film, preferably

a single layer film.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein said heat 
shrinkable patch comprises a multiple layer film, preferably a four layer film (14, 16,

18, 20), of oriented heat shrinkable thermoplastic film.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the four layers of said heat
shrinkable patch material comprise two outer layers (14, 16) comprising linear low

density polyethylene and two inner layers (18, 20) comprising ethylene-vinyl acetate
copolymer.
A method as claimed in claim 9, wherein said two outer layers (14,
16) comprise a major amount by weight of linear low density polyethylene and a

minor amount by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate having a vinyl acetate content
in the range from about 7% to about 12% by weight, and from about 0% to about 5%

by weight pigments and additives; and said inner two layers (18, 20) comprise an
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer having from about 20% to about 35% by weight

vinyl acetate content.
A method as claimed in claim 7, in combination with any one of
claims 8 to 10 wherein said heat shrinkable patch material has been cross-linked by

irradiation to the equivalent of a dosage level in the range of from about 4.5 to about
13 MR.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11 comprising
printing on said bag, preferably before said heat shrinkable patch is attached.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, comprising
printing on said heat shrinkable patch (8), preferably before attaching to said heat

shrinkable bag tubing.
