<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to alkali-developable photosensitive or
thermosetting materials for color filter use and to color filters
prepared therefrom and also relates to alkali-developable photosensitive
or thermosetting resin compositions useful for the preparation of said
materials for color filter use and to photochemically or thermally
polymerizable unsaturated compounds useful for said resin compositions.The materials for color filter use can be utilized as inks in the
preparation of color filters for a variety of multicolor displays and
optical instruments such as color liquid crystal display devices, color
facsimile and image sensors. Moreover, color filters prepared from said
materials can be utilized as filters for displays such as television,
video monitors and computers. In addition to the aforementioned inks
for color filters, the resin compositions can be used for protective
films on color filters and for solder resists in the preparation of
printed circuit boards. The polymerizable unsaturated compounds are
used in the preparation of said resin compositions. A conventional color liquid crystal display device constructed of
liquid crystals and a color filter as controller of the transmission or
reflection of light, the color filter in question is prepared by
forming red, green and blue pixels and a black matrix on a glass
substrate by dyeing or printing. A color filter prepared by the dyeing
process is mainly used where images of a particularly high degree of
fineness are required.According to the dyeing process, a color filter is prepared by
forming a black matrix on a glass substrate, applying a photosensitive
solution which is prepared by sensitizing natural photosensitive resins
such as gelatins or synthetic photosensitive resins such as amine-modified
poly(vinyl alcohol) with dichromic acid, exposing through a
photomask and developing for patterning or utilizing a masking coat and
dyeing with an acid dye and the like. With the dyeing process, however,
it is necessary to apply a dye-resisting treatment to those regions
which require no coloring in order to prevent the color in the first
dyeing from mixing with that in the second dyeing. This treatment
complicates the manufacturing process. Moreover, coating films present
problems in the reliability of such properties as light resistance, heat
resistance and moisture resistance [Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho No. Hei 1-52,738
(1989)].On the other hand, the printing process uses inks prepared by 
dispersing pigments in thermosetting resins or
