<ABSTRACT>
A vessel for use in the refinement or production of oil/petroleum products at sea at a location at a distance from the coast is designed as a ship (1) of the lash type, in which there are integrated a number of barges (2) which can be removed from the ship's hull and used as independent transport vessels for the transport of products to and from shore. In the ship there is integrated manufacturing or production equipment in a unit (4). This unit (4) can also be provided in a barge which is part of the lash construction. The manufacting equipment in the unit (4) is preferably positioned close to the ship's means of propulsion and control. In the ship's construction between the barges and the production equipment (2, 4), there are integrated transport systems for the products obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for the refinement or production 
of oil/petroleum or gas products at sea on a factory or production 
ship. The invention is thereby also intended to include 
devices where refinement/production is conducted on a combination 
of land and sea-based installations. The expression ship 
is intended to cover any type of installation at sea. In the extraction of oil or petroleum at sea, the production of 
oil products, i.e. the extraction of these from the oil-bearing 
strata, is normally conducted by on board oil installations. In 
the production process gas is often included and until now it 
has been difficult to exploit this by means of those methods in 
use to date. In smaller oilfields and in test drillings, oil 
production vessels have also been used to some extent, in which 
the oil is brought up from the reservoir and placed in intermediate 
storage in the ship's tanks before being further 
transported by another ship to shore or to a further refinement 
site. Oil production ships of this kind have proved to be a 
rational solution for their special purposes but in reality 
constitute a relatively expensive solution, at any rate when it 
comes to the normal extraction of oil/petroleum products. The concept of exploiting oil/petroleum products in or close to 
the extraction site has also been contemplated previously, by 
locating refining or factory equipment there, either on a 
platform or on a special ship for this purpose, which may be 
capable of producing electrical energy for bringing the oil 
ashore. Such ideas have been under consideration as a replacement 
for gas power stations in order to keep the pollution away 
from shore. However, no solution has been found to date as to 
how to implement this kind of production or further refinement 
of produced oil/petroleum or gas products in an economically justifiable 
fashion, which would enable the operation to be conducted 
in a profitable manner.  
 The object of the invention is to provide a device which makes 
this kind of production and further refinement possible and 
which will allow oil/petroleum or gas products to be produced and 
brought ashore in an economically justifiable way and/or 
perform the refinement and further conversion of the products 
into more valuable products, which can also be transported 
ashore or to a utilization site in a more rational manner. These objects are achieved with a device which is characterized 
by the features of the patent claim 1. The invention also concerns the

<CLAIMS>
A vessel for use in the refinement of oil/petroleum or 
gas, the gas also taken from pure gas fields, or in the 

production of end products based on oil/petroleum or gas at 
sea, at a distance from shore, which vessel comprises 

production and/or refining equipment,
 
characterised in that as a vessel a ship of the lash type is 

used with appurtenant, replaceable barges, that the ship's 
production/refining equipment is provided in a section of the 

vessel or in one of the replaceable barges, and that the ship 
is equipped with permanent equipment in the form of pipelines, 

valve stations, pumps, etc., for the transfer of oil/petroleum 
or gas crude products for production to and finished product 

from the production/refining equipment and to the ship's 
storage tanks and/or the barges. 
A vessel according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the ship comprises barges and/or 

container tanks both for gaseous and liquid/particulate formed 
products, particularly hydrogen and carbon black. 
A vessel according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the ship's production/refining equipment respectively the 

barge with the equipment is positioned close to the ship's 
means of propulsion and control particularly in the aft area 

of the ship.
