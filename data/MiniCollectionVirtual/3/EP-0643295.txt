<ABSTRACT>
A machine for inspecting containers is 
disclosed which has a lower cabinet for enclosing a 

container as it is conveyed therethrough for inspection. 
A monitor module 24 is supported 34 for 

displacement between an up position above the lower 
cabinet and an operative position in front of the 

lower cabinet. A force 50 for resisting the 
displacement of the supported monitoring module is 

defined at any location between the up and operative 
positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Containers such as glass bottles may be formed 
with defects which make the container unacceptable. 
To identify unacceptable bottles, the bottles are 
conveyed through one or more inspection stations. 
Among current inspections are inner and outer finish 
(threaded area), top surface of finish, and wall 
thickness inspection. State of the art machines are electronically 
controlled with pendant controls that are supported 
for displacement by the operator to locate the 
control at a convenient location. The pendant 
control support is conventionally secured to a 
suitable pedestal or beam. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved pendant control for a container 
inspecting machine. The invention generally comprises a machine for 
inspecting containers comprising
 
   a lower cabinet for enclosing a container as it 
is conveyed therethrough,
 
   a monitor module,
 
   means for supporting said monitor module for 
displacement between an up position above said lower 
cabinet and an operative position in front of said 
lower cabinet, and
 
   said supporting means including means for 
defining a force for resisting the displacement of 
said supported monitor module at any location between 
said up and operative positions. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
portion of this specification and from the accompanying 
drawings which illustrate in accordance with the 
mandate of the patent statutes a presently preferred 
embodiment incorporating the principles of the  
 
invention. Referring to the drawings: 
Figure 1 is a front view of a container 
inspecting machine made in accordance with the 
teachings of the present invention; Figure 2 is a left side view of a portion of 
the machine shown in Figure 1; Figure 3 is a view similar to that of Figure 2 
with the monitor module of the machine displaced to 
an operative position; and Figure 4 is a top view illustrating the structure 
for supporting the monitor module for displacement 
between the up and down operative positions. A machine for inspecting containers is shown in 
Figure 1. A conveyor 10 runs through the inspection 
machine carrying containers 12 like glass bottles 
through one or more inspection stations. The lower 
cabinet or enclosure 14 encloses the inspection 
device or devices (a plug gage 15 is shown) and also 
encloses the handling mechanism, here, the conveyor. 
Secured above this lower cabinet on four posts 16 is 
an upper control cabinet 18 which has a

<CLAIMS>
A machine for inspecting containers 12 
comprising a lower cabinet 14 for enclosing a 

container as it is conveyed 10 therethrough, and a 
monitor module 24, characterized by 

   means 36 for supporting said monitor 
module 24 for displacement between an up position 

above said lower cabinet 14 and an operative position 
in front of said lower cabinet 14, and 

   said supporting means including means 50 
for defining a force for resisting the displacement 

of said supported monitor module at any location 
between said up and operative positions. 
A machine for inspecting containers according 
to claim 1, characterized in that said force defining 

means 50 comprises a charged cylinder. 
A machine for inspecting containers according 
to claim 1, characterized in that said supporting 

means comprises a pair of brackets 36 pivotally 
secured 34 at one end to a side of said monitor 

module and pivotally secured 40 at the other end to 
said lower cabinet. 
A machine for inspecting containers according 
to claim 3, characterized in that said force defining 

means includes 
   a pair of charged cylinders 50, each 

pivotally secured 40 to said lower cabinet and each 
having an extendable rod 48, and 

   a pair of control levers 46, each secured 
at one end to the other end of one of said brackets 

and pivotally secured at the other control lever end 
to one of said rods. 
A machine for inspecting containers according 
to claim 1, further comprising an upper cabinet 

including a pocket 30, 32 for receiving said monitor 
module 24 when it is displaced to said up position.
