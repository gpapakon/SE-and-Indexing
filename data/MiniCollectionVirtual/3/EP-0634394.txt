<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic
fluorine compound suitable as a dispersing agent for
dispersing fine particles of various metals, metal
oxides, metal salts, fluorocarbons, fluorine-containing
resins, and the like into various resins or the solutions
thereof. In more particular, it relates to an
organic fluorine compound which is capable of imparting
such properties as water repellency, oil repellency,
soil resistance, mold release, and rust prevention to
the surface of articles obtained from such dispersions
and is particularly excellent in dispersion stability.A ferromagnetic metal film type magnetic
recording medium obtained by forming a magnetic layer of
cobalt, nickel, iron or an alloy comprising said metals
as the principal component by a vacuum film-forming
process, such as vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering and
ion plating, on a substrate, e.g. a film of polymer such
as polyester and polyimide, aluminum alloy sheet, glass
sheet, etc. can potentially have a drastically increased
recording density. To realize such increased density,
however, it is necessary to make the magnetic layer very
thin and at the same time to make the surface of the 
medium as flat as possible. However, since these
measures act toward lowering the endurance reliability
of said medium, a variety of measures have been
investigated with the aim of improving the endurance
reliability. For example, in a magnetic disc unit used
in the external memory of electronic computers, a so-called
contact-start-stop (CSS) system is in use wherein
generally the magnetic head floats above the magnetic
disc surface when the disc is in operation and contacts
with the disc surface during stoppage. For such a
system, a method have been proposed wherein fine
irregulalities (protruded parts) are formed on the disc
surface, a ferromagnetic metal thin film is then formed
thereon, and a protective layer and a lubricant layer
are further provided on the ferromagnetic metal thin
film, the protective layer comprising graphite, SiO2
etc. as the main component and the lubricant layer
comprising a perfluoropolyether having modified or
unmodified molecular terminals.In magnetic coating materials used in magnetic
tapes, magnetic discs, magnetic cards, etc., the
dispersibility and the dispersion stability of
ferromagnetic fine particles are important factors in
manifestation of magnetic properties. Further, when
ferromagnetic metal fine particles comprising iron, its
alloy, or the like is used as such ferromagnetic fine
particles, the storage
