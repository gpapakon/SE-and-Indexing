<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a toner for developing an 
electrostatic image, including the steps of: adding to an 

aqueous dispersion medium a polymerizable monomer 
composition comprising at least a polymerizable monomer 

and a colorant uniformly dissolved or dispersed in the 
polymerizable monomer, wherein the aqueous dispersion 

medium containing as a dispersion stabilizer a hardly 
water-soluble metal hydroxide colloid formed by a 

reaction of a water-soluble polyvalent metal salt with an 
alkali metal hydroxide in an aqueous phase; and 

subjecting the polymerizable monomer composition to 
suspension polymerization, thereby to produce particles 

having a volume-average particle size in the range of 
from 2 to 20 µm and a particle size distribution (a ratio 

of volume-average particle size/number-average particle 
size) of not more than 1.6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a toner for developing an electrostatic latent image (electrostatic
charge image) which may be formed by an image forming method such as electrophotography and electrostatic
recording.Conventionally, an electrical or electrostatic latent image formed by an image forming apparatus such as electrophotographic
apparatus and electrostatic recording apparatus is subsequently developed by use of a toner to form a
toner image. The toner image is transferred onto a transfer material such as paper, as desired, and then is fixed onto
the transfer material by at least one of various methods such as those utilizing heat, pressure and solvent vapor to
provide a copied product.Heretofore, a toner used for such a purpose has generally been manufactured by heat-fusing and mixing predetermined
components such as colorant, charge controlling agent and anti-offset agent in a thermoplastic resin to uniformly
disperse them in the resin so as to provide a composition, pulverizing the composition and then classifying the
resultant pulverized product.Such a toner preparation process (i.e., pulverization process) is capable of producing a toner having good characteristics
to a certain degree, but the materials for toner usable in the pulverization process has a certain limitation.
That is, the selection of such materials is rather limited. For example, the composition produced by the above mentioned
heat-fusing and mixing step is required to be a species thereof which is capable of being pulverized and classified by
means of an economically usable manufacturing system. In order to satisfy this requirement, the composition produced
by the heat-fusing and mixing step must be formed as a sufficiently fragile product. For this reason, when the composition
is actually intended to be pulverized, the resultant particles are liable to have a broad distribution in their particle
sizes. Particularly, when a toner capable of providing a copied product with good resolution and good gradation characteristic
is intended to be obtained, fine particles (e.g., those having a particle size of not more than 5 µm) and coarse
particles (e.g., those having a particle size of not less than 20 µm) must be removed by classification. In such a case,
the resultant yield is greatly decreased.Further, in this pulverization process, it is difficult to uniformly disperse solid fine particles such as colorant, charge
controlling agent and anti-offset agent in the above-mentioned thermoplastic resin.
