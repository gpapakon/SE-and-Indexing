<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spacer (160) for a 
rotary peening apparatus having a hub (100) and a 

plurality of peening flaps (110) that are spaced about and 
retained by the generally cylindrical peripheral surface 

of the hub. Each peening flap includes several peening 
rivets (120) attached to a distal end of the peening flap. 

The spacer of the present invention positions the peening 
flaps at at least two locations inward of one of the hub 

ends of the hub, which enables the rotary peening 
apparatus to impart a uniform surface finish to a surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spacer for a
rotary peening apparatus.Conventional shot peening or blasting is often
used to treat concrete or metal surfaces by blowing or
mechanically impelling spherical particles of steel or
iron against the surface. For example, new concrete
surfaces often must cure for approximately thirty days,
after which the top layer of concrete is removed to
eliminate latents, residuals, and other undesirable
characteristics of the top layer of the concrete. When the
top layer is removed, a uniform surface is provided, which
allows for more effective application of coatings and the
like. Similarly, it is often desirable to remove existing
surface coatings, such as paint, prior to the application
of a new coating. Shot peening may be used for either of
these purposes, because the impact of the individual
particles tends to loosen and dislodge particles of
concrete and coating.For metal surfaces, the individual particles
produce shallow, rounded overlapping dimples in the
surface, stretching the surface radially from each point
of impact and causing cold working of the material. The
resultant compressive stresses tend to counteract tensile
stresses imparted to the workpiece by other processing
steps, such as rolling, bending, or abrading. Such
blasting or peening operations thus have wide
applicability in the field of surface treatment.Conventional shot peening, although useful for
some purposes, has certain disadvantages that tend to
limit its usefulness. For example, large and expensive
equipment is typically required for collecting, screening,
and recirculating the shot particles and impelling them
against the surface of the workpiece. Such blasting 
equipment typically is not portable, and thus may only be
used with those workpieces that can be brought to the
blasting equipment. Shot peening a workpiece while it is
attached to a piece of equipment is very difficult because
the particles cannot be easily collected. Shot peening a
surface such as a concrete highway is also quite
difficult, because the blasting equipment is not highly
mobile, and the particles are not easily collected for
recirculation.An alternative to shot peening processes
described above is the use of rotary peening devices such
as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,648,498 (Voss et
al.), 3,834,200 (Winter), and 3,857,750 (Winter et al.).
Rotary peening devices have been used in processes such as
the removal of residual stresses in metals, removal of
scale and coatings on metal surfaces, removal of
