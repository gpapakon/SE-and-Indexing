<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to resolve 
the noise problem with the ink in an ink jet head 

without changing the substrate manufacturing process 
for the ink jet head, that is, increasing the cost 

on the manufacture, and without needs of disposing 
a noise countermeasure component on the side of the 

printer main device, or making the design change for 
the countermeasure. The present invention is 

characterized in that to prevent malfunction from 
arising by the noise, a hysteresis circuit 101 to 

provide different input data threshold values upon 
rising and falling is provided on an input portion 

of the signal for a drive control logic system such 
as a drive input signal for a shift register 404 and 

a latch circuit 403 on the same substrate as that of 
the heating elements 401, the driver 402 and the drive 

control logic circuit, utilizing a diffusion layer 
constituting a driver 402.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
head substrate which is effective for stable printing
without causing malfunction against the noise, an ink
jet head using said substrate, and an ink jet printing
apparatus such as a printer using said head.An ink jet recording method (liquid jet recording
method) is extremely superior in that the noise produced
during operation is as little as to be ignorable, the
high speed printing is enabled, and the so-called plain
paper can be used for printing without need of a special
treatment of fixing, and has become a main stream of
the printing method.In particular, a liquid jet recording method
as described in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 54-51837 and Deutsche Offenlegungshrift
No. 2843064 has a distinct feature in a respect that
the motive force for discharging liquid droplets is
obtained by applying thermal energy to the liquid,
as opposed to other liquid jet recording methods, for
example, a method of discharging liquid droplets by
applying mechanical pressure. That is, the recording method as disclosed
in the above publications is characterized in that
the liquid subjected to heat energy causes a state
change with a rapid increase in volume to discharge
liquid droplets through orifices at the top end of
the ink jet head owing to action force based on said
state change, and attach them to the recording medium
to effect the recording.Specifically, the liquid jet recording method
as disclosed in Deutsche Offenlegungshrift No. 2843064
has the features that it is not only quite effectively
applicable to a so-called drop-on-demand recording
method, but also can provide the image with high
resolution and quality at high rate because the ink
jet head with a high density arrangement of discharge
orifices and of the full-line type can be easily
embodied.The ink jet head applied to the above recording
method comprises a liquid discharge portion having
discharge orifices provided to discharge the liquid
and liquid channels communicating to said discharge
orifices, each having as its part a heat acting portion
where heat energy for discharging liquid droplets is
applied to the liquid, the liquid discharge portion
being constituted of a head substrate (heater board)
having electricity-heat converters (heating elements)
as means for generating heat energy and a ceiling plate 
having grooves for forming discharge orifices and liquid
channels.In recent years, the head substrate has been
constructed in a manner not only to have a plurality
of heating
