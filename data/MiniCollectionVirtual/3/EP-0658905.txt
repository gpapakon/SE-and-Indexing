with a parallel circuit, connected between the

two poles (VDD, GND) of a voltage supply source, with a
first series circuit with a first EPROM transistor

(E1), a first MOS transistor (M1) and a first circuit
node (SK1) situated between them, and a second series

circuit with a second EPROM transistor (E2), a second
MOS transistor (M2) and a second circuit node (SK2),

the stored information being dependent on the switching
state given by the programming state of the EPROM transistors

(E1, E2), the gate of each of the two MOS transistors
(M1, M2) being connected to the circuit node

(SK1, SK2) of the respective other series circuit and
the circuit node (SK2) of one (E2, M2) of the two series

circuits (E1, M1, E2, M2) providing the output
signal of the memory circuit, 
characterised in that
the two EPROM transistors (E1, E2) are connected
to a programming device by means of which, depending

on the information to be stored, only the first
(E1) or the second (E2) EPROM transistor can ever be

brought into a programmed state and the respective
other EPROM transistor (E1, E2) can ever be brought

into an unprogrammed state;
the programming device has:

a first (PT1) and a second (PT2) programming
transistor, via which the side of the EPROM transistor

(E1, E2) of the first or the second series
circuit respectively facing the associated MOS

transistor (M1, M2) is connected to a programming
signal device (PS1, PS2), which, during the programming

process, applies a programming signal only
to a selectable one of the two EPROM transistors

(E1, E2) and no programming signal to the other,
and 
a programming control signal device (PROG),
which switches the two programming transistors

(PT1, PT2) to a conducting state during a programming
process;
in each of the two series circuits, a blocking
transistor (ST1, ST2) is connected between the circuit

nodes (SK1, SK2) and the connection point between the
EPROM transistor (E1, E2) and the programming transistor

(PT1, PT2), which, during a programming process,

programming control signal device (PROG) and at other
times to a conducting state;
at least one simulation transistor (SIT1,
SIT2) is connected in parallel or in series with each

of the two EPROM transistors (E1, E2), each of which
can optionally be switched to a conducting or a blocking

state for test simulation purposes by means of a
test signal associated with each;

source (REF), which has:

source with a first switching transistor (SW1)

partial-voltage take-off point (TA) and a series

voltage drop and a second circuit element with a
constant voltage drop in the form of a third EPROM

partial-voltage take-off point (TA) is sufficient

E2) to the conducting state but not the programmed
EPROM transistor (E1, E2),
a first controllable switch (TG2), which is
connected between the partial-voltage take-off

point (TA) and the output (REFOUT) of the reference
voltage source (REF) and which switches the partial

voltage present at the partial-voltage take-off
point (TA) through to the output (REFOUT) when

switched to the conducting state,
a programming reference voltage source
(VPROG) with a programming reference voltage of

sufficient magnitude to program an EPROM transistor
(E1, E2)
and a second controllable switch (TG3),
which is connected between the programming reference

voltage source (VPROG) and the output (REFOUT)
of the reference voltage source (REF) and which

switches the programming reference voltage through
to the output (REFOUT) when switched to the conducting

state,
