<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 1-[[(dialkylamino)alkyl]amino]-4-substituted-thioxanthen-9-ones,
to pharmaceutical compositions containing the
thioxanthenones, to methods of treating tumors with the
thioxanthenones and to methods of treating cancer in
mammals with the compositions containing the
thioxanthenones.Nabih and Elsheikh [J. Pharm. Sci. 54, 1672-1673
(1965)] disclose 1-[[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-4-[(diethylamino)methyl]thioxanthen-9-one.
No utility
was demonstrated for the compound.Collins and Rosi U.S. Patent 3,745,172 disclose as
an intermediate in the synthesis of antifungal and
antibacterial agents:

and as an anthelmintic and antibacterial agent:
Rosi and Peruzotti U. S. Patent 3,312,598 disclose
1-[[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-9-oxo-9H-thioxanthene-4-carboxylic
acid as a by-product of fermentation having
no disclosed utility.Blanz and French [J. Med. Chem. 6, 185-191 (1963)]
disclose the synthesis of a series of thioxanthenones
related to lucanthone and the results of the testing of 
the compounds against a leukemia and two solid tumors.
Among the compounds disclosed are

wherein R is methyl, methoxy, and ethoxy.Yarinsky and Freele [Journal of Tropical Medicine
and Hygiene 73, 23-27 (1970)] disclose

as an antischistosomal agent.Palmer et al. [J. Med. Chem. 31, 707-712 (1988)]
disclose N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-9-oxo-9H-thioxanthene-4-carboxamide
monohydrochloride which was
tested in vitro versus murine leukemia (L1210) and
in vivo versus P388 leukemia cells and was found to be
unlikely to be worth pursuing as a potential antitumor
agent. Archer, U.S. Patent 4,539,412 discloses compounds
of the formula:

wherein, for X=S:
R1 and R2 are individually selected from one of
lower-alkyls, and jointly selected from one of
pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl and
N-substituted piperazinyl; andR3 is H or hydroxy.
wherein, for X=O:
R1 and R2 are individually selected from one of
lower-alkyls, and jointly selected from one of
pyrrolidinyl, piperidyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl and
N-substituted piperazinyl; andR3 is hydroxy.
The compounds are said to be useful as antitumor agents.Archer et al. [J. Med. Chem. 31, 254-260 (1988)]
disclose compounds of the general formula:

wherein
R=C2H5, R'=H, R''=CH2OH (example 1);R=CH3, R'=OH, R''=CH2OH (example 2);R=C2H5, R'=H, R''=CH2OCONHCH3 (example 4);R=CH3, R'=OH, R''=CH2OCONHCH3 (example 5); R=C2H5, R'=H, R"=CH2OCONHC6H5 (example 23);R=C2H5; R'=H, R"=CH2OCONHC3H7 (example 24);R=C2H5, R'=H, R"=CH2OCONHC4H9 (example 25);R=C2H5, R'=H,
