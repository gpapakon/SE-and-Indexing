<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soldering contact consisting of a stamped sheet-metal part having a housing with housing walls, and having a contact point, which is arranged in a moving manner and is bounded by two contact spring arms, for making contact with a contact pin, the housing having at least one soldering leg which can be inserted through a hole into a printed circuit board, and the contact spring arms which bound the contact point being linked by means of a curved spring arm web to one of the housing walls, and the curved spring arm web extending freely into the housing in the form of an arc, so that the contact point, which is bounded by the contact spring arms, is arranged such that it can move in the insertion axis direction of a contact pin and/or transversely with respect thereto.

movably arranged contact point (35) delimited by two contact
spring arms (33, 34) for contacting a contact pin, the housing

having at least one soldering leg (16) which can be inserted
through a hole in a printed circuit board, characterized in that

the contact spring arms (33, 34) which delimit the contact point
(35) are connected by means of an arcuate spring arm web (23) to

one of the housing walls (1, 2, 3) and the arcuate spring arm web
(23) extends freely into the housing in the form of an arc, with

the result that the contact point (35) which is delimited by the
contact spring arms (33, 34) is freely movable relative to the

housing.
A soldering contact according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the arcuate spring arm web (23) is constructed in the form

of a strip.
A soldering contact according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the arcuate spring arm web (23) is formed by two thin

arcuate loops (23a, 23b).
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the arcuate spring arm web (23) is

constructed in the form of a meander.
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that the direction of the insertion axis of

the contact insertion pin is transverse with respect to the
longitudinal direction of the soldering contact.
A soldering contact according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the direction of the insertion axis of the contact pin runs

parallel to the direction of the insertion axis of the soldering 
leg (16).
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that there are formed in the housing wall (1,

2), to which the arcuate spring arm web (23) is connected,
incisions (24, 25) by which the arcuate spring arm web (23) is

elongated.
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that the arcuate spring arm web (23) extends

from the housing wall (1, 2), to which it is connected, in a
semi-circular arc into the housing of the soldering contact.
A soldering contact according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the semi-circular arc is adjoined by a linearly running

region (27) of the arcuate spring arm web (23) to which a U-shaped
spring arm base (28) is connected in one piece, said

spring arm base (28) having two straight U-shaped limbs (30, 31)
to each of which there is connected one of the contact spring

arms (33, 34), the spring arm base (18) being arranged between
the arcuate spring arm web (23) and the contact spring arms (33,

34).
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
9, characterized in that the movability of the spring arms (33,

34) or the contact point (35) is limited by stop tabs (8, 21)
fixed to the housing or by a stop tab (8) fixed to the housing

and a web (55) fixed to the housing, which in each case are
arranged opposite each other in the direction of the insertion

axis of the contact insertion pin and run transversely with
respect to the spring arms (33, 34).
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
10, characterized in that the housing has a U-shaped cross

section with a covering wall (3) and two mutually opposite
lateral walls (1, 2) to which there are connected soldering legs

(16) at their free lower edges (14, 15), which preferably lie in 
the planes of the lateral walls (1, 2), the arcuate spring arm

web (23) being connected to a lateral wall (1, 2).
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
11, characterized in that the contact spring arms (33, 34) are

formed from contact regions (40, 41) which run transversely with
respect to the direction of the insertion axis of the contact pin

and to which there are connected in the direction of the
insertion axis tabs (40a, 41a) which are bent outwards, with the

result that they form a locating funnel for the contact pin.
A soldering contact according to one or more of Claims 1 to
12, characterized in that there is connected to one of the

contact spring arms (33, 34) an arcuate spring web (44) which
extends from the side opposite the spring arm base in an arc

around the corresponding end of the opposite contact spring arm
(33, 34) with the result that the arcuate spring web (44)
