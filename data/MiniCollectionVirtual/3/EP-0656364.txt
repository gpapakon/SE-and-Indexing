<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is the compounds of formula (I): 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which:     - either A and B each represent a hydrogen atom,   - or A represents a hydrogen atom and B an OH radical,   - or A and B together form a carbon-carbon double bond, - and Z represents a hydrogen atom or the residue of a carboxylic acid.   The compounds of formula (I) have valuable antibiotic properties.

<CLAIMS>
The compounds of formula (I): 

 
in which: 


either A represents a hydrogen atom and B an OH radical, 
or A and B form together a carbon-carbon double bond, 
 
and Z represents a hydrogen atom or the remainder of a 

carboxylic acid. 
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 in 
which Z represents a hydrogen atom. 
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 or 2 
in which A and B form together a carbon-carbon double bond. 
3-de((2,6-dideoxy 3-C-methyl 3-O-methyl alpha-L-ribohexopyranosyl) 
oxy) 9-deoxo 9,10-didehydro 11,12-dideoxy-3,11-dioxo 

9,12-epoxy 6-O-methyl erythromycin. 
Preparation process for the compounds of formula (I), 
characterized in that a compound of formula (II):  

 

 
in which Z' represents the remainder of a carboxylic acid, is 

subjected to the action of an agent capable of introducing an 
epoxide bridge in position 9(12) and of simultaneously 

oxidizing the hydroxy function in position 11, in order to 
obtain the compound of formula (I
A
): 

 
which is subjected if desired: 


either to the action of a releasing agent of the hydroxyl 
function in position 2' in order to obtain the compound (I
B
):  
 


or to the action of a dehydration agent in order to obtain 
the compound of formula (I
C
): 

 
then if desired the compound of formula (I
C
) is subjected to 
the action of a releasing agent of the hydroxyl function in 

position 2' in order to obtain the compound of formula (I
D
):  
 


 
which is subjected if desired to the action of a releasing 

agent of the hydroxyl function in position 2' in order to 
obtain the compound of formula (I
F
)): 

As medicaments, the compounds of formula (I) as defined 
in any one of claims 1 to 3. 
As a medicament, the compound of claim 4. 
The pharmaceutical compositions containing as active 
ingredient at least one medicament defined in claim 6 or 7.
