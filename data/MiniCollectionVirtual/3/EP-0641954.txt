<ABSTRACT>
A rubber vibration isolator with a bracket (10) and a method of 
manufacturing the same. An elastic rubber member (22) is 

vulcanization bonded to both a metallic cylindrical portion (11) and 
an inner sleeve (21) disposed inside of the cylindrical portion in a 

first securing portion (22a,22b) opposed to an inner surface of the 
metallic cylindrical portion (11) and a second securing portion (25) 

opposed to an outer surface of the inner sleeve (21). Next, the 
metallic cylindrical portion (11) is plastically deformed towards an 

axial center thereof to precompress the elastic rubber member (22). 
An arm portion (12) is secured to an outer surface of the 

plastically deformed cylindrical portion (11) by low temperature 
welding, thereby forming the bracket (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber vibration
isolator provided with a bracket, especially to a bracket according to
the preamble of the patent claim 1,
and methods of manufacturing the same.One example of a conventional cylindrical engine mount
needing a bracket is illustrated in FIGS. 10 through 14 which represent
the closest prior art to the invention and which show a bracket known from
JP-57-94 146 in a simplified structure.In order to manufacture the above-described conventional
engine mount, as shown in FIGS. 10 to 12, a cylindrical rubber
vibration isolator 50 composed of an inner sleeve 51, an outer
sleeve 52 and an elastic rubber member 53 bonded to the inner
sleeve 51 and the outer sleeve 52 by vulcanization is first
formed by using a mold, and then, the durability of the elastic
rubber member 53 is improved by drawing the cylindrical rubber
vibration isolator 50 from the outside of the outer sleeve 52.
Upon drawing, the outer sleeve 52 is plastically deformed to
reduce the diameter thereof, thereby precompressing the elastic 
rubber member 53. Thus, as shown in FIGS. 12, a drawn
cylindrical rubber vibration isolator 50' is prepared.As shown in FIG. 13, a bracket 60 made of steel is also
prepared by integrally securing an arm portion 62 to a
cylindrical portion 61 in an arc-shaped portion 63 by spot
welding, arc welding or other electrically welding method.By press-fitting the drawn cylindrical rubber vibration
isolator 50' in the cylindrical portion 61 of the thus prepared
bracket 60, the engine mount provided with a bracket (FIG. 14)
is obtained.This conventional rubber vibration isolator with a
bracket, however, has problems that the outer sleeve 52 is
needed as an essential component and that the process of press-fitting
the drawn cylindrical rubber vibration isolator 50' in
the cylindrical portion 61 of the bracket 60 is also needed. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a bracket with a rubber vibration isolator, which does
not need any outer sleeve, and an improved method of
manufacturing such a bracket without the
press-fitting process of the cylindrical rubber vibration
isolator in the hollow cylindrical portion of the bracket.This object is solved by a bracket having the technical
features according to the enclosed patent claim 1 and by methods
according to the patent claims 4 and 7, respectively. According to claim 8, welding the cylindrical portion and the arm portion is
carried out by resistance welding. In order to prevent the
degradation of the

<CLAIMS>
A bracket (10) comprising a hollow cylindrical
portion (11) made of a metallic material and a metallic

arm portion (12) extending from a single side of said
cylindrical portion (11) and integrally secured to an

outer surface of said cylindrical portion (11) by welding,
wherein

   said cylindrical portion (11) forms an aperture
accommodating a rubber vibration isolator composed of an

inner sleeve (21) disposed inside an outer sleeve so as to
face said outer sleeve with an annular space and an

elastic rubber member (22) disposed in said annular space,
said elastic rubber member (22) having a first securing

portion (22a, 22b) bonded to an inner surface of said
outer sleeve by vulcanization and a second securing

portion (25) integrally bonded to an outer surface of said
inner sleeve (21) by vulcanization and being in the

precompressed state towards an axial center of said outer
sleeve,
characterized in that

said hollow cylindrical portion (11) of said bracket (10)
forms said outer sleeve wherein said first securing

portion (22a, 22b) of the elastic rubber member (22) is
