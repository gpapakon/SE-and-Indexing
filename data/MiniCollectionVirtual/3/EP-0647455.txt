<ABSTRACT>
A pacemaker is provided having an improved circuit 
for obtaining a measure of battery end-of-life. The EOL 

detector includes an input stage with a current mirror output 
providing a current which is proportional to the current 

being consumed by the pacemaker circuitry, and thus being 
expended by the battery. The proportional current is 

directed to charge a capacitor, which is periodically 
discharged at a constant current, following which the battery 

goes through repeated cycles of charging and discharging. A 
measuring circuit measures the time of capacitor discharge, 

thereby providing a measure of battery energy discharge 
during the interval that the capacitor was charging. The 

interval counts are accumulated to provide an overall count 
representative of battery expenditure, and thus of pacemaker 

EOL.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cardiac pacemakers
and, more particularly, to cardiac pacemakers with the
facility to continuously detect a measure of battery
expenditure so as to predict nominal pacemaker end-of-life
(EOL).In the area of implantable cardiac pacemakers, it
has long been recognized that it is important to have the
capacity to determine a measure of the effective remaining
lifetime of the implanted pacemaker. Although great
improvements have been made in the batteries that are used in
pacemakers, extending significantly the available lifetime of
pacemakers, there remains a need to have accurate information
from which to predict EOL. As used herein, and as is common
in the pacemaker art, end-of-life refers to a time when the
battery has been drained sufficiently that the pacemaker
should be replaced. Thus, EOL generally does not refer to a
time when a pacemaker actually ceases to operate effectively,
but a time by which the pacemaker should be replaced while
there is still a sufficient factor of safety. Thus, e.g.,
the pacemaker manufacturer may recommend a replacement of the
pacemaker at a time when it actually has an estimated three
months of lifetime remaining, to guarantee that replacement
takes place before there is a significant danger of actual
cessation of pacemaker operation.An early technique for EOL detection in pacemakers
was founded upon the characteristics of the battery 
impedance. Based upon the observation that battery internal
impedance was substantially constant throughout most of the
battery lifetime, and then began to increase as battery
exhaustion approached, the standard technique utilized was to
isolate the battery from the pacemaker briefly in order to
get an internal impedance measurement. See, for example,
U.S. Patent 5,317,021, assigned to Medtronic, Inc. However,
in the latest generation of batteries utilized in implantable
pacemakers, the impedance change occurs too quickly to
provide sufficient warning, and cannot be reliably detected
safely in advance of effective battery exhaustion.
Consequently, another engineering approach to the matter is
required.The more recent solution to the problem of
measuring EOL in the pacemaker art is based on the fact that
the battery energy at start-of-life is accurately known. The
pacemaker is provided with a circuit for obtaining a measure
of total, or integrated battery current expenditure, and
determining from this measure what percentage of battery
energy has been depleted. By making it possible for a
physician to
