<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pyrimidine derivatives or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which possess an excellent
anti-secretory activity, pharmaceutical compositions containing same as an active
ingredient, their novel intermediates, and processes for the preparation thereof.For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, various drugs such as antacid,
anticholinergic agent, H2-receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitor have
been used. The advent of omeprazole useful as a proton pump inhibitor has
rekindled research activities in this field.However, it has been pointed out that the proton pump inhibition by
omeprazole is irreversible, which may induce side effects. Accordingly, various
attempts to develop a reversible proton pump inhibitor are being actively made.
For example, European Patent Nos. 322133 and 404322 disclose quinazoline
derivatives, European Patent No. 259174 describes quinoline derivatives, and
WO 91/18887 offers pyrimidine derivatives, as a reversible proton pump
inhibitor. Further, the present inventors have also reported quinazoline
derivatives in WO 94/14795 and pyrimidine derivatives in WO 96/05177.The present inventors have carried out extensive research to develop a
reversible proton pump inhibitor with improved efficacy, and as a result have
discovered that pyrimidine derivatives having a substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline
group at 4-position of the pyrimidine nucleus or substituents at the 2-, 5-, or 
6-position of the pyrimidine nucleus exhibit excellent proton pump inhibition
effects and possess the ability to attain a reversible proton pump inhibition.Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide
novel pyrimidine derivatives having a substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline group at
4-position of the pyrimidine nucleus or substituents at the 2-, 5-, or 6-position
of the pyrimidine nucleus, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.It is a further object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical
compositions for treating peptic ulcer containing the same as active ingredients.Accordingly, the present invention provides a pyrimidine derivative of the following
formula (I):

wherein
B is C3-C7 cycloalkyl; C1-C3 alkoxyethyl; 1-naphthylmethyl, 4-methylthiazol-2-yl or
4-phenylthiazol-2-yl or a group of formula (II): 

(wherein R6 is hydrogen, methyl, hydroxy, methoxy, or a group of formula (III):

wherein Z is C1-C4 alkyl; C2-C4 alkenyl; C3-C6 cycloalkyl;
morpholinomethyl; piperidinomethyl; phenyl; naphthyl; thiophen-2-yl-methyl;
or
