<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compounds of the formula 
 
in which: 
X is a nitrogen atom or a group of the formula CH (Ia); R1 is C1-C4alkyl; and either R2 and R3 independently of one another are hydrogen, C1-C4alkyl, halo-C1-C4alkyl, 
C1-C4alkoxy, C1-C4alkoxymethyl, C1-C4alkylthio, C1-C4alkylthiomethyl, an unsubstituted 
or substituted aryl, heteroaryl, aryl-C1-C4alkyl, heteroaryl-C1-C4alkyl, 
aryloxy-C1-C4alkyl, heteroaryloxy-C1-C4alkyl, arylthio-C1-C4alkyl, 
heteroarylthio-C1-C4alkyl, arylcarbonyl or heteroarylcarbonyl group, C2-C4alkenyl, an 
unsubstituted or substituted aryl-C2-C4alkenyl or heteroaryl-C2-C4alkenyl group, 
C2-C4alkynyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl or cyano, or R2 and R3 together with the carbon atom to which R2 and R3 are attached are an 
unsubstituted or substituted saturated or unsaturated, carbo- or heterocyclic 4- to 
7-membered ring to which an unsubstituted or substituted benzene ring may be fused; 
in free form or, if appropriate, in salt form, to a process for the preparation and to the use 
of these compounds, and to pesticides whose active ingredient is selected from amongst 
these compounds, in free form or, if appropriate, in salt form, and to a process for the 
preparation and to the use of these compositions. Some of the compounds I can exist in the form of salts. This is because they form acid 
addition salts when they have at least one basic centre. These acid addition salts are 
formed for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, for example 
sulfuric acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids  
 
such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halogen-substituted, 
C1-C4alkanecarboxylic acids, for example acetic acids, such as optionally unsaturated 
dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid or 
phthalic acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic acid, lactic acid, 
malic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid, or such as benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic 
acids such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halogen-substituted, C1-C4alkane- 
or arylsulfonic acids, for example methane- or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Agrochemically 
advantageous salts are preferred within the scope of the invention; but it also embraces 
salts which are disadvantageous for agrochemical purposes, for example salts which are 
toxic to bees or fish, and which are employed, for example, for isolating or purifying free 
compounds I or, if appropriate, agrochemically advantageous salts
