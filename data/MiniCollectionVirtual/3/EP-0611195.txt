<ABSTRACT>
A rudder assembly for a boat in which a rapid pivotal 
displacement of the tiller from a first position to a second position 

displaces the rudder into either a raised or a lowered position, and which 
comprises a biased locking means for releasably retaining said tiller in a 

first position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rudder assembly for a 
boat, in particular light sailing or motor boats, and in particular to such 
an assembly provided with means for raising and lowering the rudder out 
of and into a steering position. Rudder assemblies for boats must clearly be provided with 
means whereby the rudder can be readily raised or lowered out of or into 
its steering position. Thus, when the boat is being pushed into the water 
the rudder must clearly be raised, and in the water the rudder should be 
readily lowered into a steering position. Similarly, when approaching the 
shore it must be possible readily to raise the rudder and this possibility 
must also be readily available when the boat is in the vicinity of reefs or 
other objects which project from or are close to the water line. Various proposals have been made and many have been put 
into practice for displacing the rudder into and out of its steering 
position, but these are all characterized by being relatively time 
consuming in operation with the consequent danger that, in an emergency 
such as, for example, when the boat is approaching a reef or other  
 
obstacle, it is not possible to quickly raise the rudder out of its exposed 
lowered position and, in consequence, the rudder and even the boat may 
be damaged. These problems arise even more acutely with catamarans, 
wherein each hull is provided with a separate rudder assembly and speed 
of operation in raising and lowering the rudder is even more essential. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and 
improved rudder assembly for a boat, wherein the above-referred-to 
disadvantages are significantly reduced. FR-A-2 372 078 discloses a retractable rudder for small 
boat, which may be raised clear of water by upwards movement of 
a tiller. The rudder is fitted into a hollow yoke by a horizontal 
pivot pin. The yoke is carried on a pintle mounted on the 
stern-post. The tiller is also mounted onto the yoke and fixed 
by the pivot point. The tiller and rudder blade are connected by 
the link fixed at each end to the tiller and rudder. An upwards 
movement of the tiller causes the rudder blade to move upwards 
until it makes an angle of 30 deg. above the horizontal when the 
tiller is vertical. According to the present invention there is provided a 
rudder assembly for a boat comprising: 
a rudder support bracket for mounting on the boat so as to be 
pivotable about a rudder steering axis; a rudder coupled to said bracket so as to be pivotable with

<CLAIMS>
A rudder assembly for a boat, comprising : 

a rudder support bracket (1) for mounting on the boat (4) so as to be 
pivotable about a rudder steering axis (2); 
a rudder (5) coupled to said bracket (1) so as to be pivotable with 
respect thereto about a first axis (6) substantially normal to said steering 

axis (2) and to a longitudinal axis of the boat (4); 
a tiller (7) coupled at a first end (7a) thereof to said bracket (1) so 
as to be pivotable with respect thereto about a second axis (8) substantially 

parallel to said first axis (6); and 
a coupling rod (9) coupled at a first end thereof to said tiller (7) so 
as to be pivotable with respect thereto about a third axis (10) adjacent 

and parallel to said second axis (8), and coupled at a second and opposite 

end thereof to said rudder (5) so as to be pivotable with respect thereto 
about a fourth axis (11) adjacent and parallel to said first axis;
 
   characterized in that the rudder assembly is 

arranged so that a rapid pivotal displacement of the tiller (7) 
from a first position to a second position displaces the coupling rod (9) 

from a first condition wherein said first, third and fourth axes (6, 10, 11) 
are non-aligned through a dead center condition wherein said axes are 

aligned and into either of two maximally displaced conditions wherein 
said axes are non-aligned and said rudder (5) is displaced into either a 

raised or a lowered position, and wherein the tiller (7) may be returned 
to its first position. 
A rudder assembly according to Claim 1, wherein it 
further comprises a spring biased locking means mounted on said 

bracket (1) for releasably retaining said tiller (7) in a first position. 
A rudder assembly according to Claim 2, wherein said locking 
means comprises a locking bar (12) formed at one end with a locking 

hook (13) and at an opposite end with a crescent-shaped recess (14), said 
locking bar (12) being pivotally mounted at an intermediate position  

 
thereof on said bracket (1), there being furthermore provided a projecting 

abutment (16) integral with said bracket (1) and projecting through said 
recess (14), and spring biasing means (17) located within said crescent-shaped 

recess (14) for biasing said locking bar in an anti-clockwise 
direction. 
A rudder assembly according to Claim 2, wherein said locking 
means comprises a locking member (20) formed at a top end with a 

locking recess (21) and being pivotally mounted on said bracket (1), there 
being provided a resilient abutting member (27) for biassing said locking 

member in a clockwise direction, there being furthermore provided an 
adjustment screw (23) for limiting the angular displacement of the 

locking member (20). 
A rudder assembly according to Claim 1, wherein said tiller is 
elongate and has a longitudinal axis substantially perpendicular to said 

second and third axis, and the movement of said tiller from said first 
position to said second position does not entail any movement of said 

tiller along said longitudinal axis.
