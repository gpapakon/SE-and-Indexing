<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a new protein, designated Rib, and subfragments, multiples or variants thereof, which confers protective immunity against infection with many group B streptococcal strains, in particular those of serotype III. The invention includes a procedure for purification of the protein, a procedure for preparation of highly specific antibodies, a reagent kit, a DNA sequence encoding the protein and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the protein or fragments or variants thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel protein designated Rib (and subfragments, variants
and multiples thereof) which confers immunity to most invasive strains of the group B
Streptococcus, a procedure for purification of the protein, antibodies specific to the protein, a
reagent kit and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the protein or fragments thereof.During the last three decades, the group B Streptococcus has emerged as a major
cause of neonatal disease in the Western world. In the United States alone, there are about
10,000 cases per year of invasive disease caused by this bacterium. These infections have an
overall mortality of about 20%, and many of the infants that survive have permanent
neurological sequelae. In view of these findings, a large effort has been made to find methods
of prevention and treatment and to analyze the mechanisms by which group B streptococci
cause infections.About 20 % of all women are vaginal carriers of the group B Streptococcus, and
vertical transmission from the maternal genital tract is probably the most common source of
infection in neonatal disease caused by this bacterium. However, only 1 to 2 % of the infants
that are colonized by the group B Streptococcus at birth are afflicted by serious infection. Other
factors than exposure to the bacterium during birth must therefore contribute to the
development of neonatal disease. Mothers of infected infants have significantly lower levels of
antibodies to the type III capsule, which implies that these antibodies are important for
protection against neonatal disease ( Baker,C.J. and D.L. Kasper, N. Engl. J. Med. 1976,
294:753).Group B streptococcal strains are divided into four major serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, and III)
based on the structure of the polysaccharide capsule (Baker, J Inf Dis 1990. 161: 917).
Serotypes I, II, and III occur in roughly equal proportions among strains in the normal flora,
but type III accounts for about two-thirds of all isolates from invasive infections. Since the
capsule is a known virulence factor, it has been studied in considerable detail, in particular in
type III strains. Efforts have been made to develop a vaccine, in which the type III
polysaccharide capsule would be an essential component. However, use of the polysaccharide 
capsule as a vaccine may give problems due to crossreactions with human tissues (Pritchard et
al., Infect Immun 1992. 60: 1598). It would therefore be very valuable if one could develop a
vaccine based on proteins rather than on polysaccharides.The group B
