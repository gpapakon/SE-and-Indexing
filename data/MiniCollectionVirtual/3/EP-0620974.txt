<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a frozen dough which does not need 
to be thawed and proofed prior to baking, which includes a 

specific leavening system consisting of sodium or potassium 
hydrogencarbonate and a leavening acid wherein sodium or 

potassium hydrogencarbonate is present in the amount of 
from 3.2% to 3.7% and the leavening acid is present in such 

an amount as to completely neutralize the 
hydrogencarbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a frozen dough and processes of 
preparing baked products from the frozen dough. A great variety of frozen dough products have been offered 
to a consumer in order to minimize the time and the effort 
of baking the products from "scratch" and to provide the 
convenience of extended storage time. Commercially 
available frozen dough products must be "proofed" prior to 
baking. "Proofing" is the time required for yeast in a 
dough to produce sufficient amount of carbon dioxide gas to 
give correct height, volume, and structure in a baked 
product. Generally, an end user of a frozen dough product 
is inconvenienced by the need to thaw and proof the product 
prior to baking. The time required for thawing and proofing 
is at least 2-4 hours. Use of chemical leavening agents in place of yeast obviates 
the need for proofing,but it detracts from the texture, 
flavor, and structure associated with proofed dough 
products. An illustrative example is provided by a 
comparison of a biscuit or Irish soda bread (chemically 
leavened; unproofed) with a bread loaf, a dinner roll, or a 
bread stick (yeast leavened; proofed). Proofed products are 
lighter, less dense, less chewy, more porous, more aerated 
than chemically leavened unproofed products. With regard to 
flavor and aroma, it has been found as part of the present 
invention that mere addition of a yeast flavor compound to 
a chemically leavened product does not attain the flavor 
and aroma of a proofed product.  In some processes described in the art, proofing is carried 
out (at least to some extent) by a manufacturer of frozen 
dough products, prior to freezing, so as to minimize or 
eliminate the need for proofing by the end user. See for 
example U.S. Patents 4,847,104 and 4,966,778 to Benjamin et 
al. The resultant dough is termed "pre-proofed" frozen 
dough. A serious drawback of these processes is that they 
call for special expensive ingredients, e.g. flour 
containing more than 16% protein. Even more importantly, 
such processes, at best, shift the burden of proofing from 
the end user to the manufacturer, increasing production 
time and cost and, ultimately, increasing cost to 
consumer. A frozen dough is desirable which does not need 
to be proofed by either the end user prior to baking or by 
the manufacturer prior to freezing, yet when baked is 
substantially similar to a proofed product in texture, 
flavor, structure, and aroma. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
produce a frozen dough product
