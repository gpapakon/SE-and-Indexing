<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to master discs for producing dies, particularly for optical discs, and to their methods of manufacture as well as to the dies obtained from these master discs and the optical discs obtained from these master discs and from these dies. The master discs according to the invention consist of a support carrying on its surface a succession of micropits which represent the information to be duplicated and consist of a hard, conducting material which reflects in the near infrared and is chosen from a nitride or a carbonitride of zirconium, of hafnium or of titanium, a hard ceramic which reflects in the near infrared and conducts only at the surface, and a hard glass which reflects in the near infrared and conducts only at the surface. These master discs find application in the field of information archiving and in the field of the manufacture of dies, especially for optical discs.

Master disc for making a die in particular for pressing optical discs, of
the type consisting of a support (1) carrying at its surface a series of

micropits representative of the information to be duplicated,
characterized in that the said series of micropits consists of a hard

material (9) reflecting in the near infrared and being conductive,
selected among a nitride or a carbonitride of zirconium, of hafnium or of

titanium, a hard ceramic reflecting in the near infrared and being
conducting at the surface only and a hard glass reflecting in the near

infrared and being conductive at the surface only and in that the said
master disc consists at most of two materials.
Master disc according to claim 1, characterized in that the support (1) is
of aluminium.
Master disc according to claim 1, characterized in that the support (1) is
of tempered and/or dealkalinized glass.
Master disc according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized
in that the said series of micropits is formed at the surface only of the

said material (9).
Master disc according to claim 1, characterized in that the support (1)
consists of the same material (9) as the series of micropits.
Master disc according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized
in that the material (9) is titanium nitride.
Master disc according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized
in that the depth of the micropits is comprised between about 500 and

about 2,000 Ã…, the total thickness of the master disc is comprised 
between about 1 and about 5 mm and in that the diameter of the master

disc is comprised between about 150 mm and about 200 mm.
Method of manufacture of a master disc according to claim 2 or claim 3,
the method comprising the successive steps of:


depositing a layer of material (9) upon a support (1);
depositing a layer of photosensitive resin (2) upon the layer of
material (9);
recording the information to be duplicated into the layer of
photosensitive resin (2) as a latent image by the travel of a light beam

(3) modulated in accordance with the signal to be recorded ;
removing the insolated zones (4) of photosensitive resin, this removal
leading to the creation of a series of micropits (6) in the said layer of

photosensitive resin ;
transferring the information into the layer of material (9), this transfer
leading to the creation of a series of micropits (7) in the layer of material

(9); and
removing the zones (5) of residual resin after this transfer.
Method of manufacture of a master disc according to claim 5, the
method comprising the successive steps of:


depositing a layer of photosensitive resin (2) upon a support (1)
consisting of the material (9);
recording the information to be duplicated into the layer of
photosensitive resin (2) as a latent image by the travel of a light beam

(3) modulated in accordance with the signal to be recorded ;
removing the insolated zones (4) of resin, this removal resulting in the
creation of a series of micropits (6) in the layer of photosensitive resin

(2);
transferring the information into the support (1), this transfer resulting in
the creation of micropits (7) in the substrate (1); and
removing the zones (4) of residual photosensitive resin.
Method of manufacture of a master disc according to claim 4, the
method comprising the successive steps of:


depositing a layer (2) of photosensitive resin upon a support (1);
recording the information to be duplicated as a latent image into the layer
of photosensitive resin (2) by the travel of a light beam (3) modulated in

accordance with the information to be recorded ;
removing the photosensitive resin in the insolated zones (4) , this
removal leading to the creation of a series of micropits (6) in the layer

(2);
transferring the information into the support (1), this transfer leading to
the creation of micropits (7) in the substrate (1);
removing the zones (5) of residual resin ; and
depositing a layer of material (9) upon the surface of the support (1)
comprising the series of micropits.
Method according to any one of claims 8 to 10, characterized in that the
material (9) is titanium nitride.
Method according to any one of claims 8 to 11, characterized in that the
light beam (3) is a laser beam, the removal of the photosensitive

substance (2) is carried out by chemical etching or by oxygen plasma
attack and in that the transfer of the information is effected by a process

of chemical engraving or by a process of engraving with a reactive
plasma.
Utilization of the master disc according to any one of claims 1 to 7

and/or obtained with the method according to one of claims 8 to 12 for
the manufacture of a die for pressing optical discs.
