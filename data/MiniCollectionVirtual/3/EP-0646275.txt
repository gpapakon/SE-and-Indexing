<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method in connection with a process for insulating or sheathing conductors or the like, wherein plastic material is extruded into at least one layer on the surface of the conductor (1), and the conductor coated with the plastic material (2, 3, 4) is cooled in a predetermined manner. To avoid problems caused by the shrinking of the plastic material, after the cooling of the conductor (1) and the plastic material in vicinity to it to a predetermined level in the insulating or sheathing process, the surface layer of the plastic material and the plastic material portions in vicinity to it are reheated to a predetermined temperature in a pressurized space filled with a medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method in which plastic 
material is extruded into at least one layer on the surface 
of a conductor or the like, and the conductor or the like 
coated with the plastic material is cooled in a 
predetermined manner in connection with an insulating or 
sheathing process. In the production of cables, there occurs problems 
due to the large change of the specific volume of plastics 
materials, such as polyethylene, on transition from the 
melting point to the room temperature. This is because the 
large change of the specific volume causes a 
disadvantageous shrinking phenomenon to occur in the cable, 
which tends to shorten the plastic layer around the 
conductors, thus causing problems in cable extensions and 
terminals. The shrinking effect has previously been 
reduced by applying a heat treatment to the finished cable 
or conductor wound on a reel. A problem therewith is, 
however, that as the stresses are released, when the cable 
is bent around the reel, further stress states are created 
in the plastic material when the cable is straightened. 
The heat treatment of the cable wound on a reel also 
requires plenty of time, at least 2 to 3 days, as well as 
plenty of energy. DE-A-2444952 discloses a method of sheathing 
conductors in which cross-linkable plastics material 
(polyethylene) is extruded onto the conductor which is 
cooled and afterwards heated again. The object of the invention is to provide a method 
by means of which the disadvantages of the prior art can be 
eliminated.  
 According to the invention, there is provided a 
method in connection with a process for insulating or 
sheathing conductors or the like, wherein cross-linkable 
plastic material is extruded into at least one layer on the 
surface of the conductor, and in which method the conductor 
coated with the cross-linkable plastic material is cooled 
in a predetermined manner, and subsequently heated again, 
characterised in that during said step of cooling the 
coated conductor, the cooling is such that the conductor 
and the cross-linkable plastic material in the vicinity of 
it is cooled substantially to the melting point of the 
cross-linkable plastic material and after said cooling step 
only the surface layer of the cross-linkable plastic 
material and the cross-linkable plastic material portion in 
the vicinity of the surface layer are reheated 
substantially to the melting point of the cross-linkable 
plastic material in a pressurized space filled with gas.  
 An advantage of the invention is
