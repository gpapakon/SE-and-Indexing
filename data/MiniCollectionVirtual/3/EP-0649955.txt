<ABSTRACT>
A reversible mount lock (10) of unitary 
construction, adapted to be inserted and held in a seat 

(31) on a structure (30) to be locked and having a body 
(11) which accommodates a lock (10) operating mechanism 

(13) and a latch (16) connected to said mechanism (13), 
is provided with elastic hooking members (18) adapted 

to engage in said seat (31) which enable the lock (10) 
to be assembled/disassembled to/from the structure (30) 

in a rapid basic manner with no need for additional 
elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reversible mount
lock of unitary construction.Known are unitary construction locks having a
body which accommodates a cylinder, adapted to be
rotated by means of a key, and having a latch attached
to the cylinder. The latch may be a tab-like retaining
member.Such locks are mounted in a reversible
fashion inside a seat provided in a member of a
structure to be locked. The locks may be assembled, for
instance, to mail boxes by fitting and securing them in
a window purposely cut in the box door.For example, to permit of reverse mounting, a
known approach provides one end of the lock body with a
threadway on which a nut can be received. The body with
the threaded end is inserted into the seat in the
structure member from the outward side of the member,
and the nut is then engaged on the threaded end from
the inward side of the member, thereby binding the lock
to the member. Of course, the reverse procedure would
enable the lock to be released and removed.Another known approach provides for opposite
walls of the body to be formed with a number of grooves
each, and a forked clevis engaged with its prongs in 
two opposite ones of the grooves. For mounting, the
lock body is inserted into the seat in the structure
member from the outward side of the member similar to
the previous case, whereafter the forked clevis is
applied to the body from the inward side of the member
such that its prongs will engage in opposite ones of
the grooves, thereby binding the lock to the member. Of
course, also in this case the reverse procedure would
enable the lock to be released and removed.In either cases, the mounting procedure
requires significant time, for tightening the nut or
fitting the clevis, which is obviously disadvantageous,
especially to mass production methods for which
assembly time is a factor.In addition, the lock assembly and
disassembly involves application of some skill, which
is also disadvantageous in that such operations cannot
be carried out literally by anybody.Lastly, a separate element is required, in
the one case the nut and in the other the clevis, to
complete the lock mounting. The separate element
involves additional cost, as well as some possible
difficulties in the lock manufacturing process.It is the object of this invention to obviate
such drawbacks. From the prior patent documents DE-U-9110347,
GB-A-2077344, and BE-A-883121 a lock is known, adapted
to be inserted and secured in a removable manner in a
seat provided on a structure to be locked, which
comprises a body
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lock (10) of unitary construction, adapted to
be inserted and secured in a removable manner in a seat

(31) provided on a structure (30) to be locked,
comprising a body (11) accommodating a lock operating

mechanism (13) and a latch (16) connected to said
mechanism (13), wings (18) being arranged on opposite

sides of the body (11) and connected thereto in an
elastically yielding fashion for engagement in the seat

(31), characterized in that the body (11) includes a
front plate (12) and the wings (18) extend rearwardly

from the front plate (12) along the body in the lock's
longitudinal direction, and in that each wing (18)

comprises an initial section (19) divergent from the
body (11) and serrated outwardly, and an end section

(20) convergent toward the body (11), said initial
section (19) of the wing (18) being adapted to engage

elastically an edge (32) of the seat (31) in said
structure (30).
A lock according to Claim 1, wherein two wings
(18) are provided on each of the opposite sides of the

body (11), and an enlargement (21) of the body (11) is
provided substantially aligned to the point of

attachment of the wings (18) to the front plate (12) 
between the two wings (18).
A lock according to either Claim 1 or 2,
wherein the wings (18) are integral with the body (11).
A lock according to Claim 3, wherein the body
(11) and wings (18) are made of plastic material.
A lock according to Claim 1, wherein the lock
operating mechanism is a cylinder (13) rotatable by

means of a key (15), and wherein the latch comprises a
retaining tab (16) bonded to said cylinder (13).
A lock according to Claim 1 or 5, and adapted
to be inserted and secured in a window (31) forming

said seat in the structure (30) to be locked, wherein
the wings (18) engage an edge (32) of the window (31).
