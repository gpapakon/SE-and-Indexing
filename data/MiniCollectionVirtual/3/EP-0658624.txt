<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recombinant genes capable of expressing 
placental protein 14 (PP14) and methods of producing the same. Human endometrium synthesizes several proteins under the influence of 
progesterone. Of these proteins, placental protein 14 (PP14) is of particular 
interest, as it is also present in circulation, and the PP14 concentrations in serum 
have been used as indicators of endometrial function. Although PP14 was initially 
isolated from human term placenta and hence named placental protein 14, 
subsequent studies indicate that its main site of synthesis during pregnancy is the 
decidua. By immunological criteria, PP14, progestogen-dependent endometrial 
protein, and pregnancy-associated endometrial α₂-globulin are indistinguishable and 
appear to represent different names for a single protein. See, M. Julkunen et al., 
"Complete amino acid sequence of human placental protein 14 ....", Proc. Nat'l 
Acad. Sci., Vol. 85, pp 8845-8849 (December 1988). Of the range of proteins which have been described as associated with the 
pregnant state, PP14 has been found to exhibit an immunosuppressive activity in 
a variety of in vitro tests. U.S. Patent 5,039,521, incorporated herein by reference 
discloses that the mode of action of this peptide has indicated that it inhibits IL-1 
production by peripheral white blood cells (containing both T-lymphocytes 
and  
 
monocytes) after stimulation. The concentration at which this protein is active 
appears to be the levels at which it is found normally in pregnancy. The time course of this inhibition of IL-1 production closely relates to the 
immunosuppressive activity of the molecule, indicating that its primary effect is on 
monocytes rather than other immune system cells. Unlike many other pregnancy-associated and placental proteins, which are 
present at maximal concentration in maternal serum at about 4-6 weeks before 
parturition, and whose material serum levels consequently tend to correlate with 
placental weight, e.g., pregnancy-associated α₂-glycoprotein, PP5 and hPL, 
circulating levels of PP14 fall during the whole of the third trimester and therefore 
are not related directly to placenta weight. A.E. Bolton, et al., "The 
radioimmunoassay of human placental protein 14 (PP14)", Clinica Chemica Acta, 
p. 283-291 (1983), discloses that the mean concentration of this protein in serum 
of 22 normal pregnant women showed a decline during the third trimester from 
120 µg/1 at 27 weeks gestation to 65 µg/1 at term. Serum samples from 16
