<ABSTRACT>
Pulse broadening in an optical transmission system due to wavelength 
dispersion 

is reduced by separating the different wavelength components (21,22) 
and selectively 

delaying them (23). Upon recombination, the original phases of the 
wavelength components are restored, and the pulses narrowed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical transmission systems and, in particular, to 
arrangements for reducing the effect of group-velocity dispersion in optical fibers. When optical waves of different wavelengths propagate along an optical fiber, 
they do so at different group velocities. This so-called chromatic, or group-velocity 
dispersion causes pulse broadening which limits the rate at which information can be 
carried through an optical fiber. Recently, there has been interest in dispersion 
compensators that use dual-mode fibers operated in the LP₁₁ spatial mode, close to 
their cutoff wavelength. Because higher-order spatial modes in optical fibers exhibit 
large, negative chromatic dispersion, such an arrangement provides a means for 
compensating for the positive dispersion in conventional single-mode fiber spans. See, 
for example, U.S. patent 5,185,827, issued February 9, 1993, and assigned to 
applicant's assignee. The attractiveness of using a dual-mode fiber for dispersion compensation stems 
from the ability to achieve large negative waveguide dispersion by operating close to 
the cutoff wavelength of the LP₁₁ mode, thereby minimizing the amount of fiber 
required to compensate a given amount of positive dispersion. While the use of less 
fiber reduces losses,
 
operation close to cutoff greatly increases sensitivity to bending losses, and it is these 
losses that place a practical limit on how much dispersion compensation can be 
realized. An alternative approach to this problem is the use of dispersion shifted fibers, 
as described in the article by V.A. Bhagavatula et al., entitled "Segmented Core Single-Mode 
Fibers with Low Loss and Low Dispersion," published in Electron Lett. 19, 317 
(1983). However, such fibers tend to be much lossy than one would like.  It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to effect low loss dispersion 
compensation without the use of long lengths of optical fibers or specially 
designed fibers. It is a further object of the invention to effect such compensation by 
means that are not sensitive to spatial mode orientation. When an optical pulse propagates along an optical fiber, the different wavelength 
components making up the pulse propagate with different group velocities. This 
results in a change in the relative phases of these components and the resulting 
broadening of the pulse. In accordance with the present invention, these phases are 
restored and the pulse narrowed by separating the different wavelength components 
and selectively
