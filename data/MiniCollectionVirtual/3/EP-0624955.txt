<ABSTRACT>
Using only one R2R network 2, driven by a digital logic 1, 
it is possible to implement both a D/A and an A/D converter. 

An existing stabilized voltage Vcc is used instead of a 
separate reference voltage source. The D/A and A/D converter 

is calibrated with this voltage and an operational amplifier 
4 circuited as a comparator. Starting with the known voltage 

value Vcc and the assigned bit combination, it is possible 
to measure analog voltages from analog voltage sources 10, 

11 using further operational amplifiers 5, 6 circuited as 
comparators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit configuration for a D/A 
and A/D converter with an R2R network and voltage 
comparators, preferably for inkjet printers. In modern inkjet printers employing the bubble-jet 
principle, the ink droplets are generated by heating 
resistors incorporated into the inkjet print head, see DE-OS 
3 012 698. It is important here that the heating pulses lie 
within given limits in order both to achieve the desired 
function and to protect the inkjet print head from damage. 
Inkjet print heads must not be allowed to get too hot, see 
WO 90/06852. The head temperature therefore has to be 
monitored. The monitoring is performed using sensors which 
supply corresponding analog voltages. A/D converters with 
reference voltage sources and comparators are required for 
digital evaluation of these voltages, see machine 
description "High Print 6200", print head control, page 4-4, 
Figure 4-2, Siemens AG 1990. On the other hand it is common to use a DC motor controlled 
by a motor driver circuit for the carriage drive. This motor 
driver circuit, in turn, receives its control voltage via a 
D/A converter with an R2R network as well as a reference 
voltage source and a comparator, see machine description 
"High Print 6200", print head carriage drive, page 4-see  
 
machine description "High Print 6200", print head control, 
page 4-1, Figure 4-1, Siemens AG 1990. The precision of the 
voltage conversion depends significantly on the precision of 
the reference voltage. Precision voltage sources, however, 
are expensive. Although a common digital logic (e.g. 
microcontroller, ASIC, discrete logic IC's, etc.) is used 
for the head control and carriage drive control, the amount 
of electronics used is still considerable. For cost reasons, 
a precise reference voltage is therefore dispensed with for 
the carriage drive control and it is fed directly with the 
output voltage from the digital logic - corresponding to TTL 
or CMOS level. This then results in inaccuracies of up to 
100% which can be compensated with a corresponding degree of 
control engineering. The object of the invention is to reduce the costs without 
limiting the performance characteristics. The invention is based on the problem of developing a 
circuit configuration with which both the A/D conversion for 
the temperature monitoring of the inkjet print head and the 
D/A conversion for the control of the print head carriage 
are possible with sufficient precision and which requires 
only a single reference voltage. Starting from
