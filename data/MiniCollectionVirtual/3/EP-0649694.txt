<ABSTRACT>
The tool is suitable for eliminating burrs from the 
inner and outer surfaces of circular cut rims of 

plastic tubes. 
It is a manually operated tool which may trim cut rims 
of tubes of various diameter. 
The tool, cylindrical in shape, includes cylindrical 
sectors 3, which form coaxial cylindrical intespaces 4 

where tubes, of corresponding diameter, may be 
inserted and trimmed and bevelled by two pairs of 

cutting edges (6e) of a blade 6. 
The tool may be used from both ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention consists in a manual tool to eliminate 
burrs from the inner and outer surfaces of circular 
cut rims of plastic tubes in PP, PVC, PE ecc., due to 
cutting by small saws or other tools. More in particular, it consists in a manually operated 
tool to eliminate burrs from cut rims of plastic tubes 
and to create, on the said cut rims, an indispensable 
bevelling in order to obtain a sufficient water-tight 
seal when connecting two tubes. Currently, in order to simultaneously trim and flare 
the inner and outer surfaces of cut rims of plastic 
tubes, assemblers use manual tools which permit 
trimming only of single diameter tubes. One of these such tools is formed by a cylindrical 
body, at the bottom of which are two independent 
blades, diametrically opposed, fitted so as to cause 
the trimming of the inner and outer parts 
respectively, of the cut rim of the tube, by means of 
a rotation of the tool around the cut rim of the tube 
or vice versa. The main drawback of the said tool lies in the 
impossibility to use it for tubes of varying diameters 
and the necessity to mount two independent blades to  
 
trim, simultaneously the outer and inner parts 
respectively, of the cut rim of the tube. This requires a set of tools of various sizes and, 
consequently, causes greater encumbrance and weight 
and extra working time to trim and flare tubes of 
various diameters. The tool, in accordance with the invention, is 
intended to remedy the above mentioned drawbacks and 
particularly, those with which, on site, assemblers of 
hydraulic plants, are faced. For such purposes the invention, as claimed, solves 
the problem of the application of the tool to trim 
plastic tubes of various diameters. The tool of cylindrical shape, includes cylindrical 
sectors which form coaxial cylindrical interspaces, in 
each of which a tube of various diameters may be 
inserted and the cut rim forced to be scraped, and 
consequently trimmed and bevelled, by two pairs of 
cutting edges of a sole blade 6, diametrically opposed 
and applied at the inlet of each of the said 
cylindrical interspaces. One way of carrying out the invention is described in 
detail below with reference to drawings which 
illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which:-

sectors) which divides the cylindrical external

" Tool to trim cut rims of plastic tubes having 
different diameter", comprising a hollow cylinder (1) 

and cutting edges, characterized by the fact that the 
hollow cylinder is subdivided in two equal cylindrical 

parts by a circular plate, which forms part of the 
same cylinder, so as to form two separate cylindrical 

cavities, the same plate incorporating, on both 
opposed sides, two equal and symmetrical sets of 

cylindrical sectors (3), of different diameter, 
coaxial to the axis of the cylinder, and diametrically 

opposed, which create cylindrical interspaces (4) into 
which tubes of corresponding diameters may be 

inserted, to rotate coaxially to the central axis of 
the same cylinder (1), the transversal surface of the 

opposite ends (3a) and (3b) of each set of cylindrical 
sectors (3) being complanar to the walls of a 

diametral slot (5) into which a blade (6) is 
introduced, the blade being fitted with two sets of 

cutting edges (6e) on both longitudinal borders, each 
set being formed by symmetrical couples of cutting 

edges diametrically opposed, in respect to the 
centerline of the same blade, so that the rim of each 

tube of corresponding diameter may be trimmed, in two 
diametrically opposed points, by the said couples of 

 
symmetrical cutting edges, each pair of the cutting 

edges delimiting the inlet through which the cut rim 
of the tube, of corresponding diameter, must pass so 

as to be scraped by the cutting edges of the blades. 
Tool to trim as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the cutting edges are formed by the corners 

(6e) of the trapezoidal teeth (6a) which partially 
obstruct the base of the rectangular inlets through 

which access is gained to the spaces (4) formed by the 
circular sectors (3) and that the corners (6e), 

forming the cutting edges, are opposed to the corners 
(6f) on contact with the sides (3a) and (3b) of the 

same circular sectors, the corners (6f) being 
reciprocaly distanced in order to form an opening 

passage, greater in area if compared to that formed by 
the corners (6e), for this purpose the shape of the 

top (6c) of each tooth being trapezoidal, the corners 
(6e) passing through the vertexes of the longer base 

and the corners (6f) through the vertexes of the 
smaller base of the trapezoidal area of the same top 

(6c). 
Tool to trim as in Claims 1 and 2, characterized by 
the fact that the cutting edges (6e) of the blade (6) 

carry out their cutting function in a direction normal 
to the surface of the same blade. 
Tool to trim as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the circular plate (2) forms, on each of the 

two sides a pair of small cavities (2b1) and (2b2) 
respectively, to gather burrs and cuttings from 

trimming, placed between the inlet and outlet of the 
interspaces (4) formed by the cylindrical sectors (3). 
Tool to trim as in Claims 1 and 4, characterized by 
the fact that the inner cylindrical side of the hollow 

cylinder, in correspondence with the inlet and outlet 
of the two sets of interspaces (4) of larger diameter, 

presents arch-shaped longitudinal grooves which extend 
until the underlying small cavities (2b1) and (2b2). 
Tool to trim as in Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the blade (6) is fitted, on both 

longitudinal borders, with trapezoidal teeth, the 
corners of which form cutting edges suitable to 

perform their function in the direction normal to the 
plain of the same blade, the tops (6c) of the same 

teeth being trapezoidal in shape, the blade being 
applied in such a way that the corners (6e) of the 

teeth, passing through the vertexes of the base of the 
trapezoidal surface (6c), constitute the front cutting 

edges of the same blade, or rather, those which first 
meet the cut rim of the tube during its clockwise 

rotation.
