<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to indwelling medical articles, such as
catheters, coated with antibiotics to inhibit bacterial growth.Indwelling medical devices including vascular catheters are becoming
essential in the management of hospitalized patients by providing venous access.
The benefit derived from these catheters as well as other types of catheters such as
peritoneal catheters, cardiovascular, orthopedic and other prosthetic devices is
often upset by infectious complications. The most common organisms causing
these infectious complications are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus
aureus. In the case of vascular catheters, these two organisms account for almost
70-80% of all infectious organisms, with Staphylococcus epidermidis being the
most common organism. Candida albicans, a fungal agent, account for about 10-15%
of catheter infections.Colonization of bacteria on the interior surfaces of the catheter or other
part of the device can produce serious patient problems, including the need to
remove and/or replace the implanted device and to vigorously treat secondary
infective conditions. A considerable amount of attention and study has been
directed toward preventing such colonization by the use of antimicrobial agents,
such as antibiotics, bound to the surface of the materials employed in such 
devices. In such attempts the objective has been to produce a sufficient
bacteriostatic or bactericidal action to prevent colonization.Vancomycin was thought to be the logical antibiotic to use since it is the
antibiotic of choice to treat systemic staphylococcal infections, particularly
methicillin resistant S. epidermidis and S. aureus. However, vancomycin has
several limitations:
(a) While several investigators have shown that vancomycin is active
against nonadherent staphylococci in vitro and human tissue, it is
not active against the staphylococci that adhere to foreign bodies and
embed themselves in a layer of biofilm. The biofilm (slime or
fibrous glycocalix) not only acts as a shield protecting the adherent
staphylococci from vancomycin, but also inhibits the activity of
glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). See e.g.
Farber et al. J. Infect. Dis. 161:37-40 (1990); and Evans et al.,
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 31:889-894 (1987). (b) Using vancomycin prophylactically on a highly colonized surface
(such as a catheter) will lead to the emergence of vancomycin
resistant staphylococci, and would deprive the clinician of the only
available therapeutic choice (glycopeptide
