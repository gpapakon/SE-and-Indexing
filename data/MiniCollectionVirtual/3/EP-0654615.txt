<ABSTRACT>
A disclosure is made of a support of a brake pad in the brake-pad well of a disc brake, in which the brake-pad well has two lateral guide faces (31) for the brake pad (10), which is supported on the exit-side guide face of the brake-pad well when it rests against the brake disc (1) during braking. To ensure that no circumferential oblique wear occurs, it is proposed to support the brake pad on the exit-side guide face (31) of the brake-pad well by means of an oblique plane which slopes downwards in the direction of brake application and the slope of which is chosen to be at least as great as the angle of friction.
