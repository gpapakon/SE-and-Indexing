<ABSTRACT>
An intraluminal grafting system (50) having a balloon 
catheter assembly (51), a capsule catheter assembly (52) and capsule 

jacket assembly (53) is used for deploying a graft (55) having attachment 
means in the vessel of an animal body. The system (50) contains 

a proximal capsule means (130) and a distal capsule means (90), wherein 
the graft (55) is disposed within the two capsule means (90,130) and a 

removable sheath (160) covers the graft (55) and capsule means (90,130). 
The graft (55) 

is comprised of a tubular member having superior and inferior 
ends, having attachment means with wall engaging members 

secured thereto. The balloon catheter (51) is disposed within the 
capsule catheter (52) to provide relative movement between the 

balloon catheter (51) and the capsule catheter (52), whereby the graft 
(55) can be removed from the capsule means (90,130). The balloon (60) 

is inflated 
to firmly implant the graft (55) and attachment means within the 

vessel. The graft (55) and attachment means remain in the vessel 
after the intraluminal grafting system (50) is withdrawn.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for emplacing a
prosthesis and, more particularly, to a catheter system for
placement of a graft having attachment means within a corporeal
lumen.It is well established that various fluid conducting
bodies or corporeal lumens, such as veins and arteries, may
deteriorate or suffer trauma so that repair is necessary. For
example, various types of aneurysms or other deteriorative
diseases may affect the ability of a lumen to conduct fluids
and in turn may be life-threatening. In some cases, the
damaged lumen is repairable only with the use of a prosthesis
such as an artificial vessel or graft.For repair of vital vessels such as the aorta, surgical
repair is significantly life-threatening. Surgical techniques 
known in the art involve major surgery in which a graft
resembling the natural vessel is spliced into the diseased or
obstructed section of the natural vessel. Known procedures
include surgically removing or bypassing the damaged or
diseased portion of the vessel and inserting an artificial or
donor graft inserted and stitched to the ends of the vessel
which were created by the removal of the diseased portion.It is known within the art to provide a prothesis for
intraluminal repair of a vessel, such as an abdominal aorta
having an aneurysm. The art has taught to provide a prothesis
positioned in a vessel then securing the prothesis within the
vessel with hooks or staples that are mechanically extended
by the user. The early prior art devices were large in
diameter, mechanically complex and in turn were susceptible
to mechanical failure. Prior intraluminal grafting systems
have embodied capsule catheters or balloon catheters, but were
relatively stiff and of a relatively high profile. Similarly,
the prior art systems were configured in such a way that the
graft was relatively difficult to deploy. In
addition, prior systems having capsule catheter means were
usually configured such that the prothesis was disposed within
a unitary capsule.In recent years, several devices have been developed
to attempt to treat an aortic aneurysm through intraluminal
repair. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,126 (Feb. 20, 1979),
Choudhury, discloses a method and article for performing an
aneurysm repair, wherein a prosthetic graft is utilized to
replace the damaged segment of the blood vessel. A plurality 
of radially spaced anchoring pins are located adjacent each
end of the graft and provide means for securing the graft to
the wall of the vessel. Means is provided for moving the graft
