<ABSTRACT>
A foldable, foursided frame, particularly intended for use as a side-wall member in a case (1), as a loading-pallet collar or the like, has two confronting long side walls (2, 3) and two confronting short side walls (4, 5), said long and short walls being hingedly interconnected at the frame corners by means of corner joining members (6-9), such as flexible joining strips. One (2) of the long side walls consists of two juxtaposed wall parts (2', 2"), one (2') of which is hingedly connected to one (4) of the short side walls by means of one (6) of the corner joining members, whereas the other wall part (2") is hingedly connected to the opposite short side wall (5) by means of another one (9) of the corner joining members, said wall parts being hingedly interconnected by means of a supplementary joining member (10), such as a flexible joining strip. Said one (2') wall part has a width equalling that of said one (4) of the short side walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a foldable, foursided
frame intended particularly for use as a side-wall
member in a case, e.g. as a loading-pallet collar or rim,
said frame having two confronting long side walls and two
confronting short side walls, said long and short side
walls being hingedly interconnected at the frame corners
by means of corner joining members, such as flexible
joining strips.In the manufacture of wooden cases from panels, such
as plywood plates of wood-fibre base panels, the panels
forming the long walls of the case usually are hingedly
interconnected in order to allow the case to be transported
in a collapsed, space-saving condition when not in
use, and to be erected into box shape in preparation for
use. In order to allow the case to be folded or collapsed
it is necessary that the case bottom panel be removable
or else be hingedly connected to one of the side walls.
This also applies to the case lid, if provided.In accordance with prior-art technology a flexible
yet comparatively rigid metal tape is used to interconnect
the panels. The metal tape is formed with spikes or
barbs which have been punched in the tape in rows extending
along the tape and which project at right angles from
one side thereof. The spikes are pointed and to interconnect
two panels they are hammered into the panels to
anchor the tape thereto.However, the metal tape is disadvantageous in the
respect that it can be bent forwards and backwards only
once or twice before cracking or the spikes loosening
from the panels. Thus, it does not lend itself to repeated
folding and unfolding and consequently it prevents
repeated use of the case. In addition, the metal tape is
unpleasant to handle since the spikes easily cause injuries.
The risk that this should happen is particularly
imminent when the tape has separated from the panels. 
A further disadvantage in using metal tapes is that
they are inconvenient to dispose of in connection with
destruction of the case, for instance through incineration.A different, prior-art technology therefore preferably
is resorted to for the interconnection, involving
the use of a joining strip of a flexible plastics material
which is attached to the two panels that are to be
hingedly interconnected.When an empty, foursided case having panel-shaped
side walls that are hingedly interconnected by means of
flexible metal tapes or plastic strips is collapsed or
folded for transportation, it will have a width corresponding
to the height of the case and a length corresponding
to the sum of

<CLAIMS>
A foldable, foursided frame intended particularly
for use as a side-wall member in a case (1), as a loading-pallet

collar, or the like, said frame having two
confronting long side walls (2, 3) and two confronting

short side walls (4, 5), said long and short side walls
being hingedly interconnected at the frame corners by

means of corner joining members (6-9), such as flexible
joining strips, 
characterised
 in that one (2)
of the long side walls consists of two juxtaposed wall

parts (2', 2"), one (2') of which is hingedly connected
to one (4) of the short side walls by means of one (6) of

the corner joining members, whereas the other wall part
(2") is hingedly connected to the confronting short side

wall (5) by means of another one (9) of the corner joining
members, said wall parts being hingedly interconnected

by means of a supplementary joining member (10), such
as a flexible joining strip, said one (2') of the wall

parts being equal in width to said one (4) of the short
side walls.
A frame as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised

in that said supplementary joining member
is a flexible plastics strip extending along the height

of said one (2) of the long side walls.
