<ABSTRACT>
In a hook body (5) which is provided to be embedded in a moulded foam part and has hooking elements (9) on its front side, a covering element which covers the entire surface of the hooking elements (9) and seals them off against the penetration of foam during the foaming of the moulded part in a mould is provided in the form of a layer of a sealing compound (13) which can be removed from the hooking elements (9) to expose them again. An uncured thermoplastic material is provided as the sealing compound (13), which after removal can be melted down and used again for the same purpose.

Adhering body for incorporation by foaming into a moulded 
foam part, having:
 
   an adhering fastening part (7; 107) which has hooking 

elements (9; 109) on its front side;
 
   an anchoring part (11; 111) which is attached to the rear 

side of the adhering fastening part (7; 107) and can be incorporated 
by foaming into the surfact of the moulded foam part in 

order to anchor the adhering body (5; 105); and
 
   a cover element which covers the entire face of the 

hooking elements (9; 109) and seals those elements against the 
ingress of foam during the foaming of the moulded part in a 

mould and which is formed by a layer of a plastics sealing 
composition (13; 113) which, on the front side of the adhering 

body (5; 105), covers the adhering fastening part (7; 107) in 
such a manner that at least the outer ends of the hooking elements 

(9; 109) are embedded in the sealing composition (13; 113) 
and which can be pulled off the hooking elements (9; 109) in 

order to expose them; characterised in that an uncrosslinked 
thermoplastic synthetic material which, after being pulled off, 

can be melted down and reused for the same purpose is provided 
as the sealing composition (13; 113). 
Adhering body according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
a synthetic rubber is provided as the thermoplastic synthetic 

material for the sealing composition (13; 113). 
Adhering body according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the sealing composition (13; 113), which is continuous from 

longitudianl edge to longitudinal edge, extends over the entire 
face of the adhering body (5; 105) and, during the foaming of 

the moulded part in the mould, can be accomodated in a recessed 
receiving member (3; 103) of the mould in order to secure the 

adhering body (5; 105) in the mould by positve locking.  
 
Adhering body according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that, in order to form a dovetail-shaped cross-section of the 

joint formed by the adhering body (105) and the sealing composition 
(113), the longitudinal edges of the joint are inclined.
