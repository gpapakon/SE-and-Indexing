<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a resin coating method capable 
of coating thinly and uniformly surfaces of a semiconduct
or 
laser chip (5) and photodiode chips (4A and 4B) in a 

semiconductor laser device (3) with a resin. The 
semiconductor laser device (3) is fixed to a turntable (1) 

with a laser beam emission window (7A) of a cap (7) opened 
upward. A resin (6) is dropped on the chips (5, 4A, and 

4B) inside the cap (7) through the laser beam emission 
window (7A), and then the turntable (1) is made to spin 

around a spindle which extends in a direction approximately 
perpendicular to the turntable to thereby flow a 

superfluous portion (6A) of the dropped resin (6) toward an 
internal wall of the cap (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin coating
method for a semiconductor laser device, and more
particularly to a method for coating surfaces of a
semiconductor laser chip and a photodiode chip constituting
a semiconductor laser device with a resin.As shown in Fig. 5, there have been many methods
of constructing a semiconductor laser device 3 by mounting
a semiconductor laser chip 5 and photodiode chips 4A and 4B
on a projecting portion 8A of a stem 8 and covering them
with a cap 7 having a laser beam emission window 7A. The
photodiode chip 4A serves to receive a laser beam reflected
on an object (not shown), while the photodiode chip 4B
serves to monitor an output of the semiconductor laser chip
5.Conventionally, as shown in Fig. 5, the surfaces
of the chips 5, 4A, and 4B have been coated with a resin 6
potted (dropped) inside the cap 7 by means of an injector 
18. With the resin coating, the semiconductor laser device
is allowed to have an improved reliability.However, according to the above-mentioned
conventional resin coating method, the resin 6 has been
merely potted inside the cap 7. Therefore, the resin 6 has
been superfluously heaped up thickly on the semiconductor
laser chip 5 and the photodiode chips 4A and 4B, which has
resulted in an ununiformed thickness of the resin to exert
bad influence on the optical characteristics of the
semiconductor laser device 3. EP-A-0 607 700, which is prior art under Article 54(3) EPC for all states (DE, FR,
NL), discloses a semiconductor laser device of the type shown in Fig. 5. The laser chip and
the photodiode are covered by a resin layer which is less than 500µm thick.JP-A-5 096 229 discloses a method of applying a resin layer to a square substrate.
The resin is placed on the centre of the substrate, and the substrate is rotated so as to spread
the resin over the substrate. Rotation of the substrate would tend to cause turbulence since it
is square, and gas is directed towards the substrate to reduce the turbulence.JP-A-56 070 635 discloses a method of coating a substrate with a layer of photoresist.
The substrate is held over a tank of liquid photoresist and is lowered towards the liquid. The
liquid is then vibrated, and the vibrations of the liquid cause the liquid to come into contact
with the substrate.The present invention provides a method of resin coating a semiconductor laser device
wherein a semiconductor laser chip and a photodiode chip are mounted on a stem and the
chips are covered with a cap which has a laser beam emission window at a top
