<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support and cooling 
arrangement for a turbocharger (1) of a large diesel engine. 

It comprises a body part (2) attached to the engine block (3), 
provided with a base (18) for supporting the turbocharger (1) 

and including a first water duct (11), through which cooling 
water can pass into the turbocharger (1), and a second water 

duct (12), through which cooling water leaves the turbocharger 
(1). The base (18) includes openings (19, 20, 21) for 

connection to the first (11) and second (12) water ducts and 
thermostatic valve means (13) in connection with the second 

water duct (12) and which on the basis of the temperature of 
the cooling water leaving the turbocharger (1), leads the 

cooling water on one hand for recirculation (14) and on the 
other hand for cooling (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a support and cooling 
arrangement for a turbocharger in a large diesel engine, the 
arrangement being according to the preamble of claim 1. A large diesel engine as referred to herein means an 
engine usable for example as the main propulsion engine or as 
an auxiliary engine for a ship or for power generation in the 
form of heat and/or electricity in a power plant. According to known techniques the bracket for a 
turbocharger in this kind of large engine has usually been 
made of welded-together structures supporting pipework for the 
cooling water required for the cooling of the turbocharger. 
As a result of this the number of elements and pipe joints has 
been great and the manufacturing and assembling of the 
brackets has been laborious and time-consuming. In addition 
the numerous joints required give rise to uncertainty as to 
their long-term tightness, because the vibrations, caused by 
the engine, stress the piping, joints and supporting 
structures of the bracket. Examples of known turbocharger support and cooling apparatus are shown in DE-A-2 833 790 which is considered to be the closest prior art and EP-A-0 302 245. However EP-A-0 302 245 only discloses a small engine and does not disclose the use of a separate support unit for the turbocharger. An aim of the invention is to create a new supporting 
arrangement for a turbocharger by means of which the drawbacks 
mentioned above have essentially been avoided. A further aim 
of the invention is to integrate a number of possible 
different additional functions to the structure and in that 
way to reduce the number of different elements, which makes 
the assembling easier and is advantageous with regard to space 
requirements. A still further aim is to improve the 
structural reliability of the supporting arrangement 
particularly in the face of engine vibrations. These aims can be met with an arrangement according to claim 1.  
 In this way the components required for the cooling of the 
turbocharger are essentially integrated into a unitary 
supporting structure which substantially reduces the number 
of component parts and joints required and at the same time 
improves the reliability of the structure. Integration can be further developed so that the body 
part comprises a duct for leading cooling water supplied from 
the engine block into the second water duct upstream of the 
thermostatic valve means. In addition the first water duct 
can be arranged to branch inside the body part into two 
separate ducts so that
