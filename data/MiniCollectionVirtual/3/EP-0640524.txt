<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises a method for 
injecting a heavier payload into orbit than is possible 

using a traditional method and the same rocket booster 
launch vehicle. The method of the present invention 

does not utilize a parking orbit and does not perform 
orbital injection at perigee or apogee of the desired 

orbit. Rather, in the present method the flight path 
angle is positive at the final lower stage booster burn 

so as to boost the perigee kick motor and payload into 
a suborbital trajectory (36) having a low perigee, which may 

be below the surface of the Earth (8). In the preferred 
embodiment, the launch vehicle maintains a negative 

flight path angle during the PKM burn. The PKM burn 
does not occur at perigee, but perigee is at the 

desired location when the PKM burn is complete. Use of 
this method increases the payload capacity of some 

launch vehicles by up to fifty percent (50%).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for injecting
payloads into orbit, and more particularly, to a
method employing a suborbital trajectory instead of a
conventional parking orbit and wherein the final launch
booster burn for injection into a desired elliptical
orbit, for example, a geosynchronous transfer orbit
("geo-transfer orbit" or "GTO"), is non-apsidal (i.e.,
does not occur at the apogee or perigee of that orbit)
and occurs while the flight path angle is either
negative or positive.Many types of orbital trajectories can
utilize this method, including: (1) geo-transfer
orbits; (2) "Molniya" orbits or other elliptical orbits
having a specified initial position of the line of
apsides; and (3) any trajectories requiring significantly
lower inclinations than their launch site latitudes.
Although a geo-transfer orbit is used as the
primary example in this specification, those skilled in
the art will appreciate the method's application to the
other types of orbital trajectories.The process of injecting a payload into orbit
with a multi-stage launch booster vehicle has several
constraints. The booster must provide sufficient
energy or velocity to reach orbital conditions and, if
the desired orbit is elliptical, it may be desirable to
place the line of apsides (i.e., the line connecting
orbit apogee and perigee) at a specific initial
location. For example, with geo-transfer orbits it is
often a requirement that the line of apsides be at or
near the equator. This is because the burn performed 
at apogee often needs to combine the orbit raising
maneuver to geosynchronous altitude with an inclination
change maneuver to achieve 0° inclination (geo-stationary
orbit), as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2A."Molniya"-type orbits are another example of
orbits with respect to which it is desirable to place
the line of apsides at a specific location. By
definition the Molniya orbits are highly elliptical and
inclined 63.4°, which is a unique inclination in that
the line of apsides does not rotate -- i.e., apogee and
perigee remain at the same latitude. These orbits
often are used where long periods of satellite
operation are desired over the northern hemisphere --i.e.,
apogee over the northern hemisphere. This
requires that perigee be placed in the southern
hemisphere, typically at a latitude of 63.4° south.
The placement of the perigee at locations far from the
nominal burnout location of the booster for vehicles
launched in the northern hemisphere, as is required for
geo-transfer and Molniya orbits, complicates the
trajec

A method for injecting a payload into an elliptical orbit
having its line of apsides at a specific initial location

comprising the steps of:

firing at least one lower stage engine of a rocket
booster vehicle carrying the payload so as to launch the

rocket booster vehicle and payload along a suborbital trajectory;
allowing the vehicle to coast downrange in the suborbital
trajectory; and
firing an upper stage engine of the rocket booster vehicle
to cause the payload to be injected into the elliptical

orbit, characterized in that the location at which firing
of the upper stage engine is commenced is not at or

near perigee of the elliptical orbit, nor at or near apogee
of the elliptical orbit.
The method of claim 1 wherein the flight path angle of
the rocket booster vehicle is positive along a first portion

of the suborbital trajectory along which the at least
one lower stage engine is fired, and is negative along a

second portion of the suborbital trajectory, along which
the upper stage engine commences firing.
The method of claim 2 wherein the flight path angle of
the rocket booster vehicle is negative throughout the firing

of the upper stage engine.
The method of claim 3 wherein the thrust of the upper
stage engine is pointed substantially along the velocity

vector of the rocket booster vehicle throughout the firing
of the upper stage engine. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the flight path angle of
the rocket booster vehicle is more negative when firing of

the upper stage engine is commenced than when it is completed.
The method of claim 3 wherein the firing of the upper
stage engine is completed above a minimum altitude whereby

excessive free molecular heating of the vehicle is avoided.
The method of claims 1 to 6 wherein the perigee of the
elliptical orbit is downrange from the location at which

the payload is injected into the elliptical orbit.
The method of claims 1 to 6 wherein the perigee of the
elliptical orbit is up range from the location at which the

payload is injected into the elliptical orbit.
The method of claims 1 to 8 wherein the elliptical orbit
is a geosynchronous transfer orbit.
The method of claims 1 to 8 wherein the elliptical orbit
is a Molniya orbit.
