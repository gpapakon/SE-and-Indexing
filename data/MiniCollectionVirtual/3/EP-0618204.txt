<ABSTRACT>
A heterocyclic compound represented by general formula (I), which has an excellent positive inotropic action as a cardiotonic 
and inhibits the rise of heart rate, and a cardiotonic containing the same as the active ingredient, wherein group A-E represents 

-S-CR₄R₅-, -CH₂-S-, -NH-CH₂- or -CH₂-CH₂-.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds
represented by the formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts thereof and cardiotonic agents containing the
heterocyclic compounds as effective components:

wherein R and R1 represent hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group;
R2 and R3 may be independently same or different and represent
hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower alkoxy group,
trifluoromethyl group, halogen atom, nitro group, amino group,
cyano group or hydroxyl group or R2 and R3 are joined to form
methylenedioxy group or

forms naphthalene; and
A-E represents

-CH2-S-, -NH-CH2- or -CH2CH2-
wherein R4 and R5 represent hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group.Certain embodiments are subject of the dependent claims.Compounds represented by the following formula (II) are known as 
heterocyclic compounds having cardiotonic activity and are disclosed for
example in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication (Kokai) Nos. 57-2284
and 58-131981 and Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 61-53350.

wherein R1 and A-E are as defined above.These known heterocyclic compounds having cardiotonic activities
were clinically unfavorable since they have not so strong cardiotonic
activities and increase heart rate.We, the inventors carried out studies to succeed in synthesizing
novel heterocyclic compounds having excellent positive inotropic effect
as cardiotonic agent and suppressing increase of heart rate, by
modifying the pyridyl group in the compound of the formula (II), thus
completing the present invention. More specifically, the present
invention is directed to tetrahydropyridine derivatives represented by
the above-mentioned formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable acid
addition salts thereof and cardiotonic agents containing them as
effective components.The terms used for definition of letters in the above-mentioned
formula by which the compounds of the present invention are represented
are defined and exemplified in the following.The wording "lower" refers to a group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms
unless otherwise indicated. The "lower alkyl group" refers to a straight- or branched-chain
alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl,
n-pentyl, n-hexyl or the like.The "lower alkoxy group" refers to a straight- or branched-chain
alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy,
tert-butoxy, n-pentyloxy, n-hexyloxy or the like.The "halogen atom" may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine
atom.The compound according to the present
