<ABSTRACT>
A rotary display apparatus of the kind having a set 
of parallel rotatable vanes (20), each of equilateral 

triangle cross-section, providing three display surfaces, 
has each vane supported in a fixed bearing (40) at one 

end and in a bearing (42) at the other formed in a 
resilient spring finger (44, 144). Each vane is hollow 

and provided with a bearing member (26), all the bearing 
members are identical. Each spring finger (144) is 

mounted to have its free end facing the direction the 
vane is inserted in the apparatus and the free end is 

provided with a chamfered camming surface (210) to ease 
insertion, the associated vane bearing (26) acting 

against resilience of the finger (144). A cam drive 
arrangement (50) for the set of vanes (20) has a 

respective cam (70) mounted on a common drive shaft to 
act directly on an end portion (52) of the vane. A 

bidirectionally rotatable cam is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary vane display apparatus 
of the kind employing a plurality of elongate members 
each having a plurality of display faces and each 
rotatable to provide a plurality of display surfaces for 
the apparatus. The conventional apparatus of this kind employs 
members of triangular cross-section, commonly referred to 
as vanes or louvres, each having three display faces. 
The vanes are mounted in parallel and are synchronously 
rotatable about their long axes to provide three 
successively presented, display surfaces for the overall 
display unit. An example of such a rotary display unit 
is disclosed in EP-A 0249,396. Such units have found 
wide acceptance in providing changing displays of 
advertising material or other information. There are numerous other examples of rotary vane display 
units of this type. Reference may be made, for example, 
to U.S. patents 3 367 049 (Noreen) and 3 383 785 (Werner) 
and to British patent specification GB 2 134 301A 
(Prismavision). EP-A- 0 249 396 (F. S. Displays) also 
discloses a particular form of cam drive for the set of 
vanes that extends along one side of the display. The 
cam drive has a respective cam for each vane that engages 
a respective cam follower member inserted in the end of 
each vane. The particular camming arrangement disclosed 
is unidirectional. It is also known in synchronously 
rotating the sets of vanes from one display face to the  
 
next to arrange a successive offset of the cams so that 
each display change ripples along the set of vanes before 
they achieve a common dwell period at which the next 
stationary display face is presented. It is further 
known from US-A-3 273 271 to provide a spring-biassed 
retention of the vanes in their operative position, the 
vanes being disengageable from their normal mounting by 
an axial movement against the spring bias. Rotary vane display units have been made in various 
sizes from units accommodating conventional advertising 
poster sizes to large units intended to be seen by the 
public from some distance away. Smaller units have been 
produced which will fit into a shop counter. We have identified a market for a compact, and 
preferably free-standing display unit, whose dimensions 
may range down to say 150 x 150 mm. of display area or 
less. Such displays could find wide acceptance if they 
can be manufactured inexpensively using a minimum of 
components and with ease of assembly and disassembly. 
There will be described hereinafter a new design of 
rotary vane

<CLAIMS>
A rotary vane display apparatus comprising a 
plurality of vanes (20) mounted in parallel for rotation 

about their longitudinal axes, each vane having a 
plurality of display facets, and means (50) to drive said 

vanes for rotation about their respective axes to provide 
a plurality of display surfaces, characterized in that 

each vane has a pin portion (38, 138) at one end received 
for rotation in a bearing (42, 142) provided by a 

respective apertured yieldable spring member (44, 144), 
said spring member (44, 144) having a fixed end portion 

(25, 125) and a free end portion (210) such that said pin 
portion (38, 138) is receivable in said respective 

aperture (42, 142) by engagement of said free end portion 
(210) by said pin portion to cause said spring member 

(44, 144) to flex about its fixed end and allow said pin 
portion (38, 138) to be slid towards said respective 

aperture (42, 142). 
A rotary vane display apparatus as claimed in Claim 
1, in which said free end portion (210) of each spring 

member (44, 144) comprises a camming surface (210) 
engageable by a pin portion (38, 138) to cause the spring 

member (44, 144) to yield. 
A rotary vane display apparatus as claimed in Claim 
2 in which said free end portion (210) of each spring 

member (44, 144) is chamfered to provide said camming 
surface (210).  

 
A rotary vane display apparatus as claimed in Claim 
1, 2, or 3 in which each vane comprises a member of

7 in which a respective bearing member (26) including a 
pin portion is received in each end portion of each 

hollow vane member, all the bearing members being of the 
same construction. 
A rotary vane display apparatus as claimed in Claim 
6 or 8 in which the pin portion of each bearing member at 

the other end of each vane is received in a respective
