<ABSTRACT>
An impact tool for striking a tool (16) such as a chisel 
includes a piston (18) mounted in a cylinder (15). Upper (25), middle (28) and 

lower (29) chambers are formed therebetween. Pressure oil is fed 
into and discharged from the middle and lower chambers to 

reciprocate the piston in the cylinder under oil pressure. 
During a downward stroke of the piston, the oil pressure in 

the lower chamber is kept low. But just before it strikes a 
tool, the oil pressure is adapted to increase so as to 

prevent what is called cavitation or prevent air bubbles 
mixed in the pressure oil in the lower chamber from growing 

suddenly owing to a sharp drop in the oil pressure which is 
caused by the rebound of the piston after striking the tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic 
impact tool adapted to be mounted on the head of 
a hydraulic power shovel or the like and used to 
demolish a concrete structure, to crush rocks, to 
excavate a rock base, or the like. Hydraulic impact tools can be classified 
roughly into an accumulator type and a gas pressure 
type. With an accumulator type tool, pressurized oil 
is accumulated in an accumulator while a piston is 
rising and is released during its downward stroke to 
accelerate the piston. With a gas pressure type tool, one example of 
which is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 54-32192, a piston compresses a gas filled 
in the space above the piston to store energy when 
it rises under oil pressure. During its downward 
stroke, the compressed gas expands to accelerate 
the piston. The impact tool disclosed in the abovesaid 
Publication is shown in Fig. 13 in which 
numeral 1 designates a cylinder having a tool 2 
such as a chisel slidably mounted in the lower end 
thereof. A piston 4 formed with a large-diameter portion 
3 is mounted in the cylinder 1 to strike the tool 2. 
The cylinder 1 has an upper chamber 5 charged 
with gas over the piston 4 to exert the gas pressure 
on to the piston 4 as it reaches its upper limit. The piston 4 has small-diameter portions over 
and under the large-diameter portion 3. A middle 
chamber 6 and a lower chamber 7 are formed 
between the small-diameter portions and the inner 
periphery of the cylinder 1. A valve chest 8 is formed at one side of the 
cylinder 1. A valve body 10 formed with a center 
bore is mounted in the valve chest 8. The valve 
chest communicates with the cylinder 1 through oil 
channels extending from the upper and lower parts 
of the former to the upper part of the middle 
chamber 6 and to the lower part of the lower 
chamber 7, respectively. Further, the cylinder 1 
and the valve chest 8 have their respective mid-portions 
communicating with each other by means 
of one main oil channel and a branch channel. The valve chest 8 has its upper and lower parts 
connected to a discharge port 11 and an oil feed 
port 12, respectively. From the oil feed port 12, 
another oil channel branches and leads to the top 
end of a plunger 13 for pressing down the valve 
body 10. In operation, when the valve body 10 is at its 
lower limit, pressure oil is supplied through the oil 
feed port 12 to pressurize the lower chamber 7. 
Since the middle chamber 6 is open to the discharge 
port 11, the piston 4 rises up the cylinder to 
compres

A hydraulic impact tool for striking a tool such as 
a chisel, comprising:
 
   a cylinder (15) having the tool (16) slidably 

mounted therein at a lower end thereof;
 
   a piston (18) reciprocably mounted in the cylinder 

(15) for striking the tool (16) during its downward 
movements;
 
   said piston (18) being formed with the large-diameter 

portion (17) at the middle portion thereof, an 
upper small-diameter portion (19) and a lower small-diameter 

portion (20);
 
   said cylinder having an upper chamber (25) filled 

with a gas to apply gas pressure to the top of said piston 
(18) when said piston (18) is in its upper position, and a 

middle chamber (28) and a lower chamber (29) defined 
between the inner pheriphery of said cylinder (15) and 

portions of said piston (18) directly above and directly 
below said large-diameter portion (17), respectively;
 
   a valve chest (30) connected to said middle chamber 

(28) and said lower chamber (29) and an oil supply port 
(58) and an oil discharge port (59);
 
   a valve body (33) slidably mounted in said valve 

chest (30); and
 
   an oil circuit for controlling the communication 

between said middle chamber (28) in said lower chamber (29) 
on one hand and said oil supply port (58) and said oil 

discharge port (59) on the other hand to alternately raise 
and lower said piston (18) under the pressure of said gas 

and oil,
  
 

   characterized in that said oil discharge port (59) 
is provided in such a position as to communicate with said 

middle chamber (28), when said valve body (33) is at its 
lowermost position and not to communicate with said middle 

chamber (28), when said valve body (33) is at its uppermost 
position,
 
   that while said piston (18) is moving downward to 

strike the tool and said valve body (33) is in its upward 
movement said lower chamber (29) is in communication with 

said oil discharge port (59) through center bore (32) of 
said valve body (33), and that when said piston (18) has 

further moved downwards until an actuating chamber (49) 
communicates with said middle chamber (28), said oils 

supply port (58) communicates with said lower chamber (29)

(38) or (65), annular groove (41), middle chamber (28), and 
valve chest (30), center bore (32) of valve body (33) and
