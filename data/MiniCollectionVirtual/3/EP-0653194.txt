<ABSTRACT>
This prosthesis comprises, in combination, a femoral element (1) receiving a transverse articulation shaft (3) mounted freely rotatably with respect to a cylindrical rod (5) engaged in a vertical sheath (6) of a tibial element (2) in order to permit movements of flexion and rotation; the femoral element bears via its condylar blocks (1c), (1d) on a tibial shoulder (2b) of the element (2) by way of a polyethylene plateau (9) which is mounted with the capacity for limited angular displacement in a horizontal plane on the said tibial shoulder.

Complete knee prosthesis comprising a
femoral element (1) accommodating a transve
rse hinge
pin (3) mounted so that it can rotate freely relative

to a cylindrical rod (5) fitted so that it can rotate
freely in a vertical sleeve (6) of a tibial element

(2) in order to allow flexing and rotating movements,
the condylar pads (1c) (1d) of said femoral element

resting on a tibial base (2b) of element (2) through
a polyethylene plate (9) mounted so that it is

capable of limited angular displacement in a
horizontal plane on said tibial base, the condylar

pads (1c, 1d) alone being capable of causing angular
displacement of polyethylene plate (9) on tibial base

(2b).
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that hinge pin (3) is mounted so

that it can rotate freely in a transverse bush (4)
joined to vertical sleeve (6) of the tibial

element, said bush being fitted into a hollow
protrusion (1b) of the femoral element constituting a

fork joint.
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that hinge pin (3) is mounted in

bush (4) by means of needle-type roller bearings (7).
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 2
characterised in that bush (4) has, substantially at

the level of the tibial plate, a spur (4a) that acts
as a limit stop and co-operates with a part of the

protrusion (1b) when the femoral element is in the
flexed position. 
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that plate (9) is joined to the

tibial element with the capacity for angular
displacement by means of studs (10) joined to said

element and co-operating, through a shaped head
(10a), with shaped slots (9a) formed in the thickness

of said plate.
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that sleeve (6) has at least one

means (8) capable of co-operating in compression with
rod (5), said means (8) being devised to be

elastically stressed in combination with features of
rod (5) and of sleeve (6) in order to allow:


insertion of the rod into the sleeve by
exerting a slight force and locking in position,
withdrawal of the rod from the sleeve, by
exerting a force in excess of the above force, which

corresponds to releasing it.
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 6
characterised in that the features consist of a

tapered bearing surface formed at the end of the rod
and of a circular throat (6a) formed in sleeve (6),

said throat being capable of accommodating means (8)
in a predetermined position relative to a part of the

rod that accommodates said means (8) in the locked
position.
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that the part of rod (5) that

accommodates means (3) in the locked position
consists of a recess (5a) in which means (8) is/are

fitted by elasticity after inserting rod (5) into
sleeve (6). 
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 6
characterised in that means of locking (8) is

produced in the form of an elastic ring.
Prosthesis as claimed in claim 9
characterised in that, in the position where ring (8)

co-operates with recess (5a), its average diameter is
equal to or greater than the outside diameter of the

rod.
