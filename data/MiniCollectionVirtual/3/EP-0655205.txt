<ABSTRACT>
In a pressure-operated press, two plungers which are nested one inside the other are used in a cylinder housing. The one plunger serves as a beading plunger to fix an eyelet in a punched-out hole in a web. Located in this beading plunger is an internal cylinder in which the second inner plunger is arranged. The latter serves as a cutting plunger to punch the hole in the web before the eyelet is set. In order to carry out the hole-punching and eyelet-setting in a particularly efficient manner, it is proposed to provide the beading plunger with a plunger head which is sealed off in the cylinder housing and by means of which the pressure space in the cylinder housing is divided into two separate part space. The front space thus produced in the front region of the plunger head is provided with a first pressure-medium line while a second independent pressure-medium line ends in a rod space located below the plunger head. Only this second pressure-medium line is connected to the internal cylinder in the beading plunger. The cutting plunger can be provided with a head region which is guided so as to be sealed off in the internal cylinder in the beading plunger. This allows control of the pressure medium, said control being connected in both pressure-medium lines and actively causing the working stroke as well as the return stroke of the beading plunger. The pressure relief valve can only be switched into the second pressure-medium line connected to the internal cylinder and only for a limited time during the working stroke. This has a pressure-increasing effect only on the cutting plunger.

A pressure fluid-operated press, in particular a hydraulic eye
press, for punching holes in webs (41) and for flange-fixing eyes (40)

which strengthen the cut-out hole (44) at the edge (46),

   comprising a cylinder housing (10) with two pistons (20; 30) which
are nested one within the other, namely

   with an outer piston which performs the flanging operation on the
eye (40), namely a flanging piston (20)


which at one end has in the cylinder housing (10) a pressure chamber
with a pressure fluid conduit and which at the other end carries the

flanging tool for the eye (40),

   with an inner piston which performs the hole-punching operation on
the web (41), namely a cutting piston (30)
which is guided in an inner cylinder (23) disposed in the interior
of the flanging piston (20) and which with its outwardly projecting

piston rod (34) actuates a cutting tool (31) for the web (41),

   with a pressure fluid control (50) for the flanging piston (20), and

   with a pressure limiting valve (55),

   characterised in that
the flanging piston (20) has a piston head (25) which is sealed in
the cylinder housing (10) and which divides the pressure chamber into two

mutually separate chamber portions (15, 16),
namely into an end chamber (15) which is disposed in front of the
end region of the piston head (25) and which has a first pressure fluid

conduit (13), and a rod chamber (16) which is disposed in the rod region
of the flanging piston (20) and which has a second pressure fluid conduit

(14),

   wherein only the second pressure fluid conduit (14) is communicated
by way of the rod chamber (16) with the inner cylinder (23) in the

flanging piston (20)
and the cutting piston (30) has a head region (33) guided in sealed
relationship in the inner cylinder (23) of the flanging piston (20), 
in the working stroke (29) of the flanging piston (20) the first
pressure fluid conduit (13) is admittedly connected to the pressure fluid

feed conduit (18) and the flanging piston (20) thereby entrains the
cutting piston (30),
but in that case at times a pressure limiting valve (55) is
connected into the communication between the second pressure fluid conduit

(14) and the pressure fluid discharge conduit (19), which results in a
build-up in pressure in the inner cylinder (23) and causes an independent

leading working stroke (29) of the cutting piston (30),
and in the return stroke (59) of the flanging piston (20) the first
pressure fluid conduit (13) is connected to the pressure fluid discharge

conduit (19) and the second pressure fluid conduit (14) is connected to
the pressure fluid feed conduit (18), the flanging piston (20) entraining

the cutting piston (30).
A press according to claim 1 characterised in that the time-limited
intervention of the pressure limiting valve (55) is derived from

the stroke travel (29) of the flanging piston (20).
A press according to claim 2 characterised in that a triggering
member (26) is connected to the flanging piston (20) and a switch (28)

responsive to the movement therepast of the triggering member (26) is
stationarily positioned in the path of movement of the triggering member

(26) which moves with the flanging piston and in the response situation
the switch (28) sets the pressure limiting valve (55) in operation.
A press according to claim 3 characterised in that the switch
(28) is operative only during the working stroke (29) but not during the

return stroke (58) of the flanging piston (20).
A press according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in that the
response duration of the switch (28) is determined by its response

distance (65) in the path of movement of the triggering member (26) and
the speed of the triggering member (26) on moving therepast. 
A press according to one or more of claims 3 to 5 characterised
in that in the response situation the switch (28) outputs an electrical

signal to the pressure limiting valve (5) by way of an active line (58).
A press according to one or more of claims 2 to 6 characterised
in that a switching bar (27) provided at least with one switching

projection (26) is connected to the flanging piston (20) and faces in the
direction of stroke movement (29, 59) of the flanging piston (20) while

the electrical switch which is in the form of a solenoid switch (28) is
arranged at a defined height relative to the cylinder housing (10).
A press according to claim 7 characterised in that the switching
bar (27) is longitudinally slidably received in a stationary axial guide

(57) and serves as anti-twist means for the flanging piston (20).
A press according to one or more of claims 3 to 8 characterised
in that the switch (28) acts on an auxiliary control member (54) which is

only switched into the second pressure fluid conduit (14) and the
auxiliary control member (54) normally provides for a through flow of the

pressure fluid with a control portion (54'),

but in the response situation the auxiliary control member (54)
provides with a control portion (54'') for blocking the pressure fluid in

the second pressure fluid conduit (14),
and the pressure limiting valve (55) is arranged parallel to the
auxiliary control member (54) in a by-pass (56) in relation to the

pressure fluid conduit (14).
A press according to one or more of claims 1 to 9 characterised
in that a limit switch (66) which is responsive to the end of the working

stroke (28) acts on a main control member (53) and in the response
situation moves same out of a rest position in which the second 
conduit
(14) serves for the pressure fluid feed and the first conduit (13) serves

for the pressure fluid discharge, into a working position where the
above-stated functions of the two pressure fluid conduits (13, 14) are

mutually interchanged. 
A press according to claim 10 characterised in that the limit
switch is in the form of a pressure switch (66) which responds to a given

adjustable limit pressure in the end chamber (15) of the cylinder housing
(10) and changes over the main control member (53) from its rest position

into the working position by way of an electrical control signal
(electrical active line 58).
A press according to one or more of claims 1 to 11 characterised
in that two pumps (38', 38'') preferably drivable by a common motor (39)

serve as the pressure fluid source of the pressure fluid controls (50),
more specifically a high pressure pump (38'') with a small delivery

capacity on the one hand and a low pressure pump (38') with a high
delivery capacity on the other hand.
