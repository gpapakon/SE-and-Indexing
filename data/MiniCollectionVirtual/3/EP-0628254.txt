<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce frozen confectionery articles which are coated with particulate substances, chilled frozen portions are precoated with a liquid fatty composition and are then coated with crumbly dry particles. The particles are recycled without them breaking up by means of a vibrating screw conveyor (elevator, lift).

Process for producing ice confectionery articles
coated with a dry particulate material, particularly

in the form of flakes, characterized in that the
frozen ice portion is pre-coated at least on its upper

face and on its sides with a liquid fatty coating,
that the still soft fatty surface is uniformly covered

with particulate material by surrounding the ice
portion with a bed of solid particulate material,

accompanied by cooling, that the articles on which the
solid particulate material has adhered are separated

from the free solid particulate material and that the
substantially unbroken particulate material is

recycled so as to be re-used.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that,
before it is recycled, the particulate material is

freed from the fines which it is capable of containing
by screening.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the portions and the particulate material are coated

with a liquid fatty composition so as to cover the
upper face, the sides and the heel of the articles.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the particulate material is recycled by means of a

vibrating-screw elevator.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the particulate coating material is constituted by

flakes of cereals, particularly of rice which are
present in the form of toasted petals.
Apparatus for producing ice confectionery articles
coated with a solid particulate material, particularly

in the form of flakes, characterized in that it
comprises: 


a unit for pre-coating the upper face and the sides of
the ice portions with a liquid fatty composition,
a unit for coating with particles comprising means for
discharging a bed of particles surrounding the upper

face and the sides of the ice portions covered with
fatty composition, means for separating and recirculating

the surplus particles and cooling means.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that
it further comprises a unit for final coating of the

ice portions with a liquid fatty composition.
Apparatus according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in
that the means for recirculating the particles

comprise a vibrating-screw elevator.
Coated article of ice confectionery, capable of being
produced by implementing the process according to one

of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it comprises a
co-extruded core of vanilla-flavoured ice cream and of

caramel, that the core is coated with toasted rice
flakes between two layers of milk chocolate coating on

its upper face and its sides, and with a heel of milk
chocolate coating.
