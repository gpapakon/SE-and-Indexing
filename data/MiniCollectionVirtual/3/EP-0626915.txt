<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to couplings for steering 
shafts and more particularly to couplings used in steering 
shafts with larger degrees of angular misalignment. US-A-3,926,069 discloses a breakaway universal joint 
assembly for a steering column which consists of a spider 
having four arms disposed in a cross-like configuration and 
a pair of yokes coupled to opposed arms of the spider. 
FR-A-2,515,129 teaches a coupling for two non-aligned 
sections of a steering column, each section having a pivot 
bolt carried in a fork. A central body with two recesses 
having perpendicular axes connects the two sections using 
rigid dowels. Steering shafts are frequently made using two shaft members 
connected by a rubber coupling. The rubber coupling 
provides axial and torsional dampening. As the angular misalignment between the two shaft members 
increases, the bending stress on the rubber coupling 
increases. This increases the fatigue on the rubber 
coupling and reduces its effective lifetime. US-A-3,926,069 discloses a steering column lower shaft 
assembly according to the pre-characterising clause of 
claim 1, with a rigid cross member. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
steering lower shaft assembly coupling of the type having 
a lower shaft member and an upper shaft member, the 
coupling having an axis of rotation, a cross member and a  
 
pair of connecting means for pivotally connecting the upper 
shaft member and the lower shaft member to the cross 
member, characterised in that said cross member is a 
flexible elastomeric cross member. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:-  
 
FIG. 1 is a simplified view of a steering shaft assembly 
incorporating the present invention; FIG. 2 is a plan view illustrating the steering lower 
shaft assembly coupling shown in FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a side view of the steering lower shaft 
assembly coupling shown in FIG. 2; FIG. 4 is a plan view illustrating a second embodiment of 
a steering shaft lower assembly coupling of the present 
invention; and FIG. 5 is a side view of the steering lower shaft 
assembly coupling shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 1 shows a steering column comprising an upper shaft 
31 and a lower shaft 30. The lower shaft 30 is connected to 
a steering box 1. A steering wheel 9 is connected to the 
upper shaft 31. The upper shaft 31 is supported by one or 
more bearings 5. The upper
