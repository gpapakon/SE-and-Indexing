<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds, some of which are novel, 
and to their anticonvulsant, sedative and neuroprotective properties. Compounds which possess anticonvulsant, antihypoxic or N-methyl-(d)-aspartate 
(NMDA) blocking properties are useful in the treatment and/or prevention of neuro-degeneration 
in pathological conditions such as stroke, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral 
palsy, hypoglycaemia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Olivo-pontocerebellar 
atrophy, perinatal asphyxia and anoxia. It has now been discovered that many 
substituted arylalkyl-amines and -amides possess anticonvulsant and neuroprotective 
properties which are useful for the treatment of such disorders. Many of these compounds 
also possess sedative properties. Niemers et al [Synthesis, 9, 593-595 (1976)] disclose 1-phenyl-2-(2-pyridinyl)ethylamine. 
However, neither separation of its enantiomers nor particular salts are 
mentioned. According to the invention we provide the use of a compound of formula I, 
   wherein,
 
   Ar₁ and Ar₂, which may be the same or different, 
independently represent phenyl substituted by one or more 
of amino, nitro, chlorine, bromine, hydroxy, C1 to 6 
alkoxy, C1 to 6 alkyl or cyano; in addition one of Ar₁ or 
Ar₂ may also represent phenyl;
 
   R₁ represents hydrogen or C1 to 6 alkyl;
 
   R₂ represents hydrogen or COCH₂NH₂;
 
   R₃ represents hydrogen or C1 to 6 alkyl;
 
   provided that when R₂ represents hydrogen, then one 
or both of Ar₁ and Ar₂ may also represent phenyl, 
fluorophenyl or 2-, 3- or 4- pyridinyl and R₁ may also 
represent C1 to 6 alkoxycarbonyl or trifluoromethyl;
 
   or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. This invention also relates to all stereoisomeric 
forms, optical enantiomeric forms and pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula 
I. The compounds of formula I possess useful anticonvulsant 
properties as demonstrated by their ability to 
inhibit maximal electroshock (MES) induced seizures in 
mice. The compounds of formula I also possess antihypoxia 
activity as demonstrated by their ability to increase the 
survival time of mice in an oxygen depleted environment. 
In addition, compounds of formula I inhibit the onset of  
 
convulsions and death induced by administration of 
N-methyl-(d)-aspartate (NMDA) to mice. Some of the compounds of formula I are known compounds 
and are commercially available. Compounds of formula I in 
which R₂ represents hydrogen may be prepared by known 
procedures for
