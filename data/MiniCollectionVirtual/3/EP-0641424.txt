<ABSTRACT>
A method of protecting a welded joint (7) between two weight-coated metal pipelines (1, 2) comprises positioning a wraparound sheet steel mould (8) around the joint, retaining that mould around the joint using a wraparound heat shrinkable fabric sleeve (9) with high tear strength, and filling the mould (8) with a corrosion resistant mastic (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
Protection of Pipe Joints DescriptionThis invention relates to the protection of joints in elongate substrates and more particularly to the protection of welded joints in submerged, weight-coated pipelines.Submerged weight-coated pipelines are usually installed by a purpose- built offshore vessel known as a laybarge. In a typical operation, twelve metre long steel pipes are coated onshore with an anti-corrosion coating, for example, coal tar enamel, asphalt, or a fusion-bonded epoxy coating, leaving a bare section at each end of the pipe to allow subsequent welding of adjacent lengths to take place without contamination or coating damage. This bare area normally extends up to 250 mm from each end of the pipe. In the next stage, the weight coating, which is usually a mixture of concrete and iron oxide, is applied over the anti-corrosion coating to a thickness of from about 25 mm to about 150 mm, depending upon the degree of negative buoyancy required. The weight coating is also cut-back from the pipe ends to expose the bare section of pipe and about 200 mm of the anti-corrosion coating, in order to allow subsequent overlap and completion of weld area corrosion protection.On the laybarge the coated pipes are strung together, aligned, welded, and the welds x-ray inspected. An anti-corrosion layer is then applied over the welded region which may, for example be a sealant-coated tape, or a heat- shrinkable wraparound sleeve. Finally the joint area is mechanically protected, to restore the weight coating at the joint, and to protect the joint from mechanical damage during subsequent operations.Typically the laybarge is divided into a number of work stations each carrying-out a specific function at a pipe joint area. The completed pipeline leaves the rear of the laybarge and encounters a series of rollers and guides which assist, correct and control entry of the pipeline into the sea, river or lake. This collection of rollers and guides, known as the stinger, is towed along by the laybarge and is subjected to any sea movements or wave impacts, hence the pipeline supported by the stinger is itself buffeted about and impacts with the rollers and guides, particularly in rough weather. Such impacts can be severe and could result in damage to the joint area weight 

coating and exposed anti-corrosion coating if no mechanical protection system were to be employed.Owing to the high cost of operating a fully equipped laybarge all operation must be carried-out quickly and efficiently, with no single station taking more

Claims
1. A method of protecting a joint between two corrodible, weight coated elongate substrates which have been bared of weight coating in the joint region, comprising (a) positioning a wraparound mould around the joint region, and (b) filling the mould with a corrosion resistant material, characterised by a positioning wraparound sleeve around the mould, and engaging the sleeve around the mould substantially to retain the mould within the sleeve.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the wraparound sleeve has a tear strength of at least 20 N preferably at least 30 N, especially at least 50 N, more especially at least 100 N when tested in an Instron tensometer employing a draw rate of 100 mm mm at 25°C.
3. A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the wraparound sleeve has a tear strength of at least 20 N preferably at least 30 N, especially at least 50 N, more especially at least 100 N when tested in an Instron tensometer employing a draw rate of 100 mm/mm at 180°C or at 200°C or at 250°C.
4. A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the wraparound sleeve has a tear strength of at least 300N/25mm, preferably at least 400N/25mm, especially at least 500N/25mm at 25°C.
5. A method according to any preceding claim wherein the wraparound sleeve has a tear strength of at least 300N/25mm, preferably at least 400N/25mm, especially at least 500N/25mm at 180°C, or at 200°C or at 250°C.
6. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the wraparound sleeve is heat-recoverable, preferably radially heat shrinkable.
7. A method according to claim 6, wherein the wraparound sleeve comprises a recoverable fabric.
8. A method according to any preceding claim wherein the mould comprises a wrapped metal sheet. 


9. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the mould is metal, and retention of the mould by the sleeve does not prevent corrosion of the mould.
10. A method according to any preceding claim where the corrosion resistant material used to fill the mould is a marine mastic.
11. A method according to claim 10, wherein the marine mastic is poured into the mould at a temperature of at least 180°C.
