<ABSTRACT>
A chromatographic purification and separation process for mixtures of nucleic acids is disclosed. The nucleic acids to be separated and purified are adsorbed on a substrate from a solution which has a high salt concentration (ionic strength) and/or a high alcohol concentration, then desorption of the substrate is carried out by means of a solution with low salt concentration (ionic strength). The process is characterised in that the mixture of nucleic acids is adsorbed on a porous or non-porous mineral substrate made of metal oxides and/or mixed metal oxides, silica gel, materials composed mainly of glass, aluminium oxide, zeolithes, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide. The mixture of nucleic acids is adsorbed on the substrate from an aqueous adsorption solution with a high salt concentration (ionic strength) and with 1 to 50 % by volume aliphatic alcohol with a 1 to 5 carbon atoms long chain, and/or polyethylene glycols (PEG) and/or hydrophobic, inorganic and/or organic polymers and/or organic acids, such as trichloracetic acid (TCA). If required, the mixture of nucleic acids is then washed with a washing solution, eluted with a solution having a lower salt concentration (ionic strength) and the thus obtained nucleic acid or nucleic acid fraction is collected.
