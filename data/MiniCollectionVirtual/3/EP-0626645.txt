<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, a structure for holding broken select lines
in a memory array deselected addresses the prior art problems associated with floating

broken select lines, such as standby current and disruption of attached memory cells.
The structure is a high impedance device which is placed on the end of select lines so

that if a select line is broken during fabrication, the high impedance device will hold
the broken end of the select line to the desired deselect voltage. Select lines which

have a driver at one end only and are broken during fabrication, but have the high
impedance device on the other end, are not allowed to float. The high impedance

device is also suitable for select lines which are not broken and previously were
anchored at just one end. Suitable high impedance devices include a reverse biased

diode, a weak transistor, a poly R memory cell load device, and an ON or OFF TFT
memory cell load device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit memory devices, 
and more specifically to a structure for deselecting broken select lines in memory 
arrays. Many memory devices with a redundancy scheme have broken select lines in 
the memory array. Memory devices that commonly employ broken select lines include 
static random access memories (SRAMs), erasable programmable read only memories 
(EPROMs), electrically erasable read only memories (EEPROMs), Flash EEPROMs, and 
other specialty memory devices such as tag RAMs and Zeropower® devices. A recent 
trend in the memory device field is to use more redundancy as the density of such 
devices increases. As the density of memory devices having broken select lines 
increases, problems associated with these broken select lines increase as well. In SRAM technology, the select lines for a memory array are connected to a 
large number of memory cells, or local row decoders, in the array. Typical select lines  
 
may include a row line, a master row line, a word line, or an X-Line. These lines 
select, in a parallel fashion, the memory cells or local row decoders necessary to 
access a particular portion of the memory array. When that portion of the memory 
array is not to be selected, the select lines are held in a deselect state to disable all 
connected cells or local row decoders. In the DRAM prior art, word select lines perform the same function as outlined 
above. Word lines are held at a low logic level at both ends by devices, often called 
holding devices, which are capable of maintaining this low logic level on unselected 
word lines in the presence of strong capacitive coupling from a selected word line and 
from bit lines - half or more of which have positive-going transitions during the cycle. 
DRAM row lines are high impedance such that a holding transistor placed on one end 
of the row line is not sufficient to hold the entire length of the row line in a deselected 
state. A quite word flip-flop or other deselect scheme is often used to provide 
clamping means which prevent bouncing of word lines or row lines. Later 
improvements in the development of DRAMs provided precharge, such as Vcc/2, that 
balances this coupling for selection, separation and equilibration of bitlines to the word 
lines, thus making holding devices less important. In contrast, traditionally the number of SRAM bit lines driven during any given 
cycle is small, so that problems are not encountered with coupling of these bit lines 
to the word lines in the
