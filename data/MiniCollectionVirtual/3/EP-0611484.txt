Process for producing a silicon-ferrosilicon
(Si/FeSi
2
) heterostructure for an electronic, optical
or optoelectronic module, more particularly a hetero-bipolar

transistor, waveguide, laser, infra-red
detector or photodiode, wherein


a) high-energy Fe ions are first of all implanted in
the silicon substrate (4, 5),
b) this structure is tempered at a temperature above
the transformation temperature T
u
 of the FeSi
2
 until
a continuous layer (4, 5) consisting of metallic α-FeSi
2

is produced in the silicon substrate,
c) this Si/FeSi
2
 heterostructure is tempered below
the transformation temperature T
u
 of the FeSi
2
 to form
the semiconducting FeSi
2
,

characterised in that
d) between the two said tempering stages, nuclei
destined for the nucleation and/or growth of the

semiconducting FeSi
2
 are formed in the region of the
α-FeSi
2
 layer (5) by means of the ion implantation of
Fe ions.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that ion implantation is employed
with an ion dosage below a level of 6 x 10
14
 Fe ions
per cm
2
 and is carried out at temperatures of up to
573 K (300 °C).
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that ion implantation is carried out 
with dosage levels of up to 6 x 10
14
 Fe ions per cm
2

and at temperatures within the range 4 K to 373 K,

more particularly at room temperature, thereby
selectively rendering the α-FeSi
2
 layer amorphous.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that the ion implantation is
employed selectively, more particularly to a

spatially limited extent, in the spatial zone of the
FeSi
2
 layer (4, 5).
Process according to claim 4,

characterised in that the selective ion implantation
involves the use of masks.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that the tempering of the silicon
structure (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) doped with high-energy Fe

ions is carried out at a temperature in the range
between 950°C and 1200°C, more particularly at

1150°C.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that the tempering of the silicon
structure (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) doped with high-energy Fe

ions takes place above the transformation temperature
T
u
 of the FeSi
2
 in the time range from 0.5 second to
60 minutes, more particularly 10 seconds.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that the tempering which takes place
below the transformation temperature T
u
 of the FeSi
2

to form the semiconducting FeSi
2
 is performed in the
time range from 1 second to 12 minutes, more

particularly 10 seconds.
