<DESCRIPTION>
HYDROXAMIC ACID DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS ANTI- INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDSThe present invention is concerned with novel hydroxamic acid derivatives having anti-inflammatory activity, with processes for their preparation, with pharmaceutical formulations containing said derivatives and with their use in medicine.European Patent Specification 0196184 describes hydroxamic acid derivatives having anti-inflammatory activity by virtue of their ability to inhibit the enzymes 5- lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase in the mammalian arachidonic acid cascade. The compounds in question include those of formulawherein:Ar is phenyl;Ar ' is phenylene;Y is C2-10 alkenylene;Rl is C]_4 alkyl, amino, C1- alkylamino, or di-Cι-4 alkylamino;and Ar and Ar' are optionally substituted by one or more substitutents independently selected from C\_4 alkyl (which may itself be optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms), C1- alkoxy, halo, nitro, amino, carboxy, Cι_4 alkoxycarbonyl and hydroxy.International patent application WO 90/12008 describes urea based lipoxygenase inhibiting compounds including those of formula
wherein:K\ is phenyl substituted by carbocyclic aryloxy optionally substituted by one, two, or three groups independently selected from halo, nitro, cyano, alkyl, alkoxy, and halosubstituted alkyl;X is C2-6 alkenylene; andR2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen, C\.β alkyl, and carbocyclic aryl.International patent application WO92/10469 describes hydroxamic acid derivatives, including those of formulawherein: 
B is aryl or aryl substituted with one or more substituents selected from a group including halo, cyano, aminocarbonyl, \. alkylaminocarbonyl, di C\.(_. alkylaminocarbonyl, and C\. alkylsulphonyl;A is alkynylene; andR] is hydrogen, C\__\ alkyl, or -NR2R3 (wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen and C 1-4 alkyl).International patent application WO92/01682 describes acetylene derivatives, including those of formulaOH A-C≡C-B-N-C(O)-Rι wherein:A is phenyl optionally substituted by phenoxy (optionally substituted by C\.(_, alkyl, Cι_6 haloalkyl, C\.β alkoxy, hydroxy or halogen); 

B is a bond or a straight or branched divalent C _ 2 alkylene group; andRl is hydrogen, C1-. 2 alkyl, C3-.8 cycloalkyl, or -NR2R3 (wherein R2and R3 are independently selected from hydrogen and Cμό alkyl) .A group of compounds, related to those described in EP 0196184, WO 92/10469, WO 92/01682, and WO 90/12008 has now been discovered which have use in the prophylaxis and treatement of clinical conditions
