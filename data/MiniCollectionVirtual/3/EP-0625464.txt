<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closing device on a packaging machine for steel-band ties, with an upper part which is located above the channel portion provided for forming the closure and which contains upper knives on punching rams, a clamping ram and a cutting-off knife, and with a lower part located underneath the channel portion and taking the form of a baseplate, to which lower knives aligned with the upper knives of the punching rams are fastened, the housing of the upper part being connected fixedly to the baseplate and being pivotable about an axis running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the tying channel, the pivot pin being at the same time the drive shaft 1 for driving all the parts of the closing device to be driven, and the upper knives 5, 6, 7 being driven by eccentrics having crank-and-rocker mechanisms.

Closure device for a packaging machine for steel band 
hoops, having an upper part lying above the channel portion 

provided for the formation of the closure, which upper part 
contains upper cutters (5, 6, 7) on stamping punches, a 

clamping punch (22) and a cut-off knife, and having a lower 
part lying under the channel portion and in the form of a 

base plate (8) on which lower cutters, which are aligned 
with the upper cutters (5, 6, 7) of the stamping punches, 

are fixed and the housing of the upper part is firmly 
connected to the base plate (8) and is pivotable about an 

axis (1) extending parallel to the longitudinal direction 
of the hoop channel, which axis is at the same time the 

drive shaft (1) for the drive of the punches containing the 
upper cutters, characterised in that the pivot axis (1) 

forms the drive shaft (1) for the drive of the pivot device 
of the closure device. 
Closure device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that linear reciprocating movements for driving the stamping, 

cut-off and clamping tools are derived from the drive shaft 
(1), serving as a pivot axis, by means of cams, crankshafts 

and connecting rods or eccentric discs (2, 3, 4) with 
rocker linkage. 
Closure device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the stamping (5, 6, 7), cut-off and clamping tools  

 
are connected to the eccentric discs (2, 3, 4) and to the 

rocker linkage in a form fit manner during the working stroke 
and during the return movement into the neutral position. 
Closure device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the eccentric discs (2, 3, 4) are disposed off-set by 

a particular rotational angle on the drive shaft (1), 
and during a rotation of the drive shaft (1) all upper 

cutters (5, 6, 7) and the clamp, which is fixed to an upper 
cutter, and the cut-off knife carry out a working stroke 

and a return stroke into the neutral position. 
Closure device according to claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that a toothed wheel (16) is fixed on the drive shaft 

(1), and engages with a second toothed wheel (17) of the 
same size or almost the same size, which lies under the 

drive shaft (1), and the second toothed wheel (17) is 
connected to a disc provided with a cam (18) and the cam 

(18) presses against the pivotable part (9) of the housing 
in the pivoted-out position against the force of a spring 

(20), opens it and holds it open. 
Closure device according to claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the pivotable part of the base plate (8) contains 

the lower cutters associated with the three upper cutters 
(5, 6, 7) and is of approximately the same size as the 

surface lying below the three upper cutters.  
 
Closure device according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that a clamping device, which lies at the side of the 

closure-forming parts, from which the packing band extends 
from the packed item to these parts, goes into the clamping 

position earlier than the first closure-forming part cuts 
in and, immediately after the clamping but still prior to 

the cutting in the tensioning device relaxes the packing 
band by means of slight reverse operation. 
Closure device according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that a clamping device which lies at the side of the 

closure-forming parts, from which the packing band extends 
from the packed item to these parts, goes into the clamping 

position earlier than the second closure-forming part in 
the sequence of operations cuts in and, immediately after 

clamping but still prior to the cutting in the tensioning 
device relaxes the packing band by means of a slight 

reverse operation.
