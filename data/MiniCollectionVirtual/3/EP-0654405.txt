<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of semi-automatic packaging 
of rod-shaped objects in cardboard boxes, the machine for its application 
and a special pre-cut cardboard blank used in the said method. The packaging of rod-shaped objects, such as extruded plastic 
sections, for example conduits for electrical cables or similar, is at 
present carried out by an essentially manual procedure, with a considerable 
waste of space, owing to the pre-folding necessary to prepare the packages 
for containing the material, and of time by the operators employed on the 
task in question. The object of the present invention is to provide a method enabling 
the operations of forming and closing the package to be automated as much 
as possible, thus yielding a considerable saving of space and time. A further object is to provide a machine with which this method can 
be applied, together with a pre-cut cardboard packaging blank suitable for 
use in the method according to the present invention. These objects are achieved by using an automatic packaging method 
comprising the phases of: folding into channel form the cardboard blank 
with the raising of the side walls; insertion of the material to be 
packaged; folding of the end walls of the blank; folding of the side tab 
and of the tabs of the end walls of the blank; deposition of a strip of 
adhesive material on these tabs; closing of the cover flap on the said tabs 
and removal of the package thus formed from the operating surface. Another object of the present invention is a pre-cut cardboard blank 
shaped so that it can be used in the application of the method according to 
the present invention, comprising: a base surface of essentially 
rectangular shape, two side walls connected to the longer sides of the base  
 
surface, a tab connected to one side wall and a cover flap connected to the 
opposite side wall; two end walls connected to the shorter sides of the 
base surface and two tabs on the further side of the end walls, 
characterized in that it has four connecting flaps located between the side 
walls and the end walls, the said connecting flaps being provided with 
facilitated folding lines along the diagonals connecting the free corner of 
each flap to that nearest the base of the blank. A further object of the present invention is a machine for the 
application of the method according to the present invention, comprising a 
frame for containing the cardboard blank, consisting of a support base and 
two side guards, the ends of the said containing

Method of semi-automatic packaging of rod-shaped objects in cardboard 
boxes comprising the phases of: folding into channel form a pre-cut 

cardboard blank (8), comprising a base (108), two side walls (208), one of 
which is provided with a cover flap (228) while the other is provided with 

a foldable tab (218), and two end walls (308 and 308') provided with 
foldable tabs (318); insertion into this channel of the material to be 

packaged; folding of the end walls (308 and 308') of the blank; folding of 
the tab (218) of the side wall (208) and of the tabs (318) of the end walls 

(308 and 308') of the blank; deposition of the strip of adhesive material 
(606) on these tabs; closing of the cover flap (228) on the said tabs (218, 

318) and removal of the package thus formed. 
Pre-cut cardboard blank (8) shaped for use in the application of the 
method according to Claim 1, comprising: a base (108) of essentially 

rectangular shape, two side walls (208) connected to the longer sides of 
the base surface, a side tab (218) connected to one side wall (208) and a 

cover flap (228) connected to the opposite side wall; two end walls (308 
and 308') connected to the shorter sides of the base surface (108) and two 

tabs (318) on the farther side of the end walls, characterized in that it 
has four square connecting flaps (408 and 408') located between the side 

walls and the end walls, the said connecting flaps (408 and 408') being 
provided with facilitated folding lines (418 and 418') respectively along 

the diagonals connecting the free corner of each flap (408 and 408') to 
that nearest the base of the blank, and provided with cut-outs (428 and 

428') at the free corners. 
Machine for the application of the method according to Claim 1, 
comprising a supporting frame (2), a support base (4) for the cardboard 

blank (8) and two side guards (3, 3'), the ends of the said frame (2) being 
connected to means (5, 5') of folding the end walls (308 and 308') of the 

blank and means (105) of folding the tabs of the said end walls, and the 
side gua
rds (3, 3') being connected to means (103) of folding the tab (218)
