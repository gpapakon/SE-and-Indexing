<ABSTRACT>
In the fire control of a gun, for example an anti-aircraft gun, angular scanning of the aiming position of the gun is organised around an aiming position calculated in a known way by the fire control. The scanning is organised by taking into account each of the miss distances of the shells previously fired. The shells fired have to be equipped with a proximity fuse (2) and with means (2, 4, 5, 7, 8) for sending back signals to the fire control giving the miss distance directly or after processing.
