<ABSTRACT>
A drilling machine with a chassis, a mast (4), a crown sheave (23) mounted on the end of the mast (4) or a mast extension (5) and intended for an impact rope (7), and an impact device which contains a winch, in particular a free-fall winch, arranged on the chassis or on the mast (4) for the impact rope (7) and an impact mechanism (8) carried by the mast (4) and having a motor-driven crank (16) or another mechanical motion element for an impact-mechanism sheave (14). In this drilling machine, the impact mechanism (8) is a built-in part of the mast (4) or a mast extension (5) in such a way that the range of movement of the impact-mechanism sheave (14) lies partly within the outline contour of the mast (4) or the mast extension (5). In this arrangement there is a single deflection sheave (22), arranged in the mast (4) or a mast extension (5), for the impact rope (7). The latter is run directly to the crown sheave (23) via the deflection sheave (22).

Drilling machine with a chassis, a mast, a top roller mounted on the end
of the mast or of a mast extension for an impact cable and with an

impact device, which contains a winding drum, in particular a free-fall
drum, for the impact cable arranged on the chassis or on the mast and an

impacting mechanism carried by the mast with a motor-driven crank or
other mechanical operating member for an impact-mechanism roller,

characterised by the following features:

the impact mechanism (8) is an inbuilt component of the mast
(4) or mast extension (5), in such a way that the range of

movement (B) of the impact mechanism roller (14) lies
partially within the envelope outline of the mast (4) or mast

extension (5),
there is present in the mast (4) or in the mast extension (5) a
single direction- reversing roller (22) for the impact cable (7),

over which the latter is guided directly to the head roller (23).
Drilling machine according to Claim 1, characterised by a direct drive
(19) for the crank (16) of the impact mechanism (8).
Drilling machine according to Claim 2, that a free-wheel mechanism
(21) provided in the torque transmission path from the direct drive to the

crank (16) is arranged directly on the output shaft (20) of a driving
motor (19).
Drilling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the head of
the mast is arranged transversely and has two rollers for a second cable,

characterised in that a single head roller (23) for the impact cable (7) is
arranged parallel to a roller (10b) for the second cable (11).
