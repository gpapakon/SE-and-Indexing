<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of inhibitors of an enzyme in the
therapy, in particular in the treatment of atherosclerosis. The present invention
also relates to the isolation and purification of the enzyme, to isolated nucleic
acids encoding the enzyme, to recombinant host cells transformed with DNA
encoding the enzyme, to the use of the enzyme in diagnosing a patient's
susceptibility to atherosclerosis, and to the use of the enzyme in identifying
compounds which are potentially useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis.Lipoprotein Associated Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), also previously
known in the art as Platelet Activating Factor Acetyl Hydrolase (PAF acetyl
hydrolase). During the conversion of LDL to its oxidised form, Lp-PLA2 is
responsible for hydrolysing the sn-2 ester of oxidatively modified
phosphatidylcholine to give lyso-phosphatidylcholine and an oxidatively modified
fatty acid. Both of these products of Lp-PLA2 action are potent chemoattractants
for circulating monocytes. As such, this enzyme is thought to be responsible for
the accumulation of cells loaded with cholesterol ester in the arteries, causing the
characteristic 'fatty streak' associated with the early stages of atherosclerosis.
Inhibition of the Lp-PLA2 enzyme would therefore be expected to stop the build
up of this fatty streak (by inhibition of the formation of lysophosphatidylcholine),
and so be useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis. In addition, it is proposed that
Lp-PLA2 plays a direct role in LDL oxidation. This is due to the poly unsaturated
fatty acid-derived lipid peroxide products of Lp-PLA2 action contributing to and
enhancing the overall oxidative process. In keeping with this idea, Lp-PLA2
inhibitors inhibit LDL oxidation. Lp-PLA2 inhibitors may therefore have a
general application in any disorder that involves lipid peroxidation in conjunction
with the enzyme activity, for example in addition to conditions such as
atherosclerosis and diabetes other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, stroke,
myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury and acute and chronic inflammation.The present invention therefore provides in a first aspect an inhibitor of the
enzyme lipoprotein associated Lp-PLA2 for use in therapy, in particular in the
treatment of atherosclerosis. In a preferred aspect the invention provides for the
use of an inhibitor in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of
atherosclerosis, diabetes and other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, stroke,
myocardial infarction,
