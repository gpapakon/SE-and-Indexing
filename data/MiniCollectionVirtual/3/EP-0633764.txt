<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to skin care methods and
compositions.These are intended for the treatment or prevention of dry
skin conditions and particularly conditions wherein flaky
skin cells occur on the surface of the skin. The
composition may also be used to alleviate acne or dandruff.In normal healthy skin there is an imperceptible shedding
of peripheral corneocytes, to be replaced by lower level
corneocytes, a process named desquamation. This occurs by
the breakdown of the cohesive forces binding the peripheral
corneocytes. One of the main cohesive elements is the
rivet-like desmosome which is a protein complex comprising
glycoproteins anchored in the membrane, responsible for
corneocyte-corneocyte adhesion. To enable desquamation to
occur these glycoproteins have to be degraded by the action
of specific proteases.Under certain circumstances there is an aberrant breakdown
of the desmosomes in the peripheral corneocytes leading to
the dry-flaky skin condition. This has been demonstrated
by retention of desmosomal structures and the desmosomal
glycoprotein desmoglein (dg1) in the surface layer of
stratum corneum, where in normal skin these cannot be
readily detected.Walsh et al in a paper presented to the British Society of
Dermatology in May 1990 have suggested that the
oligosaccharide chains of the stratum corneum desmosomal
glycoproteins may protect the proteins from proteolytic 
degradation and that prior treatment with glycosidases, to
remove the sugar side chains, may be required before the
proteases can breakdown the adhesive proteins.According to the invention there is provided a cosmetic
method for the treatment of dry skin conditions which
includes the topical application to the skin of a
composition comprising:
(1) from 0.001 to 20% by weight of a glycosidase;(2) from 0.001 to 20% by weight of a protease; and
a cosmetically acceptable vehicle therefore;
the components (1) and (2) being present simultaneously in
the composition or being applied separately, component (1)
being applied before component (2).The compositions may be formulated in any conventional
manner and include conventional vehicles, adjuncts and
additives. The concentration of each component for use according to the
method of the invention is of the order of 0.00001 to 50%
by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.001 to 20%
and most preferably 0.1 to 10%.Preferably component 1 will be applied to the skin or be
present in the composition in amounts greater than component
2 in a preferred ratio of between 100:1 and 1:1.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of dry skin
conditions

excluding methods for treatment of the human or animal body by
surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human

or animal body
which includes the topical application to

the skin of a composition comprising:

(1) from 0.001 to 20% by weight of a glycosidase;
(2) from 0.001 to 20% by weight of a protease; and

a cosmetically acceptable vehicle therefore;

the components (1) and (2) being present simultaneously
in the composition or being applied separately,

component (1) being applied before component (2).
A method according to claim 1 wherein the ratio of
component (1) to component (2) in the composition is in

the range from 100:1 to 1:1.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
composition additionally comprises a lipase.
Use of a glycosidase (component (1)), a protease
(component (2)) and a cosmetically acceptable vehicle

therefore for the preparation of a composition for
topical application to the skin for treatment of dry

skin conditions; component (2) to be applied
simultaneously with or after component (1).
