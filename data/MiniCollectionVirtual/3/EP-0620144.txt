<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-skid brake
system of a vehicle which suppresses an excessive braking
force acting on vehicle wheels to accomplish a efficient
braking action, in particular, to a pressure reduction control
just after an anti-skid brake control (Hereinafter
referred to as ABS control) starts.As a vehicle brake system, there has been known an
anti-skid brake system in which a wheel lock or wheel skid is
prevented under a braking condition of the vehicle. The anti-skid
brake system is provided with wheel speed sensors for
sensing rotation speed of four wheels of the vehicle respectively,
magnetic control valves for controlling a brake oil
pressure, controller for controlling the operation of the
control valves. The controller calculates an acceleration or
deceleration of the wheels based on the wheel speeds detected
and reduces a brake pressure of hydraulic fluid in the
control system by controlling the magnetic valves when the
acceleration or deceleration of the wheel rotation is lower
than a predetermined value, and increase the brake pressure
by controlling the magnetic valves when the wheel rotation
is restored as a result of the brake pressure reduction
according to the anti-skid control and when the acceleration 
or the deceleration is increased beyond a predetermined
value. The above anti-skid brake control includes a pressure
increase phase, increased pressure hold phase, pressure reduction
phase and reduced pressure hold phase in a control
cycle, or simply includes the pressure increase phase and
pressure reduction phase in the one control cycle. Namely,
the ABS control is made to cyclically execute the above
phases until the vehicle is stopped. The ABS control is
advantageous in that the wheel lock or wheel skid can be
effectively suppressed even under an abrupt braking action to
stop the vehicle with a short braking distance and with a
stable steering.Japanese Patent publication 50-32709 reduces the brake
pressure when Vw =<S*V+k*WG wherein the wheel speed is Vw,
the vehicle speed is V, the wheel deceleration WG, slip ratio
(Vw/V) is S, a predetermined constant is k.Generally, the brake pressure reduction is made in a
manner of repeating a plurality of intermittent pressure
reduction action each lasting several millisecond. The amount
of the pressure reduction of each action is determined based
on the slip ratio and the wheel deceleration. Thus, the
pressure reduction amount in the first control cycle in the
ABS control as well as the second or after control cycle is
deter
