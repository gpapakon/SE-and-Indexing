<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a mating 
modular element drawer construction for making 

quickly-assembled drawer assemblies, comprising 
at least an angular joint (6) for coupling two side 

elements (2,3,4) connected to one another by the angular 
joint, with expansion affixing means which are 

engaged in at least a seat (7) correspondingly 
defined on the side of the side element facing 

the angular joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular 
drawer construction for making quickly-assembled 
drawer assemblies. As is known, the drawers for drawer assemblies 
and the like usually comprise four side 
elements, of which one constitutes the front element, 
and a bottom which are associated with 
one another by glueing, screw connections, fitting 
connections, or by coupling methods providing 
a combination of the above mentioned connection 
methods. In making drawers, one of the operations 
which requires a lot of time and accordingly affects 
the final making cost, is the assembling 
together of the side elements. In some types of drawers, in which as side 
elements there are used light alloy section members, 
the connection between these elements is 
performed by using angular joints, which are 
conventionally coupled to the two side elements 
by means of screws, which involves a comparatively 
long assembling time. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention  
 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks 
by providing a drawer construction which 
can be simply and quickly assembled. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is 
to provide a drawer construction which, owing to 
its reduced assembling time, has a production 
cost which is much smaller than that of conventional 
drawers. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a drawer construction in which 
the side elements of the drawer can be easily 
connected to one another with a high accuracy. A further object of the present invention 
is to provide such a drawer construction which 
has a very high mechanical strength and duration. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become 
more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a 
mating modular element drawer construction for 
making quickly-assembled drawer assemblies and 
the like, characterized in that said drawer construction 
comprises at least an angular joint,  
 
connecting to one another two side elements of 
said drawer construction and including, on at 
least a side thereof facing one of said two side 
elements, expansion connecting means, engaged in 
at least a seat correspondingly defined on a 
side of said side element facing said angular 
joint. Further characteristics and advantages of 
the drawer construction according to the present 
invention will become more apparent from the 
following detailed description of a preferred 
embodi

<CLAIMS>
A mating modular element drawer construction 
for making quickly-assembled drawer 

assemblies and the like, characterized in that said 
drawer construction comprises at least an angular 

joint, connecting to one another two side 
elements of said drawer construction and including, 

on at least a side thereof facing one of 
said two side elements, expansion connecting 

means, engaged in at least a seat correspondingly 
defined on a side of said side element 

facing said angular joint. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said expansion connecting 

means comprise at least a pin having a pin 
body formed by resiliently flexible lugs and a 

punch element which can be introduced, through a 
passage substantially coaxial with said pin, 

from a side of said angular joint opposite to a 
side thereof supporting said pin, for causing 

said lugs to be bent away from said pin, for engaging 
said lugs with the sidewalls of the seat 

defined in said side element. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that said pin, seat and 

 
punch element have a polygonal cross-section. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that said punch element is 

provided, along a side surface thereof, with expanded 
portions engaging between the lugs forming 

said pin. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said angular joint is 

provided, on a side thereof facing said side element, 
with two pin elements each of which is 

engaged by expansion in a seat defined on an end 
portion of the side element facing the angular 

joint. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said side elements comprise 

section members. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 17 characterized in that on a side of said angular 

joint facing said side element there are 
provided abutment lugs engaging with an outer 

surface of said side element. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said angular joint supports 

a sliding wheel for allowing said drawer 
construction to slide. 
A drawer construction, according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that said angular joint is 

connected to the other of said two side elements, 
by means of screws.
