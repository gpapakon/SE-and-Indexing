<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cleaner dust bag has a substantially plate-shaped connection piece (4) with a fixed, two-layer base body and a closure slide (6) displaceable between the two base-body layers (7, 8). The base-body layers (7, 8) contain aligned passage openings (9, 10) and the closure slide (6) contains a through-opening (11) which coincides with the passage openings (9, 10) in the open position of the closure slide (6). In the closed position, the closure slide (6) closes the passage openings (9, 10). The base body has at least one stop element (21) which engages in a stop cutout (20) of the closure slide (6), the edge of the stop cutout (20) forming, at least in the closed position of the closure slide (6), a limit stop (23) which bears against the stop element (21).

Filter bag for vacuum cleaners with a substantially plate-shaped 
connecting piece (4; 4a) having a fixed base body (5; 5a) 

with two stacked base body layers (7, 8; 7a, 8a), in particular 
made of a card- or board-type material, with openings (9, 10; 9a, 

10a) in alignment with each other and a closing slide (6; 6a), 
in particular made of a foil-type flexible material, located 

between the two base body layers and having an aperture (11; 
11a), said closing slide projecting laterally between the base 

body layers and being movable from an open position in which its 
aperture is in alignment with the openings into a closed position 

blocking the openings, characterized in that the base body (5; 
5a) is provided with at least one stop element (21; 21a; 21'a) 

engaging a stop recess (20; 20a; 20'a) of the closing slide (6; 
6a), the edge of the recess forming at least in the closed 

position of the closing slide (6; 6a) an end stop (23; 23a) 
striking the stop element (21; 21a; 21'a). 
Filter bag according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
length of the at least one stop recess (20; 20a; 20'a) corresponds 

to the travel of the closing slide (6; 6a), the edge of 
the recess forming an end stop (23; 23a or 24; 24a respectively) 

in either position of the closing slide (6; 6a). 
Filter bag according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the at least one stop recess (20a, 20'a) is a longitudinal slot. 
Filter bag according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
closing slide (6a) has a longitudinal slot (20a or 20'a respectively) 

at right angles to its direction of adjustment (16a) on 
each side of the aperture (11a), each longitudinal slot being 

associated with a stop element (21a or 21'a respectively) fitted 
to the base body (5a)  

 
Filter bag according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the stop recess (20) is formed by the aperture (11). 
Filter bag according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
stop element (21) engages the aperture (11) on its centre line 

extending in the direction of adjustment (16). 
Filter bag according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
stop element (21) is arranged in front of the openings (9, 10) 

of the base body layers (7, 8) in the closing direction (16). 
Filter bag according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the aperture (11) is enlarged with reference to the openings 

(9, 10) of the base body layers (7, 8) to take the at least 
one stop element (21). 
Filter bag according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the at least one stop element (21; 21a; 21'a) is formed 

by a stop tongue (25) integral with one of the base body layers 
and bent towards the other base body layer. 
Filler bag according to Claim 9, characterized in that the 
at least one stop tongue (25) is located on the base body layer 

(8; 8a) remote from the filter bag. 
Filter bag according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized in that 
the other base body layer (7; 7a) is provided with a recess (26) 

at the location of the stop tongue (25). 
Filter bag according to Claims 10 and 11, wherein the connecting 
piece is bonded to a bag wall with the base body layer 

adjacent to the bag wall, characterized in that the stop tongue 
(25) is also bonded to the bag wall (2).  

 
Filter bag according to any of Claims 9 to 12, characterized 
in that the stop tongue (25) faces in the direction opposite the 

direction of closing (16). 
Filter bag according to Claim 13, wherein a perforated sealing 
membrane made of a rubber-elastic material and having a smaller 

hole cross-section than the cross-section of the openings of 
the base body layers is provided between the two base body layers 

at the location of the openings, characterized in that the sealing 
membrane (27) is attached to the base body layer (7) with the 

recess (26) and crosses the recess (26) with an outer edge area 
(29), and in that the stop tongue (25) engages the outer edge 

area (29) of the sealing membrane from beneath, causing the closing 
slide area forming the end stop (23) to slide on top of the 

outer edge area (29) of the sealing membrane when the closing 
slide (6) located between the sealing membrane (27) and the base 

body layer (8) with the stop tongue (25) is moved into closed 
position.
