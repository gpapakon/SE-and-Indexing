<ABSTRACT>
Described is a yarn-drawing method in which yarn, in particular thermoplastic yarn, is drawn, at a controlled yarn temperature, in order to improve the properties of the yarn. The method can be used as part of a spinning process or as a subsequent finishing treatment. The invention calls for the temperature of the yarn-heating device to be controlled as a function of a yarn-tension signal derived in or after the drawing zone.
