<DESCRIPTION>
The administration of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) to patients is currently being
investigated for its therapeutic effect. The use of NO has a vasodilatory effect
on such patients and is particularly of importance in the case of newborns
having persistent pulmonary hypertension. In such cases, the administration of
NO has significantly increased the oxygen saturation in such infants.The function of the administration of NO has been fairly widely published and
typical articles appeared in The Lancet, Vol. 340, October 1992 at pages
818-820 entitled "Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of
the Newborn" and "Low-dose Inhalational Nitric Oxide in Persistent Pulmonary
Hypertension of the Newborn" and in Anesthesiology, Vol. 78, pgs. 413-416
(1993), entitled "Inhaled NO- the past, the present and the future".The actual administration of NO is generally carried out by its introduction into
the patient as a gas along with other normal inhalation gases given to breathe
the patient. Such commercially available supplies are provided in cylinders
under pressure and may be at pressures of about 14MPA (2000 psi) and consist of a
mixture of NO in nitrogen with a concentration of NO of between about
800-2000 ppm. As such, therefore, some means must be used to reduce the
pressure of the supply to acceptable levels for a patient and also to very
precisely meter the amount of the NO and nitrogen mixture so that the desired
concentration of NO is actually administered to the patient. Such administration
must also be added in sympathy with the respiration pattern of the patient.The concentration administered to a patient will vary according to the patient
and the need for the therapy but will generally include concentrations at or
lower than 150 ppm. There is, of course, a need for that concentration to be
precisely metered to the patient since an excess of NO can be harmful to the 
patient. In addition, the administration must be efficient in a timely manner in
that NO is oxidized in the presence of oxygen to nitrogen dioxide and which is a
toxic compound. Therefore, care in its administration is paramount.Current known methods of such administration, therefore have been limited
somewhat to clinical situations where attending personnel are qualified from a
technical sense to control the mixing and administration of the NO to a patient.
Such methods have included the use of a forced ventilation device, such as a
mechanical ventilator where a varying flow of breathing gas is delivered to the
patient as well
