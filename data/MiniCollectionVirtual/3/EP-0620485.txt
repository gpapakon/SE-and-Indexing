<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making 
photographic developer solutions, developer precursor 
compositions and to a method of silver halide 
development. The invention relates to the development of 
imagewise exposed photographic silver halide 
materials. Silver halide developing agents are reducing 
agents and their solutions tend to oxidise when in 
contact with the air. Developer formulations, 
therefore, usually contain one or more antioxidants or 
"preservatives" which become oxidised sacrificially in 
order to avoid oxidation of the developing agent. 
Examples of such compounds are alkali metal sulphites 
which are contained in most developers both black and 
white and colour and hydroxylamine compounds which are 
often present in colour developers. However, even with 
such preservatives being present, developer solutions 
are still oxidised by the air in a period of weeks. It 
is sometimes necessary to discard a developer solution 
not because it is exhausted by use but because it has 
oxidised in the air. Especially for situations where use of a 
photographic developer is spasmodic or intermittent, 
it would be desirable to be able to use a developer 
solution which did not oxidise in the air or to make 
the developer immediately before it is used. The present invention provides method for making a 
photographic silver halide developer composition,  
 
preferably immediately before use, by electrolysing an 
aqueous medium containing a developing agent precursor 
composition which forms or releases a silver halide 
developing agent at an electrode upon electrolysis. The developing agent precursor composition is 
stable to aerial oxidation. Colour office copiers which operate by employing 
a silver halide colour material will need less 
attention because the "developer" solution will 
effectively be much more stable. Colour processing machines which are used on 
demand and rarely operate continuously would also be 
able to benefit from a "developer" solution that is 
very stable. This would apply to both minilab 
processors and to colour print making machines 
designed for users who like to enlarge and crop their 
own pictures and for machines designed to make prints 
from Photo CD discs. The present method of producing developer 
solution on demand would be very efficient in "one 
shot" chemistry where a developer solution would be 
used once and then discarded. The exact amount of 
developer made on each occasion could be related to 
the amount of development that will be required. That
