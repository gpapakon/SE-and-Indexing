<ABSTRACT>
This is a semiconductor chip package configuration 
particularly suited for stacking. These described 

arrangement is especially adapted to be used with the so-called 
Lead-On-Chip type package. Each package is of 

minimum size, and provided with a thermal heat sink 
arranged with respect to the remainder of the package to 

balance the stresses induced in the package during 
fabrication. 
This is accomplished by placing a lead frame on the 
active face of the semiconductor chip, bonding the lead 

frame conductors (14) to respective input/output pads 
(24) on the active face of the chip, and molding an 

encapsulant (30) completely around five of the six sides of 
the chip but leaving a substantial portion of the sixth 

side unencapsulated. A heat sink (34) is affixed on the 
exposed, i.e. unencapsulated, portion of the sixth side 

of the chip. The heat sink is comprised of a metal 
capable of thermally conducting and dissipating waste 

heat away from the chip and is of a mass, thickness, and 
area to counterbalance stresses such, as bending 

stresses, introduced into the chip by the application of 
the lead frame and encapsulant to the chip. The heat 

sink can also employed as a ground plane to provide an 
electromagnetic shield when the chips are arranged in a 

stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lead bonded semiconductor chips. 
More particularly it relates to the so-called Lead-On-Chip 
(LOC) package configuration arranged in a stack and a method 
of creating the stack. Each package is created to be of 
minimum size, and provided with a thermal heat sink arranged 
with respect to the remainder of the package to balance the 
stresses in the package. Lead-On-Chip (LOC) packages are now well known to the 
semiconductor industry and are fully described in USP 
4,862,245 assigned to the same assignee as the present 
invention. Heat sinks have also been attached to the 
backside, i.e. the nonactive face, of semiconductor chips as 
shown in USP 3,922,712. USP 4,868,712 discloses a stack of 
semiconductor devices with heat sinks attached thereto. Circuits formed in semiconductor chips have, over the years, 
become small, fast and dense yet the demands of the users 
require still smaller, faster and denser configurations which 
impose unique package size and thermal conditions. This 
invention provides a still smaller size, than any now known to 
the prior art, with improved electrical and thermal 
characteristics.  An object of the present invention is to provide an ultra-thin 
package for a semiconductor chip, using LOC technology, which 
meets the size and thermal conditions presently required by 
the industry. This desirable result is accomplished by the 
encapsulation of a chip, with a plastic encapsulating 
material, on at least five of its six sides while attaching 
the heat sink directly to the sixth side of the chip. Furthermore, it is another object of the invention that the 
heat sink be designed to balance the stresses on the chip 
introduced by the application of the leads on the active chip 
face and the encapsulation. It is another object of the invention to provide a packaged 
semiconductor chip with improved mechanical and electrical 
performance. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a thinner 
semiconductor package with a heat sink that was previously 
obtained in the prior art. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a 
multiple semiconductor package arrangement with enhanced 
reliability due to improved stress balancing and heat 
extraction. These and other objects of the present invention are realized 
and provided by placing a lead frame, having reduced 
thickness conductors, over the active face of the 
semiconductor chip, bonding the lead frame conductors to 
respective input output pads on the active face, and molding
