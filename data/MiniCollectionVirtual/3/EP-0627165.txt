<ABSTRACT>
A composition for cockroach treatment composed of an 
effective amount of (1) a chemical insecticide selected from 

nitroguanidines and nitromethylenes and (2) an entomopathogenic 
fungus preferably a fungus selected from the 
Verticillium
 genus 
or the 
Paecilomyces
 genus or the 
Metarhizium
 genus. The 
chemical insecticide is applied at a site where cockroaches 

have been observed or are suspected to be present. The fungus 
need not be applied to the site where the cockroaches have been 

observed if the fungus is already present at that site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for exterminating
insects, particularly cockroaches and to compositions
useful in such extermination.A number of chemicals which kill insects at specific
concentrations are known. Specific examples of such chemicals
include cyfluthrin (disclosed e.g., in U.S. Patent 4,218,469),
propoxur (disclosed e.g., in U.S. Patent 3,111,539),
fenvalerate (disclosed e.g., in U.S. Patent 4,061,664),
isofenphos (disclosed e.g., in U.S. Patent 3,621,082),
cypermethrin (disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,024,163), and
1-(2-chloro-5-pyridyl methyl)-2-(nitro-imino)imidazolidine
(disclosed, e.g. in U.S. Patent 4,742,060).Certain microbials, specifically some entomophageous fungi
are known to be useful in exterminating insects such as
cockroaches when present in sufficiently high amounts. See,
for example, U.S. Patents 5,057,315 and 5,057,316.However, each of these known insecticides and fungi has
characteristics which make it commercially undesirable. For
example, many of the known chemicals and microbials must be
used at rates which are too high to be economically or
environmentally desirable. Known insecticides and microbials
are also often too slow acting to assure success in their
practical application with respect to cockroaches. The
effectiveness of many of the known insecticides and microbials
is dependent upon the specific environment in which they are
used and may, therefore, be detrimentally affected by
uncontrollable factors. It has now been found that when specific types of
chemicals and entomogenous fungi selected from specific species
are used in combination to treat a site infested with
cockroaches, unexpected synergism in cockroach control results.
When used in combination, the application rates of the chemical
can be substantially lower than those which would be used for
an individual chemical insecticide alone. The desired effects
of the combined chemical and fungus of the present invention
are seen in days rather than weeks. Such combinations make it
possible to achieve faster, much higher, more predictable and
more economical cockroach control.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
combination of a chemical agent and a biological material which
is an effective cockroach treatment.It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
composition which need not be used in large quantities to be
effective.It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
combination of a chemical agent and a biological agent which
provides significantly faster
