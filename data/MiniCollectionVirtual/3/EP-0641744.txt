<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for purifying waste water in a lake, pond, dam, river and the like by use of microorganisms carried on charcoal. 
A plurality of water collecting pipes (4) formed therein with a plurality of water holes (5) are provided on the bottom portion 

(1a) of the pond or the like covered thereover with non-water permeable members (2). Charcoal (12) carrying thereon microorganisms 
is spread all over the water collecting pipes (4) to thereby form a treatment layer (13). A gravel layer (15) is formed on the 

treatment layer (13). A storage tank (18) is provided, which has a pump (29) connected thereto with a reflux pipe (31) communicating 
with the upper portion of the pond (1). Water (1b) to be treated which is disposed on the bottom portion (1a) is collected 

through the treatment layer (13) from the water holes (5) by use of the pump (29), and discharged in the vicinity of the water surface 
through the water collecting pipes (4) and the reflux pipe (31). When duckweeds are generated in the vicinity of the water surface, 

the water (1b) to be treated in the upper portion of the water surface is discharged to the treatment layer (13) through the 
water holes (5) of the water collecting pipes (4) by use of the pump (29). When the water (1b) to be treated passes through the 

treatment layer (13), the duckweeds and the organic substances are decomposed by the microorganisms carried satisfactorily on 
inexpensive charcoal (12). A non-uniformity in concentration of the dissolved oxygen within the whole pond or the like is reduced, 

so that the purifying treatment can be effectively achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a purifier for purifying polluted water in a body of water, such as, 
a lake, a pond, a dam, a water reservoir, a river and an irrigation channel, by means of 
microorganisms retained by charcoal. Generally in a confined body of water where there is very little flow of the water and the 
water is stagnate for a long period of time, such as, a lake, a pond, a dam, a reservoir, downstream of 
a river and an irrigation channel, water-bloom and other algae are generated near the surface of the 
water where oxygen density is relatively high, while the remains of water- bloom, other algae and 
various living organisms decompose near the bottom of the water where oxygen density is low. As 
the decomposed remains accumulate on the bottom, pollution of the water progresses. Such 
pollution becomes prominent especially in summer, resulting in generation of a bad odor. In order to prevent water in an confined area from becoming polluted, various purifying 
methods exist, including one which calls for supplying oxygen to the upper and middle layers of an 
confined body of water by means of a fountain and agitating the water so that water-bloom and other 
algae, as well as organic sludge, are decomposed by oxidation, another which utilizes filtration 
equipment, and another which calls for installing near the confined body of water a device having a 
filler layer filled with porous ceramics or other similar materials to hold micro organisms and 
pumping the water to flow through the device while airing the filler layer in order to promote 
oxidation decomposition. A fountain or agitating the water, however, may be effective in case of a small body of 
confined water, such as an artificial pond in a park, but, it is extremely difficult to purify a large 
body of water, such as a lake or a dam, by means of oxidation decomposition carried out by 
microorganisms, by feeding oxygen thereto supplied by just a fountain or agitation of the water. 
Filtration equipment is also virtually ineffective, because it is not capable of separating soluble 
organic substance. On the other hand, a purification method using an aeration type device with a filler layer 
requires installation of a facility on land outside the body of water. This presents a problem 
particularly in case of a dam or a similar site, because the inclination of the shore is often too steep 
to allow installation of the facility. Furthermore, in cases where porous ceramics is used as the 
material of the filler layer, its maximum
