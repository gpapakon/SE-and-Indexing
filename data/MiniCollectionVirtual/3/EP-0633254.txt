<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
isoxazole derivatives having lipoxygenase inhibiting 
activity and cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, salts 
thereof, and medical use thereof. It is considered that leukotrienes produced by 
5-lipoxygenase from arachidonic acid and prostaglandins 
produced by cyclooxygenase from arachidonic acid are 
deeply concerned in a crisis of allergic asthma, allergic 
rhinitis, inflammation, etc. Consequently it is desired 
to inhibit both 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase in 
order to strongly and properly inhibit various allergic 
diseases, inflammations and other diseases. The 
development of a drug inhibiting both enzymes is 
earnestly desired. The present inventors have conducted a research 
in considering the foregoing problems in the background 
art, and found that novel isoxazole derivatives as  
 
indicated in the following formula (1) have an excellent 
lipoxygenase inhibiting activity and an excellent 
cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, and are useful as a 
drug. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. The present invention provides isoxazole 
derivatives represented by the general formula (1) or a 
salt thereof: 
[wherein R and R' are the same or different and each is a 
hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group 
or a halogen atom: m is 0 to 5; A is -NH-, -O- or a 
direct bond; B is -C(=Z)-NH-, -C(=Z)-(CH=CH)ℓ- or -CH=CH-(wherein 
Z is an oxygen or sulfur atom and ℓ is 0 to 2); 
X is a nitrogen or carbon atom; n is 0 to 3; and Y is a 
hydroxy group, a lower alkoxy group, a lower alkyl group, 
a lower alkoxycarbonyloxy group, a lower 
alkoxycarbonylmethyloxy group, a carboxylmethyloxy group, 
an amino acid residue which may have a protective group, 
a lower alkylcarbonyloxy group, a pyridylcarbonyloxy  
 
group, a dimethylaminophenylcarbonyloxy group or a di-loweralkyl 
phosphate residue; provided that when n is 2 
or 3, the two or three Ys are the same or different and 
each is one of the groups mentioned above, that when n is 
2 or more, two Ys may form a methylenedioxy group, that 
when X is a nitrogen atom, n is 0 and that when A is -NH-, 
m is 1 to 5]. The compounds of the present invention 
represented by the formula (1) has an excellent 
lipoxygenase inhibiting activity and cyclooxygenase 
inhibiting activity. Examples of lipoxygenases are 5-lipoxygenase, 
12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase, etc. 
The compounds of the invention exhibit, in particular, a 
potent activity of 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. The compounds of the
