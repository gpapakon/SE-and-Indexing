<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel tetrazolinones, to a
process for the preparation thereof, and to their use as
paddy-herbicides.It has already been disclosed that tetrazolinone derivatives
have herbicidal properties (see U.S. Patents Nos. 4,956,469;
5,003,075 and 5,019,152 or the corresponding European Applications
EP-A-146 279 and EP-A-202 929).The results of a quantitative structure-activity relationships
(QSAR) study in this series of herbicidal 1-phenyl-4-carbamoyl-5(4)-tetrazolinone
derivatives have also be reported
(see Proc. Br. Crop Prot. Conf.-Weeds (1987), pp.
249-255); this study includes the three closely related
compounds designated as comparative compounds C-1, C-2 and
C-3 in the "Examples" section of the present specification
(see below).Further, there have been described certain 1-phenyl-4-carbamoyl-5(4)-tetrazolinones
as herbicides which essentially
differ from those of the present invention in that they
cannot bear a cycloalkyl substituent on the carbamoyl
moiety (see the Art.54(3)EPC-documents EP-A-571 854, EP-A-571 855,
EP-A- 572 855 and EP-A-578 090). There have now been found novel tetrazolinones of the
formula (I)

   wherein
X represents chloro,Y represents hydrogen atom, chloro, or methyl,R1 represents ethyl or n-propyl, andR2 represents cyclopentyl or cylohexyl, with the proviso that
the total of the carbon atoms of R1 and R2 is 7 or 8.The compounds of the formula (I) can be obtained by a
process in which
a) compounds of the formula (II)

   wherein X and Y have the same meanings as mentioned
before,
are reacted with compounds of the formula (III)

   wherein R1 and R2 have the same meanings as mentioned
above, and hal is an eliminating group such as
chlorine or bromine,
in the presence of inert solvents, and if appropriate, in
the presence of an acid binder.The novel tetrazolinones (I) exhibit powerful herbicidal
properties, in particular against paddy-field weeds.While the compounds of the formula (I), according to the
invention, generically fall within the scope of the aforementioned
U.S. and corresponding EP patent rights, the compounds
of the formula (I) have not been specifically disclosed in these
references. And, surprisingly, the compounds of the formula (I) exhibit
a substantially much greater herbicidal action against
paddy-weeds than those specifically known from the
references.Among the compounds of the formula (I), according to the
invention, preferred compounds are those in which
X represents chloro,Y represents hydrogen atom, or methyl,R1 represents ethyl
