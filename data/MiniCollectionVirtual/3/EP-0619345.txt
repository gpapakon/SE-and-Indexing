group substituted by 0 to 5 halogen atoms and having 1 to 

20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group substituted by 0 to 5 
halogen atoms and having 2 to 20 carbon atoms or an alkynyl 

group substituted by 0 to 5 halogen atoms and having 2 to 
20 carbon atoms, and at least one of R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ is 

substituted by the halogen atom; X is a halogen atom; each 
of k, ℓ, m and n is independently a value of from 0 to 3; 

each of o, p, q and r is independently a value of 0, 1 or 
2, and all of them are not 0 simultaneously; each sum of k 

and o, ℓ and p, m and q, and n and r is independently in 
the range of from 0 to 4; Met is two hydrogen atoms, a  

 
divalent metal atom, a trivalent mono-substituted metal 

atom, a tetravalent di-substituted metal atom or an oxy-metal 
atom; an optical recording medium formed by adding 

this phthalocyanine to a recording layer; and a near infra-red 
absorbing agent comprising the phthalocyanine. The 

above-mentioned phthalocyanine can be used to provide the 
optical recording medium having excellent characteristics 

of reflectance, sensitivity, recording properties, stability 
to reproduction light, shelf stability and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound useful
as a novel recording material for optical discs and a near
infrared-absorbing agent which can play an important role
in optoelectronics fields of information recording, display
sensors, protective spectacles and the like; an optical
recording medium such as an optical disc or an optical card
in which the compound is contained in a recording layer;
and a near infrared-absorbing agent comprising the compound.Techniques for utilizing phthalocyanine dyestuffs
in recording layers of recording media such as optical
discs and optical cards are widely known by Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open Nos. 154888/1986 (EP 18646),
197280/1986, 246091/1986, 39286/1987 (USP 4,769,307),
37991/1988 and 39388/1988, but the phthalocyanines disclosed
in these publications have been insufficient as the 
recording media from the viewpoints of sensitivity, refractive index, recording
properties and the like. A compound in which they have been improved is described in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 62878/1991, but this compound is still poor
in recording properties at the time of writing by a laser beam, and so it is not sufficiently
practical yet. Furthermore, it is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos.
214388/1992 and 238150/1993 that a phthalocyanine in which fluorine is introduced
into a substituent is excellent in solubility and adhesive properties to a resin, but the
introduction of the fluorine group does not contribute to the improvement of the
sensitivity at the time of the writing by the laser beam.EP-A-0519423, discloses a specific phthalocyanine compound having substituents
containing hetero atoms, particularly nitrogen atoms at α-positions. This document
further discloses an optical recording medium obtained by using the phthalocyanine
compound and which has high reflectance and high sensitivity.EP-A-0513370, discloses a phthalocyanine compound substituted by halogen atoms
which are directly bonding to phthalocyanine nucleus. However, there is no description
or suggestion of alkoxy group having halogen atoms as the substituents.EP-A-0462368, relates to an optical recording card and discloses a phthalocyanine
compound substituted by halogen atoms which are directly bonding to phthalocyanine
nucleus like as EP-A-0513370. However, there is no description or suggestion of
alkoxy group having halogen atoms as the substituents.The above-mentioned phthalocyanines do not have sufficient performances regarding
sensitivity (a C/N ratio or an optimum
