<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for producing trim covers for vehicle 
seats including a forming tool (11) of a standardized 

design which is adapted to receive different style line 
inserts (18) to produce different vehicle seat trim 

covers having different style lines, the forming tool 
having a contoured forming surface (14) which forms the 

basic shape for the trim cover, and each of the style 
line inserts having a style line surface (22) which forms 

an individually styled portion of a trim cover. In 
shaping the trim cover material, the material is pressed 

between the forming tool (11) and a pressing tool which 
has a forming surface that is complementary to the 

contoured forming surface of the forming tool (11) and 
generic to all of the style lines provided by the 

different style line inserts which are useable with the 
forming tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle seat assemblies, and more particularly, to 
a forming tool including a removable style line insert for use in producing vehicle 
seat trim covers. Typically, in the production of vehicle seat trim covers, forming tools are 
constructed and used which have a surface contour which is complementary to 
the final desired shape of the vehicle seat or back. One example of such 
forming tools is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,860,415, entitled "Vehicle Seat 
Assembly With Pour In Place Foam Body," which was issued August 29, 1989. 
In the process disclosed in this patent, material for a vehicle seat cover is placed 
inside out on a forming tool which has the desired complementary contours to 
the finished product. The material is shaped to the contours of the forming tool 
by vacuum forming. Another known method for producing vehicle seat 
assemblies uses complementary shaped forming tools. The seat cover material 
is shaped by pressing the material between the complementary shaped forming 
tools under conditions of heat and pressure. In both methods, the forming tools 
must be individually made with the desired surface contours. Consequently, any 
small change in the styling detail requires a completely new forming tool or set 
of forming tools that incorporates the final shape for the vehicle seat being 
produced. Moreover, changing a forming tool or forming tool set is a relatively 
difficult procedure because the forming tools are large and bulky and are 
relatively heavy. Also, when the cover fabric is shaped by pressing it between 
complementary forming tools, the forming tools are heated to a temperature of  
 
about 230Â° Fahrenheit. Consequently, special procedures are required for 
handling the forming tools during a changeover. In addition, when 
complementary forming tools are used, a tooling changeover requires that both 
of the forming tools be replaced and so the forming tools must be realigned with 
one another during the retooling operation. Forming tools having removable inserts which permit modification of the 
insert instead of replacement of the entire forming tool are described in U.S. 
patent No. 4,975,135 issued on December 4, 1990. The forming tools described 
in this patent allow interchange of styles for producing vehicle seat covers 
having differing contours as consumer demand dictates. However, the insert is 
used in shaping substantially the entire "A" surface of the vehicle seat, that is 
about 80% of the "A" surface. Because the insert in itself
