<ABSTRACT>
The auxiliary screw (205) is actuated by means of a motor 
(47) with electronic control, equipped with speed and phase 

transducers (147) connected to a logic unit (50-51-52-53) 
which by means of suitable transducers (146) notes the speed 

and the phase of any point of the kinematic chain which 
transmits the movement to the working carousel and to the 

main screw (105). In order cyclically to create a space in 
the main screw, the logic unit makes provision to slow down 

and then reaccelerate the motor of the auxiliary screw in 
such a manner that this screw is dephased by a complete 

revolution every two revolutions of the main screw and then 
resumes, at the end of the two revolutions, the speed and 

the phase of the main screw. Also described is the use of 
such a double-screw device (500), with synchro-tie, for 

controlling the flow of bottles leaving a working carousel, 
to bring about the rejection of any bottles which are not 

correctly filled or with other defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
To control the flow of small bottles, bottles or 
other containers which have to be fed in phase to a 
working carousel, it is known to use at least one screw 
which is positioned tangentially to the carousel, 
actuated in phase with the carousel itself and 
interchangeable according to the ranges of the shapes of 
the bottles. The screw is positioned laterally to the 
flow of bottles, is screwed onto the same and with its 
own helix causes the same bottles to proceed with the 
speed and with the pitch necessary for feeding in phase 
to the working carousel. When it is necessary to stop the 
flow of bottles fed to the carousel, on the occurrence of 
certain operative conditions as a result of which the 
carousel itself has to remain in operation, it is known 
to use a feed device consisting of a screw divided into 
two pieces which are positioned one immediately following 
the other and normally rotate in the same direction and  
 
at the same speed and in which the thread of the helix of 
the first piece of screw is aligned with that of the 
second piece of screw so that the bottles pass with 
continuity from one screw to the other screw and arrive 
at the working carousel. In the following account, the 
screw which interacts directly with the working carousel 
will be termed the main screw while the other, which is 
outside the plan dimensions of the carousel, will be 
termed the auxiliary screw. When it is necessary to stop 
the flow of bottles, the auxiliary screw is stopped while 
the main screw continues to rotate in phase with the 
carousel. When the feed of bottles has to be restarted, 
the auxiliary screw is reactuated only when the thread of 
its helix is aligned with that of the main screw. This 
solution means that when the flow of bottles stops, the 
auxiliary screw remains full of bottles so that the 
subsequent starting of the same presents no problems. A 
device of this type is described in the Jagemberg Italian 
Patent no. 1,153,149, in which the same device is indicated 
for coupling to labelling machines. Devices of this 
type have recently also been used in bottle-filling 
machines for cyclically creating in the main screw spaces 
which are necessary for leaving empty a corresponding 
station in a carousel intended for transferring the 
bottles to a filling carousel so as to be capable of 
cyclically extracting from and then reinserting into the 
same transfer carousel a bottle, the tare of which is 
noted. This procedure is repeated with such a flow that 
the empty bottles, weighed,

<CLAIMS>
Device for feeding and for discharging bottles 
into and from working carousels, of the type which 

comprises at least two screws which are positioned one 
immediately following the other and one of which 

constitutes the normal continuation of the other, the 
threads of the helices of the two screws normally being 

aligned with one another and the two screws normally 
being actuated in the same direction and at the same 

speed, and of the type in which, on the occurrence of 
certain operative conditions, the screw which interacts 

with the carousel, called the main screw in the 
following, continues to rotate at the normal speed while 

the other screw, called the auxiliary screw in the 
following, is actually stopped to interrupt the flow of 

bottles controlled by it, and is then reactuated in 
synchronism and in phase with the same main screw when 

the flow of bottles is to proceed normally, the device of 
such a type being characterized in that the main screw 

(105-1500) is connected to the kinematic chain of the 
carousel while the auxiliary screw (205-2500) is actuated 

by an electric motor (47), the speed and the phase of 
which can be controlled electronically by means of 

suitable transducers (147) which are connected to 
programmable electronic circuits (50-51-52-53) and also 

note the speed of rotation and the phase of the main 
screw by means of suitable transducers (146) associated 

with the motor (46) which actuates said screw and the 
carousel served by it, the whole being designed so that, 

 
when necessary, the motor of the auxiliary screw is first 

decelerated, possibly passing through zero velocity or 
without stopping, after which the same motor is 

accelerated to cause the auxiliary screw to rotate at the 
same speed and in phase with the main screw, the whole so 

as to avoid sudden relative movements between the bottles 
and the auxiliary screw, with the disadvantages which 

derive from this state. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the auxiliary screw (205-2500) is actuated by a 

brushless motor (47) of one of equivalent type-and the 
kinematic chain which actuates the working carousel and 

the main screw (105-1500) it controls, is actuated by any 
suitable electric motor (46) equipped with speed and 

phase transducers. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, when it is used in feeding bottles to a group of 

carousels intended for filling, for checking the tare and 
gross weight and for corking the same bottles, for which 

it is necessary to create cyclically a space in the 
thread of the main screw (105), the electronic means (50-51-52-53) 

which control the functioning of the motor (47) 
of the auxiliary screw (205) are such that said screw 

slows down and subsequently reaccelerates, without 
passing through zero velocity and in such a manner that 

the same auxiliary screw is dephased by one complete 
revolution every two revolutions of the main screw and 

resumes, at the end of these two revolutions, the speed 
and the phase of the same main screw. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, when it is used for controlling the flow of bottles 

leaving a working carousel (54), for example the corking 
carousel, means are provided so that, when a defective 

bottle has to be removed from said flow, the auxiliary 
screw (2500) is decelerated and possibly stopped when the 

defective bottle arrives in the region thereof, which 
bottle is first shifted towards the outside by the thread 

of the helix of the main screw (1500) and then by the 
thrust of the next bottle which forces the same defective 

bottle to leave the guide channel (62) laterally and to 
enter a removal channel (58) where the same bottle is 

then retained by suitable means (60-61) to function as a 
side for controlling the successive flow of bottles when 

the auxiliary screw (2500) starts rotating again in 
synchronism and in phase with the main screw, the whole 

being designed in order to be able to divert possible 
defective bottles onto a transport line (59) alongside 

that (55) for discharging the correctly filled and closed 
bottles. 
Device according to the preceding claims, in 
which the main screw (105, 1500) and the auxiliary screw 

(205-2500) are supported by coaxial shafts (18-23), the 
hollow external one of which is supported rotatably by an 

arm (16) mounted with the possibility of oscillating on 
a tube (12) parallel to said screws and in turn supported 

in a cantilevered manner by a hollow vertical column 
(10), in which there are accommodated the positive 

movement transmissions (44-45) positioned end to end with 
 

a pair of shafts (14-42) which are arranged coaxially and 
are rotatable in said tube and project with the other end 

into an opening of said arm (16), where, by means of 
other positive movement transmissions (40-41), they 

transmit the rotation to said coaxial shafts of the 
screws, elastic means (35) being provided for stressing 

the arm with the screws in the direction of the guide 
channel (3-62) in which the bottles flow, which is 

defined at the bottom by a guide (33) fixed in a 
cantilevered manner to said hollow column (10), and there 

resting against an end part of said guide the end of a 
push rod (36) screwed into said arm, by acting on which 

it is possible to vary the distance between the screws 
and said guide channel in order to adapt it to different 

sizes of bottle. 
Device according to the preceding claims, in 
which the push rod (36) mounted on the arm (16) which 

bears the screws and which rests against a fixed reaction 
point (133), in order to maintain the same screws at the 

desired distance from the flow channel of the bottles, 
interacts directly or indirectly with a sensor (39) which 

notes and signals any shifts of the screws from said 
channel in the presence of jams or problems in the 

advance of the bottles which may possibly have to require 
stopping of the working carousels. 
Device according to the preceding claims, in 
which the screws (105-1500 and 205-2500) are equipped 

with respective longitudinal and internal splines which 
interact with wedging keys (19-26) borne by the relative 

 
actuating shafts (18-25-23), the main screw (105-1500) 

being retained axially on the relative hollow shaft (18) 
by a ring nut (21) screwed onto the free end section (20) 

of the core of said screw, while the auxiliary screw 
(205-2500) is retained axially on the relative shaft (23-25) 

by one or more projections (30) projecting radially 
from said shaft and interacting with an internal annular 

recess (31) of the core of the screw and pushed outwards 
by the inclined head (128) of a push button (28) which 

projects axially from said shaft and which is stressed 
towards the outside by a spring (29), so that, by 

pressing said push button, said projections (30) are 
neutralized and it is possible to slip off the auxiliary 

screw, all in order to simplify the replacement of the 
screws to adapt to the range of sizes of the bottles 

being processed.
