<DESCRIPTION>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ESERETHOLEThe present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compound of formula (II)which is an useful intermediate for the preparation of eserethole.The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of eserethole starting from compound (II).Eserethole of formula (VII)
 is in its turn the main intermediate for the synthesis of ( - ) eserine and the analogues thereof , used in human therapy for the treatment of various diseases , some of which are particularly severe and wide-spread, such as Alzheimer ' s disease.( - )Eserine is a natural alkaloid which can be prepared either by extraction or synthetically.Some of the described total synthe sis involve the 

 intermediate formation of (-)eserethole or (±)eserethole.The interest for an industrial process to prepare eserethole and the precursors thereof which is advanta¬ geous as far as yield, purity and costs are concerned is therefore evident.The known preparation of the intermediate of for¬ mula (II) (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 5_7, 563, 1935) comprises five steps, according to the following scheme I:Scheme INow a process has been found , and it is the first object of the invention, which allows to prepare compound (II) in only two steps, according to the following scheme (II): 

 Scheme II
 acids 1 CH.(II)4-(N-Methylamino)phenol is reacted with a 2- halogen-propionyl chloride to give the novel interme- diates of formula (la) (X = Cl) or (lb) (X = Br), from which compound (II) can be obtained by cyclization in the presence of Lewis acids.The reaction conditions and the solvents are those conventional for this kind of reactions. In the first step, toluene as the solvent and a reaction temperature of about 20 °C are particularly preferred.In the second step, aluminium chloride is particu¬ larly preferred as the Lewis acid, whereas suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly chlo- robenzene.The preparation of eserethole from compound (II) was described by a number of Authors.Common to all the known synthesis are the 0- alkylation of the intermediate (II) with alkyl sulfates ' and the subsequent alkylation at the 3 position of the oxindole ring with chloroacetonitrile, which alkylation 

can be carried out with sodium ethoxide in ethanol (Julian et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 5_7, 563, 1935) or in liquid-liquid duoble phase in the presence of chiral phase transfer catalysts (PTC) (Wong et al. J. Org. Chem. 5_6, (2), 873 (1991).From the resulting compound, two reaction pathways can be followed: i)
