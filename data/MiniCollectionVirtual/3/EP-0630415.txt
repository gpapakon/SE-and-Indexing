<ABSTRACT>
Degreasing agents for the treatment of skins, hides, leathers and the like, based on non-ionic emulsifiers of the fatty alcohol alkoxylate type containing a mixture of (a) C12-18 fatty alcohol ethoxylates with an average of over 6 EO groups in the molecule and (b) first-runnings fatty alcohol ethoxylates with over 3 EO groups in the molecule, in which (i) the fatty alcohols on which components (a and b) are based have an iodine number of under 10 and (ii) component (b) is in a quantity of 2 to 10 % wt. in relation to the sum of (a and b), are distinguished by their effectiveness and are biological acceptable.

<CLAIMS>
The use of mixtures of nonionic emulsifiers of the 
fatty alcohol ethoxylate type for degreasing skins, 

pelts, hides, leathers characterized in 
that they contain 


(a) C
12-18
 fatty alcohol ethoxylates containing on average 
more than 6 EO groups in the molecule and 
(b) head-fractionated fatty alcohol ethoxylates containing 
no more than 3 EO groups in the molecule, 
 
with the proviso that 


i) the fatty alcohols on which components (a) and (b) 
are based have an iodine value below 20 and 
ii) component (b) is present in a quantity of around 2 
to 25% by weight, based on the sum of (a) and (b). 
The use claimed in claim 1, in which component (a) 
contains mixtures of fatty alcohol ethoxylates differing 

in their average EO degrees, the range up to 15 EO and, 
more particularly, up to 10 EO per mole of fatty alcohol 

preferably not being exceeded. 
The use claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which component 
(b) is a head-fractionated C
8
 fatty alcohol ethoxylate 
with an average EO degree of 1.5 to 2.5. 
The use claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, in which 
component (a) is a mixture of 


(a1): saturated C
12-18
 fatty alcohol ethoxylates with an 
average EO degree of 6 to 8 and 
(a2): those with an average EO degree of around 9 to 12, 
 
the mixing ratio between components (a1) and (a2) preferably 

being 2:1.  
 
The use claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that components (a) and (b) are dissolved in 

biodegradable solvents based on high-boiling carboxylic 
acid esters, ethers, alcohols and/or carbonic acid esters 

liquid at room temperature. 
The use claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
components (a) and (b) are present in the biodegradable 

solvents in quantities of 5 to 90% by weight and preferably 
in quantities of around 10 to 60% by weight, based 

on the product as a whole. 
The use claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that Guerbet alcohols and/or higher olefinically unsaturated 

fatty alcohols are present as the solvents. 
Degreasing preparations based on nonionic emulsifiers 
of the fatty alcohol alkoxylate type for the 

treatment of skins, pelts, hides, leathers, 
characterized in that they contain a mixture of 


(a) C
12-18
 fatty alcohol ethoxylates containing on average 
more than 6 EO groups in the molecule and 
(b) head-fractionated fatty alcohol ethoxylates containing 
no more than 3 EO groups in the molecule, 
 
with the proviso that 


i) the fatty alcohols on which components (a) and (b) 
are based have an iodine value below 20 and 
ii) component (b) is present in a quantity of around 2 
to 25% by weight, based on the sum of (a) and (b) 
 
and with the further proviso that 


iii) component (b) is a head-fractionated C
8
 fatty alcohol 
ethoxylate with an average EO degree of 1.5 to 2.5 

and/or  
 
iv) component (a) is a mixture of 

(a1): saturated C
12-18
 fatty alcohol ethoxylates with 
an average EO degree of 6 to 8 and 
(a2): those with an average EO degree of around 9 
to 12, the mixing ratio between components 

(a1) and (a2) preferably being 2:1, and/or 
v) components (a) and (b) being present in the form of 
a solution in biodegradable solvents based on high-boiling 

carboxylic acid esters, ethers, alcohols 
and/or carbonic acid esters liquid at room temperature, 


components (a) and (b) being present in a quantity 
of 5 to 90% by weight and preferably in quantity 

of around 10 to 60% by weight, based on the 
product as a whole, in the biodegradable solvents 

and/or 
Guerbet alcohols and/or higher olefinically 
unsaturated fatty alcohols being present as the 

solvents.
