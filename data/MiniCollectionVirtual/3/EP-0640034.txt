<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus are disclosed for the production of high precision large scale, micro and mini structures (24) using three-dimensional stereolithography. The objects (24) formed using these methods have minimal stress between layers and low curl distortion. The objects also have low warpage because no post-cure treatment is necessary. The methods include the use of elevated pressure, elevated temperature, or sequential polymerization of polymer precursor fluid (10), or a combination of these, in the three-dimensional stereolithographic process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RAPID PROTOTYPE THREE-DIMENSIONAL ÎžTEREOLITHOGRAPHYThis invention is in the area of rapid prototype, high precision three dimensional stereolithography.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThree dimensional stereolithography is a very recently developed prototyping technology for the rapid production of models for form-fit-and-function testing. The process is a revolutionary approach to the preparation of a wide variety of objects without tooling, with the assistance of computer assisted design (CAD) and computer assisted manufacture (CAM) .As disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,575,330 and 4,929,402 to Hull, a CAD file of the desired object is prepared and converted mathematically into stacked cross-sections, or layers. The first layer of the object is scanned with a polymerization initiating source, typically an ultraviolet laser, on the surface of a vat of ethylenically unsaturated monomer, or mixture of monomers. The first layer of the model, that is positioned on an elevator platform in the vat, is then lowered a programmed amount with an actuator mechanism, so that a new coating of polymerizable liquid covers the solidified layer. A wiper blade perfects the coating depth, and then the laser draws a new layer on top of the preceding one. This procedure is repeated until the desired three dimensional structure is completed. Webbings can be added to the design as necessary to keep object protrusions from floating away. The prepared object (green body) is a partially cured structure. After removal from the vat, the green body is cured, and sanded, or otherwise smoothed, as necessary.The '330 patent (see FIG. 4 of that patent) teaches, as an alternative embodiment, floating the ultraviolet-curable liquid on a heavier, immiscible, ultraviolet transparent liquid layer in the vat. In this embodiment, the UV source 

radiates from below the vat through the ultraviolet transparent material, and is focused at the interface of the two liquids. The object is pulled up out of the ultraviolet- curable liquid, rather than down and further into the liquid, as shown in FIG 3. of '330. This embodiment is useful to minimize the amount of curable material used. However, the incompletely polymerized gree body may experience sagging and distortion.U.S. Patent No. 5,011,635 to Murphy, et al., provides an apparatus for 3D-stereolithography that includes a fluid phase, a substantially impermeable, movable membrane positioned on top of the fluid phase, a radiatio - polymerizable liquid organic phase positioned on top of the membrane and
