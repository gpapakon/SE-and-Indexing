<ABSTRACT>
A thin film electrocoagulation liquid treatment 
apparatus includes a nonconductive housing formed by 

opposite top and bottom walls, opposite side walls, and 
tubular end members with slots therethrough which define a 

treatment chamber. Pluralities of elongated electrodes 
extend between the side walls and are spaced along the top 

and bottom walls in spaced apart interleaved relation to 
define a serpentine fluid treatment path. The tubular end 

members form fluid connections, one end member receiving 
liquid to be treated from a supply conduit and the other 

discharging the treated liquid to a discharge conduit. A 
DC power supply has opposite poles thereof connected 

respectively to the sets of electrodes in such a manner 
that the polarity on succeeding electrodes is opposite. 

The first two electrodes in the flow direction of the fluid 
path are preferably connected to the negative pole of the 

power supply. A treatment process employing the treater 
apparatus includes pressure differential monitoring across 

the treater and flow direction reversal to avoid clogging 
the treater and temperature differential monitoring across 

the treater to optimize the consumption of electrical power 
by the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
In attempting to control environmental pollution from 
industries, human waste, and naturally decomposing minerals 
and chemicals, a wide variety of chemical and mechanical 
processes have been developed. Chemical methods have attempted to cause a 
predetermined reaction between chemical additives and 
impurities contained within an aqueous solution. The most 
common reactions are designed to cause coalescences of the 
impurities and the chemical additives. As the coalescing 
occurs the materials flocculate and the particles which are 
then formed layer to their specific gravity within the 
aqueous solution. Many times, to effectively remove the 
chemically flocculated contaminants, additional chemicals 
are added to increase the size of the particles and thus 
the specific gravity of the particle. Increasing the size 
of the floc with additional chemical additives causes more 
rapid settling and better defined segregated layering 
within the solution. Air can be added to some solutions to 
cause a more rapid rise of the flocculated particles when 
the formed particles have a lighter specific gravity than 
the base solution. Combinations of chemicals and air can 
be used for complex aqueous solutions that have more than 
one contaminant.  Mechanical methods are designed to achieve similar 
results as chemical additives, but to a lesser degree of 
purity in the final aqueous solution. Filters, 
centrifuges, plate separators, and clarifiers are the most 
common mechanical methods employed to remove contaminants 
from aqueous solutions. In most cases the impurities that 
are removed mechanically are suspended solids or dissolved 
particles that are flocculated by changes in process 
temperature or retention time in the processed solution. Over two decades ago, the chemical and mechanical 
methods of treating the aqueous solutions were thought to 
be adequate treatment prior to disposal. Disposal of the 
treated aqueous solution into the oceans, streams, lakes, 
and underground wells were common. Tests have shown that 
small amounts of impurities that escaped treatment from 
chemical or mechanical process or a combination of both 
processes have accumulated in soils, ground waters, lakes, 
and river beds. Many rivers and streams are now considered 
to be waste sites. Lakes have been drained and their lake 
beds have been hauled away to be treated as hazardous 
waste. Many times the chemical residue left from an 
original reaction which was used to remove a waste from 
industrial aqueous solutions became the
