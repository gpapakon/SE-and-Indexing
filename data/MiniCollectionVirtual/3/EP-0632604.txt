<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a baseband signal combiner and to a 
sampler typically used in radio relay systems but also in generic 

communication systems. 
In order to avoid temporary failures in the free space links, 
space and/or frequency diversity techniques are used, which 

consist in the use of two suitable spaced receive antennas or of 
two transmission frequencies. By suitably combining the signals 

thus received, the failures in radio links can be redued. 
The invention provides the use of a particular algorithm of the 
type CMA (Constant Modulus Algorithm) which, being independent of 

the combined signal phase, does not interact with the carrier 
recovery circuits. 
Moreover, by applying the same algorithm also to the sampler, the 
cooperation of the two circuits to the optimization of the output 

signal is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a baseband signal combiner and to a
sampler to be used typically in radio relay systems but also in
generic communication systems. One of the drawbacks often
occurring in free-space links is the multipath phenomenon. In
these circumstances the signal available across the receiving
antenna is a combination of various delayed and/or attenuated
signals. This combination of signals, in some instances, could
lead to the impossibility of maintaining the link. A common
remedy to this drawback is to resort to space and/or frequency
diversity techniques that consist in the use of two suitably
spaced antennas in reception or of two transmission frequencies.
By combining suitably the two received signals the above-mentioned
drawbacks can be compensated for. One of the first
works on baseband combiners is known from the article "Decision
Directed Diversity Combiners Principles and Simulation Results"
by J.A. Henriksson published in IEEE Journal On Selected Areas in
Communications, Vol. SAC-5, No. 3, April 1987, which suggests to
minimize the mean square error (MMSE) at the output of the
combiner in order to combine at best the two received signals,
and it introduces also the use of the so-called "Minimum
Projection Strategy" which consists in minimizing the mean square
deflection between the received signal and the desired reference
direction. In the article "MMSE baseband combiner for microwave digital
radio" by A.N. D'Avolio, M. Mariano, U. Mengali, A. Spalvieri,
published in Conference Record, 2nd European Conference on Radio
Relay System pages 235-242, April 1989, there is disclosed a
combiner using the MMSE technique and provides a solution to the
timing of the sampler by using a special algorithm. In both works
some aspects are not investigated thoroughly. The first aspect is
relative to the interaction between the combiner/sampler and the
carrier recovery circuit present in the demodulator. A second
aspect is relative to the actual cooperation of the combiner and
of the sampler with particular regard to the capacity of converging
to the optimal condition of operation.PROCEEDINGS OF 1986 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS
