<ABSTRACT>
A filter (10, 10A) for use in a high temperature, 
high pressure application in a pyrotechnic air bag inflator 

comprising a rigid porous body (10) having a reticulated 
structure formed of strong, porous, metal, metal alloy or 

ceramic material having a high thermal diffusivity and 
surface area for absorbing heat from the gas and defining a 

plurality of tortuous passages for entrapping contaminants 
from the gas passing through the filter. The porous body 

may be formed by vitreous bonding or sintering of ceramic 
material or by soaking open-celled foam material in a 

ceramic mixture and sintering. The filter (10A) may 
include an outer element (13) of lower porosity or 

permeability than an inner element (11) the two elements 
being separated by a permeable ceramic paper liner (14). 

The filter is suitable for inflators employing non-azide 
gas generating material (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 08/114,211, 
filed August 30, 1993, and assigned to the same 
assignee. The present invention relates to a new and 
improved unitary, rigid, drop-in type filter for use in 
a high temperature, high pressure application in a 
pyrotechnic air bag inflator. More particularly, the 
filter is particularly designed to withstand the high 
temperature and high pressures encountered from contact 
with gas generated in a pyrotechnic air bag inflator 
from gas generating material such as sodium azide 
wafers. The filter functions to cool the hot gases 
before they reach the air bag and serves to eliminate 
and trap particulates and residues generated during 
ignition so that they do not enter the air bag and contaminate 
the vehicle. In prior pyrotechnic air bag inflators, metal 
wire mesh or screen has been used to filter the gaseous 
flow emanating from the combustion of the pyrotechnic 
materials of an air bag inflator, before the gases enter 
the air bag. Japanese unexamined Patent Publication No. 
50-48797 discloses an air permeable trap or filter of  
 
granules or particles used to screen or filter gaseous 
flow from an air bag inflator before the gas enters the 
air bag. A major concern in pyrotechnic type air bag 
inflators is that the expanding gas generated for inflation 
of an air bag is so high in temperature that burning 
of the air bag or injury to an occupant occurs when 
the air bag is inflated. Sometimes, pyrotechnic material 
is ignited to generate high temperature gas which 
contains impurities such as molten or gaseous metals and 
oxides which are toxic and cause damage to the human 
body. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a new and improved pyrotechnic air 
bag inflator and more particularly a new and improved 
filter for a pyrotechnic air bag inflator. It is another object of the present invention 
to provide a new and improved air bag inflator capable 
of utilizing non-azide type gas generating material such 
as mixtures of copper oxide and amino tetrazol. Yet another object of the present invention is 
to provide a new and improved filter for a non-azide gas 
generating material which has a greater resistance to 
corrosion and chemical reaction with the generated gas 
and material used for gas generation. It is another object of the invention to provide 
a new and improved filter for a pyrotechnic air bag 
inflator which is capable of absorbing substantial quantities 
of
