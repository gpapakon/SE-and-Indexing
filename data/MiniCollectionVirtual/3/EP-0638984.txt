<ABSTRACT>
A low voltage charge pump operable with a low voltage power supply 
and a clock signal is provided for delivering a final output voltage which is 

higher than the supply voltage. The low voltage charge pump comprises MOS 
capacitors formed of MOS devices, each capacitor including a p-well acting as 

a plate of the respective capacitor. Through this arrangement, the effective 
area of the capacitor is increased resulting in an increase in capacitance. 

Therefore, a more efficient charge pumping effect is provided in a low voltage 
power supply such as 3.3 volts. The p-well of each of the capacitor is driven 

from ground voltage to one threshold voltage less than the supply voltage to 
minimize forward bias of the p-wells and the n-type substrates of the MOS 

devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to charge pumps, and in particular, to charge 
pumps in low voltage integrated circuit technology. Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are well known. Field effect 
transistors (FET) MOS devices are also well known and are generally referred 
to as MOSFETs. For example, a n-channel MOSFET consists of a lightly doped 
p-well formed on a n-type substrate. Two highly doped n⁺ regions are diffused. 
One of the n⁺ regions is connected to a conductor and is referred to as a 
source (S). The other of the n⁺ regions is connected to another conductor and 
is referred to as a drain (D). Between the source and the drain, another 
conductor is positioned which is known as the gate (G). The source and the 
drain are diffused into the silicon and the gate sits atop an insulating layer, 
generally a silicon dioxide layer. In essence, the gate is charged so as to 
induce a n-channel between the two separated n⁺ regions of the MOSFET. 
This will produce an enhancement type MOS device. P-channel MOSFETs can 
similarly be constructed. Charge pumps are circuit elements using the pumping action of diode 
connected MOSFETs and MOS capacitors to provide a voltage source of higher 
voltage than the power supplies. A diode connected MOSFET (known also as 
a MOSFET diode or a MOS transistor diode) is a MOS transistor with its gate 
and drain terminals shorted to each other. By applying an oscillating voltage 
to the tied source and drain terminals of the MOS capacitor, a successively  
 
higher voltage is induced at the source terminal of the MOS transistor diode 
with time, until a steady state voltage is reached. The charge pumping effect may be achieved by a MOS capacitor, which 
is a MOSFET with its source and drain terminals shorted to each other, and 
with its gate terminal connected to a MOS transistor diode and its p-wells 
connected to ground voltage. In this case, the gate conductor forms one plate 
of the capacitor. As it is well known, MOS devices have three basic states of 
operation: inversion, depletion and accumulation. In case of a n-channel MOS 
device, inversion occurs when the voltage VGS between G and S is greater than 
a certain threshold voltage, VT which is characterized by the design and 
fabrication process of the device. When inversion occurs, a n-channel 
connecting the source and drain region is induced at the top of the p-well 
underneath the gate. The effective capacitance of the MOS capacitor is that of 
the source-drain to gate capacitance in parallel with the n-channel
