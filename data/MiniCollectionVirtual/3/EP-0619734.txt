<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole
for use in therapy and
pharmaceutical formulations comprising said compound. The
invention also relates to the use of said compound for
the manufacture of a medicament. In a further aspect the
invention relates to a method for prevention or treatment
of neurodegeneration or for obtaining sedation or
anticonvulsant effect by administering such a compound in
a sufficient amount. Another aspect of the invention is a
pharmaceutical formulation for use in the prevention or
treatment of neurodegeneration or for obtaining sedation
or anticonvulsant effect comprising said compound as
active ingredient.There are various publications on the metabolism of
chlormethiazole. The metabolites of special interest in
connection with the present invention are 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole
having the formula

and optical isomers, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
or solvate thereof. Said compound is reported in the
literature as a metabolite identified primarily by mass
spectrometry. For the sake of simplicity said compounds
are hereinafter referred to as 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole. In Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 29 (II), Nr 11 (1979), pp.
1655-1658, it is reported by Ende. M., Spiteller, G.,
Remberg G., and Heipertz, R. that one of the metabolites
of chlormethiazole in human urine seems to be 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole
(substance 9 on page
1658).5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole is used by -
Pal, R. and Spiteller, G. in Xenobiotica, 1982, vol. 12,
No. 12, pp. 813-820, for comparision of chlormethiazole
metabolites using mass spectrometry.Offen, C.P., Frearson, M.J., Wilson, K. and Burnett, D.
disclose in Xenobiotica, 1985, vol. 15, No. 6, pp. 503-511
six major metabolite peaks of chlormethiazole in urine.
Peak 4 was identified as 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole.The published data in the above-mentioned documents refers
mainly to structural identification rather than the
pharmacological properties of the metabolites. Thus, the
prior art does not disclose any pharmacological properties
of 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole.The present invention refers to a certain chlormethiazole
metabolite namely 5-(2-chloro-1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole,
optical isomers or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt or a solvate thereof. Within the scope of the
present invention are the two optical isomers (+ and -) as
well as the racemic form (Â±).Different aspects of the present
