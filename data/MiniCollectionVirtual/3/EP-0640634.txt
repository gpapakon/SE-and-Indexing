<ABSTRACT>
A one-component-type composition for a polyurethane 
elastomer, comprising as a main component a polyurethane 

precursor containing a polyisocyanate component, and a 
compound having active hydrogen groups. The polyisocyanate 

component contains a polyisocyanate having at least a 
urethodione group (particularly urethodione and 

isocyanurate groups), and the compound (polyol or the like) 
having active hydrogen groups contains at least two active 

hydrogen groups in its molecule and has a molecular weight 
of 18 to 20000. The polyurethane precursor is obtained by 

reacting the polyisocyanate component and the compound 
having active hydrogen groups under the condition that the 

equivalent ratio of the active hydrogen group in the 
compound having active hydrogen groups to the isocyanate 

group in the polyisocyanate component exceeds 1.0. The 
equivalent ratio of the urethodione group to the active 

hydrogen group in the polyurethane precursor is from 0.25 to 
1.0. The one-component-type composition for a polyurethane 

elastomer has storage stability comparable to that of 
thermoplastic elastomers, can be handled with ease, and 

does not pollute working environment. The composition is 
useful for preparaing elastomers which have physical 

properties equal to those of two-component-type elastomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a one-component-type
composition for a polyurethane elastomer for molding processing and a method for
processing the same by molding.Polyurethane elastomers are excellent in various
properties such as rubber elasticity, chemical resistance,
abrasion resistance, toughness, cold resistance and
durability, They are therefore utilized particularly in 
recent years as paints, floor covering materials, water
proof materials, adhesives, wall covering materials and
sealing materials. Polyurethane elastomers are divided
broadly into thermoplastic elastomers and thermosetting
elastomers.Thermoplastic elastomers (TPU) are linear polyurethanes
having a high molecular weight, and can be processed by
ordinary techniques for processing thermoplastic resins,
such as injection molding or extrusion molding. On the
other hand, thermosetting elastomers are classified into the
following two types:
(1) Two-component type in which polyisocyanate and/or
an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer and a polyol are mixed
with stirring just before the use, and the mixture is then
injected into a mold and cured; and(2) One-component-moisture-curing type in which an
isocyanate-terminated prepolymer is cured by allowing it to
react with moisture in the air.These elastomers have both merits and demerits. The
thermoplastic elastomers are linear polyurethanes having a
high molecular weight, and have semipermanent storage
stability and good working properties. However, their
softening points are low because they do not have a
crosslinked structure. This brings about a drawback in that
they are poor in both heat resistance and compression set.
Furthermore, they usually have a high molecular weight, 
which causes high melt viscosities and low fluidity.
Therefore, they also have a shortcoming in that it is
difficult to mold them into complicated shapes or large-sized
articles. In contrast, the two-component-type
elastomers show high fluidity right after the two components
are mixed, and they can be readily molded into complicated
shapes or large-sized articles. In addition, since they
usually have a crosslinked structure, they are excellent in
heat resistance and compression set. However, the
viscosity of the mixture of the two components is increased
due to a reaction between isocyanate groups and hydroxyl
groups which proceeds in the system, and the mixture is
finally gelled. There is therefore a limitation on the pot
life of the mixture. Moreover, in order to obtain a
reaction product which is
