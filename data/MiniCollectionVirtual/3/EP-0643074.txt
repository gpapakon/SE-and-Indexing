<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to inhibitors against viral 
infection and proliferation composed of peptides shown by 

below mentioned amino acid sequence (1) or (2). 

   The inhibitors against viral infection and proliferation 
of the present invention can suppress the infection and 

proliferation of HIV, influenza virus or cytomegalo virus, 
and are useful for the prevention and treatment of diseases 

caused by these viruses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptide inhibitors against viral 
infection and proliferation. Various efforts have been paid to overcome diseases caused 
by viral infection. However, no effective treatments have 
been found to prevent and to cure diseases caused by 
some viruses such as recent serious world-wide epidemic of 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and annual epidemic of 
influenza. Chemotherapeutic treatment with antiviral agents 
has been used to cope with these diseases caused by viral 
infections. At present, however, antiviral agents which are 
markedly effective against systemic infection are very few. 
Viruses proliferate within living cells and their major 
metabolic function for multiplication depends on living 
cells, that is, viruses use the growth ability of host human 
cells for proliferation after infection. Therefore, most 
chemical substances that suppress the growth of viruses also 
affect the host cells and exhibit toxicity. Antiviral 
agents have some essential problems to be solved due to 
characteristic features of viral infections in addition to 
their low selectivity between viruses and cells.  
 
Particularly, in patients with acute systemic viral 
infectious diseases symptoms are usually developed after the 
virus shows maximum growth in vivo, thus agents which 
prevent infection and/or suppress the proliferation have 
been required. One possible method for preventing the viral 
infection is a vaccination, but it often brings about 
allergic reactions and various side reactions, furthermore 
it is substantially ineffective against viral mutation. The inventors found that iron-binding proteins such as 
lactoferrin (LF), transferrin and ovotransferrin inhibit the 
infection and growth of influenza virus and cytomegalo virus 
(CMV) and accomplished an invention (Japanese Un-examined 
Patent Publication No. 233619 (1990)). LF secreted in milk 
is known as an iron-binding protein which possesses 
antimicrobial activity. Human and bovine LFs have been 
investigated in detail and their total amino acid sequences 
have been determined (M.W Rey et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 
18, 5288 (1990) and P.E. Mead et al., ibid., 18, 7167 
(1990)). Japanese Un-examined Patent Publication No. 233226 
(1989) discloses an antiviral agent containing milk proteins 
such as LF as effective ingredients, explaining that LF is 
effective against viruses with and without envelope. 
Recently, the inventors confirmed the inhibitory effect of 
iron-binding proteins against infection and growth of HIV 
and
