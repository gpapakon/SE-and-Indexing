Computer system
 
   - having several processors (P1, P2, P3) which are 

connected to each other and to each of which a memory 
(S1, S2, S3) is allocated, with the memories (S1, S2, 

S3) having in each case a common memory area (SB),
 
which the processors (P1, P2, P3) access,
 
characterised 


in that in order to synchronise change-overs of 
operating state (BZ0, BZ1, BZ2) of the processors (P1, 

P2, P3) and/or in order to process synchronously 
processor jobs, a data record can be entered into the 

memory area (SB) by the processor which is the first to 
reach a predetermined synchronisation point (MP1, MP2; 

WP1, WP2, WP3) during process-processing, and 
in that a change in the data record can be 
recognised by interrupt arrangements (IC1, IC2, IC3) 

allocated to the processors (P1, P2, P3), whereby 
interrupt signals can be produced by the interrupt 

arrangements (IC1, IC2, IC3) and supplied to the 
processors (P1, P2, P3), as a result of which a changeover 

of operating state of the processors (P1, P2, P3) 
and/or synchronous processing of processor jobs can be 

initiated, with means being provided that indicate to 
the processors whether the synchronisation of a time-critical 

or non-time-critical operating state changeover 
or synchronous processing of processor jobs is to 

be realised. 
Computer system according to claim 1, 
characterised 


in that time-critical change-overs of operating 
state (BZ0, BZ1, BZ2) of the processors (P1, P2, P3) 

and/or the synchronous processing of processor jobs can 
be effected directly after the initiation. 
Computer system according to claim 1, 
characterised  

 

in that non-time-critical operating state 
change-overs (BZ0, BZ1, BZ2) can be effected 

simultaneously after their initiation when all the 
processors (P1, P2, P3) have reached the appropriate 

synchronisation points (WP1, WP2, WP3) during the 
process-processing.
