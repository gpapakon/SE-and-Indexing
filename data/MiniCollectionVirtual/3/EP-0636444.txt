<ABSTRACT>
A gap condition detector (3) detects a discharge 
machining condition of the gap between a 

tool electrode (1) and a work (2). The difference 
between this detection value Vg and a target value 

Vs is multiplied by axial components of a direction 
vector 
a
 in a retreating direction so as to obtain retreat 
speed command V2x to V2z. These values are 

added to speed commands V1x to V1z obtained by 
position loop control to obtain speed commands for 

speed loop control, and servo-motors (6x to 6z) are 
driven to regulate the gap described above. The retreat 

speed commands V2x to V2z are integrated by 
integrators (10x to 10z) to obtain the displacement 

of the tool when the speed commands are corrected. 
This displacement is added to the movement command 

inputted to the position loop, so as not to lose 
track of the tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
controlling electric discharge machining and an
apparatus therefor, which are applicable to an electric
discharge machining apparatus which generates electric
discharge by applying a voltage across a tool electrode
and a workpiece opposed to each other through a small
gap between them in a liquid; and are designed to adjust
the gap between the tool electrode and the workpiece to
the optimum condition by using a driving means such as a
servomotor in order to keep the electric discharge
condition constant during the machining operation
performed by the electric discharge machining apparatus.An electric discharge machining apparatus machines
a workpiece into a desired shape by relatively moving
a tool electrode with respect to the workpiece in
accordance with a programmed machining path while
removing the material of the workpiece by electric discharge
generated by applying a voltage across the tool
electrode and the workpiece. In the machining operation
performed by this electric discharge machining
apparatus, the electric discharge machining condition
must be kept constant, the electric discharge machining
condition being provided by the average working voltage
between the tool electrode and the workpiece (gap
voltage), the time taken from the application of voltage 
across the tool electrode and the workpiece to the
generation of electric discharge, or other factors. For
this purpose, the electric discharging gap is adjusted
by relatively moving the tool electrode with respect to
the workpiece in accordance with the detected electric
discharge machining condition.In the case of the conventional electric discharge
machining control apparatus, the electric discharging
gap is adjusted by giving the command for the position
of retraction of the tool electrode to the position
controller (hereinafter referred to as a
servomechanism), the position of retraction being
determined by determining the direction and distance of
the relative retraction of the tool electrode from the
workpiece depending on the detected electric discharge
machining condition. Such retracting direction, for
example, may be the direction opposite to the direction
of the relative movement of the tool electrode with
respect to the workpiece at the machining position, or
the direction perpendicular to the direction of the
relative movement of a wire electrode with respect to
the workpiece, that is, the direction normal to the work
surface like in the case of the finishing on a wire
electric
