<ABSTRACT>
Process for bending glass sheets, especially in pairs, in which the glass sheets undergo a prebending under the effect of gravity in a horizontal position on an annular concave bending former (3) whose outline corresponds to the desired definitive shape of the glass sheets, until the edge of the glass sheets is applied entirely onto the bending former (3). Next, with the aid of a solid convex bending former (11) which is applied over the whole of its surface and acts from above onto the glass sheets (2'), the internal part situated inside the edge of the sheets undergoes a supplementary bending which gives it the desired definitive shape, the glass sheets being pressed by suction against the solid convex bending former, at the edge of the solid convex bending former (11).

Process for bending at least one glass sheet, according to which the
glass sheet or sheets undergo, in the horizontal position on an annular,

concave bending mould (3) corresponding to the contour of the final desired
shape of the glass sheets, a prebending under the effect of gravity until

their edges are entirely applied to said annular bending mould (3), and
then undergo a complimentary bending giving them the desired final shape,

in the inner part located inside the peripheral portion with the aid of a
solid, convex bending mould (11, 31) acting from the top on the prebent

glass sheet or sheets and covering their entire surface, the glass sheet or
sheets being pressed against the solid, convex bending mould (11, 31) by

suction at the edge of said solid, convex bending mould (11, 31).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the different
bending stages take place simultaneously on two glass sheets.
Apparatus for the application of the process according to one of the
claims 1 or 2, comprising a bending furnace (1) equipped with several

annular, concave bending moulds (3), which can be displaced in the bending
furnace (1) in accordance with a predetermined rate, their upper peripheral

surface (8) corresponding to the desired final shape of the glass sheets in
their peripheral portion and a pressing bending station (10) installed at

the end of the bending furnace (1) in which, above the displacement plane
of the bending mould (3), a solid, upper, convex bending mould (11, 31) is

positioned so as to be raisable and lowerable, a suction gap (41) passing
along the periphery of the glass sheets being formed roughly level with

the bending surface (8) of the bending mould (3), between the solid, upper,
convex bending mould (11, 31) and a skirt (44), which is connected to a

wall (43) of an envelope (13, 40) surrounding the bending mould (11, 31),
and exhaust fans (16, 35) are placed above the envelope (13, 40).
