Use of an aqueous binder composition for the 
lamination of two or more layers of cellulose tissue 

fabrics having a weight per unit area of 18 to 25 g/m², 
characterized in that an aqueous binder composition 

having a viscosity of 600 to 35000 mPa.s is used which 
comprises 


a) 10 to 80 parts by weight of an aqueous plastics 
dispersion which has a solids content of 30 to 70 % 

by weight and is based on polymers of one or more 
monomers from the group consisting of acrylic acid 

esters, methacrylic acid esters, vinyl esters, 
olefins, vinyl halides, vinyl-aromatic compounds and 

ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and their 
amides, which optionally comprise 0 to 10 % by 

weight, with respect to the total weight of the 
polymer, of N-alkylamides and/or N-alkoxyalkylamides 

of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, 
b) 0.1 to 300 parts by weight of an organic or inorganic 
filler which is sparingly soluble in water and 

has an average particle size of 0.5 to 100 µm, and 
c) 0 to 4 parts by weight of a thickener and/or 0 to 
6 parts by weight of a dispersing agent. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
aqueous dispersions of vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymers, 

vinyl acetate/ethylene/N-methylol(meth)acrylamide 
terpolymers, alkyl acrylate/N-methylol(meth)acrylamide 

copolymers and vinyl acetate/ethylene/alkyl acrylate 
copolymers or vinyl acetate/alkyl acrylate copolymers, 

which optionally have an N-methylol(meth)acrylamide 
content, are present as component a). 
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymers which have a vinyl 

acetate content of 60 to 90 % by weight and an ethylene 
content of 10 to 40 % by weight, with respect to the 

total weight of the copolymer, or vinyl acetate/ethylene/N-methylolacrylamide 
terpolymers which have a 

vinyl acetate content of 60 to 90 % by weight, an ethylene 
content of 10 to 40 % by weight and an N-methylolacrylamide  

 
content of 1 to 10 % by weight, with respect 

to the total weight of the terpolymer, are present as 
component a). 
Use according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the aqueous plastics dispersions have a solids 

content of 45 to 55 % by weight. 
Use according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the proportion of plastics dispersion in 

the binder composition is 40 to 60 parts by weight. 
Use according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, characterized 
in that chalk, dolomite or barytes is used as 

component b). 
Use according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the thickeners used are polyacrylic 

acids and their salts, soluble cellulose derivatives, 
such as hydroxyethylcellulose, alginates or 

polyurethanes. 
Use according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the dispersing agents used are 

potassium, sodium or ammonium salts of polymeric carboxyl 
acids.
