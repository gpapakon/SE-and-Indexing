<ABSTRACT>
A belt system is disclosed for transferring a data carrier between a magazine and 
a data reader for use in a data carrier loader of the type wherein the data reader is 

moved, within the loader housing, over the stationary magazine in the housing to transfer 
a data carrier therebetween. The belt system includes two belt assemblies, which are 

carried on the data reader and which are disposed for engaging opposite lateral sides of 
a data carrier in the magazine. A mechanical linkage is provided for moving the 

assemblies toward and away from the lateral sides of the data carrier, the linkage being 
a reciprocating linkage which can be moved in either direction by means of an internally 

threaded element, which engages a pivotable element of the linkage, the internally 
threaded element being moved by a rotating threaded rod received therein. When the 

belt assemblies engage the data carrier, the belt is rotated in a selected direction either 
to lift the data carrier from the magazine into the reader or to remove the data carrier from 

the reader and replace it in the magazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to loaders for data carriers of the type wherein 
a magazine containing a plurality of data carriers is inserted into a loader housing, and 
a data reader is moved over the magazine to select a data carrier therefrom for insertion 
into the reader, and in particular to a belt system for loading a data carrier from the 
magazine into the reader, and thereafter replacing the data carrier in the magazine. It is known to record and store data on a number of different types of storage 
media, such as magnetic tape, optical disks and the like. Because of the limited size of 
such data carriers, the amount of data which can be stored thereon is similarly limited. 
In computing and data retrieval systems wherein a large amount of data is stored, a 
relatively large number of such data carriers are required in order to contain all of the 
necessary data. To retrieve the data from the data carrier, it is necessary to insert the 
carrier into a data reader, such as a tape drive unit. (As used herein, the unit into which 
the data carrier is inserted will be referred to as a "reader," although it may also be used 
for the purpose of writing data on the carrier.) In systems requiring multiple data carriers, it is cumbersome to manually 
successively insert and remove the data carriers from the reader. Many such systems, 
therefore, employ a data carrier magazine, which holds a large number of data carriers, 
with the magazine being loadable into a device which contains the reader. A selected 
data carrier can then be automatically removed from the magazine, and automatically 
inserted into the reader wherein the data on the carrier is read, or new data is written on 
the carrier. After completion of the read or write operation, the data carrier is then  
 
automatically removed from the reader and is replaced in the magazine. The overall unit, 
which includes the magazine, the data reader, and an automated mechanism for 
removing the data carrier from the magazine, inserting it into the reader, and removing 
it from the reader and replacing it in the magazine, is generically known as a "loader." 
Loaders can generally be classified into three types: Those in which the magazine is 
stationary in the loader and the drive is moved over the magazine to the position of a 
selected data carrier in the magazine, those wherein the reader is stationary and the 
magazine is moved to position a selected data carrier at a location for insertion in the 
reader, and those wherein both the

<CLAIMS>
A loader (1) for use with data carriers (8) having front 
(23) and rear faces (58) and lateral sides, said loader 

comprising: 

a housing (2;) 
means (7) for inserting a plurality of upright data 
carriers (8) disposed side by side, into a region of 

said housing, 
said means (7) for inserting data carriers (8) being 

disposed with at least a portion of said lateral sides 
of each data carrier being exposed in said region; 
a data reader (10) movably supported in said housing (2) 
above said region; 
drive means (13, 14) for moving said data reader (10) 
over said region to a location above a selected data 

carrier (8) to be transferred between said region and

including first and second wheels (19, 20) with an 

elastic belt (12) entrained around said wheels (19, 
20), and one wheel in each said assembly being drivable 

in opposite directions for moving the respective belts 
(12) of said assemblies (11) to lift a data carrier (8) 

from said region into said data reader (10) and return a 
data carrier (8) from said data reader (10) to said 

region; 
 
characterized in that 


said transfer assemblies (11) are carried on said data 
reader (10) disposed for respectively engaging said 

exposed lateral sides of a data carrier (8) over which
