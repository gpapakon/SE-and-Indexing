<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for producing a permanent 
connection between a trace (10), such as platinum, of a 

substrate (2) is provided by placing a silver ring (11) 
over the trace (10) and placing a current lead (4) over 

the ring (11). This assembly is then heated, whereby the 
platinum is dissolved in the silver forming an alloy 

having a higher melting point than the silver. 
Preferably, a ceramic housing (6,6',8,) surrounds the 

interconnection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical 
connection and a method for producing the connection, for 
use in high temperature applications, and in particular in 
applications relating to connection to catalytic 
converters. Automotive catalytic converters include a substrate 
having printed at the edges thereof, a printed circuit pad 
is provided, which could be a noble metal, such as 
platinum printing, and to which, a connection must be 
made. The difficulty in providing this electrical 
connection, is that a current lead must be interconnected 
to the circuit pad. Standard electrical connectors are 
not useable in such applications as the operating 
temperatures can reach as high as 950°C. Standard 
metallic materials show rapid stress relaxation in such 
applications leading to loss of contact force. A 
permanent connection is needed which can withstand such 
high temperatures, and a connection such as high 
temperature soldering can also be considered, but the 
melting point of the solder is to close to the operating 
temperature. The object of the invention then is to provide an 
electrical connection for use at higher temperatures. It is a further object of the invention to provide an 
electrical connection between a current lead of a 
substrate for use at high temperature operating 
conditions. The objects of the invention have been accomplished 
by a method of providing a permanent interconnection 
between a substrate trace and a current lead, which method 
is characterized by the steps of placing a precious metal 
intermediate the circuit trace and the current lead; 
heating the precious metal, the circuit trace and current  
 
lead to a first temperature where the precious metal 
melts, whereby the precious metal forms an alloy with the 
material of the circuit trace having a melting point at a 
second temperature which is higher than the first 
temperature. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by 
way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figure 1 is an isometric view of a first embodiment 
of the invention; Figure 1A is an isometric view of a precious metal 
component for incorporation in the first embodiment of 
Figure 1; Figure 2 is an isometric view of a ceramic housing 
half; Figure 3 is an isometric view of the connector half 
shown in Figure 2 from the opposite side thereof; Figure 4 is a cross sectional view through the 
assembly of Figure 1; Figure 5 is a top plan view of an alternative 
embodiment of the invention of Figure
