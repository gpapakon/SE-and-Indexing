<ABSTRACT>
An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) drill jig probe comprises a location portion (10) for securing in an ACL drill jig, a shank (11) extending from the location portion for passing one side of the patella tendon, and a horn (12) extending from a junction (13) with the shank (11) at an obtuse angle (OE) for location against the posterior part of the intercondylar notch as the anatomical reference point for an ACL drill jig with which the probe is to be used. The shank (11) has two lateral bends (16, 17) in opposite directions, both to facilitate passing of the shank round the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle and the patella tendon and to allow ready use of the probe with an existing coplanar ACL drill jig. A set of instruments comprises at least two interchangeable probes, one for a left knee and one for a right knee, with opposite handed bends (16, 17), and a coplanar ACL drill jig.

<DESCRIPTION>
POSITIONING PROBE FOR A DRILL JIG IN KNEE SURGERYThis invention relates to knee surgery, more particularly to replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament, hereafter referred to as ACL.A synthetic scaffold-type ACL replacement such as that known by the trade mark ABC of Surgicraft Limited comprising carbon and polyester fibres in a braided zigzag structure has proved successful. Mode of failure analysis using electron- microscopy has shown that most failures (between 9% and 12% over the past 6 years) occur at the internal exit of the tibial drill hole.Two surgically-avoidable mechanisms have been elucidated; crushing of the fibres by impingement between the roof of the intercondylar notch and the edge of the drill hole in extension; and, fatigue damage due to repetitive tension over the sharp edge of the tibial drill hole.Crushing and fatigue damage can be avoided by the use of a substantial radius cutter for the tibial drill hole.Failure by notch impingement can be avoided by ensuring that the tibial drill hole is positioned posterior to the roof of the intercondylar notch when the knee is in full extension, and so the object of the present invention is to provide a drill jig probe which facilitates the correct positioning of the tibial drill hole without direct visualisation (arthrotomy) or indirect visualisation (arthroscopy) .According to the present invention, an ACL drill jig probe comprises a location portion for securing in an ACL 

drill jig, a shank extending from the location portion for passing one side of the patella tendon, and a horn extending from a junction with the shank at an obtuse angle for location against the posterior part of the intercondylar notch as the anatomical reference point for an ACL drill jig with which the probe is to be used.The shank and the horn are conveniently formed integrally by a length of round rod, e.g. of stainless steel of 4.0mm diameter, but may be of semicircular or other cross- section, with a bend (which may be slightly curved) at the junction between the shank and the horn, and the free end of the horn is preferably rounded-off. The other end of the shank (i.e. remote from the horn) is conveniently secured in a hole in one end of the location portion, which preferably consists of a length of square-section bar, e.g., of stainless steel of 8.0 mm lateral dimensions, with the corners and ends bevelled or rounded-off, and with at least one semicircular notch in one side for secure location in an ACL drill jig with which the probe is to be used.

CLAIMS
1. An ACL drill jig probe comprising a location portion for securing in an ACL drill jig, a shank extending from the location portion for passing one side of the patella tendon, and a horn extending from a junction with the shank at an obtuse angle for location against the posterior part of the intercondylar notch as the anatomical reference point for an ACL drill jig with which the probe is to be used.
2. A probe as in Claim 1, wherein the shank and the horn are formed integrally by a length of round rod with a bend at the junction between the shank and the horn.
3. A probe as in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the bend is slightly curved.
4. A probe as in any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the free end of the horn is rounded off. 5. A probe as in any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the other end of the shank is secured in a hole in one end of the location portion.
6. A probe as in any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the location portion consists of a length of square-section bar, with the corners and ends bevelled or rounded-off, and with a semicircular notch in one side for secure location in an ACL drill jig with which the probe is to be used.
7. A probe as in Claim 6, wherein the location portion is provided with a second semicircular notch of larger diameter than the other notch.
8. A probe as in any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein the shank is straight and coaxial with the location portion. 


 9. A probe as in any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein the shank has at least one lateral bend to facilitate passing of the shank round the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle and the patella tendon. 10. A probe as in Claim 9, wherein the shank has two lateral bends in opposite directions, both to facilitate passing of the shank round the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle and the patella tendon and to allow ready use of the probe with an existing coplanar ACL drill jig, so that o the tibial drill hole will have an axis oblique in three dimensions to the axis of the horn of the probe and with its exit end axially aligned below a point on the horn above its junction with the shank, which ensures correct positioning of the tibia drill hole. 5 11. A probe as in Claim 9 or Claim 10, wherein the or each lateral bend is slightly curved.
12. A set of instruments comprising at least two interchangeable ACL drill jig probes as defined in any one of Claims 9 to 11, one for a left knee and one for a right knee, 0 and a coplanar ACL drill jig.
13. A set of instruments as in Claim 12 comprising a plurality of interchangeable probes for a range of dimensions of left knees and a range of dimensions of right knees.
