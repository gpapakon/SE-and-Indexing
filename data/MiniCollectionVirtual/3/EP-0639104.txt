<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for separating solid and or liquid particles, especially of small diameter, and/or gaseous components from a stream of gas by means of particle separation units, the separation action of which is supported by the use of very finely atomized washing liquid, in that the stream of gas is taken to one or more adjacent or successive similar or different particle separation units, into the gas intake of which washing liquid is sprayed in the direction of gas flow immediately in front of the separation unit by means of one or more pneumatic dual-substance nozzles.

A process for separating solid and/or liquid
particles, in particular of small diameter, and/or gaseous

components from a gas stream by particle-separation units
(1,11,18,19) through which gas flows, the separating action

of which is assisted by the use of very finely atomised
washing liquid, wherein the gas stream is fed to one or more

particle-separation units (1,11,18,19) arranged side by side
and/or successively, and into the gas inlet (2) of which

unit or units washing liquid is sprayed in the gas stream
direction directly upstream of each particle-separation unit

more pneumatic two component nozzles (4,15,28) supplied

separately with atomising gas and washing liquid,
characterised in that before the admission of the washing
