<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing silver halide emulsion which 
comprises silver halide grains containing an average iodide 

content of not more than 2 mol% comprising the steps of 
(i) preparing a seed emulsion containing silver halide seed 

grains, (ii) introducing the seed emulsion into a reaction 
vessel containing a hydrophilic colloid solution and (iii) 

introducing into the reaction vessel a silver salt and a 
halide salt to grow the silver halide grains from the seed 

grains, wherein in the step (iii), an emulsion containing 
silver iodide fine grains previously formed is supplied into 

the reaction vessel as a sourse of silver iodide; said seed 
grains are contained in an amount of 0.5 to 5.0% by volume in 

the hydrophilic colloid solution in the reaction vessel prior 
to introduction of silver and halide salts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a
silver halide photographic emulsion, more specifically a
method of producing a silver halide photographic emulsion of
low fogging and high sensitivity showing improved storage
stability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions.In recent years, there has been increased consumption of
silver halide photographic light-sensitive materials.
Accordingly, the number of silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material films processed has increased; there is a
need for more rapid processing, i.e., increased processing-capacity
per unit time period.This trend is seen in all fields of light-sensitive
materials. In the field of medical X-ray light-sensitive
materials, for example, the rapid increase in medical 
examinations and testing parameters is increasing the number
of X-ray photographs taken, while the diagnostic results must
be informed for the subject as soon as possible. To meet this
requirement, rapid processing is required. In angiographic
picture taking and perioperative picture taking, in
particular, it is necessary to obtain the picture in minimum
time.To meet the above demand from the medical field, it is
necessary to more rapidly process X-ray films, as well as to
promote diagnostic automation (picture taking, film transport,
etc.).Ultrarapid processing, however, can pose a problem of
image quality deterioration because it is often performed
under high-pH, high-temperature (30 to 40Â°C) conditions.To meet the above demand for rapid processing and high
image quality, tabular silver halide grains have recently been
used. With high specific surface area, tabular silver halide
grains are unique in that they can adsorb large amounts of
sensitizing dyes and can therefore have improved spectral
sensitivity, that they significantly reduce crossover light as
in X-ray light-sensitive materials, and that images of high
resolution with little light scattering are obtained. The use
of such tabular grains is expected to offer silver halide
photographic light-sensitive materials of high sensitivity and
high image quality. Investigations by the present inventors
showed, however, that tabular grains have a major drawback 
that their storage stability under high-temperature, high-humidity
conditions is poor so that they are liable to be
fogged and desensitized.European Patent Application No. 0 598326
