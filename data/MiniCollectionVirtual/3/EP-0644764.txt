<ABSTRACT>
Disorders of the skin and mucous membrane that have a disrupted or dysfunctional epidermal barrier are treated or prevented by topical application of a formulation comprising certain of the three major epidermal lipid species or their structurally similar precursors, isomers, or analogs in certain proportion ranges. This invention utilizes the following lipid species in unique combinations of two or more components; cholesterol, an acylceramide, a ceramide, and essential and nonessential fatty acids. These combinations are effective both as moisturizing agents and agents for the restoration of barrier function. Some of these combinations are further enhanced by the addition of known moisturizers such as petrolatum and glycerine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention resides in the area of topical formulations for application to skin
for repair of the epidermal barrier function. In
particular, this invention relates to the application of lipids and lipid formulations and to
the treatment of subjects suffering from skin or mucous membrane diseases or disorders
which display epidermal hyperproliferation and disruptions of the barrier function.The skin is the largest organ of the body and protects mammalian organisms from
both aqueous and xerotic ambient environments. The maintenance of a barrier against
excessive transcutaneous water loss to the environment is critical to survival of all
terrestrial animals. In mammals, this barrier is formed by the anucleate, cornified,
outermost layers of the epidermis, collectively known as the stratum corneum. Both the
surfaces of mucous membranes and the deepest layers of the stratum corneum contain high
concentrations of glycosphingolipids which are metabotized progressively to ceramides as
the stratum granulosum becomes anucleate with outward maturation. Localized or
generalized perturbations of the epidermal barrier occur in a variety of diseases and
conditions of the skin and mucous membrane. These perturbations not only contribute
significantly to the morphology of the cutaneous lesions, but also activate certain skin
diseases, for example the Koebner phenomenon in psoriasis. Common moisturizers and
emollients also cause disruptions of the barrier functionIt is now generally accepted that the intercellular lamellar bilayer sheets of stratum
corneum lipids are the key constituents for a functional barrier. The epidermal lipids
consist of a mixture of polar and nonpolar species. The three dominant lipids by weight
are ceramides (40%), cholesterol (20-25%) and free fatty acids (20-25%). The latter
group include the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, is well as additional nonessential fatty
acids. The human epidermis further contains a unique acylsphingolipid whose molecular
structure includes a sptungoid backbone with a 30-carbon, α-hydroxy acid residue joined to
the backbone through an amide linkage, the residue itself being ω-esterified with linoleic
acid. Although each of the lipid species is important for stratum corneum
homeostasis, ceramides are of particular importance because of their large weight
contribution and structural characteristics. The moisturization properties of
ceramides are known. A published Japanese patent application of Kao Company
Limited (No. 24391-1987) discloses a formulation
