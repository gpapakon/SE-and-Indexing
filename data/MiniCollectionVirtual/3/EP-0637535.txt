<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rail brake system for marshalling yards, having at least one group of brake elements (5) which are attached one behind the other to the rail web and can be moved out of an inactive home position into an active braking position using an electric control, at least one control line which is common to all the brake elements (5) and to which actuator elements (9) which are assigned to the brake elements (5) are connected being provided. The electric connection power of such a rail brake system is substantially reduced by providing a locking line (V) and an unlocking line (E), by assigning to each actuator element (9) a locking switch (II) which is actuated thereby and arranged in the locking line (V), and an unlocking switch (I) which is actuated thereby and arranged in the unlocking line (E), and by connecting the actuator elements (9) electrically into the circuit which leads from the switches to a return line (R) in such a way that the actuator elements (9) are actuated successively in a cascade-like manner. Alternatively, the invention provides for the actuator elements (9) to engage on associated locking elements (8) which can be moved between a position of rest in which they are disengaged from the brake elements (5), and a locking position in which they hold the brake elements (5) in the inactive home position.

<CLAIMS>
A track brake for a marshalling plant comprised of at least one group of several 
brake elements (5) affixed one behind the other to the rail web, said elements 

being movable with an electric control from an inactive base position into an 
active brake position, with at least one common line being provided for all brake 

elements (5) which the actuator elements (9) allocated to the brake elements (5) 
are connected to, 
characterized in that
 a locking line (V) and an unlocking line 
(E) are provided for, and that a locking switch (II) operable by it and located in 

the locking line (V) is allocated to each actuator element (9) and that an 
unlocking switch (I) operable by it and located in the unlocking line (E) is 

allocated to each actuator element (9), with the locking switches (II) being 
connected to a common feedback line (R) if being in unlocked position and 

connecting the neighbouring sections of the locking line (V) if being in locked 
position, with the unlocking switches (I) being connected to the common 

feedback line if being in locked status and connecting the neighbouring sections 
of the unlocking line (E) if being in unlocked status, and that the actuator 

elements (9) are electrically switched into the power circuits leading from the 
switches (I, II) to the feedback line (R). 
A track brake as per Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the actuator elements (9) 
are equipped with a coil (S) lying in the power circuit. 
A track brake as per Claim 1 or 2, 
characaterized in that
 one coil (S) each is 
located in every power circuit formed with the locking line (V) and/or unlocking 

line (E). 
A track brake as per Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 one coil (S) each is 
located in every power circuit formed with the locking line (V) or unlocking line 

(E) and that a diode (D1, D2) connected to the coil (S) is located in the other 
power circuit allocated to the pertaining actuator element (9). 
A track brake for marshalling plants comprised of at least one group of several 
brake elements affixed one behind the other to the rail web, said elements being 

movable with an electric control from an inactive base position into an active 
brake position, with at least one common line being provided for all brake 

elements (5) which the actuator elements (9) allocated to the brake elements (5) 
are connected to, 
characterized in that
 the actuator elements (9) engage at 
allocated locking elements (8) which are swivable between a rest position in 

which they are out of engagement with the brake elements (5) and a locking 
position in which they keep the brake elements (5) in their inactive base position, 

and that the actuator elements (9) and/or locking elements (8) are supported on a 
spring which presses the locking elements (8) into a stable locking position, with 

said actuator elements (8) being kept in a stable rest position with a permanent 
magnet (11) charged by the coil (S).  

 
A track brake as per any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 each 
locking element (8) if being in locking position is supported on the upper side of 

the brake element (5) preferably through horizontally mounted cylindrical rollers 
(16). 
A track brake as per Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the force component of the 
brake element reset force acting in the direction of the locking elements (8) at 

horizontally mounted rollers (16) does not act in the direction of the rest position.
