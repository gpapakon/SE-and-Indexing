<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for inspecting and sorting molded 
containers (C), such as glass bottles that includes a finished 

product inspection station (14) for inspecting containers 
transported in sequence along a predetermined path, identifying 

containers to be sorted from the path on the basis of container 
mold of origin, and providing an electrical signal indicative 

of such containers. A conveyor (28) is disposed adjacent to 
the container path downstream of the finished product inspection 

station, and is responsive to an electronic control signal for 
selectively removing a container from the path as the container 

passes adjacent to the conveyor. A timer (98) receives the 
electrical signal from the inspection station, and applies the 

electronic control signal to the conveyor after a time delay 
coordinated with distance between the inspection station and 

the conveyor, and velocity of travel of containers along the 
path between the inspection station and the conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a system for
inspecting and sorting containers according to the preamble
of claim 1.The system of the preamble of claim 1 is known from
EP-A-0 356 645 and includes a rotating conveyor for
transferring bottles to a rotating sorting conveyor which
outputs the bottles to one or the other of two further
conveyors. For the control thereof, valve elements each
having a shaft as a spool are provided and acted upon by the
end of a vertical shaft of control means. Thus, the control
means must be made effective for every bottle passing
through the system.Manufacturing variations in molded containers, such
as glass bottles and jars, are often related to variations
in the associated molds of origin. For this reason, it is
desirable in an automated manufacturing operation having a
plurality of molds to possess the ability of identifying a
specific molded container with its mold of origin, and of
associating container manufacturing variations with molds of
origin for repair or replacement purposes. In an automated
plant for manufacturing glass bottles, for example, a
machine termed an individual section or IS machine includes
a multiplicity of mold cavities and automated apparatus for
feeding glass gobs to successive molds to blow the
containers. The blown containers are then fed by suitable
conveying apparatus to a lehr where annealing takes place,
and then to a so-called cold end where inspection and
sorting are performed prior to packaging of the containers
for shipment. In view of the processing delay between the
molding and inspection operations, it is desirable to
identify potentially defective mold cavities at an early
time in order to reduce scrap. In the same way, it is 
desirable after a mold cavity has been replaced or repaired
closely to inspect containers from that cavity in order to
certify proper operation.US-A-4,413,738 discloses a system for one hundred
percent inspection of molded containers for sidewall and
finish variations, and for automatically sorting containers
from mold cavities that are identified as defective. Each
container is routed through one of a plurality of multi-station
inspection devices for automated optical inspection
of container sidewall and finish. A primary one of the
inspection devices includes or has associated therewith an
automated cavity inspection device or CID for reading a code
molded onto each container and thereby associating
containers passing through that inspection device with molds
of origin. A finished product computer

<CLAIMS>
A system (10) for inspecting and sorting containers (C)
comprising:


means (12, 26) for transporting containers in
sequence along a predetermined path,
means (14) for inspecting containers traveling in
said path, identifying containers to be sorted from said

path and providing an electrical signal indicative
thereof,
a starwheel turret (30) having circumferentially
spaced pockets sized to receive the containers, means

(46, 50, 52, 54) for rotating said turret about a fixed
axis adjacent to said path downstream of said inspecting

means, a vacuum body (44) rotatable conjointly and
coaxially with said starwheel turret,
a plurality of resilient vacuum cups (64) mounted in
a circumferential array on said vacuum body within said

pockets,
a plurality of passage means (72) in said vacuum body
individually operatively coupled to said cups and

opening at an external face of said vacuum body,
vacuum means (56, 57) coupled to said vacuum body for
applying a vacuum to all of said passage means,
a plurality of valve spools (70) each disposed in an
associated one of said passage means, each of said valve

spools being adapted for sealingly engaging said passage
means to define a vacuum-blocking position of said valve

spool (70) when said valve spool is in a first position
for blocking application of vacuum to the associated cup

and a vacuum-enabling position when said valve spool
(70) is in a second position for applying a vacuum to

the associated cup and thereby holding a container
within the associated starwheel pocket,
means (84, 92) for driving said spools (70) into said
vacuum-blocking position and into said vacuum-enabling 

position, said driving means (84, 92) being disposed
adjacent to said turret (30) and include means (84, 86,

88) responsive to an electronic control signal for
engaging a respective one of said valve spools (70) and
