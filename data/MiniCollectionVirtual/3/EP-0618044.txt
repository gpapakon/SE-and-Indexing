<ABSTRACT>
A cutter apparatus (30) comprising an on-the-sleigh 
robot (20), a motor (23) having a vertical output shaft 

and capable of shifting vertically, a rotary cutter (1) 
detachably connected at the end of the output shaft of 

the motor, and a cordless TV camera (21) installed on 
the robot. In particular, the rotary cutter (1) has a 

disk-shaped support plate (4), whose side surface is 
abrasive, upper and lower disks (2, 3) parallel to each 

other, which are arranged in a row in axial direction to 
sandwich the support plate inbetween and whose exposed 

faces, respectively, are abrasive, a tapered reamer (5) 
extending axially upward from the center of the upper 

disk, and a binder assembly (8, 9, 14) to bind the 
tapered reamer, the upper and lower disks, and the 

support plate together and to fix the rotary cutter 
about an output shaft of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary cutter and a cutting
apparatus equipped with the rotary cutter.US-A-2 978 846 discloses a rotary cutter having an axis of
rotation and comprising an abrasive disk, a tapered drill means
extending axially from the disk, and a binder assembly to bind
said tapered drill means and said disk detachably together and
to fix said rotary cutter about an output shaft of a rotary
drive means detachably. The cutter according to the invention 
can be used
conveniently and effectively in a pipe line repair operation
wherein a lining material is applied to the inner wall of the pipe
which has a second pipe branching thereoff. The cutter apparatus
of the present invention has the rotary cutter which can be shifted
vertically, and can cut with its side surface as well as its top
and bottom surfaces.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to this publication, this method of pipe repair comprises
inserting a sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the
pipe to be repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or
water. The tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent
material impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer
surface covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed end 
of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open end of
the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked (anchored) at
the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner such that the
wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly covers and
closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed into the
pipe; then, the pressurized fluid is applied to the said portion of
the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular liner to
enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is hooked at
the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of the
flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper in
the pipe.
