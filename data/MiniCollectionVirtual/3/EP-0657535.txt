<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DNA sequence of a gene 
coding a lipase originated from Pseudomonas bacteria, 
a recombinant DNA containing the DNA sequence, and 
a process for cultivating a host species bacterium 
transformed by the recombinant DNA and secretorily 
producing a lipase into the cultured filtrate. Lipase has been used as an enzyme for hydrolyzing 
lipids, for oil and fat processing, clinical dignostic, 
detergent, digestant, etc., and besides, in recent years, 
it is an important enzyme for catalyzing ester hydrolysis, 
ester synthesis, or ester interchange, as a process for 
producing chemical products, particularly optically active 
compounds. Further, Pseudomonas genus bacteria have been known 
to produce a lipase useful as a catalyst for ester 
hydrolysis, ester synthesis or ester interchange (see 
Japanese patent application laid-open No. Sho 62-166898). 
Further, these lipases have been utilized industrially 
in a large quantity. Thus, lipases for industrial enzymes 
have been desired to be supplied in a cheap cost, besides  
 
heat stability and characteristic substrate-specificity. In recent years, due to development of recombinant DNA 
technique, genes coding enzemes which have industrial utility 
value have been isolated, and their DNA sequences have 
been clarified. Further, making use of the technique, 
it has been studied or carried out to produce enzymes 
having improved the production efficiency and having 
improved the stability to heat, organic solvents, etc. 
or those characteristic of substrate-specificity. As to 
lipase originated from Pseudomonas genus bacteria, too, 
the genes thereof have been isolated and the primary 
structure thereof and a process for producing recombinant 
lipases have been reported (see Japanese patent application 
laid-open Nos. Sho 63-187684, Sho 64-74992, Hei 2-190188 
and Hei 3-47079). As to these lipases, Escherichiacoli advantageous 
to produce recombinant proteins has been used as a host 
species bacterium because various factors for producing 
the lipases have been known and a number of expression 
Proteins therefor, etc. have been developed. However, 
such conventional processes have been characterized in that 
recombinant lipases have been produced by crushing 
Escherichiacoli by means of supersonic wave treatment, 
etc.; hence such processes are disadvantageous in the 
aspect of commercial production. Accordingly, it has 
been required to develop a host species bacterium having  
 
DNA characterized by secretorily produce a lipase into
