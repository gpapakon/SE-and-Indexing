<DESCRIPTION>
 ANIMAL EXHALATION MONITORINGThe present invention relates to the monitoring of the exhalation of an animal in order to provide information about the animal. The information can relate to health, diet or other condition. The animal can be farm livestock such as cattle, domesticated animals such as cats, dogs and horses or poultry such as turkeys and chickens.Animals produce exhalations some of which are odours such as those from the skin, breath, milk and solid and liquid waste products. It is important that any monitoring is based on an accurately taken sample. GB 2272773 A discloses a method for the examination of the condition of a ruminant animal including sampling odours from at least one part of the animal with an olfactory sensor thereby to identify a specific aspect ofthe animal condition and apparatus to examine a ruminant animal including means to collect breath or other flow containing an odour ofthe animal as a sample, means to purge said collecting means, sensing means to receive said sample and identify at least one specific condition ofthe animal and means to supply an indication of said condition. The method and apparatus may be used to detect conditions such as oestrus, ketosis and other metabolic disorders of ruminant animals in general.GB 2272626A discloses the use of an olfactory sensor for the checking of any residual contamination after a teat cleaning operation. Purge air or gas can be used.It is an object of the present invention to provide an effective technique for monitoring livestock on the basis of exhalation from the livestock. Exhalation includes breath from the animal, vapour from milk or any other volatile materials emanating therefrom. Condition can be determined from a component of the exhalation, which component may be an odour or specific compound or other material. The composition of such exhalation can provide a valuable source of information regarding the animal's state of health. The determination ofthe presence of a particular component in the exhalation can be used to identify an animal's condition.In a first aspect ofthe present invention there is provided apparatus for collecting an exhalation sample comprising a housing having inlet and outlet means; a flow path between the inlet and outlet means; and a collapsible container positioned within the 

housing and in communication with said flow path; means for introducing the sample to the apparatus and means for expelling the sample from the apparatus. It is particularly preferred that the means for
