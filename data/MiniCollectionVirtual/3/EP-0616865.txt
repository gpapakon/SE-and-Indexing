<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic confining apparatus (20) prevents 
the escape of molten metal through the open side of 

a vertically extending gap (25) between two horizontally 
separated members (21,22) and in which the molten metal is 

located. The apparatus includes a current 
conducting coil (30) for generating a horizontal magnetic 

field and non-magnetic fins (44) for concentrating the 
current in the surface of the coil (30) which is closest 

to the open side of the gap (25). The magnetic field 
generated by the apparatus extends through the open 

side of the gap (25) and exerts a confining pressure 
against the molten metal in the gap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
an improvement on the apparatuses and methods for
magnetically confining molten metal which are
disclosed in said antecedent applications. More
particularly, this application discloses an improved
method and apparatus for preventing the escape of
molten metal through the open side of a vertically
extending gap between two horizontally separated
members and in which the molten metal is located.The present invention is intended to
operate in the same environment as that disclosed in
the parent application, e.g., a twin-roll,
continuous-casting apparatus. While the apparatus
disclosed in the parent application is effective in
preventing molten metal from escaping through the
open side of a gap between two horizontally
separated casting rollers, the improved apparatus of
the present invention is designed to accomplish the
same task more efficiently.The twin-roll continuous casting
environment in which the present invention is
intended to operate typically comprises a pair of
horizontally spaced rolls mounted for rotation in
opposite rotational senses about respective
horizontal axes. The two rolls define a
horizontally extending gap therebetween for
receiving the molten metal. The gap defined by the
rolls tapers in a downward direction. The rolls are 
cooled, and in turn cool the molten metal as the
molten metal descends through the gap.The gap has horizontally spaced, open
opposite ends adjacent the ends of the two rolls.
The molten metal is unconfined by the rolls at the
open ends of the gap. To prevent molten metal from
escaping outwardly through the open ends of the gap,
mechanical dams or seals have been employed.Mechanical dams have drawbacks because the
dam is in physical contact with both the rotating
rolls and the molten metal. As a result, the dam is
subject to wear, leaking, and breakage, and can
cause freezing and large thermal gradients in the
molten metal. Moreover, contact between the
mechanical dam and the solidifying metal can cause
irregularities along the edges of metal strip cast
in this manner, thereby offsetting the advantages of
continuous casting over the conventional method of
rolling metal strip from a thicker, solid entity.The advantages obtained from the
continuous casting of metal strip, and the
disadvantages arising from the use of mechanical
dams or seals are described in more detail in Praeg
U.S. Patent No. 4,936,374 and in Lari et al. U.S.
Patent No. 4,974,661, and the disclosures of each of
these patents are incorporated herein by
