<ABSTRACT>
Peptides having high activity in the eliciting of a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 are described. The activation of 12-15 residue peptides by proteolytic degradation to shorter peptides is shown as are general techniques for characterizing such activation processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
POTENT PEPTIDE FOR STIMULATION OF CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES SPECIFIC FOR THE HIV-1 ENVELOPERELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a Continuation-In-Part application of the U.S. patent application bearing Serial Number 07/760,530, filed on September 18, 1991, which is in turn a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. patent application 07/148,692, filed on January 26,1988. These applications are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention relates to peptides useful as vaccines for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection in humans, to compositions incorporating such peptides and to methods for the administration of such vaccines. Related ArtThis application makes reference to various literature publications, which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. Live virus vaccines and killed whole or subunit virus vaccines for AIDS have potential safety risks. In contrast, synthetic peptides are inherently safe. Furthermore, molecules 

corresponding to whole viral proteins but made by recombinant DNA technology contain, in addition to protective epitopes, structures which potentially will elicit suppression of the immune response, or which will elicit antibodies that, rather than being protective, may enhance viral uptake and thus be deleterious. A vaccine which contains only selected peptides that elicit the appropriate type of immunity and do not have other deleterious effects should be more effective for a difficult virus such as HIV.Our previous work showed that the major CTL antigenic determinant of HIV-l envelope protein gp 160 consisted of residues 315-329 in the numbering sequence of Ratner et al. (27) , However, we have now found that this peptide does not bind intact to the class I MHC molecule that must present it to CTL, but rather it must first be proteolytically cleaved, by proteases such as those present in serum.T-cell stimulation by the HIV-l gpl60-derived pl8 peptide presently by H-2Dd class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in a cell-free system was found to require proteolytic cleavage. This extracellular processing was mediated by peptidases present in fetal calf serum (FCS) . In vitro processing of pl8 resulted in a distinct reverse phase HPLC profile, from which a biologically active product was isolated and sequenced. This peptide processing can be specifically blocked by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril and can occur by exposing pl8 to
