<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cartridge storing case for storing cartridges
into which developed films are wound to be accommodated.Conventionally, a developed film is cut into some pieces and stored in a
pouch of translucent film (hereinafter refer to as "film sheet"). The volume of
such kind of film sheet is large so that storage of many developed films makes
a considerable volume. Additionally, finding out of a specific film for a
specific print takes a lot of time since users must hold the films directly to the
light. Further, films stored in film sheets is likely to be folded.There has been proposed to store a developed film in a cartridge which
previously contained the undeveloped film or another cartridge. Thus, time
and labor for cutting the developed film into some pieces can be omitted and
expendable film sheets become unnecessary. In addition, cartridges can be
reused, therefore the proposal fits the object of enviromental protection
which is one of the most important themes in the world.US-A-4,819,794 and US-A-4,723,655 both disclose a storage case for storing
film cartridges used for photographic films including a housing which defines
a cavity for receiving a plurality of film spools. But the only function of both
storage cases is to store the films and not to archive the films.However, when a developed film is contained in such a cartridge, users cannot see
the content of the developed film; consequently, they cannot find out a
specific film immediately when they need the films. Also cartridges are
compact, but are not formed flat so that they cannot be stored in bookcases
and the like, which in turn causes a problem that they are likely to be lost.In view of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a cartridge storing case capable of efficiently containing and
archiving cartridges of films at the same time.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a cartridge
storing case having at least one recess designed to contain a cartridge into
which a roll of film is wound to be accommodated and having a containing
portion for index prints showing the contents of the films accommodated in
the cartridges. It is preferable that the containing portion for index prints comprises a recess
of approximately rectangular parallelepiped shape having a plurality of
partitions.In accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a cartridge
storing case having at least one recess designed to contain a cartridge into
which a roll of film
