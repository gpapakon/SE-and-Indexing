<ABSTRACT>
A die for injection molding for charging molten 
resin (114) onto a surface material (113) set 

on the cavity surface is disclosed. The die 
comprises direction changing means (122) for 

changing the direction of flow of the molten 
resin charged through the gate (111) to directions 

along the surface of the surface material (113). 
The direction changing means may be a 

substantially conical direction changing 
member (122) for changing the direction of flow of the 

molten resin. Since the direction changing 

means (122) can change the direction of flow of the 
molten resin charged into the die, which is 

completely closed or slightly open, to directions 
along the surface of the surface material (113), 

the molten resin does not strike the surface 
material. Thus, damage to the surface material 

in the neighborhood of the gate can be 
prevented, and the surface material can be 

protected against the collision with molten resin 
which is at a high temperature and under a high pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to injection molding dies and is applicable to the
manufacture of resin products, for which appearance quality is required, such as inner and
outer automobile fittings, for instance dashboards, door panels, etc.Laminar structure moldings are well known in the art, which have an integral
laminated surface material. With the laminar structure of molding, it is possible to obtain
satisfactory appearance and also excellent cushioning property owing to the surface
material. A further advantage is obtainable that the touch or sense of the product surface
can be readily changed by changing the sole surface material.Such molding is obtainable by charging a molten resin onto a surface material,
such as a sheet or a film, which has been set in a die cavity in advance.However, in the prior art injection molding die the molten resin is charged at a
high temperature and under a high pressure. Therefore, when the molten resin is charged
with the die held imperfectly closed or slightly open from the perfectly closed state
(hereinafter referred to as "slightly open state"), as shown in Fig. 22, the molten resin 62
flowing into the cavity 61 of the die 60 strikes the surface material 63 set in the cavity 61
while it is at a high temperature and under a high pressure. Therefore, the surface material
63 may be damaged, thus resulting in deterioration of the appearance of the product
molding or loss of the cushioning property of the product.To prevent such damage to the surface material, it is thought to charge the molten
resin into the die for injection compression molding with the die held open to a large extent
so that the molten resin may be sufficiently reduced in pressure and cooled down until
reaching the surface material.However, when the molten resin is cooled due to the large extent open state of the
die, the fluidity of the molten resin is deteriorated to spoil the moldability. In addition,
causing forced flow of the molten resin with the deteriorated fluidity makes the surface of
the molten resin wavy, thus resulting in the formation of wrinkles or the like on the surface
of the surface material to spoil the appearance of the molding.Further, in a horizontal injection molding machine there is a further problem in
addition to the above problems. In the horizontal injection molding machine the injection
molding is carried out by holding the die cavity vertical. Therefore, with the die held open 
to a large extent the charged molten resin is deviated due
to the gravity, so that the thickness
