<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of imaging systems. More
particularly, the present invention provides an apparatus for
routing and flexing coolant hoses and an electrical cable to a laser
system mounted on a movable optical carriage in an imaging system
without introducing mechanical disturbances to the optical carriage.In many imaging systems, such as imagesetters or platesetters,
an optical carriage is used to displace a laser system or other
imaging source in a slow scan direction along an internal drum to
expose a supply of media supported on the drum.The specific type of laser system employed by an imaging system
depends in part on the exposure requirements of the media. For
example, when using aluminum plates having a light sensitive surface
emulsion, a lower power laser system, such as a doubled frequency Nd
(neodymium):YAG (yttruim, aluminum, garnet) laser, may be used.
However, when using thermal plates, a higher power laser system is
generally required. Unfortunately, such higher power laser systems
commonly require a complex cooling system wherein a liquid or
gaseous coolant is cycled through the laser system to prevent the
laser system from overheating. Additionally, an additional source
of power is often required due to the increased power consumption of
many high power laser systems.To ensure quality and accuracy during imaging, mechanical
disturbances to the optical carriage must be minimized to avoid the
generation of artifacts in the exposed images. Then a cooling
system is necessary, the coolant hoses for supplying coolant to the
laser system can adversely affect image quality by imparting
mechanical disturbances to the optical carriage as the optical
carriage is displaced along the internal drum of the imaging system.
Further, the coolant hoses may kink during displacement of the
optical carriage, causing a blockage of the coolant to the laser
system. This may result in the overheating and damage of the laser 
system. The electrical cable supplying power to the laser system
may also disturb the optical carriage during imaging.The present invention provides a hose and cable routing system
for routing and flexing coolant supply and return hoses between a
refrigeration system and the optical carriage of an imaging system,
and for routing and flexing an electrical cable between a power
source and the optical carriage, without introducing mechanical
disturbances to the optical carriage. In a first, preferred
embodiment of the present invention, the hose and cable routing
system
