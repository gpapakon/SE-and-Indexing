<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device having an interchangeable blade for holding a printing plate on a plate cylinder in a rotary printing machine and to a tool for removing said blade. A blade (115) for anchoring the edge of a printing plate on the outer circumferential surface (8) of a plate cylinder (1) enters the latter through a slot (19) and is mounted on a flattened portion (30, plate 121) of a clamping rail (28), arranged in the plate cylinder (1), with the aid of a guide (141) which receives an edge region (155) of the blade (115), stop means (140) being provided in order to hold the edge region (155) in the guide (141) to prevent any other movements than the removal movement through the slot (19), and an elastic stop (147, 148) being provided, which locks the edge region (155) by elastic engagement to prevent such a movement, but which is suitable to be actuated by means of a flat tool (166) inserted into the slot (19) in order to release the edge region (155). The blade can thus be mounted and removed through the slot without the clamping rail being taken out.
