<ABSTRACT>
Refuse 21 in a refuse container 2 is heated by a heater 16, and the 
steam generated from the refuse 21 is condensed by a condenser 8. The ambient 

temperature near the refuse container 2 is detected by a first temperature 
detector 6, and the output of the heater 16 is controlled by the output of 

the first temperature detector 6 so that the temperature near the 
refuse container 2 may be a specific temperature, and the temperature of the 

steam flowing out from the refuse container 2 into the condenser 8 is 
detected by a second temperature detector 7 at the condenser 8. When the 

temperature change of the second temperature detector 7 exceeds a specific 
value, the drying process is terminated, so that the drying end time can be 

detected accurately without allowing to scorch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refuse treating apparatus for treating
refuse, mainly domestic kitchen waste. From WO 91/16134, there is known a
garbage processing device wherein a shredding device is provided at the bottom of a
rotatably arranged tub and furthermore, comprising a heatable compressor plate. Kitchen
waste is shredded compressed and heated between the bottom of the tub and the corn plate whereupon the
compressor plate is raised and the shredded garbage is removed.Furthermore, from EP-A-165578, there is known a device for controlling the temperature of
a cut tobacco leaves drying apparatus including a cylindrical rotor having a plurality of
heating means which are arrayed in an advance direction of raw material independently of
each other. The heating means is controlled in accordance with a pre-set value in order to
provide an optimum drying temperature for tobacco.Hitherto, the refuse treating apparatus is classified into the combustion
heat method, microwave method and electric heater method, by the type of
heating source. The refuse treating apparatus of combustion heat method
employs gas fuel or liquid fuel, and the entire apparatus is large and
complicated, and involves a safety problem. The refuse treating apparatus of
microwave method is suited to drying process of moist waste because the
microwaves are selectively adsorbed in the moisture in the waste, but is
slightly inferior in safety and controllability. As compared with them, the
refuse treating apparatus of electric heater method is excellent in safety
and controllability, and is small in size, and hence the cost can be reduced.However, in the conventional refuse treating apparatus employing
electric heaters, when heating the refuse by the heater, in order to generate 
steam from the refuse, the heater surrounding temperature must be set over
100Â°C to obtain overheated steam, and when continued to heat in this state,
if drying is over, the temperature change is small (nearly same as the heater
set temperature), and it is hard to detect the drying end time. If the
drying end time is not detected accurately, drying time becomes longer, and
the heating cost is wasteful, or the refuse is scorched, which is not sanitary.It is hence a first object of the invention to detect the drying end time accurately
even by using an electric heater as heating means to keep the refuse in dry state so as not
to rot and to dry efficiently without abnormally heating the refuse.The above object is achieved by the subject matter of claim 1. As a
