<ABSTRACT>
Heat exchanger for electronic components and other electro-technical appliances, comprising a housing at least one of the faces of which is intended to be in contact with the appliance, while its inner space is traversed by a cooling fluid, characterised in that the housing is formed by two lateral covers (1) between which a stack of slotted thin flanges (20, 20') is brazed, the slots (21, 21') being profiled and oriented in such a way as to allow the cooling fluid to pass in a zig-zag between two connection pieces (3) carried by the housing.

<CLAIMS>
A heat-exchanger for electronic components and 
other electrotechnical apparatus, comprising a casing, 

at least one of the faces of which is intended to be in 
contact with the component or the apparatus, whereas 

the inner space thereof is traversed by a heat-transfer 
fluid between two connecting end pieces (3) borne by 

the casing, in which the casing is formed by two 
lateral covers (1), characterised in that between the 

two lateral covers there is soldered a stack of thin 
perforated plates (20, 20'), the perforations (21, 21') 

being profiled and oriented so as to permit the heat-transfer 
fluid to pass in a baffled path between the 

end pieces. 
An exchanger according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that each end piece (3) is integral with a flange 

(30) capable of embedding within notches (10, 22, 22') 
provided on the periphery of the plates (20, 20') and 

the covers (1). 
An exchanger according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the notches (22') of the plates (20') which are 

intended to be arranged opposite the end pieces (3) are 

made so as to open into the adjacent perforation (21') 
of said plates. 
An exchanger according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the perforations (21, 21') 

have an elongate profile oriented obliquely relative to 
the axis of the two end pieces (3), the plates (20, 

20') being turned such that the perforations of two 
adjacent plates cross each other.
