<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITE STENT WITH POLYMERIC COVERING AND BIOACTIVE COATINGField of the Invention This invention relates to a composite expandable device with a polymeric covering on the device and a bioactive coating on device and the polymeric covering, a delivery apparatus and a method.Background of the Invention Saphenous vein grafts have heretofore been utilized for bypassing occluded arterial blood vessels in the heart. Because they are vein tissue rather than arterial tissue, they have different characteristics and generally do not function well long term as arterial vessels. Saphenous bypass veins are less muscular and are generally quite flimsy and compliant. When these saphenous vein grafts become diseased with age, stenoses and obstructive deposits which are cheesy or buttery in consistency and which are very malleable are formed which cannot be treated effectively with interventional catheter procedures even when followed with a stent implant. The plaque material forming the stenosis tends to ooze through the stent and reoccludes flow passage through the stent and the saphenous vein graft. Other vascular obstructions, such as in femoral and popliteal vessels and in carotids as well as in native coronary arteries also suffer from occlusions. In many of these cases, plaque proliferates through the stents when stents are deployed in the vessels. Therefore a great need exists for a new and improved device and method to provide a lasting therapeutic relief in such situations.Summary of the InventionIn general, it is an object of the present invention to provide a composite expandable device with a substantially impervious polymeric covering thereon with a bioactive coating on the device and covering and a method for using the same which can be utilized for treating occlusions or partial occlusions in blood vessels and particularly saphenous vein grafts. In one embodiment, the polymeric covering is impervious. In another embodiment, the polymeric covering is porous.Another object of the invention is to provide a device of the above character which will provide a lasting therapeutic solution to the occurrence of plaque in stents in saphenous vein grafts. 

 Another object of the invention is to provide a device of the above character which can be used for repaving with endothelial cells the portion of the vessel being treated. In one embodiment, the coating is a cell adhesion peptide. In a related embodiment, the coating has the amino acid sequence presented as SEQ ID NO: 1. Another object of the invention is

WHAT IS CLAIMED:
1. A composite expandable device for delivery into a vessel carrying a blood comprising an expandable support frame having first and second end portions, a polymer sleeve extending over the support frame and having inner and outer surfaces, and a coating disposed on and attached to at least one of the inner and outer surfaces of the polymer sleeve for enhancing endothelial cell growth on the polymer sleeve.
2. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said polymer sleeve is porous.
3. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said polymer sleeve is impervious.
4. A device as in Claim 1 wherein both the inner and outer surfaces are coated with the coating.
5. A device as in Claim 1 wherein the first and second end portions are exposed and free of the sleeve.
6. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said expandable support frame and polymer sleeve are cylindrical.
7. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said expandable support frame and polymer sleeve are tapered.
8. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said expandable support frame is constructed to maintain its length during expansion of the frame.
9. A device as in Claim 1 , wherein said coating is prepared by treating said inner or outer surface with a gaseous plasma cleaning process utilizing radiofrequency energy to ablate said inner or outer surface and to functionalize said inner or outer surface and to produce a plasma-deposited layer having functional groups, and subjecting said plasma-deposited layer to multifunctional linkers/spacers in a wet chemical tratement to form covalent bonds between the linkers/spacers adn the functional groups of the plasma- deptosited layer to covalently bind the cell-adhesion peptides to said inner or outer surface of the substrate. 

10. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said coating is a cell adhesion peptide.
11. A device as in Claim 10 wherein said cell-adhesion peptide has the amino acid sequence presented as SEQ ID NO: 1.
12. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said expandable support frame includes a plurality of axially aligned belts and first and second end portions, each of said belts comprising a plurality of circumferentially spaced struts having first and second ends and foldable links secured to the first and second ends of the struts and interconnecting means serially interconnecting the belts and the first and second end portions to extend along an axis and permitting axial bending between the belts and the end portions while maintaining the length of the device.
13. A device as in Claim 12 wherein said interconnecting means includes at least one strut and a plurality of S-shaped links.
14. A device as in Claim 12 wherein said interconnecting means includes a single strut and first and second S-shaped links, all spaced 120Â° apart.

18. A device as in Claim 1 wherein said sleeve is provided with a fold and further including means for securing said label to said sleeve to inhibit dislodging of the sleeve from the frame during deployment of the device.
19. A delivery apparatus for an expandable device having a length and an inner diameter comprising a shaft, a balloon mounted on the shaft, said shaft having a lumen therein for inflating and deflating the balloon, said balloon being formed with proximal, distal and intermediate portions, said intermediate portion having a length to receive the 


expandable device, and radiopaque markers carried within the proximal and distal portions of the balloon and sized so that they have a diameter greater than the inner diameter of the expandable device when it is mounted on the intermediate portion of the balloon for securing the expandable device to the intermediate portion to prevent the expandable device from being dislodged during deployment by the delivery apparatus, the proximal and distal portions of the balloon being sized so that they have a size which is greater than the size of the expandable device when placed on the intermediate portion to inhibit inadvertent dislodgment of the expandable device during deployment of the expandable device with the apparatus.
20. A method for deploying a plurality of composite expandable devices comprising an expandable frame having opposite ends at proximal and distal extremities, a polymeric sleeve extending over the frame, with the use of a balloon delivery catheter having an inflatable balloon on the distal extremity thereof comprising the steps of mounting a first composite expandable device on the balloon, utilizing the balloon delivery catheter to deliver the device to the desired site in the vessel, inflating the balloon to expand the device in the vessel, deflating the balloon and removing the balloon from the vessel, utilizing a balloon delivery catheter to deliver a second composite expandable device to the site and docking the distal extremity of the additional composite expandable device in the proximal extremity of the first composite device already in place by causing the extremities to intermesh with each other, expanding the balloon to expand the second composite expandable device to expand the distal extremity within the proximal extremity of the composite expandable device already in place to complete the docking and deflating the balloon and removing the balloon delivery catheter from the vessel.
21. A method as in Claim 20 wherein the first device is a tapered device.
22. A device for delivery into a vessel carrying a blood comprising a polymer sleeve having inner and outer surfaces, and a coating disposed on and attached to at least one of the inner and outer surfaces of the polymer sleeve for enhancing endothelial cell growth on the polymer sleeve.
