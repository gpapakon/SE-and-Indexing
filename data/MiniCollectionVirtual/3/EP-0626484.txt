<ABSTRACT>
A rib (3) protruding downwards runs along the curved bottom edge of the tile (1,2), while the thickness of the top edge is less than the width of the undercut in the boss. The bottom wall (11) of the groove (7) is at a distance from the top edge equal to that between the ridge and the rear end of the undercut (6). The width (b) of the groove can be less than the depth of the undercut.

a locking peg (5) with an undercut (6), which is provided on the underside of the
panel 1, 2),
a fitting strip (4) running over the width of the panel (1, 2) on the underside in
the region of the bottom edge, and
a groove (7) in the region of the top edge (8), which groove is disposed at a
distance from the top edge (8) and is open upwards, wherein
the fitting strip (4) is disposed between the bottom edge of the panel (1, 2) and
the locking peg (5), and its position is selected so that it fits into the groove (7) of the

superimposed panel when the panel (1, 2) is laid,
characterised in that
the panel (1, 2) is constructed in the form of a plain tile and has a downwardly
projecting rib (3) at the bottom edge of the panel (1, 2), in the completely rounded edge

region,
the thickness of the edge region (9) at the top edge (8) is somewhat less than the
extent of the undercut (6) in the l
ocking peg (5),
the groove (7) has a lower wall (11) facing the bottom edge of the panel (1, 2)
and an upper wall (12) facing the top edge (8) of the panel (1, 2), and
the lower wall (11) of the groove (7) is at a distance from the top edge (8) which
corresponds to the distance of the fitting strip (4) from the rear end of the undercut (6)

in the locking peg (5).
A roof panel according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the width b of the groove (7) is
somewhat greater than the depth of the undercut (6).
A roof panel according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the height h of the rib (3)
is selected so that the front edge (10) of the rib (3) is aligned with the underside of the

undercut (6) in the locking peg (5). 
A roof panel according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a step (14)
which protrudes in relation to the upper side of each panel (1, 2) is provided in the top

edge region (9), which step is situated centrally between two panels (1, 2) and the top
edge (8) of which fits into the undercut (6).
