<ABSTRACT>
This detector comprises a peellet (1) of compressed powders, formed by a first powder of a reversible colorimetric material which is capable of changing colour in the presence of acid vapours or UF6, and by a second powder which is inert with respect to acid vapours and/or UF6 and/or fluorinated derivatives, this second powder being used as a binder for the grains of the first powder. The pellet (1) can be arranged in an adapter (3) introduced into the enclosure E to be monitored, which adapter may be coupled to an endoscopic (borescopic) tube (5) with a view to detecting the colour change of the pellet from outside the enclosure.
