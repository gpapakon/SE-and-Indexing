<ABSTRACT>
The reflectivities of the inside and outside rearview 
mirrors (2,1) of a car are made different to improve the 

driver's unbalanced rearview sight. For this, for instance, 
a liquid-phase ECD (electrochromic device) is used for the 

inside rearview mirror (2), and a solid-state ECD for the 
outside rearview mirror (1) so that appropriate different 

reflectivities of the two mirrors can be obtained even if they 
are driven under the same operation conditions. 
 
In case of use of the same-type ECD for both the inside and 
outside rearview mirrors, the driving voltage for the outside 

rearview mirror (1) is made lower than that for inside 
rearview mirror (2) to make the latter's reflectivity smaller 

than the former's. For this purpose, transforming circuits 
(81,80) and terminal voltage sensing and controlling circuits 

(21,20) are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a mirror system in which the 
automobile inside and outside rearview mirrors differ in 
reflectivity, and more particularly to an anti-glare rearview 
mirror system comprising an inside rearview mirror and an 
outside rearview mirror, wherein the inside rearview mirror 
is smaller in reflectivity than the outside rearview mirror. 
In this context, there is no difference whether there is one 
or are more inside rearview mirrors, and whether there is one 
or are more outside rearview mirrors. During night drives, the drivers sometimes see the inside 
rearview mirror (hereinafter referred to as "IM") and the 
outside rearview mirror ("OM") of their cars embarassingly 
glare-reflecting the light from the following cars. To prevent 
this, anti-glare mirror systems have been invented. These anti-glare mirror systems use electrochromic devices 
(hereinafter referred to as "ECD"), liquid crystal devices 
("LCD"), etc., known e.g. from SAE Technical Paper Series, 
870636, Electrochromic Automotive Day/Night Mirrors, by N. R. 
Lynam, Detroit 1987; and from EP-A-151286, respectively. ECD has the property of taking a colored or bleached state  
 
by making a reversible reaction to the polarity of the current 
applied to it. Utilizing these properties, ECD is colored when 
it is desired to reduce the mirror reflectivity and bleached 
to increase the reflectivity. LCD has the property of changing the orientation of its 
liquid crystal molecules according to the electric field 
applied to it. Upon the incidence of light into the liquid 
crystal with such molecular orientation, the light is 
polarized and makes complex refraction. Accordingly, the 
reflectivity can be controlled by controlling the orientation 
of the liquid crystal. But LCD is more difficult to handle and more expensive than 
ECD, so that ECD is more frequently used for the anti-glare 
mirror systems. There are liquid-phase ECD and solid-state ECD made from 
different materials. Comparing them, while the liquid-phase 
ECD can easier achieve a low reflectivity and can provide for 
a less expensive anti-glare mirror system, it has the 
disadvantages that it is slower in the coloring reaction 
velocity than solid-state ECD, chemically unstable, hard to 
be applied to the mirrors with a curvature, etc. The basic construction of the liquid-phase ECD is that a 
liquid-phase EC layer is sandwiched between two sheets of 
transparent substrates, and the opposite side of the surface 
of one of the substrates contacting the
