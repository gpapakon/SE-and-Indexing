<ABSTRACT>
A method for distinguishing between functionally comparable exogenous and endogenous enzymes in substrates is characterised in that antibodies directed at determinant sites on the exogenous and/or endogenous enzyme, by which the exogenous and endogenous enzymes are distinguished from one another, are produced and used for qualitative and/or quantitative determination of the endogenous and/or exogenous enzyme. The method is suitable for investigating the enzyme added exogenously to a substrate and for continuous monitoring of the enzyme activity during a process step in the human or animal food industry and other chemical or biotechnological branches of industry.
