<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for producing a moulded part by mixing a fibrous material based on synthetic fibres with an adhesive (binder) and maintaining the mixture in a mould under pressure until the adhesive has set. The fibrous material used is exclusively a finely fibrous material comprising fibres having a linear density (titre) of from 1 to 10 dtex and the adhesive used is a single-component adhesive. The amount of adhesive is chosen in such a way that the adhesive content of the ready-moulded part will be less than 10%, preferably 3 to 5%. Owing to its simplicity of construction from only one fibre component and its low adhesive content, the moulded article is suitable for renewed recycling. Preferred use is as acoustic and thermal insulant in the fitting out of buildings.
