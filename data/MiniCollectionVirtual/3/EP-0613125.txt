<ABSTRACT>
An optical pickup device capable of maintaining a 
sufficient amount of laser beam light when recording 

information on an optical disc and stabilizing the light 
emission of the semiconductor laser when reproducing 

information. Each optical component constituting an 
optical system for an optical pickup device used for both 

information recording and reproducing is formed with an 
antireflection film whose spectral reflectance changes in 

accordance with the wavelength of an incident light. 
And, in a preferable embodiment, the antireflection 
film, which has a high spectral reflectance at a shorter 

wavelength λ (L) in the whole range of light emission 
wavelengths covered by the semiconductor laser light 

source and a low spectral reflectance at a longer 
wavelength λ (H), is formed on the incident surface or 

outgoing surface of at least one optical transparent 
element (for example, 5). 
As a result, in recording information on an optical 
disc wherein a laser beam is emitted at a high output 

power and at a wavelength λ shifted to a longer peak 
wavelength λ (H), the transmission coefficient of a laser 

beam becomes high. Furthermore, in reproducing 
information wherein a laser beam is emitted at a low 

output power and at a wavelength λ shifted to a shorter  
 

peak wavelength λ (L), the transmission coefficient of a 
laser beam becomes low, reducing the amount of light 

returned to the emission surface of the semiconductor 
laser.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical pickup
device for an optical disc capable of information
recording and reproducing, and more particularly to an
optical pickup device suitable for stable light emission
of a semiconductor laser in reproducing information
recorded on an optical disc.Fig.5 shows a total spectral reflectance
characteristic of antireflection thin films used in an
optical system of a conventional optical pickup device.In an optical pickup device having a function of
recording information on an optical disc and reproducing
recorded information, an optical system providing an
optical path for a laser beam includes, as shown in
Fig.3, a semiconductor laser 1 for emitting a laser beam,
a collimator lens 2, a quarter wavelength plate 3, a
diffraction grating 4, two beam shaping prisms 5, a beam
splitter 6, a mirror 7, and an objective lens 8 disposed
in this order. A laser beam passed through this optical
system is applied to an optical disc 9 in the form of a 
laser beam spot.In an optical pickup device dedicated to only
intonation reproduction, an optical system providing an
optical path for a laser beam includes, as shown in
Fig.4, a semiconductor laser 1, a collimator lens 2, a
diffraction grating 4, a beam splitter 6, a mirror 7, and
an objective lens 8 disposed in this order. A laser beam
passed through this optical system is applied to an
optical disc 9 in the form of a laser beam spot.As compared with the optical system for an optical
pickup device dedicated only to information reproduction,
because the optical system for both information recording
and reproducing requires a higher output power when
recording information than when reproducing information,
the structure of this optical system becomes more
complicate in order to effectively use the light emission
amount of the semiconductor laser 1.In order to efficiently guide a laser beam to the
optical disc 9 when recording information, antireflection
thin films have been generally formed at laser beam
transmission surfaces of each optical component of the
optical pickup device for both information recording and
reproducing. That is to say, the antireflection thin
films are formed at transmission surfaces of the
collimator lens 2, quarter wavelength plate 3, 
diffraction grating 4, two beam shaping prisms 5, beam
splitter 6, mirror 7, and lens 8.EP 0 497 291, against which claims 1 and 2 are delimited,
discloses an optical disk memory apparatus that has a
compound prism whose entry and exit faces are
preferably formed with an
