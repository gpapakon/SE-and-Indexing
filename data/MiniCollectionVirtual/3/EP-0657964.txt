<ABSTRACT>
A connector includes a retainer that can be 
provisionally retained by a connector positioning device. 

Each retainer is integrally molded on a connector housing 
through hinge pieces, and can be attached to the connector 

housing by fitting a guide slot of each of the retaining 
pieces on a guide projection. Therefore, the retainer can 

be attached by a pusher that pushes the retainer in a 
direction perpendicular to the connector housing. At this 

time, for attaching the retainer to a provisionally-retained 
position, there is provided a guide for holding 

the retainer in such a posture that the retainer can be 
attached in the provisionally-retained position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector having a retainer 
integrally molded on a connector housing through flexible 
hinge pieces, and also to a connector positioning device 
for placing flexible hinge pieces of the retainer in a provisional 
retaining position relative to the connector housing. GB-A-2 260 866 discloses a connector, of the kind the present invention starts from in claim 1. This connector consists of a 
housing with terminal accommodating chambers formed therein 
and a rear holder integrally joined to the housing by hinge 
straps. The housing has openings extending to the terminal 
accommodating chambers, and the rear holder includes terminal 
locking projections insertable into the terminal accommodating 
chambers through the openings. The rear holder is 
fittable on the housing in two steps of a preliminary engaged 
state and a fully engaged state. In the preliminary engaged 
state the terminal locking projections are located 
out of movement paths of terminal lugs in the terminal accommodating 
chambers and, in the fully engaged state the 
terminal locking projections are located in the movement 
paths to prevent the terminal lugs from slipping off from 
the rear of the terminal accomodating chambers. US-A-4,718,159 describes an apparatus for terminating 
wires to terminals in a connector housing, for shearing 
from the housing a cover which is hinged thereto and for 
placing the cover on the housing to cover the connections. 
The connector housing is conveyed by means of a first shuttle 
to a cover shearing station at which the cover is sheared 
from the housing and is driven into a second shuttle. 
The first shuttle is then moved to a terminating station at 
which wires are terminated to the terminals by tooling after 
which the second shuttle is moved to the terminating 
station and the tooling is operated to drive the severed 
cover from the second shuttle onto the connector housing. 
This document is of interest with respect to claim 9.  
 A method and apparatus for closing and bonding initially 
open clam-shell housings about articles such as 
electrical terminals or the like is known from US-A-3,955,275. 
The housings are initially in strip form, a 
plurality of the initially open clam-shell housings being 
interconnected to each other by hinge mebers which extend 
outwardly from either the ends or the sides of opposed housing 
parts. A leading housing of the strip is initially 
disposed at an assembly station and an article is conveyed 
laterally into the housing. Subsequently

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising an integral retainer that is 
molded on a connector housing (1) through flexible hinge 

pieces (3), wherein: 

said connector housing (1) comprises tubular shaped 
terminal receiving chambers (11) for receiving metal terminals 

that are each connected to an end of a wire, and retainer 
insertion openings (13) open to one side of said 

terminal receiving chambers (11), respectively; 
said retainer includes a retainer body (20) having 
terminal lock portions (22a) each insertable into respective 

ones of said retainer insertion openings (13) to 
retain and engage a side of each said inserted metal terminal; 

and 
said retainer is attachable in a provisionally-retained 
position where said terminal lock portions (22a) 

formed on said retainer body (20) being disengaged from 
said metal terminals, and said retainer also being attachable 

in a completely-retained position where said terminal 
lock portions (22a) engage with respective said metal terminals, 
 
   characterized in that 


retaining pieces (21) are formed respectively at opposite 
ends of said retainer body (20) in such a manner that 

said retainer has a gate-shape; and 
each of said retaining pieces (21) comprises a guide 
slot (23) for engagement with a respective guide projection 

(14a) at said connector housing (1) in said provisionally-retained 
position and for engagement with an adjacent lock 

projection (14b) in said completely-retained position, 
wherein 
said retaining pieces (21) being attached respectively 
to opposite sides of said connector housing (1) such that 

said retainer being slidingly movable along an outer surface  
 

of said connector housing (1) from said provisionally-retained 
position into said completely-retained position.
