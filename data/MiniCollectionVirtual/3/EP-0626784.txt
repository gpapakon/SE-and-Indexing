<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photo-electric
conversion apparatus e.g. used in an AE (Auto-Exposure)
sensor or AF (Auto-Focus) sensor of a copying machine, a
facsimile machine, a video camera recorder and a camera.As electronics technology has developed recently, high
image resolution and high image quality have rapidly been
realised in the field of a solid state image pick-up device
used as a photo-electric conversion apparatus. An output
of the solid state image pick-up device is rarely used as
it is but it is processed in several stages before it is
formed into a TV signal.Accordingly, when the number of pixels is increased
to attain high resolution, a huge volume of operation and
processing are required in the signal processing and the
high image quality may be restricted by the signal
processing.GB-A-2185654 discloses an array of photosensors for
detecting a scanned laser beam reflected from an original.
Because of the scanning action, the amount of light
integrated by the photosensors for a uniform original 
varies according to the position of each sensor along the
array. Several arrangements are proposed for compensating
the output signals from the photosensors for this effect.
In one case the array is divided into sets of consecutive
sensor elements, each set having a respective signal
amplifier, or alternatively a separate signal amplifier is
provided for each photosensor. The gains of the different
amplifiers are set at different levels, so as to provide
the necessary compensation.WO-A-91/04633 discloses an array image sensor having
an array of pixels laid out in rows and columns, and each
vertical column of pixels is connected to a common bit line
conductor which is connected to a respective analog switch
sense amplifier. In one illustrated circuit for the sense
amplifier, its gain is controlled by the value of a
feedback capacitor. It is proposed that within the column
sense amplifier automatic gain control may be used to
improve black image quality.According to the present invention there is provided
photoelectric conversion apparatus as set out in claim 1.
Optional features are set out in the remaining claims.A solid state image pick-up device embodying the
invention produces signals multiplied by coefficients in
order to 
build a signal processing function into the solid state
image pick-up device.An embodiment of the present invention provides a
photo-electric conversion apparatus comprising a plurality
of photo-electric conversion elements and an
externally gain controllable
