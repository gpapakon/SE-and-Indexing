<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to circular
knitting machines and more particularly to such
circular knitting machines in which the stitch length
in the knit fabric is adjusted responsive to changing
conditions.In circular knit fabrics, it is highly
desirable to have the stitch loops as uniform as
possible. Various changeable conditions substantially
affect the stitch loops being formed on a circular
knitting machine. Examples of such changeable
conditions are the tension in the yarns being fed to
the knitting instrumentalities and the spacing between
the upper end of the needle cylinder and the sinker cap
in a single knit circular knitting machine or the dial
in a double-knit circular knitting machine.Generally, the stitch loops being formed by a
circular knitting machine are adjusted by a movable
support for the stitch cams which is moved by an
eccentric screw or rotating cam (see GB-A-2 193 230). Once the position of
the stitch cam support is adjusted, the screw or cam is
stopped by a stop means. With such adjustment devices,
the movement of the screw or rotation of the cam is
conducted artificially by a mechanic or fixer and is
not conducted automatically responsive to changing
conditions.Recently, it has been proposed to adjust the
stitch cam support by means of a rotary actuator. 
However, the rotary actuator is too large for a
knitting machine having multiple yarn feeding stations.Further, it has been previously proposed in
United States Patent No. 5,018,370 to provide a central
stitch length controlling apparatus for a circular
knitting in which an elevating means vertically adjusts
the stitch cam support ring to vary the length of the
stitch loops being formed. However, the elevating
means is manually operated and is not responsive to
changing conditions.In all of these prior stitch adjustments, the
stitch cam is stopped at a certain position when the
stitch adjustment is made. Therefore, variations in
the tension in the yarns being fed induced by the
inertia of the components of the knitting section and
their thermal expansion and contraction are not
considered. Consequently, knitting flaws tend to
occur, resulting in less fabric quality than is desired
and extremely poor productivity.One prior proposal contained in Japanese
Patent Laid Open No. 195386 of 1993 does take
dimensional variation of the knitting machine
components caused by thermal expansion or contraction
into account. This proposal attempts to compensate
automatically for variations in the gap between the
upper end of the needle
