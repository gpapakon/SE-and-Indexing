<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the sequential
degradation of proteins and peptides from the
N-terminus. In particular, the invention permits
N-terminal degradation of protein and peptide samples
in the picomole to subpicomole range. The amino acid
derivatives are rapidly detectable at high
sensitivity by electrospray mass spectrometry.Proteins have a central role in all biological
processes including the development and treatment at
human disease. Recent advances make it possible to
isolate proteins of biological interest which are
present in tissues in subpicomole quantities. Study
of the structure function aspects of these proteins
requires sequence information prerequisite to cloning
and expression thereof. There is a consequential
need for improved methods to sequence proteins and
protein fragments at sample levels several orders of
magnitude smaller than is now possible.Currently, protein sequence analysis is primarily
accomplished with the use of an automated sequencer
using chemistry developed by Edman over 40 years ago
(Edman, 1950) 
(Figure 1). Since that time
improvement in the instrumentation has resulted in 
the ability to sequence smaller and smaller sample
quantities (mmole to pmol), although the original
chemistry has remained essentially unchanged.
Current automated instrumentation permits 10-20
cycles of sequence determination of 10-50 pmol of
sample (Simpson et al., 1989).The major limitation of Edman chemistry is the
approximately one picomole practical detection limit
of the PTH amino acids. The current method involves
separation of the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino
acids by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) followed by UV detection.Various proposals to increase the sensitivity of
the PTH's by use of radiolabeled, chromophoric, or
fluorescent isothiocyanate reagents have been
described. 4-(N,N'-Dimethylamino)azobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate
(DABITC), a highly chromophoric
reagent, was introduced by Chang (Chang et al.,
1976). Fluorescent reagents, such as fluorescein
isothiocyanate (Maeda and Kawauchi, 1968; Muramoto et
al. 1984), and dansyl-containing isothiocyanates
(Hirano and Wittmann-Liebold, 1986; Hirano and
Wittmann-Liebold, 1987; Jin et al., 1986; Jin et al.,
1989; Salnikow et al. 1987) have also been evaluated
as sensitivity enhancing reagents. Synthetic amino
acid analogues prepared using these reagents have
shown subpicomole sensitivity by HPLC analysis.
However, the use of these reagents in automated
sequencing has not surpassed the sensitivity of the
standard Edman

<CLAIMS>
A process for the sequential degradation of a
protein or peptide from the N-terminus in which the N-terminal

amino acid of a peptide is derivatized with an
isothiocyanate and the derivatized N-terminal amino acid

is cleaved to provide said derivatized N-terminal amino
acid and a residual peptide, characterised in that the N-terminal

amino acid of said protein or peptide is
derivatized with an isochiocyanate which has a tertiary

amino function of the formula


in which R
1
 and R
2
 are independently the same or different
alkyl groups having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or phenyl groups

or CH
2
 groups in heterocyclic ring and n is 1 to 15.
A process as claimed in claim 1 in which
said N-terminal amino acid of said protein or peptide

is derivatized with dimethylaminopropyl isothiocynate. 
A process for the sequential degradation of a
protein or peptide from the N-terminus which comprises


(i) providing a deprotonated sample of a
protein or peptide to be sequentially degraded;
(ii) derivatizing the n-terminal amino acid
of said protein or peptide with

dimethylaminopropyl isothiocyanate;
(iii) cleaving said derivatized n-terminal
amino acid from said protein or peptide to

provide a separated dimethylaminopropyl
thiohydantoin amino acid and a residual peptide

having one less amino acid residue than said
sample; and
(iv) identifying said separated
dimethylaminopropyl amino acid by mass

spectrometry.
A process for the rapid sequential n-terminal
degradation of a protein or a peptide and analysis of

the degradation products which comprises

providing an automated n-terminal sequencer
connected on line to an electrospray mass

spectrometer;
subjecting a deprotonated sample of a
protein or peptide to derivatization and cleavage

by said automated n-terminal sequencer;
said derivatization being accomplished
by reaction of said sample with

dimethylamino propyl isothiocyanate;
said cleavage providing a separated
dimethylaminopropyl thiohydantoin cleavage

product;
introducing said cleavage product directly
into said electron spray mass spectrometer to

identify said cleavage product.
