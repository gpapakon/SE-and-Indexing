<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a subscriber
transmission system for providing telephone service to
subscribers located remotely from an exchange office, and
more particularly to a subscriber transmission system
wherein power supplied to a transmitter of the subscriber
side can be reduced when the rate of telephone use is
low.A subscriber transmission system is one which
concentrates a plurality of subscriber terminals and
connects them to an exchange office via optical
transmission lines, etc. It is used for the purpose of
reduction of transmission loss and construction cost of
subscriber lines so that when subscriber terminals are
located in places remote from the exchange office, such
subscribers can be served by the switching system.In a thinly populated area, because of the low
telephone use rate, it is economically disadvantageous to
always supply full electric power to the transmitters of
the subscriber side. So, in this case, it is desirable
to supply electric power of an amount which corresponds
to a specific number of subscribers, so that the amount
of consumed electric power may be reduced.In a conventional subscriber transmission
system, since all of the subscriber transmitter-receivers
in the transmission apparatus of the subscriber side are
connected to subscribers, all the device are always
supplied with electric power.However, in the subscriber transmission system,
the telephone use rate of the subscribers connected to
the subscriber side transmission apparatus is often low.
Therefore, there is a problem that supplying all the 
subscriber transmitter-receivers with electric power results
in a waste of electric power supplied in connection with the
rate of device use.From EP-A-0 483 458 there is known a power reduction
technique for a time slot interchanger in the subscriber
interface, where the read/writer operations of a part of a
large static RAM are disabled according to data output from a
power control RAM to reduce the electric power supplied to
the large static RAM.The present invention intends to solve such problems of the
prior art as mentioned above and its object is to reduce the
quantity of electric power consumption by supplying
subscriber transmitter-receivers with only the amount of
electric power which corresponds to a specific number of
subscribers.According to the present invention:
(1) A transmission apparatus is provided on the subscriber
side in a subscriber transmission system wherein a subscriber
side transmission apparatus servicing a plurality of
subscribers and
