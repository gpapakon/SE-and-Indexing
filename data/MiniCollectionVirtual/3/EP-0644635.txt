<ABSTRACT>
A driving method of the present invention drives 
a semiconductor laser which is provided with at least 

first and second electrodes through each of which 
current is injected into the semiconductor laser. 

Varying current is injected through the first 
electrode when the frequency of the varying current 

is in a high frequency band. Varying current is 
injected through the first electrode while 

phase-shifted current, whose phase is shifted 
relative to the varying current, is injected 

through the second electrode, when the frequency 
of the varyin
g current is in a low frequency 
band which is lower than the frequency of the 

high frequency band. Feedback-control 
may be performed for controlling a ratio between 

amplitudes of the modulation current and the 
phase-shifted current based on a light output from 

the semiconductor laser. The varying current includes 
at least modulation current modulated according 

to a predetermined signal or negative feedback 
current produced by an electric signal obtained 

by detecting fluctuation of oscillation wavelength 
of a light output from the semiconductor laser. 

Thus, an optical signal radiated from the laser can 
be desirably stabilized over a wide frequency band 

range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving method
and a driving apparatus for a semiconductor laser, and
an optical communication method and system using
the driving method and apparatus. The present invention
also relates to a modulation method for a semiconductor
laser that is used as a light source for optical
communications, in which a modulation signal for driving
the laser is caused to be in-phase with an optically
modulated signal radiated from the laser over a wide
modulation frequency band. The present invention
further relates to a driving method for a semiconductor
laser for stabilizing and narrowing the
spectral line-width of an oscillation wavelength of
the laser even if the frequency of fluctuation of the
spectrum of oscillation wavelength or optical frequency
is low. Within the spectral line-width, the oscillation
wavelength of the laser fluctuates with time.Conventionally, a distributed feedback laser (DFB
laser), that radiates in a single longitudinal or axial 
mode, has been developed as a light source for optical
communications, for example.In a direct optical intensity or amplitude
modulation system, which is presently put into practice
using the above laser (also referred to as LD
hereinafter), the amplitude of a modulation current
required for driving LD needs to be set around
several tens of mA. In addition, the bias current
point of LD needs to be close to its threshold.
As a result, the resonance frequency due to
relaxation vibration is low, and hence such LD
is unsuitable for high-frequency modulation of
more than several Gbps. The phenomenon of such
resonance is observed in the high-frequency
modulation of LD. Furthermore, the fluctuation of the
oscillation wavelength during the modulation of LD is
large, leading to the problem of wavelength dispersion
of signals during long-distance transmissions through
an optical fiber and the problem of crosstalk between
channels in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
communications.On the other hand, in a direct frequency modulation
system, which utilizes modulation current injection into
LD, the amplitude of modulation current is small, e.g. about
several mA, and the bias current point of LD is above
its threshold. Thus, LD is constantly modulated while
oscillating. Therefore, a direct frequency 
modulation system is capable of modulation in a wide
bandwidth, and its oscillation wavelength fluctuation is
small. Thus, the direct frequency modulation system is
promising for use in long-distance transmissions and
wavelength division
