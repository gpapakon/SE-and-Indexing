<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer printing receiver sheet for use in security laminates, comprises a substrate supporting a receiver coat of a dye-receptive composition on one side and a backcoat on the other, wherein the backcoat comprises a thermoplastic polymer having a Tg less than 130  DEG C, and dispersed therein a particulate solid material in amount 1-24 % by weight of the thermoplastic polymer and an average particle size of 0.3-10  mu m. The security laminates are prepared after printing the receiver with an image, by bonding a first cover sheet of plastics material to the printed receiver coat so as to overlie the image, and a second cover sheet of plastics material can be bonded to the present backcoat more readily than to a highly crosslinked backcoat, using common adhesives. For greater security, thicker than normal backcoats are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to receiver sheets for 
dye-diffusion thermal transfer printing, and in 
particular to receiver sheets for use in security 
laminates in which the receiver sheet after printing is 
laminated to protective cover sheets on both its 
printed side and its reverse side. The invention also 
relates to security laminates comprising such printed 
receiver sheets. Security laminates are presently based on 
various types of information-carrying sheets laminated 
to cover sheets. These typically have at least one 
side carrying pictorial information in the form of a 
normal optical photograph, including typed script 
and/or signatures as appropriate. This is bonded to a 
cover sheet on each side. These cover sheets normally 
overlap to bond to each other and form a pouch, at 
least during manufacture, but in the final product the 
information carrying sheet may have raw unprotected 
edges, eg when cards or tags are stamped or cut out of 
a larger area. An alternative to optical photography as a 
means of producing pictorial representations of 
persons, signatures, graphics and other such form of 
information, is thermal transfer printing. However, 
while this technology can provide some advantages, 
particularly in its versatility, it can also produce 
difficulties in lamination. Thermal transfer printing is a generic term for 
processes in which one or more thermally transferable 
dyes are caused to transfer from a dyesheet to a 
receiver in response to thermal stimuli. Using a 
dyesheet comprising a thin substrate supporting a 
dyecoat containing one or more such dyes uniformly 
spread over an entire printing area of the dyesheet,  
 
printing can be effected by heating selected discrete 
areas of the dyesheet while the dyecoat is pressed 
against a receiver sheet, thereby causing dye to 
transfer to corresponding areas of that receiver. The 
shape of the pattern transferred is determined by the 
number and location of the discrete areas which are 
subjected to heating. Full colour prints can be 
produced by printing with different coloured dyecoats 
sequentially in like manner, and the different coloured 
dyecoats are usually provided as discrete uniform 
print-size areas in a repeated sequence along the same 
dyesheet. High resolution photograph-like prints can be 
produced by these techniques using appropriate printing 
equipment, such as a programmable thermal print head or 
laser transfer printer, controlled by electronic image 
signals derived from a video, computer, electronic 
still
