<ABSTRACT>
In order to offer a printer capable of high throughput printing even when printing of the same or
only partially different data is repeated, the printing apparatus of present invention equipped

with a storage means for storing print image data based on print data received from a host
device in a designated position and printing means that performs printing on a recording

medium based on the print image data stored in the storage means in accordance with control
data received from said host device, comprises first erasure means for selectively deleting print

image data that have been printed in accordance with control data received from the host
device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a printing apparatus equipped with a storage means for storing
print image data generated based on print data received from a host device, and more specifically
it is related to a printing apparatus adapted to print the same or similar print image data stored in
said storage means a plurality of times. Therefore, the present invention is particularly suited to
printing apparatus for POS or ECR use that perform printing on transaction slips.These so-called terminal printers develop print data received from the host device, a personal
computer for example, as character codes or graphic language data into print image data in one-page
or one-row units, for example, and store these data in an image buffer, which is the storage
means. The development of print image data from character codes is normally done by means of
a character generator, and the development of graphic data is performed by using certain drawing
algorithms. The position in the image buffer at which the print image data are stored is
determined by a print position command sent from the host device prior to the print data. This
development process takes substantial amount of time when the amount of data is large. Upon
completion of the development the obtained print image data are normally printed in accordance
with control data, e.g., a print (execution) command, from the host computer.In the conventional printers, print image data are automatically erased from the image buffer once
they have been printed, i.e., a print command has been executed. "Erased" means the image
buffer is cleared rather than having print image data overwritten by new print image data. The
reason for clearing the image buffer rather than simply overwriting print image data with new
print image data is that overwriting does not necessarily result in all of the previous print image
data being overwritten. That is, when new print data correspond to only part of the image buffer,
previous print image data still exist in the remaining part of the buffer, resulting in new print
image data being superposed on previous ones.In this kind of conventional printer, there was a problem when the user wanted to repeatedly print
the same or only partially different data on a plurality of recording medium sheets, or when the
user wanted to repeat printing the same or only partially different rows on the same recording
medium sheet. That is, since conventional printers erased print image data from the image buffer
after printing them, all of the

A printing apparatus adapted to receive print data and control data from a host device
(1),

the printing apparatus
comprising:


storage means (7, 7a, 23) for storing print image data corresponding to print data
received from the host device,
printing means (8, 21, 25) for printing said print image data on a recording medium in
response to a print command (11a, 11d) among said control data,
first erasure means (6, 21) for erasing the print image data in said storage means in
response to said printing means having printed these data, and
erasure control means (21) responsive to predetermined control data (11a, 11d) among
the control data received from the host device (1) for switching between a first mode of operation

in which said first erasure means (6, 21) is enabled and a second mode of operation in which said
first erasure means (6, 21) is disabled,

   
characterized in that
 said printing means is adapted to print said print image data on the
recording medium in response to each of two alternative print commands among said control data and said erasure control

means (21) is adapted to switch to said first mode of operation in response to a first one of said
two print commands and to said second mode of operation in response to the second one of said

two print commands.
The apparatus according to Claim 1, further 
characterized by
:

area designation means (9) responsive to a predetermined first control command among
the control data (11e) received from said host device (1) for designating part or all of said storage

means (7), and
second erasure means (10) responsive to a predetermined second control command
among the control data (11f) received from said host device (1) for erasing only the print image

data stored in the part or all of said storage means designated by said area designation means (9).
A method of controlling a printing apparatus adapted to receive print data and control
data from a host device (1), comprising the steps of:


(a) storing print image data corresponding to print data received from the host device in
storage means (7, 7a, 23),
(b) printing said print image data on a recording medium in response to a print command
among said control data received from the host device,
(c) switching the printing apparatus to a first or a second one of two predetermined
modes of operation in response to predetermined control data (11a, 11d) among the control data

received from the host device (1), and
(d) erasing the print image data in said storage means after they have been printed in
step (b) if and only if the printing apparatus is in the first one of said two modes of operation,
