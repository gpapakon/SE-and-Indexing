<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dynamically vulcanized blends having improved heat 
aging characteristics. Such blends can be used as toughened plastics or thermoplastic 
elastomers. A thermoplastic elastomer is generally defined as a polymer or blend of 
polymers that can be processed and recycled in the same way as a conventional thermoplastic 
material, yet has properties and performance similar to that of vulcanized rubber at service 
temperatures. Blends or alloys of plastic and elastomeric rubber have become increasingly 
important in the production of high performance thermoplastic elastomers, particularly for 
the replacement of thermoset rubber in various applications. Polymer blends which have a combination of both thermoplastic and elastic properties 
are generally obtained by combining a thermoplastic resin with an elastomeric composition in 
a way such that the elastomer is intimately and uniformly dispersed as a discrete particulate 
phase within a continuous phase of the thermoplastic. Early work with vulcanized 
compositions is found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,037,954 which discloses static vulcanization as well 
as the technique of dynamic vulcanization wherein a vulcanizable elastomer is dispersed into 
a resinous thermoplastic polymer and the elastomer is cured while continuously mixing and 
shearing the polymer blend. The resulting composition is a micro-gel dispersion of cured 
elastomer in an uncured matrix of thermoplastic polymer In U.S. Pat. No. 4,141,863 a thermoplastic elastomer comprising a blend of rubber  
 
and a thermoplastic, high molecular weight polyester is described. The rubber component is 
a crosslinked homopolymer or copolymer of 1,3 butadiene. The use of the crosslinked 
rubber is said to improve the strength and toughness of the compositions. Published European Patent Application No. 337,976 discloses thermoplastic elastomer 
compositions prepared from a blend of polyester resin and a covalently-crosslinked acrylate 
rubber. These thermoplastic elastomers are prepared by dynamic vulcanization and exhibit 
high temperature dimensional stability and low oil swell. U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,426 teaches a combination of a thermoplastic resin such as a 
polyester with a specific copolymer rubber derived from alkyl acrylate, conjugated diene and 
another ethylenically unsaturated compound. The copolymer rubber is hydrogenated, then 
blended with the thermoplastic resin to provide a composition having superior low 
temperature performance, heat, ozone and oil resistance, mechanical
