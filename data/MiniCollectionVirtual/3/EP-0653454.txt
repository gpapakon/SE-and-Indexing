<ABSTRACT>
A resinous film at least partially formulated from a 
recy
cled resin and containing a vapor phase corrosion 
inhibitor. One embodiment of the invention is a single 

layer film which is formulated from three components. The 
first component is a recycled resin such as polyethylene, 

the second component is a fresh resin identical to the 
first, and the third component is a vapor phase anti-corrosion 

agent. Multi-layer films are also included. The 
films emit the anti-corrosion agent over a period of time 

to thereby protect items encased by the film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to plastic film
products, and in particular to a plastic film containing an
anti-corrosion agent and wherein at least a portion of the
film is formulated with recycled plastic.Recycled resins represent an important and significant
source for material useable in the production of plastic
products. ASTM standard D 5033-90 defines the various
types of recycled plastics. Non-limiting examples of such
plastics are post consumer recycled plastics which are
defined in the ASTM standard as "products generated by a
business or consumer that have served their intended end
uses, and that have been separated or diverted from solid
waste for the purpose of collection, recycling, and
disposition." After use, discarded recyclable items are
processed to yield a resin usually supplied in pellet form
which can be used again in the formulation of another
product. Such reuse is beneficial to the environment and
acts to conserve natural resources.Because the history of recycled resin is unknown,
however, it can be possible that this resin will have
corrosive properties which can cause an untoward effect
upon, for example, an article which is susceptible to
corrosion and which is subsequently packaged within a film
containing a recycled component. Commonly assigned U.S.
patent number 5,139,700, discloses
films having incorporated therein corrosion inhibitors for
the protection of items to be packaged by those films.
However, because the resins used for the described films
are fresh, no need existed to address a problem of
corrosion causation by the resin itself. A need is thus
evident for incorporating anti-corrosion agents with
recycled resins to thereby counteract possible corrosive
agents therein while promoting effective utilization of a
recycled commodity. It is therefore a primary object of the present
invention to provide a resin film containing a vapor phase
anti-corrosion agent and wherein at least one component
thereof is a recycled plastic.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a resin film formulated at least in part from a recycled
plastic and containing an effective amount of a vapor phase
anti-corrosion agent sufficient to overcome corrosive
agents within the recycled plastic and to provide corrosion
protection for items subsequently encased by the film.Yet another object of the present invention is to
provide a multi-layer laminate film wherein at least one of
the layers is formulated at least in part from recycled
plastic and wherein the film possesses vapor
