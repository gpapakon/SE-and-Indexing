<ABSTRACT>
A benzothiazolesulfonamide derivative represented by general formula (1) and having the activity of inhibiting 
protein phosphorylases such as protein kinase C and myosin light-chain kinase, a pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition 

salt thereof, a process for producing the same, a medicinal composition containing the same, and a drug 
containing the same as the active ingredient for treating or preventing asthma on the basis of the protein phosphorylase 

inhibitor activity. In formula (1) A represents lower alkylene; R¹ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R² and R³ 
represent each independently hydrogen or lower alkyl, or they are combined together to represent lower alkylene; and 

R⁴ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, amidino or phenyl-lower alkyl, wherein the phenyl group is mono- or disubstituted 
by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen or methylenedioxy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel benzothiazolesulfonamide
derivative, and a method for preparing
the same, and a pharmaceutical use thereof.In International Patent Application Publication
No. WO92/14712, there is disclosed a benzothiazolesulfonylaminoethyl
derivative, more specifically,
1-[2-(6-benzothiazolesulfonylamino)ethyl]-4-[3-(phenoxy)propyl]piperazine,
which has the ability to
relax a bronchial smooth muscle by its antihistaminic
activity. However, there is no description teaching or
suggesting that the above-mentioned benzothiazolesulfonylaminoethyl
derivative has a protein kinase inhibiting
activity.In a living body, various types of protein kinases,
such as protein kinase C, cyclic AMP-dependent
kinase, cyclic GMP-dependent kinase and myosin light
chain kinase, are present. With respect to the inhibitors
for the above protein kinases, there have been 
proposed and expected various uses, such as a drug for
circulatory organ diseases and a carcinostatic agent.
Recently, it has been strongly desired to provide a
compound having more excellent protein kinase inhibiting
activity as compared to the protein kinase inhibiting
activities of the known protein kinase inhibitors.The present inventors have made extensive and
intensive studies with a view toward developing a
compound which exhibits an excellent protein kinase
inhibiting activity. As a result, it has been found
that a specific benzothiazolesulfonamide derivative
which is represented by the formula (I) described below
has an excellent activity to inhibit protein kinase C
and myosin light chain kinase. Based on the above
finding, the present invention has been completed.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a benzothiazolesulfonamide derivative
represented by the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically
acceptable acid addition salt thereof
wherein A represents a C2-6 alkylene group
which is unsubstituted or substituted with a
C1-4 alkyl group; R1 represents a hydrogen
atom or a C1-4 alkyl group; each of R2 and R3
independently represents a hydrogen atom or a
C1-6 alkyl group, or R2 and R3 are bonded to
each other to form a C1-4 alkylene group
which is unsubstituted or substituted with a
C1-4 alkyl group; and R4 represents a hydrogen
atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, an amidino
group, or a group represented by the formula
(II)
wherein B represents a C1-6 alkylene group
which is unsubstituted or substituted with a
C1-4 alkyl group; and each of R5 and R6
independently represents a hydrogen atom, a
C1-6 alkyl group, a C1-6
