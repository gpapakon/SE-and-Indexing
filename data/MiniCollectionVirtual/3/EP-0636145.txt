<DESCRIPTION>
SYNTHETIC POLYPEPTIDES DERIVED FROM THE HIV ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN.The present invention relates to synthetic polypeptides. It particularly relates to synthetic polypeptides which emulate the three-dimensional structures and/or electrostatic surfaces and/or other physical, chemical and structural properties of specific regions of viral envelope proteins. It is of particular interest to the design of vaccines, immunologically active therapeutic agents, diagnostics and other medical or scientific agents in relation to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) known to be the causative agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) . Within the last decade AIDS has emerged as an important medical problem throughout the world and there is currently an urgent need for agents for the study, diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of infection by the HIV, the causative agent of the disease. With the availability of the amino acid sequences of proteins produced by the HIV 1 and HIV 2 viruses (see, for example, Ratner, L. et al., Nature 313. 277 (1985); Meusing, M.A. et al., Nature 313, 450 (1985); Wain- Hobson, S. et al., Cell 4_0 , 9 (1985)), it has been possible to devise synthetic polypeptides which emulate the antigenic properties of the viral envelope proteins.An object of the present invention is the development of synthetic polypeptides which can elicit the production of antibodies to the HIV virus, and most preferably neutralising antibodies, that is, antibodies which prevent infection by and/or limit the spread of the HIV virus by passive or active immunisation. Passive immunisation with such antibodies may constitute an effective means of treatment of AIDS patients thus controlling the spread of the virus within and between individuals and hence slow or halt the progress of the disease.Our invention provides a synthetic polypeptide 

having at least one antigenic property of the envelope protein of at least one strain of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) r said polypeptide consisting substantially of an amino acid sequence of formula (I) :-X-R1-Leu-R2-Leu-Thr-Val-Trp-Gly-R*5-Lys-Y(I) wherein R1 is selected from Gln-Gln-R4—R5, Gln-R4-H~, R4-Rgr j or R.J is absent; R2 iiss aann aammiinnoo aacciidd rreessii<due selected from Gin, Lys, Glu or Arg;R- iiss aann aammiinnoo aacciidd residue selected from lie, Thr or Ala;R4 is His or Glu; 5 is Leu or Met; andX and Y may each independently be absent or independently be one or more amino acid residues. Normally, when R1 is Gln-Gln-R4-R5 and X and Y are present,
