A coffee maker with a device for heating at 
least one cup (7, 8; 23) seated on a support surface (3; 

15, 16), and a heat source (2) adapted to heat water in a 
water reservoir (1) to a temperature such that water 

vapor and/or steam is formed that is deliverable to a cup 
(7, 8; 23) resting on the support surface (3; 15, 16), 

heating the cup in the process,
characterized in that
 discharge 
ports (9, 10) are arranged such as to enable them to be 

covered by the cavity of the cups (7, 8) having their respective 
rims resting on the plates (4, 5) providing the 

support surface (3). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the water 
reservoir (1) is open, enabling water vapor and/or steam 

to rise continuously during heating from the water reservoir 
(1) through a respective discharge port (9, 10; 18) 

associated with a cup. 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the support 
surface (3; 15, 16) is inclined relative to the horizontal. 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that
 the support 
surface (3; 15, 16) is comprised of two or more plates 

(4, 5) inclined in opposite directions. 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that
 the support 
surface (3; 15, 16) has a collection device (24) for condensed 

water at its lowermost point. 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that
 the collection 
device (24) comprises one or several drain holes 

(11) and/or a channel which open into an additional collection 
container (26) through a conduit (25). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the discharge 
port (18) in the support surface (3; 15, 16) opens into a 

steam distribution chamber (12) provided underneath the 
support surface (3; 15, 16) and connected in turn to a 

steam generating means supplied with energy from the heat 
source (2).  

 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the discharge 
port (9, 10; 18) in the support surface (3; 15, 16) is 

closable by a flap structure (19) or a valve. 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that
 the flap 
structure (19) or the valve is moved to its open position 

by a cup (7, 8; 23) as the cup (7, 8; 23) is placed on 
the support surface (3; 15, 16). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that
 the flap 
structure (19) or the valve are maintained in a closed 

position by a spring (22), the spring force being of a 
magnitude sufficient to be overcome by the weight of a 

cup (7, 8; 23). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the discharge 
port(s) (9, 10; 18) provided in the support surface 

(3; 15, 16) is (are) in direct communication with a 
steam generating means supplied with energy from the heat 

source (2). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the water 
reservoir (1) is permanently upwardly towards the cup (7, 

8; 23). 
The coffee maker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the size of 
the support surface (3; 15, 16) conforms to the size of 

the opening of the water reservoir (1).
