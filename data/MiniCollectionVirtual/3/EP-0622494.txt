<ABSTRACT>
The support carriers (16) firmly connected to an edge lamella (11) in the edge construction (15) are located exclusively via at least one spring component (17). All spring components (17) of such a locating position are on all sides firmly attached to a common coupling piece (16) releasably fixed to the support carrier (16). The spring components (17) of a locating position are firmly fitted to a common connecting component (19) which is releasable connected to the edge construction (15). The spring components are formed as elastomer bearings (17), and are vulcanised to the coupling piece (18). The coupling piece (18), elastomer bearing (17) and connecting component (18) are vulcanised in one piece.

Road joint (1, 2, 3) for expansion joints (5) with at least one chord plate (11) running 
parallel to the joint edges, in which each chord plate is fixed securely to its bearing points on a 

support girder (16) allocated exclusively to it, which extends over the entire width of the joint and 
is mounted displaceably in an edge structure (15) at the joint edges (4), and in which the distance 

between the chord plates and to the edges of the joint is controlled by a chain of springs, whereby 
the support girders of the edge chord plate immediately adjacent to a joint edge are mounted in the 

edge structure of this joint edge so that force can be dissipated in all directions and controlled by at 
least one spring element (17) respectively which simultaneously introduces the bearing forces 

directed vertically upwards and horizontally into the edge structure, in that it is connected, so that it 
cannot be displaced, finely in the longitudinal direction of the support girder allocated to it and 

secondly to the edge structure in the longitudinal and transverse direction of the joint, characterised 
by the fact that the support girders (16) fixed securely to an edge chord (11) are mounted in the 

edge structure (15) exclusively via the spring element(s) (17) and that all the spring elements (17) 
of a mounting point ofthis kind are fixed securely on all sides to a common coupling piece (18), 

which is fitted to the support girder (16) so that it can be detached and which is also fixed securely 
but detachably to the edge structure (15). 
Road joint in accordance with claim 1, characterised by the that that the spring elements 
(17) of a mounting point are attached securely to a common connecting element (19), which 

surrounds them, which is fixed to the edge structure (15) so that it can be detached. 
Road joint in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised by the fact that the spring 
elements are designed as elastomer bearings (17) and vulcanised on to the coupling piece (18).  

 
Road joint in accordance with claim 2 and 3, characterised by the fad that the coupling 
piece (18), elastomer bearing (17) and connecting element (19) are vulcanised together to form one 

component. 
Road joint in accordance with claim 2 or 4, characterised by the fact that the connecting 
element is designed as a frame (19) which is arranged transverse to the longitudinal axis (20) ofthe 

support girder (16). 
Road joint in accordance with claim 5, characterised by the fact that the flame (19) is only 
attached to one wall ofthe edge structure (15). 
Road joint in accordance with claim 5 or 6, characterised by the fact that the frame (19) has 
a top and bottom plate (21, 22), which are connected together by two web plates at the sides (23) 

arranged at a distance from each other to form a space, whereby the coupling piece (18) and the 
spring elements (17) are arranged in the space. 
Road joint in accordance with claim 7, characterised by the fact that the base plate (22), 
viewed in a plane transverse to the longitudinal direction of the support girder, projects laterally 

beyond the connecting web plates (23) and is screwed to a lower sealing wall (28) of the edge 
structure (15) with projecting screws (29). 
Road joint in accordance with claim 7, characterised by the fact that the frame (19) is 
attached to brackets (31) on the edge structure (15) via fishplates (30) which project laterally from 

the connecting web plates (23).  
 
Road joint in accordance with claim 9, characterised by the fact that the base plate (22) of 
the frame (19) is arranged so that there is a space between it and a lower sealing wall (28) of the 

edge structure (15). 
Road joint in accordance with one of the claims 7 to 10, characterised by the fact that the 
top plate (21) ofthe frame is attached so that there is a space between it and an upper sealing wall 

(14) ofthe edge structure (15). 
Road joint in accordance with one ofthe claims 1 to 11, characterised by the fact that the 

spring elements (17) are stress-free when installed. 
Road joint in accordance with one ofthe claims 1 to 12, characterised by the fact that two 
spring elements (17) are provided, one above the other, for each mounting point. 
Road joint in accordance with claim 5 and claim 13 and one of the claims 7 to 11, 
characterised by the fact that the spring elements (17) are attached to the top and/or the bottom 

plate (21, 22) ofthe frame (19), and that connecting web plates (23) run at a distance laterally from 
the spring elements (17). 
Road joint in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 14, characterised by the fact that the 
coupling piece (18) is seated on a bolt (26) attached to the end of the support girder (16) in the 

longitudinal direction of the latter.  
 
Road joint in accordance with one ofthe claims 1 to 15, characterised by the fact that each 
support girder (16) of the edge chord plates (11) is divided at least once transverse to its 

longitudinal direction and the coupling piece is formed by an end component (33) which is not 
directly connected to the edge chord plate (11) and is connected by screws to a central component 

(32) ofthe support girder (16).
