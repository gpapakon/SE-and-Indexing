<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling the switches (S1-S4) of a bridge circuit (1) is indicated, in which method, if no voltage is intended to be applied to the load (ZL), the switches are short-circuited via the load. In every case, this provides a defined potential via the load, and the source impedance, as evidenced by the load, is essentially constant. Bridge circuits controlled with the method according to the invention can therefore also be used for applications which require a defined and constant source impedance.
