<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an adjusting device for a disc brake, in particular a floating-caliper disc brake. The adjusting device has a force-dependent coupling (23) which lies on that side of an adjusting mechanism (15) which faces the brake disc, between an application shaft (8) and an adjusting shaft (16). One part (20) of the coupling is fixed rotationally on the adjusting shaft and in such a way as to be non-displaceable axially, at least in the direction away from the brake disc. The remainder of the adjusting mechanism can be moved axially away from the pressure screw against an elastic restoring force.

Adjustment device for a disc brake, specifically a floating caliper disc brake, with 
a minimum of one adjuster shaft (16) turning a pressure spindle (10) that abuts 

against a brake pad backing plate (3) and is screwed into a push rod (9) which is 
activated via clamping shaft (8) to travel towards the brake disc (2) equipped with 

a load dependent clutch (23) utilising an adjuster unit (1 5) between the clamping 
shaft (8) and adjuster shaft (16) whereby 


the load dependent clutch (23) is positioned on the pressure spindle (10) side of 
the adjuster unit (15) 
a part (20) of the load dependent clutch (23) is rigid and abuts axially in opposite 
direction of the pressure spindle (10) against the adjuster shaft (16) and 
the adjuster unit (15) is allowed to slide against an elastic retracting force in 
opposite direction of the pressure spindle (10). 
Adjustment device according to claim 1, characterised by the load dependent 
clutch (23) consisting of a locking ratchet gear and the remaining adjuster 

mechanism (15) designed to slide in opposite direction of the pressure spindle (10) 
a specific distance at least equal to that of the space between one of the teeth of 

the ratchet gear. 
Adjustment device according to claim 1, characterised by the load dependent 
clutch (23) being a spring loaded ratchet lock. 
Adjustment device according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by 
the adjuster unit (15) being located on the brake disc side of the clamping shaft 

(8). 
Adjustment device according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by 
the utilisation of a device to maintain free space (30) for the axial displacement of 

the adjuster unit (15). 
Adjustment device according to claim 5, characterised by the free space 
maintaining device (30) utilising at least two retaining rings (19, 21). 
Adjustment device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised by free space 
maintaining device (30) utilising a distance bushing. 
Adjustment device according to one of the above listed claims, characterised by 
the clutch of the adjuster unit (15) together with the clamping shaft (8) and/or the 

pressure spindle (10) determining the air gap (S) of the brake. 
Adjustment device according to claim 8, characterised by the clutch being 
equipped with a pin / groove joint, whereby, corresponding to the air gap (S) of the 

brake, the pin (26) interlocks with the groove (32). 
Adjustment device according to claim 9, characterised by the groove (32) being 
open on the clamping shaft (8) opposite of the brake disc.
