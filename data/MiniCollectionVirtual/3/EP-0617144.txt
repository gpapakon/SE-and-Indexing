<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an acidic cleaning aqueous solution for 
aluminum and aluminum alloy and a process for cleaning the same, 

intended to execute acidic cleaning without using harmful fluoric 
and chloric ions. 
The oxidation-reduction potential of a cleaning bath is 
controlled to be at 0.5 to 0.8V (vs. Ag-AgCl). The cleaning 

bath is obtained by diluting an acidic cleaning aqueous solution 
for aluminum and aluminum alloy to a predetermined volume. The 

acidic cleaning aqueous solution contains specified amounts of 
at least one of inorganic acids, Br⁻ ions and oxidized metal 

ions, with the addition of a surfactant and oxidizing agent if 
necessary. 
It is thus possible to present a uniform etching effect 
irrespective of low temperature (below 60
o
C) without containing 
fluoric ions and chromic ions within the acidic cleaning aqueous 

solution. Br⁻ also has an effect of inhibiting the oxidation-decomposition 
reaction of the surfactant arising from the oxidizing 

agent and oxidized metal ions, thereby obtaining a long-life 
acidic cleaning aqueous solution .

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an acidic cleaning aqueous 
solution for aluminum and aluminum alloy and a process for 
cleaning the same, and more particularly to the use of a cleaning aqueous 
solution and the cleaning process capable of satisfactorily 
removing lubricant oil and aluminum powder adhering on aluminum 
surfaces due to fabrication. Aluminum articles such as beverage containers made of 
aluminum or aluminum alloy, are customarily manufactured by a 
metal-forming operation called "drawing and ironing" (hereinafter 
referred to as DI processing). In the course of this and 
similar metal-forming operations a lubricant oil is applied to 
the surface of the metal being deformed, and some abraded aluminum 
particles and other contaminates (usually referred to as 
"smut") adhere to the metal surface, especially to the inner 
walls of such beverage containers. The surfaces of such types 
of containers are protected by subsequent chemical-conversion 
coating and/or paint coating techniques. Therefore, the above-mentioned 
lubricant oil or smut must be removed, by cleaning, 
from the metal surfaces before the chemical-conversion coating. This surface cleaning is normally applied by means of an 
acidic cleaning agent which appropriately etches the metal  
 
surfaces. Till now the acidic cleaning agents used for smut-removal 
have generally been ones containing chromic acid or 
hydrofluoric acid. Especially, the cleaning agent containing 
the hydrofluoric acid is superior in enabling the low-temperature 
acidic cleaning (up to 50°C). However, the chromic acid 
and hydrofluoric acid are harmful substances, and hence control 
of their liquid waste is strict. Thus, demanded in recent years 
is an establishment of chromium-free or fluorine-free low-temperature 
acidic cleaning techniques. Such chromium-free or fluorine-free acidic cleaning techniques 
are proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4728456 titled "Aluminum 
surface cleaning agent", U.S. Patent No. 4851148 titled "Method 
of controlling an aluminum surface cleaning composition", and WO 
9301332-A1 titled "Method and acidic composition for cleaning aluminum". In U.S. Patent No. 4728456 and 4851148, respectively, 
titled "Aluminum surface cleaning agent" and "Method of controlling 
an aluminum surface cleaning composition", disclosed are a 
cleaning agent including an acidic cleaning agent of pH 2 or 
below prepared from sulfuric acid and nitric acid containing 
little or no fluoric ions with the addition of ferric ions 
serving as accelerator
