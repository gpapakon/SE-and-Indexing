<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to the targeting of drugs, peptides, and proteins to the brain. Liposomes containing the compound to be delivered are coupled to antibody binding fragments which bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier. The targeted receptors include transferrin receptor, insulin receptor, IGF-I and IGF-II receptors, among others. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and methods for administering the drugs to a subject in need by means of the receptor-targeted immunoliposomes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the delivery of
drugs into the brain by transcytosis across the blood-brain
barrier. More particularly, the invention relates to the
targeting of drug-containing liposomes to the blood-brain
barrier by means of antibodies and binding fragments thereof
which bind to receptors on capillary endothelial cells of the
brain.Delivery of many drugs, particularly nonlipophilic
drugs, to the mammalian brain is restricted by the blood-brain
barrier. The barrier is due in part to tight intercellular
junctions between brain capillary endothelial cells and
prevents the passive movement of many substances from the
blood to the brain. The brain endothelial cells lack
continuous gaps or channels connecting the luminal and
abluminal membranes which would otherwise allow the passage of
blood-borne molecules into the brain tissue. Instead, the
presence of specific transport systems within the capillary
endothelial cells, such as those for insulin, amino acids,
glucose and transferrin, assure the controlled transport of
compounds necessary to the functioning of the brain.Various strategies have been developed to deliver
drugs into the brain that would not otherwise be able to cross
the blood-brain barrier. Commonly, although quite
undesirably, an intraventricular catheter is surgically
implanted to deliver a drug directly into the brain. Not only
does this involve an invasive procedure that itself is
potentially harmful to the patient, but the drug delivered by 
this means is only superficially distributed within the brain.Other strategies have been devised to circumvent the
blood-brain barrier. Some pharmacologic approaches involve
chemically converting hydrophilic drugs into more lipid-soluble
forms so they are more easily transported across the
barrier. Another approach involves transiently opening the
barrier by infusing hypertonic substances intra-arterially to
allow passage of hydrophilic drugs, although hypertonic
substances may be associated with toxicity and even damage the
barrier.More recently, it has been proposed to link
hydrophilic neuropharmaceutical agents such as neuropeptides
to other peptides which are themselves capable of crossing the
blood-brain barrier by transcytosis. U.S. Patent No.
4,801,575 to Pardridge describes the preparation of chimeric
peptides by coupling or conjugating the pharmaceutical agent
to a transportable peptide. The chimeric peptide purportedly
passes across the barrier via receptors for the transportable
peptide. Transportable peptides, or
