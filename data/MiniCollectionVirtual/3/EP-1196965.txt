<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a helical antenna (1) which can be supplied with various radiating characteristics in different modes. The helical antenna (1) comprises four electrically conductive helical limbs (11, 12, 13, 14) which are guided in an approximately parallel manner. The helical limbs (11, 12, 13, 14) are connected via their respective inner helical limb ends (5, 6, 7, 8) to a coplanar line (2) for supplying and/or receiving signals.

<CLAIMS>
Spiral antenna (1) having four approximately
parallel and electrically conductive spiral arms

(11, 12, 13, 14), 
characterized in that
 the spiral
arms (11, 12, 13, 14) are connected at their

respective inner spiral arm end (5, 6, 7, 8) to a
common coplanar line (2) for feeding and/or

receiving signals, with the coplanar line (2) and
the spiral antenna (1) being mounted on the same

substrate material.
Spiral antenna (1) according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the coplanar line (2)
comprises an inner conductor (21; 30) and at least

one reference earth potential surface (22, 23; 35,
36), with the inner conductor (21; 30) and the at

least one reference earth potential surface (22,
23; 35, 36) each being connected to two of the

four inner spiral arms ends (5, 6, 7, 8).
Spiral antenna (1) according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the coplanar line (2) is
arranged at right angles to the plane of the

spiral antenna (1).
Spiral antenna (1) according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
coplanar line (2) is at least partially in the

form of a taper. 
Spiral antenna (1) according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the spiral
antenna (1) is in the form of an Archimedes spiral

or a logarithmic spiral.
Spiral antenna (1) according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the spiral
antenna (1) is fed with a symmetrical electrical

field distribution on the coplanar line (2), thus

resulting in an omnidirectional polar diagram
characteristic.
Spiral antenna (1) according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the spiral
antenna (1) is fed with an asymmetric electrical

field distribution on the coplanar line (2), thus
resulting in a directional polar diagram

characteristic.
Spiral antenna (1) according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the spiral
antenna (1) is arranged in or on the bodywork of a

vehicle.
