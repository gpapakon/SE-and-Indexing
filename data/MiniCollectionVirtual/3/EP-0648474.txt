<ABSTRACT>
A blunt tip surgical needle which significantly 
reduces the probability of skin penetration of the 

gloved hand of an operator is disclosed. The blunt tip 
needle includes a tip portion having at least one flat 

surface. The flat surface(s) blends smoothly between 
each other and with the outer surface of the tip portion 

such that the entire tip portion has a continuously 
smooth outer surface lacking any discontinuities or 

sharp edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical
needles and, more particularly, to a blunt surgical
needle wherein the needle tip portion
blends smoothly into the needle and
decrease potential skin penetration of the gloved hand
of an operator.Everyone today is well aware of the severity of
contracting Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The members
of professions that must deal on a daily basis with the
risk of coming in contact with people that do or may
have HIV or AIDS are acutely aware of the severity.
Members of the medical profession, especially surgeons,
are in an extremely high risk position when performing
operations. The knowledge that infectious diseases such
as the AIDS virus can spread by an accidentally
inflicted needle stick from a contaminated needle
administered to the person having AIDS is the cause for
much concern for the profession. These professionals
are therefore taking every precaution to reduce the
risks. For example, the use of double gloving, blunt
tipped needles and gloves thickened at the fingers are 
known to reduce the rate of glove puncture. In
addition, the use of forceps designed to grip both the
tissue and needle more effectively and the use of
staples for skin closure are also known to reduce the
incidence of glove puncture.Accordingly, there has been an increasing amount
of activity in the area of surgical needle tip design.
For example, U.S. Patent 4,828,547 to Sahi et al.
discloses a needle having a blunting member which is
moveable from a retracted position to an extended
position. In the retracted position, the blunting
member does not interfere with the puncture tip of the
needle. In the extended position, the blunting member
extends beyond the puncture tip and therefor acts as a
guard against accidental needle sticks. Further
examples of shield or guard type assemblies for syringe
needles are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,883,469 to
Glazier and 4,883,471 to Braginetz et al.The devices disclosed above are useful for
hypodermic syringe needles which are disposed of after a
single stick. This design would not be practical for
use with surgical needles since such needles must make
repeated sticks into the body.U.S. Patent No. 5,123,910 to McIntosh on which the two-part
form of claim 1 below is delimited discloses a
tapered needle tip having a circular cross-section and
terminating in a blunt head. The blunt head has a part
spherical or other curved shape with no sharp edge 
surfaces. The problem with the prior art
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surgical needle (10) comprising:

a body portion (14);and
a tip portion (16) having a blunt tip at a distal end
thereof and a smooth outer surface,

   characterised in that the tip portion (16) has a circular
cross-section which decreases progressively toward the distal end, which

terminates in a flat surface (18), said flat surface blending
smoothly with an outer surface of said tip portion (16) such

that the tip portion (16) has a continuously smooth outer
surface lacking any discontinuities or sharp cutting edges.
The surgical needle (10) according to
claim 1, further including a suture mounting portion (12)

having a hole (20) to which a suture (22) is to be attached,

the body portion (14) being disposed between and contiguous
with said suture mounting portion (12) and said tip portion

(16). 
The surgical needle (10) according to claim 2, wherein
said body portion (14) has a generally uniform cross-sectional

area throughout an entire length thereof.
The surgical needle (10) according to claim 3, wherein
said cross-sectional area of said body portion (14) has a

shape selected from the group consisting of circular,
square, modified square, rectangular and flat pressed

circular.
The surgical needle (10) according to any preceding
claim, wherein said needle (10) has an overall curved shape

with a constant radius of curvature.
