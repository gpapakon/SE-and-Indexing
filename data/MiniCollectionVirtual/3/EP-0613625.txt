<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a hygienic 
protecting cap which can be applied to the inside 

of helmets in general and 
comprises a die-cut plate-like element (1), 

made of an absorbing material. The periphery of said plate-like element 
(1) is provided with hollow portions (6,7,9), cut-outs (2) and recesses 

(10) in order to facilitate the bending, the fitting and the coupling of 
said cap to the helmet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hygienic 
protecting cap, which can be applied to the inside 
of helmets in general, and adapted to cover the inner 
padding layer of the helmet, and being specifically 
designed for interposing between the padding 
and the user scalp. At present there are already applied several 
types of paddings to the inside of helmets, i.e. 
both sport helmets and work helmets. As is known, a helmet is affected by serious 
hygienic problems, since the person bearing 
the helmet frequently sweats, thereby causing the 
padding to be impregnated by beads of perspiration. This problem is aggravated as the helmet 
is used by several persons. In such a case, the person frequently will 
bear a helmet which is not suitable from a mere 
hygienic standpoint. The document US-A-5 022 095 discloses a liner for hard hats 
including an elastic band attached to the lower edge of the 
liner so that the liner can be slipped over the beak and the 
interior support of the hard hat, the liner having elongated 
sides so that the liner can be folded over the lower periphery 
of the hat.  
 Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned problem, 
by providing a hygienic protecting cap, to be applied 
to the inside of helmets in general, which  
 
can be easily and quickly fitted to a lot of different 
types of helmets, while providing a product 
which can be easily made, with a high yield, on industrial 
making systems. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a protecting cap which is specifically 
adapted to absorb the sweat thereby assuring 
very good hygienic conditions for the inside of the 
helmet, and which, moreover, can be made by simple 
cutting operations and may be quickly and simply 
applied to the inside of the helmet, while having 
a very reduced making cost. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a protecting cap which can be 
also constructed as a disposable or single-use cap. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a hygienic protecting cap which 
can be made starting from easily available materials, 
such as cellulose materials, fabric materials 
or other materials having high sweat or perspiration 
absorbing protperties and high protection 
properties with respect to the dust or other 
outer polluting agents.  
 Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a protecting cap which, 
owing to its structural features, is

<CLAIMS>
A hygienic protecting cap, for 
application to the inside of helmets in general, 

characterized in that said protecting cap comprises a 
die-cut plate-like element (1) made of either a 

cellulose or textile absorbing material and provided, 
on the periphery thereof, with a plurality of 

peripheral recesses (2,6,7,9,10,23,24,27) and 
projections (8,28 ..) and, through the surface of 

said plate like element, a plurality of perspiration 
holes (15,32) adapted to facilitate the fitting of 

said cap to the inner surface of the helmet. 
A protecting cap, according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, for a sport helmet, said 

plate-like element (1) has an elongated 
configuration, with a front peripheral recess or 

hollow portion (2), adjoining two front laps (3) 
delimited by side peripheral recesses, on each side 

of the plate-like element (1) there being moreover 
provided two central recesses (7,9), separated by a 

central peripheral projection (8). 
A protecting cap, according to Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that said peripheral recesses 

(2,6,7,9,10,23,24,27) comprise rear end peripheral 
recesses (10) of a substantially trapezoidal shape,  

 
adapted to operate as a restraining element for the 

connection to the helmet. 
A protecting cap, according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said plate-like element (1) comprises a rear lug 
(13). 
A protecting cap, according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said cap comprises aeration cells (4) through said 
flaps (3) and in the portion included between said 

trapezoidal peripheral recesses (10). 
A protecting cap, according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said cap comprises, at the free end portions of the 
front flaps (3) and rear lug (13), perforation lines 

(5,14) for tearing away the excess portions of said 
plate-like element (1). 
A protecting cap (20), according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that, for work helmets, said plate-like element (1) 
is provided with a rounded front lug, delimited by 

intermediate side peripheral recesses (23), adjoining 
substantially trapezoidal peripheral central recesses 

(24), for fixedly engaging in the central portion of 
a head bearing inner support, rear lugs (29) being  

 
provided at the rear end portion, said rear lugs 

being delimited by a central loop portion (30), and 
through the middle portion of said plate-like element 

being provided perspiration holes (32). 
A protecting cap, according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that it further comprises, at the 

front region and rear lugs thereof, tearing lines 
(31) for tearing away the excess portions of said 

plate-like element.
