<ABSTRACT>
A pitch stabilized vessel includes at least one displacement hull constructed for high propulsion speeds, for instance speeds of 35 knots. The hull is configured in a manner to locate the pitching centre (PC) of the vessel far forwards on the hull, for instance at a point corresponding to 75 % of the length of the hull from the stern thereof. Generally horizontal and elongated fins (F) extend along the hull and project out from the actual hull in the stern half thereof. The fins (F) extend from the stern-edge of the hull through a distance corresponding to one-third the length of the hull. The fins have a total horizontally projected surface area which corresponds to at least 5 % of W/d, where W is the total underwater volume at construction draft and d is the hull construction draft. The total horizontally projected area of all fins provided on the type of vessel concerned shall thus be at least 5 % of the total area of the hull at the water line, this hull area being defined as W/d for respective hulls while taking into account the cross-sectional shape of the hull beneath the water line which gives the hull its forwardly-lying pitching centre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pitch stabilized, 
high-speed displacement vessel with which the pitching 
movement centre of the hull is located in the midship 
area of the hull or forwardly of the midship area. In conventional seagoing displacement vessels, the 
centre of pitching motion of the hull has been located 
more towards the stern of the hull than towards the 
bows. By pitching movement is meant the movement of the vessel 
or hull in its vertical midship plane as the vessel 
moves through the water. As the vessel moves through the 
water, it is also subjected to heaving movement, which 
can be considered as the vertical, parallel displacement 
to which the vessel is subjected as it follows the waves 
up and down. Thus, the vertical acceleration forces that act on the 
vessel at a given point are determined partly by heave 
and partly by pitch, i.e. the angular acceleration of 
the vessel times the lengthwise distance between the 
centre of pitching movement of the vessel and said given 
point. Pitching movement, i.e. angular acceleration of the 
vessel, is, of course, dependent on the forward speed of 
the vessel in relation to the speed and direction of the 
waves, the relative speed between wave and vessel playing 
an important part in the acceleration of the vessel 
pitching movement. Vertical movement of a seagoing vessel, and particularly 
vertical acceleration, is considered to be the greatest  
 
contributory factor to seasickness and it has been found 
generally that conventional catamarans whose centre of 
pitching movement is located far out towards the stern 
and which are propelled at high speeds are extremely 
liable to subject passengers to powerful vertical acceleration 
forces. Naturally, it is also highly disadvantageous 
to subject the cargo of a vessel to pronounced 
vertical movements and to vertical acceleration forces 
in particular. In conventional displacement vessels, the height of the 
hull above the water and the pitching tendencies of the 
hull can be controlled with the aid of active stabilizing 
fins, which are controlled with the aid of sensors 
that detect the vertical acceleration of the vessel. 
Such control systems, however, are unsuitable for several 
reasons. For instance, the system must be capable of 
working very rapidly and includes movable fins which are 
sensitive to their own movement and which must be subjected 
to very powerful forces if they are to have any 
appreciable effect. Any malfunction of the fins or of 
the fin control system will
