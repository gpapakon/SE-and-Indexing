<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring device
for an amount of charge of toner particles and an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine having the measuring
device.As a measuring method for an amount of charge of
toner, a blow-off method is known.In the blow-off method, a two-component developer composed
of toner particles and carrier particles is placed on a
retaining member having meshes which are bigger than a
diameter of a toner particle and are smaller than a 
diameter of a carrier particle, and only the toner
particles are blown off by dry air blow (for example,
nitrogen). Then, an amount of charge of carrier remaining
on the retaining member is measured so that an amount of
charge of toner is obtained by the weight.However, with the blow-off method, since a measured
value changes with flow of dry air blow and a time
required for measurement, it is difficult to measure an
accurate amount of charge of toner. Moreover,
distribution of the amount of charge cannot be obtained.
Further, since a Mono component developer does not include
carriers, an amount of charge of toner cannot be
theoretically measured by using the Mono component developer.The Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
JP-A-Sho 57-79958 discloses the following
method. Toner particles are introduced into a chamber
where air blow has been sent at a uniform speed and a
uniform electric field has been formed, the toner
particles which have passed through the electric field are
accumulated on a sheet and distribution of the toner
particle on the sheet is measured so that distribution of
a relative amount of charge of toner is obtained.However, in the above method, since it is necessary
to take out sheets where the toner particles are 
accumulated for every measurement, there exists a problem
that successive measurement cannot be made. Moreover,
there exists a problem that an amount of charge of each
toner particle cannot be measured.The Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
JP-A-Sho 61-277071 discloses the following
method. Toner particles are allowed to freely fall to a
vertical passage where an electric field has been formed,
a laser beam is irradiated to toner which passes a
measurement position and a speed of the toner particles is
measured from Doppler frequency of a scattered light so
that an amount of charge and distribution of the amount of
charge are obtained.However, in this method, since momentum of the toner
particles is small, the toner particles adhere to a wall
surface of the passage. Therefore, there
