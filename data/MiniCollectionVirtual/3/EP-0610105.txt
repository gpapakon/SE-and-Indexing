<ABSTRACT>
The pointer includes an indicator arm (1) which extends from a head (2) which is designed to receive light (L) from below and to illuminate the arm and, for homogenising the illumination along the arm, a filtering homogenisation layer (6) which is applied onto the top (5) of the arm (1). The invention is well-suited to motor vehicle dashboard pointers.

<CLAIMS>
Dial needle comprising an indicator arm (1') extending from a head
(2) arranged to receive light (L) from below and to illuminate the arm, a filtering

layer for homogenizing the illumination along the arm, and a colour layer (9),

characterized in that

this filtering homogenizing layer is a screen layer (10),
the colour layer is a nocturnal colour layer (9), disposed against the filtering layer
(10) and is intended to be illuminated through the filtering layer,
and in that the layers are applied by serigraphy onto an intermediate support (7)
which, with the layers (10, 9), forms a luminous stratified structure (6')

overmoulded on the upper side (5') of the arm (1') of the needle and forming an
integrated needle cap (15').
Dial needle according to Claim 1, characterized in that the openings
in the screen are closely spaced by the needle head (2) and gradually widen

towards the end of the needle (13).
