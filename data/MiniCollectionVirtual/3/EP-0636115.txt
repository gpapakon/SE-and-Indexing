A 3,4-bis(4-X-phenyl)-3-hexene in which the groups 
X in each case represent optionally substituted 

alkyl residues with 2 to 4 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl 
residues with up to 4 carbon atoms, alkenyl or 

alkinyl residues with up to 10 carbon atoms or 
optionally substituted aralkyl residues with 1 to 

10 non-aromatic carbon atoms. 
Compound as claimed in claim 1,
wherein
 
the groups X represent, alkenyl or alkinyl residues 

each with up to 5 carbon atoms which are 
substituted if desired. 
Compounds as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein
 
the groups X are ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, 

sec.-butyl or tert.-butyl residues. 
Process for the production of a compound as claimed 
in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein
 
a 1-(4-X-phenyl)-1-propanone in which X is defined 

as in claim 1, is reacted in the presence of a 
transition metal chloride, zinc dust and a base in 

an inert solvent and the desired compound is 
isolated from the reaction mixture by purification.  

 
Pharmaceutical composition,
wherein
 
it contains one or several compounds as claimed in 

one of the claims 1 to 3 as the active substance 
and if desired, conventional pharmaceutical carrier 

substances, fillers, diluents or/and auxiliary 
substances. 
Use of a compound as claimed in one of the claims 1 
to 3 for the production of a pharmaceutical 

composition for the treatment of diseases which are 
associated with degenerate cell growth. 
Use as claimed in claim 8 for the treatment of 
cancer, psoriasis or AIDS.
