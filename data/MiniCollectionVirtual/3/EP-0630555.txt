<ABSTRACT>
A pop-up sprinkler assembly for installation within 
the ground and for manual connection from a position above 

ground with an above ground hose as a source of water 
pressure. The pop-up sprinkler assembly includes a housing 

structure (12) having an annular opening and exterior (14) 
suitable for installation within the ground in a fixed 

operative position. The housing structure (12) has an inlet 
passageway (36) communicating with the annular opening. A 

hose connector (16) is in the passageway (36) for connection to 
an above ground hose (302). A sprinkler head (70) is 

mounted in the annular space that is generally at ground 
level when the sprinkler head is in a lower storage 

position. An annular seal (72) is provided between the 
sprinkler head and the housing structure (12) so that the 

communication of water pressure with the annular space 
results in water pressure-biased movement of the sprinkler 

head from the lower storage position to a raised operative 
position. The sprinkler has an outlet (122) for directing 

water under pressure outwardly thereof onto the ground in a 
predetermined pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sprinkler 
assemblies for installation within the ground and to hose 
connectors. There are generally two types of water 
sprinklers. The first type of water sprinkler is an 
above ground sprinkler which can be of the 
oscillating type, rotary type and step-by-step 
rotary type, among others. All of these types are 
well known in the prior art. These sprinklers are 
simply connected to one end of a hose, with the 
other end of the hose connected to a sill cock. 
These sprinklers all offer the major advantage of 
low purchase cost. One source of difficulty encountered with 
above ground sprinklers is the limited coverage area 
provided by a single sprinkler. Even with multiple 
sprinklers it is frequently necessary to have to 
repeatedly move the sprinklers from place to place 
to cover the entire lawn. Because of this 
difficulty, the usual alternative is to forget about 
sprinkling until the lawn is in danger of dying due 
to lack of water. All too often such sprinkling is 
either ineffective or too late. Another difficulty 
is that incorrect placement of the sprinkler results 
in either overwatering or underwatering of various 
areas on the lawn. The second type of water sprinkler is the 
underground sprinkler. A typical system consists of 
a series of pop-up sprinklers which are embedded in 
the ground at appropriate positions throughout the 
lawn area to be sprinkled. Usually the heads are  
 
divided into several watering areas embodying one or 
more than one sprinkler head, depending upon their 
capacity and the capacity of the water source 
available. The usual pop-up sprinkler includes a 
housing assembly adapted to be stationarily mounted 
in the ground and to be connected at its lower end 
with an in-ground supply pipe through which a 
controllable source of water under pressure is 
communicated with the housing assembly. Examples of 
pop-up sprinkler assemblies are shown in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,892,252, 4,353,506 and 3,921,910. The underground sprinkler systems offer 
many advantages over the above ground system. A 
major advantage is that there is complete lawn 
coverage by embedding the sprinklers into the ground 
at appropriate positions throughout the lawn area to 
be sprinkled. These systems are frequently 
automated in that various watering zones can be 
turned on and off in accordance with a selected 
program. This ease of operation usually results in 
correct sprinkling of all areas of the lawn. 
However, the high cost of burying underground supply 
pipes
