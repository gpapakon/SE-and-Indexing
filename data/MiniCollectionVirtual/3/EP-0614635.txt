<ABSTRACT>
Slats (2) are arranged spaced apart from one another between two longitudinal frame members so as to run transversely to the latter, and together form a substantially planar lying area. On the inside of the longitudinal frame members, one (4) of which is visible, there are supporting elements (5) for receiving the ends of slats combined to form pairs. Two mutually adjacent slat pairs (2a, 2c; 2b, 2d) are interconnected by a strengthening element (6). The strengthening element is displaceable longitudinally to the slats and within certain limits parallel to the longitudinal frame members. Between the slat pairs and beneath them, a counter-slat (7) is fixed to supporting journals (28) via a supporting body (29). The fixing openings (30, 31) are shaped in such a way that displacement of the opening relative to the supporting journals along the longitudinal frame members is possible. Owing to the construction of the strengthening element which is fixed to the slats substantially in the interspaces of the individual slats forming a slat pair and owing to the construction of the supporting body (29), strengthening of the supporting force of the slats even at an articulation point (8) is possible.
