<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to aerosol formulations of use for the administration of medicaments by inhalation, in particular a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation which comprises particulate medicament, a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon propellant and up to 5 % w/w based upon propellant of a polar cosolvent, which formulation is substantially free of surfactant. A method of treating respiratory disorders which comprises administration by inhalation of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as defined is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aerosol formulations of use for the administration of 
medicaments by inhalation. The use of aerosols to administer medicaments has been known for several decades. 
Such aerosols generally comprise the medicament, one or more chlorofluorocarbon 
propellants and either a surfactant or a solvent, such as ethanol. The most commonly 
used aerosol propellants for medicaments have been propellant 11 (CCl₃F) and/or 
propellant 114 (CF₂ClCF₂Cl) with propellant 12 (CCl₂F₂). However these propellants are 
now believed to provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone and there is thus a need 
to provide aerosol formulations for medicaments which employ so called "ozone-friendly" 
propellants. A class of propellants which are believed to have minimal ozone-depleting effects in 
comparison to conventional chlorofluorocarbons comprise fluorocarbons and 
hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons, and a number of medicinal aerosol 
formulations using such propellant systems are disclosed in, for example, EP 0372777, 
WO91/04011, WO91/11173, WO91/11495 and WO91/14422. These applications are all 
concerned with the preparation of pressurised aerosols for the administration of 
medicaments and seek to overcome the problems associated with the use of the new class 
of propellants, in particular the problems of stability associated with the pharmaceutical 
formulations prepared. The applications all propose the addition of one or more of 
adjuvants such as alcohols, alkanes, dimethyl ether, surfactants (including fluorinated and 
non-fluorinated surfactants, carboxylic acids, polyethoxylates etc) and even conventional 
chlorofluorocarbon propellants in small amounts intended to minimise potential ozone 
damage. Thus, for example EP 0372777 requires the use of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in 
combination with both a cosolvent having greater polarity than 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(e.g. an alcohol or a lower alkane) and a surfactant in order to achieve a stable 
formulation of a medicament powder. In particular it is noted in the specification at page  
 
3, line 7 that "it has been found that the use of propellant 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) 
and drug as a binary mixture or in combination with a conventional 
surfactant such as sorbitan trioleate does not provide formulations having suitable 
properties for use with pressurised inhalers". Surfactants are generally recognised by 
those skilled in the art to be essential components of aerosol formulations, required not 
only to reduce aggregation of
