<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for removing a hide (20) from an animal carcass (10). The animal carcass is initially opened to provide an edge (21) of the hide and the edge is pulled in a direction (PP) tranverse to the longitudinal direction (LL) so as to separate the hide progressively from the carcass until a strip of hide (25) remains attached along the spine. The strip of hide (25) is then cleared by moving a clearing means (40) along between the carcass and the strip of hide. During both hide pulling and clearing, the carcass (10) is supported in the supine position with the anterior end (16) of the carcass lower than the posterior end (15). During pulling, the line of dislocation (16) of the hide from the carcass is maintained substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction (LL). The direction (PP) of application of the pulling force is maintained so that the hide (20) is essentially peeling back upon itself away from the subcutaneous tissues of the carcass. Tension is applied to the hide in the longitudinal direction (LL) after the step of hide pulling and before commencement of the longitudinal clearing step. The hide (20) is pulled from the head (14) at the end of the step of clearing the strip of hide (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANIMAL HIDE REMOVAL This invention relates to a process and apparatus for removing the hide from an animal carcass. sThe removal of the hide from an animal carcass by pulling the 5 hide is, in general terms, a known process. During an initial dressing stage after the animal has been slaughtered, various preli~ιinary operations are manually carried out on the carcass. These preliminary preparations carried out on the carcass may ∞-prise the following: 10 1. The foreleg and rear leg hocks are removed and the pizzle or udders removed.2. The hide is cleared from the inside portion of the two rear legs down to the navel, exposing the flank and clearing the outside of each leg over the roll of the silverside, and along to the gam15 string.3. The hide is cleared from the navel to the stick wound, clearing the neck hide sufficiently to clear the conical muscle.4. The inside of both forelegs and each side of the brisket are cleared. The outsides of the forelegs are cleared over the shoulder,20 exposing the top edge of the rosette.5. The flanks are dressed down until they are above the edge of the rosette.6. The muzzle is removed and the ears are cleared.7. The rectum is separated from the hide by separating the anal 25 sphincter muscles. The rectum is then sealed.Although not all of these steps are always carried out, and sometimes there are additional preliminary preparations, these preparations listed are typical for an automated or mechanical hide removal system.30 In Australian patent specification No. 29,199/89, and in the equivalent TJS Patent No. 5,062,820, there is described in relation to Figs. 4 and 5 of the drawings of that specification, a hide pulling system in which clamps engage edges of the hide which have been cut free from the belly in the preliminary dressing operations. The hide35 is pulled downwardly and then the pulling angle is progressively changed so that hide is pulled from the forequarter back towards the hindquarter of the carcass. This process and apparatus, and other 

similar processes which utilise pulling the hide outwardly away from or along the carcass, damages the carcass and may also leave valuable meat and/or fat portions attached to the hide with consequent loss of saleable mass of the carcass and the need for additional processing of the hide to remove such matter. The damage can be caused by pulling the fat away from the carcass, e.g. from the loin flank, hip and ru-p areas. Also the muscle tissue imnediately beneath the hide, particularly the cutaneous trunci, also

3. A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the transverse direction (PP) does not intersect the longitudinal line of the spine.
4. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that a preliminary dressing operation is carried out to open and clear the hide (20) ventrally along the length of the carcass (10) so as to produce edges (21) of the hide, the hide pulling step comprising engaging the edges (21) of the hide followed by the application of pulling forces applied to the hide edges (21) in the transverse direction (PP).
5. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the carcass (10) is supported in the supine position with the legs (11,12) of the animal extending upwardly, the spine of the carcass (10) being inclined to the horizontal with the anterior end (16) of the c-arcass (10) lower than the posterior end (15) of the carcass.
6. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the step of pulling the hide (20) is carried 


out so that the line of dislocation (16) of the hide from the carcass is inaintained substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction (LL), the line of dislocation (16) being defined as the line along which separation of the hide (20) from the carcass (10) is c»ccurring during the hide pulling step.

8. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the hide (20), as it is being pulled in the transverse direction (PP) from the carcass (10), defines in a plane generally orthogonal to the longitudinal direction (LL) an angle of dislocation (θ) being the angle defined between a line being formed by the hide (20) as it is being pulled from the carcass and a tangent (17) to the carcass (10) at the point of separation of the hide from the carcass, the angle of dislocation (θ) being maintained at a relatively small value throughout the step of pulling of the hide.

11. A process as claimed in Claim 8, 9 or 10 characterised in that the angle of dislocation (θ) is maintained at a relatively small value by changing the direction of the line being forrtied by the hide (20) as it is pulled away from the carcass (10) by changing the direction of the pulling force as the step of pulling the hide (20) progresses. 12. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in that the transverse direction (PP), being the direction of application of the pulling force, is maintained so that the hide (20) during the pulling step is essentially peeling back upon itself away from the subcπjtaneous tissues of the carcass (10) so as to rtiinimise damage to the subcutaneous tissues.
