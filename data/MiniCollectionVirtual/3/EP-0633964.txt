which includes conductive pigments provided with an

electrically conductive layer of doped metal oxide,
characterized in that the said conductive pigments have

a lamellar-type basic structure.
Sheet according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the pigments having a lamellar structure are selected

from micas, talc, kaolin, bentonites, montmorillonites or
particles of glass.
Sheet according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the doped metal oxide of the electrically conductive

layer is an antimony-doped tin oxide.
Sheet according to Claims 2 and 3, characterized
in that the conductive pigment is a mica coated with a

layer of antimony-doped tin oxide.
Sheet according to Claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that the conductive pigment is a mica covered with a

layer of titanium oxide, optionally with a layer of
silica, and coated with a layer of antimony-doped tin

oxide.
Sheet according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that it bears on at least one side a layer containing
