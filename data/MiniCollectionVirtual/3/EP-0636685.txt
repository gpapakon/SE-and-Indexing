<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing a foam control agent with 1 to 30 
parts of a silicone antifoam and 70 to 99 parts of a zeolite 

carrier, with the ability to release some of the antifoam 
within 10 minutes of being dispersed in an aqueous surfactant 

solution, by depositing 5 to 70% of the antifoam of an organo-polysiloxane 
polyoxyalkylene copolymer, onto the zeolite 

carrier not later than depositing the silicone antifoam. Also 
claimed is the use of the copolymer to achieve that end and 

compositions where the antifoam is branched or high viscosity. 
Also claimed is encapsulated agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foam control agents which 
are particulate, and especially those which are intended 
for incorporation in detergent compositions which are in 
powder form. The invention is particularly concerned 
with silicone based foam control agents in powder form. 
The invention also relates to the use of the foam control 
agents, and to a method of improving the release of foam 
control agents during the wash cycle. Foam control agents based on silicone antifoams, 
and foam control agents which are in particulate form, 
are well known in the art. Many patent specification 
describe such foam control agents. Silicone base foam 
control agents for powder detergent compositions are also 
well known. Many patent specifications describe the 
problems of diminishing foam control ability of the 
silicone based foam control agents when stored in powder 
detergents for prolonged periods of time. Solutions to 
overcome the storage problem have been suggested and 
include the use of a variety of materials as encapsulating 
or protective materials, intended to coat or bind 
the silicone antifoam. The theory is that encapsulation 
or binding counteracts the unwanted spreading of the 
silicone oil of the antifoam onto the surrounding detergent 
powder, which spreading results in the reduction of 
the concentration of one of the most important ingredients 
of the foam control agents, and in extreme cases 
depleting the foam control agent of the silicone oil 
altogether, thus deactivating the foam control agent. In 
combination with the use of such encapsulating or protective 
materials a carrier material is often used.  
 
Carrier materials are often used in combination with the 
foam control agents to make these foam control agents 
into a more substantial and more easily handled solid 
particulate material, which can be post-blended as a 
powder with the rest of the powder detergent composition. Materials which are suggested as carrier materials 
for particulate silicone based foam control agents 
include water soluble, water insoluble and water dispersible 
materials. Examples of suggested carrier materials 
are sulphates, carbonates, phosphates, polyphosphates, 
silicas, silicates, clays, starches, cellulosic materials 
and aluminosilicates. The use of carrier materials adds 
a component to the final composition of the detergent 
powder. If the carrier material is not itself a component 
which contributes to the efficiency or activity of 
the powder detergent, it will in effect constitute an 
additio
