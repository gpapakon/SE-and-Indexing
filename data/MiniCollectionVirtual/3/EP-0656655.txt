<ABSTRACT>
A deep trench type DRAM cell with shallow trench isolation
has a buried polysilicon strap that is defined without the use of

a separate mask by depositing the strap material over at least
the deep trench before shallow trench definition and using the

shallow trench isolation mask to overlap partially the deep
trench, thereby defining the strap during the process of cutting

the shallow trench.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is that of integrated circuit
dynamic random access memories (DRAMS).In the field of DRAMs, the key issue is the size of the
individual cell. One approach that has been followed in the art is
the use of a deep trench capacitor, in order to save space on the
surface. Once a capacitor layout has been chosen, there is an
essential step of connecting the capacitor to the access
transistor. Conventionally, this is done with a conductive strap
which may be on the surface or may be buried. European Patent
Application 0 550 894 A1 from the assignee discloses a trench DRAM
cell array having a surface conductive strap. The size of the strap
and methods of forming it without introducing additional process
steps are key to economical production of DRAMs.The invention according to claim 1 relates to a method for making a self-aligned buried
strap trench capacitor DRAM cell, in which the strap is formed
without the need for an additional mask by using the step of
forming a shallow trench isolation to define the strap as well as
defining the isolation.Fig. 1 illustrates in cross-section a DRAM cell constructed
according to the invention. Figs. 2 - 5 illustrate in cross-section a portion of the DRAM
cell at various stages in the inventive method.Fig. 6 illustrates a top view of the DRAM cell.Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a portion of a DRAM
cell formed in substrate 10. A field-effect access transistor
denoted generally by the numeral 100 has a source 110 and a drain
112 controlled by gate 102 as is conventional. on the right of the
drawing, trench capacitor 50 is formed as is known in the art by
etching a deep trench down into the substrate 10, forming an
insulator along the trench surface (typically silicon dioxide
and/or silicon nitride), filling it with doped polysilicon 52 up to
a first level, then adding an insulating collar 54 of some
convenient dielectric such as silicon dioxide (oxide) or silicon
nitride (nitride).The center portion is then filled with a second layer of conductive
polysilicon 56. Strap 59 is shown at the top of electrode 56
connecting center electrode 56 to drain 112. An insulator 70 in the
form of oxide filling a shallow trench is shown to the right of the
transistor. The shallow trench isolation also extends behind and in
front of the plane of the paper in order to isolate the DRAM cell.Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown a preliminary step in
the formation of trench 50 after the deposition of lower
polysilicon 52 and the deposition of the collar oxide

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a DRAM cell having a trench capacitor in a
substrate (10) and an access transistor connected thereto

comprising the sequential steps of:

preparing said substrate (10);
forming a trench capacitor having a trench center electrode (56)
and a collar insulator (54) in said substrate adjoining an active

area of said substrate;
recessing said trench center electrode (56) to a buried strap
depth;
removing said collar insulator (54) to said buried strap depth;
depositing a layer of strap material (58) above said trench center
electrode (56), whereby said strap material contacts a portion of

said substrate below its surface,
etching a shallow trench having a shallow trench depth
greater than said buried strap depth in a trench isolation

area (70) close to said active area and partially overlapping said
trench capacitor along a first axis through said active area,

whereby a portion of said layer of strap material in said
trench isolation area (70) is removed and a strap (59), extending from

an edge of said active area over a portion of said trench
center electrode and formed from said strap material,

remains;
forming a transistor in said active area with an electrode (56)
extending to make electrical contact with said strap, whereby

said trench capacitor, strap (59) and transistor combine to form
said DRAM cell.
A method according to claim 1, in which said step of
depositing said layer of strap material (58) includes a step of removing

said strap material outside said trench capacitor and then
recessing said strap material below a reference surface above

said active region.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which said strap
material has a strap top surface below an active area top

surface; said shallow trench is filled with a dielectric material that
also covers said strap; and

said dielectric is planarized to be coplanar with said active
area top surface.
A method according to claim 1 or 3, in which said strap
material is conductive and in which said step of forming said

transistor includes implanting said active area after a
transistor gate is in place, whereby a conductive path is

formed from said transistor electrode through said strap to
said trench center electrode.
