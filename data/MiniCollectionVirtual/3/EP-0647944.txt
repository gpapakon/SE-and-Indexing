<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output circuit,
and more particularly to an output circuit for a memory
circuit having a binary signal as an input.In the semiconductor devices, there is known
a type, such as the so-called bytewide, which has a
plurality (sixteen, for example) of input and output
(I/O) terminals, wherein an I/O circuit is provided for
each of these plurality of I/O terminals. Referring to
FIG. 1, a conventional output circuit will be described.
In FIG. 1, only a specific circuit configuration of the
output circuit is illustrated, omitting the description
about the input circuit. An output circuit is constituted
by connecting in series N-channel transistors Tr1 and Tr2
between a power terminal Vcc and a ground terminal Vss.
A signal supplied to a first terminal OUT-A is applied
to the gate of the transistor Tr1 via an inverter 11 and
a bootstrap circuit 13, and a signal supplied to a second
terminal OUT-B is applied to the gate of the transistor
Tr2 via an inverter 12. An N-channel transistor Tr3 is
connected between the gate of the transistor Tr1 (node A) 
and the I/O terminal, with its gate connected to the
ground terminal Vss.A boosting signal Bt is applied to the bootstrap
circuit 13 to boost the potential of the node A to a value
higher than the power supply voltage Vcc. Accordingly,
it is possible to boost the potential of the node A, and
eventually raise the potential of the I/O terminal to
a high level exceeding Vcc, by supplying the boosting
signal Bt after the output of the I/O terminal raises
the potential Vcc - Vth (where Vth is the threshold
voltage of the transistor Tr1) through application of
a low level signal and a high level signal to OUT-A and
OUT-B, respectively.Then a high level signal and a low level signal are
applied to OUT-A and OUT-B, respectively, the I/O terminal
goes to a low level.To use the I/O terminal as an input terminal, the
output circuit is disabled by bringing both transistors
Tr1 and Tr2 to the off-state by applying high level
signals to OUT-A and OUT-B. The transistor Tr3 is
provided to cope with the so-called undershoot condition
in which the potential of the I/O terminal in this state
becomes lower than the ground potential. That is to say,
if the transistor Tr3 were absent, the potential of the
I/O terminal would become lower than the ground potential,
and the transistor Tr1 would be turned on when the absolute 
value of the potential exceeds the threshold voltage of
the transistor Tr1. At this time, the voltage between
the source and the
