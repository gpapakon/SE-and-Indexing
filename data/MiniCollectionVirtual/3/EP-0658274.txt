<ABSTRACT>
A miniature electric switch with two mutually contacting contact springs (2, 3) fitted in a plastic casing (1) is actuated by a switch lever (7) pivoted in the casing (1) having various switching profiles (8, 13) on its lever arm (2) in the casing (1), the first (8) of which bears on the rear of the first contact spring (2) and the second (13) on the front of the second contact spring (3).

<CLAIMS>
Miniaturized electric switch having two contact springs
(2, 3) that are arranged in a housing (1) made of

plastics and are to be brought in contact with each
other,


having a switch lever (7) being pivotable in the housing
(1), with a surface area (8) forming a first switching

contour, against which the first contact spring (2)
rests in resilient engagement,
and having a stop, against which the contacting side of
the second contact spring (3) rests in resilient

engagement,
characterized in that
 the stop is formed as a second
switching contour of the switch lever (7) at a further

surface area (13) thereof, and that either one (2) of
the contact springs (2, 3) has a cutout (14), through

which the switching contour (13) for the other contact
spring (3) passes, or one (2) of the contact springs (2,

3) is narrower than the other contact spring (3) at
least on part of its length and the switching contour

(13) for the wider contact spring (3) passes the narrow
contact spring (2) on both sides thereof.
Miniaturized electric switch according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 in contrast to the first switching
contour (8) the second switching contour (13) is a

sector of an annulus, which is arranged coaxially to the
pivot axis (6) of the switch lever (7). 
Miniaturized electric switch according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the shapes of the switching
contours (8, 13) are matched to each other, so that upon

pivoting of the switch lever (7) the contact springs (2,
3) will move in opposite directions.
Miniaturized electric switch according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the first
switching contour (8) defines a stable rest position

where the first contact spring (2) rests against it
along two lines or in flat engagement.
Arrangement in series of several miniaturized electric
switches according to any one of the preceding claims,

with the provision that several groups of pairs of
contact springs and switch levers are arranged in series

in a common housing, or that several housings along with
pairs of contact springs and switch levers situated

therein are connected in series with each other.
