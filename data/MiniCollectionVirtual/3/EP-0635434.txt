<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved pilfer-proof plastic cap comprising a 
cap body (1), a band member (2), and a plurality of stopper tabs (7) 

disposed 
inside of the band member. The inventive cap securely 

strengthens own pilfer-proof function by way of minimizing 
transit resistance of the stopper tabs on the way of climbing 

over a bead member (13) of a bottle mouth while securing the cap 
thereto and also by way of improving force of the stopper tabs to 

retain the band member. 
Structurally, an annular wall (5) upwardly opening itself is 
integrally formed with a band member inside of the band member. 

Aperture edge of the annular wall is inwardly bent in the radial 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic cap incorporating
pilfer-proof function.As is disclosed in US-A-4,550,844 for example, any of those
conventional plastic-molded pilfer-proof caps has a cap skirt and
a band member which are integrated by means of a plurality of
frangible bridges. More than 10 of stopper tabs are formed on
internal wall surface of the band member by way of projecting
themselves in the obliquely downward direction. When screwing
the cap skirt on bottle mouth, the stopper tabs come into contact
with a bead member outwardly expanding itself in the periphery of
the bottle mouth, and then reversely bend themselves in the
obliquely upward direction. Then, while maintaining bent
condition, the stopper tabs climb over the bead member before
eventually being engaged with the bottom surface thereof to
prevent the band member from being lifted while opening the
bottle. Each of the stopper tabs is thin at the bent end.
However, the nearer the projected end, the greater the thickness
of each stopper tab.Japanese Patent Publication No. HEI3-11985 (1991) discloses a
pilfer-proof cap. This prior art forms a plurality of stopper
tabs on internal wall surface of a band member in the state
projecting themselves in the obliquely upward direction. Like
the above example, the nearer the bent end, each of these stopper
tabs has thinner surface wall. This is because of the need to
minimize transit resistance while the stopper tabs respectively
climb over the bead member. Excessive transit resistance causes
bridges to easily be torn off while screwing the cap on the
bottle mouth.The applicant for a patent related to the present invention 
previously proposed a pilfer-proof cap via Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application Publication No. HEI1-182259 (1989), which
provides a plurality of stopper tabs projecting themselves from
bottom edge of a band member in the obliquely upward direction,
where surface wall of each stopper tab is bent in the chevron
shape in the sectional view.When introducing those stopper tabs each having surface wall
being thin at the refracted end and being thicker in the
direction of projected end, transit resistance of these stopper
tabs can be minimized when climbing over the bead member. On the
other hand, there is problem in terms of retentive force of the
band member while opening a bottle cap. Concretely, while the
band member is pulled in the upward direction relative to a
cap opening operation, refracted ends and projected tips of the
stopper tabs respectively bend downward. In

<CLAIMS>
A pilfer-proof plastic cap comprising;

an upper cap body (1);
a lower band member (2);
a plurality of bridges (3,3a);
an annular wall (5); and
a plurality of stopper tabs (7);

wherein said upper cap body (1) and said lower band
member (2) are integrally molded together by said

plurality of bridges (3,3a) interposed between said
cap body (1) and said lower band member (2); and

wherein said annular wall (5) extends upwardly and
inwardly from said lower band member (2) and is

integrally formed with said lower band member (2);
characterised in that said plurality of stopper tabs

(7) project inwardly from said annular wall (5) and
are formed by inwardly folding the aperture edge of

said annular wall (5) in the radial direction, so that
each of the stopper tabs (7) consist of a pair of

triangular surface walls (7a) defined by a ridge line
between the pair of walls (7a) and border lines

between each said surface wall (7a) and the annular
wall (5), said ridge line and border lines converging

at a base (6) where the annular wall (5) is connected to
the band member (2). 
The pilfer-proof cap according to Claim 1,
wherein said plurality of stopper tabs (7) are

respectively formed along the aperture edge of said
annular wall (5) in the manner of chevrons.
A pilfer-proof cap according to the Claim 1
wherein said plurality of stopper tabs (7) are

respectively formed in sawtoothed shape with one of
said triangular surface walls (7c), which is leading

in the cap-closing direction of rotation when screwing
sai
d cap to a bottle mouth, being mildly inclined, and
the other said triangular surface wall (7d) comprising

a short-length surface wall extending substantially in
the radial direction.
A pilfer-proof cap according to either of Claims
2 and 3, wherein the annular wall (5) has circular arc

domains (5a) between said stopper tabs (7).
A pilfer-proof cap according any of Claims 1 to
3, wherein said plurality of stopper tabs (7) are

provided continuously on said annular wall (5).
The pilfer-proof cap according to any preceding
claim, wherein said cap body (1) is linked with said

band member (2) via a plurality of frangible bridges
(3) each being relatively easily breakable and a

bridge (3a) which is relatively durable; wherein a 
breakable domain (10) is formed in said band member

(2) adjoining the location at which said durable
bridge (3a) is provided; and wherein said breakable

domain (10) and said plural frangible bridges (3) have
break strength less than that of said durable bridge

(3a).
