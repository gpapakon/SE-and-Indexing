<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is method and apparatus for fabrication, including 
populating, a low form factor printed circuit card. 
The printed circuit boards (23) are placed into a multi-board work 
holder (101) having a plurality of apertures (103) corresponding to the 

plurality of printed circuit boards (23). The multi-board work holder 
(103) is placed onto a surface mount technology line for reflow 

soldering integrated circuits to the boards (23). The x-y plane and 
z-axis coefficients of thermal expansion of the multi-board work holder 

(101) are matched to the x-y plane and z-axis coefficients of thermal 
expansion of the printed circuit boards (23) to avoid warpage and 

misalignment of the printed circuit boards (23). 
Further locking means for rigidly holding the printed circuit boards 
(23) in the multi-board work holder (101), and a method for attaching a 

relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion electrical connector 
interface (21) to a relatively coefficient of thermal expansion printed 

circuit board (23), are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to PCMCIA cards and more particularly
to the fabrication of PCMCIA cards. PCMCIA cards are
manufactured in a solder paste process where the printed
circuit board is heated to cure the solder paste carrier and
thereafter reflow the solder. This necessitates heating the
printed circuit board to at least the reflow temperature of
the solder. The reflow temperature of the solder is high
enough above ambient temperature to cause warpage of the card,
misalignment of the surface mount devices and the
circuitization, and, in severe cases, delamination of the
printed circuit board or card. The disclosed method and
apparatus avoid warpage, misalignment, and delamination of the
printed circuit board during reflow heating while using the
thermal expansion to aid in fabricating the printed circuit
cards."PCMCIA" stands for the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association. PCMCIA cards, element 1 in FIGURES
1, 2, 3, and 4, are the "credit card" peripherals used as
memory cards, including DRAM, SRAM, ROM, and PROM cards,
modem-fax cards, mini-hard drive cards, terminal emulator
cards, and the like. They are built to a PCMCIA standard. The
PCMCIA standard sets the electrical, mechanical, and interface
requirements for PCMCIA cards.The small size of PCMCIA cards is intended to meet the form
factor demands of portable computers. These small cards are
approximately the size of a plastic credit card ( 54.0 mm by
85.6 mm) but several times thicker (Type I PCMCIA cards are 
3.3 mm thick, Type II PCMCIA cards are 5 mm thick). It should
be noted that, as used herein, Type I and Type II refer to the
PCMCIA form and fit type standards, and not to the method of
surface mount device attachment. PCMCIA cards are described
in, for example, R.C. Alford, "Under The Hood: The PCMCIA
Redefines Portability", Byte Magazine, December 1992, pp. 237-242;
by Ken Ueltzen "Pushing The Packaging Envelope", Circuit
Assembly, March 1992, pp. 32-35, and Richard Nass, "IC-Card
Spec Adapts I/O To Memory Card Slot, "Electronic Design,
January 22, 1992, pp. 45-57.A PCMCIA card is shown in FIGURE 1, a partial cutaway view of
a PCMCIA card, with the top cover removed, is shown in FIGURE
