<ABSTRACT>
There is described a double-face circular knit (knitwear) comprising two concentric lengths of knit webs (1,1') and an in-between spacer structure, wherein the spacer threads (2) are optionally textured coarse-filament multifilament yarns, optionally in combination with monofilaments, the distance between the two lengths of knit web is from 0.3 to 8 mm, the stitch density corresponds to a machine gauge from E 16 to E 32, and the density of the spacer threads is between 150 and 250 threads per cm

A double-face circular knit comprising two concentric 
lengths of knit web (1) and (1') and an 

inbetween spacer structure (2), characterized in 
that the spacer structure (2) consists of spacer 

threads which comprise coarse-filament multifilament 
yarns, the distance between the two lengths of knit 

web (1) and (1') being from 0.3 to 8 mm and the 
stitch density corresponding to a machine gauge from 

E 16 to E 32, and in that the density of the spacer 
threads is between 150 and 250 threads per cm
2
. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 1, characterized 
in that coarse-filament multifilament yarns 

are textured. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the coarse-filament multifilament 

yarns have a yarn linear density from 50 to 
250 dtex and a filament linear density from 5 to 

100 dtex. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 1, characterized 
in that the spacer threads (2) additionally 

comprise monofilaments. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the monofilaments have a 

linear density from 20 to 150 dtex.  
 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that all the yarns 

for the double-face circular knit (1) and (1') 
consist of the same polymer. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 1, characterized 
in that the polymer of the yarns consists of 

polyesters or polyolefins. 
The double-face circular knit of claim 7, characterized 
in that the polyester is polyethylene 

terephthalate. 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 8, characterized in that its basis 

weight is from 150 to 1400 g/m
2
. 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the spacer 

threads of the spacer structure (2) are interlaced 
side by side in every row. 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the spacer 

threads of the spacer structure (2) alternate. 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 11, characterized in that from 50 to 80% 

by weight of the spacer threads are coarse-filament 
multifilament yarn and from 20 to 50% by weight are 

monofilaments. 
The double-face circular knit of at least one of 
claims 1 to 11, characterized in that from 60 to 70% 

by weight of the spacer threads are coarse-filament 
multifilament yarn and from 30 to 40% by weight are 

monofilaments. 
A process for producing the double-face circular  
 

knit of claim 1 by producing, on the two rows of 
needles of the cylinder and dial of a circular 

knitting machine with independently movable needles, 
a double-face circular knit in which the spacer 

threads (2) are guided alternatingly back and forth 
between the two lengths of knit web (1) and (1') and 

are interlaced or interlooped into each length of 
web, characterized in that it comprises feeding the 

needles of the corresponding knitting systems with 
spacer threads (2) comprising either coarse-filament 

multifilament yarns (4) or coarse-filament multifilament 
yarns (4) alternating with monofilaments 

(3). 
The process of claim 14, characterized in that the 
yarn supply is such that from 50 to 80% by weight of 

the spacer threads are coarse-filament multifilament 
yarn and from 20 to 50% by weight are monofilaments. 
The process of claim 14, characterized in that the 
yarn supply is such that from 60 to 70% by weight of 

the spacer threads are coarse-filament multifilament 
yarn and from 30 to 40% by weight are monofilaments. 
The process of claim 14, characterized in that the 

needles are controlled in such a way as to produce 
a plain structure in each of the lengths of web (1) 

and (1'). 
The use of the double-face circular knit of claim 1 
for upholstering and lining interior spaces.
