<ABSTRACT>
Weaving loom provided with a device for positioning 
at least one weft cutter relative to a sley 

in a specific direction, having a holder (1) and a 
bearing piece (30), which holder (1) is slidable in 

said bearing piece (30) wherein a multiple-rod system 
is provided for adjusting the slide of the sley, the 

multiple-rod system being coupled at its one end to 
the frame (17) by means of coupling elements, and 

being coupled at its other end to the slidable holder 
(1), and a hinged connection also being provided 

between said two ends of the multiple-rod system,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a weaving loom provided with a
device for positioning at least one weft cutter relative
to a sley.Known weaving looms are provided with a sley which, as
is known, carries out an oscillating movement along a
path describing a circular arc. When a weft cutter is
fixed directly on the sley of the weaving loom, said
weft cutter describes the same path as the sley itself,
in other words also in a circular arc. This means that
when the sley reaches the open position, the tips of the
weft cutters fixed directly thereon then lie just below
the grippers, for presentation of the severed weft to
the grippers.Document US-4875507 gives a good background as to dubbel
weft cutters moving together with the sley and which in
the beating-up position reach a position which is higher
than the level of the woven fabric edges.Moreover, during the next beating-up movement, in the
beating-up position of the reed, the weft cutter moves
into a position which is much too high relative to the
weft. The disadvantage of this is that the weft cutter
is no longer capable of intercepting and severing the
weft during said movement.The above can be overcome by providing additional guide
elements such as guide plates, said guide elements 
lifting up the weft together with the weft cutter.
However, the disadvantage of this is that it leads to
breakdowns, caused by the weft thread becoming stuck.
Another disadvantage of this is that it results in the
production of longer weft loss ends in the woven fabric,
and thus to material loss, and in some cases an
increasing risk of manufacturing faults in the woven
fabric.In document EP-0104440, there is shown how the weft
threads are pushed up by guide plates so as to be
intercepted by the weft cutters standing higher on the
sley.In FR-A-1571926 there is recited a weaving loom provided
with a device for positioning at least one weft cutter
relative to the sley having a holder for carrying said
weft cutter and a bearing piece for accommodating the
holder.The object of the invention is to provide a solution to
the abovementioned problems. To this end, there is
provided according to the invention a weaving loom as
defined in Claim 1 whereby the holder is slidably
mounted inside the bearing piece so that it slides in a
specific direction, thereby allowing the weft cutter to
carry out an upward and downward movement.According to an advantageous embodiment of the
invention, the bearing piece comprises a body and a
tubular guide element connected immovably thereto, said
body

<CLAIMS>
Weaving loom provided with a device for positioning
at least one weft cutter relative to a sley of a weaving

loom in a specific direction, having a holder (1) for
carrying said at least one weft cutter (11, 12) and a

bearing piece (30) for accommodating the holder (1),
which bearing piece is fixed immovably on the sley,

which has at least one sley leg (5), a first end of
which is rotatably connected to the sley by means of

coupling elements, characterised in that the holder (1)
is slidably mounted inside the bearing piece (30) so

that it slides in a specific direction (F).
Weaving loom according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the bearing piece (30) comprises a body (31) and a

tubular guide element (32) connected immovably thereto,
said body forming the part which is fixed immovably to

the sley, and in that the holder (1) comprises a further
body (18) and a projecting part (19) which is connected

immovably thereto and is provided for sliding inside
said guide element (32), the sliding direction (F) being

at right angles to the lengthwise direction of the sley
(9).
Weaving loom according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that a multiple-rod system is provided

for adjusting the slide of the holder (1) in the bearing
piece (30) while driving the movement of the sley, the

multiple-rod system being coupled at its one end to a
frame (17) by means of further coupling elements, and

being coupled at its other end to the slidable holder
(1), and a hinged connection also being provided between

said two ends of the multiple-rod system, said 
connection pivoting about a coupling shaft (4) which is

supported on bearings in said at least one sley leg (5).
Weaving loom according to Claim 3, characterised in
that said multiple-rod system consists of a four-rod

mechanism containing a double pair (2, 3; 6, 7), each
pair (2,3) and (6,7) respectively having a connecting

point in said coupling shaft (4), in which a respective
lever (3; 6) engages and forms the connection with a

respective drive rod (2; 7), which drive rods
respectively engage in said two ends of the multiple-rod

system.
Weaving loom according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that said holder (1) and said bearing piece (30) form a

slide pair, and in that said bearing piece (30)
has a certain inclination.
Weaving loom according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that said holder (1) and said bearing piece (30) form a
