<ABSTRACT>
Secured to the inside of an upper plate (1) is a storage member (15) which contains an operation plate (19) 
provided with an engagement (21) and springs. An intermediate plate (16) and a rammer (6) are mounted to an end of 

the upper plate (1), and a lower plate (18) having a band mounting portion and an engaging projection (23) is mounted 
to an end of the intermediate plate (16). A first band member having an adjustment hole is inserted into a gap between 

the upper plate (1) and the storage member (15) such that the rammer (6) is inserted into the adjustment hole for an 
adjustment of a length and engagement. In addition, a second band member is mounted to the band mounting portion 

to constitute the band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a buckle for watch
bands. More specifically, the invention relates to a buckle
according to the preamble of claim 1.Fig. 10 shows a perspective view of a conventional
buckle
connected to one of the watch bands 10. It
comprises a frame 20 and a tongue 40. An end of the
other band 30 is inserted into the frame 20 from the
underside of the buckle. The band 30 is pulled in the
reverse direction at the frame 20. The tongue 40 is
engaged with one of adjusting holes 30a of the band 30
at a desired length. Thus, the length of the band is
easily adjustable and the band is worn in good feeling.However, in such a conventional buckle, the band
must be attentively inserted in the frame of the buckle
from the underside thereof. Otherwise, the buckle may
disengage, and the watch may drop. Furthermore, the
frame and the tongue rub the surface of the band,
causing it to hurt and the life of the band to shorten.Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-open No.
3-127519 discloses a buckle which may eliminate the
above mentioned defects. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12,
the buckle comprises a rectangular frame 31 in which a 
first band 42 having a plurality of engaging holes 44 is
inserted, a middle plate 46 rotatably connected to an
end of the frame, and a bottom plate 48 rotatably
connected to the middle plate and a second band 50. The
frame 31 has an inner space approximately equal to the
thickness of the first band 42. An end of the middle
plate 46 is connected to a connecting portion 34 secured
to the underside of the frame 31 with a pin 32. A
tongue 36 is fixed to the pin 32 to be rotatably
supported by the connecting portion 34, and engaged with
one of the engaging holes 44 of the first band 42. The
middle plate 46 further has an engaging recess 46a to be
engaged with an engaging portion 56 provided on the
bottom plate 48. The second band 50 is connected to an
end of the bottom plate 48 through a connecting link 52.In order to use the buckle, the first band 42 is
inserted into the frame 31 and the tongue 36 is rotated
and inserted into one of the holes 44 of the band at a
preferable length so that the band 42 is secured in the
frame 31. The frame 31 is pressed against the bottom
plate 48 so that the recess 46a of the middle plate 46
engages with the engaging portion 56 of the bottom plate
48. If a tension is exerted on the band 42 for
expanding the band, the tongue 36 is abutted on a side
46b of the middle plate 46, thereby preventing the band
from expanding. In order to disengage the

<CLAIMS>
A buckle for watch bands having a first band member (8) having a plurality of
adjusting holes and a second band member (9), the buckle having a longitudinal

first end side and a longitudinal second end side, and including a cover (1) having
opposite side plates (11), a middle plate (5;16;26) rotatably connected to said

cover (1) at a longitudinal first end thereof by a pin (12), and a bottom plate

(7;18;27) rotatably connected to a second end of said middle plate (5;16;26) at a
longitudinal end(s) thereof, by a pin (13),
characterized in that
the cover (1) is rotatably connected to the middle plate (5;16;26) at a longitudinal
first end of the first end side, and has opposite openings (1a) formed in the side

plates (11) at a longitudinal second end which is located at an inner side toward
the second end side of the buckle;
a tongue (6) is rotatably mounted on the first end of the cover (1) by the pin (12)
to be engaged with one of the adjusting holes of the first band member (8);
a guide housing (4;15) is disposed in an inside of said cover at a position
corresponding to the openings (1a);
a space is formed between an upper plate of the guide housing (4) and an inside
wall of the cover (1) in which the first band member (8) is inserted and supported;
a pair of push plates (2;19) are slidably mounted in said guide housing (4) so as
to be slid in the lateral direction with respect to the longitudinal direction of the

bands;
a spring (3;22) is provided between the push plates (2;19) for outwardly urging
the push plates respectively;
stopping means (4c) is provided for stopping each of the push plates at a position
where an outer end portion (2b) of the push plate is projected from said openings (1a) of

the side plate (11) of the cover so as to be operated by a finger of a wearer;
each push plate has an engaging projection (2a, 21) and a slant (2e, 21a) formed
