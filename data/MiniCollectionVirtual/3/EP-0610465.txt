<ABSTRACT>
In a securing device there are a metal plug (1) and a screw (2). One end of the plug has longitudinal slots (3) to form an expansion region (S). To prevent the metal plug (1) from turning in the drilling, it has a conical broadened region (8) so that the metal plug fits tightly against the wall of the drilling. The pressure of the expansion region is produced by making no thread in the transition aperture and providing the radial load by the shape or cut of the thread.

<CLAIMS>
A fastening element for use in concrete or similar 
material, comprising a metal dowel (1) which at one free end 

is provided with a plurality of longitudinal slots (3) to 
form an expanding region (S) and comprising sector-like 

portions (7), and at the screwing-in end has an unslotted 
region (U) which has a threadless bore (4), and also a screw 

which can be screwed into the metal dowel (1), characterised 
in that the
 metal dowel (1) consists of steel, aluminium or 
similar hard metal and has a threadless bore (4) extending 

over its entire length, and in that to generate the force 
required to expand the free end the screw (2) is provided at 

its screwing-in end with a thread-forming shank portion (5) 
and is cylindrical substantially along its entire shank 

length or is of constant trilobular cross-sectional shape. 
A fastening element according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the metal dowel (1) and the screw (2) are 

preassembled by screwing in the screw (2) so as to form a 
thread. 
A fastening element according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the bore (4) in the metal dowel (1) 

has, at its end nearest the screw (2) to be screwed in, a 
widened portion (6) of larger diameter corresponding at 

least to the thread outer diameter. 
A fastening element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the metal dowel (1) has two 

intersecting, radially continuous slots (3). 
A fastening element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the unslotted region of the  

 
metal dowel (1) is provided externally with means for 

preventing relative rotation. 
A fastening element according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the means for preventing relative rotation of the 

metal dowel (1) comprises a conical widening (8) thereof or 
grooves, ribs or knurling. 
A fastening element according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that at its end nearest the screw (2) 

to be screwed in the metal dowel (1) has a stop flange of 
larger diameter. 
A fastening element according to Claims 3 and 6, 
characterised in that the length (L) of the widened portion 

(6) of the bore (4) is the same or smaller than the length 
(E) of the means for preventing relative rotation provided 

externally on the metal dowel (1).
