<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microcrystalline
series photovoltaic element having a high
photoelectric conversion efficiency and which enables
one to produce a high performance semiconductor device,
representatively such as a high performance solar cell,
a high performance photosensor, or the like, where
particularly said solar cell stably exhibits solar cell
characteristics without being deteriorated even when
continuously used outdoors over a long period of time. The
present invention also relates a process for producing
said photovoltaic element. The present invention further
relates to a building material in which said photovoltaic
element is used and a sunlight power generation apparatus
in which said photovoltaic element is used. Various photovoltaic elements have been using not
only as independent power sources of electrical equipments
but also as alternate energy sources of daily power
supply systems. However, for the photovoltaic elements
used as alternate energy sources of daily power supply
systems, they are still unsatisfactory particularly in
terms of their cost per a unit quantity of generated power.
In this connection, various Studies have been conducting in
order to develop improved photovoltaic elements. For
instance, particularly with respect to the materials
which play the most important role in photoelectric
conversion, technical research and development of
crystalline type photovoltaic elements, thin film type
photovoltaic elements, and the like have been carrying
out. The crystalline type photovoltaic element is meant
a photovoltaic element having a photoelectric conversion
member comprising a single crystalline silicon
semiconductor material or a polycrystalline silicon
semiconductor material. The thin film type
photovoltaic element is meant a photovoltaic element
having a photoelectric conversion member comprising an
amorphous silicon-containing semiconductor material such
as an amorphous silicon semiconductor material and an
amorphous silicon-germanium semiconductor material; a 
microcrystalline silicon-containing semiconductor
material such as a microcrystalline silicon semiconductor
material and a microcrystalline silicon-germanium
semiconductor material; an amorphous or microcrystalline
silicon carbide semiconductor material; or a compound
semiconductor material. For such microcrystalline
silicon-containing semiconductor material, although
various studies have been made, its reduction to practical
use has not progressed as in the case of the
crystalline or amorphous
