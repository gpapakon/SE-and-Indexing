<DESCRIPTION>
 TETRALIN DERIVATIVES AS HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORSTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to novel tetralin derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are useful as a medicament.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel tetralin derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which have inhibitory activity against an enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), to a process for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition containing the same, to a use of the same as a medicament, and to a method for treating hypercholesterolaemic and hyperlipoproteinaemic states and associated conditions.Accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide the tetralin derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and therefore are capable of lowering blood serum cholesterol levels and blood lipid levels.Another object of this invention is to provide a process for production of the tetralin derivatives and salts thereof.A further object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing, as an active ingredient, tetralin derivatives and salts thereof.Still further object of this invention is to provide a use of the tetralin derivatives and salts thereof as a medicament and a method for treating hypercholesterolaemic states, hyperlipoproteinaemic states and associated conditions in human beings or animals. 

 High levels of blood cholesterol and blood lipids are conditions which are involved in the onset of arteriosclerosis. It is well known that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are effective in lowering the level of blood plasma cholesterol, especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It has now been established that lowering LDL- C levels affords protection from coronary heart disease.The tetralin derivatives and salts thereof inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and so inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. They lower concentrations of cholesterol in blood. Thus they are useful for treating hypercholesterolaemic and hyperlipoproteinaemic states (e. g. atherosclerosis) and associated conditions (e. g. angina, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion, arterial aneurism, peripheral vascular disease, recurrent pancreatitis and xanthomas).The tetralin derivatives can be represented by the following general formula (I).in which R^ is hydrogen or acetyl, R2 is carboxy and R is hydroxy, or R2 and Rg may form lactone.Among the tetralin derivatives
