<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording
apparatus and method which perform various controls using a presumed
head temperature, more particularly, to ink jet
recording apparatus and method in which stabilization of ink
ejection and detection of ejection failure are effected by use
of a presumed head temperature.Recording apparatus such as printers, copying
machines and facsimile terminal equipment are
constructed to record images consisting of dot-patterns
onto recording materials such as plastic sheet.Recording apparatus can be classified into various types such as
ink-jet, wire-dot, thermal, laser-beam etc.,
according to the recording method used.An ink-jet printer (ink-jet recording apparatus)
is constructed to supply ink drops from an orifice or outlet
of the recording head onto the recording
material.Recently, a large number of recording apparatus
have been used, and high-speed recording, high resolution,
high-quality image low noise are required for these
recording apparatus. The ink-jet recording 
apparatus can satisfy
these requirements. As this ink-jet recording
apparatus ejects ink from the recording head, the
stabilization of both ink ejection and the amount of ejected ink
that is required to fulfill the above requirements is
greatly influenced by the ink temperature at the ink
ejection orifice. If the ink temperature is too low,
the viscosity of the ink will increase abnormally and
the ink, will not be ejected by the normal ejection energy; if
the temperature is too high, the ejected ink quantity
will increase and the ink will overflow on the
recording paper, leading to deterioration of the
print quality.Therefore, in previous ink-Jet recording
apparatus a method of controlling the ink temperature
at the ejection opening to be within a desired range using a
temperature sensor mounted on the recording head, or a
method of controlling ink ejection recovery have been used.
A heating element mounted on the recording head is used for said
temperature control where the ink-jet recording apparatus is arranged
to eject ink by using heat energy, i.e. in apparatus that ejects ink
drops by bubble generation by ink film boiling, the ejection heater
Itself may be sometimes used for this purpose. To use the ejection
heater as a temperature control heater the ejection heater must be
supplied with electric current such that no bubble generation occurs. In 
recording apparatus in which ink drops are ejected by
generating bubbles in solid or liquid ink by means of heat
energy the ejection
