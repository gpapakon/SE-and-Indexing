<ABSTRACT>
There is described an industrial robot with a new 
configuration including an arm (10) rotatably mounted 

around a first vertical axis (1) on a fixed body (71), 
a second body (72) rotatably mounted around a second 

vertical axis (2) below said arm (10), a parallelogram 
linkage (75) rotatably mounted around a third 

horizontal axis (3) on the second body (72) and a wrist 
(80) carried by the parallelogram linkage (75) and 

articulated around two mutually orthogonal axes (4, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to industrial robots, 
of the type indicated in the pre-characterizing portion of the 
annexed Claim. A robot of this type is disclosed in WO-A-9 313 915. The object of the present invention is that of 
providing an industrial robot of the type indicated 
above, which is particularly, but not exclusively, to 
be produced as a robot of small size for carrying out 
e.g. arc-welding operations or for handling relatively 
light articles, which has a structure very simple and 
constituted by a reduced number of parts and which can 
be assembled with easy and rapid operations. In order to achieve this object, the invention 
provides an industrial robot as set forth in the annexed Claim. Further features and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the following description  
 
with reference to the annexed drawings, given purely by 
way of non limiting example, in which: 
figures 1, 2 are a side view and a plan view of a 
preferred embodiment of the robot according to the 
invention. With reference to these figures, the robot, 
generally designated by reference 70, comprises a fixed 
body 71 which rotatably supports around a vertical axis 
1 an arm 10 carrying two electric motors 39, 51 with 
associated reduction gear units at its ends. The arm 10 
rotatably supports around a vertical axis 2 a body 72 
mounted below the arm 10. The two motors 39, 51 drive 
the rotation around axes 1, 2. Preferably, the 
reduction gear units associated therewith are 
integrated in the structure of arm 10, i.e. this 
structure acts directly as a casing of the gear 
reduction transmission, according to what is indicated 
in a copending application of the same applicant. The 
rotating body 72 rotatably supports around an axis 3 a 
lever 73 forming, along with a further lever 74, a 
parallelogram linkage 75. Lever 74 is articulated to 
body 72 around an axis 76 parallel to axis 3. The two 
levers 73, 74 are articulated at 77 and 78 to an arm 
carrying a wrist 80 comprising a first body 81, a 
second body 82 rotatably mounted below body 81 around a 
vertical axis 4 and a flange 83 rotatably mounted onto 
body 82 around an horizontal axis 5. Due to the above described structure, the robot 
according to the invention may reach any point in an 
extended area whose outline is diagrammatically 
indicated by A in figure 1. At the same time, the 
structure of the robot is simple and inexpensive. The 
robot is very flexible in operation and may move at 
very high speeds.

<CLAIMS>
Industrial robot, comprising a plurality of elements 
(71, 10, 72, 81, 82) articulated to each other around 

respective articulation axes (1-5) and provided with a 
plurality of electric motors (39, 51, 72a, 80a, 80b) 

for driving rotation of each articulated element of the 
robot around the respective articulation axes (1-5) and 

a reduction gear unit interposed in the connection 
between each electric motor and the respective driven 

element, said robot comprising a 
fixed body (71), an arm (10) rotatably mounted around a 

first axis (1) on said fixed body (71), a 
second body (72) rotatably mounted around a second axis 

(2), which is vertical, below the arm (10), a 
parallelogram linkage (75) rotatably mounted around a 

third horizontal axis (3) on said second body (72) and 
a wrist (80) carried by said parallelogram linkage (75) 

and including a first element (81) carried by the 
parallelogram linkage, and a second element (82) rotatably 

mounted on the first element (81) around a fourth axis (4), 
characterized in that said first axis (1) 

of articulation of said arm (10) to said fixed 
body (71) is vertical, so that said arm (10) 

is able to move in a horizontal plane, 
in that said second body (72) is rotatably 

supported around said second vertical axis (2) 
by the structure of said arm (10), and 

in that said wrist (80) further includes  
 

a flange (83) rotatable on the second element 
(82) around an axis (5) orthogonal to said fourth axis 

(4).
