<ABSTRACT>
A vapor of diethylzinc or dimethylzinc is reacted 
with water vapor to form very small particles of depleted 

zinc oxide which are entrained in the gas flow. In 
accordance with one version of the method, a spray nozzle 

is used to mix liquid diethylzinc with dry nitrogen 
to prevent combustion. The nozzle sprays the diluted 

diethylzinc into a chamber heated up to its boiling 
point of 118°C to completely vaporize the diethylzinc. 

The diluted diethylzinc gas is then reacted with water 
vapor to form a fume of very small zinc oxide particles 

entrained in ethane gas without combustion. A similar 
process can be used to convert dimethylzinc into depleted 

zinc oxide powder. In accordance with another 
version of the process, an inert gas stream is saturated 

with diethylzinc or dimethylzinc vapor by passing a dry 
inert gas through a vessel containing liquid diethylzinc 

or dimethylzinc. A second inert gas stream is saturated 
with water vapor in a similar manner. These two gas 

streams will chemically react to form a fume of very 
small zinc oxide particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the operation 
and safety of water-cooled nuclear reactors. In particular, 
the invention relates to methods for minimizing 
the risk of exposure of workers to radioactive emissions 
during reactor shutdown for refueling and/or maintenance. A major hazard in water-cooled nuclear reactors is 
the accumulation of radioactive substances in the structural 
portions of the reactor. The buildup of radioactive 
nuclides occurs on the inner surfaces of components 
which are in contact with the reactor water. This 
includes both the primary recirculation circuit and the 
reactor water cleanup system. During reactor shutdown, workers are exposed to 
radiation emanating from stainless steel internal walls 
and inner surfaces of piping. Radioactive materials 
retained in oxide films which have accumulated on wall 
and piping surfaces are a major source of radiation exposure. 
The radioactivity has been found to be predominantly 
due to the Co-60 isotope. As a result, a substantial 
effort has been made to identify the key 
parameters which affect Co-60 buildup and to determine 
and implement methods for limiting that buildup. The radiation buildup, controlled mainly by the Co-60 
isotope concentration, occurs by two processes. 
First, the Co-60 which is dissolved in the reactor water  
 
incorporates into the crystalline structure of the oxide 
film as the latter is formed on the stainless steel 
surfaces. Second, the Co-60 isotope sorbs onto the 
surfaces of particulates floating in the reactor water 
or on the fuel. Particles which contain sorbed Co-60 
tend to deposit in regions of relatively low water flow 
velocity. This leads to regions of higher radioactivity 
which are commonly referred to as "hot spots". The use of very dilute (trace) concentrations of 
zinc oxide in the reactor water has been demonstrated, 
both in the laboratory and in boiling water reactors, 
to limit the incorporation of Co-60 into the oxide film. 
Zinc oxide is also used in the cooling water of some 
nuclear reactors to inhibit intergranular stress corrosion 
cracking of pipes and internal reactor parts. In 
some nuclear reactors a slurry of zinc oxide is injected 
into the reactor feedwater. In other plants a passive 
system is used where a portion of the reactor feedwater 
flows through a tank containing zinc oxide pellets. 
Either process requires a zinc oxide powder of small 
particle size that is either made into a slurry with 
water or pressed and sintered into pellets. Naturally occurring
