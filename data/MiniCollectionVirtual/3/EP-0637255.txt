<ABSTRACT>
An injection cartridge of the dual-chamber type and containing a solid product in a front chamber and a liquid product in a rear chamber further contains in the front chamber a medium which is soluble in the liquid product, and which preferably is a soluble gas. By this arrangement, the formation of gas bubbles is minimized when the solid and liquid products are mixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of injection
cartridges, and more specifically to injection
cartridges of the dual-chamber type. The invention also
relates to a method for manufacturing such injection
cartridges.In the field of hypodermic injections, injection
cartridges have found a wide use. Such cartridges are
provided pre-filled with a liquid composition to be
injected and are usually provided with a movable
piston-like wall at one end and a wall which can
readily be pierced by an injection needle or cannula at
the other end. When an injection is to be administered,
the user inserts the cartridge into the barrel of a
syringe adapted to receive the cartridge, and a liquid
connection with the contents of the cartridge is
established by an injection needle through the afore-mentioned
piercable wall. By applying pressure on the
other, movable wall, the liquid is then forced out
through the needle and may be administered to a
patient.Such injection cartridges have a number of important
advantages. As they are supplied to the user in a pre-filled
state, there is no need to fill the syringe by
drawing liquid up through the needle from a storage
bottle containing the composition to be injected. This
of course gives a much improved security against contamination
from bacteria and small particles which may be
released when the closure of the storage bottle is
pierced. Furthermore, by the use of suitable injection
devices, the injection from cartridges can be simplified
so much that the patient can carry out the injection
on himself. This is of great importance, for
example to persons suffering from diabetes, who have to
take frequent injections of insuling.A further development of the injection cartridges has
been the dual-chamber cartridges
see for instance document EP-A-0298067.
Such cartridges are
used when the substance to be injected is not stable in 
solution, but has to be stored in the form of a dry
powder, which is dissolved or dispersed in a liquid
phase immediately before administering to a patient.
Such cartridges have a movable, piston-like wall at one
end and a piercable wall at the other end like those
cartridges described in the foregoing, but are additionally
provided with a second movable, piston-like
wall inside the barrel of the cartridge between its two
ends, and also with a bypass channel, which is usually
arranged in the wall of the cartridge. Thus, the second
movable wall divides the cartridge internally into two
chambers one of which containing the dry injection
substance
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An injection cartridge of the dual-chamber type, comprising a front chamber which
contains a solid product, and a rear chamber which contains a liquid product, said front and

rear chambers being separated by a fluid-sealing movable wall, and a bypass channel for
conducting the liquid product from said rear chamber into said front rear chamber, to be

mixed with the solid product to form a preparation to be injected, characterized in that the
solid product in the front chamber is surrounded by a medium which is soluble in the liquid

product and which is used to replace the air in the space of the front chamber.
An injection cartridge according to claim 1, characterized in that the liquid product
is water or an aqueous liquid.
An injection cartridge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the medium
surrounding the solid product is a gas which is soluble in the liquid product.
An injection cartridge according to claim 3, characterized in that the medium is
carbon dioxide.
An injection cartridge according to claim 3, characterized in that the medium is
ammonia.
An injection cartridge according to any one of claims 1-5, characterized in that the
medium is able to form an essentially homogenous phase with the liquid.
An injection cartridge according to any one of claims 1-6, characterized in that it is
provided with means to maintain a substantially constant pressure in the front chamber.
An injection cartridge according to claim 7, characterized in that a further, fluid-sealing
movable wall is arranged in the front chamber immediately in front of the solid

product.
An injection cartridge according to claim 7, characterized in that said front
chamber is provided with outlet means for the outflow of the medium when the liquid is

mixed with the solid product.
A method for the manufacture of an injection cartridge according to any one of
claims 1-9, characterized in that when a front chamber of the cartridge is filled with the

solid product, said product is surrounded by a medium which is used to replace the air in the
space of the front chamber and

which is soluble in a liquid product which is filled in the rear chamber of the cartridge.
A method according to claim 10, characterized in that said medium is a gas which
is soluble in said liquid product. 
A method according to claim 11, characterized in that said solid product is
prepared by freeze-drying a solution of the solid product directly in said front chamber of

the cartridge, and introduction of said soluble gas into the front chamber after the freeze-drying.
