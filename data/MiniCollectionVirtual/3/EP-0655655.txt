<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
photosensitive member, and more particularly, to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member having a
photosensitive layer in which a disazo pigment having a
specific structure is present. The present invention also
pertains to a process cartridge and an electrophotographic
apparatus which employ such an electrophotographic
photosensitive member.Electrophotographic photosensitive members employing
organic photoconductive substances have advantages in that
productivity is extremely high, that they are relatively
inexpensive, and that color sensitivity thereof can be
desirably controlled by adequately selecting the pigment or
dye used. Therefore, research has heretofore been conducted
on electrophotographic photosensitive members. The function
separation type photosensitive member has been developed in 
which a charge generating layer containing an organic
photoconductive substance, such as an organic photoconductive
dye or pigment, and a charge transporting layer containing a
charge transporting substance, such as a photoconductive
polymer or a low-molecular organic photoconductive substance,
are disposed as a laminate. Accordingly, the sensitivity and
durability of the conventional organic photoelectric
photosensitive members have thus been improved greatly.Among organic photoconductive substances, azo pigments
in general exhibit excellent photoconductivity. Furthermore,
compounds exhibiting desired characteristics can be produced
relatively easily by combining amine components with coupler
components. Therefore, various types of compounds have
heretofore been proposed in, for example, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. Sho 54-22834, Sho 58-177955, Sho 58-194035,
Sho 61-215556, Sho 61-241763, Sho 63-17456, Sho 63-259572 and
Sho 63-259670.In recent years, there have been demands for a higher
image quality and a higher durability. To meet these
demands, electrophotographic photosensitive members having
higher sensitivity and exhibiting more excellent
electrophotographic characteristics when used repetitively
have been desired.An object of the present invention is to provide an
electrophotographic member having a high sensitivity.
Another object of the present invention is to provide an
electrophotographic photosensitive member which maintains
stable and excellent potential characteristics even when it
is used repetitively.Still another object of the present invention is to
provide a process cartridge and an electrophotographic
photosensitive apparatus
