<ABSTRACT>
Laser-imageable flexographic printing plates and a 
method of making same are disclosed. A thin polymeric film 

doped with a UV absorber is laminated to a photopolymer 
layer. The film is ablated from the photopolymer using a 

laser operating at a selected wavelength to create an in 
situ negative. The resulting negative can be subjected to 

typical UV flood exposure and development.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printing plates which
can be made without using a negative. More
specifically, it relates to a laser-imageable printing
plate. Such plates are particularly useful for
flexographic printing, but can be used for offset and
lithographic printing.Flexography is a method of printing that is
commonly used for high-volume runs. Flexography is
employed for printing on a variety of substrates such
as paper, paperboard stock, corrugated board, films,
foils and laminates. Newspapers and grocery bags are
prominent examples. Coarse surfaces and stretch films
can be economically printed only by means of
flexography. Flexographic printing plates are relief
plates with image elements raised above open areas.
One type of flexographic printing plate resembles a
transparent or translucent plastic doormat when it is
ready for use. The plate is somewhat soft, and
flexible enough to wrap around a printing cylinder,
and durable enough to print over a million copies.Such plates offer a number of advantages to the
printer, based chiefly on their durability and the
ease with which they can be made. Further
improvements, to the degree of resolution (fineness of
detail) which can be obtained as well as reductions in
cost, would expand the usefulness of these plates.
The present invention allows both increased resolution
by use of laser processing, and reductions in cost 
through the elimination of the use of a negative to
make the printing plate.A typical flexographic printing plate as
delivered by its manufacturer is a multilayered
article made of a backing, an unexposed photocurable
layer, a protective layer or slip film, and a cover
sheet. The backing lends support to the plate. It is
typically a plastic sheet about 127µm (5 mils) or so thick,
which may be transparent or opaque. The photocurable
layer may be anywhere from about 635-6985 µm (25-275 mils)thick,
and can be formulated from any of a wide variety of
known photopolymers, initiators, reactive diluents,
fillers, etc. The slip film is a thin (about 2,54-25,4 µm (0.1 -
1.0 mils)) sheet which is transparent to UV light that
protects the photopolymer from dust and increases its
ease of handling. The cover sheet is a heavy,
protective layer, typically polyester, plastic or
paper.In normal use, the printer will peel the cover
sheet off the printing plate, and place a negative on
top of the slip film. The plate and negative will
then be subjected to flood-exposure by UV light
through the negative. The areas exposed to the light
cure, or harden, and

A laser-imageable printing plate comprising:

a) a backing layer;
b) a photocurable layer thereon;
c) an ultra-violet radiation absorbing slip layer thereon,
characterized in that
 the photocurable layer has a low absorbance
of radiation at a selected wavelength in the range

of 300 to 400 nm and contains an initiator activatable at
the selected wavelength, and that the absorbing layer comprises

a UV-transparent polymeric matrix and a UV-absorber
selected from the group consiting of benzophenone derivatives,

benzotriazole, and 4-phenylazophenol having a high

providing a solid, uncured printing plate comprising:

a) a backing layer;
b) a photocurable layer thereon;
c) an ultra-violet radiation absorbing slip layer

ablating the polymeric matrix using a laser, thereby
providing ablated and unablated areas;
exposing the printing plate to UV light; thereby curing
