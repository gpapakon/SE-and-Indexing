<ABSTRACT>
A turbine nozzle assembly comprises an annular array of 
nozzle guide vanes (24) located downstream of a combustor 

discharge casing (40). Each nozzle guide vane (24) 
comprises an aerofoil portion (25) which is cast 

integrally with a radially inner platform (26) and a 
radially outer platform (30). The radially outer platform 

(30) of each nozzle guide vane (24) has an extension (34) 
to provide a smooth transition of the gases from the 

combustor discharge casing (40) to the nozzle guide vanes 
(24). Two rows of cooling holes (38) are provided in the 

extension (34) to film cool inner surface (31) of the 
platform (30). A method is described to calculate the 

diameter of each of the cooling holes (38) so that a 
uniform flow of cooling air passes over the inner surface 

(31) of the platform (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turbine nozzle 
assembly and in particular to a turbine nozzle assembly 
for a gas turbine engine as described in the preamble of claim 1. Such an assembly is shown in GB-A-2 107 405. A conventional axial flow gas turbine engine 
comprises, in axial flow series, a compressor section, a 
combustor in which compressed air from the high pressure 
compressor is mixed with fuel and burnt and a turbine 
section driven by the products of combustion. The products of combustion pass from the combustor 
to the first stage of the turbine through an array of 
nozzle guide vanes. Aerodynamic losses are experienced as 
the products of combustion pass from the combustor to the 
nozzle guide vanes. The aerodynamic losses produce a 
circumferential pressure gradient close to the leading 
edge of the nozzle guide vane. This pressure gradient 
prevents cooling air from flowing uniformly over the 
platform of the nozzle guide vane. As the cooling air 
does not flow uniformly over the platform hot combustion 
gases can impinge on the platform surface and cause hot 
streaks on the platform of the nozzle guide vane. This is 
detrimental to component performance and life. The present invention seeks to provide a turbine 
nozzle assembly in which the nozzle guide vanes have 
platforms which provide a smoother transition of the 
combustion products from the combustor to the nozzle 
guide vanes. The present invention also seeks to provide 
improved cooling of the platforms of the nozzle guide 
vanes to substantially minimise the damage caused by hot 
streaks on the platform surfaces. According to the present invention a turbine nozzle 
assembly for a gas turbine engine comprises an annular 
array of nozzle guide vanes and combustor discharge 
means, the annular array of nozzle guide vanes being 
located downstream of the combustor discharge means, each  
 
nozzle guide vane comprising an aerofoil member 
respectively attached by its radial extents to a radially 
inner and a radially outer platform, the platforms of the 
nozzle guide vanes defining gas passage means for gases 
from the combustor discharge means, at least one of the 
platforms of the nozzle guide vanes having an upstream 
portion which extends towards the combustor discharge 
means to provide a smooth transition of the gases from 
the combustor discharge means to the nozzle guide vanes, 
the upstream portions of the platforms of the nozzle 
guide vanes having an at least one row of cooling holes 
therein through which in operation
