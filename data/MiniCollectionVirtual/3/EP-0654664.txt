<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to ion selective agents 
useful in preparing membranes for ion selective 
electrodes, and more particularly, monensin amide 
derivatives which are useful as sodium-selective agents 
in sodium-selective membranes for sodium ion selective 
electrodes. Electrochemical measurements are widely used to 
determine the concentration of specific substances in 
fluids. These devices, referred to as ion-selective 
electrodes (ISEs), can be employed in a wide variety of 
potentiometric ion determinations, including, for 
example, the activity of fluoride ion in drinking water, 
the pH of process streams, and the determination of 
electrolytes in blood serum. In the health care field, and, in particularly, in 
the area of clinical diagnostics, ISEs are commonly used 
to measure the activity or concentration of various ions 
and metabolites present in blood, plasma or serum, urine, 
and other biological fluids. For example, ISEs are 
typically used to determine Na⁺, Ca⁺⁺, Mg⁺⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, Li⁺ 
ions as well as the pH, and carbon dioxide content in 
such fluids. Conventional ion-selective electrodes are typically 
composed of an ion-selective membrane, an internal 
filling solution or electrolyte, and an internal 
reference electrode. Ion-selective electrodes can be 
classified according to the nature of the membrane 
material, and include solid state membrane electrodes,  
 
glass membrane electrodes, liquid membrane electrodes 
having charged ion-selective agents, and neutral liquid 
membrane electrodes having membranes formed from an 
organic solution containing an electrically neutral, ion-selective 
agent such as an ionophore held in an inert 
polymer matrix. An external reference electrode used in 
conjunction with the ISE to effect the assay measurement 
is typically a metal/metal halide electrode such as 
Ag/AgCl. When the ion selective membrane electrode is exposed 
or subjected to a sample solution, the ion of interest is 
selectively transferred from the sample solution into the 
membrane. The charge associated with the ions generate a 
potential that can be mathematically related to the 
concentration or activity of the ion content in the 
sample. If the membrane is ion specific or ideally 
selective toward the ion of interest, the potential 
difference is a linear function of the logarithm of the 
activity ratio of the ion activity (Nernst equation). A 
semi-empirical extension of the Nernst Equation 
(Nikolskii Eisenmann equation) for EMF may be utilized 
for non-ideal conditions.
