<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel oil compositions. and
more especially to fuel oil compositions susceptible to
wax formation at low temperatures, and to additive compositions
for such fuel oil compositions.Heating oils and other distillate petroleum fuels, for
example, diesel fuels, contain alkanes that at low temperature
tend to precipitate as large crystals of wax in
such a way as to form a gel structure which causes the
fuel to lose its ability to flow. The lowest temperature at
which the fuel will still flow is known as the pour point.As the temperature of the fuel falls and approaches
the pour point, difficulties arise in transporting the fuel
through lines and pumps. Further, the wax crystals tend
to plug fuel lines, screens, and filters at temperatures
above the pour point. These problems are well recognized
in the art, and various additives have been proposed,
many of which are in commercial use, for depressing
the pour point of fuel oils. Similarly, other additives
have been proposed and are in commercial use
for reducing the size and changing the shape of the wax
crystals that do form. Smaller size crystals are desirable
since they are less likely to clog a filter; certain additives
inhibit the wax from crystallizing as platelets and cause
it to adopt an acicular habit, the resulting needles being
more likely to pass through a filter than are platelets.
The additives may also have the effect of retaining in
suspension in the fuel the crystals that have formed, the
resulting reduced settling also assisting in prevention of
blockages.Effective wax crystal modification (as measured by
CFPP and other operability tests, as well as simulated
and field performance) may be achieved by ethylene-vinyl
acetate or propionate copolymer (EVAC or EVPC)-based
flow improvers.In EP-A-45342 is described a cold flow additive,
based on an EVAC modified by esterification with
2-ethylhexanoic, acrylic, and phthalic acids.In "Wissenschaft und Technik" 42(6), 238 (1989),
M. Ratsch & M. Gebauer describe cold flow additives
including an EVAC esterified with, interalia, n-hexanoic
acid.In U.S. Patent No. 3 961 916, middle distillate flow
improvers are described which comprise a wax growth
arrestor and a nucleating agent, the former being preferably
a lower molecular weight ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer
with a higher ester content, the latter preferably
a higher molecular weight copolymer with a lower ester
content, the esters preferably, but not necessarily, both
being vinyl acetate.In DE-AS-2407158, middle distillate
