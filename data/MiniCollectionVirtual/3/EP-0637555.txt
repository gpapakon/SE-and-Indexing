<ABSTRACT>
Garbage truck consisting of a truck body (1) provided at the rear 
with a fixed dump trough (3) and equipped with a compactor (6) 

sliding on inclined guides (13, 14) which can be totally or partially 
raised and rotate on an upper shaft (15) trasnverse to the truck body 

(1) to permit lifting of the compactor (6) while the body (1) is 
emptied with the shovel (4) equipped with an upwards moving flat 

section (21) to empty the fixed dump trough (3). The system for 
lifting and emptying of the road garbage bins (24) is located on the 

outer surface of the side frames of the truck body (1) and is 
controlled by a hydraulic fluid power unit with fixed rod (32) and 

mobile cylinder (37) fitted with a rackwork (44) acting on a gear 
wheel (31) connected to the control levers (28, 29) operating the 

fork (25) by which the road bin (24) is hooked up.

<DESCRIPTION>
They commonly are referred to as garbage trucks for solid urban 
refuse (S.U.R.) consisting of a truck body provided at the rear with 
a transverse dump trough in which the garbage is collected and with 
a garbage compactor in upward-downward reciprocating motion 
moving along sloping guides. This mobile compactor is equipped, at 
its lower end, with a scoop or shovel swinging on a cross shaft to 
remove the garbage from the dump trough and compact it in the 
front part of the truck body where the emptying shovel is located. These already known garbage trucks have, however, a serious 
drawback which lies in the fact that the sloping side guides of the 
swinging compactor are fixed to the side walls of the truck body and 
that this compacting equipment must be fitted on a rear charging 
mouth which can be lifted to allow for movement of the emptying 
shovel which otherwise would be prevented from performing its 
operation because of the compactor. The above mentioned charging mouth according to EP-A-085216, includes the dump 
trough and 
clearing devices for road garbage bins. It is thus obvious that this 
dump trough and the clearing equipment are lifted together with the 
compactor and the rear charging mouth. Therefore these garbage trucks for solid urban refuse that are 
provided with upwards moving charging mouth are very 
complicated and expensive.  
 There are also known according to EP-A-0 514 355, which discloses a 
garbage truck in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, and NL-A-8 
202 938 a vehicle for loading, compacting and 
discharging of refuse which presents a bottom wall of 
the body with an arc-shaped end portion in which the 
road garbage bins are emptied. A compacting device is 
articulated on the top of the body and it presents a 
plate articulated to the free end of the compacting 
device. This compacting device doesn't present lateral 
guides. Besides according to these Patents a movable 
plate is provided for discharging the refuse from the 
inside of the body and this plate is first extended and 
then it is rotated by means of levers and guides, to 
discharge the refuse from the arc-shaped end of the 
body. It is also known according to US-A-3 799 376 a refuse 
collecting vehicle with loading hopper in the rear of 
the vehicle body. A packing blade moves refuse from the 
hopper into the forward portion of the body and it may 
be reversed to sweep refuse from the hopper to a point 
exterior of the vehicle. It is also provided a movable 
eiector panel mounted transversely of the

or formed en bloc, whereby the en bloc guide, or the guide upper part 

(14) in the case of a divided guide, is 
pivotable about an upper shaft (15) transverse to the 

truck by means of a double acting hydraulic piston (16), 
whereby said compactor (6), when it is in an upper  

 
position, is able to pivot together with said en bloc 

or said upper part guide;
