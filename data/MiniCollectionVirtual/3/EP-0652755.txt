<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the therapeutical 
use of phosphoryl-L-serine-N-acyl-sphingosine composed 
of a mixture of compounds of formula I or II, 
  
 
in which n is an integer of 6-16 and R means an acyl 
residue of a higher aliphatic acid having between 16 and 
24 carbon atoms, the distribution of the values for n 
and R being those of a natural sphingomyelin. The 
invention also includes a new process for the 
preparation of these compounds, as well as 
pharmaceutical preparations containing said compounds as 
active ingredients. The ratio of the mixture of 
compounds of formulas (I) and (II) is not critical in 
order to use the compound of the present invention. The 
compound, as previously defined, was prepared by 
treatment with phospholipase D, as described in 
Biochemistry vol. 28, No. 8, 1989, 34-57, starting from 
a derivative of sphingomyelin (i.e. phosphorylcholine-N-acyl-sphingosine, 
in which the acyl group was derived 
from higher aliphatic acids of different molecular size 
and was variable between C12 and C24), and particularly 
to an analog of a sphingomyelin having an acyl group 
derived from 4-doxyl-pentanoic acid on the sphingosine 
amino group instead of the acyl residue R. In the cited 
paper there are no indications about pharmacological 
properties of the derivative. It has now been found that the compound has various 
interesting pharmacological properties and can be used 
therapeutically, especially in human medicine. More 
precisely the phosphoryl-L-serine-N-acyl-sphingosine of  
 
the present invention has an inhibiting action on the 
activation of protein kinase C, which activation can be 
undesired or have negative effect, in particular 
conditions of unbalance of the normal mechanisms of 
neurotransmittal functions. Activation is caused by an 
increased concentration of excititatory amino acids, 
like glutamic and/or aspartic acid; these acids have a 
direct toxic action on neuronal cells in the above 
mentioned abnormal conditions. Phosphoryl-L-serine-N-acyl-sphingosine can 
therefore be used in the therapy of many diseases of the 
central nervous system, as those arising after cerebral 
degenerations or lesions, like ischaemia, hypoxia, 
epilepsy, traumas and compressions, metabolic 
dysfunctions, aging, toxic-infective and chronic 
degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and 
Huntington's diseases. Phosphoryl-L-serine-N-acyl-sphingosine is moreover 
able to increase glycemia and histamine levels, 
resulting in cerebral glucose accumulation, which has
