<ABSTRACT>
A thermal insulating unit (1) comprises an elongate 
support member (3) having a linear density of from about 

5 to 150 mg/m and having attached thereto a generally 
dispersed array of discrete fine fibers (2) having 

diameters of from about 1.0 to 25.0 micrometers, wherein 
the average mass per axial unit length of fibers in the 

array is less than the mass per axial unit length of the 
support member. The units or clusters may be processed 

in traditional down handling equipment, an assembly of 
the thermal insulating units providing a very low density 

filling material having thermal and mechanical 
properties similar to that of natural down.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal insulating unit 
and to methods for manufacturing such units, as well as 
to a thermal insulating material comprising an assemblage 
of such units. More particularly, this invention relates 
to light-weight thermal insulation systems produced using 
fine fibers in low density cluster assemblies. Donovan, U.S. Patent No. 4,588,635, presents a useful 
discussion of the physics and mechanics of fiber assemblies and 
describes and claims a synthetic fiber batt thermal insulation 
which contains a specific intimate blend of fibers of two distinct 
diameters. The predominant fine microfiber species provides 
the thermal barrier characteristics, and the lesser proportion 
of large diameter macrofiber enhances the mechanical 
properties required in a practical insulator. The concept of 
providing an optimum combination of thermal and mechanical 
performance through the provision of a blend of fine and coarse 
fibers was extended in Donovan et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,992,327, 
which describes a bonded version of the '635 invention with even 
more advantageous mechanical properties. There has been considerable activity over the past few years 
in the general area of high performance thermal insulation, and 
several other patents have issued which embody various combinations  
 
of fibers in a range of configurations, each exploiting and 
claiming particular advantages. Examples of such patents include 
U.S. Patent No. 4,118,531 to Hauser, U.S. Patent No. 4,304,817 to 
Frankosky, U.S. Patent No. 4,551,378 to Carey, and U.S. No. 
5,043,207 to Donovan and Skelton. These patents provide a good 
overview of this area, which has developed to a high degree of 
sophistication. One feature which most of the above patents have in common 
is that they provide, as an end point, a thermal insulating batt. 
That is, the product is available as extended sheets, and it is 
usually supplied to the user in roll form. This is highly beneficial 
to most users since the roll form is easy and convenient 
to handle in the layout and cutting stages of the making-up 
process, and the cost-effectiveness of the downstream manufacturing 
process is enhanced. However, it is important to realize 
that a considerable industry exists which is devoted to the 
manufacture of end-use insulating items which utilize down as a 
filling agent, and the manufacturing techniques employed by this 
traditional segment of the industry are completely different from 
those which utilize batts. The essential difference is
