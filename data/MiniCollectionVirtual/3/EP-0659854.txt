<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition which comprises a dispersion in an 
aqueous medium of a dispersed vinyl polymer which is 

stabilised in dispersion by the presence of a stabiliser which 
is an epoxy resin, which has at least two hydrolysable silane 

groups and at least one protonated or quaternised amine group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating compositions comprising 
aqueous vinyl polymer dispersions, to a process for their 
preparation and to their use in a coating process. It also 
relates to coated substrates obtainable by the coating 
process. Aqueous dispersions of vinyl polymers are well known and are 
commonly used as the basis of coating compositions. Such 
aqueous dispersions comprise small particles or droplets of 
vinyl polymer which are held in dispersion in an aqueous 
medium by a dispersion stabiliser. The polymer is derived from 
ethylenically unsaturated acrylic or vinyl monomers by free 
radical polymerisation. The dispersion stabiliser has a 
hydrophillic component and a component which is either 
adsorbed onto, or which is covalently bonded to, the vinyl 
polymer. One specific type of aqueous vinyl polymer dispersion is 
disclosed in US 5 118 752. This patent discloses the use of 
certain specific stabilisers which have hydrophobic and 
hydrophillic moieties, silicon moieties and amido 
functionality. These stabilisers are made by the reaction of 
polyisocyanates with acid functional diols and aminosilanes.  One problem with these dispersions is that they are not stable 
for long periods. This means that the film-forming ability of 
these dispersions deteriorates during storage. In particular, 
the properties of films formed from these compositions, such 
as water resistance, after the compositions have been stored 
for three months are poorer than those of films formed from 
freshly prepared compositions. This is clearly unacceptable 
in many areas of the coatings industry where paints are often 
required to be storage stable for six months or more. Not only that, but stabilisers derived from polyurethane 
polymers such as those in US 5 118 752 are expensive in 
relation to the cost of the acrylic polymer and so add 
considerably to the overall cost of the polymer dispersion. We have now found that vinyl polymer dispersions can be 
stabilised by certain stabilisers based on epoxy resins, which 
have hydrolysable silane groups and cationic hydrophillic 
groups. These dispersions have improved long term stability, 
while the stabiliser is economical to use in comparison with 
polyurethane-derived stabilisers. The dispersions also form 
films having good early water resistance. According to the present invention there is provided a coating 
composition which comprises a dispersion in an aqueous medium 
of a dispersed vinyl polymer which is stabilised in dispersion 
by the presence of a
