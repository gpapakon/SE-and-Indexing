<ABSTRACT>
Storage phosphor imaging system (10) includes 
a source of stimulating light (56), a scanner (72),(34) 

for scanning a storage phosphor (24) with said 
stimulating light in a raster pattern to produce an 

emitted light image and a photodetector (82) for 
converting the emitted light image into an image 

signal. Erase lamps (88) erase any residual image in 
the storage phosphor (24). Failure in one or more 

erase lamps (88) is detected by an erase lamp failure 
detection circuit (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to storage
phosphor systems in which a latent x-ray image is
recorded in a storage phosphor. A storage phosphor
reader converts the stored latent x-ray image into an
x-ray image signal. After conversion, the storage
phosphor is erased and reused. This invention relates
more particularly to a storage phosphor reader having
erase lamp failure detection.In a storage phosphor imaging system as
described in US-A-Re 31,847, a storage phosphor is
exposed to an x-ray image of an object, such as the
body part of a patient, to record a latent x-ray image
in the storage phosphor. The latent x-ray image is
read out by stimulating the storage phosphor with
relatively long wavelength stimulating radiation such
as red or infrared light produced by a helium neon gas
laser or diode laser. Upon stimulation, the storage
phosphor releases emitted radiation of an intermediate
wavelength, such as blue light, in proportion to the
quantity of x-rays that were received. To produce a
signal useful in electronic image processing the
storage phosphor is scanned in a raster pattern by a
laser beam deflected by an oscillating or rotating
scanning mirror or hologon. The emitted radiation from
the storage phosphor is reflected by a mirror light
collector and detected by a photodetector, such as a
photomultiplier, to produce an electronic image signal.
Typically the storage phosphor is translated in a page
scan direction past the laser beam which is repeatedly
deflected in a line scan direction perpendicular to the
page scan motion of the storage phosphor to form a
scanning raster pattern of a matrix of pixels.In order to be able to reuse the storage
phosphor, any residual image in the storage phosphor is 
erased by exposing it to light from suitable erase lamps,
such as fluorescent lamps. If one or more erase lamps fail,
erasure of the storage phosphor will be incomplete leaving
a residual image in the storage phosphor. When it is
reused, a new latent x-ray image will be recorded over the
residual image resulting in unacceptable image degradation
which can result in improper diagnosis. US-A-4,754,145,
discloses a radiation image erase unit for use with
stimulable phosphor sheets. The erase unit has a detecting
means for detecting a reduction in the illuminance of an
erasure light and for producing a signal indicative of the
light reduction. The embodiment shown in Fig. 6 of this
patent has a current sensor for each erasing light source
to detect failure of individual light sources. This
embodiment is
