<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing decorated ceramic and glass products, according to which a coloured ceramic composition containing fine particles comprising ceramic pigments and binder resin(s) and, if desired, further additives is applied by means of an electrophotographic reproduction process to a transfer agent, e.g. paper coated with gum arabic, the transfer agent coated with the coloured ceramic composition is applied to the ceramic or glass product and, after removing the transfer agent, the coloured ceramic composition is bonded to the ceramic or glass product by firing. The invention further comprises decorated ceramic or glass products obtainable by the above process, and also a coloured ceramic composition of the abovementioned type.

Process for preparing decorated ceramic and glass
products, according to which ceramic colour compositions

are applied to a transferring agent, the transferring
agent coated with the ceramic colour compositions is

applied to the ceramic or glass product, and, after
removing the transferring agent, the ceramic colour

compositions are joined to the product by firing,
characterised in that the ceramic colour compositions

contain fine particles including in each case ceramic
pigments and binder resin(s), in that the proportion of

ceramic pigments in the ceramic colour compositions is 10
to 70 wt.%, in that the ceramic pigments form particle

cores which are surrounded by binder resin(s), and in
that the ceramic colour compositions are applied to the

transferring agent by means of an electrophotographic
reproduction process (electrocopying process).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the ceramic pigments are colouring substances of the

spinel type or zirconium silicate type.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the binder resin is composed of one or more vinyl

monomers.
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that
the binder resin is composed of styrene or derivatives

thereof alone or in combination with other vinyl monomers
or of ester derivatives. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the fine particles have a

size of 1 to 50 µm.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ceramic colour

compositions also include one or more additives from the
series comprising charge-control agents, means for

improving the flowability, magnetic particles and carrier
particles.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the transferring agent is a

paper substrate which is coated with gum arabic,
polyvinyl acetate or wax.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ceramic colour

compositions are applied to the transferring agent by
means of a laser printer.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ceramic colour

compositions are applied to the transferring agent at a
layer thickness of 0.1 mm - 3 mm, preferably 0.3 mm - 0.6

mm.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ceramic colour

compositions are fixed without pressure using heat after
transfer to the transferring agent.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that during the

electrophotographic reproduction process, the mixing 
ratio between the ceramic colour compositions and the

developer is set at a range between 30 wt.% and 80 wt.%
of toner.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ceramic colour

compositions are fixed additionally by means of a clear
lacquer after application to the transferring agent.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that th
e ceramic colour
compositions are fired at a temperature in the range from

800 to 1,500°C.
Decorated ceramic or glass products which can be
obtained by a process according to one of the above

claims 1 to 13.
Ceramic colour composition, characterised in that it
contains fine particles including in each case ceramic

pigments, binder resin(s) and optionally one or more
additives from the series comprising charge-control

agents, means for improving the flowability, carrier
particles and magnetic particles, in that the quantity by

weight of ceramic pigments is 10 to 70 % in the ceramic
colour composition, and in that the ceramic pigments form

particle cores which are surrounded by binder resin(s).
Ceramic colour composition according to claim 15,
characterised in that the ceramic pigments are compounds

of the spinel type or of the zirconium silicate type.
Ceramic colour composition according to claim 15 or
16, characterised in that the binder resin is composed of

one or more vinyl monomers. 
Ceramic colour composition according to claim 17,
characterised in that the binder resin is composed of

styrene or derivatives thereof alone or in combination
with other vinyl monomers or of ester derivatives.
