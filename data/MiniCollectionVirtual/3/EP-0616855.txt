<ABSTRACT>
In order to coat a strip-like or band-like material (1) or to machine it on its surface, the invention provides, in a corresponding arrangement, at least one cylinder-like device or drum (7) which can rotate, at least to the greatest extent, about its spindle and on which the material is guided along a portion (8a), provision being made for the coating or the machining to be carried out on said portion. In order that this takes place, to the greatest extent, uniformly or the contact-pressure force of the rotatable device on the material to be treated or coated is uniform, the spindle (9) of the device is mounted such that it can be displaced at least in the direction of at least two press-on rollers (3, 5). The two press-on rollers (3, 5) are spaced apart by a distance (a) which is smaller than the external diameter (d) of the device (7). Furthermore, said press-on rollers are provided in order to guide the strip-like or band-like material at least along a portion of their surface and to transfer it onto the drum (7) and, respectively, to receive it from said drum. Due to a tensile stress which is applied or prevails on the material in the longitudinal direction, the device or drum is thus driven against the press-on rollers, as a result of which a uniform contact-pressure force can be set by means of the applied tensile stress, as a result of which, for example, the layer thickness of the coating can be adjusted by means of the tensile stress.
