<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing components made of 
zirconium-based alloy by combining heat treatment with 

thermal sizing. The heat treatment includes heating the 
component to a temperature which initiates the transformation 

from a hexagonal close-packed crystallographic 
phase of uniform texture to a body-centered cubic 

crystallographic phase and then quenching to a quench 
temperature at a rate which initiates transformation to 

a hexagonal close-packed crystallographic phase having 
a texture factor 
f
L
 = 0.28-0.38. The thermal sizing 
includes heating the component to a temperature less 

than the quench temperature, but sufficient to anneal 
the component, and then cooling. Preferably, the 

thermal sizing is performed twice: before and after the 
heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a method for 
manufacturing hollow, thin-walled, precisely dimensioned 
components for use in a nuclear reactor. In particular, 
the invention relates to a method for manufacturing fuel 
channels made from metal alloy, such as zirconium-based 
alloy. A boiling water reactor (BWR) has nuclear fuel 
assemblies comprising bundles of fuel rods made of 
fissionable materials capable of releasing a finite 
number of neutrons. Neutrons are released due to 
fission at high speed and then moderated by the water 
to a lower speed at which the neutrons can produce a 
chain reaction of fission events. Each fuel assembly 
is surrounded by a fuel channel made of metal which 
parasitically absorbs neutrons. To minimize parasitic 
absorption of neutrons, fuel channels are typically 
fabricated from a metal alloy known as Zircaloy, which 
absorbs very few thermal neutrons, i.e., has a low 
absorption cross section. Zircaloy is an alloy of 
zirconium with small amounts of iron, tin and other 
alloy metals. In particular, Zircaloy-2 contains about 
1.5% tin, 0.15% iron, 0.1% chromium, 0.05% nickel and 
0.1% oxygen, whereas Zircaloy-4 contains substantially 
no nickel and about 0.2% iron but otherwise is similar 
to Zircaloy-2.  Fuel channels are hollow elongated components of 
generally square cross section, which may measure 
approximately 6 inches on each side and on the order of 
14 feet in length. Typically, the channels are created 
by rolling strips of Zircaloy, bending the strips into 
U-shaped channel sections and then seam welding two 
U-shaped channel sections together to form a single fuel 
channel. Reactor control occurs typically on the 
exterior of such fuel channels. To optimize nuclear 
reactor control, the fuel channels are formed with flat 
sides which conform to the shapes of the control rods. The fuel channels also serve the purpose of 
confining the coolant water flowing through the nuclear 
core to a predictable flow path around the steam-generating 
fuel rods. To assure predictable water flow 
in the reactor, there is a pressure differential between 
the inside and the outside of the fuel channels. The 
water flowing inside the fuel channel is turned into 
steam by the heat released during fission. The outside 
of the fuel channel constitutes a different pressure 
environment. The planar fuel channel walls are connected by 
corners and tend to bulge responsive to the pressure 
differential. This tendency to bulge is additionally 
aggravated by thermal effects and
