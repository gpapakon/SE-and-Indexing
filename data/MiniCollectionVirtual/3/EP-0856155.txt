<ABSTRACT>
Fluorescent and chemiluminescent labelling compositions comprise a linear polysaccharide backbone molecule having a plurality of target-binding molecules, such as antibodies or nucleic acids, attached at spaced-apart intervals thereon. Each of the target-binding molecules, in turn, includes a multiplicity of fluorescent or chemiluminescent dye molecules bound thereto. In this way, signal introduced to a single target-site on a solid phase surface may be increased without loss of binding activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
compositions and methods for detecting target substances in
biological samples. More particularly, the present invention
relates to labelling compositions comprising a multiplicity of
fluorescent or luminescent dye molecules bound to a plurality
of binding molecules which in turn are bound to a linear
polysaccharide backbone.Many methods are known for detecting specific
biological substances in solution and on solid phase supports.
Of particular interest to the present invention are
immunochemical methods where binding of a detectable label to
a target substance in a biological sample is mediated by a
specific binding substance. For example, a labelled specific
binding substance, such as a fluorescently-labelled or a
chemiluminescently labelled antibody, which recognizes the
target substance (e.g., an antigen or hapten) is exposed to a
biological specimen suspected of containing the target
substance, and presence of the target substance is confirmed
by binding of the label. Similar techniques may be performed
using nucleic acid hybridization methods, where nucleic acid
sequences of interest may be detected with a labelled
polynucleotide which recognizes its complementary sequence in
the nucleic acids of the biological specimen. In both cases,
if present, the target substance will thus bind to the
fluorescent or luminescent label, allowing detection based on
fluorescent or light emissions of the label. Fluorescent labels offer a number of advantages
compared with other common assay labels, such as enzyme
labels. The detection of fluorescent labels is simple and
does not require the addition of a substrate as is common with
many enzyme labels. The signal generated by fluorescent label
is localized, permitting the detection of multiple analytes in
different reaction zones within a single reaction region or
chamber. Thus, fluorescent labels allow simplified protocols
for the detection of multiple analytes where only the final
detection step must be performed separately for different
analytes.Of specific interest to the present invention, a
class of cyanine fluorescent materials, referred to as
"arylsulfonate cyanine fluorescent dyes," having particularly
desirable properties has been developed. The arylsulfonate
cyanine fluorescent dyes have high extinction coefficients
(typically from 130,000 L/mole to 250,000 L/mole, good quantum
yields, fluorescent emission spectra in a range (500 nm to
750 nm) which is outside of the autofluorescence wavelengths
