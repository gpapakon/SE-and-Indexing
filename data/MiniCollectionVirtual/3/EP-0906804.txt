<ABSTRACT>
Hollow components are formed from sheets of material (2,3) that have been joined together by laser seam welding along the edges (6). The material is located within a high pressure hydraulic die set (9). Here a high pressure lance (19) pierces the weld seam and allows fluid to enter between the sheets. The high fluid forces cause the sheets to deform and adopt the shape of the die (8)

A method of producing a hollow body from two metal
blanks (2, 3) laid flat one on top of the other, which,

in order to form the hollow body, being placed inside an
internal-high-pressure forming tool (9) and in the closed

state thereof, are expanded, by introducing a pressurised
fluid at high pressure into the dividing join (23)

existing between the blanks, until they are in contact
with the sink contour (8) of the forming tool determining

the final shape of the hollow body, the blanks (2, 3)
being welded to one another in a through-weld by beam

welding, and the resultant blank unit being trimmed by
means of a cutting process and the pressurised fluid

inlet region of the blank unit being cut off after
expansion,
characterised in that

prior to being inserted in the forming tool (9), the
blanks (2, 3) are seam-welded and the resultant blank

unit (1) is then trimmed in the weld seam (4, 5) by means
of a beam cutting process and the blank unit (1) is then

inserted in the forming tool (9) in readiness for the
expansion-forming process in such a way that a part of

the through-weld seam (4, 5) thereof bearing trimmed
edges (7) lies inside the sink (8) of the forming tool

(9), the blank unit (1) being clamped only in the region
(17) of the pressurised fluid inlet.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

the trimming is performed by laser-cutting, the trimmed
edge (7) being rounded by fusion during cutting.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the hollow body (34) is calibrated at a fluid pressure

higher than that of the expansion.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

to produce a longitudinal hollow body (34) with a
secondary formed element (32), the blanks (2, 3) are

inserted in the appropriately configured forming tool (9)
in such a way that the weld seam (4, 5) by which the

blanks (2, 3) are welded to one another lies outside the
branch (29) of the sink (8) of the forming tool (9)

corresponding to the secondary formed element (32) to be
produced.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

prior to producing a longitudinal hollow body (34) with
a secondary formed element (32), several metal sheets of

a same material but of differing thicknesses are welded
to one another to form a blank (3) forming one of the

blanks (2, 3) from which the hollow body (34) will be
produced, and when the blank unit (1) is placed in the

forming tool (9), this blank (3) is disposed with the
part having a greater thickness lying opposite the region

of the branch (29) of the sink (8) of the forming tool
(9) having the corresponding secondary shaped element

(32) in such a way that the weld seams of the metal
sheets lie outside the branch (29).
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

prior to making a longitudinal hollow body (34) with a
secondary shaped element (32), several metal sheets of

materials of differing ductility are welded to one
another to form a blank (3) forming one of the blanks (2, 

3) from which the hollow body (34) will be produced, and
when the blank unit (1) is inserted in the forming tool

(9), this blank (3) is disposed with the part consisting
of the more ductile material lying opposite the region of

the branch (29) of the sink (8) of the forming tool (9)
corresponding to the secondary formed element (32) in

such a way that the weld seams of the metal sheets lie
outside the branch (29).
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

two weld seams (4, 5) extending parallel and terminating
at terminal edges (6) of the blanks (2, 3) are produced

by seam-welding, the pressurised fluid being introduced
into the non-welded dividing join (23) of the blanks (2,

3) between the weld seams (4, 5) for expansion forming
purposes.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that

the seam welding is performed in a closed curve, the weld
seam being cut off, during subsequent trimming of the

welded blank unit (1), at one portion to leave open the
dividing join (23) of the blanks (2, 3), which forms the

region (17) of the pressurised fluid inlet for the
subsequent expansion forming process.
