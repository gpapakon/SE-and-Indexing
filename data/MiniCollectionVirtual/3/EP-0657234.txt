<ABSTRACT>
A mold is provided which can greatly reduce cutting 
of an engine block of an internal combustion engine to aim 

at a cost reduction. A mold for casting an engine block 
of a two-cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine, 

an upper inner mold is integrally formed with a cam chain 
storing chamber upper inner mold disposed intermediate of 

right and left liner retaining projections, for defining 
an upper portion of an inner surface of a tensioner lifter 

supporting hole. A lower inner mold is formed with a cam 
chain storing chamber (10) lower inner mold (28) opposed to the cam 

chain storing chamber (10) upper inner mold (27) of the upper inner 
mold, for defining a lower 
portion of the inner surface of 
the tensioner lifter supporting hole. The lower inner 

mold (28) is further formed with an upper projection (32) projecting 
upward from an inner opening edge upper portion of the 

tensioner lifter supporting hole (22) facing a cam chain 
storing chamber (10). A rear outer mold (24) is formed with a lower 

projection projecting downward from an outer opening edge 
lower portion of the tensioner lifter supporting hole 

facing the cam chain storing chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mold for casting
a laterally central portion of an engine block of an
internal combustion engine to be mounted on a motorcycle
or the like according to the preamble of claim 1.Figure 9 shows a conventional multicylinder in-line
internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinders
tilted at their upper portions toward the front side of
the engine. In such an internal combustion engine, an
engine block 01 is formed by integrating a cylinder block
and an upper crankcase 02. A crankcase is parted into the
upper crankcase 02 of the engine block 01 and a lower
crankcase 03 along a plane 04. A crankshaft 05 is
rotatably supported in the plane 04, and a main shaft and 
a counter shaft (both not shown) for supporting gears of
a transmission are also rotatably supported in the plane
04. A chain storing chamber 07 for driving overhead valve
operating camshafts 06 is defined between the cylinders
adjacent to each other rather than at one of right and
left sides of the engine block 01. A supporting hole 09
for supporting a tensioner lifter 08 is formed through a
wall of the chain storing chamber 07 at an upper side
portion thereof so as to be inclined toward a line
connecting axial centers of the cylinders.The US-A-4 757 857 shows a similar mold for an engine block without
chamber between adjacent cylinders.Conventionally, the engine block 01 is cast by using
a mold as shown in Figure 9. That is, the mold shown is
composed of an upper inner mold 010, a lower inner mold
011, a front outer mold 012, and a rear outer mold 013.In the engine block 01 cast by using the mold shown
in Figure 9, a wall thickness of the engine block 01 at a
portion thereof near the supporting hole 09 for the
tensioner lifter 08 is made large, so as to reliably bear
against vibration of a tensioner. Additionally, a padding
of the engine block is increased in relation to mold
releasing, and blowholes are easily generated.
Furthermore, the amount of cutting of the wall of the
supporting hole 09 is increased to result in an increase
in cutting time and material cost. Accordingly, it is
difficult to improve the productivity.In addition, a conventional four-cycle internal
combustion engine is provided with a cam chain tensioner
device for removing slack of an endless chain wound around
cam sprockets integral with valve operating cams and a
sprocket integral with a crankshaft to provide the endless
chain with a proper tension.A load applied to the valve operating cams is
periodically changed in concert with
