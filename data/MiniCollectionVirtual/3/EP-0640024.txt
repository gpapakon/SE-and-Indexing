<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum plate system comprises a support plate (310) formed of a plurality of support plate modules (320-380) that are supported on a base plate, and serve to transfer vacuum between vacuum apertures in the base plate and a workpiece held on the support plate (310). The support plate module (340) is formed with a plurality of circular lip seals (341) of larger size, and disposed therebetween, a plurality of lip seals (349) of smaller size. The area within each of the lip seals (341, 349) has a small hole extending through the respective support plate module, to transfer vacuum in a restricted manner. The remaining support plate modules are of a similar configuration, but with variations. In machining of a workpiece held on the support plate modules (320-280), the modules may be cut into, without risk of losing the vacuum overall holding effect on the workpiece. The specification discloses various other support plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to support plates of vacuum plate systems.Vacuum plates are well known in the engineering field as means for
holding a workpiece securely in place, whilst a machining operation is
performed on it. They may take various shapes. For example, they may be
generally flat, rectangular tables, which afford a substantially horizontal
support surface to workpieces. Alternatively, they may be of circular shape,
affording a substantially upright support surface upon which a workpiece is
secured, in the manner of a chuck.In fact, such a latter configuration may be referred to as a "vacuum
chuck", but for the sake of convenience, in this specification, the term
"vacuum plate" is used to refer to all possible configurations of support means
which retain a workpiece or other article in position by means of a vacuum -
whether for machining, any other operation, or simply holding and/or transport.
Although the term "vacuum" is used here conveniently, it is usually the case
in practice that a perfect vacuum is never achieved - an average pressure of
around 0.1 bar is more usual.US-A-2 782 574 discloses a support plate adapted to be disposed
between a base plate of a vacuum plate system and a workpiece to be held by
the vacuum plate system, the support plate comprising a sheet of material
having a reverse surface and a working surface for contact respectively with
a said base plate and workpiece, a plurality of holes that pass through the sheet
of material to transfer vacuum, in use, between said reverse and working
surfaces; and a plurality of resilient projections each provided on said working 
surface to form, in use, a seal with a contact surface of a respective workpiece,
the seal formed by each of said resilient projections having a closed, circular
shape in plan view.However, the support plate disclosed therein is a traditional solid and
rigid plate with separately formed seal members, and is not suitable either to
be cut into by a machining tool or to be formed relatively cheaply as a
disposable or throw-away item.In the published specification of our PCT patent application No.
WO 92/10336
which forms part of the state of the art according to article 54(3)EPC,
we disclose a number of vacuum plate systems each of which
comprises a base plate for providing a source of vacuum distributed over an
area of the plate, and a support plate which is disposed between the base plate
and a workpiece to be held by the vacuum plate system.Various support plates are disclosed, and their purpose generally is
