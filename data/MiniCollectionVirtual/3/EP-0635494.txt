formula (I) 
wherein 
Ais a phenyl ring unsubstituted or substituted by one 
to three substituents independently chosen from 
halogen, CF₃, C₁-C₄ alkyl and C₁-C₄ alkoxy; R₁is phenyl unsubstituted or substituted by halogen,

a phenyl ring unsubstituted or substituted either by 
C₁-C₄ alkoxy or by one or two substituents chosen 
from halogen and CF₃ and R₁ is a phenyl ring 
unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, CF₃ or C₁-C₄ 
alkoxy; C₅-C₆ cycloalkyl; or C₁-C₆ alkyl, then W is 
other than a group -OR as defined above. The invention also includes within its scope all the 
possible isomers, stereoisomers and their mixtures and 
the metabolites and the metabolic precursors or bio-precursors
