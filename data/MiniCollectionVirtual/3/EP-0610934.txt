<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for loading objects packed in alternating orientations, 
for 

loading into automatic machines for the purposes of subsequent processing 
where the objects must be presented one by one with the same orientation 

comprises two angle plates, a magazine carriage (3), thrust means (5), 
an 

elevator (8), a translationally moveable extractor unit (9), a track (13) 
for removing 

the extracted objects (18,18'), parallel guides (16) along the final 
stretch of said 

track, separated from each other by a distance equal to the least 
thickness of the extracted objects, two other removing tracks downstream 

of said parallel guides, one track leading to the automatic machine to 
which the objects are to be fed, and the other leading to means for 

inverting said objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and to a method for 
loading automatic machines with objects packed in bulk in alternating 
orientations for the purposes of subsequent processing where, however, 
the objects must be presented one by one with the same orientation. Generally speaking, objects are packed together in alternating 
orientations in situations where, if they were all orientated the same 
way, they would not stack easily and would occupy too much space inside 
a pack, making it necessary for large boxes to be used and so wasting 
space and money. A typical example of such objects is cassettes for holding recording 
tape, also known as musicassettes. These have one long side with a 
thickness of approximately 9 mm and the opposite side with a thickness 
of approximately 12 mm. For this reason they are packed in alternating 
orientations in layers, or planes, each consisting of a certain number 
of rows. In order to make it possible for the recording tape to be 
inserted in the cassettes, or labels to be stuck thereto, it is necessary 
to extract these cassettes from the pack, arrange them in single file, 
and send them, all oriented in the same direction, to the automatic 
machine for insertion of the tape. The object of the present invention is to provide a simple and 
economical solution to this problem. Its in automatic machines for the 
purposes of subsequent processing where said objects must be presented 
one by one with the same orientation, the apparatus being characterized 
in that it comprises: a false box formed by freely associating two angle 
plates, which box can be inserted into the packing boxes; a mobile 
magazine carriage fitted with retaining members for accommodating and 
holding said false box; a slide moving parallel to and located above the 
magazine carriage, with thrust means mounted on it at one side of the 
magazine carriage, the thrust means moving in the same direction; on the 
opposite side of the magazine carriage an elevator whose base is equal  
 
to the base of one column of said objects; an extractor unit able to move 
translationally perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the 
magazine carriage, of the thrust means and of the slide; a track on which 
the extracted objects are removed from the extractor unit; a pair of 
parallel guides along the final stretch of said track, separated from 
each other by a distance corresponding to the least thickness of the 
extracted objects and running above said removing track; and two other 
removing

Apparatus for loading objects packed in rows and columns, in 
superimposed layers, into automatic machines for the purposes of 

subsequent processing where said objects must be presented one by one 
with the same orientation, the apparatus being characterized in that it 

comprises: a false box formed by freely associating two angle plates, 
which box can be inserted into the packing boxes; a mobile magazine 

carriage fitted with retaining members for accommodating and holding said 
false box; a slide moving parallel to and located above the magazine 

carriage, with thrust means mounted on it at one side of the magazine 
carriage, the thrust means moving in the same direction; on the opposite 

side of the magazine carriage an elevator whose base is equal to the base 
of one column of said objects; an extractor unit able to move translationally 

perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the magazine 
carriage, of the thrust means and of the slide; a track on which the 

extracted objects are removed from the extractor unit; a pair of parallel 
guides along the final stretch of said track, separated from each other 

by a distance corresponding to the least thickness of the extracted 
objects and running above said removing track; and two other removing 

tracks leading away from the first track, immediately downstream of said 
parallel guides, one track leading to the automatic machine to which the 

objects are to be fed and the other leading to means for inverting said 
objects. 
Apparatus according to claim 1), in which the angle plates 
forming said false box are made of a rigid material. 
Apparatus according to claim 1) or 2), in which said false box 
consists of a pair of angle plates mounted with their smaller faces 

superimposed, the area of their lateral faces being a little less than 
the area of the lateral faces of the packing box. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, in which 
said thrust means comprise a piston in a cylinder and an end plate 

perpendicular thereto whose dimensions are less than or equal to those 
 

of the open face comprised between said angle plates of said false box. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, in which 
said translationally moveable extractor unit comprises a high-speed 

rotating wheel and a translational drive for the unit. 
Apparatus according to claim 5), in which at least the circumference 
of said rotating wheel is of a material having a high coefficient 

of friction. 
Apparatus according to claim 6), in which said circumference of 
said wheel has a rubber coating. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, in which 
said removing tracks are conveyor belts. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, in which 
the objects to be loaded are musicassettes. 
Method for loading automatic machines with packed objects for 
subsequent processing where said objects must be presented one by one 

with the same orientation, the method being characterized in that it 
comprises the following stages: extracting the packed objects from the 

box without altering their orientation as packed; loading the objects on 
to a magazine frame; extracting one column at a time of said objects and 

approaching it to object extraction means; extracting the objects one by 
one from said column; and removing said objects from said frame. 
Method according to claim 10), comprising also the following 
stages: separating said objects into two groups according to their 

orientation; and inverting those of said objects which are presented in 
one of said orientations. 
Method according to claim 11), performed with the aid of an 
apparatus according to Claims 1 to 9.
