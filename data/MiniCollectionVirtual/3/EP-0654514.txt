A hydrophilic surface-treating aqueous solution and 
a hydrophilic surface-treating method are provided to 

form a film which can maintain its hydrophilicity. The 
hydrophilic surface-treating aqueous solution contains as 

main components polyglutamic acid, basic compound, and 
aqueous resin if necessary. This surface-treating 

solution and method enable the forming of a film on the 
surface of aluminum series metals which are used for 

aluminium fins of heat exchangers, and confer 
anticorrosion properties, superior hydrophilicity an
d 
high hydrophilic permanency, while remarkably suppressing 

an offensive odor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a hydrophilic
surface-treating aqueous solution and hydrophilic surface-treating
method, and more particularly, to a hydrophilic
surface-treating aqueous solution and method used for forming
an anticorrosive and hydrophilic film onto aluminum products
such as aluminum fins of a heat exchanger.Aluminium and its alloys are widely utilized for heat
exchangers due to its light-weight and superior
processability and thermal conductivity. With the spread of
air conditioning systems, a number of systems incorporating
cooling, dehumidifying, and cooling/heating functions are
available. In these air-conditioners, fins made of aluminum
alloy are typically provided on the heat exchanging sections.During the cooling mode of the air-conditioners, the
moisture in the air tends to attach to the surface of the
fins in the form of condensed water. In order to prevent the
attachment of the condensed water, it could be conceived to
confer a water repellency on the fin surface. However, the
water repellency properties may cause the adhesion of
hemispherical condensed water drops onto the fin surface
and/or presence of bridge-like water between the fins. This
will disadvantageously prevent the air flow of the heat
exchanger and increase the ventilation resistance. Thus, the
repellent fin surface may contribute to the reduction in heat
exchanging efficiency. Aluminum and its alloy originally have good
anticorrosion characteristics. However, in the case where
the condensed water remains on the fin surface for a long
period of time, hydration reaction or corrosion reaction are
accelerated due to the formation of the oxygen concentration
cell on the fin surface and to the adhesion and condensation
of the contaminated component in air. The corrosion products
which have been produced by the above reaction accumulate on
the fin surface, which will impair the heat exchange ability
and during the heating drive in winter cause the exhaust of
white minute powder particles from the air fan together with
the warmed air.In order to solve the above problems, it has thus
become desirable in recent years to improve the
hydrophilicity and anticorrosion on the fin surface.For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,973,359, entitled
"SURFACE TREATMENT CHEMICAL AND BATH FOR FORMING HYDROPHILIC
COATINGS AND METHOD OF SURFACE-TREATING ALUMINUM MEMBERS",
discloses a hydrophilic surface-treating chemical and so on
which contain predetermined amounts of sodium salt and/or
potassium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose, ammonium
