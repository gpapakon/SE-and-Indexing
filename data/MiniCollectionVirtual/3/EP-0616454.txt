<ABSTRACT>
Multi-resolution digital transmission system able to discriminate a first low resolution level by detection of groups of symbols as well as at least one second high resolution level by detection of symbols in the groups of symbols. The system comprises a transmitter (5) equipped with means (14, 16, 18) for differentially modulating the groups of symbols allocated to the low-resolution level and a receiver (6) equipped with means for detecting (20) groups of differentially modulated symbols and for supplying detected symbols allocated to the low-resolution level. In a higher-performance operating mode, the detection means of the receiver can detect symbols allocated to the high-resolution level. The system can be used for digital transmission of television signals with double resolution. Application: digital transmission with double resolution; digital television.
