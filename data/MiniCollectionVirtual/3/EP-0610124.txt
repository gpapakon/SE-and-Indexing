<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for assembling, in a plurality of adjustable positions, two constituents of a prosthesis, in which a projecting part (4) which is integral with one (1) of these constituents is engaged into a cup-shaped recess (5) in the other constituent of the prosthesis or in an intermediate linking element (2), or vice versa, it being possible for screws engaged in transverse threaded recesses of the cup (1) to come to abut against the side flanks of the projection part (4) in order to lock this projecting part in position with respect to the cup (5). According to the invention, the outer edge of the cup-shaped recess (5) bears so as to be able to slide in any direction in a plane while bearing on a plane surface of the constituent (1) from which the part (4) projects, whereas this projecting part (4) is, in all positions, separated from the bottom of the cup-shaped recess (5).

A system for assembling, in a plurality of adjustable 
positions, two components of a prosthesis, in which a 

projecting part (4) firmly with one (1) of these components 
is engaged in a recess forming a trough (5) in the other 

component of the prosthesis or an intermediate connecting 
element (2), or vice versa, screws engaged in threaded 

transverse recesses in the trough (5) being capable of coming 
into a position of abutment against the lateral faces of the 

projecting part (4) to lock the latter in position with 
respect to the trough (5), this system being characterised in 

that the outer edge of the recess forming the trough (5) 
rests, in such a way as to be able to slide rectilinearly in 

at least one direction, on a surface of the component (1) 
from which the part (4) projects, while in all positions this 

projecting part (4) is spaced apart from the base of the 
recess forming the trough (5). 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the edge of the trough (5) rests with at least a first flat 

surface against at least one other flat surface of the 
element (1) firmly with the projecting part (4), the first 

and second surfaces being arranged in such a way as to be 
able to slide relative to one another. 
A system according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the part (1'
a
) firmly connected with 
the projecting element (4'
a
) and said element constitute two 
distinct elements in contact via a flat surface against which 

there rests the element (2') comprising a recess forming a 
trough (5'), the part (1'
a
) and the element (4'
a
) being 
assembled by means of a screw (7) perpendicular to said flat 

surface, with a view to being able to adjust their relative 
position by pivoting with res
pect to the axis of this screw.  
 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the sides of the projecting part (4) 

are inclined with respect to the flat surface against which 
the edge of the recess (5) forming the trough rests in such a 

way as to be able to slide. 
A system according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the projecting part (4) is in the form of an inverted 

truncated pyramid, that is to say one whose larger base is 
remote from the flat part against which rests the edge of the 

recess (5) forming a trough. 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the edge of the trough rests with at least a first 

cylindrical surface against at least a second cylindrical 
surface of complementary profile on the element with which 

the projecting part is firmly connected, said first and 
second cylindrical surfaces being arranged in such a way that 

they may slide pivotingly with respect to each other. 
An assembly system according to claim 6, this device 
comprising a first element (11), capable of being firmly 

connected with a first component of a prosthesis, and a 
second element (12), capable of being firmly connected with a 

second component of the prosthesis, an intermediate element 
(13), capable of being firmly connected, in an adjustable 

position, respectively with the first and second elements 
through the cooperation of a male part and/or a female part 

respectively of this intermediate element with a female part 
and/or a male part of the first and second elements, assembly 

members such as screws being provided to lock with respect to 
each other, in a plurality of positions, on the one hand the 

first element and the intermediate element and on the other 
hand the second element and the intermediate element, this 

device being characterised in that each of said male parts 
comprises a portion in the form of a rectangular-based 

truncated pyramid (16, 17) projecting from a cylindrically 
shaped portion (14, 15) to which it is connected by its small 

base, the axis of the cylindrical portion being substantially 
parallel with two sides of the base of the associated  

 
truncated pyramid, while each female part comprises a portion 

(18, 20) complementary in shape to the cylindrical element 
and a recessed portion in the form of a groove (19, 21) 

capable of receiving the portion (16, 17) of the associated 
male element in the form of a truncated pyramid, the groove 

having dimensions greater than those of the portion in the 
form of a truncated pyramid in parallel with the axis of the 

cylindrical portion and perpendicularly thereto, in such a 
way as to provide double freedom of movement, in the form of 

rotation with respect to this axis and translation in 
parallel with this axis, of the male portion with respect to 

the associated female portion, the cylindrical parts (14, 15) 
associated with each of the first and second elements further 

having axes which are not parallel and are preferably 
perpendicular to each other. 
A system according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the intermediate (13) comprises two male parts (14, 16; 15, 

17), each associated with two female parts (18, 19; 20, 21) 
of the first and second elements (11, 12). 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the intermediate element (43) comprises two female parts (46, 

47; 50, 51) associated respectively with two male parts (44, 
45; 48, 49) of the first and second elements (41, 42). 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the intermediate element (66) comprises a male part (64, 65) 

and a female part (67, 68) respectively associated with a 
female part (62, 63) and a male part (69, 70) of the first 

and second elements (61, 71). 
A system according to any one of claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that the intermediate member (3'; 43') 

comprises two parts (3'
a
, 3'
b
; 43'

cylindrical surface, these two parts being assembled by a
