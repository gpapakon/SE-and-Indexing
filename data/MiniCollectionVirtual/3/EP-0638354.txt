<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multiaxial mixer/reactor having a large free usable volume which is dynamically self-cleaning, comprising two or more parallel contrarotating axles (1, 11) on which are mounted transport paddles (2, 12), offset in a screw-like manner, which transport paddles are connected together by axially extended kneading bars (3, 13) and also comprising a surrounding housing (4) and an inlet (5) and an outlet (6) for the material to be mixed.

<CLAIMS>
Mixer or reactor with two or more parallel rotors (1,
2, 3 or 11, 12, 13), with a drive means for rotation

of adjacent rotors in opposite directions, consisting
of shafts (1, 11), on which are mounted, helically

offset, feed blades (2, 12) which are connected to one
other by means of axially extended kneading bars (3,

13), and consisting of a surrounding casing (4) with
an inlet (5) and an outlet (6) for a material to be

mixed, characterised

in that the front and rear sides, viewed in the axial
direction, of each feed blade (2, 12) of a rotor (1,

2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) are so designed that in the event
of rotation of the rotors brought about by the drive

means they are fully swept by edges and/ or surfaces
of the feed blades (12, 2) of another rotor

(11, 12, 13 or 1, 2, 3), with the exception of the
surfaces of the feed blades (12, 2) that in the event

of rotation of the rotors (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) are
swept by the front wall of the casing;
in that the kneading bars (3, 13) of a rotor (1, 2, 3
or 11, 12, 13) are so designed that in the event of

rotation of the rotors brought about by the drive
means their surfaces are fully swept by edges and/or

surfaces of the kneading bars (13, 3) and of the shaft
(11, 1) of another rotor (11, 12, 13 or 1, 2, 3) and

are also swept at the ends, viewed in the axial
direction of the rotor (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13), by

surfaces and/or edges of the feed blades (12, 2) of
the other rotor (11, 12, 13 or 1, 2, 3); 
in that the shaft (1, 11) of a rotor (1, 2, 3 or 11,
12, 13) is so designed that in the event of rotation

of the rotors brought about by the drive means its
surfaces are swept by edges and/or surfaces of the

feed blades (12, 2) and of the kneading bars (13, 3)
of the other rotor (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13);
in that the inner wall of the casing (4) is so
designed that in the event of rotation of the rotors

(1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) brought about by the drive
means it is fully swept by edges and/or surfaces of

the kneading bars (3, 13) and feed blades (2, 12);
in that the cutting edges of feed blades (2, 12) and
kneading bars (3, 13) arising in a radial section of a

rotor (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) are all either arcs of a
circle about the centre of rotation or epicycloid

sections;
in that the cutting edges of feed blades (2, 12) and
kneading bars (3, 13) arising in a radial section of a

rotor (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) are all concave when
they point inward; and,
in that each feed blade (2, 12) is connected, except
at the ends of the mixer on the front and rear sides,

viewed in the axial direction, to a respective
kneading bar (3, 13), whereby the kneading bar located

upstream in relation to the axial feed by means of the
feed blades (2, 12) is connected to that end of the

feed blade which leads in the course of rotation and
the other kneading bar is connected to that end of the

feed blade which trails in the course of rotation.
Mixer or reactor according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the rotors (1, 2, 3 or 11, 12, 13) are

connected to a drive means for rotation of the rotors

adjacent kneading bars of a rotor is determined by the

Σ
l
l

cooling medium is provided, from which a line for
heating or cooling medium is guided through the

respective first feed blade of a series of feed blades
