<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic hysteresis clutch comprises an external rotor 
(70) and a rotary magnetic inductor (58) arranged in said 

external rotor (70) so as to define a radial air gap (78). 
Rings (80, 81, 82, 83) of ferromagnetic hysteresis material 

are mounted in said external rotor (70) so as to be able to 
undergo a reversible thermal expansion of their internal 

diameter leading to an increase in the radial air gap (78). 
The clutch is designed so that the heating up of the 

ferromagnetic material in the rings (80, 81, 82, 83), which 
accompanies an increase of the slip between the external 

rotor (70) and the rotary magnetic inductor (58), produces a 
reversible increase in the radial air gap (78) which is 

sufficient to decrease the transmitted torque. Thus it is 
possible to provide a magnetic hysteresis clutch in which 

the transmitted torque reversibly decreases when the slip 
increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic hysteresis 
clutch or coupling device. More particularly, it relates to a magnetic hysteresis 
clutch comprising an external rotor supporting a 
ferromagnetic hysteresis material and a rotary magnetic 
inductor arranged in the external rotor so as to define a 
radial air gap delimited on the outside by the ferromagnetic 
hysteresis material. The slip between the magnetic inductor 
and the ferromagnetic hysteresis material is varying between 
a minimum value (V1) and a maximum value (V2). The coupling 
between the magnetic inductor and the magnetic armature 
takes place by magnetization and demagnetization of the 
ferromagnetic hysteresis material which is in relative 
rotation with respect to the magnetic field. These magnetic hysteresis clutches are used to transmit a 
torque from an input shaft of the clutch to an output shaft 
of the clutch in the case where there are significant 
differences between the speed of rotation of the input shaft 
and the speed of rotation of the output shaft of the clutch. A typical application of these magnetic hysteresis clutches 
is found in a reeling-in/reeling-out device delivering a 
reeling-in torque and a braking torque during reeling-out. In such a device, the input shaft of the clutch is coupled 
to the drive motor which has a nearly constant speed of 
rotation. The output shaft of the clutch is coupled to a 
reeling-in/reeling-out drum. The speed of rotation of the  
 
reeling-in/reeling-out drum passes through zero and changes 
sense, whereas the speed of rotation of the motor is 
substantially constant. If the modulus of the maximum speed 
of rotation of the output shaft of the clutch represents 50% 
of the modulus of the speed of rotation of the input shaft 
of the clutch, both during the reeling-out operation and 
during the reeling-in operation, the slip between the 
magnetic inductor and the magnetic armature of the clutch 
increases by 200% between the reeling-in operation and the 
reeling-out operation. This is because, during the reeling-in 
operation, the output shaft of the clutch rotates in the 
same direction as the input shaft, whereas, during the 
reeling-out operation, the output shaft of the clutch 
rotates in the opposite direction to that of the input 
shaft. In a conventional magnetic hysteresis clutch, the torque 
transmitted increases with the slip between the magnetic 
inductor and the magnetic armature. This phenomenon is due 
to the fact that the magnetic field rotating with respect to 
the
