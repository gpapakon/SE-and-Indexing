<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to N-heteroaryl-N'-phenylurea
derivatives or pharmacologically acceptable
salts thereof, which have inhibitory effect on
acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT).The compounds of the present invention have
the effect of reducing serum cholesterol by inhibiting
the absorption of cholesterol from intestinal tract and
suppress the accumulation of cholesterol esters in the
arterial wall. Therefore, they are useful as a prophylactic
and therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia,
atherosclerosis and various diseases caused by them (for
example, ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial
infarction, and cerebrovascular diseases such as
cerebral infarction and cerebral apoplexy).As to N-heteroaryl-N'-phenylurea derivatives,
there are the following disclosures.Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 3-7259
discloses that N-quinoline-N'-phenylurea derivatives
represented by the formula (A): 

(wherein the ring A, ring B and ring C may have a
substituent, and each of m and n is zero or an integer
of 1) have ACAT-inhibitory activity. Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 3-223254 discloses that N-quinoline-N'-phenylurea
derivatives represented by the
formula (B):

(wherein the ring A', ring B' and ring C' may have a
substituent, n is zero or an integer of 1, and X' is

have ACAT-inhibibtory
activity.J. Ind. Chem. Soc., 1978, 55(9), 910-913
discloses that compounds having, like the compounds of 
the present invention, a benzofuran skeleton which are
represented by the formula (C):

(wherein Re is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group) have
antimicrobial activity, antibacterial activity, anti-parasitic
activity and anti-amoeba activity.Farmaco, Ed. Sci. 1979, 34(6), 507-517
describes compounds having an indole skeleton which are
represented by the formula (D):

but it does not describe them as having ACAT-inhibitory
activity.EP-A-0 399 422 discloses a benzocycloalkane derivative having
acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibiting
activity represented by the following formula 

wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue, which may optionally have one or more
substituents, Ar is an aromatic group, X is an oxygen or sulfur atom, ℓ is 0 or 1, m is 3 to 6 and n is 0 to 2,
wherein the ring A and the group Ar each may optionally have one or more substituents, with the proviso
that compounds are excluded, wherein Ar is

whereby Rx and Ry are independently selected from alkyl or alkoxy of from one to seven carbon atoms, or
its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.An
