<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for enhancing the quality of printing on cotton-containing fabrics. Specifically, these methods disclosed herein recite the pretreatment of cotton-containing fabrics with cellulase prior to printing in order to enhance printing characteristics on the fabric such as pigment uptake, enhanced clarity, reduced pigment bleeding, and the like. The methods disclosed herein generally entail treating cotton-containing fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation and preferably with an aqueous cellulase solution under agitating conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to methods for enhancing 
the quality of printing on resinated and non-resinated 
cotton fabrics using a colorant composition containing a 
pigment. Specifically, this invention is directed to 
methods of pretreating resinated and non-resinated 
cotton fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation 
prior to printing an image onto the fabric with a 
pigment composition so as to enhance printing qualities 
on the fabric such as pigment uptake. The methods 
disclosed herein generally entail treating cotton 
fabrics with an aqueous cellulase formulation followed 
by drying the fabrics and then printing an image onto 
the fabrics with a pigment composition. Aesthetic and/or informational images are often 
placed on cotton fabrics with dye or pigment 
compositions by methods such as silk screening, 
painting, etc. While such methodology is well known in 
the art, these methods entail numerous problems which 
must be overcome in order to impart and retain quality 
images on cotton fabrics. Specifically, common with 
such printing methods is the low level of pigment uptake 
exhibited by some cotton fabrics. In general, the level 
of pigment uptake relates to the degree by which the 
pigment is incorporated (penetrates) into the fabric and 
can be indirectly measured by the number of passes 
required for sufficient amounts of the pigment  
 
composition to be incorporated into the cotton fabric to 
provide adequate resolution of the intended image. For 
some cotton fabrics, three passes are required to 
provide the desired level of pigment uptake. However, 
the use of numerous passes to ensure adequate pigment 
uptake poses problems such as ensuring that the second 
and additional passes are placed identically over the 
image created from the first pass so that blurring of 
the image does not occur. Still another problem encountered with the 
methodology used for imparting an image onto a cotton 
fabric with a pigment composition is the level of 
adherence of the pigment composition to the fabric. 
Such adherence relates to the level of pigment 
incorporation into the fabric after fabric washing. 
Fabrics having low pigment adherence will exhibit 
reduced pigment retention after washing. In any event, these problems impart a significant 
impediment to providing high quality cotton fabrics 
having images painted or silk-screened thereon with a 
pigment composition. The present invention is directed to the discovery 
that pretreating cotton fabrics with an aqueous 
cellulase formulation,

<CLAIMS>
A method for printing an image onto a cotton-containing fabric 
with a pigment composition which method comprises the steps of: 


a) contacting a cotton-containing fabric with an aqueous cellulase 
formulation comprising at least about 50 ppm of cellulase proteins selected 

from the group consisting of exo-cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, and β-glucosidase 
components, at a temperature of from about 25°C to about 70°C for 

at least 0.1 hours, wherein the aqueous formulation is maintained at a pH 
where the cellulase proteins have activity; 
b) drying the fabric; and 
c) printing an image on the fabric with a pigment composition, 
wherein said cotton-containing fabric is made from fibers selected from the 

group consisting of pure cotton and cotton blends comprising cotton and 
non-cotton fibers, wherein at least 40 weight percent of the cotton-containing 

material is cotton and the non-cotton fiber is a synthetic 
fiber.

concentration in said aqueous formulation is from about 100 ppm cellulase 

to about 2000 ppm cellulase. 
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the 
cellulase formulation is maintained at a temperature from 35° to 60°C for a period of time 

from about 0.25 to 2.5 hours.

formulation is an aqueous cellulase solution which is agitated during 

contact with the cotton-containing fabric.

derived from a fungal source. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the cellulase is a 
complete fungal cellulase composition. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the aqueous cellulase 
composition is maintained at a pH with ±1 pH unit of the pH at which the 

cellulase composition possesses maximal activity. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims which, after step (a), further 
comprises the step of inactivating the cellulase from the cotton-containing 

fabric. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein the step of

with drying step (b) by heating the fabric at a temperature of at least 
75°C for at least 10 minutes. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein the step of 
inactivating the cellulase from the cotton-containing fabric is a separate 

step conducted after step (a) and prior to step (b).  
 
The method of Claim 10 wherein the separate step of 
inactivating the cellulase from the cotton-containing fabric is conducted 

by washing the fabric with water maintained at a temperature of at least
