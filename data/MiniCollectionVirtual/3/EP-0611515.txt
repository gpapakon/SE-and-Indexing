<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for processing a short message received at a mobile exchange in a cellular radio network, and to a mobile exchange (MSC) in a cellular radio system, comprising a short message delivery means (13) for delivering one short message at a time to a B subscriber (MS); a means (9) for observing the operation of the B subscriber so as to detect the delivery of the short message and to prevent the delivery of another short message when the delivery of the preceding short message is in progress; a memory means (11) for storing rejected short messages; and a queue control means (10) responsive to the B-subscriber operation control means (9) for reading the rejected short message from the memory means (11) so as to initiate the delivery of the short message to the B subscriber when the delivery of the preceding short message is completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for processing
a short message received at a mobile exchange in a
cellular radio network when the short message is
received while a preceding short message is being
delivered from the mobile exchange to a B subscriber;
and to a mobile exchange in a cellular radio system,
comprising a short message delivery means for delivering
one short message at a time to a B subscriber; a
means for observing the operation of the B subscriber
so as to detect the delivery of the short message and
to prevent the delivery of another short message when
the delivery of the preceding short message is in
progress.It is known in cellular radio networks to send
short messages via a short message service centre (SC)
separate from the cellular radio network. One system
for sending and forwarding short messages is described
in GSM 03.40, February 1992, Technical Realization of
Short Message Services Point to Point, ETSI/PT. The
specification describes the interfacing of a short
message service centre (SC) to the mobile exchange of
a cellular radio network and the operation of the
short message service centre when the centre sends and
forwards short messages from outside the cellular
radio network and from one subscriber (A subscriber)
to another (B subscriber) in the cellular radio
network, or to an external message means capable of
receiving and/or sending short messages. The transfer
of short messages over a radio path between GSM
terminal equipments, a mobile exchange and a short
message service centre is described more closely in
GSM 04.11, February 1992, MS-BSS Interface - Support
of Short Message Service (p-p), ETSI/PT 12. When the short message service centre attempts
to send a short message to the B subscriber, and the B
subscriber is not reachable, a message waiting data
list is included in the home location register (HLR)
in compliance with GSM 03.40. The list stores for each
B subscriber the addresses of the short message
centres SC storing short messages to be forwarded to
the B subscribers. Accordingly, when the B subscriber
is connected to the network, i.e. a short message can
be sent to the mobile radio of the B subscriber, the
visitor location register (VLR) within the area of
which the B subscriber is registered sends an indication
of the reappearance of the B subscriber in the
network to the HLR of the B subscriber. The HLR of the
B subscriber thereby starts to send alert messages to
the short message service centres included in the subscribers's
message waiting data list so as

<CLAIMS>
Method for processing a short message received
at a mobile exchange (MSC) in a cellular radio

network when the short message is received while a
preceding short message is being delivered from the

mobile exchange (MSC) to a B subscriber (4), 
characterized

in that the short message received
during the delivery of the preceding short message is

stored in a memory (11) and delivered from the mobile
exchange (MSC) to the B subscriber (MS 4) after the

completion of the delivery of the preceding short
message from the mobile exchange (MSC) to the B subscriber

(MS 4).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the short message received
during the delivery of the preceding short message is

stored in the memory (11) so that the short message to
be stored in the memory (11) is assigned an identity

code, and that the short message is searched from the
memory (11) on the basis of the identity code and

delivered from the mobile exchange (MSC) to the B
subscriber after the completion of the delivery of the

preceding short message from the mobile exchange (MSC)
to the B subscriber (MS).
Method according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized

in that the short messages are
stored in the memory separately for each subscriber.
Mobile exchange (MSC) in a cellular radio
system, comprising


a short message delivery means (13) for
delivering one short message at a time to a B subscriber

(MS, 4);
a means (9) for observing the operation of the
B subscriber (4) so as to detect the delivery of the 

short message and to prevent the delivery of another
short message when the delivery of the preceding short

message is in progress;
characterized
 in that the mobile exchange
(MSC) further comprises:


a memory means (11) for storing rejected short
messages; and
a queue control means (10) responsive to the B
subscriber operation control means (9) for reading the

rejected short message from the memory means (11) so
as to initiate the delivery of the short message to

the B subscriber (4) when the delivery of the preceding
short message is completed.
Mobile exchange according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the delivery of the short
message to the B subscriber is initiated by calling

the short message delivery means (13) by means of its
process identity code.
