<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor memory device having first and 
second main data amplifiers (27, 28) for electrically 

charging a plurality of read bus pairs (23, 24), a 
precharge control circuit (26) controls operation of 

first and second main data amplifiers so that selected 
ones of the read bus pairs are electrically charged 

during a predetermined burst period except when each of 
the first and the second main data amplifiers produces a 

difference signal. When each of the read bus pairs has a 
read bus potential difference, each of the first and the 

second main data amplifiers produces the difference 
signal and electrically charges each of the read bus 

pairs in accordance with the difference signal. The read 
bus potential difference is produced dependent on a bit 

line potential difference which is produced in each of 
bit line pairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device such as a synchronous dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) and, in particular, to control a state of data
readout routes through which data are read out from
memory cells.With a recent development of a microprocessing
unit (MPU), there arises a strong demand for a
semiconductor memory device of a high speed. As one
approach therefor, proposal has been made of a
synchronous DRAM which is operable in synchronism with an
external clock supplied from an external source.In the manner which will later be discussed in
detail with reference to a drawing, a conventional
synchronous DRAM comprises a period determining
arrangement, a plurality of memory cells, a plurality of
word lines, a plurality of bit line pairs, a first
processing arrangement, a plurality of read bus pairs,
and a second processing arrangement. The period
determining arrangement is for determining a burst
period. The word lines are connected to the memory
cells. The bit line pairs are connected to the memory 
cells. Each of the bit line pairs comprises two bit
lines having a bit line potential difference
therebetween. The first processing arrangement is
connected to the bit line pairs and is for processing the
bit line potential difference into a first difference
signal. The read bus pairs are connected to the first
processing arrangement and supplied with the first
difference signal. Each of the read bus pairs comprises
two read buses having a read bus potential difference
therebetween. The second processing arrangement is
connected to the read bus pairs and is for processing the
read bus potential difference into a second difference
signal.The conventional synchronous DRAM further
comprises a precharge circuit for carrying out a
precharge operation to precharge each of the read bus
pairs in response to necessity in the manner known in the
art. In the precharge operation, each of the read bus
pairs is electrically charged, amplified, and discharged
in every one cycle having a cycle time. This results in
a large consumption of charging/discharging current of
each of the read bus pairs. Particularly when the cycle
time is shortened, the charging/discharging current
generates a noise on a power supply line and on a ground
line in the manner known in the art.Another prior art example is disclosed in
JP-A-02294991. In the 
prior art example, selected ones of data readout routes
are continuously and electrically charged for a
predetermined time period. However, it is impossible to
apply the
