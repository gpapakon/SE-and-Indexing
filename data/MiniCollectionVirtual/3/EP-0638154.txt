Valve (1) for controlling a fluid medium flowing under pressure 
with inlet opening (6) and outlet opening, with an entry piece (4) 

through which the medium flows axially, with a sleeve-shaped control 
piece (13) axially moveable relative to the entry piece (4) between a 

closed and an open position, with a first radially projecting elastic 
sealing ring (24b) and a first annular sealing edge (25) which in the 

closed position of the control piece (13) can be sealingly pressed 
against the first sealing ring (24b), wherein the moveable control 

piece (13) is surrounded by a valve housing (2) and the space between 
the control piece (13) and the valve housing (2) admits the fluid 

medium flowing under pressure, so that essentially no resulting 
pressure is applied on the control piece (13) in the axial direction 

and that the control piece is moveable without substantial effort, a 
second radially projecting elastic sealing ring (26b) is provided at an 

axial separation from the first sealing ring (24b) and a second annular 
sealing edge (27) can be sealingly pressed against the second sealing 

ring (26b) in the closed position of the control piece, characterized 
in that the first and second annular sealing edges (25, 27) are formed 

to be relatively sharp and cutter-like and in the closed position of 
the valve they form a continuous circular sealing region between the 

first and second sealing rings (24b, 26b) on the one hand and the first 
and second sealing edges (25, 27) on the other hand. 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that of the two 

sealing rings (24b, 26b) on the valve one is stationary and the other 
is formed to be moveable with the control slide (13), a sealing edge 

(25) moveable with the control slide (13) is coordinated with the 
stationary sealing ring (24b) and a stationary sealing edge (27) is 

coordinated with the moveable sealing ring (26b) (Fig. 1-3; 4;5). 
Valve according to claim 2, characterized in that the first 
sealing ring (24b) is formed stationary on the entry piece (4), the 

first sealing edge (25) is formed on the moveable control piece (13), 
the second sealing ring (26b) is formed on the moveable control piece  

 
(13) and the second sealing edge (27) is formed stationary on the 

entry piece (4) (Fig 1-3). 
Valve according to claim 2, characterized in that the first 
sealing ring (24b) is formed stationary on the entry piece (4), the 

first sealing edge (26) is formed on the moveable control piece (13), 
the second sealing ring (26b) is formed on the moveable control piece 

(13) and the second sealing edge (27) is formed stationary on cover 
plate (9) joined to the valve housing (2) and surrounding the outlet 

opening (12) (Fig 4). 
Valve according to claim 2, characterized in that the first 
sealing ring (24b) is formed on the moveable control piece (13), the 

first sealing edge (25) is formed on the valve housing (2), the second 
sealing ring (26b) is formed stationary on a cover plate (9) joined to 

the valve housing (2) and surrounding the outlet opening (2) and the 
second sealing edge (27) is formed on the moveable control piece (13) 

(Fig 5). 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the two sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are formed stationary on the valve (1) and one sealing 

edge (25, 27) moveable with the control slide (13) is coordinated with 
each sealing ring (24b, 26b) (Fig. 6). 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the two sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are formed moveable with control slide (13) and a 

stationary sealing edge (25, 27) is coordinated with each sealing ring 
(24b, 26b) (Fig 7). 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that in an 
intermediate space (21a) limited at the front end by the sealing rings 

(24b, 26b) and filled with fluid medium, in the closed position both 
sealing rings (24b, 26b) can be sealingly pressed substantially 

simultaneously against their respective sealing edges (25, 27).  
 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are arranged projecting radially from circumferential 

grooves (24a, 24b). 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are O-rings with at least partially round 

cross-sectional shape. 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are O-rings with at least partially angular 

cross-sectional shape. 
Valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing 
rings are formed as metallic projections. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the sealing 
rings (24b, 26b) are formed as annular plastics projections. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the outer 
circumferential surface of the sleeve-shaped control piece (13) there 

is a groove (14) running circumferentially, in which groove a drive 
member (16) engages to move the control piece (13).
