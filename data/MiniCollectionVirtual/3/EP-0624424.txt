<ABSTRACT>
A rotating polygon mirror (4) deflects a continuous 
laser beam, applying the deflected beam to a beam-splitting 

mirror (8) through a focusing lens (6) which 
functions as an fϑ lens. The beam is applied to the two 

reflective surfaces of the mirror (8) alternately. As a 
result, the mirror (8) splits the beam into two beams, 

which are applied to two beam-splitting mirrors (13) and 
(14), respectively. The mirrors (13, 14) split the 

input beams, each into two segment beams. The four segment 
beams are focused by lenses (15, 16), lenses (17, 

18), lenses (19, 20), and lenses (21, 22), respectively, 
onto the surface of a web sheet (27), forming beam 

spots. The beam spots move in the same direction and at 
the same speed as the web sheet (27), thus scanning a 

limited surface regions of the sheet (27). As a result, 
rows of perforations, each being a truly circular hole, 

are formed in the web sheet (27).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
boring perforations in a web sheet such as tipping paper 
sheet, and more particularly, to an apparatus which can 
bore in a web sheet perforations of a uniform shape at 
high speed. Various apparatuses are known which bore perforations 
in a rolled paper sheet or a web sheet such as 
a tipping paper sheet. In these apparatuses, a 
pulsating laser beam is used to form a number of perforations 
having a uniform shape and an accurate pattern 
in a rolled paper sheet or a web sheet such as a tipping 
paper sheet. Various methods are available for converting 
a laser beam into a pulsative one. Among them 
are: (1) pulse beam oscillation method; (2) slit method; 
(3) chopper method, (4) shutter method, i.e., beam 
scanning method, and high-speed polygon mirror method. In the pulse beam oscillator method, a carbon 
dioxide gas laser, which generates a pulsating laser 
beam, is usually employed as laser beam source. This is 
because the pulsating laser beam the laser generates has 
a wavelength of 10 µm which can be optimally absorbed 
into the water contained in a web sheet. At present, 
the carbon dioxide gas laser is considered to be more 
suited for boring perforations in paper than any other 
types of a laser hitherto developed. This laser, 
however, requires hundreds of microseconds to increase  
 
the beam energy from the zero level to the highest level 
and decrease it back to the zero level. Consequently, 
the laser cannot generates beam pulses at sufficiently 
short time intervals. Hence, there are limits to the 
speed at which a boring apparatus incorporating the carbon 
dioxide gas laser can bore perforations in a web 
sheet. More specifically, the maximum speed is no more 
than 2 mm/sec for perforations arranged at pitch of 
1 mm, and the boring efficiency is relatively low. In the slip method, a slit member having a row of 
slits is moved, along with a paper sheet located below 
the slit member, while a continuous laser beam converged 
by a lens system is being applied to the slit member. 
As a result, beams are applied through the slits onto 
the paper sheet, thereby forming perforations in the 
paper sheet. Since it suffices for the laser to emit 
a continuous beam, not a pulsative beam as in the pulse 
beam oscillation method, perforations can be formed in 
the paper sheet at a higher speed, e.g., 6 mm/sec, and 
hence, at a lower cost than in the case where the pulse 
beam method is employed. The slit method, however, is 
disadvantageous in
