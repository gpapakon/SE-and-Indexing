<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic resonance apparatus including a transducer (25, 31) positioned in 
the examination region of the apparatus, the transducer is connected with equipment (49) 

outside the examination region by way of a lead (47) which is grounded (51, 53) to signals 
of the frequency of the RF field applied to a subject (5) in the examination region to excite 

magnetic resonance in the subject, at a distance along the lead from the transducer equal 
to a quarter waveleng
th at the RF field frequency (or an odd multiple thereof). Distortion 
of the RF field due to loading by the transducer is thereby reduced. The transducer may, 

for example, be a microphone or loudspeaker, e.g. incorporated in an intercom or active 
noise reduction arrangement, or a sensor for sensing a condition of a patient being 

examined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance apparatus.Such apparatus can be used for non-invasive internal examinations of patients to
produce, for example, cross-sectional internal structural images, and blood flow and
spectroscopy data.In use of such apparatus the part of the patient to be examined is placed in a region
of strong static magnetic field to define an equilibrium axis of magnetic alignment in the
examination region. A radio frequency (RF) magnetic field is then applied temporarily
to the examination region, in a direction orthogonal to the static magnetic field direction,
to excite magnetic resonance in material, typically hydrogen protons, in the examination
region. The resulting RF signals are detected and analysed. During this sequence of
operations one or more gradients are normally imposed on the static magnetic field in the
examination region, e.g. to encode spatially the detected RF signals, or for other purposes
such as flow encoding.In use of such apparatus it is sometimes required to dispose a transducer in the
examination region, the transducer being connected to equipment outside the examination
region by a lead. Examples of such transducers are microphones and loudspeakers for
communication between a patient being examined and a person, e.g. medical staff outside
the apparatus, microphones and loudspeakers of an active noise reduction system for
reducing disturbance of the patient by noise produced in the magnetic field systems
surrounding the patient, and sensors for sensing the condition of the patient e.g.
thermometers, and heart rate and respiratory monitors.One problem which arises with such transducers is that they tend to load the RF 
fields produced in the examination region, thereby distorting the RF fields and
degrading the data obtained by analysing the detected RF signals.It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic resonance
apparatus wherein this problem is alleviated.According to the present invention there is provided a magnetic resonance
apparatus including means arranged to emit an RF field of a predetermined frequency to
excite a magnetic resonance in a patient to be examined and a transducer having a lead
connected thereto, wherein the transducer and the end of the lead adjacent to the
transducer are disposed in a region of said RF field, characterised in that the lead is
grounded to signals of the frequency of said RF field by way of a filter tuned to said
frequency at a distance along the lead from said end which is equal to a quarter
