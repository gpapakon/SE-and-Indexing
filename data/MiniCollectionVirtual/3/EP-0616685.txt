<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a slide assembly, especially an 
assembly which provides precision guidance of a sliding member. Highly accurate and low-friction guidance of sliding elongate 
members is necessary in many different types of machine or instrument, of 
which a three-dimensional co-ordinate measuring machine can be considered 
to be a representative example. Co-ordinate measuring requires movement 
of a measuring element relative to a stationary article, for example a 
sensor probe which contacts the article, and recording the movement of 
the element in relation to a reference point so as to build up a two-dimensional 
or three-dimensional measurement profile of the article. In 
a typical construction of such a measuring machine, a probe is carried by 
a square-, oblong- or circular-section spindle which is mounted in a 
carriage on a bridge movable relative to a support table for the article. 
Movement of the probe in the Z axis direction is by way of axial 
displacement of the spindle in the bearing mount on the carriage, 
movement in the Y axis direction is by way of displacement of the 
carriage on the bridge and movement in the X axis direction is by way of 
displacement of the bridge over the table. The accuracy of the 
measurements obtained from signals generated through co-operation of the 
probe with the article is critically dependent on the accuracy of the 
spindle displacement, in particular its travel along a precisely fixed 
axis. Any deviations from this axis will ultimately be reflected in the 
measurement result. In order to ensure precise and low-friction guidance of the spindle 
in such a measuring machine, it is common practice to construct the 
bearing mount for the spindle as an air bearing sleeve encasing a portion 
of the spindle. One example of this practice is illustrated in GB-A-2 
228 570, in which a cylindrical air bearing sleeve is divided into two 
axially spaced length portions which journal the spindle and are rigidly 
mounted on a carrier frame. The peripheral surface of the spindle and the 
guide passage of the sleeve or of each sleeve portion must be finished to 
a superaccurate standard of parallelism and uniformity of section, which 
imposes substantial costs on manufacturing of the assembly. Problems 
that can result from machining of the spindle surface and sleeve passage 
are local fluctuations in diameter or width and also gradual change  
 
resulting in a taper. If there are any such departures of the spindle 
and bore diameters or widths from
