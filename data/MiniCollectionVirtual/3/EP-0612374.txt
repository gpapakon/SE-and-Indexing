<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion engines is designed to inject an amount of additive between a preliminary amount and a main amount of injected fuel, so as to favourably influence the smoothness of operation and the course of the combustion. In order to ensure a reproducible separation of the amount of additive from both the preliminary and main amounts of fuel injected, the injection nozzle is provided with an intermediate chamber (26) for the liquid additive arranged in a nozzle body (1) between a pressure chamber (21) and a prechamber (25) for the main fuel. Throttling slots (28, 31) separate the intermediate chamber (26) from the prechamber (25) and from the pressure chamber (21) in the closing position of the valve needle (1), in which an amount of additive is fed into the intermediate chamber, displacing the main fuel into the pressure chamber (21). The additive is fed into the intermediate chamber (26) through an axial supply channel (36) and through radial bores (35) arranged in the nozzle needle (11).

Fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion
engines having additional injection of an additive

between pre-injection and main injection of the fuel,
with a nozzle body (1), in which a valve seat (17) is

formed in the end portion located on the combustion-space
side and a pressure space (21) is formed downstream

thereof, with a valve needle (11) which is mounted
displaceably in the nozzle body (1) and is loaded in the

closing direction and which has a sealing seat (12)
cooperating with the valve seat (17) and, level with the

pressure space (21), a pressure shoulder (13), with a
pre-space (25), arranged between the valve seat (17) and

the pressure space (21), for the pre-storage of a pre-injection
quantity, and with a fuel inflow duct (7)

leading to the pressure space (21) as well as with an
additive inflow duct (8) for the intermediate storage of

an additive quantity between the pre-injection quantity
and the main injection quantity, characterized in that

there is arranged between the pressure space (21) and the
pre-space (25) an interspace (26) which is delimited

radially by the valve needle (11) and by a lengthening
portion (22) of a longitudinal bore (9) of the nozzle

body (1), the said longitudinal bore axially guiding the
valve needle (11), the additive inflow duct (8) opening

into the said longitudinal bore which can be connected
via openable throttle points (28, 31) to the pressure

space (21) and to the pre-space (25) for the throughflow
of the main injection quantity, whilst, in the closing

position of the valve needle (11), with the connection of 
the interspace (26) to the pressure space (21) and to the

pre-space (25) being throttled, the inflowing quantity of
additive displaces the residual fuel located in the

interspace (26) into the pressure space (21), and whilst,
when the valve needle (11) lifts off from the valve seat

(17), the throttle effect between the interspace (26) and
the pressure space (21) as well as the interspace (26)

and the pre-space (25) is cancelled.
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the additive inflow duct (8) is

arranged partially in the valve needle (11) and opens
into the interspace (26) through radial bores (35).
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims
1 and 2, characterized in that the pre-space (25) and the

interspace (26) are formed by annular recesses (27, 24)
in the circumference of the nozzle needle (11) and are

separated from one another by a collar (33), the
circumference of which delimits one throttle point (31).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the radial bores (35) in the nozzle

needle (11) open into the interspace (26) at a point near
the collar (33).
