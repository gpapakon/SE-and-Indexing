<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new process for obtaining a completely pure oxytetracycline which does not contain any acetyldecarboxamidooxytetracycline as ingredient. In glacial acetic acid there is suspended under stirring oxytetracycline hydrochloride, or alternatively, oxytetracycline dihydrate under addition of an equimolar quantity of hydrogen chloride in the form of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The stirring is continued for 5 hours, the formed oxytetracycline hydrochloride acetate precipitate is filtered, washed with glacial acetic acid and acetone, whereupon it is dried under reduced pressure at a temperature up to 40  DEG C till constant weight. Oxytetracycline hydrochloride acetate of formula (III) is a new compound and may be used as intermediate in the above process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new process for obtaining a completely pure 
oxytetracycline with no acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline content, as well as to 
a new intermediate for the performance thereof. It has been known, that the fermentation of oxytetracycline of the following 
formula (I) yields as by-product also 3 - 12.5 % of 2-acetyl-2-decarboxamidoöxytetracycline 
(in the following text acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline) 
of the following formula II 
I   R=NH2II   R=CH3By using standard methods of isolation of oxytetracycline from the fermentation 
broth and the further purification thereof its content of acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline 
is only slightly reduced and is left as an impurity in the final 
product oxytetracycline. The presence of acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline as a 
by-product in oxytetracycline was demonstrated for the first time by 
chromatographic separation of these two compounds on a thin layer (Archiv der 
Pharmazie 300, 840/1967/). There were tested 15 samples of oxytetracycline of 
various producers of this antibiotic and the presence of acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline 
therein was qualitatively confirmed. Quantitatively, the content of 
acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline in oxytetracycline samples was defined by 
means of high pressure liquid chromatography (in the following text HPLC) 
(Journal of Chromatography 405, 229 /1987/). Acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline was obtained by fermentation even earlier. 
The substance was isolated and purified by counter-current distribution, and 
chemically identified (Journal of American Chemical Society 82, 5934 /1960/), 
and patented as antibiotic (US-Patent 3,022,347 /1962/). The investigation of 
biological activity of acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline on 33 microorganisms 
confirmed a similar antibacterial spectrum as in oxytetracycline, whereas, its 
potency did not reach even 10 % of that of oxytetracycline. Owing to the extreme similarity of the oxytetracycline and acetyldecarboxamidooxytetracycline 
molecules there has not been hitherto described 
any process for the isolation of oxytetracycline, which would be completely devoid 
of acetyldecarboxamidoöxytetracycline. It has been known as well that oxytetracycline forms molecular salt complexes 
with various organic acids and bases (JP-Patent No. 17 044 /63/; Chem. Abstr. 60 
2875 a). The crystal structure of some of these salts was determined by X-ray 
diffraction method (Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 36, 1163-8 /1963/). Molecular salt
