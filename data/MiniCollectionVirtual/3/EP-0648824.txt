<ABSTRACT>
Hot melt polyamide adhesive compositions are disclosed 
which exhibit long open assembly times. The polyamides are 

the condensation products of an acid component consisting 
essentially of a polymeric fatty acid and a dicarboxylic 

acid, and an amine component consisting essentially of a 
cyclic diamine, a non-cyclic aliphatic diamine selected 

from 1,3- diaminopropane and 1,3 diaminobutane and 
additional organic diamines comprising an alkylene diamine 

and optionally a further additional diamine such as a 
polyglycol diamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyamide compositions 
useful as hot-melt adhesives. One important property of adhesive compositions is 
their "open assembly time" or "open time". Open time is the 
maximum time a hot melt coated surface may be allowed to cool 
before bonding and still retain satisfactory adhesion. The 
open time required of a polyamide adhesive depends on the 
specific applications and can vary, for commercially 
available polyamide adhesives, from less than five seconds to 
about fifty-five seconds. There are many disclosures in the art relating to 
polyamide compositions having hot-melt adhesive properties 
and the methods for preparing such compositions. A 
poly(ester-amide) adhesive composition having a long open 
assembly time is disclosed in U.S. 4,485,233. This patent 
discloses poly(ester-amide) adhesive compositions comprising 
the product of polymerization of (a) from 10 to 60 equivalent 
percent of a polymeric fatty acid, and (b) from 40 to 90 
equivalent percent of a dicarboxylic acid, with a 
substantially equivalent amount of (c) from 40 to 90 
equivalent percent of an organic diamine and (d) from 10 to 
60 equivalent percent of a diol. The organic diamine  
 
component (c) may comprise a linear aliphatic, cycloaliphatic 
or aromatic diamine, and, disclosed as the preferred 
diamines, are piperazine, 1,3-dipiperidyl propane and 
diamines with an odd number of carbon atoms such as 1,3-diaminopropane. Representative of other prior art adhesive 
compositions are those described in U.S. Patents 3,377,303 
and 3,444,026. The latter compositions comprise the reaction 
product of a dimer fatty acid and a wide variety of diamines. 
Copolymerizing dicarboxylic acids, including aliphatic 
dicarboxylic acids such as adipic, sebacic and azelaic acids, 
are also disclosed as components of the adhesive 
compositions. FR-A-1581969 also refers to polyamide compositions 
which may be suitable for use as adhesives. Compositions 
are described which comprise a fatty acid polymer, 1-amino-3-aminomethyl-3.5.5.-trimethyl 
cyclohexane and a diamine 
such as alkylene diamine. Polyamide compositions useful as hot-melt adhesives 
for adhering vinyl plastics are also disclosed in U.S. 
3,847,875. The latter compositions are the reaction product 
of 1,8 or 1,9-heptadecane dicarboxylic acid and specific 
heterocyclic diamines such as piperazine. Copolymerizable 
dicarboxylic acids such as azelaic, sebacic and adipic acids 
are also disclosed as components of the adhesives.  GB-A-2173809 discloses an
