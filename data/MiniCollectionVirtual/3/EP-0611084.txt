<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic structures and, more particularly to such 
structures in the form of hollow, bodies within which a substantially uniform, 
longitudinal magnetic field can be produced for use especially in a variety of 
vacuum gauges, for example in gauges of the cold cathode ionisation type 
which are sometimes referred to as "Penning" gauges. In cold cathode ionisation gauges of the inverted magnetron type in particular, 
they generally comprise a rod-like anode surrounded by a substantially 
cylindrical cathode with a substantial magnetic field present between the 
anode and the cathode supplied by an external permanent magnet. In use a large potential difference (several kilovolts) is applied between the 
anode and the cathode; gas molecules present in the gauge are ionised and 
the resulting ions and electrons are accelerated towards the cathode and 
anode respectively and may ionise other molecules by collision. In addition 
further free electrons are produced when the ions bombard the cathode. The ion current found in this manner within the gauge is measured and is 
proportional to the pressure in the gauge. It is important in such gauges for the magnetic field to be present running 
essentially parallel to the anode so that the electrons adopt a very long, 
non-linear trajectory, for example helical, before striking the anode; as such 
the probability of ionisation of gas molecules present in the vacuum to which 
the gauge is attached by collision with the electrons is greatly increased even 
at relatively low pressures. The magnet field is commonly produced by providing a cylindrical magnet 
around the vacuum gauge anode and cathode with its polarity axially or 
longitudinally directed, ie. with a north pole at one end of the cylinder and a 
south pole at the other end. This generally provides the necessary axial or  
 
longitudinal magnetic field within gauge cathode but generally suffers from 
the disadvantage that magnetic field is also present externally of the gauge. The present invention is concerned with the provision of a magnetic structure 
for use in such gauges in which such disadvantages are minimised. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a magnetic structure for use 
in vacuum gauges, especially ones of the cold cathode ionisation type, which 
comprise a sheath of ferromagnetic material within which are held a first and a 
second magnetic array, each array: 
having a plurality of magnet components to form the complete array being magnetised such
