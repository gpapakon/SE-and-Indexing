<ABSTRACT>
The plug socket having differential-current protection (residual-current protection) contains a housing (8, 9), in the form of a box, for accommodating a differential-current protective circuit breaker (residual-current device) and a socket part. The socket part contains plug contacts (21, 22, 23) for a plug of an electrical load (V), and connecting terminals (11, 12, 13) for conductors (L3, PEN) of an electrical power supply network. The differential-current protective circuit breaker and the socket part are plugged together from modular units which are held together by insertion into the housing (8, 9). Such a plug socket is distinguished by the fact that it is of compact design and can be assembled (installed) and maintained (serviced) extremely easily. At the same time, a plug socket which is matched to a plug of modified design can be produced from such a plug socket at very low cost by replacement of modular units (for example the plug contact part 2 and the cover 9).

that the housing has a box-shaped housing part (8), which 

forms the rear side of the socket outlet together with a 
housing floor (81), and a cover (9) which forms the front 

side of the socket outlet and has openings (93, 94, 97)

well as for operating elements (61, test key 751) of the 
socket outlet. 
Socket outlet according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that seated on the housing floor (81)
 as a further 
modular unit is a carrying member (10) which is 

constructed predominantly in the shape of a plate and has

plugging-in and bearing the predominant number of the 

modular units. 
Socket outlet according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the supply terminals (11, 12, 13) as well as 

movable contact pieces (31, 32), contact springs (33, 
34), a compression spring (35) and a slide (36), latched 

with the breaker mechanism (6) of the contact arrangement 
(3) are plugged in on the side of the carrying member 

(10) seated on the housing floor (81), and the plug-in 
contact part (2), the summation current transformer (4), 

the magnetic tripping device (5) and the breaker 
mechanism (6) are plugged in on the side of the carrying 

member (10) facing the cover (9). 
Socket outlet according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the protective circuit (42) is plugged into the 

plug-in contact carrier (24). 
Socket outlet according to one of Claims 4 and 5,
