<ABSTRACT>
A patient support comprising a base (11), a support part (12) and a 
linkage to 

mount the support part (12) on the base (11) for movement up and down 
relative to the 

base (11), wherein the linkage comprises a pair of upper and lower 
links (18,19) pivotally 

connected at their one ends to the base (11) at vertically spaced 
positions and pivotally 

connected at their other ends to the support part (12) at vertically 
spaced positions, 

and drive means to cause the support part (12) to move up and down 
relative to the 

base (11) as a result of pivotal movement of the links (18,19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a patient support such as a hospital bed or chair. An object of the invention is to provide a new and improved patient 
support. According to one aspect of the invention, we provide a patient support 
comprising a base, a support part and a linkage to mount the support part on the 
base for movement up and down relative to the base, wherein the linkage 
comprises a pair of upper and lower links pivotally connected at their one ends 
to the base at vertically spaced positions and pivotally connected at their other 
ends to the support part at vertically spaced positions, and drive means to cause 
the support part to move up and down relative to the base as a result of pivotal 
movement of the links. The links may be pivotally mounted on one side of an upwardly extending 
mounting part provided on the base and on one side of a downwardly extending 
mounting part provided on the support part. The linkage may include a further link pivotally connected at one end to 
the base and at its other end to the support part about axes which are co-axial 
with the axes of pivot of the upper of said pair of upper and lower links. The further link may be disposed on the opposite side of said mounting 
parts to said pair of upper and lower links. Alternatively, particularly where the support part is relatively wide, two 
pairs of upper and lower links may be provided each pair being pivotally 
connected at their one ends to the base at vertically spaced positions and pivotally 
connected at their other ends to the support part at vertically spaced positions. The links of one pair may be pivotally mounted on one side of an upwardly 
extending mounting part provided on the base and one side of a downwardly 
extending mounting part on the support part whilst the links of the other pair may 
be pivotally mounted on the other side of a second upwardly extending mounting  
 
part provided on the base and on the other side of a second downwardly 
extending mounting part provided on the support part, said other sides facing in 
the opposite direction to said one side. The linkage may include a further link pivotally connected at one end of 
the base about the axis of pivotal connection of the upper of each pair of links 
to the base and at its opposite end to the support part about the axis of pivotal 
connection of the upper link of the pair of links to the support part with the 
further link being disposed between the upwardly extending mounting parts 
provided on the base and the downwardly

<CLAIMS>
A patient support comprising a base, a support part and a linkage to 
mount the support part on the base for movement up and down relative to the 

base, wherein the linkage comprises a pair of upper and lower links pivotally 
connected at their one ends to the base at vertically spaced positions and pivotally 

connected at their other ends to the support part at vertically spaced positions, 
and drive means to cause the support part to move up and down relative to the 

base as a result of pivotal movement of the links. 
A patient support according to Claim 1 wherein the links are pivotally 
mounted on one side of an upwardly extending mounting part provided on the 

base and on one side of a downwardly extending mounting part provided on the 
support part. 
A patient support according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the linkage 
includes a further link pivotally connected at one end to the base and at its other 

end to the support part about axes which are co-axial with the axes of pivot of the 
upper of said pair of upper and lower links. 
A patient support according to Claim 3 when dependent on Claim 2 
wherein the further link is disposed on the opposite side of said mounting parts 

to said pair of upper and lower links. 
A patient support according to Claim 1 wherein two pairs of upper and 
lower links are provided, each pair being pivotally connected at their one ends to 

the base at vertically spaced positions and pivotally connected at their other ends 
to the support part at vertically spaced positions. 
A patient support according to Claim 5 wherein the links of one pair are 
pivotally mounted on one side of an upwardly extending mounting part provided 

 
on the base and one side of a downwardly extending mounting part on the 

support part whilst the links of the other pair are pivotally mounted on the other 
side of a second upwardly extending mounting part provided on the base and on 

the other side of a second downwardly extending mounting part provided on the 
support part, said other sides facing in the opposite direction to said one side. 
A patient support according to Claim 6 wherein the linkage includes a 
further link pivotally connected at one end of the base about the axis of pivotal 

connection of the upper of each pair of links to the base and at its opposite end 
to the support part about the axis of pivotal connection of the upper link of the 

pair of links to the support part with the further link being disposed between the 
upwardly extending mounting parts provided on the base and the downwardly 

extending mounting part provided on the support part. 
A patient support according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the base comprises a generally centrally disposed longitudinally extending member 

and, at opposite ends thereof transversely extending members provided with a 
ground-engageable means, the patient supporting part being carried by the 

longitudinally extending member. 
A patient support comprising a base and support part mounted on the base 
where the base comprises a generally centrally disposed longitudinally extending 

member and at opposite ends thereof transversely extending members provided 
with ground-engageable means, the patient supporting part being carried by the 

longitudinally extending member. 
A patient support according to Claim 8 or Claim 9 wherein the transversely 
extending member of one end of the base extends perpendicular to the 

longitudinally extending member and/or the transversely extending member at 
one end of the base comprises a pair of inclined elements which diverge 

longitudinally and transversely from the longitudinally extending member.

extending member comprises either a) a single circular cross-section tube and, 

where a single upwardly extending mounting part is provided, the upwardly 
extending mounting part extends upwardly from the tube, or b) a pair of spaced 

parallel circular cross-section tubes interconnected by transversely extending 
members and, where two upwardly extending mounting parts are provided, one 

mounting part extends from each of the tubes.

base and comprising a chair, the chair being provided with at least one armrest 

connected to the chair for movement between a position in which the armrest 
extends generally longitudinally of the chair to a position in which the armrest 

extends transversely outwardly of the chair.
