<DESCRIPTION>
This relates to liquid laundry detergent compositions 
containing polyhydroxy fatty acid amide, silicone antifoam 
composition, and anionic, nonionic or amphoteric surfactant. The 
silicone antifoam composition includes primary antifoam agents, 
nonionic silicone surfactant, and polyethylene glycol or a 
copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol having a solubility 
in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %. Silicone antifoam compositions, and methods for producing 
them, have been described in, for example, U.S. Patents 4,639,489 
and 4,749,740, Aizawa et al, issued January 27, 1981 And June 7, 
1988, respectively; and U.S. Patents 4,978,471 ant 4,983,316. 
Starch, issued December 18, 1990 and January 8, 1991, 
respectively. Liquid laundry detergent compositions containing polyhydroxy 
fatty acid amide have been described in, for examle, WO-92-06154, 
published April 16, 1992 
as enzyme performance-enhancing or in WO-92-06153 published April 16, 1992 
as a dispersing agent. Anionic, nonionic and amphoteric 
surfactants are known ingredients of liquid laundry detergent 
compositions. It has been found that it is difficult to formulate available 
silicone antifoam compositions into liquid laundry detergent 
compositions containing polyhydroxy fatty acid amide. These 
formulations tend to separate out after a few days in product. 
Even if they can be formulated into a storage stable product, they 
must also be effective at controlling suds in liquid laundry 
detergents. High suds are not desirable in the washing machine. It has now been found that when polyethylene glycol (PEG), 
and/or copolymers of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol (PEG/PPG), 
having a solubility in water at room temperature of more than 
about 2 weight %, are substituted for the polypropylene glycol  
 
(PPG) heretofore present in a silicone antifoam composition, a 
stable, low sudsing liquid laundry detergent can be formulated. 
The liquid laundry detergent compositions, which contain 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide, remain homogeneous upon storage. 
The silicone antifoam compositions with PEG and/or PEG/PPG 
copolymer are surprisingly better at suds reduction in this 
formulation in the washing machine than are the silicone antifoam 
compositions with PPG. This relates to a homogeneous liquid laundry detergent 
composition, comprising: 
a. from 1 to 30 weight % of polyhydroxy fatty 
acid amide surfactant; c. from 0.001 to 1 weight % of silicone antifoam 
composition comprising: (1) a nonaqueous emulsion of a
