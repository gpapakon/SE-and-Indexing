<ABSTRACT>
A process for flocculating, in a liquid, suspended solids 
comprised of at least two minerals or primarily of minerals 

other than iron oxide and tin oxide. The solids are 
contacted with a hydroxamated polymer. The amount of 

hydroxamated polymer is sufficient to increase the settling 
rate of the solids and to decrease the turbidity of the 

solids.

<DESCRIPTION>
Ore is generally mined for the economically valuable minerals 
that can be extracted therefrom. In addition to the valuable 
minerals, ore also contains gangue minerals, which are waste 
products. The major classifications of minerals present in 
ore are native elements, sulfide and sulfo minerals, oxides 
and hydrated oxides, halogen minerals, nitrates, carbonates, 
borates, sulfate types, sulfite types and silicates. Iron, 
for example, may be present in the form of oxides, such as 
hematite (Fe₂O₃) and magnetite (FeFe₂O₄), or in the form of 
non-oxides, such as pyrrhotite (FeS), pyrite (FeS₂), siderite 
(FeCO₃), etc. In order to recover the valuable minerals of 
the ore, generally the ore is ground into fine particles and 
the valuable minerals are separated from the other minerals 
of the ore by a process such as froth flotation. In froth 
flotation, valuable minerals adhere to the froth bubbles and 
can be removed as part of the froth. The remainder of the 
minerals are not removed and so remain in an aqueous 
dispersion. This remainder is collectively called the 
tailings, which usually includes significant amounts of 
gangue minerals. Silicates such as quartz (SiO₂) and clay 
minerals, when not mined as the valuable mineral, are also 
often present in significant amounts in the tailings. The 
clays that remain in the aqueous dispersion formed during 
froth flotation are difficult to separate from the aqueous 
dispersion because they absorb water. Accordingly, there 
remains to be developed an efficient method of separating 
such suspended solids of ore from the liquid of the aqueous 
dispersion that results from the flotation process. In addition to froth flotation, it is known that iron oxide 
or tin oxide minerals can be separated as the valuable 
minerals from the other minerals present in the ore by 
selective flocculation using a hydroxamated polymer. In  
 
selective flocculation, macromolecules of the flocculent 
material are adsorbed by the particles to be flocculated. 
Hydroxamated polyacrylamide has been shown to selectively 
flocculate both iron oxide and tin oxide from other minerals. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,902,751, is expressly incorporated herein 
by reference to the extent necessary to understand the 
polymers of the present invention. Similarly, Shankar et al. 
in Bull. Mater. Sci.; Vol. 10; pages 423-433 (1988) discloses 
that by using a hydroxamated polyacrylamide, synthetic iron 
oxide can be selectively flocculated from kaolin, a type of 
silicate clay mineral typically present in

<CLAIMS>
A process for flocculating, in a liquid other than Bayer 
process streams, suspended solids primarily comprising 

minerals, other than iron oxide and/or tin oxide, or at 
least two minerals which process comprises contacting the 

solids with a hydroxamated polymer containing 1 to 90 
mole percent hydroxamic groups wherein the amount of 

hydroxamated polymer is sufficient to increase the 
settling rate of the solids or to decrease the turbidity 

of the liquid, as compared to the use of no polymer.
