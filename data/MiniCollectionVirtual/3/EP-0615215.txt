<ABSTRACT>
The counting station has a transport stage (2b), on which the banded bundles of securities (P) are moved uniformly at a specific distance past the rotating counting disc (1a, 1a') of a securities counter (1, 1') installed permanently on this transport stage. The transport stage (2b) is followed by a switch (9) with two further transport stages (2c, 2d), of which one receives bundles of securities with the correct number of securities and the other bundles of securities with an incorrect number of securities.

<CLAIMS>
A counting station for counting the notes of 
value, in particular banknotes, of banderoled packs of 

notes P in a processing apparatus for freshly printed 
notes of value, having at least one automatically 

operating counting device (1, 1') with rotating counting 
disk (1a, 1a') and with a transporting section for the 

packs of notes, wherein the counting device (1, 1') with 
its counting disk (la, la') is arranged stationarily on 

the transporting section (2b, 12) and this transporting 
section is equipped with a feed system (4, 5, 6; 16, 18) 

moving the packs of notes at certain intervals from one 
another uniformally past the counting disk (1a, 1a'). 
The counting station as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the feed system has drivers (4; 14) arranged at 

the same intervals from one another. 
The counting station as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the drivers (4) are flexibly yielding opposite to 

the transporting direction of the packs of notes (P). 
The counting station as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 3, wherein the feed system has front stops (5) for 

the packs of notes (P). 
The counting station as claimed in one of claims 
2 to 4, wherein the drivers (4) and, if provided, the 

front stops (5) are attached on a belt or chain conveyor 
(6) running underneath a fixed transporting support (3) 

and protrude through longitudinal grooves (3a) of the 
transporting support. 
The counting station as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 5, wherein the mentioned transporting section (2b) 

on which the counting device (1, 1') is fastened is 
inclined sloping downward in the transporting direction. 
The counting station as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the mentioned transporting section (12) is 

oriented substantially vertically and the feed mechanism 
has laterally open receiving compartments (18) and is set 

up for the purpose of moving the packs of notes (P), with 
their notes of value lying one on top of the other, 

upward past the counting device (1, 1'), the plane of the  
 

counting disk (1a, 1a') being oriented substantially 
horizontally. 
The counting station as claimed in claim 7, 
wherein the feed system has a closed belt or chain 

conveyor (16) which runs along an ovally shaped closed 
guide rail (13), oriented with its longitudinal axis 

substantially vertical, and on which the receiving 
compartments (18) are fastened such that they protrude 

radially, one of the vertical sections (13a) forming the 
transporting section (12) provided with at least one 

counting device (1). 
The counting station as claimed in claim 8, 
wherein the receiving compartments (18) have a rear wall 

(19), seen in the transporting direction, which is 
adapted to the overall bearing surface of a pack of notes 

and is provided in that corner region on which the note 
corner to be counted rests with an inwardly displaceable 

corner piece (19a), which can be pushed back by a push 
rod (28) on passing the counting disk (1a, 1a'). 
The counting station as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 9, wherein there are arranged on the mentioned 

transporting section (2b; 12) two counting devices (1, 
1'), which are arranged offset in the transporting 

direction and perform the counting at different corners 
of each pack of notes (P). 
The counting station as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 10, wherein there is arranged downstream of the 

mentioned transporting section (2b) a diverter (9) with 
two branching-off further transporting sections (2c, 2d), 

of which the one transporting section (2c) is set up for 
receiving packs of notes having a correct number of notes 

of value and the other transporting section (2d) is set 
up for receiving packs of notes having an incorrect 

number of notes of value.
