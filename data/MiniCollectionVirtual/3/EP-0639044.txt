<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify handling during the assembly and repair of printed circuit board assemblies, printed circuit boards and multichip modules having a large number of integrated circuits (IS) which are cooled by heat sinks (KK) placed thereon, it is proposed to insert a heat conducting foil (WF) between the casing surfaces (GO) of the integrated circuits (IS) and the heat sinks (KK), which heat conducting foil (WF) is common, need be installed only once and has a meandering perforation in such a manner that there are individual surfaces (EF) which are assigned to the contact surfaces between the integrated circuits (IS) and the respective heat sinks (KK), and, while being sprung with respect to one another to a limited extent, can be arranged at different levels corresponding to the levels of the casing surfaces (GO) of the integrated circuits (I).
