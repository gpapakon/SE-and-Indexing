<ABSTRACT>
The drive spring (3) is coiled inside a barrel through an angle alpha  = n2 pi  radians. The spring has a rectangular cross-section of constant width. At least a first portion of the spring extending from the wall (2) of the barrel towards the arbor (5) has an increasing thickness e chosen in such a way that the angle of coiling alpha  times the value cubed of the thickness e has a constant value, ie  alpha .e

 = constant. There is thus obtained, at least during the useful part, ie conventionally during the first 24 hours of running, a constant force delivered by the barrel and consequently a constant amplitude of the balance.

Mainspring (3) for timepiece coiled inside a 
barrel at an angle 
α
 of n2π radians, said spring having a 
rectangular section spiral form of constant width (h), the 

first end (4) of the spring being hooked to a core (5) 
integral with the barrel-arbor and the second end (6) 

being fixed to the wall (2) formed by the barrel, at least 
a first portion of the spring, extending from the barrel 

wall towards the core, having an increasing thickness, 
characterized in that the thickness e of the spring is 

selected so that the coiling angle 
α
 of said first portion 
of the spring times the cubed value of the thickness e of 

said spring at said angle α has a constant value, namely 

α·
e
3
 = constant. 
Mainspring according to claim 1, characterized in 
that t
he first portion of the spring extends onto the 
effective part of the spring whose length provides the 

operating power to the timepiece during at least the first 
twenty four hours of operation. 
Mainspring according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a second portion of the spring, situated between the 

end of said first portion and the core, comprises a 
decreasing thickness. 
Mainspring according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the spring extends substantially at an angle of n2π 

radians and that the effective part extends at an angle of 
n
π
 radians
