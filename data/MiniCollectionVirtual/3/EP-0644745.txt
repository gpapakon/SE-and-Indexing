<ABSTRACT>
An improved colostomy closure device of the type which includes a tubular elastic member (13), an annular ring (12) for radially tensioning the elastic member (13) to sealingly engage the periphery of the colostomy opening and a deformable cap member closing the inner end of the tubular elastic member and retaining the inner end within the open end of the intestine. The improvements include a venting system for releasing gas formed in the intestine, a deodorizing system for the vented gas and a multiple flange periphery (18) on the cap member to more completely seal against the inner mucosal wall of the open intestine end with reduced radial pressure exerted on the mucosa.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COLOSTOMY CLOSURE DEVICEThis invention relates to a device for closing a colostomy opening.More particularly, the invention concerns an improved colostomy closure device of the general type disclosed in my United States Patent 4,809,871, issued March 7, 1989.In a further and more particular respect the invention relates to an improved colostomy closure device which relieves the pressure of gas formed in the intestine.In another aspect the invention pertains to such an improved colostomy closure device which substantially deodorizes gases vented from the intestine through the device.In still another respect, the invention relates to a colostomy closure device which sealingly engages the interior of the open end of the intestine with improved reliability, but with reduced tendency to injure the mucosal intestinal lining.In my issued United States Letters Patent 4,809,871, issued March 7, 1989, I described a device for closing a surgically constructed opening, such as a colostomy or ileostomy opening, which could be easily and conveniently implaced and removed by simple finger manipulation by the 

patient, without the assistance of skilled attendants. Such a device has the potential to markedly reduce both the physical inconvenience and embarrassment (which may even lead to psychological impairment) , caused by the necessity of wearing an external colostomy bag or the like after a patient is subjected to such surgical procedures.Although the devices disclosed in my prior patent functioned effectively for shorter periods of time, there was, however, the need for further improvements to enhance the long-term utility of the devices. Most importantly, my prior device had to be removed periodically to vent gas which is normally formed in the intestine. While continuous venting was desirable, this had the potential for embarrassment of the patient because of the odor of the effluent gas. Finally, the integrity of the seal between the device and the interior of the intestine required that considerable pressure be exerted by the device against the mucosal inner lining of the intestine. After extended use by the patient, such pressure had the potential to cause irritation of the mucosa.Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide an improved colostomy closure device.Another object of the invention is to provide such an improved device which continuously vents gas produced in the intestine. 

 Yet another object of the invention is to provide a vented closure device which substantially

<CLAIMS>
1. In a device for closing a colostomy opening, formed by connection of an open end of the intestine with the periphery of an opening in the abdominal wall, said device including
a tubular elastic membrane, dimensioned to extend from the inner end thereof, through said opening to the outer end thereof outside the abdomen,
deformable cap means for closing the inner end of said tubular membrane, and
means for radially tensioning said membrane to sealingly engage with the periphery of said opening,
said deformable cap means being shaped and dimensioned to be temporarily deformed to pass through said opening, into the open end of the intestine and to autogenously reassume an undeformed shape, which retains said cap within the intestine,
the improvement comprising:
means defining a vent in said cap means, which permits passage of gas from the interior of the intestine, but which retains liquids and solids therewithin. 


 2. The improved colostomy closure device of Claim 1, which further includes means for deodorizing gases passing through said vent. 


3. The improved colostomy closure device of Claim 1, in which the cap means further includes
at least two spaced, radially extending annular sealing flanges which are shaped and dimensioned to flexibly bear outwardly against and sealingly engage the inner surface of the intestine when said cap is undeformed.
