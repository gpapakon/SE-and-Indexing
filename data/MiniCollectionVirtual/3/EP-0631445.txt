<ABSTRACT>
In a projector device for displaying a color image 
on an image displaying surface by projecting the 

pictures which are composed of one of a red component, 
a green component, and a blue component of image data 

on the image displaying surface; a red light, a green 
light, and a blue light are sequentially emitted on a 

reflecting surface with a circulative switching scheme, 
the reflecting surface is composed of a plurality of 

reflector elements of the reflector means, the 
reflector elements are arranged in corresponding with 

pixels of the image data, wherein the reflective 
directions of each reflector elements are sequentially 

switched based on the image data in synchronization 
with the switching of the colors. Thereby, a projector 

device can be formed with a simple construction, and 
the whole device can be miniaturized. Furthermore the 

utilization ratio of the light source can be improved, 
therefore, a small-size light-weight projector device 

which is able to display images brighter, can be 
realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a projector device, and 
more particularly, is applicable to such devices that 
project color images. Heretofore, there is such projector device that 
displays a red component, a green component, and a blue 
component of the image data on three CRTs (cathode ray 
tube) separately. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, in a projection 
type three-tube projector device 1, three CRTs 2A, 2B, 
and 2C are linearly arranged side by side on the front 
of the device. On the side where image projection 
surfaces of CRTs 2A to 2C reside, a red filter, a green 
filter, and a blue filter are disposed respectively 
along with their projection lenses. In projecting, 
CRTs 2A to 2C separately project a red component, a 
green component, or a blue component of the image data 
directly on the screen 3. The projected light of a red 
component, the projected light of a green component,  
 
and the projected light of a blue component, which are 
separately projected by CRTs 2A to 2C, are synthesized 
to form a single image on the screen 3, so that a 
moving color image is displayed as a whole. On the other hand, in a reflection type three-tube 
projector device 10, as shown in Fig. 2, the device 10 
has a box type configuration as a whole, and a 
projector 11 which has the same composition as the 
projection type three-tube projector device 1 is 
arranged within. Furthermore, a semitransparent screen 12 like a 
frosted glass is arranged in the front of the 
reflection type three-tube projector device 10, while a 
reflector plate 13 is arranged inside the device 10. 
Thus, the projected lights of red, green, and blue, 
which are projected by the projector 11, are reflected 
in a folded manner by the reflector board 13, and then 
focused on the back-side surface of the screen 12. 
Therefore, moving color images can be seen on the front 
surface of the screen 12. However, as to projector devices 1 and 10 having 
the above mentioned construction, owing to the fact 
that the CRTs 2A to 2C are utilized as the light source 
and that the images projected by those CRTs 2A to 2C  
 
are enlarged on the screen 3, 12, it is difficult to 
display images brightly, additionally, there is a 
problem that the whole device becomes large. To solve these problems, a plan of a projector 
device has been proposed, in which three liquid-crystal 
panel boards are used in place of CRTs, and a red 
component, a green component, and a blue component are 
separately displayed on each of the liquid-crystal 
panel boards, and at

an image displaying surface, by projecting divisional 

images of each frame, each image of which is composed 
of the circulatively selected red component, green 

component, or blue component of image data, on said
