<ABSTRACT>
An air valve, for controlling feedback air in spray guns, comprising a valve body (10) and valve member (9), a spindle (6) slidably sealed through valve body (10) and valve member (9), spindle (6) having a shoulder (7) closing a first seating (8) in valve member (9), the rear of spindle (6) slidable in a shuttle (15) which also slides in a fixed valve spool (12) having a second seating (12a) closed by the rear of shuttle (15). Two ports (22, 23) are provided one either side of second seating (12a) between spool (12) and shuttle (15) for feedback air past the valve and two ports (24, 25) provided either side of first seating (18) between valve member (9) and spindle shoulder (7) for main air through the valve, so that operation of spindle (6) opens the first valve prior to the second valve and closes the second valve prior to the first valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air valve more particularly for controlling the 
feedback air in HVLP spray guns. Such air valves are generally known and one such is described and claimed in 
WO-A-91/03320. 
This document discloses an air valve for controlling air flow in spray 
guns and comprising a valve body and a fixed valve member, a spindle slidable and 
sealingly passing through the valve body and valve member, the spindle having a shoulder 
engaging and closing a first seating in the valve member, the rear of the spindle slidable in 
a second valve member arranged in a valve spool, the valve spool having a second seating 
closed by the rear of the second valve member. An aim of the present invention is to shut off the feedback line when the 
spraygun is in the Off position. According to the present invention there is provided an air valve for controlling 
the feedback air in spray guns comprising a valve body and valve member, a spindle 
slidable and sealingly passing through the valve body and valve member, the spindle 
having a shoulder engaging and closing a first seating in the valve member the rear of the 
spindle slidable in a shuttle which is itself slideable in a fixed valve spool, the spool having 
a second seating closed by the rear of the shuttle wherein two ports are provided one at 
either side of the second seating between the spool and shuttle for the passage of feedback 
air past the valve and two further ports are provided one at either side of the first seating 
between the valve member and spindle shoulder for the passage of main air through the 
valve so  
 
that operation of the spindle opens the first seating 
prior to the second seating and closes the second seating 
prior to the first seating. Preferably, the spindle is returned to its closed 
position by a spring engaging the valve spindle. 
An embodiment of an air valve according to the 
invention will now be described by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional elevation of a spray 
gun fitted with an air valve; and Figs. 2 to 5 are diagrammatic cross-sections of the 
air valve shown in Fig. 1 in different operational 
positions. The spray gun shown in Fig. 1 comprises a main 
body 1, a handle 2 and an air cap 4. The paint is fed 
from a reservoir under the control of a regulator (not 
shown). The air valve illustrated controls the feedback air 
sensed at the gun air cap 4 and is operated by the gun's 
trigger 5. Fig. 2 illustrates the air valve in the off 
p

<CLAIMS>
An air valve for controlling the feedback air in 
spray guns comprising a valve body (10) and a fixed 

valve member (9), a spindle (6) slidable and sealingly 
passing through the valve body (10) and valve member 

(9), the spindle (6) having a shoulder (7) engaging and 
closing a first seating (8) in the valve member (9), 

characterised in that 
the rear of the spindle (6) is slidable in a shuttle (15) 

which is itself slidable in a fixed valve spool (12), 
the spool having a second seating (12a) closed by the 

rear of the shuttle (15), two ports 
(22, 23) being provided one at either side of the second 

seating (12a) between the spool (12) and shuttle (15) for 
the passage of feedback air past the valve and two 

further ports (24, 25) being provided at either side of 
the first seating (8) between the valve member (9) and 

spindle shoulder (7) for the passage of main air through 
the valve so that operation of the spindle (6) opens the 

first seating prior to the second seating and closes the 
second seating prior to the first seating. 
An air valve as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the spindle (6) is returned to its closed 

position by a spring (17) which bears on a cup (16) 
engaging the valve spindle. 
An air valve as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the shuttle (15) is sealed by an O-ring 

seal between the spindle (6) and shuttle (15) 
against the passage of air past the seal. 
An air valve as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the shuttle (15) is sealed by an O-ring 

seal between the shuttle (15) and valve spool (12) 
against the passage of air past the seal (19). 
An air valve as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the valve spool (12) is sealed in 

the body (1) of a spray gun by an O-ring seal (20) 
against the passage of air past the seal (20).  

 
An air valve as claimed in any of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that one end of the spring (17) is held 

by the cup (16) and the other end of the spring engages 
the body (1) of a spray gun, the spring cup (16) engaging 

the shuttle to close the seating between the spool and 
shuttle (15). 
An air valve as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein a resilient seal (11) is located in a recess in 

the valve body (10) to surround and seal the passage of 
air past the spindle (16).
