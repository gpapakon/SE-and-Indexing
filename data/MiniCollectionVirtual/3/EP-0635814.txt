<ABSTRACT>
This is an installation intended to inform the users of an omnibus network of the waiting times for the buses at the stops of the network, installations comprising a central station capable of transmitting radio frequency signals relating to the actual instantaneous positions of the buses, and portable receiver boxes (1) capable of displaying the waiting times on screens (3). In each box an identification symbol of this box and (at 11) a subscription end-date are recorded, and only when the box is intended for use before the said date can the desired displays be obtained on the screen. There is provision for remotely revalidating the box for new subscription periods after each subscription lapses.

<CLAIMS>
An installation for informing the users of a bus 
network on bus waiting times at stops of the network, the 

installation comprising firstly means themselves 
including a central station for collecting data 

identifying the instantaneous positions of various buses 
travelling along the various lines of the network, means 

for generating electrical signals on the basis of said 
data for the purpose of providing information about said 

positions, and means for transmitting said signals over 
an electromagnetic path; and also a plurality of portable 

receiver appliances (1) each including means for 
receiving the above signals and for selecting from said 

signals those relating to the buses expected at a given 
stop of a given line of the network, and means for making 

use of the signals selected in this way for the purpose 
of displaying the waiting times for said buses at said 

stop, the installation being characterized in that each 
portable receiver appliance further comprises an 

appliance identification circuit (8) itself including a 
memory that lends itself to recording a coded 

identification symbol, means enabling said recorded 
symbol to be compared with symbols of the same type 

included in the electromagnetic check signals received by 
the appliance and for making execution of the checking 

performed by said signals contingent on correct results 
of such comparisons; and a circuit (10) for checking the 

validity of the appliance, itself comprising a memory 
(11) lending itself to recording successive code symbols 

representing expiry dates F and means for comparing the 
real dates R on which the above-mentioned check signals 

are transmitted with each date F recorded during a given 
period, and for making access of signals useful to the 

operating circuits (7) of the appliance contingent on 
correct results of said comparisons, and in that the 

central station includes means for generating and 
transmitting encoded check signals suitable, firstly, for  

 
being identified by the appliances, and secondly, for 

comparing the real dates R with the expiry dates F 
recorded in the appliances. 
An installation according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the check signals themselves include encoded 

portions representing the real dates R on which said 
signals are transmitted. 
An installation according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the real dates R on which the appliances are 

operable are determined by clocks carried by the 
appliances. 
An installation according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the memory (11) in each appliance 

(1) for recording the expiry dates F is organized in such 

a manner as to lend itself to replacing each expiry date 
with another date merely on reception of appropriate 

electrical signals, the central station being organized 
in such a manner as to generate and transmit such 

subscription renewal signals. 
A portable receiver appliance included in an 
installation according to any one of claims 1-4, 

characterized in that it includes the above-specified 
appliance identification and appliance validity checking 

circuits. 
A portable appliance according to claim 5, 
characterized in that it includes a display screen (3) 

together with means (13) for displaying on said screen a 
message in the clear indicating that a subscription has 

expired and possibly also the consequences to be drawn 
therefrom as soon as the expiry date F recorded in the 

appliance has been exceeded.
