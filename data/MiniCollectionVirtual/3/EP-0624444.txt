<ABSTRACT>
Polyurethane foam scrap can be reduced to the desired particle size, in a way which produces little dust and saves energy for recycling as an additive in polyurethane production in a fine reduction apparatus (11) arranged downstream of a coarse reduction apparatus (12). This is performed by the fine reduction taking place preferably by repeated pressing through a die (19) or through a plurality of dies (19, 21) of a mixture of the coarse-reduced material and one of the reaction components.

Process for reprocessing polyurethane foam wastes, in 
particular flexible foam wastes, for recycling as an 

additive in the production of polyurethane from polyol 
and isocyanate, wherein the wastes are first 

comminuted coarsely, the particles obtained are mixed 
with one of the reaction components, and the latter 

mixture undergoes fine comminution, characterised in 
that a coarse comminution takes place down to a 

maximum particle size of 10 mm, that the particles 
thus obtained are dosed into the reaction component 

and are homogenised therewith, and that the latter 
mixture is forced under pressure through a nozzle (19, 

21; 41; 64, 65, 66) for fine comminution. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the particles obtained as a result of the coarse 

comminution are dosed directly into the stream of one 
of the reaction components supplied to a mixing head 

(54), and are homogenised therein, and the stream thus 
charged is forced through nozzles (64, 65, 66) before 

reaching the mixing head (54). 
Apparatus for reprocessing polyurethane foam wastes, 
in particular flexible foam wastes, for recycling as 

an additive in the production of polyurethane from 
polyol and isocyanate, comprising a coarse comminution 

apparatus (12; 59) downstream whereof there is 
arranged a fine comminution apparatus (11; 58), 

wherein there is arranged between the coarse 
comminution apparatus (12; 59) and the fine 

comminution apparatus (11; 58) a homogenising 
apparatus (9, 10; 62) upstream whereof or whereinto 

there opens a feed line (6; 56) for a reaction 
component, characterised in that the fine comminution 

apparatus (11; 58) comprises at least one nozzle (19,  
 

21; 41; 64, 65, 66), and a pressure pump (18; 63) is 
arranged upstream of the said nozzle (19, 21; 41; 64, 

65, 66). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the flow area of the nozzle (19, 21; 41; 64, 65, 66) 

is selected so as to be larger than the particles to 
be forced through. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterised in that there is arranged one behind the 

other a plurality of nozzles (19, 21; 41; 64, 65, 66) 
having a decreasing flow area. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that an impact chamber (20) is 

arranged downstream of the nozzle (19). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that it is arranged directly in a 

feed line (56, 71) of one of the reaction components, 
which leads to a mixing head (54) of a foaming 

apparatus, wherein the homogenising apparatus (62) 
comprises a static mixer or a paddle mixer.
