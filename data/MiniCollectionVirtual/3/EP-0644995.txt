<ABSTRACT>
In a device designed as a rotatively mounted platform (a) for recovering solar electricity, the focussing roof layer (3) further deflects the incident radiation, so that the luminous beam (122, 123, 126) formed by the concentrating optics hits the radiation converter (112) arranged underneath approximately vertically.
