<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with new ethers of 
γ-cyclodextrin, their preparation and their use as complexants for 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals. γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) is a cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of 
8 glucose units which are joined together by α(1-4) linkages. 
 
γ-CD is prepared by the enzymatic cleavage and religation of starch and 
a subsequent separation from the thus obtained cyclodextrin mixture 
containing i.a. α-cyclodextrin (containing 6 glucose units), 
β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) (7 glucose units) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD). Cyclodextrins are known in the art to possess the ability to form 
inclusion complexes and to have concomitant solubilizing properties. An 
exhaustive review which describes such complexes and their properties can 
be found in W. Sänger, Angewandte Chemie, 92, 343-361 (1981).  
 Derivatives of cyclodextrins are also known to possess the above-mentioned 
properties. Said derivatives have been reviewed in an article 
by A.P. Croft and R.A. Bartsch in Tetrahedron, 39, 1417-1474 (1983). 
More particularly, the German Offenlegungsschrift DE 3118218 discloses 
the 2,6-dimethyl derivatives of β-CD, while in U.S. Patent No. 3,459,731 
there are described hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl and hydroxypropyl/hydroxyethyl 
ethers of β-CD. Furthermore, in U.S. Patent Appl. Ser. No. 6-603 
839 there is described the use of specific derivatives of cyclodextrines 
to improve the systemic administration of sex hormones. Most of the 
cyclodextrin derivatives presently known in the art are derived from 
β-CD, while the derivatives of α-CD and particularly of γ-CD remain 
relatively unknown. The use of derivatives of β-CD has the following advantages. β-CD is 
only poorly water soluble and therefore it is disadvantageous to use it 
as a complexant and solubilizer. Derivatives of β-CD on the other hand, 
due to their increased solubility, are more suitable complexants and 
solubilizers. In contrast herewith, α-CD and γ-CD having an excellent 
water solubility do not need such substitutions. Hence, it is obvious to 
use unsubstituted γ-CD (and α-CD) as complexant and solubilizer. 
Particularly for γ-CD, a number of such complexes with various useful 
compounds can be found in e.g. Int. J. Pharm. 10, 1-15 (1982) with 
steroid hormones, in Acta Pharm. Suec. 20, 11-20 (1983) with 
flurtripofen, in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 31, 286-291 (1983) with spirolacton 
and in Acta Pharm. Suec. 20, 287-294 (1983) with proscillaridin. γ-CD does not form such inclusion complexes with any given 
compound.
