<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport carriage (transport car, truck, trolley), movable on a carriageway, with a rectangular base frame comprising elongate frame elements. In order to make it possible to couple a plurality of such transport carriages to one another in a simple manner and with a simple action so that they can be moved as one, it is proposed that in at least one first frame element (1) there be provided two holes (2,3), which run vertically with respect to the plane of travel and of which at least one is continuous, and in each further frame element (4), which lies opposite the first frame element (1), there be provided at least one single hole (5), there being arranged in a continuous hole (2) of the first frame element (1) a round pin (6) in a manner which allows it to be displaced and pivoted in its longitudinal direction, which pin is connected at its upper end, via a connecting piece (7), to a shorter, downwardly protruding round pin (8), and, in this manner, a coupling (18) is formed. The single hole (5) is arranged in such a manner that if a first frame element (1) of a transport carriage lies adjacent to the further frame element (4) of a further transport carriage, the shorter round pin (8) can then be inserted into the hole (5) of this further frame element (4), and the second hole (3) of the first frame element (1) is spaced apart from its other hole (2) in such a manner that in the rest position the shorter round pin (8) can be inserted there after being pivoted around the round pin (6).

Truck capable of travelling on a road with a right-angled 
base frame consisting of elongate frame elements 

characterized in that two orifices (2, 3) extending 
vertically to the plane of travel of which at least one (2) 

is continuous is provided in at least one first frame 
element (1, 10) and at least one individual orifice (5) is 

provided in each further frame element (4, 11) opposite the 
first frame element (1, 10), wherein a round bolt (6) is 

arranged so as to be displaceable in its longitudinal 
direction and pivotal round its longitudinal direction in 

a continuous orifice (2) in the first frame element 
(1, 10), the round bolt (6) being connected at its upper 

end via a connecting piece (7) to a shorter, downwardly 
projecting round bolt (8) and thus forming a coupling (18), 

wherein the individual orifice (5) is arranged in such a 
way that, when a first frame element (1, 10) of a truck (9) 

is located adjacently to the further frame element (4, 10) 
of a further truck, the shorter round bolt (8) can be 

inserted into the individual orifice (5) of this further 
frame element (4, 11) and wherein the second orifice (3) of 

the first frame element (1, 10) is spaced from its other 
orifice (2) in such a way that, in the rest position, the 

shorter round bolt (8) after pivoting round the 
longitudinal direction of the round bolt (6) can be 

inserted there. 
Truck according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
elongate frame elements (1, 4, 10, 11) are formed from 

rectangular tube in whose walls (12 - 15) located parallel 
to the plane of travel the orifices (2, 3, 5) are 

introduced.  
 
Truck according to Claim 2, characterized in that at least 
the orifices (2, 5), serving to produce the connection by 

means of the coupling (18), are formed by pieces of tube 
(16, 17) inserted into corresponding apertures in the frame 

elements (1, 4, 10, 11). 
Truck according to Claim 3, characterized in that pieces of 
tube (16, 17) are welded in. 
Truck according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
coupling (18) is bent into the form of a U from round 

material with arms which are accordingly of different 
lengths to form the round bolt (6) and the shorter round 

bolt (8) and are connected to one another via the 
connecting piece (7). 
Truck according to Claim 5, characterized in that the round 
bolt (6) projects on the lower side of the associated 

orifice (2) and, at the projecting end, has a securing 
element (19) to prevent it from being pulled out. 
Truck according to Claim 6, characterized in that a 
resilient element is arranged between securing element (19) 

and piece of tube (16). 
Truck according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
resilient element is designed as a helical compression 

spring (20) arranged coaxially to the round bolt (6). 
Truck according to one of Claims 6 to 8, characterized in 
that the securing element (19) is designed as a clamping 

sleeve driven transversely through a corresponding orifice. 
Truck according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
connecting piece (7) is designed in the form of an arc to 

form a handle.  
 
Truck according to Claim 10, characterized in that a 
support plate (25) is provided between round bolt (6) and 

the beginning of the arc-shaped connecting piece coaxially 
to the round bolt (6).
