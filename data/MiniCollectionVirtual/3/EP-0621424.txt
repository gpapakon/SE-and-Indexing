<ABSTRACT>
A rotary magnetic valve including a 
cylindrical housing (12) having flow passages (14,16) in both ends 

and a magnetically-responsive valve closure assembly (18) 
rotatively mounted therein. The valve closure 

assembly (18) includes an armature (34) mounted to rotate about 
the longitudinal axis of the housing (12) and a shoe (36,38) 

slideably disposed on each end of the armature. Each 
shoe is biased away from the armature (34) and into contact 

with the inner end surfaces of the housing (12). A 
controller assembly (46) is provided to rotate the valve 

closure assembly (18) between a first position where flow 
through the valve is prevented and a second position 

where flow is permitted. The controller includes at 
least one permanent magnet (48,50) for biasing the valve 

closure assembly into one of the positions and an 
electromagnet (52) for rotating the valve closure assembly (18) 

into the other position. A three-way valve is also 
possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
magnetically operated valves and more particularly
concerns a valve having a rotatable closure element
which is rotated between open and closed positions by
an electromagnet. The rotary magnetic valve is
applicable to many uses and is particularly useful in
dual evaporator refrigeration systems.Energy efficiency is an extremely important
factor in the design of refrigeration systems. This
is particularly so for household refrigerators having
multiple temperature requirements, e.g., fresh food
and freezer compartments. The refrigeration cycle
traditionally used in household refrigerators utilizes
a single evaporator operated at the low freezer
temperature. Refrigerator air is blown across the
evaporator and the air flow is split so that a large
part of the flow goes to the freezer compartment and
the remainder goes to the fresh food compartment.
This cycle thus produces a refrigeration effect which
is appropriate for the freezer compartment but lower
than need be for the fresh food compartment. As such,
the traditional cycle is not as energy efficient as a 
cycle having two evaporators operating at different
temperatures.Thus, one cost effective approach to better
energy efficiency has been the development of more
efficient refrigeration cycles. For example, the
application EP-A-0485146
discloses an efficient dual evaporator,
single compressor refrigeration cycle. U.S. Patent
No. 4,242,116 to Matthias Aschberger et al discloses
another dual evaporator, single compressor cycle.
Both of these cycles require a valving arrangement for
selectively controlling the flow of refrigerant
through the system.Conventional solenoid valves will satisfy
the flow control requirements but tend to operate at
excessive noise and wear levels. For instance, U.S.
Patent No. 4,242,116 discloses a three-way magnetic
valve which comprises a tubular housing having an
axial bore hole with an inlet to the bore hole and an
outlet at each end of the housing. A plunger-armature
assembly is disposed in the bore hole and is moved
longitudinally against a spring force by an
electromagnet. Sealing cones on the ends of the
plunger engage valve seats at the respective outlets
for selectively closing the outlets. The action of
the sealing cones striking the respective valve seats
each time the plunger position is switched produces a
relatively loud clicking noise and significant part
wear. For these refrigeration cycles, it is estimated
that a valve will need a 20 million cycle life.Generally, it is

A valve (10) comprising:

a housing (12) having a hollow interior and first and second passages (14,16)
in fluid communication with said hollow interior;
a valve closure device (18) rotatively mounted in said hollow interior; and
a controller (46) for selectively rotating said valve closure device between a
first position and a second position, characterised in that
said valve closure device (18) comprises a flat rectangular member having first

and second ends and mounted for rotation about a longitudinal axis intersecting said
first and second ends, and
said first and second ends block said first and second passages when said valve
closure device is in said first position, and do not block said first and second passages

when said valve closure device is in said second position.
The valve of claim 1 wherein said controller comprises at least one permanent
magnet (48,50) situated to attract said valve closure device to one of said first and

second positions and an electromagnet (52) having a stronger magnetic field than said
permanent magnet situated to attract said valve closure device to the other one of said

first and second positions.
The valve of claim 1 wherein said valve closure device includes a first shoe 
(36) associated with one of said ends of said flat rectangular member, and a second

shoe (38) associated with the other of said ends.
The valve of claim 3 wherein each of said first and second shoes is biased away
from said flat rectangular member.
The valve of claim 3 wherein said flat rectangular flat rectangular member is
an armature attracted to a magnetic field.
The valve of claim 5 wherein said flat rectangular member comprises a ferrous
material.
The valve of claim 5 wherein said controller comprises a first magnet (48)
situated to attract said valve closure device to one of said first and second positions

and a second magnet (52) situated to attract said valve closure device to the other one
of said first and second positions.
The valve of claim 7 wherein the first magnet is a permanent magnet and said
second magnet is an electromagnet having a stronger magnetic field than said

permanent magnet.
The valve of claim 8 wherein said electromagnet comprises a C-shaped core 
(54) straddled over said housing and a coil (58) wound around said core.
The valve of claim 9 wherein said coil is connected to a DC power source (60).
The valve of claim 1 wherein said housing includes a third passage (133) in
fluid communication with said hollow interior, said valve closure device permitting

fluid flow between said first and third passages when in said first position and
preventing fluid flow between said first and third passages when in said second

position.
