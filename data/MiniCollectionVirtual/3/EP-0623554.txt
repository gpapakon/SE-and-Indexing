<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous stream containing a water-soluble, inorganic sulfide compound 
is treated to selectively produce the corresponding sulfate by contacting the aqueous 

stream and oxygen at a pH of less than 12 and at an oxygen to sulfur molar ratio greater 
than 5:1 with an oxidizing catalyst at oxidation conditions effective to selectively convert 

at least 95% of the inorganic sulfide compound to the corresponding sulfate to thereby 

produce a substantially sulfide-free treated aqueous product stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains is the treatment of aqueous
streams containing water-soluble inorganic sulfide compounds. More specifically, the
invention is directed toward a method for treating an aqueous stream containing a
water-soluble, inorganic sulfide compound to selectively convert at least 95% of the
sulfide to the corresponding sulfate.US-A-3,672,836 discloses a process wherein an aqueous stream containing a
water-soluble, inorganic sulfide compound is treated by contacting the aqueous stream
and oxygen, in an amount selected to react less than 0.5 mol of oxygen per mol of
sulfide compound with a first oxidizing catalyst at oxidizing conditions, including a
relatively low pressure and temperature, selected to form an effluent stream containing
a water-soluble polysulfide; and thereafter by contacting the polysulfide-containing
effluent stream and oxygen in an amount less than the amount utilized in the first step,
with a second oxidizing catalyst at oxidizing conditions, including a temperature greater
than, or equal to, the melting point of sulfur and a pressure sufficient to maintain at
least a portion of the effluent stream in the liquid phase selected to produce liquid
sulfur and a substantially sulfide-free treated water stream. Sulfur is the primary
product of the invention of the '836 patent and the patent is silent with respect to
methods to achieve high conversion and high selectivity to the corresponding sulfate. US-A-3,029,202 discloses a method of treating waste water containing a
sulfur impurity which comprises reacting the sulfur impurity with ascending air in
contact with a phthalocyanine catalyst during descent of the water in a cooling tower.
Although a portion of the sulfur impurities are converted to sulfates, the sulfur
impurities are primarily converted to the corresponding thiosulfates.In various industrial applications, water containing sulfur impurities is
collected prior to disposal. For example, in a petroleum refinery, large quantities of
water are used in refining operations such as purifying hydrocarbon fractions, steam
distillation, heat transfer, and dilution of corrosive materials. The more abundant
impurities are hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans and thiophenols. With the increase in the
size of petroleum refineries and in the number of processing steps in refinery
operations, the amount of impurities in the water is increased to an extent that may be
harmful to marine life when the waste water is disposed of in the neighboring streams.The
