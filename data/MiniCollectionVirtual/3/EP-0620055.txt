<ABSTRACT>
Dynamic air sparging soil decontamination system employing 
self-propelled 

crane (33) with Kelly bar (12) driven ten foot diameter soil agitating 
drill (14), compressed air delivery through the Kelly bar (12) to the 

agitated soil, 
shroud (15) for collecting volatile contaminant at the site surface 

released 
from the agitated soil by the compressed air, conducting the volatile 

contaminant through a HEPA carbon filter system (24) and air compressor 
(28) mounted 

as a counterweight on a platform extension (32) of the crane (33) for 
removing the 

contaminants and recirculating compressed air to the agitated soil.

<DESCRIPTION>
Crane-mounted drill and method for in-situ treatment of 
contaminated soil is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,135,058, which includes 
the basic drilling and fluid supply means of the present invention, but 
without the specific processing application and decontaminating apparatus 
which has been found to be highly effective for a high percentage of 
contaminated sites. U.S. Patent 4,834,194 entitled Method and Apparatus for Detection 
of Volatile Soil Contaminants In-Situ relates to methods and apparatus for 
agitating and heating a subsurface volume of soil to liberate volatile 
compositions therefrom that are transmitted from a special flow passage 
created through the soil to the soil surface where they are analyzed to 
determine the presence or absence of selected contaminants. Treatment for 
the released volatile compositions depends upon the data obtained 
concerning soil contamination and, as generally stated, may consist of any 
combination of steps including the injection of additional hot air or 
steam for stripping of volatile contaminants, injection of treatment 
chemicals or biological treatment media etc.  The method and apparatus of the present invention is directed 
specifically to the method of in-situ drilling, agitating, mixing and 
injecting high pressure air into a contaminated soil site to release 
volatiles into a shroud at the top of the drilling site, thereupon 
conducting the volatile contaminants through an activated carbon bed and 
HEPA filter system capable of removing up to 99.8% of the contaminants 
from which discharged air may be recirculated to a compressor intake for 
recycling in the drilled earth contaminated site, or otherwise released. Conventional counterweights of a mobile drill crane are removed 
and replaced with air compressor and filter apparatus of comparable weight 
to provide an integral mobile system. The present invention will be more clearly understood 
from the following description, given by way of example 
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Fig. 1 is side elevation of a prior art crane such as disclosed 
in said '058 Patent; Fig. 2 is an end elevation of the prior art crane illustrated in 
Fig. 1 including typical auxilliary apparatus; Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a prior art compressor having a 
capacity comparable to that employed in the present system; Fig. 4 is a fragmentary schematic side elevation of the mobile 
crane rig of the present invention at an in-situ treatment site; and Fig. 5 is a fragmentary.schematic plan
