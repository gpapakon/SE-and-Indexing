<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a compression ignition 
internal combustion engine wherein (i) the engine 

includes a reciprocating piston operable within a 
cylinder for placing a combustible fuel/air charge under 

compression within a combustion chamber sufficient to 
cause self-ignition when operating at a predetermined 

elevated engine temperature; and (ii) a glow plug having 
a heating element projecting within the combustion 

chamber to provide sufficient heat to the compressed 
fuel/air charge to ignite it when starting or operating 

the engine below said predetermined elevated engine 
temperature. The method comprises (a) providing power 

to said glow plug and initially establishing the temperature 
of the heating element at a temperature exceeding 

1600°F; (b) starting the engine; (c) concurrently 
continuing to operate the engine and maintaining the 

heating element temperature at least at 1600°F until the 
engine temperature is sufficient to cause self ignition 

of the compressed fuel/air charge without the additional 
heat energy provided by the heating element; and (d) 

maintaining the heating element at a temperature exceeding 
1600°F throughout at least a portion of the entire 

remaining period of operation of the engine (and preferably 
between 1600-2000°F during the entire period of 

operation). 
The method also includes the option of reducing 
the power supplied to glow plug in fixed decrements 

and continuing power to the glow plug at the decremented 
voltage level for as long as the current plug voltage is 

available at the decremented voltage level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of operating 
compression ignition type internal combustion engines, 
notably two-cycle and four-cycle diesel engines, and in 
the structure of a glow plug having design features 
useful to the operation of the engine. Compression ignition type internal combustion 
engines such as the two-cycle and more recently four-cycle 
diesel engines are well known. U.S. Patent No. 
4,539,948, owned by the assignee of the present invention, 
is a typical example of a two-cycle engine, and 
the teachings thereof are incorporated herein by reference. 
Notably, the operation requires use of a glow 
plug positioned within the combustion chamber near the 
fuel injector to provide initial ignition of the compressed 
air/fuel mixture for whatever period of time may 
be required to bring the engine up to operating temperature. A glow plug suitable for such use includes a 
conventional metal sheath-type glow plug, 
capable of bringing 
the compressed fuel/air mixture to ignitable temperature 
within a relatively short period of time at ambient 
temperatures ranging anywhere from -32°C (-25°F) and upward.  
 
Pre-glow time may be as short as 4 -6 seconds at relatively 
high ambient temperatures extending to as much as 
24-30 seconds at the lower ambient temperatures, i.e., - 32°C 
(-25°F.). As an assist, it has been known to provide an 
air-inlet heater, particularly for high power density 
engines, for starting unaided at temperatures as low as -32°C 
(-25°F) and below -32°C (-25°F) with the glow plug as an additional 
starting device. More recently, a great deal of commercial 
interest and production effort has been shown and 
expended in the development of ceramic/metal glow plugs 
and all-ceramic glow plugs. The former includes a metal 
heating filament, generally tungsten, molded within a 
ceramic heater element tip, as shown, for example, in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4, 912, 305 and 5, 086, 210. The latter comprises 
the use of electrically conductive ceramic particles 
molded in an all ceramic heating element such as disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,528,121. The development of 
the ceramic glow plugs, particularly the all-ceramic 
glow plug, provides a glow plug capable of developing 
much higher tip temperatures and doing so under a much 
shorter pre-glow heating period of time. Given the high temperatures which can be 
developed in the all-ceramic glow plug, and considering 
also the ability of ceramics to maintain strength at 
elevated temperatures, there is created the opportunity 
to use
