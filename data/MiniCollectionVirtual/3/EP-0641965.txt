<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hollow tubular element which is exposed to high humidity levels and high temperatures, especially a steam-resistant hose or the like, a compensator and an air spring, the hollow element comprising an inner layer and outer layer of elastomeric material and an embedded single-ply or multi-ply reinforcement and also, if appropriate, one or more additional intermediate layers of elastomeric material, the reinforcement being a hydrolysis-resistant aramid.

<CLAIMS>
A hollow body in the form of a hose, consisting of

respective inner and outer layers of elastomeric material,
an embedded single-layer or multilayer strength-carrier of
aramide, as well if necessary as
of one or more additional interlayers of elastomeric material;

characterized in that the aramide

is hydrolysis-resistant,
is made as a single yarn, a yarn or a cord with higher twisting,
the Î±-value amounting to 45 to 100, especially 55
 to 90; and also
exhibits at operating pressure an inlay angle of from 54.7 to
90 degrees, especially 60 degrees.
