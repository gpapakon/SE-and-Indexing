<ABSTRACT>
In biogas reactors of the UASB type, the biogas is separated off from the rising wastewater stream by staggered collection hoods in which a free surface is maintained at which gas transfer takes place. In the known cross-sectional shapes of the collection hoods, the free surface area when the water level is high is greatly decreased and gas transfer is correspondingly greatly hindered. According to the invention, therefore, a rectangular profile having a constant free surface area is utilised. The upper side of the collection hoods can be designed in a roof shape as a sliding surface for the sedimenting anaerobic sludge.

<CLAIMS>
Biogas reactor for the anaerobic treatment of waste water, containing at least one 
collection hood dipping into the waste water for biogas formed during the biological 

decomposition of the waste water components, in which is built up and maintained a 
liquid that fluctuates during operation through gas counterpressure, characterized in 

that the collection hood (2) has, at least in the oscillation region of the liquid level, a 
horizontal cross-section that remains constant. 
Biogas reactor according to Claim 1, characterized in that the topside of the collection 
hoods (2) is provided with sloping surfaces (3, 4) that allow the biosludge to slide off. 
Biogas reactor according to Claim 2, characterized in that the sloping surfaces (3, 4) 
are shaped like a roof. 
Biogas reactor according to Claims 2 or 3, characterized in that the sloping surfaces 
are so formed as to be suitable for absorbing flexion and transverse forces.
