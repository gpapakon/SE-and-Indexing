<ABSTRACT>
A molded case circuit breaker modular line strap 
assembly allows three components to be selectively 

interconnected for the different circuit breaker ampere 
ratings. A single component being used with the lower 

ampere ratings with additional components being additively 
assembled to accommodate the increased ampacity 

requirements with the higher ampere ratings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a line strap assembly for
a molded case circuit breaker according to the preamble of claim 1.U.S. Patent 4,754,247 entitled "Molded Case Circuit
Breaker Accessory Enclosure" describes a so-called "integrated"
circuit breaker that provides both circuit
interruption as well as accessory function. This Patent
should be reviewed for its disclosure of an accessory cover
mounted on the circuit breaker cover for providing access
to field-installable accessory devices. The integrated
circuit breaker includes an integrated circuit electronic
trip unit which allows one circuit breaker design to be
used over a wide range of ampere ratings in combination
with a rating plug, also mounted in the circuit breaker
cover. The electronic trip unit is described within U.S.
Patent 4,589,052 and the rating plug is described within
U.S. Patent 4,649,455.The use of common circuit breaker components over a
wide variety of ampere ratings could provide a strain on
the circuit breaker case in the vicinity of the line and
load terminal straps upon short circuit interruption when
operated at high ampere loadings. The large electrodynamic
forces exerted between adjacent line terminal straps and
between adjacent load terminal straps exert corresponding
large stress forces to the underlying case to which the
line and load terminal straps are secured. U.S. Patent
4,975,667 describes a glass-filled plastic inset that
provides added strength to the line and load terminal
straps to thereby allow common circuit breaker components
to be used over a wider range of circuit breaker ampere 
ratings without adding to the circuit breaker cost.US 4086460, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based,
also shows a form of improved line strap construction.The increase in the cost of the copper and silver materials used to
fabricate the line strap components is reflected in the overall circuit breaker
component costs. To reduce the number of components that must be
inventoried, a large line strap that is designed for a 1600 ampere circuit
breaker is also used within an 800 ampere circuit breaker. Since the
remaining components are common within both circuit breaker designs, it
would be cost beneficial to provide a line strap design that can be assembled
from common lower current components and additively assemble the
components to accommodate for the hig her current rating.Accordingly, one purpose of the invention is to provide a circuit
breaker line strap modular assembly whereby the line strap components are
additively

(43) is U-shaped.
The line strap assembly of claim 1 or 2 characterised by
a first aperture (42) formed within the offset (41), a second aperture

(44) formed within the support plate (32) coextensive with the first
aperture (42)and a third aperture (45) formed within the brace (43) co-extensive

with the first and second apertures (42,44).
The line strap assembly of claim 3 characterised by
means (52) extending through the first, second and third apertures

(42,44,45) to fasten the arc runner (30) to the support plate (32) and the
brace (43) whereby the insulative plate (37) is trapped between the arc

runner (30) and the support plate (32).
The line strap assembly of any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised by a lanced part (33) formed on the support plate (32)

supporting a fixed arcing contact (28). 
The line strap assembly of any preceding claim
characterised by a pair of fixed main contacts (29) attached to the

support plate (32).
The line strap assembly of claim 6 characterised by a
tongue (39) formed at one end of the insulating plate (37) and arranged

intermediate the main contacts (29).
The line strap assembly of claim 3 or any claim directly
or indirectly appendant thereto characterised in that the third aperture

(45) comprises a threaded opening.
The line strap assembly of any preceding claim
characterised in that the brace (47) comprises a conductive plate.
The line strap assembly of claim 9
characterised in that the brace (47) is welded or brazed to the support

plate (32).
The line strap assembly of any preceding claim
characterised in that the support plate (32) has an offset (34) at one end

and the brace (43) has a pair of depending tabs (46), the bottom of
which tabs (46) are coextensive with the bottom of the support plate

offset (34).
