<ABSTRACT>
A semi-automated biological sample analyzer and subsystems are provided to simultaneously perform a plurality of enzyme immunoassays form human IgE class antibodies specific to a panel of preselected allergens in each of a plurality of biological samples. A carousel is provided to position and hold a plurality of reaction cartridges (80). Each reaction cartridge (80) includes a plurality of isolated test sites formed in a two dimensional array in a solid phase binding layer contained within a reaction well (86) which is adapted to contain a biological sample to be assayed. The carousel and cartridges (80) contain structures which cooperate to precisely position the cartridges (80) in each of three separate dimensions so that each cartridge (80) is positioned uniformly. An optical reader operating on a principle of diffuse reflectance is provided to read the results of the assays from each test site of each cartridge (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to biological
sample analyzers and more specifically to a semi-automated
analyzer and subsystems thereof capable of simultaneously
carrying out a panel of assays on each of a plurality of
different biological samples. In one aspect, the analyzer of the
invention is adapted to simultaneously assay each of a
plurality of biological fluid samples for human IgE class
antibodies specific to a preselected panel of allergens.A significant portion of the population has some allergic
reaction to substances such as pollen, animal dander, or other
commonly present allergic substances. A key element in the
treatment of such allergic symptoms is identification of the
particular substance to which a person may be allergic.
Previous methods for determining allergic hypersensitivity
were performed using direct skin tests on the patient. In
these direct skin tests minute quantities of various allergens
were injected into or under the patient's skin and the
particular patch of skin was subsequently examined to
determine whether or not a person had an allergic reaction to
the previously introduced allergen.In addition to being uncomfortable for the patient,
patients on certain medications (i.e. antihistamines) cannot be
accurately tested by direct skin tests.Accordingly, a number of in-vitro testing procedures
have been developed. Such procedures detect circulating IgE in
serum or plasma or other microbiological interactions using
an insoluble solid carrier coated with a known quantity of
antigen extract derived from a known allergenic substance.
The coated carrier is typically exposed to, and incubated in, a
sample of the patient's blood serum. If the patient carriers
the IgE class antibody which is specific to the particular
allergen and which is the cause of the patient's allergic
reaction to the allergen, a measurable binding reaction occurs 
on the carrier during the incubation period. The concentration
of the IgE antibody in the sample and accordingly the degree of
allergic sensitivity of the patient is then determined by
measuring the magnitude of the binding reaction either
visually, photometrically, fluorometrically, radiologically,
enzymatically, or by other known techniques.While such in-vitro procedures provide advantages over
in-vivo testing procedures, they are not without
disadvantages. First, a relatively large quantity of blood is
required to test the patient's sensitivity to a large number of
specific allergens. Second, testing for a large number of
different

An apparatus for supporting a plurality of selected
capture reagents, each reactive with a specific assay binding

component of interest in a biological sample, for use in
simultaneously assaying said sample for said assay binding

component, comprising:

a first layer (83) of capture reagent binding material;
a second layer (85) of non-absorbent substrate material
below said first layer (83);
a plurality of test sites (84) formed in said first layer
(83) of capture reagent binding material each adapted to bind a

selected capture reagent; and

not completely through, said first layer (83), and in that the

lower portions (95) of said depressions (89) are hydrophobic,
