Temperature controller for refrigerated products using the principle of the 
solidification and fusion of liquid bodies at ambient temperature to control a temperature 

either between two limits or below or above a threshold temperature, mainly in order to 
monitor refrigerated food products but also for use in all cases where a storage 

temperature must be maintained, for example for pharmaceutical products conditions so 
that the change in the state of the liquid by solidification and fusion, caused by a critical 

temperature being passed, leads to an irreversible and visible modification,
 
   the controller comprises a temperature indicator consisting of a capsule (1) 

entirely filled with a liquid (2) at the ambient storage temperature which increases in 
volume on solidification, characterized in that the said capsule (1) comprising a 

peripheral breakage fuse (3) causing separation into two predefined parts (4, 5) under 
the effect of solution solidification (2), the said capsule (1) enclosing an elastic element 

(6) such as a spring, compressed and arranged so that when it is broken as a result of 
the breakage fuse (3), the elastic element remains compressed so long as the solution is 

solid and expands visible and irreversibly when the said solution liquefies, this latter 
being mixed with one or several additives so that its melting point is at a value related to 

the critical temperature to be monitored. 
Temperature control device as per claim 1 characterized in that, by the 
relaxation of the flexible element (6) due to liquefying of the solution (2), the two 

predefined parts (4, 5) of the capsule (1) are visibly and irreversibly separated one from 
the other. 
Temperature control device as per any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that the capsule (1) is enclosed in an external closed envelope (7), 

which is partly or totally transparent, integral with the product to be checked, with its  
 

packaging or with its refrigerated enclosure, preventing manipulation of the temperature 
indicator but allowing its observation. 
Temperature control device as per claim 3 characterized in that one of the 
predefined parts (4) of the capsule (1) forms an integral part of the envelope (7) wh
ich 
comprises an opaque part (8) to hide the capsule so long as the solution (2) has not 

liquefied and a transparent part (9) which enables the second predefined part (5) to be 
seen when this is moved apart by the flexible element (6) after the solution has melted 

(2). 
Temperature control device as per claim 4 characterized in that the envelope 
(7) is equipped with a magnifying glass (13) positioned at the breakage fuse (3) to allow 

it to be checked. 
Temperature control device as per any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that a temperature indicator containing a liquid (11) which solidifies by 

causing a visible and irreversible phenomenon when the temperature falls below a critical 
low temperature, is associated with the capsule (1), the temperature for solidification of 

the solution (2) contained in this being greater than that of the liquid (11). 
Temperature controller as per claim 6 characterized in that the liquid (11) 
increases in volume by solidifying and causing irreversible movement of an indicator 

(12). 
Temperature controller according to claim 7 characterized in that the 
irreversible movement of the indicator (12) is amplified by a spring which is maintained 

compressed by a trigger or an escape mechanism and freed by the solidification of the 
liquid (11). 
Temperature controller according to any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that movement of the various controller elements caused by the critical 

temperature threshold being passed changes the state of an electrical switch controlling 
an alarm or the recording of the event.
