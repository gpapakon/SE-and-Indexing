<ABSTRACT>
A hacking prevention system for use with a network 
including a transmitter and a multiplicity of receivers, each 

receiver being independently enabled by a secret number and when 
enabled being responsive to data received from the transmitter 

for decrypting encrypted information, each of the multiplicity of 
receivers including: a first key generator, employing at least 

part of the data and a function which differs for at least a 
plurality of ones of the multiplicity of receivers, for 

generating a first key which is different for each receiver 
having a different function, a second key generator employing at 

least part of the data and the function to produce a second key, 
and a secret number generator utilizing the first key with the 

second key to produce the secret number which is the same for all 
of the multiplicity of receivers, whereby first and second keys 

intercepted at a first receiver cannot be effective to enable a 
second receiver having a different function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to secure
communication systems and more particularly to systems wherein
encrypted information is transmitted from a single location to
multiple terminals located at non-secure locations.A major problem in secure communication systems is the
possibility of unauthorized penetration. Unauthorized penetration
of this kind is referred to as hacking.Several methods have been employed to overcome the
problem of hacking. Encryption of transmitted data and
authentication of communicators are some of the methods employed
to make hacking more difficult.One hacking method which is considered difficult to
overcome is called "The McCormac Hack". This method, which is
believed to be theoretically applicable to CATV systems, is
described in the book "World Satellite TV and Scrambling
Methods", 2nd Edition, Baylin Publications 1991, pp. 242 - 244 by
Frank Baylin, Richard Maddox and John McCormac and in "Satellite
Watch News", August 1991. According to this method, a data stream
from a legitimately authorized decoder, is extracted in real time
and transmitted over the air using a small radio-frequency (RF)
transmitter. The data stream is then used to activate a number of
pirate decoders. WO-A-91 11884 describes a decoder for descrambling encoded satellite
transmission. The decoder receives twice-encrypted keys
and performs a first key decryption in a first removable module
in accordance with a secret serial number stored in the first
removable module. The partially decrypted key of the first
removable module is supplied to a second decryptor where the key
is fully decrypted using a further secret serial number stored
in the second decryptor. The arrangement according to WO-A-91
11884 ensures that the replaceable module operates only on a
particular decoder to which the replaceable module has been
assigned.EP-A-343 805 teaches the reproduction of secure keys by using
distributed key generation data.The present invention seeks to provide a system and a method
which substantially prevent the possibility of extracting
a data stream from a legitimately authorized terminal and
transmitting the data stream to a plurality of pirate terminals.For the purposes of the present invention, the term
"terminals" in all of its forms is used in a broader than usual
sense to cover all types of computer terminals, CATV decoders,
remote computers and remote computerized stations.For the purposes of the present invention, the terms
"seed" and "key" in all of their forms are alternately used in a
broader
