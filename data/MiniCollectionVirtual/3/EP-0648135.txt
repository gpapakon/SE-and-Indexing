<ABSTRACT>
An injection device is provided for the infinitely variable metering and administering of a liquid preparation from a multi-dose injection cartridge having a rear piston which may be moved forward by means of a piston rod. The longitudinal movement of the piston rod is governed by two couplings arranged along said piston rod and each being capable of releasably gripping the piston rod by locking means. The piston rod has a wedge-shaped cross section and each of the couplings comprises a clamping shoe which has a wedge-shaped groove, the cross section of which is adapted to that of the piston rod, and lever means, by means of which the piston rod and each clamping shoe may be releasably clamped together to lock the piston rod in the groove of said clamping shoe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a device for 
dosing and administering a liquid preparation. More 
specifically, the invention refers to repeated dosing 
and administering of liquid pharmaceutic preparations 
by parenteral injection from a multi-dose container. 
Still more specifically, the invention refers to a 
device for infinitely variable dosing and administering 
of liquid pharmaceutic preparation by parenteral 
injection from a multi-dose container, such as an injection 
cartridge. In the international patent application WO-A-9308854 
(state of the art according to Article 54(3) EPC) 
is described a method for repeated dosing of a liquid 
preparation of a pharmaceutically active agent by administration 
from a multi-dose container having a defined 
volume. What characterizes this method is that 
the amount of the preparation to be dosed is selected 
to be 1/N of the volume of the multi-dose container, N 
being an integer having a value of 2 or higher. The 
value of N is selected and set before the repeated 
dozing of the preparation from the multi-dose container 
is started, and is maintained unchanged through a 
series of N successive administrations from the multi-dose 
container, which has consequently then been 
emptied. As the other variable is used the concentration 
of the liquid preparation, such that the portion 
1/N will give the desired dose of the pharmaceutically 
active agent. By using a series of containers with 
preparations of different concentrations, and a plurality 
of values for N, it is clear that a great number 
of different doses of the active agent can be obtained. Through the method and system described, it has thus 
become possible to administer a number of doses of a  
 
liquid preparation from a multi-dose container in such 
a way that essentially no residue of the preparation is 
obtained. This is of considerable importance when very 
expensive pharmaceutical agents are to be administered, 
such as growth hormones. The above-mentioned international application WO-A-93/08854 
also discloses a device for the repeated 
dosing of a liquid preparation from a multi-dose container. 
Such a device comprises a holder device for a 
multi-dose container having a defined volume and containing 
a preparation having a defined composition, and 
the multi-dose container is provided with a fixed front 
wall, through which may be arranged an outlet for the 
preparation, and a movable rear wall, which may act as 
a piston for expelling the preparation through said 
outlet, and a

<CLAIMS>
An injection device for infinitely variably 
metering and administering a liquid preparation, 

comprising a holder device for a multi-dose injection 
cartridge (28) which comprises a fixed front wall through 

which may be arranged a liquid connection for discharging 
said preparation, and a rear movable wall 

which may be moved forward by means of a piston rod (1) to 
expel said preparation from the cartridge (28), the movement 

of said piston rod (1) being governed by two couplings (2, 3) 
arranged along the length of said piston rod (1), each of 

said couplings (2, 3) being capable of releasably gripping and 
retaining said piston rod (1) by locking means, and the 

front coupling (2) being stationary in relation to the 
holder device and the injection cartridge (28) and the rear 

coupling (3) being movable rearwards along said piston rod (1) 
against a spring pressure to be locked to the piston 

rod (1) in a rear position, after which the front couplings (2) 
may be released to free the piston rod such that said 

spring pressure will move the piston rod (1) and the rear 
coupling (3) locked thereto forward for a predetermined 

distance and thereby also displace the rear movable 
wall of the injection cartridge (28) forward to expel a 

predetermined amount of the liquid preparation from the 
cartridge (28), wherein the piston rod (1) has a 

wedge-shaped cross-section and wherein each of the couplings 
(2, 3) comprises an clamping shoe (4, 5) having a wedge-shaped 

groove, the cross-section of which is adapted to that 
of the piston rod (1), and lever means (14, 15, 10) arranged in each 

clamping shoe (4, 5), by means of which the piston (1) rod and the 
clamping shoe (4, 5) may be clamped together to lock the 

piston rod (1) to said coupling (2, 3), or the clamping shoe (4, 5) 
may be released from the piston rod (1) to release said 

coupling (3, 4). 
Injection device according to claim 1, wherein 
the holder device at its rear part is 

provided with stopping means (25) which limit the rearward  
 

movement of said rear coupling (3), said stopping means (25) 
being adjustable in the longitudinal direction such 

that said rearward movement may be set at a predetermined 
value. 
Injection device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
a yoke (23) is provided for the rearward 

movement of said rear coupling (3), said yoke (23) being 
connected to the rear coupling (3) and its lever means in 

such a way that said coupling (3) is released from the 
piston rod (1) as it is moved rearwards and is again locked 

to the piston rod (1) after said movement is terminated. 
Injection device according to any of claims 1-3, wherein 
the lever means (8, 14) of the two couplings 

(2, 3) are spring loaded in such a manner that they 
strive to lock each of the couplings (2, 3) to the piston rod (1). 
Injection device according to any of claims 1-4, wherein 
said lever means (8, 14) comprise eccentric 

disks (7, 12), which by being rotated lock the couplings (2, 3) 
to the piston rod (1), or release the couplings from said 

piston rod (1). 
Injection device according to any of claims 1-5, wherein 
a spring-loaded actuating slide (31) 

is arranged in contact with the two lever means (8, 14) and 
comprises a sensor arm (29) for sensing the position of the 

injection cartridge (28) in such a manner that when said 
cartridge (28) is removed from said holder device, the 

actuating slide (31) actuates said lever means (8, 14) to release 
both of said couplings (2, 3) from the piston rod (1) such that it 

may be moved freely in the longitudinal direction, and 
when a new injection cartridge (28) and said rod (1) are 

inserted into said holder device, said cartridge (28) in a 
predetermined position by means of said sensor arm (29) 

displaces said actuating slide (31) in such a manner that 
said lever means (8, 14) lock each of said couplings (2, 3) to the 

piston rod (1).
