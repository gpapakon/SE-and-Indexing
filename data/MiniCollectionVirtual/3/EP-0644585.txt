<ABSTRACT>
Lead frames having inner leads arranged with high 
density are manufactured with high accuracy and at low 

cost. The tip portions of the inner leads are separated 
from one another by wire electrical discharge machining 

(EDM) to the pitch at tip of 0.165 mm to 0.200 mm and the 
width of not less than 0.09 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lead frame used on a 
package for mounting an integrated circuit chip and a 
method of manufacturing the same. A package for mounting an integrated circuit chip or 
integrated semiconductor chip has a lead frame used to 
electrically connect the chip through bonding wires. Such 
a lead frame is made up of a plurality of metallic 
conductor strips that extend radially toward the 
semiconductor chip mounting portion of the package. Each 
conductor strip has an inner lead having a tip to which a 
bonding wire is connected, and an outer lead continued to 
the inner lead and protruding from the package. Conventional lead frames are usually formed by 
stamping with a press. Such stamping requires an expensive 
die. Moreover, it is difficult to form a lead frame having 
a large number of inner leads with high dimensional 
accuracy by stamping, because it is difficult to form a die 
having a complicated shape with high accuracy. It is also known to form a lead frame by photo-etching. 
Photo-etching needs no expensive tools and has 
wider use, but has a problem in that the forming process is 
complicated and thus the manufacturing cost is high. Either of these methods has another problem in that  
 
it is impossible to reduce the distance between the tips of 
the adjacent inner leads to below 90% of the thickness of 
the metal conductors. For example, on a mass-production 
basis, it is impossible to reduce the distance below 0.113 
- 0.115 mm if the thickness of the metal conductors is 
0.125 mm. If a 0.125-mm-thick lead frame has inner leads 
each having a width of 0.115 mm and spaced apart a distance 
of 0.115 mm from each other at their tips, the pitch of the 
leads at the tips will be 0.230 mm. Taking also into 
consideration the size of the semiconductor chip and the 
length of the bonding wires, it will be impossible to form 
a lead frame having more than 260 inner leads by photo-etching 
or stamping. If more than 260 inner leads are needed, one has to 
use a more costly package such as a pin-grid array or other 
bonding method such as tape automated bonding (TAB). But 
the pin-grid array package has a shortcoming in that the 
newest surface mounting technique (SMT) cannot be used. 
TAB tends to be costly if the production lot is small. It 
also requires highly skilled hands in handling and 
assembling. In another known method, inner leads are first formed 
by etching or stamping with their tips still connected 
together. Then, the tips are cut apart from one another 
using a
