<ABSTRACT>
A process serves for composting organic matter (material to be rotted). The material to be composted is biodegraded in a closed vessel with a supply of air. At least some of the exhaust air is fed back to the material to be composted. In order that a process of this type can be carried out without difficulties, the process is controlled in such a way that the relative humidity in the material to be composted is kept between a lower limiting value and an upper limiting value.

Composting process in which the organic matter is biologically degraded in a
closed container with an aeration supply, with at least part of the waste air being

returned to said organic matter,
characterised in that
the process is controlled such that the relative humidity in the organic matter is
maintained between a lower limit value and an upper limit value,
with the a
W
 value (= water vapour partial pressure in the air/water vapour partial
pressure in the air at saturation) in the organic matter during decomposition of the

readily biologically degradable substances being greater than 0.85 and smaller than
1.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the a
W
 value following
decomposition of the readily biologically degradable substances is greater than 0.65

and smaller than 0.85.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the waste air is cooled and
the water vapour contained therein is at least partially condensed out.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that pure oxygen
is admixed to the aeration supply.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that fresh air is
admixed with the aeration supply.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the volume
of air supplied per unit time is adjusted such that the relative humidity in the 

organic matter is maintained within the limit values indicated in Claim 1 and,
where appropriate, in Claim 2.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the enthalpy
of the air supplied is adjusted such that the relative humidity in the organic matter is

maintained within the limits indicated in Claim 1 and, where appropriate, in Claim
2.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the a
W
 value
is adjusted to the maximum possible level within the specified limits.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the relative
humidity in the organic matter is kept at a constant value.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the ratio
between the recycled circulating air flow supplied per unit time to the organic

matter, and the fresh air flow supplied per unit time to the organic matter and/or
pure oxygen flow supplied to the organic matter per unit time is greater than 1 and

preferably lies between 6 and 28.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the CO
2

contained in the waste air is completely or partially removed prior to the complete
or partial recirculation of said waste air to the organic matter.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the volume
of water microbiologically formed during composting is determined and that the

water volume thus ascertained is used for open-loop and/or closed-loop control of
the composting process.
Process according to Claim 12, characterised in that the water content and the
enthalpy in the aeration supply and in the waste air are measured or otherwise 

determined, and that from the result is derived the volume of water
microbiologically formed in the container.
Process according to Claim 12 or 13, characterised in that the reduction in the
weight of the organic matter is measured or otherwise determined.
Process according to one of Claims 3 to 14, characterised in that the cooling
capacity and/or the fan capacity are adjusted so that a certain quantity of condensate

is generated per unit time.
Process according to Claim 15, characterised in that the condensate volume per unit
time to be generated is determined from a specified decomposition rate of, for

example, 20%.
