<ABSTRACT>
A support (1) for a plurality of accelerometers (16, 17) which for example detect the longitudinal and lateral (side) accelerations of a motor vehicle is proposed, which can be produced in one piece by injection moulding. The fitting surfaces (4, 5) are constructed on two mutually perpendicular walls (2, 3) and a third wall (6), on which a support surface 9 is integrally formed, is provided at right angles to the walls (2, 3). Furthermore, the support (1) has pins (10 to 15) which are constructed in the extension of the walls (2, 3) and are electrically connected to contacts (26, 27 or 28) assigned to the fitting surfaces (4, 5).

Holder for acceleration sensors which are produced by 
the micromechanical structure technique and intended for 

the detection of longitudinal and transverse accelerations 
of a vehicle, characterised in that the holder (1) is 

formed by injection moulding as a three-dimensional circuit 
carrier in such a way that at least two mounting surfaces 

(4, 5) intersecting at a right angle are formed, in that 
the mounting surfaces (4, 5) are equipped with contacts 

(26, 27, 28), and in that projections (10 to 15) pointing 
in one and the same direction are moulded on in such a way 

that they are formed at right angles with respect to a 
plane relative to which two mounting surfaces (4, 5) form 

a right angle, and in that the projections (10 to 15) are 
electroconductively connected to the contacts (26, 27, 28) 

of the mounting surfaces (4, 5). 
Holder according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
mounting surfaces (4, 5) are formed to [sic]
 on two walls 
(2, 3) situated at right angles to one another, and in that 

a third wall (6) is provided, onto which a supporting 
surface (9) is moulded at right angles to the mounting 

surfaces (4, 5). 
Holder according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
is moulded in the shape of a box (33) in such a way that 

mounting surfaces situated at right angles to one another 
are formed at least on two walls (37, 38), the mounting 

surfaces in turn being situated at right angles to a 
supporting surface (39) of the holder (33). 
Panel having a plurality of holders according to Claim 
1, characterised in that the panel is produced in a multi-impression 

mould in such a way that the mounting surfaces 
of each individual holder (1, 33) in the interconnected 

panel structure are accessible at least for the deposition  
 

of conductor tracks. 
Panel according to Claim 4, characterised in that a 
plurality of holders (33) are formed on a panel board (44) 

in parallel pairs each offset from one another by the 
length of a holder (33) and are connected to the panel 

board (44) via webs (45, 46, 47, 48) preferably provided at 
the corners. 
Panel according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
preferably four holders (1) are assigned to one another in 

such a way that respectively one mounting surface of two 
holders (1) lie in one plane, and in that a central sprue 

(31) is provided, to which the holders (1) are connected 
via webs.
