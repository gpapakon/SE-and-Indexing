A process for carrying out distillative separations by a batchwise procedure, in which a plurality of fractions are separated
off together from a starting mixture and the resulting top and bottom mixtures are further separated in downstream

batchwise distillations, wherein
the distillation column (1) is connected, at

both the top and the bottom end, to a container (2; 7) and the starting mixture to be separated is fed via the container
(2) connected to the top end of the distillation column (1), and the low-boiling fraction is removed from this

end, and, in a subsequent separation step, the medium boiler is separated off by distillation from the mixture collected 
in the bottom container (7) and consisting of medium-boiling and high-boiling fraction and is removed via the

top end of the distillation column (1), the medium-boiling fracfion accounting for at least 70 % by weight of the starting
mixture to be separated.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the starting mixture initially taken at room temperature at the beginning
of the separation is heated in a heat exchanger with the heat of condensation of the vapor at the top of the distillation

column.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a storage tank which is connected to the top end of the distillation
column serves as a receiver for the starting mixture to be separated.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein two distillation apparatuses are used, in the first apparatus
the mixture to be separated being fed to the top of the column, the mixture consisting of medium boiler and high

boiler being removed at the bottom end and fed to the bottom of the second distillation apparatus, and the medium-boiling
fraction being separated off there via the top.
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the bottom product of the first column is not completely emptied but the
minimum content required for operation of the evaporator is left at elevated temperatures in the bottom container

and is used as an initial content for the next batch.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the starting mixture to be separated is initially taken at room
temperature in the receiver connected to the top of the column and is fed to the top of the column at a flow rate

which is constant as a function of time, the condensed vapors are introduced into the receiver without cooling and
are mixed with the content thereof, and the amount of liquid contained is gradually heated up, with the result that

the liquid which flows out of the receiver and is introduced as reflux at the top of the column exhibits decreasing

cooling and a bottom outflow which decreases as a function of time and has a virtually constant concentration is
thus obtained.
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the condensed vapors are collected as a top layer in the receiver, as far
as possible without mixing with the colder liquid which therefore has a higher specific gravity.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the amount of liquid fed to the top of the column is adjusted
by regulation so that a bottom concentration which is constant as a function of time is obtained in the first distillation

phase, in which the medium-boiling and high-boiling fraction is separated off at the bottom, and a top concentration
which is constant as a function of time is obtained in the second distillation phase, in which the medium-boiling fraction

is separated off via the top.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the mixture to be separated consists of from 0.1 to 4 % by
weight of butanediol, from 0.1 to 4 % by weight of butynediol, from 0.1 to 4 % by weight of high-boiling residue and

from 88 to 99.7 % by weight of butenediol.
