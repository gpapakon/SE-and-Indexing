<ABSTRACT>
A known drilling tool has a removable centring drill, which can easily fall out of its mounting when the drilling tool is placed in position. The centring drill is to be prevented from falling out of its mounting. The drilling tool according to the invention is designed as a core drill bit (2) with a centre axis (3) and cutting-edge carrier (4) and has at its front end face cutting segments (6) and slots (10) open at the margin. The slots (10) run at an angle to the direction of the centre axis (3) and serve to accommodate fastening arms of a centring drill to be inserted into the core drill bit. On account of the angled arrangement of the slots, the fastening arms are advantageously held in the slots (10) during rotation of the drilling tool.

having a hollow-cylindrical annular bit (2) and a 

centring-drill insert (12) which is held concentrically 
in the annular bit (2) and has at least three arms (15) 

which project laterally in a star shape and can be 
inserted into slots (10), open at the margin, of the 

annular bit (2), characterized in that the slots (10) are 
arranged obliquely to the direction of the centre axis 

(3) of the annular bit (2).

in that the slots (10) run at an angle of about 20 - 30Â° 

obliquely to the direction of the centre axis (3). 
Drilling tool according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the width of the slots (10) corresponds 

to the diameter of the arms (15). 
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the arms (15) are accommodated 

in the slots (10) by a sliding fit. 
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the slots (10) are approximately 

twice as long as they are wide. 
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding 

claims, characterized in that the arms (15) project only 
slightly beyond the cutting-edge carrier (4).
