<ABSTRACT>
Base Station Transceiver Equipment (10) is provided such as for 
use in a cellular radio telephone system (fig. 3). A receiver (32) associated 

with a first base station transmitter in a first cell has means for 
monitoring a parameter of transmissions from a second base station 

transmitter (34-38) remotely located from the first base station 
transmitter. The receiver further comprises means for reporting, to a 

central management centre (40) responsible for the operational control of 
base stations (32-28) in the cellular radio communications system, if a 

change in said parameter is detected. The operation management centre 
(40) has means for determining whether the reported change in said 

parameter is due to a fault in the second base station transmitter and not 
to a specific operational change anticipated by the operation management 

centre.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to base station transceiver equipment for 
communication with a mobile transceiver in a radio communication 
system, such as a cellular radio system. The invention particularly 
relates to diagnostic equipment for testing certain aspects of the operation 
of such equipment. In the GSM Pan-European Digital Cellular Telephone System, base 
stations transmit commands to mobile units to instruct the mobile units 
precisely when to transmit their messages to the base stations. A base 
station measures the time of receipt of messages from mobiles 
communicating with it. If messages are being received from a mobile at 
times which are early or late with respect to that mobile's assigned time 
slots, the base station transmits a command to that mobile to instruct that 
mobile to retard or advance its transmissions respectively. Since it is a feature of the system that communications can be 
maintained with the mobile units while those units are in motion, it is 
necessary to continually measure the time of receipt of messages from a 
mobile and continually instruct the mobile to retard or advance its 
transmissions. Thus, if a mobile moves from a position distant from a 
base station to a position closer to that base station while communicating 
therewith, the propagation delay of its transmissions will be reduced, and 
its messages will be received at the base station in advance of its assigned 
time slots. In such circumstances the base station commands the mobile 
to retard its transmissions to compensate for the reduced propagation 
delay. Conversely, if a mobile moves significantly away from its base 
station, it must advance its transmissions. The above timing adjustment routine is described in flow-chart 
form in Figure 1. When a mobile is switched on, ready for transmission 
(step 1), it receives the synchronisation signal transmissions from the 
nearest base station and synchronises to this (step 2). Once 
synchronised, the mobile transmits to the base station as shown is step 3. 
The mobile commences transmission with a predetermined timing 
advance relative to the timing established from sychronisation. In step 4, 
the base station measures the actual timing advance. The actual timing 
advance measured will depend upon the propagation delay. In step 5, the  
 
base station asks the mobile what is its current timing advance. At the 
start of the transmission, the current timing advance will be the 
predetermined timing advance. As shown in step 6, the base station 
calculates
