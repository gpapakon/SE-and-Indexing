<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device and a method for operating 
the same comprises a first P-type semiconductor layer 

(11) and a first N-type semiconductor layer (12) provided 
thereon. A plurality of second P-type semiconductor 

layers (13) and a plurality of third P-type 
semiconductor layers (14) are formed on the surface of 

the first N-type semiconductor layer (12). A plurality 
of second N-type semiconductor layers (15) are formed on 

their respective surfaces of the third P-type semiconductor 
layers (14). Emitter electrodes (16) are provided 

on the second P-type semiconductor layers (13) and 
second N-type semiconductor layers (15). A plurality of 

first gate electrodes (18) is each provided above the 
first N-type semiconductor layer (12) between the adjacent 

third P-type semiconductor layers (14). A plurality 
of second gate electrodes (20) is each provided 

above the first N-type semiconductor layer (12) between 
the second P-type semiconductor layer (13) and the third 

P-type semiconductor layer (14). A collector electrode 
(21) is provided under the first P-type semiconductor 

layer (11). If the timing at which a bias is applied to 
the first gate electrodes (18) and second gate electrodes 

(20) is controlled, an operation mode in which the 
device serves as a thyristor and an operation mode in 

which the device serves as an IGBT can be switched to 
each other. Therefore, the semiconductor device, which 

can be turned on/turned off, is capable of being turned 
off at high speed when an on-state voltage is low.
