<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a platform lift (1) with a platform (3) and additional hoisting equipment. The platform is mounted at least on an upright (2) so that it can be displaced vertically the upright consisting of elements (2a) fitted one on top of the other. In order to make working on the platform easier, a travelling crane located above the platform (3) is used as the hoisting equipment, the travelling crane having a support girder (6) extending substantially over the whole length of the platform plus a trolley (7) which can be driven back and forth along a trackway (6a) on the support girder.

<CLAIMS>
A lifting platform (1) comprising a platform (3) 
supported so as to be vertically movable on at least 

one mast (2) assemblable from superposed mast elements 
(2a) and a hoist disposed above the platform (3), the 

hoist being a travelling crane (4) with a girder (6, 
12) extending substantially over the entire length of 

the platform and a trolley movable in reciprocation 
along a runway (6a, 14) on the crane girder, 

characterised in that the crane girder (6, 12) is 
disposed in the region of the inner longitudinal edge 

(8) of the platform (3) facing the building and the 
runway (6a, 14) is in the form of arcuate portions (9, 

15) around the mast (2) on the outer side remote from 
the building. 
A lifting platform according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the arcuate portions (9, 15) are 

connected by points (10, 16) to the straight portions 
(11, 17) extended on both sides towards the masts (2). 
A lifting platform according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the arcuate portions (15) in the 

apical region (15a) extend beyond the outer 
longitudinal edge (18) of the platform (3) remote from 

the building. 
A lifting platform according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the crane girder (12) is 

supported on the upper or uppermost elements (2b) of 
the mast (2).  

 
A lifting platform according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the crane girder (12) has 

transversely adjustable extension arms (13) for holding 
the runway (14).
