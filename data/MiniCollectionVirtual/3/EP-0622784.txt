<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium comprises a nonmagnetic base, on which are formed an electron-cured magnetic resin layer 
containing dispersed ferromagnetic powder and an electron-cured resin backcoating. The present invention uses an electron-curable 

vinyl chloride resin having sulfur-containing polar group in combination with an electron-curable urethane resin having a 
phosphorus-containing polar group. In this way, the dispersion of ferromagnetic powder, surface flatness and electromagnetic 

conversion characteristics can be improved. Further, an error rate can be reduced in high density digital recording. Further, storage 
property is excellent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording medium of
the coating type.Magnetic recording media of the coating type have a
magnetic layer of ferromagnetic powder dispersed in a binder on
a non-magnetic substrate. The binders used are generally
classified into a thermosetting type and an electron beam
curing type. Binders of the electron beam curing type are
advantageous for large scale production because of possible on-line
curing after coating and orientation, but are low in
dispersion of ferromagnetic powder, less liable to calendering
and other processing after coating, and not necessarily
satisfactory in electromagnetic characteristics as compared
with binders of the thermosetting type. They have the
disadvantages of poor electromagnetic characteristics and high
error rates especially in the case of high sensitivity digital
recording as employed in digital audio tape recorders (DAT).For increasing the dispersibility in binders of the
electron beam curing type, it was proposed in the art to use
electron beam-curable resins having various polar groups
(Japanese Patent Application Kokai (JP-A) Nos. 40744/1982,
40745/1982, 29145/1983, 29146/1983, 100222/1983, 92421/1982,
205927/1983, 8126/1983, 79427/1983, 146440/1983, 63221/1985,
120765/1985, 922/1986, 77134/1986, 89207/1986, 6430/1987,
28925/1987, 42322/1987, 43830/1987, 84422/1987, 88135/1987,
95724/1987, 267827/1989, 40615/1987, 195720/1987, 67314/1992, 
etc.). These binders, however, did not achieve satisfactory
improvements and attempts were made to use two or more electron
beam-curable resins having a polar group in combination (JP-A
127225/1984 246917/1986, 75071/1988, 279420/1988, 49122/1989,
92926/1989, 144210/1989, 68713/1990, etc.). All these prior
art combinations were unsuccessful in achieving a satisfactory
improvement in dispersion.On the other hand, various magnetic tapes include a
backcoat layer on the rear surface thereof remote from the
magnetic layer for improving run, durability, and storage
property. One typical backcoat-forming resin used in the prior
art is a thermosetting combination of nitrocellulose and
urethane resin to be crosslinked with polyisocyanate. This is
because the nitrocellulose/urethane system is fully rigid and
highly effective for preventing blocking between the magnetic
layer and the backcoat layer in a hot humid environment.However, the thermosetting type backcoat layer of this
nitrocellulose/urethane system is low in dispersion of carbon
black which is added for antistatic purposes, resulting in a
rough
