<ABSTRACT>
A printer processor (11a,11e), a film processor (11b,11f), 
and a densitometer (11c) 

are connected to a personal computer (13) via a port controller (12). 
For diagnosing the operation condition of a photographic 

equipment, a check sample is formed by the photographic 
equipment. The check sample is set to the d
ensitometer to 
fetch the measured density data into the personal computer (13). If 

the operation condition of the photographic equipment is 
abnormal, the personal computer fetches the operation data 

under management in the photographic equipment to determine a 
countermeasure against the abnormal state. The countermeasure 

is transferred to the photographic equipment to automatically 
adjust the adjust failure element. In order to remotely 

control a plurality of lab shops, each lab shop is provided 
with a sub-computer connected to the photographic equipment. 

The headquarters are provided with a main computer (191) storing 
therein a management program. The main computer (191) fetches the 

data of the sub-computer via a communication line. In 
accordance with the fetched data, the headquarters (190) remotely 

control the quality, production state, and stock state of 
consumable goods at each lab shop. 

The port controller (12) finds 
an idle time of a CPU at each lab shop, and fetches the data 

from the photographic equipment during the idle time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for remotely
controlling the operation condition of a photographic equipment
and the production and quality at a lab shop, and more
particularly to a remote management system suitable for
centralized management of a plurality of minilab shops.A compact and economical photographic equipment (such as a
printer processor and a film processor) called a minilab
equipment has been recently used widely. Such a minilab
equipment is often installed, for example, within a supermarket
at a minilab department (minilab shop) to provide photoprinting
services as a sideline. Even an operator having less
photofinishing knowledge can make a properly finished
photographic print (photoprint) using a minilab equipment
having automated functions.It is necessary to check and adjust a photographic equipment in
order to attain a proper quality of a photoprint. A minilab
equipment is usually operated by an operator with
photofinishing knowledge insufficient for proper check and
adjustment. Therefore, photofinishing may sometimes be carried
out under improper conditions of the equipment. Such a case may
also occur even at a large lab having a number of experts, if a
plurality of causes are complicated. In order to ensure a
proper quality of a photoprint, an operation condition
management system and/or a quality management system is
provided independently to both a minilab shop and a large lab
to analyze a trouble or adjustment failure of a photographic
equipment. This management system is constituted by a personal
computer and an analysis program, and is used at the start of a
daily work, at the time of a poorly finished print, or as a
routine work. In using this management system, a control strip
supplied from a film maker is first developed in a printer
processor. Then, the developed control strip is measured with a
densitometer to obtain density data. The density data is 
inputted into a personal computer through its keyboard so that
the operation condition of a processor in the printer processor
can be diagnosed from the finished quality of the control
strip. If the operation condition is abnormal, the causes of
trouble or adjustment failure are analyzed and displayed on the
screen of the personal computer. The operator checks the
displayed causes and adjusts the processor to have a proper
condition. It is therefore possible to make a photoprint having
a good quality by using the printer processor which recovered a
normal operation condition.The operation condition is different with

<CLAIMS>
A management method for managing the operational condition of at least one
photographic processor (11a, 11b, 11e, 11f) remotely, said method comprising the

following steps:

connecting said at least one photographic processor (11a, 11b, 11e, 11f) and a
separate independent densitometer (11c) to a computer (13) via a port controller (12)

comprising a switch unit (170) for selecting one device from said at least one
photographic processor (11a, 11 b, 11e, 11f) and said densitometer (11c), for

performing data communication; a first communication control unit (171) for finding
an idle time of a CPU (63, 120, 146, 162) incorporated in said selected device, and

performing data communication at the data transfer speed of said CPU (63, 120,
146, 162) during said idle time; a buffer memory (88, 161, 172) for storing said data

fetched irregularly from said selected device; a subject communication discriminator
unit (173) for discriminating whether said data in said buffer memory (88, 161, 172) to

be transferred to said computer (13) is the data of said selected device requested by
said computer (13); a data format converter unit (174) for converting said data read

from said buffer memory (88, 161, 172) into a data format of said computer (13); and
a second communication control unit (175) for transferring said format-converted

data in blocks to said computer (13) at the transfer speed of said computer (13);
obtaining measured density data with said densitometer (11c) by measuring a check
sample (49) made as final product by said at least one photographic processor (11a,

11b, 11e, 11f); 
diagnosing the operational condition of said at least one photographic processor
(11a, 11b, 11e, 11f) by fetching said measured density data into said computer (13)

and by analyzing said measured density data, whether they are within a
predetermined range of normal operational conditions; and,
if said operational conditions are found to be abnormal, further:

determining a countermeasure by fetching associated data from said at least one
photographic processor (11a, 11b, 11e, 11f);
transferring said countermeasure to said at least one photographic processor (11a,
11b, 11e, 11f); and
