<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved
catheterization systems and, more particularly, to a
compact and bloodless system for introducing an
over-the-needle catheter into a blood vessel utilizing a
wire guide.Over the years, many systems have been used for
introducing a catheter into a blood vessel using a wire
to guide the catheter into the vessel. One system
involves the use of a hollow introducer needle having an
over-the-needle catheter mounted thereon. After the
bevelled tip of the introducer needle is inserted into
the blood vessel, as indicated by "flashback" (i.e., the
flow of blood from the punctured vessel through the
hollow needle and out the proximal end thereof), a wire
guide is fed through the hollow introducer needle and
advanced until the desired length of the wire guide is
within the blood vessel. The catheter is then advanced
off of the introducer needle onto the wire guide and
into the blood vessel.Another system is shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,417,886 entitled "Catheter Introduction Set" ("the 
'886 Patent"), which discloses a catheter introduction
set for the introduction of an over-the-needle catheter
into a relatively small diameter blood vessel. The set
includes a hollow needle, an over-the-needle catheter,
and a wire guide with the needle and wire guide
contained in a single unit. The catheter is carried on
the hollow needle and the wire guide is located within
the hollow needle. After puncturing the vessel using
the needle, blood flashback is visualized in the clear
hub of the introducer needle (to provide a positive
indication that the needle is actually within the
vessel) and the wire guide is then advanced through the
hollow needle and into the blood vessel. The
over-the-needle catheter is then advanced off of the
needle, onto the wire guide and into the vessel, after
which the inserter unit (the introducer needle and the
wire guide) is removed from the inserted catheter and
may be thrown away. The placed catheter is connected to
a stop cock, injection cap or to an appropriate
connecting tubing. Although the set described in the
'886 Patent has enjoyed success, aspects thereof require
improvement, particularly with respect to the size of
the system, the desirability of instantaneously
visualizing flashback and the ever increasing
requirement of developing patient care systems which
minimize contact by healthcare workers with patient
fluids including, principally, blood. A catheterization system which exhibits some of
the advantages of the '886 Patent is shown in U.S.
Patent No.

<CLAIMS>
A system for introducing an over-the-needle
catheter into a blood vessel comprising


a body (22),
a hollow needle body (70) having a proximal end (70a)
connected to said body and formed with a distal needle tip

(70b) and at least one port (70d) close to said needle tip,
a catheter body (92) having a lumen (92c) terminating
at a distal catheter tip (92b), said catheter body adapted

to be carried on said needle body and being dimensioned in
relation to said needle body such that, upon placement of

said catheter body over said needle body, said catheter
body and said needle body cooperating to form a first

flashback chamber (106) therebetween, said first chamber
being in communication with the interior of said needle

body through said port, said catheter body being at
least partially translucent to enable the visualization of

blood flow into said first chamber upon insertion of said
needle tip into a blood vessel, and
a guide wire (16) having a
distal end (16b), is slidably mounted in said body and

within said needle body,
characterized in that the guide wire (16) is

dimensioned in relation to said
needle body to provide a blood flow passage therebetween,

said guide wire being movable between a first position in
which its distal end is wholly within said needle body and

a second position in which said distal end extends beyond
said needle tip, and wherein a second flashback chamber

(38, 40) is formed in said body and connected to said 
needle body to receive blood flow upon insertion of said

needle tip into a blood vessel.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein when said
guide wire is in said first position, said distal end is in

a clearance position with respect to said port.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said second
chamber includes venting means (44, 46) to allow air to

escape from said second chamber but not blood.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said body
(22) includes mounting means for slidably receiving said

guide wire including a partition (52) having a guide wire
opening (54 ), said guide wire being disposed through said

guide wire opening with a sliding fit which precludes blood
flow therethrough.
A system as claimed in Claim 4 wherein said
partition extends in a direction substantially transverse

to the path of movement of said guide wire.
A system as claimed in Claim 5 wherein said
partition is arranged to divert the flow of flashback blood

from said needle body to said second chamber.
A system as claimed in Claim 4 wherein said body
includes a track (42) formed therein and terminating at one

end in said partition, said guide wire having a proximal
end (16a) extending into said track and connected to an

actuator (20) slidably mounted in said track.
A system as claimed in Claim 7 in which said
actuator includes a lever which extends external to said

body for moving said guide wire. 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein

said catheter body (92) is removably carried on said
needle body (70);

and
an inserter unit (12) includes said body (22) having
a blood flashback chamber, (38, 40),
said guide wire (16) having
means (20) on said body for mounting said guide wire

thereon for movement between said retracted position in which
said guide wire distal tip is within said needle body and

said extended position in which said guide wire distal tip
extends beyond said needle tip.
A system as claimed in Claim 9 wherein said means
on said body for mounting said guide wire includes a track

(42) formed in said body and an actuator (20) slidably
mounted in said track and operatively connected to said

guide wire.
A system as claimed in Claim 10 wherein said track
has proximal and distal track ends (42a, 42b) and said body

includes a partition closing said distal end of said track, 
said partition being formed with a partition op
ening
through which said guide wire extends, said partition

opening being dimensioned to provide a sliding fit with
said guide wire whereby said track is effectively blocked

from receiving flashback blood flowing through into said
flashback chamber.
A system as claimed in Claim 11 wherein said
proximal track end is opened such that said actuator and

guide wire may be removed from said body.
A system as claimed in Claim 12 including detent
means (66) on said body and said actuator for releasably

retaining said actuator against movement in said track and
retaining said guide wire in said retracted position.
A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a needle
assembly (14) includes said hollow needle body (70), said hollow needle

body defining a needle bore (70c) terminating at the
distal needle tip (70b),


a catheter assembly (18) includes said catheter body

said guide wire (16) being, in said retracted position,

substantially clear of said 
port (70d) and contiguous to said needle tip (70b),

catheter assembly is placed in a blood vessel.
A system as claimed in Claim 14 wherein said
