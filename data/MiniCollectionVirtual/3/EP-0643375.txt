<ABSTRACT>
Door chime assembly includes a chime base (2) having a rear 
plate (3) and at least one resonance chamber (5) secured to said rear 

plate, a tone bar (9) within the chamber and a striking means (6,7) 
mounted 

on the plate for striking the tone bar. The chime base is molded 
in a single piece and employs at least one living hinge (17,20) which 

permits folding of parts of the assembly to form the resonance 
chamber. The tone bar is mounted on dowels (25) in the chamber of a 

length which prevents the tone bar from falling off the dowels 
during transit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a door chime
assembly.Door chimes are well known in the art and
typically include a chime base holding one or more
tone bars and a striking means to strike the tone
bars, which vibrate with a predetermined tone.
Conventional chime bases also include one or more
sound or resonance chambers which amplify the tone
bar vibration. Conventional door chime bases,
particularly the sound or resonance chambers, are
typically made of several component parts, which
require handling and assembly. Even for chime bases
made by injection molding, as disclosed in DE-B-1257040
and equivalent GB-A-958038 of March 3rd 1965
cited in the examination of this application, a
separate piece is necessary to enclose each sound
chamber. These extra pieces add to the amount of
handling required to assemble each door chime.DE-B-1257040 discloses a door chime assembly
comprising a one-piece chime base including a rear
plate and a plurality of walls integrally formed
with the plate which walls define with a separate
sealing plate cemented thereto a resonance chamber;
a tone bar positioned within said resonance chamber
and electrically operably striking means mounted on 
said chime base for striking said tone bar and
causing it to vibrate.DE-U-1877406 of August 8th 1963, also cited
during the examination of this application,
discloses an assembly comprising a manually actuated
bell housed in box formed by folding of a single
piece of cardboard.One object of the invention is to reduce the
number of component parts required to assemble a
door chime, particularly by reducing the number of
component parts in the door chime base.The present invention provides a door chime
assembly comprising:
a one-piece chime base including a rear plate
and a plurality of walls secured to said plate and
defining a resonance chamber,a tone bar housed within said resonance chamber;
andelectrically operable striking means mounted on
said chime base for striking said tone bar and
causing it to vibrate, said door chime assembly being characterised in that
at least one of said walls is pivotally attached to said rear plate by
a hinge.Preferably, in said assembly defined in the
last preceding paragraph another one of said walls 
is secured to said rear plate and said one of said
walls or a portion thereof is pivotable between a
first position in which it extends at an angle to
said another wall and a second position in which it
extends substantially parallel to said another wall,
and said assembly further comprises clasp means
acting

<CLAIMS>
A door chime assembly (1) comprising:

a one-piece chime base (2) including a rear plate (3) and
a plurality of walls (11,12-13,15,16) secured to said plate and

defining a resonance chamber (5),
a tone bar (9) housed within said resonance chamber (5);
and
electrically operable striking means (6) mounted on
said chime base for striking said tone bar and causing

it to vibrate, said door chime assembly being characterised in that
at least one of said walls (12-13) is pivotally attached to said

rear plate (3) by a hinge (17).
A door chime assembly as set forth in claim 1,
wherein another one (11) of said walls is secured to said

rear plate, wherein said one (12-13) of said walls or a portion
(12) thereof is

pivotable between a first position in which it extends
at an angle to said another wall (11) and a second position

in which it extends substantially parallel to said
another wall (11), and further comprising clasp means (19)

acting between said one wall (12-13) and said another wall (11) for
maintaining said one wall in said second position.
A door chime assembly as set forth in claim 2,
wherein said one wall comprises two portions (12,13) at right 

angles to each other, wherein one (12) of said portions is
pivotally attached to said rear plate and an edge of

the other (13) of said portions is adjacent said another
wall (11) when said one wall is in said second position,

and wherein said clasp means comprises straps (19)
pivotally attached to one of said other portion (13) and

said another wall (11) and projections (22) engageable with said
straps secured to the other of said other portion and

said another wall.
