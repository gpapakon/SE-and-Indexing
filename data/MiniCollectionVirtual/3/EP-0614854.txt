<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of compositions based on mixed zirconium and cerium oxides having high and thermally stable specific surfaces, the said process being characterised in that it comprises the following stages: (i) a zirconium sol, on the one hand, and a cerium sol, on the other hand, are mixed in the stoichiometric proportions corresponding to those of the desired final composition, the ratio r of the mean diameter r1 of the particles constituting the zirconium sol to the diameter r2 of the particles constituting the cerium sol being at least 5, (ii) a base is added to the mixture thus obtained, (iii) the precipitate thus formed is recovered and finally (iv) the precipitate thus recovered is calcined. The invention also relates to the compositions based on mixed oxides of high specific surfaces (
>
10 m
<

A process for the synthesis of a composition based on mixed oxides
of zirconium and cerium, characterised in that it comprises the following

steps:

(i) mixing in stoichiometric proportions corresponding to those of the
desired final composition a zirconium sol on the one hand and a cerium sol

on the other hand, the ratio r between the mean diameter r
1
 of the particles
constituting said zirconium sol and the diameter r
2
 of the particles
constituting said cerium sol being at least 5,
(ii) adding a base to the resulting mixture,
(iii) recovering the precipitate formed in that way, and
(iv) then calcining the precipitate which is recovered in that way.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the mean
diameter of the particles constituting said zirconium sol is between 5 nm

and 500 nm.
A process according to claim 2 characterised in that said mean
diameter is between 10 nm and 200 nm.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the mean diameter of the particles constituting said

cerium sol is between 3 nm and 100 nm.
A process according to claim 4 characterised in that said mean
diameter is between 5 nm and 50 nm.

characterised in that said ratio r is greater than or equal to 10. 
A process according to claim 6 characterised in that said ratio r
is greater than or equal to 20.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims

particular magnesium, calcium and barium; aluminium; silicon; thorium;

scandium; gallium; boron; titanium; vanadium; niobium; tantalum; chromium;
and bismuth.

characterised in that said base is ammonia, sodium hydroxide or potassium

hydroxide.

also contains, expressed in the form of oxide, from 0.1 to 20% by weight and

preferably from 1 to 10% by weight of an above-mentioned doping element.
