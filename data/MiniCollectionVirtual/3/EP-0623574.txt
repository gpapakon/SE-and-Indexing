<ABSTRACT>
An improved alkylene oxide isomerization catalyst and process 
are disclosed. The catalyst comprises lithium phosphate and a 

neutral inorganic support. A key feature of the invention is 
that the lithium phosphate is distributed homogeneously and 

principally on the surface of the support. The catalyst exhibits 
exceptionally high productivities in the conversion of propylene 

oxide to allyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to catalysts for isomerizing alkylene 
oxides to allylic alcohols, and to alkylene 
oxide isomerization processes that employ the catalysts The discovery that alkylene oxides rearrange to give allylic 
alcohols in the presence of basic lithium phosphate catalysts 
sparked years of industrial research aimed at improving catalyst 
lifetime and productivity. Allyl alcohol, the simplest allylic 
alcohol, is produced by isomerizing propylene oxide. Allyl 
alcohol is converted to useful allyl derivatives or is modified 
to give 1,4-butanediol and its derivatives. Two general isomerization processes are known: the gas-phase 
process (see for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,044,850 and 
4,720,598) and the slurry-phase process (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 
3,274,121). In the gas-phase process, the alkylene oxide is 
passed through supported or unsupported lithium phosphate at 
elevated temperatures, and the allylic alcohol is recovered and 
purified by distillation. A major drawback of the gas-phase 
process is that nonvolatile by-products accumulate on the 
catalyst surface over time and rapidly stifle catalyst activity.  The slurry-phase process, which is practised commercially, 
was developed to overcome the catalyst deactivation problems of 
the gas-phase process. In the slurry-phase process, lithium 
phosphate is suspended in a high-boiling oil. During the 
reaction, a portion of the catalyst suspension is continuously 
removed and centrifuged to separate the tar-containing oil from 
the catalyst. Tars are distilled from the oil, the lithium 
phosphate is washed with acetone, and the purified catalyst 
components are recycled to the reactor. Major problems with the 
slurry-phase process include catalyst loss and high oil 
consumption (about 15 pounds of oil per 1000 pounds of allyl 
alcohol produced). Low catalyst productivity is a problem common to both the 
gas- and slurry-phase isomerization processes. In spite of many 
efforts to improve productivity by varying the catalyst 
preparation method or process conditions, only marginal 
productivity improvements have resulted. The best processes 
known have catalyst productivities less than or equal to about 
1.5 kilograms of allylic alcohol produced per kilogram of lithium 
phosphate per hour (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,274,121). U.S. Patent No. 4,720,598 teaches that high surface area 
lithium phosphate supported on α-alumina is an effective catalyst 
for gas-phase isomerization of propylene oxide to allyl alcohol.
