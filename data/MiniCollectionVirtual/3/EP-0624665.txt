<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing fibres by spinning a resin by a centrifugal spinning process comprises supplying a resin solution having a viscosity from 50 to 200 Pa.s to a whirler plate and ensuring that the resin solution is under a sufficient pressure to completely fill the nozzles of the whirler plate as the fibres are being spun. The process is particularly suitable for producing fibres based on amino resins. In the apparatus the supply line for the resin is preferably located within the driveshaft.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing fibers by spinning a
resin by a centrifugal spinning process, which comprises

supplying a resin solution having a viscosity from 50 to
200 Pa.s at the spinning temperature to a whirler plate

(1) and ensuring that inside the whirler plate (1) the
resin solution is under a sufficient pressure to

completely fill the nozzles of the whirler plate (1) as
the fibers are being spun.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the resin
to be spun is supplied to the whirler plate (1) by the

driveshaft (2).
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the
fibers are spun under a pressure p upstream of the nozzle

(9) from 10 to 80 bar calculable by equation I


from the density œÅ of the resin solution, the circumferential
speed v and the internal diameter D
i
 and the
external diameter D
e
 of the liquid ring formed in the
whirler plate (1).
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3
wherein at least one dry air stream is passed from above

the whirler plate along the driveshaft (2) in the
direction of the whirler plate (1) and away from there

toward the outside.
A process as claimed in claim 4 wherein at least
two dry air streams are passed through lines disposed at

different distances from the driveshaft, the velocity of
the air stream adjacent to the driveshaft being greater 

than the velocity of the air streams further away.
Apparatus for producing fibers by a centrifugal
spinning process, comprising a supply line (3) for the

resin in the driveshaft (2), a whirler plate (1) and a
driveshaft (2) for the whirler plate (1), wherein the

upper opening of the whirler plate (1) is sealingly
connected to the driveshaft (2) and in addition the

whirler plate (1) is closed except for the exit openings
(9) for the fibers to be spun and the overflow holes (6)

and the outer edge of the whirler plate is equipped with
wings (7) and (8).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein at least
one shaft (4) for supplying the dry air is arranged above

the whirler plate and concentrically around the
driveshaft.
