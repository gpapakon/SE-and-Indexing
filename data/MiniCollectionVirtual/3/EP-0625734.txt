<ABSTRACT>
A two component development system includes developer with 
charged toner particles and oppositely charged carrier particles having 

high coercivity and permanent magnetism. The developer is moved 
through a development zone on a shell (106) and into contact with an 

image member (1) carrying an electrostatic image by rapidly rotating a 
magnetic core (104) within the shell (106). The core (104) has 

alternating magnetic poles around its periphery. To prevent carryout 
of carrier on the image member (1), an AC bias is impressed across the 

development zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the application of toner to an
electrostatic image to create a toner image. More specifically, this
invention relates to an improvement in the development of a
electrostatic image using a two component developer made up of
charged toner particles and oppositely charged hard magnetic carrier
particles.U.S. Patent No. 4,546,060, Miskinis et al issued October 8,
1985, discloses a method of developing electrostatic images using
developer including a "hard" magnetic carrier having a coercivity of at
least 300 gauss (1 gauss or oersted =  103 / 4Ï€ A/m) when magnetically saturated and exhibiting an induced
magnetic moment of at least 20 emu/gm of carrier when in a applied
field of 1000 gauss. A preferred embodiment of this carrier having
much higher coercivity, in the neighborhood of 2000 gauss, with a
higher magnetic moment, about 55 emu/gm, is commercially used to
provide the highest quality of electrostatic image development
presently available. In this method, developer made up of such hard
carrier particles and oppositely charged toner particles is moved at the
same speed and direction as the image by high speed rotation of a
magnetic core within a shell or sleeve on which the developer moves.
Rapid pole transitions on the shell are mechanically resisted by the
carrier because of its high coercivity. "Strings" or "chains" of the
carrier rapidly flip on the shell to move with the toner on the shell
through developing relation with the electrostatic image. See, also,
U.S. Patent No. 4,473,029, Fritz et al, and U.S. Patent No. 4,531,832,
Kroll et al.The rapid pole transitions, for example, as many as 400 per
second on the shell surface when at a core speed of 1500 rpm, create
great vigorousness in the developer as it moves through the
development zone. This vigorousness constantly recirculates the toner
to the shell surface and then back to the outside of the nap to provide it
with its desired charge for development. It also continually feeds fresh 
toner to the image. This system provides high density, high quality
images at high development speed.The direct interaction of the developer nap with the image
member causes the developer to roll back toward the input side of the
development zone. This rollback broadens the contact between the
developer and the image member and improves the development
completion of the system. However, it also has a tendency to separate
the carrier somewhat from the magnetic fields of the core with the
result that some carrier particles are picked up in

A method of reducing carrier carryout while toning an electrostatic
image on an image member (1), said method comprising:


supplying a two component developer to an applicator (102)
having a rotatable multipole magnetic cove (104) and a shell (106)

around at least a portion of the core, the two component developer
including charged toner particles and oppositely charged carrier

particles which carrier particles comprise a hard magnetic material
exhibiting a coercivity of at least 300 gauss when magnetically

saturated and an induced magnetic moment of at least 20 EMU/gm
of carrier when in an applied field of 1000 gauss,
rotating the core (104) to produce rapid pole transitions on the
shell characterized by the steps of:
moving the developer along the shell in a wave motion and
into direct contact with the image member (1) in a development

zone, and
creating an alternating current field between the shell and the
image member such that the carrier particles are maintained

substantially in the development zone.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the field has a direct
current component which encourages the deposition of toner in image areas but

discourages the deposition of toner in background areas.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the contact between the
two component developer and the image member is sufficient to create a

substantial rollback of developer contacting the image member (1).
The method according to claim 1 wherein the coercivity of the
carrier is greater than 1000 gauss.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the coercivity of the
carrier is greater than 1500 gauss.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the alternating current
field has a voltage in excess of 500 volts and a frequency in excess of 1000

Hertz.

core (104) and a shell (106) around at least a portion of the core
(104),
means (35) for rotating the magnetic core (104) to move

Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the shell and image member

the image member causes a substantial rollback of developer in contact with the
image member.
