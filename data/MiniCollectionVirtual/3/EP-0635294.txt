<ABSTRACT>
A process for separating components of a liquid mixture 
comprising a more adsorbable component (A), for example C₁ to C₆ 

carboxylic acids, and a less adsorbable component (B), for example 
water, wherein the relative adsorbity of component (A), component 

(B) and a desorbent liquid (D) with respect to an adsorbent in an 
adsorption column is in the order D
>
A
>
B, which process comprises the 
steps in sequence of: (a) passing the liquid mixture through an 

adsorption column containing the adsorbent and selectively adsorbing 
component (A) while discharging a stream enriched in component (B); 

(b) rinsing the adsorbent in the adsorption column after step (a) 
with desorbent liquid (D) which is immiscible with component (B) 

whereby component (A) is displaced from adsorbent by desorbent (D) 
and withdrawing from the adsorption column a first liquid phase 

stream comprising a mixture of component (A) and component (B) and 
withdrawing from the adsorption column a second liquid phase stream 

comprising a mixture of desorbent (D) and component (A); and (c) 
thermally displacing desorbent (D) from the adsorbent in the 

adsorption column after step (b). 
Preferably, the desorbent (D) forms an azeotrope with 
component (B). Suitable adsorbents are highly micro-porous 

activated carbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separation process and in 
particular to a process for separating components of a liquid 
mixture by selective adsorption utilising one or more adsorption 
columns. US patent 5026482 describes a process for separating a liquid 
feedstock comprising a more adsorbable component (A) and a less 
adsorbable component (B) wherein the relative adsorptivity of 
component (A), component (B) and a desorbent liquid (D) with respect 
to an adsorbent in an adsorption column is in the order D≧A>B in a 
system comprising a plurality of adsorption columns operated in 
cycle in a predetermined timed sequence, each adsorption column 
containing an adsorbent, which process comprises the following 
sequence of operational steps performed in the order recited in each 
of the adsorption columns in its turn: 
(a) passing the feedstock through the adsorption column and 
selectively adsorbing the more adsorbable component (A) while 
discharging a stream enriched in component (B); (b) rinsing the adsorption column in a direction co-current 
to the feedstock with the more adsorbable component (A) 
whereby the less adsorbable component (B) is displaced from 
the adsorption column and withdrawing a stream comprising a 
mixture of the more adsorbable component (A) and the less 
adsorbable component (B) from the adsorption column; (c) rinsing the adsorption column with a liquid desorbent 
(D) whereby the more adsorbable component (A) and the less  
 
adsorbable component (B) are displaced from the adsorbent bed 
and withdrawing a stream enriched in component (A) from the 
adsorption column; and (d) rinsing the adsorption column with component (B) whereby 
the desorbent liquid (D) is displaced from the adsorption 
column and withdrawing therefrom a stream comprising less 
adsorbable component (B) and desorbent liquid (D).  
Optionally, the process further comprises: 
(e) separating the stream of step (c) comprising the more 
adsorbable component (A) and the desorbent (D) and utilising a 
portion of the separated desorbent (D) as a source of 
desorbent (D) in step (c); and (f) separating the stream of step (d) comprising the less 
adsorbable component (B) and the desorbent liquid (D) and 
utilising a portion of the separated desorbent (D) as a source 
of desorbent (D) in step (c). An example according to US patent 5026482 wherein the order of 
adsorptivity with respect to the adsorbent is in the order D>A>B is 
said to be the separation of acetic acid and water wherein the more 
adsorbable component
