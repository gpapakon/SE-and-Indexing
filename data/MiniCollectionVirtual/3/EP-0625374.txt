<ABSTRACT>
The centrifuging machine comprises walls (10) inside the 
tub which are gently inclined from the bottom towards the 

top, opening outwards, enabling the separation of phases by 
means of the component of the centrifugal force which is 

applied to the inclined surface in the upward direction, 
with multiple grooves (12) which run from the lower part to the 

upper part thereof, the bottoms of said grooves being 
gently inclined outwards. The inner wall (10) of the tub is 

provided with a coating of synthetic materials to form a 
single lining (13) and the whole of the internal and external 

surfaces of the tub are provided with a coating (15,16) of 
synthetic resin which is resistant to chemical attack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
centrifuging machine which has characteristics of novelty 
and inventive step relative to what is currently known in 
the field. Centrifuging machines are designed carry out the 
separation of solid and liquid phases, in particular in 
chemical processes and the like, by using the centrifugal 
force, and they therefore comprise a tub in which the 
mixture or suspension to be separated is arranged and which 
is subjected to a rotational speed great enough to force 
certain phases to separate through a piece of material 
which lines the wall of the tub of the centrifuge. Said 
walls therefore normally have multiple holes through which 
the phases to be separated pass to be collected in a 
separate compartment before proceeding outside the machine. Among the problems which are traditionally encountered 
in the construction and use of centrifuging machines is to 
be specially mentioned the chemical attack of many of the 
products to be treated on the components of the centrifuge. The present invention has essentially new 
characteristics which enable the above mentioned problems 
to be solved in an efficient way. The essential 
characteristic of the present invention is based on the 
constitution of the tub walls such that the phases to be 
separated can leave without the need for said walls to have 
holes. The tub of the centrifuge which forms the object of 
the present invention therefore has an interior wall or  
 
walls which are provided with gently inclined grooves which 
open outwards from the bottom towards the top or from the 
top towards the bottom, such that the liquid projected 
against said walls by the centrifugal has a vector of force 
which is the component of the centrifugal force against the 
inclined wall, causing said liquid to ascend or descend 
along the walls of the tub until it is expelled in a region 
close to the edges or at the bottom thereof. In this way 
the need to provide perforations in the walls of the tub is 
avoided. At the same time the tub, like the other elements 
which come into contact with the liquids to be treated, is 
coated externally with a layer of synthetic material which 
prevents chemical attack by the products to be centrifuged. 
It should be noted that such a coating would be impossible 
in practice in the case of tubs provided with perforations. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention 
the tub of the centrifuge is provided with an interior 
lining or casing made of a material which is highly 
resis

<CLAIMS>
An improved centrifuging machine of the type which 
is provided with a tub that rotates about its central axis, 

partially open above, and which has means for receiving the 
products to be treated inside the tub and for enabling the 

desired fractions to be separated by centrifugal force, 
characterized in that the inner wall or walls of the tub 

are gently inclined from the bottom towards the top, 
opening outwards, enabling the separation of phases by 

means of the component of the centrifugal force which is 
applied to the inclined surface in the upward direction.

1, characterized in that inner wall of the tub is provided 

with multiple grooves which run from the lower part to the 
upper part thereof, the bottoms of said grooves being 

gently inclined outwards.

part of the tub to allow the fraction separated by 
centrifuging to proceed to the outside. 
An improved centrifuging machine according to the 
previous claims, characterized in that the whole of the 

internal and external surfaces of the tub are provided with 
a coating of synthetic resin which is resistant to chemical 

attack. 
An improved centrifuging machine according to claim 
1, characterized in that the interior walls of the tub 

 
comprise a fitted element of transversely corrugated 

plating forming ribs and grooves designed to evacuate the 
particles to be separated. 
An improved centrifuging machine according to claim

on the walls of the centrifuge chamber, said grooves 
starting at the upper edge and at the lower edge 

respectively of said chamber and being gently inclined 
towards a central part of the tub itself where there are a 

number of outlet holes for eliminating the liquid via said 
intermediate part. 
An improved centrifuging machine according to 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a number of bolts pass 

through both the lid of the centrifuge, which is completely 
coated by a resin resistant to chemical attack, as well as 

the lower ring for retaining the removable inner bag, the 
lower part of said bolts being threaded to receive a 

tensioning nut and the upper part being provided with 
transverse opposing grooves that define a narrowing, each 

suitable for receiving the complementary mouth of latches 
which rotate about axes that are fixed to the lid and 

parallel to said pins.
