<ABSTRACT>
The low-voltage circuit breaker contains a stationary contact (2) and a moving contact (3). Both contacts and an arc splitter plate stack (6) are arranged in an arc extinguishing chamber (5). An extension piece (14), which extends in the direction of the arc splitter plate stack (6) and is used to accommodate an arc base is fitted on the stationary contact (2). A section, which is constructed in the form of a plate, of a power supply lead to the stationary contact (2) is expanded in a U-shape. The two limbs of the U are bridged at their free ends by a yoke. A conductor piece is fitted to the yoke. This conductor piece is in the form of a plate, is formed by a contact tongue (13) of the stationary contact (2) and by an extension piece (14) fastened thereto, and is inclined in the direction of the arc splitter plate stack (6) with respect to that section of the power supply lead which is in the form of a plate. An insulating piece (15) is arranged in the arc extinguishing chamber (5). This insulating piece (15) is provided with an opening, screens that section of the power supply lead of the stationary contact (2) in the form of a plate from the arc extinguishing chamber (5), and the conductor piece, which is in the form of a plate, is guided through its opening. This circuit breaker is distinguished by a low level of contact errosion and a low level of wear of the arc extinguishing chamber (5) while having a high switching capacity. This is a result of the fact that extinguising gas which emerges from the insulating part under the influence of an arc flows in a guided manner in the direction of the arc splitter plate stack (6), and that the base of the switching arc which has its root on the stationary contact (2) is guided particularly quickly into the arc splitter plate stack by this gas flow and by the force of the magnetic field of the current which is to be disconnected.

Low-voltage switch having a stationary contact 
(2) and a moving contact (3) and having an arc 

extinguishing chamber (5) which accommodates the two 
contacts as well as an arc splitter stack (6), and in 

the case of which a section, which is constructed in 
the form of a plate, of a power supply lead of the 

stationary contact (2) is widened in a U-shape, the two 
limbs (11) of the U are bridged by a yoke (12) at their 

free ends, and a conductor element is fitted on the 
yoke (12), which conductor element is formed by a 

contact tongue (13) of the stationary contact (2) and 
by an elongation element (14) fastened thereto, is 

inclined in the direction of the arc splitter stack (6) 
with respect to the plate-shaped section of the power 

supply lead, interacts with an insulating part (15) 
which is made of a material which emits extinguishing 

gas under the influence of an arc, and shields the 
plate-shaped section of the power supply lead of the 

stationary contact (2) with respect to the arc 
extinguishing chamber (5), characterized in that the 

conductor element is constructed in the form of a 
plate, in that the elongation element (14) is extended 

in the direction of the arc splitter stack (6), in that 
the insulating part (15) is provided with an opening 

(16) which is of rectangular construction and has 
lateral boundary surfaces, through which opening the 

plate-shaped conductor element is guided in such a 
manner that the lateral boundary surfaces rest on 

narrow side surfaces of the contact tongue (13), and in 
that the insulating part (15) and the stationary 

contact (2) form on the extinguishing chamber side a 
groove-shaped depression in whose base a contact 

element (7) of the stationary contact (2), which 
contact element interacts with the moving contact (3) 

in the switched-on position of the switch, is arranged. 
Switch according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the depression is bounded laterally by two tabs  

 
(18) of the insulating part (15), which are extended in 

the direction of the arc splitter stack (5) and each 
have a first section (20) with a tab rear which is 

arranged parallel to the elongation element (14). 
Switch according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the tabs (18) each have a second section, which is 

connected to the first section (20), is extended 
parallel to the plate-shaped section of the power 

supply lead of the stationary contact (2) and in whose 
region the elongation element (14) is guided out of the 

insulating part (15).
