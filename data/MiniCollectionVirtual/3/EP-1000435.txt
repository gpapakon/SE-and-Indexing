<ABSTRACT>
A cathode ray tube has at least one electron gun (6, 11, 12, 14) with a cathode (6), a control grid (11) and a focusing unit (14), as well as a strip (9) of electroconductive material connected to the ground potential and applied on the cathode ray tube in a substantially parallel direction to the outer lining (8) of the tube. Means and measures are disclosed which largely eliminate the harmful effects of high-voltage flashovers. The invention is applied in monitors.
