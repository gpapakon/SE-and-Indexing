<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a spark suppressor circuit for protection of an
electrical switch which in series with a load is connected between a first supply voltage
terminal and a second supply voltage terminal, the load and the electrical switch being
interconnected at a switch terminal, the spark suppressor circuit comprising:
a first, a second and a third connection terminal connectable to the first supply
voltage terminal, the second supply voltage terminal and the switch terminal,
respectively,a triggerable electronic switch having a first main electrode connected to the
third connection terminal, having a second main electrode connected to the second connection
terminal, and having a gate electrode,trigger means for triggering the triggerable electronic switch, the trigger means
comprising current supply means coupled between the first connection terminal and the
gate electrode of the triggerable electronic switch. The invention further relates to an electrical thermal appliance compnsing
such a spark suppressor circuit.A spark suppressor circuit of this type is known from Japanese Patent
Application JP-A-60 119 121. Electrical thermal appliances, such as irons, coffee-makers and
cookers, use thermostats to control the temperature. In these thermostats a bimetal
operates an electrical switch to interrupt the current to the heating element. In thermal
appliances the trend is towards higher power heating elements. The higher power results
in a larger current, causing increased wear of the contacts of the electrical switch. The
increased wear reduces the lifetime of the thermostat, which may even become less than
the life expectancy of the thermal appliance. The wear is caused by sparking between
the contacts of the electrical switch at the instants of opening, closing and bouncing of
the electrical switch. A spark suppression circuit may be employed to prevent sparking
and to increase the lifetime of the electrical switch.From French Patent Application 2.626.115 a spark suppression circuit is known, in which the electrical switch is connected
in series with an inductive load at the switch terminal. The series connection of the
switch and the load is arranged between the first and the second supply voltage
terminal, which terminals are connected to an a.c. mains voltage. The first main 
electrode of the triggerable electronic switch is connected to the switch terminal via a
resistor. The trigger gate of the triggerable electronic switch is connected to the first
main electrode of the triggerable
