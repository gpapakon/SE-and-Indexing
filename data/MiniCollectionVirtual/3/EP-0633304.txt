<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a urea grease
composition suitable for application to such parts to be
grease-lubricated as CV joints (Constant Velocity Universal
joints) and ball joints in motor vehicles and bearings and
gears of machinery in the steel and other various industries.With the recent progress in machine technology, there
are growing desires for size reduction, weight reduction,
precision increase, life prolongation, etc. in machines.
Since the joints, bearings, gears, and other components of
rotating parts also are small-sized and operated under high-speed
and high load conditions, the atmospheres in which the
lubricating greases applied to such parts are used have been
becoming very severe.CVJs (CV joints) and steel-rolling machines are taken
as examples to explain the above in more detail.In the automobile industry, the number of vehicles
employing a CVJ has increased with the increase in the number
of FF (front engine front drive) automobiles. Not only FF
vehicles but also four wheel drive (4 WD) vehicles are
increasing in number recently, with which the amount of CVJs
for automotive use increased rapidly. In particular, because
of the trends toward power and performance increase in FF 
vehicles and toward size reduction and weight reduction in
CVJs and because operating condition of CVJs are becoming
more severe, the durability requirement for CVJs is becoming
more and more severe. For example, CVJs have come to be
disposed at increased angles and be operated at higher speeds
under higher loads due to the employment of turbo-equipped or
larger-sized engines and, hence, there are cases where the
temperature of CVJs rises rapidly during driving because of,
e.g., increased internal heat generation. Various kinds of
CVJs exist, which are properly used according to
applications. Since the lubricants to be applied to CVJs are
also required to cope with torque and speed increase, there
is a desire for a grease which not only has excellent
resistance to higher temperatures but also is excellent in
so-called heating-inhibitory effect, i.e., the effect of
diminishing the friction of sliding parts to minimize
temperature increase.The inhibition of temperature increase by the
diminution of friction is desired also from the standpoints
of improving the durability of joints and sealing boot
materials and retarding the deterioration of the lubricant
itself. An excessive temperature increase accelerates the
aging of the sealing boot material and the deterioration of
the lubricant, resulting in a
