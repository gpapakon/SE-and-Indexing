<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pipe section of reinforced concrete, in particular a jacking pipe section, the axial ends of which are designed as connection ends (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) for connecting to following pipe sections (2), and arranged on one end (1b) of a pipe section (1) is a steel sleeve (5) for overlapping the other end (2a) of a following pipe section (2), the steel sleeve (5) being secured with anchors (6) in the pipe wall (4) in the area of the overlap. In order to obtain a reliable encircling seal, provision is made for the sleeve (5) to be provided in the area of its end (5a) facing the pipe section (1) with a radially inner, encircling profile (10) which is integrally cast in the reinforced concrete of the pipe wall (4).

Tube section of reinforced steel concrete, in particular
a pre-pressed tube section, whereof the axial ends are

constructed as connection ends (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) for connection
to subsequent tube sections (2) and located at one end (1b) of

a tube section (1) is a steel cuff for engaging over the other
end (2a) of a subsequent tube section (2), whereby the steel cuff

(5) is fixed in the region of the overlap to stays (6) in the
tube wall (4), characterised in that in the region of its end

(5a) facing the tube section (1), the cuff (5) supports a
radially inner, peripheral profile (10), which is cast in the

steel concrete of the tube wall (4).
Tube section according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the profile (10) lies closer to the inner end (5a) of the cuff

(5) than the stays (6).
Tube section according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the inner profile (10) ends axially at the plane defined by

the front side of the inner end (5a) of the cuff (5).
Tube section according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the profile (10) is a radial, peripheral

web.
Tube section according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the profile is a I-profile.
Tube section according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the profile (10) is a T-profile.
Tube section according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the profile (10) is an angle profile, in

particular an L-profile.
Tube section according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the profile lies in a radial plane, to

which the tube axis is perpendicular.
