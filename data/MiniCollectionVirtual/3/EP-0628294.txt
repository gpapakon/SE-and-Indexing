<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a partial pelvic endoprosthesis to replace part of the pelvis in the region of the hip joint. In its minimal configuration it comprises a basic body (100) which has a spherical cap-shaped recess (101) for accommodation of an artificial acetabulum, and an attachment (102) in which at least one reception hole (103, 104) is formed. The longitudinal axis of this hole includes an angle in the range from 20@ to 30@ with the polar axis (105) of the recess (101). Moreover, the endoprosthesis comprises a first connection element (200) used to connect the basic body (100) to the iliac bone region (400) of the remaining pelvis. This connection is effected via a self-locking seat of a peg (201) of the first connection element (200) in the minimum of one reception hole (103, 104) in the attachment (102) of the basic body (100). Viewed dorsally to ventrally, the peg (201) is inclined at an angle in the range from 25@ to 45@ and medially to laterally it is inclined at an angle in the range from 0@ to 10@. The object of the proposal is an endoprosthesis which can be produced individually from a set of elements in which individual elements can be exchanged even during the operation and whose installation position can be adjusted even during implantation.

Partial pelvic endoprosthesis to replace a pelvis part in the region of the hip joint, 
having a main body (100), which has a dome-shaped recess (101) to receive an 

artificial hip joint acetabulum and an attachment (102), in which is formed at least 
one receiver bore (103, 104) and a first connection element (200) to produce a 

connection of the main body (100) with the ilium region (400) of the remaining 
pelvis, wherein the connection can be made via a self-locking seat of a journal (201) 

of the first connection element (200) in at least one receiver bore (103, 104) in the 
attachment (102) of the main body (100), wherein the longitudinal axis of at least one 

receiver bore (103, 104) encloses an angle β in the region of 20° 
<
 β 
<
 30°, 
preferably β = 25°, with the polar axis (105) of the recess (101), characterised in 

that the main body (100) and the attachment (102) form a constructional unit, and in 
that the journal (201), seen dorsally to ventrally, is inclined at an angle γ in the 

region 25° 
<
 γ 
<
 45°, preferably γ = 35°, and medially to laterally at an angle δ = 
5°. 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to claim 1, in which two receiver bores 
(103, 104), the longitudinal axes of which enclose an angle α in the region of 40° 
<
 
α 
<
 60°, preferably α = 50°, with one another, and in each case the angle β in the 
region of 20° 
<
 β 
<
 30°, preferably β = 25°, with the polar axis (105) of the recess 
(107), are formed in the attachment (102). 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to claim 2, in which using a second 
connection element (300) to produce a connection for the main body (100) with the 

pubic bone region (410) of the remaining pelvis, a connection can be made via a self-locking 
seat of a journal-like connecting element (301) in the other receiver bore 

(103, 104) in the attachment (102) of the main body (100). 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to claim 2 or 3, in which the two receiver 
bores (103, 104) have the same size and the same shape, and the outer contours of  

 
the journal-like connecting element (301) of the second outer element (300) 

correspond to those of the journal (201) of the first connection element (200). 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to one of claims 2 to 4, in which the 
receiver bores (103, 104) are designed as conical split taper sockets, and the journal 

(201) and the journal-like connecting element (301) as conical plug journals. 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which the 
receiver bores (103, 104) in the attachment (102) extend to the inner dome of the 

main body (100), so that they are also accessible from the inner side of the main 
body. 
Partial pelvic endoprosthesis according to one of claims 1 to 6, in which the first 
connection element (200) has a base (202) for resting against the ilium region (400),

bracket (205), between which the remaining bone rests, and in which a stem part
