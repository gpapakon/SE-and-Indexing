<ABSTRACT>
Data collection devices often have optical transmitters to transfer the stored data. In most cases, read devices cannot be coupled directly to the transmitter during the recording of these data, so that extraneous light impairs the data transfer. The evaluation method and the circuit arrangement to carry out the method are intended to enable signal recording which is largely independent of the effects of interference. For this purpose, the useful signal, with a superimposed noise signal, is first amplified and a derivative signal containing the pulse edges of the useful signal is formed through differentiation and these pulse edges are then separated in a comparator stage (9) according to their polarity and an output signal corresponding to the useful signal is finally generated by means of a downstream memory component (15). The circuit arrangement to carry out the method is particularly suitable for high-speed recording of counter readings with a mobile data recording apparatus.
