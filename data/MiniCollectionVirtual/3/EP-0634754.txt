<ABSTRACT>
A process for destroying alkali metal and alkaline 
earth metal-containing wastes, such as sodium, by feeding 

such waste into a molten bath containing a molten salt such 
as sodium carbonate, or a mixture of salts having a lower 

melting point, such as a mixture of sodium carbonate and an 
alkali metal halide, e.g. sodium chloride, or mixtures of 

alkali metal chlorides, feeding a mixture of carbon dioxide 
and oxygen into the molten salt bath and reacting the alkali 

metal or alkaline earth metal such as sodium in the waste 
with the carbon dioxide and oxygen to form alkali metal 

carbonate, e.g. sodium carbonate, in the molten salt bath.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the destruction of 
alkali metal and alkaline earth metal waste. It 
particularly relates to a molten salt process for destroying 
alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and 
mixtures thereof, present in liquid metal reactor coolants. Alkali and alkaline earth metal waste e.g. 
radioactive sodium waste from reactor heat transfer media, 
are hazardous wastes because of the characteristic of 
reactivity. Before they can be disposed of, this 
characteristic must be destroyed. A large inventory of such 
metals, particularly sodium, potassium, lithium and mixtures 
of these metals are also radioactive. A number of processes for the disposal of these 
metals such as sodium exists. These include reaction of 
sodium with water, reaction of sodium with concentrated  
 
caustic, reaction with alcohol, burning of sodium in oxygen, 
calcination with silica, and reactions of sodium with 
ammonia, hydrogen, halogens and nitrous oxide. However, 
these present methods for the destruction of the 
characteristic of reactivity of alkali metals such as sodium 
have been proven generally unsatisfactory and 
disadvantageous for various reasons, such as the production 
of hydrogen, an explosive gas, or oxides, which are highly 
corrosive. Thus, the provision of a suitable method and the 
design of facilities to process large quantities of alkali 
and alkaline earth metal waste, such as sodium, is very 
challenging. According to the present invention, alkali and 
alkaline earth metals such as sodium, are reacted with a 
mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen (or air) in a molten 
salt bath, e.g. molten alkali carbonate such as sodium 
carbonate. The alkali carbonate, e.g. sodium carbonate 
salt, resulting from the oxidation reaction is not hazardous 
and merely adds to the volume of salt in the bath. If the 
feed metal such as sodium is radioactive, most of the 
radioactivity remains in the molten salt bed. When operated 
as either a batch or continuous process, there are no  
 
reactive off-gas products. The reaction rate and operating 
temperature are readily controllable and there is 
essentially no release of radioactive materials from the 
salt bath. The salt composition of the molten salt bath can 
be tailored to lower the melting point of the salt. For 
example, if sodium is converted to sodium carbonate by 
reaction with oxygen and carbon dioxide, the melting point 
of the salt will be about 855°C. The reaction can be 
carried out at much lower temperatures, e.g. within the 
limits
