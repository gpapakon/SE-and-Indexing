<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a safety monitoring system, for protecting devices having normal or enhanced safety for machines (target system) carrying out rotary movements, one dynamic signal (proportional to the rotation speed) and one static signal (0/1) are in each case evaluated for each shaft circuit in order to identify whether the shaft is rotating or is stationary, the contactor-controlled drive current path being enabled only when both signals simultaneously signal that the machine is at rest, in conjunction with the protection device (19) (guard cover, door and the like) being closed. In this case, the static stationary identification signal (L) can be obtained from hardware circuitry in the switching-on contactor current path, as contact-making and, after the target system has been turned off, the static signal content can be stored, in the sense of a turn-off delay for a predetermined time period, or the static stationary identification signal (L) is obtained from an additional rotation speed detection means, by means of proximity switches, in the form of a dynamic signal and is supplied inside the equipment to a frequency-dependent switch.
