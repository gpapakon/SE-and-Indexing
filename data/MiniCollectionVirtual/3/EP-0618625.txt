<ABSTRACT>
A process is described of producing devices, such as vertical cavity 
surface emitting lasen or resonant cavity light emitting devices, with an insulating 

region between an active region and top electrode, the insulating region having a 
centrally located window permitting passage of the electric current from the top 

electrode to the bottom electrode centrally of the active region. The insulating 
region is formed by ion implantation. The window is defined by a photoresist mask 

formed by angle etching a photoresist masking layer by RIE, so as to form the mask 
with parallel side walls inclined at an angle to the normal to the masked surface. The 

ion implantation is conducted at the same angle and parallel to the side walls of the 
of the mask. This permits fabrication of devices individually or in arrays. An 

exemplary independently addressable top emitting 8×18 VCSEL array (VCSELA) 
with GaAs multi-quantum well gain region was fabricated with excellent properties 

using the angle etched masks. The typical threshold current and voltage of the 
exemplary devices in this array are approximately 4 mA and 2.65V respectively. 

The L-I-V characteristics of the devices do not change by current annealing. Also, a 
comparison between devices produced by using the novel angled implantation mask 

and devices produced by using conventional lithography implantation mask indicates 
the importance of the implantation mask preparation on the final VCSEL operating 

characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns manufacture of electronic devices having an 
internal window and the so-produced devices. Two dimensional arrays of such electronic devices as Vertical Cavity 
Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) or Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), have 
numerous applications in high capacity switching systems, back-plane computer 
interconnect technology, smart pixel arrays, high power coherent beam generation, 
and two dimensional beam steering. The elements of these arrays can either work in 
unison to generate coherent supermodes or operate independently as high density 
sources for multi-channel systems. In the manufacture of such electronic devices, an 
area of semiconductor layers, such as distributed Bragg reflector mirror and/or 
confining layer, above an active (radiation emitting) region is peripherally implanted 
with dopant (proton) ions while leaving the central area of those layers unaffected. 
These peripheral areas become impenetrable to electric current restricting its passage 
to the central area of the active region. In this manner the electric current flow from 
a top electrode to a bottom electrode of the device is directed through the central area 
of the active layer defined by the so-formed window, while the optical radiation is 
emitted through the window and then through the aperture in the top electrode. 
Examples of VCSELs are disclosed in articles by G.Hasnain et al., "High 
Temperature and High Frequency Performance of Gain-Guided Surface Emitting 
Lasers, ElectronicsLetters Vol. 27, No. 11, May 23, 1991, pp. 915-16, and G. 
Hasnain et al., "Performance of Gain-Guided Surface Emitting Lasers with 
Semiconductor Distributed Bragg Reflectors", IEEEJournalofQuantumElectronics, 
Vol. 27, No.6, June 1991, pp. 1377-85. Applicants have discovered that conventional photoresist processing of 
masks for ion implantation and subsequent implantation of proton ions through the 
masks leads to improperly defined windows, wherein the walls of the windows have 
unsharply defined, fuzzy implantation damage outlines resulting in higher device 
resistance. This leads to higher threshold values of the device, which leads to lower 
operating characteristics of the device. Thus, it is desirable to produce implantation 
damage profile which more precisely defines the window in the ion-damaged area.  This invention embodies a process of producing devices, such as vertical 
cavity surface emitting lasers or resonant cavity light emitting devices, with an 
insulating region between an active
