<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to aqueous machining fluid compositions 
employed in the shaping and working of metal and solid non-metal 
workpieces and such processes using machining fluid compositions. 
Further this invention pertains to aqueous machining fluids having 
sulfur containing components to achieve improved machining performance. Oil (i.e. non-aqueous) based fluids have long been known in the 
art for use in metalworking process (i.e. processes for mechanically 
shaping and working metals). Such fluids have exhibited good 
lubricating and cooling functions which reduce friction and dissipate 
heat in a metalworking process, This reduction of friction and 
dissipation of heat promotes long tool life, increases production and 
allows the attainment of high quality finished metal products. Many of 
the oil based metalworking fluids contain sulfurized oils to achieve 
effective friction reduction in the metalworking process. These 
sulfurized oils often have a high sulfur content and cause odor problems 
in metalworking operations, especially when sufficient heat is generated 
in the metalworking process. Notwithstanding the effectiveness of many 
oil based metalworking fluids such fluids exhibit, in addition to odor 
problems, disposal problems, health problems from vapors, safety 
problems, material availability problems and costs which have lead to 
the increased demand for and use of aqueous based metalworking fluids. 
Aqueous based metalworking fluids have been found to have fewer 
disposal, health, safety and availability problems than oil based metal-working 
fluids. Aqueous based metalworking fluids have low fire hazard, 
often easier disposal and many times lower cost characteristics compared 
to oil based metalworking fluids. In spite of these advantages aqueous 
based metalworking fluids have often exhibited lower performance (e.g. 
lower friction reduction) than oil based metalworking fluids. This 
lower performance has resulted often in a reduction in productivity and 
tool life. In metal grinding operations such lower performance is shown  
 
in greater wheel wear, lower G-ratios, increased frequency of wheel 
dressing, lower output and poorer finish on the parts. Metalworking operations mechanically shape and work metallic 
workpieces by cutting and non-cutting processes. The cutting processes 
include, for example, drilling, grinding, milling, tapping, turning and 
broaching. Non-cutting processes include, for example, rolling, 
drawing, extrusion, drawing and ironing, punching,
