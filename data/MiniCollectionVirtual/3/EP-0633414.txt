<ABSTRACT>
A valve comprising a flow passage having first and 
second valve elements (A, B), the first valve element 

(A) being engageable with the second valve element (B) 
during opening displacement of the first valve element 

(A), thereby to displace the second valve element (B) 
to an open position. The use of two valve elements (A, 

B) provides improved sealing over an extended period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to valves. Conventional gas valves which are used in industry 
or in more general applications are designed with 
practical, economical and safety considerations in 
mind, rather than durability considerations, which are 
of no less importance. Research by both domestic and overseas researchers 
has found that conventional gas valves can be seriously 
affected by environmental factors. The prime function 
of a valve is the safe channelling of gas. As valves 
operate they are often subjected to dusty conditions. 
Eventually the valves are unable to close properly due 
to dust accumulation and they begin to leak. A gas leak caused by the accumulations of dust 
between the valve seal and the valve seat inevitability 
causes complaints from the user of the valve and will 
eventually result in the valves getting a bad 
reputation for reliability. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a valve comprising a flow passage having first 
and second valve elements, the first valve element 
being engageable with the second valve element during 
opening displacement of the first valve element, 
thereby to displace the second valve element to an open 
position. In a valve using two valve elements, if one of the 
valve elements should fail to work, the second valve 
element will compensate. If the valve elements act 
independently when closing the valve and stopping the 
flow of gas, the sealing action of the valve is greatly 
improved. Although valves with two valve elements are 
relatively expensive, the advantage of prevention of 
gas leakage is obviously extremely important. Thus a 
valve made according to the present invention will  
 
rapidly gain customer confidence, since such valves are 
more durable. The valves may be made of brass and are preferably 
made by a forging process. A safety/over pressure 
device may be incorporated into the valves. For a better understanding of the present 
invention and to show more clearly how it may be 
carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way 
of example, to the accompanying drawing, which is a 
longitudinal cross-sectional view of a gas valve. The top of the gas valve (D) is adapted to fit a 
conventional regulator, commonly used by the gas 
industry, so that the gas valve according to the 
present invention can be used with existing equipment. When a conventional regulator is installed on the 
gas valve and the gas is switched on, upper valve 
element (A) is pushed downwards and upper valve seal 
(02) is separated

<CLAIMS>
A valve comprising a flow passage having 
first and second valve elements, the first valve 

element being engageable with the second valve element 
during opening displacement of the first valve element, 

thereby to displace the second valve element to an open 
position. 
A valve as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
first and second valve elements close independently. 
A valve as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which 
the first and second valve elements are of different 

sizes. 
A valve as claimed in claim 3, in which the 
second valve element is larger than the first element. 
A valve as claimed in claim 4, in which a 
given axial displacement of the first and second valve 

elements from respective valve seats results in a 
larger cross-sectional area for flow past the second 

valve element compared to that past the first valve 
element. 
A method for flowing gas from a container to 
regulator comprising the installation of regulator such 

that the regulator axis pushes upper spindle and 
provides an opening between upper spindle rubber and 

valve body, and the lower spindle, by being pushed 
downward by the upper spindle, provides an opening 

between the lower spindle rubber and valve body, and 
the gas from the container flows to the regulator 

through the lower spindle opening and the upper spindle 
opening to the regulator, and that if the regulator is 

removed, because the upper spindle spring force shuts 
the opening between the upper spindle rubber and the 

valve body, and the lower spindle shuts the opening 
between the lower spindle rubber and the valve body 

resulting in the gas in the container being held by the 
lower spindle and the upper spindle. 
A gas valve device for flowing or holding gas 
in accordance with claim 6 comprising head of valve, 

upper spindle unit, lower spindle unit and safety 
valve, characterised by the valve being in closed 

condition with each of the two spindle units working 
individually. 
The upper and or the lower spindle unit in 
accordance with claim 7 comprising the spindle equipped 

with spindle rubber and spring for pushing the spindle 
upward. 
The upper spindle and the lower spindle in 

accordance with claims 7 and 8, which form openings for 
gas flow when the upper spindle was pushed by the 

regulator installation. 
The upper opening and the lower opening in 
accordance with claim 9 having predetermined profile 

width.
