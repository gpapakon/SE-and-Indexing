<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to novel membranes comprising 60-100 %, based on their total weights, of acrylonitrile copolymer A) and 40-0 %, based on their total weights, of a polymer B) which is compatible with A). The copolymer A) comprises 70-95 % of acrylonitrile, 0-1 % of methallylsulphonic acid or alkali metal salts thereof and 5-30 % of a comonomer of the group consisting of nonionic vinyl- and (meth)acrylic acid derivative. A) has a mean molecular weight, determined as the number average Mn, of 30-150 kg/mol, a content of strong acids of 2-100 meq/kg and a content of total acid of 10-160 meq/kg. B) represents one or more water-soluble or water-insoluble polymers which are compatible with A).
