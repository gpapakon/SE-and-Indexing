<ABSTRACT>
A lens (10) is disclosed for use on automotive vehicles and which forms part of lamp assemblies used on the rear, front or side surfaces thereof. The lens utilizes a combination of optical elements (25) and reflex elements (24) interspersed therewith, the density of the reflex elements (24) relative to the optic elements (25) being graduated in selected areas of the lens surface, for example from the stop or brake light area (12) of the lens through the "running light" area (14) to a fog area (16). One form of the invention has the optic elements (25) and the reflex elements (24) on a single lens surface and, in another embodiment, the optic elements (25) of the lens (10) are located on one lens surface (52) and the reflex elements (24) are located in juxtaposition outwardly thereof on a second lens surface (48) and spaced from one another so that the reflex elements (24) are axially interspersed between the optic elements (25). The method of manufacturing both forms of lenses is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lens and the method 
of making it and in particular to a lens for use on 
lamp assemblies of an automotive vehicle, for example 
a rear lamp assembly, and comprises a combination of 
optic elements and reflex elements. Conventionally, the outer lens portion of 
automobile lamp assemblies whether used on the rear, 
front or side surfaces thereof, have been divided into 
two or more distinct sections. At least one of these 
sections includes optical elements which transmit 
light from a light source in the assembly outwardly 
thereof, as is the case in the "taillight" sections or 
"brake light" sections, and another section made up of 
reflex elements the purpose of which is to reflect 
light from an exterior light source directed at the 
lamp assembly. As an example, optical elements of the 
lens are located outwardly of a light source in the 
body of the assembly. The optical elements, or optics 
as they are sometimes referred to, direct and transmit 
a first light source, for example a taillight bulb, 
and they also serve to direct and transmit the 
stronger light resulting from a brake application, or 
a directional signal in the case of a front or side 
located assembly, resulting from a higher intensity 
bulb being brought into play with a brake application 
or directional signal actuation. The reflex 
portion of the assembly consists of an arrangement of  
 
a plurality of multi-faceted elements that provide a 
reflective brilliance to a light source directed at 
the assembly from the exterior thereof, for example, 
from the head lights of another automobile being 
directed at a rear lamp assembly incorporating the 
reflex elements in question. The brilliance of the 
reflective elements must meet standards set by various 
countries. Examples of the prior art may be found in 
German Offenlegungsschrift 2 230 584, 28 December 
1972, 
U.S. Patent 3,632,695 of January 4, 1972; and 
U.S. Patent 4,198,182 of April 15, 1980. DE-A-2 230 584 illustrates a plane of optical 
elements parallel with a plane of reflex elements. U.S. Patent 3,632,695 discloses a method of 
making a combined lens and reflector in which a 
plurality of pins having shaped ends are assembled in 
a bundle and replacing portions of the shaped ends 
where optical elements are to be formed. A mold is 
electroformed over the shaped ends and subsequently 
the electroform mold is shaped at the areas of the 
optical elements to form the desired optical surfaces. U.S. Patent 4,198,182, there is disclosed a lamp
