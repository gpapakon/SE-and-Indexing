<ABSTRACT>
The existence of an unacceptable vapour leak can be determined by 
monitoring the pressure within a fuel system of an internal combustion 

engine. Once the engine is switched off, a period (T1) is timed to allow 
pressure variations due to movement of the fuel to subside to an 

acceptable level. The fuel system is closed and a first rate of pressure 
increase is determined by measuring a first time (T2) taken for the 

pressure to rise by a predetermined amount (Pt). A leak of a 
predetermined size is then introduced and a second rate of pressure 

increase is determined by measuring a second time (T3) taken for the 
pressure to rise by a predetermined amount (Pt). The first and second 

times are then compared to detect whether or not an unacceptable leak 
exists.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for detecting 
a fuel system leak. In order to reduce hydrocarbon emissions from fuel systems of vehicles 
fitted with internal combustion engines, it is known to vent the system 
through a canister containing charcoal for removing the hydrocarbons 
before they can be released to the atmosphere. However, should an 
unacceptable leak occur between the canister and the remainder of the 
fuel system, fuel vapour can leak to the atmosphere, thus releasing 
hydrocarbons. Forthcoming legislation requires that any such leak 
should be no greater than approximately 1 mm² and it is necessary to 
test fuel systems so as to detect an unacceptably large vapour leak from 
the fuel system. This test should be applied by the vehicle engine 
management system. Various proposals have been made for testing fuel systems for 
unacceptable leaks. Such techniques rely on pressurising or 
depressurising the fuel system to assess the size of any leak. However, 
such techniques are performed while the engine is running and the 
vehicle is moving. Movement of the vehicle causes movement or 
sloshing of fuel in a fuel tank and this gives rise to problems in 
accurately assessing the degree of vapour leakage by causing 
unpredictable variations in pressure.  According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method 
of detecting an unacceptable vapour leak in a fuel system of a vehicle 
internal combustion engine, comprising performing a pressure test while 
the engine is switched off, the pressure test comprising closing the fuel 
system and measuring a first rate of pressure rise in the fuel system, 
introducing a predetermined vapour leak into the fuel system and 
measuring a second rate of pressure rise in the fuel system, and 
comparing the first and second rates of pressure rise to detect the 
presence of an unacceptable vapour leak. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an 
apparatus for detecting an unacceptable vapour leak in a fuel system of a 
vehicle internal combustion engine, comprising:
 
detecting means for detecting when the engine is switched off;
 
pressure measuring means for measuring pressure in the fuel system;
 
closing means for closing the fuel system;
 
introducing means for introducing a predetermined vapour leak into the 
fuel system;
 
first means responsive to the detecting means and the pressure measuring 
means for determining a first rate of pressure rise in the fuel system when 
the closing means
