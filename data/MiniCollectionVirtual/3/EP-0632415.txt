<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transaction apparatus of the kind suitable for processing
documents such as, for example, cheques and bills for payment.The processing by financial institutions, such as banks, of financial documents such as
cheques to be deposited and bills to be paid is a costly and time consuming operation, and can
often involve a customer wishing to perform a financial transaction, such as depositing a
cheque or paying a bill, in a long waiting time to receive the attention of a bank teller to
perform the transaction. Various suggestions have been made to automate these functions.For example, UK Patent Application No. 2 238 415 discloses a financial self-service
terminal which can accept cheques or other documents for effecting financial transactions.
Data is printed on the document, and an image of the printed document is captured and
displayed to the user for approval. At the end of the transaction, a transaction printer prints a
ticket providing a record of the transaction. However, after the transaction has been
completed, the customer may lack confidence that the document has been correctly identified
and processed. US-A- 4743 743 discloses a transaction terminal where in a deposit mode, the
user selects whether funds are to be transferred to another account or to his own account prior
to depositing a cheque or bill. If funds are to be transferred to another account, the user is
requested to enter the account details of the payee via the keyboard. After the input of this
information has been received, processing of the deposited cheque or bill is carried out and a
receipt for the transaction bearing information read from the cheque or bill is is issued to the
user. DE-A-2312984 discloses a transaction terminal which provides a receipt on which the
customer's signature and possibly other data which is read from the customers ID card may be
printed, while US-A-2930296 discloses a deposit terminal where a receipt bearing a
photographic image of the article deposited is issued to the customer.It is an object of the present invention to provide a transaction apparatus for
processing documents wherein the user of the apparatus can have greater confidence that a
document has been correctly identified and processed.Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a transaction apparatus
comprising document input means adapted to receive a transaction document to be processed;
card reader means for reading user identification data from a user presented card; image lift
means for
