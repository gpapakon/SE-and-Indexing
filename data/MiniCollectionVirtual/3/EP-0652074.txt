<ABSTRACT>
A machining head (5) presenting a hollow body (6) 
in turn presenting a first crosspiece (11) with a seat 

(14) for supporting in sliding manner a motor-driven 
tool spindle (16). The body (6) also presents a second 

crosspiece (44) fitted with means (38, 41) for axially 
displacing the spindle (16) which may be of different 

lengths and is driven by an electric motor (55) via a 
screw-nut screw pair (38, 37) located between the second 

crosspiece (44) and a third crosspiece (34) connected 
removably to the spindle (16). The second crosspiece 

(44) presents an end portion (81) pivoting by means of a 
pin (82) on an appendix (83) of the hollow body (6), and 

is fitted to the body by means of a pair of locating 
pins (91) and a pair of screws (94). By disconnecting 

the third crosspiece (34) from the spindle (16) and 
rotating the second crosspiece about the pin (82), the 

spindle (16) may be changed without removing the 
machining head (5) from the machine. The locating pins 

(91) are removed from their respective seats (88, 89) by 
means of a key (97) in the form of a screw and normally 

housed in a seat (96) on the crosspiece (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machining head 
for mechanically machining boards, in particular printed 
circuit boards. Such machining may include milling, e.g. for 
edging the boards, and drilling, e.g. in points arranged 
according to a given grid pattern, which operations may 
both be performed on the same machine using two 
different tools: a cutter and drill respectively. As 
each tool requires a different spindle, however, in 
terms of power, speed, etc., machines are normally 
designed to fit two sets of machining heads, one each 
for drilling and milling, which obviously makes for 
greater expense. 
An example of such a head is discribed in patent application 
WO-A-8 706 167. Known machining heads must be removed from the 
machine for repair or replacing worn parts, particularly 
the tool spindle, which is a complex operation requiring 
skilled personnel and therefore involving a good deal of 
time and expense. It is an object of the present invention to  
 
provide a machining head of the aforementioned type, 
which provides for troublefree removal, part replacement 
and assembly, is extremely low-cost, and provides for 
overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks typically 
associated with known machining heads. A machine head according to the present invention is 
provided with features as claimed in the 
characterising part of claim 1. According to a further characteristic of the 
invention, the length of said motor-driven spindle may 
vary; a third crosspiece being fitted to the spindle via 
removable spacer means of a length corresponding to that 
of the spindle, thus enabling different types of 
spindles to be fitted to the machining head. A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a partially-sectioned front view of 
a machining head for mechanically machining boards in  
 
accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 shows a partially-sectioned side view of 
the Figure 1 head; Figure 3 shows a front view of part of the head; Figure 4 shows a section along line IV-IV in 
Figure 3; Figure 5 shows a section along line V-V in Figure 
3; Figure 6 shows a mid section of a detail on the 
head. Number 5 in figure 1 indicates a machining head 
for mechanically machining, i.e. drilling or milling, 
printed circuit boards, and comprising an aluminium 
alloy body 6 with a substantially C-shaped horizontal 
section including a bottom wall 7 (Figures 3 and 4) and 
two
