<ABSTRACT>
A seal retention and anti-rotation locking assembly (20) is positioned within an aircraft wheel hub (10). The wheel hub (10) has a groove (26) disposed about the periphery of a central opening (12), the groove (26) receiving therein a complementary shaped single retaining ring (32). The retaining ring (32) is a split ring having first (33) and second (37) ends located adjacent one another. The first end (33) has a first increased axial width portion (34) with a recess (35) located therein and extending at an acute angle relative to a radius of the central opening (12). The second end (37) has a second increased axial width portion (38) located radially inwardly from the outer diameter (45) of the retaining ring (32) such that the second increased axial width portion (38) is located exteriorly of the groove (26). The groove (26) includes an enlarged axial portion (28) shaped complementary with and receiving the first increased axial width portion (34) to anchor circumferentially the retaining ring. A grease seal (40) extends between the periphery of the opening (12) and an axle member (14), and is secured circumferentially by an anchoring mechanism (50) which is coupled with a reinforcing member (22) of the grease seal (40). The anchoring mechanism extends axially and is received within the recess (35) of the first end (33) of the retaining ring (32), and thereby anchors circumferentially the grease seal (40) relative to the wheel hub (10) and central opening (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEAL RETENTION AND ANTI-ROTATION LOCKING ASSEMBLYThe present invention relates generally to a seal retention assembly for a wheel, and in particular to a grease seal retention and anti-rotation locking assembly.Aircraft wheels are typically mounted by means of roller bearings upon an aircraft axle. The roller bearings are lubricated with grease, and in order to retain the grease at the bearings, an annular seal extends radially inwardly between the periphery of the wheel hub opening and a stationary axle member. Prior constructions have suffered from the problem of an _ annular snap ring, which is utilized to hold the seal axially in place, bending or coning axially outwardly due to dynamic forces and permitting the grease seal to disengage and rotate in the wheel housing. Zvonar U. S. Patent No. 4,763,905 discloses a seal retention and anti-rotation locking assembly which can effectively prevent rotation of the assembly. It is highly desirable to provide a simplified seal retention and anti-locking assembly which anchors the grease seal by means of a single member that, when coupled with the wheel, does not create any stress concentrations within the wheel. It is desirable that the entire assembly require as few parts as possible, be easily assembled and disassembled from the wheel, and reduce the cost of the assembly.The present invention provides solutions to these problems by providing a seal retention and anti-rotation locking assembly in combination with a wheel, comprising a wheel hub of the wheel having a wheel opening, a groove disposed about the periphery of the opening and including an enlarged axial portion, a single retaining ring disposed within the groove and including reception means at an end thereof and the end having an increased axial width portion along a predetermined length thereof, the increased axial width portion received in the groove and the enlarged axial portion, sealing means disposed within the opening and extending radially between the periphery of said opening and a non-rotating axle member, the sealing means having a reinforcing member which includes receiving means, and anchoring means received fixedly within the receiving means and extending axially to the 

reception means of the retaining ring, so that the enlarged axial portion of the groove anchors circumferentially the retaining ring which, by means of the reception means and anchoring means, anchors circumferentially the sealing means. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail with reference

SEAL RETENTION AND ANTI-ROTATION LOCKING ASSEMBLY
CLAIMS
1. A seal retention and anti-rotation locking assembly in combination with a wheel, comprising a wheel hub (10) of the wheel having a wheel opening (12) , a groove
(26) disposed about the periphery of the opening (12) and including an enlarged axial portion (28) , a single retaining ring (32) disposed within the groove (26) and including reception means (35) at an end (33) thereof and the end (33) having an increased axial width portion (34) along a predetermined length thereof, the increased axial width portion (34) received in the groove (26) and enlarged axial portion (28) , sealing means (40) disposed within the opening (12) and extending radially between the periphery of said opening (12) and a non-rotating axle member (14) , the sealing means (40) having a reinforcing member (22) which includes receiving means (24) , and anchoring means (50) received fixedly within the receiving means (24) and extending axially to the reception means (35) of the retaining ring, so that the enlarged axial portion (28) of the groove (26) anchors circumferentially the retaining ring (32) which, by means of the reception means (35) and anchoring means (50) , anchors circumferentially the sealing means (40) .
2. The assembly in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the reception means (35) comprises a recess (35) disposed within said end (33) , the recess (50) extending at an angle relative to a radius (R) of said wheel opening (12) , the anchoring means (50) being received and captured within said recess (35) .
3. The assembly in accordance with Claim 2, wherein one side of the recess (35) is defined by a finger
(36) of the increased axial width portion (34) and which extends at an acute angle relative to said radius (R) . . The assembly in accordance with Claim 3, wherein the anchoring means (50) comprises a threaded screw member (50) . 


 5. The assembly in accordance with Claim 1, wherein a radially outer peripheral portion (45) of the retaining ring (32) comprises a substantially thinner portion (45) of the ring (32) which is received within the groove (26) .
6. The assembly in accordance with Claim 5, wherein an opposite end (37) of the retaining ring (32) includes adjacent thereto a thin neck portion (39) permitting flexibility of the opposite end (37) of the retaining ring (32) .
