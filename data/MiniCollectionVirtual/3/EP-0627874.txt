<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making through-hole connections in printed circuit boards which are coated on both sides, by means of silver conductive paste and using a printing screen which has openings associated with the through-plated holes in the printed circuit board. In the case of the process, the printing screen (5), which is provided with a silver conductive paste layer (7), is placed on the printed circuit board (1), and the underneath of the printed circuit board is subjected to a reduced atmospheric pressure (p), as a result of which the silver conductive paste (7) forms hollow-cylindrical electrical conductors which rest against the walls of the through-plated holes (2).

Method of producing through-contacts in printed circuit boards in which 
a conductive paste (7) is introduced into the holes (2) provided in a 

printed circuit board (1) for the through-contacts with the aid of a 
printing screen (5), said conductive paste (7) interconnecting the 

conductive tracks on the two sides of the printed circuit board (1) in an 
electrically conductive manner, wherein a conductive paste (7) is applied 

to the printing screen (5) which comprises openings (6) that are associated 
with the holes (2) for the through-contacts and the soldering points (3, 4) 

of the printed circuit board (1) surrounding them, wherein the printing 
screen (5) and the printed circuit board (1) are brought together, wherein 

the lower side of the printed circuit board (1) is subjected to a low 
pressure (p), the intensity and duration of which are regulated such that 

the conductive paste (7) forms hollow, cylindrical, electrically conductive 
paths (7') on the walls of the holes (2) for the through-contacts, said 

conductive paths (7') encompassing the inner edges of the soldering points 
(3, 4) in flange-like manner, and wherein the conductive paste (7) is 

stripped from the printing screen with a squeegee means before the printing 
screen (5) is lifted away from the printed circuit board (1) and the 

diameters of the upper flanges of the electrically conductive paths (7') 
are determined by the diameters of the openings (6) associated with the 

holes for the through-contacts, characterised in that solder pads are 
provided as the soldering points (3, 4), that a conductive silver paste is 

used as the conductive paste (7), that a layer of conductive silver paste 
(7) of uniform thickness is coated onto the printing screen (5) which is 

disposed at a predetermined distance above the printed circuit board (1) 
and that thereafter, the printing screen (5) together with its layer of 

conductive silver paste is placed in contact with the printed circuit board 
(1) by lowering it so that it lies thereupon and that the lower side of the 

printed circuit board (1) is then subjected to the low pressure (p).
