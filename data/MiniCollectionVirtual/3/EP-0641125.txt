<ABSTRACT>
When an audio signal is reproduced from a video tape (1) on which audio signals having two kinds of effective 
samples, i.e. (800 and 801), in one field and forming 4,004 samples in five continuous fields are recorded on tilted 

tracks thereof, signal processing by which the samples reproduced by at least the first reproduction operation are all 
outputted from among the audio signals obtained by reproducing at least twice video signals of the same field during 

a speed change reproduction mode in which reproduction is made at least twice for an arbitrary field by a dynamic 
tracking head (2A), and by which samples by other reproduction are adaptively controlled so that the total sample 

number of five fields becomes not greater than 4,004 samples, is carried out by a deshuffling circuit of a first audio 
processing portion (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an audio signal reproducing
apparatus for reproducing audio signals from a recording medium
in which an audio signal having M samples aliquant with N is
recorded along with every image signal of consecutive N fields,
M and N representing natural numbers. The reproducing apparatus
is adapted for a composite digital D-2 format video tape recorder
(VTR).Conventionally, the digital VTR converts video signals and
audio signals into corresponding digital data and records the
resulting video data and audio data on a helical track of a
magnetic tape with a rotary head.With the digital D-2 format VTR, three longitudinal tracks,
that is, a time code track TRTC having a time code recorded
therein, a control track TRCTL having a control signal for
providing a servo reference recorded therein and a cue audio
track TRCUA having an editing cue audio signal recorded therein,
and a helical track TRPRG called program track having a video data
and audio data recorded therein are specified, as shown in Fig. 1.
One helical track TRPRG is composed of a central video sector VS
and audio signal sectors AS1, AS2 before and after the video
sector VS. The digital D-2 format VTR records video data in which one
field consists of 3 segments/6 tracks, along with audio data, on
a magnetic tape with two pairs of recording rotary magnetic heads
provided to face each other with an angle of 180° in a rotary
drum. The digital D-2 format VTR also reproduces the video data
and the audio data recorded on the magnetic tape, with two pairs
of reproducing magnetic heads provided to face each other with
an angle of 180° in the rotary drum.In a so-called helical scan type video tape recorder for
recording/reproducing image signals via helical tracks on the
magnetic tape, dynamic tracking control is performed by a head
shifting device using an electrical/mechanical converting element
such as a bimorph for shifting the reproducing rotary magnetic
head to traverse the helical tracks on the magnetic tape in
variable reproduction, in response to the demand for accurately
scanning the helical tracks with the reproducing rotary magnetic
head. The reproducing rotary magnetic head shifted by the head
shifting device is referred to as a dynamic tracking head or DT
head.The digital D-2 format VTR is so designed that the number
of samples is allocated to the audio sectors of each helical
track to have a total of 4004 samples for 5 fields, in accordance
with the number of helical tracks, the number of audio channels
and the number of
