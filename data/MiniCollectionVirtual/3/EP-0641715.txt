<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the packaging of a plurality of containers to form so-called multiple packs by the use of a packaging-material blank which is wrapped round the arrangement consisting of a plurality of containers or which is filled with this, the method being characterised by the following method steps:   a) provision of a plurality of individual blanks in the form of a continuous composite structure (10);   b) provision of individual container arrangements; c) transportation of the container arrangements wrapped in the composite structure (10) and in the form of a continuous composite structure (17) to the outlet of the machine and d) if appropriate, severance of the composite structure of the individual multiple packs or direct palletisation of individual multiple packs in the composite structure (17).

Process for packaging a number of containers in a multipack using a packaging
material blank that is wrapped around a group consisting of several different

containers, where a large number of connected packaging material blanks are
fed in that in addition to crease lines and/or cut-outs also have lines of

weakening for separating the multipacks from each other, where the containers
are supplied in at least one uninterrupted row at the same time as the packaging

material blanks and where individual or several packaging units are separated
during or at the end of the packaging process, 
wherein
 at least the lines of
weakening are produced in the blanks in the machine for applying the

packaging material blanks to the containers.
Process according to claim 1, 
wherein
 several connected packaging material
blanks are separated before being applied to the containers.
Process according to claim 1, 
wherein
 individual or several connected
packaging material blanks are separated alter the packaging process has been

completed. 
Process according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the crease lines and/or cut-outs are also
produced in the connected packaging material blanks in the machine for

applying the packaging material blanks to the containers.
