<ABSTRACT>
A device for guiding and deflecting photographic strip (tape, web) material (B) has an inlet opening (E) for the incoming strip material and an exit opening (A) for the strip material which is passed out. The device initially threads in the incoming strip material (B) and then forms a strip-material loop which hangs down between the inlet opening (E) and the exit opening (A). Both in the vicinity of the inlet opening (E) and in the vicinity of the exit opening (A), a deflecting member (1,2) is provided which can be pivoted between a threading-in position and a deflecting position. Each deflecting member (1,2) has two axes (10,11,21,22) on which there is provided in each case a rotatable disc (100,110,200,210) which is arranged coaxially with the respective axis (10,11). A joint endless belt (12,22) is tensioned around the two discs (100,110,200,210). The two axes (10,11) can be adjusted relative to each other and are at the maximum distance from each other in the threading-in position.
