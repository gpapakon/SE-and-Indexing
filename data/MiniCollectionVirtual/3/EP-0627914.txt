<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions containing butylurea as a
contraceptive agent. Specifically, it is directed to the use
of butylurea as an agent for abrogating sperm motility.U.S. Patent No. 4,880,836 describes the use of alkylureas
as anti-viral agents effective against Herpes I virus, Herpes
II virus and the AIDS virus. This patent further describes
methods of treating viral infection in media such as blood
supply, blood bank and surfaces of all kinds by administering
to such media a monosubstituted alkylurea in a suitable
composition.Dasgupta, P.R. et al: Indian J. Exp. Biol., Vol. 9, 1971,
pages 414-415 discloses the ability of urea to inhibit sperm
motility and its use as contraceptive but does not disclose
any reference to the use of butylurea as a potential
contraceptive.Warren, J.R. et al; Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta, Vol.
420, 1976, pages 397-405 and Fr√∂hlich, O. et al: J. Membrane
Biol., Vol. 98, 1987, pages 33-42 disclose that alkylureas
have a higher protein denaturing potency than urea. Also that
the protein denaturing effectiveness of butylurea is greater
than that of other alkylureas tested, but there is no teaching
of the use of butylurea in the preparation of a contraceptive.It is an object of this invention to provide
contraceptive compositions containing 
butylurea which compositions are useful in abrogating sperm
motility, and methods of making such compositions.It is another object of this invention to provide
contraceptive compositions effective in abrogating sperm
motility, which compositions may be used either alone or in
conjunction with conventional contraceptive means, and methods
of making such compositions.This invention is directed to compositions containing butylurea as a
contraceptive agent, such a contraceptive agent being capable
of abrogating sperm motility. Butylurea may be used either
alone or in conjunction with conventional contraceptive means
as contraceptive agents.This invention is directed to
contraceptive compositions which are useful in
abrogating sperm motility and capable of enhancing the
contraceptive capabilities of conventional contraceptive
means, methods of making such contraceptive compositions,
methods of enhancing the contraceptive capabilities of
conventional contraceptive means and enhanced conventional
contraceptive means.Specifically, this invention is directed to 
the compositions containing butylurea as contraceptive agents capable of
abrogating sperm motility.The inventor has discovered that when sperm is put into
contact with

<CLAIMS>
A contraceptive comprising butylurea in combination with
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier wherein, the

pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a contraceptive foam or
a vaginal foam.
A contraceptive comprising a conventional contraceptive
used in combination with a contraceptive composition

comprising either butylurea alone or butylurea in combination
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The contraceptive according to Claim 2, wherein the
conventional contraceptive is a condom, a diaphragm or a

sponge.
The contraceptive according to Claim 2, wherein the
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a contraceptive foam or

a vaginal foam.
The contraceptive according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein the
conventional contraceptive is coated with the contraceptive

composition.
A method for the preparation of a contraceptive
comprising combining butylurea with a pharmaceutically

acceptable carrier, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier is a contraceptive foam or a vaginal foam. 
A method for preparing a contraceptive comprising
combining a conventional contraceptive with a contraceptive

composition comprising either butylurea alone or butylurea and
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The method according to Claim 7, wherein the conventional
contraceptive is a condom, a diaphragm or a sponge.
The method according to Claim 7 or 8, wherein the
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a contraceptive foam or

a vaginal foam.
The method according to any one of Claims 7 to 9, wherein
the conventional contraceptive is coated with the

contraceptive composition.
The method according to Claim 10, wherein the coating of
the conventional contraceptive is performed by priming the

conventional contraceptive with a conventional priming
treatment, coating the primed conventional contraceptive with

a liquid solution of hydrogel polymer and absorbing the
contraceptive composition into the hydrogel polymer.
