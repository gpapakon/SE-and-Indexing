<ABSTRACT>
A negative film masking system for use in a photographic processing and 
printing machine comprises a negative film masking assembly (12) 

consisiting mainly 
of a masking and a negative film hold-down (13) and a masking mount (2) 

to which the 
negative film masking assembly (12) is loaded, where photographic prints 

are produced 
from a negative film loaded in the negative film masking assembly (12) 

and having 
standard size frames and panoramic size frames in random combination, the 

panoramic size frame designated by masking both widthwise edges of the film in 
shooting to make two unexposed regions in a standard frame. 
The negative film masking system further comprises a four-sided film gate 
aperture in the masking which is identical in the size to the panoramic size 

frame (F2), a four-sided film gate aperture in the negative film 
hold-down which is 

identical in the size to the four-sided film gate aperture of the masking, 
detecting apertures (146) in particular positions of the masking which 

are off the 
four-sided film gate aperture and in the unexposed regions for the panoramic 

size frame and detecting aperture in the negative film hold-down (13) 
which communicate with the detecting apertures of the masking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a negative film masking system
comprising a negative film masking assembly which is attachable to a negative film masking mount at the printing station of a
known photographic processing and printing machine.A negative film masking system is disclosed in DE-B-1275353, in
which a guide plate and a platen each have four-sided film gate
apertures or cut outs, the cut out in the guide plate corresponding to
the size and shape of the underlying negative and the cut out in the
platen being slightly larger. On changing to a different format, a guide
plate and platen having different sized cut outs are substituted.A negative film masking system in the photographic processing and
printing machine is designed in which while a negative film loaded in a
negative film masking assembly is being advanced frame by frame, a
desired frame of the negative film is halted to locate in a four-sided
film gate aperture (at the exposure location) of the masking assembly
and exposed to produce a print on a sensitised paper as securely held
down with a film hold-down of the masking assembly.A common photographic negative film of the 135 roll or piece form
contains standard size frames and panoramic size frames in random
combination. Hence, printing of an image of the panoramic size requires
the use of a specific masking having a film gate aperture which is
identical in size to the panoramic frame.The use of such a specific masking is essential to measure the
transmission of light through the frame with LATD sensors which will be
described later. If a proportion of light transmitted through unexposed
regions of the film is 
detected, it interrupts the correct measurement.It is a good idea to have the masking system provided
with a detector capable of automatically distinguishing the
panoramic frame from the standard size frame on a negative
film for ease of printing operation. Although the masking
system with such a detector allows the operator to perform a
printing work with much ease, it will be high in the cost of
production.If no such detector is equipped with the masking system,
the operator has to check a negative film visually for
panoramic frames and remember or record the location of
those frames to be printed prior to loading the film to the
masking system.The memorization or recording of the location of panoramic
frames of the negative film is however troublesome
demanding an extra step of work in the printing operation.
Also, if any panoramic frame is incorrectly recognized or
recorded
