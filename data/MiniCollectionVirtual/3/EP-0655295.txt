<ABSTRACT>
A metal body, in particular a rolling ring, has a basic body 2 and a wear ring 6 sitting at the periphery, the basic body 2 being made of a material which has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion and a lower wear resistance than the material of the wear ring 6. In order to guarantee a good connection between wear ring 6 and basic body 2 at low manufacturing costs, the wear ring 6 is connected to the basic body 2 via a brazed joint 16, the wear ring 6 and the basic body 2 being dimensioned in relation to one another in such a way that, after the heating of basic body 2 and wear ring 6 necessary for making the brazed joint 16, shrinkage forces directed radially inwards are transmitted from the basic body 2 via the brazed joint 16 to the wear ring 6 as a result of the cooling.

Metal part, in particular a rolling ring, with a base and 
a wear ring sitting at the circumfernce thereof, whereby 

the base consists of a material with a higher heat 
expansion coefficient and lower wear resistance than the 

material of the wear ring, whereby the wear ring (6) is 
connected to the base (2) via a soldering joint (16),
 
characterized in that wear ring (6) and base (2) are 

designed relative to each other in such a manner that 
following the heating of the base (2) and wear ring (6) 

that is necessary for producing the soldernig joint (16), 
shrinking forces directed radially inward as a result of 

the cooling are transmitted by the base (2) via the 
soldernig joint (16) to the wear ring (6). 
Metal part as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the base (2) is divided in a division plane (7) that 

extends through the wear ring (6) into two base disks (3, 
4). 
Metal part as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the base disks (3,4 ) are located at a distance (7) 

relative to each other. 
Metal part as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the distance (7) is such that the base disks (3, 4) do 

not contact each other even during the heating to the 
temperature necessary for producing the soldernig joint 

(16).  
 
Metal part as claimed in one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the division plane extends through 

the center of the wear ring (6). 
Metal part as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the wear ring (6) sits within an 

annular groove (5) in the base, and the annular groove 
(5) has a V-shaped groove bottom (13). 
Metal parts as claimed in claims 5 and 6, characterized 

in that the groove bottom (13) is positioned 
symmetrically to the division plane. 
Metal part as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the wear ring (6) is connected over its full surface 

by way of soldering joint (16) with all its interior 
surfaces (13, 14, 15) with the annular groove (5). 
Process for the production of the metal part as claimed 
in one of claims 1 to 8, whereby a wear ring is produced 

and a base is produced from a material with a higher heat 
expansion coefficient and lower wear resistance than the 

material of the wear ring, and whereby the wear ring is 
subsequently fixed to the base in that solder material is 

applied at a connecting surface (13, 14, 15) between base 
(2) and wear ring (6), and that the metal part (1) is 

after the putting together of the wear ring (6) and base 
(2) heated to a temperatur necessary for producing a 

soldernig joint and is then cooled again, characterized 
in that base (2) and wear ring (6) are designed in such a 

manner during production that the base (2) develops such 
a radial shrinkage during the cooling of the metal part  

 
(1) that shrinking forces directed radially inward are 

transmitted via the soldernig joint (16) to the wear ring 
(6) resulting in a compressive strain via the cross-section 

thereof. 
Process as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that the 
soldernig joint (16) is produced under inert gas or in a 

vacuum. 
Process as claimed in claim 9 or 10, characterized in 
that at least the connecting surfaces (13, 14, 15) of 

base (2) and wear ring (6) intended for the soldering 
joint (16) are roughened. 
Process as claimed in one of claims 9 to 11, 
characterized in that the wear ring (6) is connected over 

ist full surface via all adjoining surfaces (13, 14, 15) 
with the base (2).
