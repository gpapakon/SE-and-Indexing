<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable
vehicle seat.In particular, the present invention relates to an
adjustable vehicle seat of the type comprising a main
frame; a seat portion; a backrest connected for rotation
to the main frame; first adjusting means for adjusting,
in use, the position of the seat portion in relation to
the vehicle floor; and second adjusting means for
adjusting the angular position of the backrest in
relation to the seat portion; the first adjusting means
comprising guide means fittable to the vehicle floor and
for longitudinally guiding the main frame, whereby
said first adjusting means also comprise an
actuating unit interposed between the seat portion and the main frame
(see, for example, EP-A-0 589 421).The seat portion of known adjustable seats of the
aforementioned type is normally adjusted vertically by
means of an inclined skid device wherein a first slide,
supporting the main frame and defined at the bottom by
an inclined edge, is connected in sliding manner to the
inclined top edge of a second slide mounted in sliding
manner on a longitudinal guide fitted to the vehicle
floor. Though relatively straightforward to produce,
devices of the aforementioned types are less than
satisfactory from the operating standpoint, by virtue of
vertical adjustment of the seat portion also resulting
automatically in an undesired change in its longitudinal
position.The above mentioned drawback is overcome by the
vehicle seats respectively described in EP-A-589 421 and
in DE-A-4 002 946. These vehicle seats comprise first
slides for adjusting the longitudinal position of the
seats and second slides, which are provided with
respective pins, engaged in vertical guides integral
with the first slides. The pins are arranged in axial
alignment in order to adjust the height of the vehicle
seat and, additionally, to rock the vehicle seat about
the pins.Nevertheless, vertical adjustment of the seat
portion obviously also results in a similar vertical
adjustment of the backrest, i.e. when adjusting the
position of the seat portion, the vertical position of
the backrest in relation to the seat portion remains
unchanged. As such, known adjustable seats are only
comfortable and practical for certain users, more
specifically those of average height for whom the
backrest is designed, and are relatively uncomfortable
for anyone well above or below average height.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an adjustable seat of the aforementioned type 
designed to overcome the aforementioned
