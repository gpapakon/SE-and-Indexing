<ABSTRACT>
A sheet feeding mechanism for feeding sheets of documentary material such as paper into a chute, from which the sheet material will enter a shredding machine (10). The sheet feeding mechanism comprises a housing (12) within which there is mounted a pair of rollers (14a 
&
cir
&
 _, 14b 
&
cir
&
 _) around which a belt (16) of flexible material, such as rubber, is located, drive mechanism (10) being provided for rotating one of the rollers (14), to cause the belt to rotate within the housing (12). A central portion of the upper reach of the belt (16) passes over a support plate (18), to support the belt against movement in a downward direction. Between termination of the support plate (18) and passage of the belt on to the roller (14b 
&
cir
&
 _), the belt passes beneath a control member in the form of a plate (19), urged by a spring (30) into a position in which it is spaced a short distance (X) from the upper reach of the belt. A presser plate (26) is provided to urge a stack of paper on the upper stretch of the belt towards the belt. Such paper is gripped by movement of the belt and fed towards the gap (X), and between the roller (14b 
&
cir
&
 _) and a second roller (15) along a chute (11) into a shredding machine (40). In the event of the belt picking up a plurality of adjacent sheets, as these are fed towards the gap (X), the belt (16) will be deflected downwardly, passage of the increased thickness of paper beneath the control member (19) against the deflection of the belt (16) increasing the frictional forces acting between the belt and the lowermost sheet of paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to sheet 
feeding mechanism. Difficulty is encountered in feeding sheet material from a stack 
thereof, particularly where it is desired to fed more than one sheet at a time, 
and/or where it is desired that the mechanism used is simple in its construction 
and relatively inexpensive. For example in the feeding of documentary sheet material (such as 
paper) from a stack thereof to a shredding machine, the number of sheets which 
it may be desired to feed at a time will be dependent upon the capacity of the 
shredding machine being used. For example, single sheet feeding will lead to an 
under utilisation of the shredding machine, whilst if the number of sheets which 
are fed exceeds a certain value, the shredding machine will tend to jam. Difficulties are encountered in conventional feeding mechanisms for 
such operations, particularly in the ability of the sheet feeding mechanism to cope 
with a number of sheets which may be stapled together. There is known from US-A-1866690 a sheet feeding mechanism 
comprising first and second spaced rollers, a flexible belt around the rollers, drive 
means to rotate the belt around the rollers, a support means to support an upper 
stretch of the belt as it moves from the first to the second roller, and a control 
member disposed above the upper stretch of the belt to provide with the belt a 
gap through which paper placed on the belt may be fed, the control member 
being disposed adjacent to a portion of the belt which is supported by the support 
means. Conversely, in accordance with this invention,  
 The control member is disposed above a portion of the belt 
where the belt passes from the support means and prior to the belt passing onto 
the second roller. Thus, the capability of the belt being flexed downwardly will 
be by virtue of the inherent flexibility of the belt, in an unsupported region 
thereof. Preferably means is provided to vary the size of the gap. In this 
manner, by setting the gap at an optimum level, paper placed on the belt will be 
transferred through the gap, conveniently being fed to chute means for conveying 
the paper into a shredding machine, the size of the gap controlling the number 
of pages fed simultaneously by the sheet feeding mechanism. However in the 
event that a large number of pages, some of which may be stapled together, being 
fed through the gap, the belt will be flexed downwardly to increase the effective 
size of the gap, permitting passage through the gap of an

member (19) disposed above the upper stretch of the belt to provide with the belt 

a gap (X) through which paper placed on the belt may be fed, charaterised in that 
the control member (19) is disposed above a portion of the belt (16) where the 

belt passes from the support means (18) and prior to the belt passing on to the 
second roller (14

provided to vary the size of the gap (X). 
A sheet feeding mechanism according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein 
the control member (19) is mounted for movement towards and away from the 

belt (16), means (30) being provided to urge the control member (19) towards the 
belt into engagement with an adjustable stop. 
A sheet feeding mechanism according to any one of the preceding 
claims comprising clamping means (22, 26) to urge a stack of paper downwardly 

against the belt. 
A sheet feeding mechanism according to Claim 4 wherein the clamping 
means comprises a member (26) which is mounted for movement so as to retain 

a disposition substantially parallel to the upper stretch of the belt (16).  
 
A sheet feeding mechanism according to one of Claims 4 and 5 
wherein the clamping member (26) is mounted on a cover (22) of the sheet 

feeding mechanism.
