<CLAIMS>
A housing for appliances used in the field of electrical 
datacommunication, for example telephone housings, formed by two half shells (10, 11) 

each with an interior part shaped from metal plating (13, 15) which is fixedly connected 
to a layer of thermoplastic material (12, 14) injection-moulded thereto which forms the 

outer shell of the housing. 
A housing as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the part shaped 
from metal plating (13, 15) and the outer shell (12, 14) of the housing made from 

thermoplastic material are fixedly connected to one another by injection moulding 
around edges or the like, or by means of special fastening elements (24). 
A housing as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the part (27) 
shaped from metal plating has movable tongues (30a, b) in the region of keys (30a, 34), 

which tongues are each connected at one side to said metal part (27) by means of at 
least one resilient bridge (31) and are covered by the layer of thermoplastic material 

(34, 35). 
A housing as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the tongues (30a, 
b) are each formed by a substantially semicircular incision (28). 
A housing as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the tongues (30b) 
are each provided with a central opening (33) and the thermoplastic layer (35) is made 

of a translucent material in the region of the central opening (33). 
A housing as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 5, formed by two 
housing shells (40, 41) with parts (43, 45) shaped from metal plating arranged therein, 

characterized in that the overlapping ends (43a, 45a) of the two parts (43, 45) shaped 
from metal plating form a projection (46) which is dovetail-shaped in cross-section and 

are held together by at least one closing element (47) which grips over the projection 
(46). 
A housing as claimed in Claim 6, characterized by a single, U-shaped 
closing element (47) which in the mounted state grips around an extreme edge and at 

least portions of the two side edges of the housing (40, 41).  
 
A housing as claimed in Claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the part (43') 
shaped from metal plating of the upper housing shell (40') is constructed as an 

uninterrupted surface in the region of the keyboard, on which surface a keyboard 
switching foil (52) is provided, for example glued, whose electrical connection lines 

(53) are passed through a single opening (54) into the housing interior. 
A method of manufacturing a housing as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
comprising by the following process steps: 


a) the metal part (13, 15) is forced into the desired shape in a deep-drawing tool 
(25), 
b) the metal part (13, 15) thus prepared is laid in an injection mould (26) which is 
formed so as to correspond to the desired outer contours of the housing, 
c) the inserted metal part (13, 15) is surrounded with injected thermoplastic 
material (12, 14), leaving exposed openings (16, 17) provided in the metal part 

(13, 15), in accordance with the desired outer contours of the housing. 
A method as claimed in Claim 9, characterized in that the part shaped 

from metal plating (13, 15) is provided with functional elements (19, 20, 21) at the 
inside in the region of openings (18) before injection moulding, and said functional 

elements (19, 20, 21) are connected to the outer shell (12, 14) during the injection 
moulding process by means of the injected material which passes through the openings 

(18). 
A method as claimed in Claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the part 
shaped from metal plating (13, 15) is provided with additional openings (23) and in that 

the material passing through these openings (23) during the injection moulding process 
forms additional connecting elements (24) between the part shaped from metal plating 

(13, 15) and the outer shell (12, 14).
