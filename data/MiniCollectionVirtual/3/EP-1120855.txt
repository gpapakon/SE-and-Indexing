<ABSTRACT>
An antenna device which can be housed within a small
portable radio receiver can be obtained by miniaturizing a small

loop antenna. A small antenna device is formed by connecting
nonlinear first and second conductors to a grounding conductor and

connecting these first and second conductors with a third conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a miniaturization of a loop antenna, and particularly to an antenna device which can be miniaturized by using a grounding conductor.Heretofore, in antenna devices, a miniaturized loop antenna is widely used in which, when a physical size of a one-wavelength loop antenna element 1 shown in FIG. 14 of the accompanying drawings is miniaturized without changing an electrical size thereof, as shown in FIG. 15, a loop antenna element 1a is miniaturized to a half-wavelength by using a grounding conductor 3. One end of this loop antenna element 1a is used as a short-circuit portion 4, and the other end thereof is used as a feed portion 2. The feed portion 2 supplies energy to the grounding conductor 3 via the half-wavelength loop antenna element 1a and the short-circuit portion 4, whereby the length of the loop antenna elment 1a can be reduced substantially to the half physically.FIG. 16 shows a specific arrangement of the above-described antenna device. As shown in FIG. 16, one end of the half-wavelength loop antenna element 1a having substantially U-like shape is connected to the feed portion 2 and the short-circuit portion 4 is connected to the grounding conductor 3. The half-wavelength loop antenna element 1a having substantially U-like shape is made of a linear conductor and is comprised of a third conductor 6 made of a linear conductor, formed between two conductors 5L and 5R, said two conductors 5L and 5R being disposed perpendicular to the grounding conductor 3.The antenna device described with reference to FIG. 16 has the folowing sizes. The length of a linear conductor portion 6 becomes 80 mm and the height of the conductors 5L and 5R become 40 mm even in 800 MHz band which is available in communication via a portable telephone, for example. This antenna device is large in physical size when it is used as an internal antenna device housed in the portable radio receiver or the like, for which the trend is towards increasing miniaturization. Hence, this antenna device becomes increasingly difficult to be incorporated within the housing of the portable radio receiver or the like.A PC card 9 conforming to the standards such as PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) is inserted into a PC card slot 8 of a notebook size personal computer (hereinafter referred to as a "notebook size PC") when it is in use as shown in FIG. 17. The PC card is used in other devices such as LAN (Local Area Network) and a portable telephone.The PC card 9 includes a radio
