<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display
apparatus and a fabrication method thereof, in particular, to
a liquid crystal display apparatus having a controlled display pixel
light transmittance and a fabrication
method thereof.Liquid crystal display apparatuses have been widely used
because of their characteristics such as thin size, light
weight, and low power consumption. For example, liquid
crystal display apparatuses have been used in various fields
as display devices including computers, car navigation
systems, and TV display systems.In recent years, liquid crystal display apparatuses that
have a large display screen and/or a high resolution have been
required. Accordingly, liquid crystal display apparatuses
having large screens of 14 inches in diagonal distance and/or
fine display pixel pitches of 100 µm or less have been studied
and developed.The liquid crystal display apparatuses having such large
screens and/or highly precise display screens are likely to 
increase the occurrences of defective pixels that
take place in the display screen.Although the occurrences of defective pixels may
be reduced to some extent by properly designing the liquid
crystal display apparatuses or improving the fabrication
processes thereof, the problem of the defective pixels have
not been completely solved. The defective pixels
are those having different voltage (V) - light
transmittance characteristics than normal pixels.To mute the defective pixels, for example an attempt for
designing a liquid crystal display apparatus with redundancy
has been made. In this attempt, a repair function is provided
so as to prevent the defective pixels. However, such a repair
function cannot deal with various defects. Thus, satisfactory
repair ratio cannot be achieved.As a defective pixel mode where the display quality of
the liquid crystal display apparatuses is remarkably
deteriorated, there are luminance point defects that take
place by various causes.Hereinafter, in a so-called normally white mode liquid
crystal display apparatus where the light transmittance is
maximum when the potential between the electrodes opposed with
the liquid crystal layer is lower than a predetermined
threshold value or less of the liquid crystal layer, the
luminance point defects represent defective pixels where light
transmittance does not decrease corresponding to the potential
between a pair of electrodes. On the other hand, in a so-called
normally black mode liquid crystal display apparatus 
where the light transmittance is minimum
