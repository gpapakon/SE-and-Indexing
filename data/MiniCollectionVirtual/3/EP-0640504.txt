<ABSTRACT>
This door reinforcement consists of an elongate reinforcing bar (1) which is held inside the door (4) and connects structural elements (40, 41) integral with the front and rear edges of this door, the said reinforcing bar, such as a telescopic bar (1) formed of two tubes (2, 3) which can slide one inside the other, has low or even zero resistance to axial compression resulting from a frontal impact, while it has very high strength with regard to bending towards the inside (EI) of the vehicle, which bending would result from a side impact. Vehicle safety equipment.

<CLAIMS>
Door reinforcement for a motor vehicle, which 
consists in an elongate armature (1;5) housed within the 

door (4) and linking front and rear structural elements 
(40, 41) thereof, characterized in that the said armature 

(1;5) has little or even no strength in axial compression 
resulting from a frontal impact (A), whereas it has high 

strength in bending towards the interior of the vehicle, 
resulting from a side impact (L). 
Door reinforcement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said armature (1;5) is a telescopic 

bar made up of two parts such as tubes (2, 3; 6, 7) able 
to slide one inside the other. 
Door reinforcement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the said telescopic bar (1;5) is provided 

with means forming a stop, which prevent it from being 
extended. 
Door reinforcement according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the said means consist in peripheral pegs 

(20) secured to the inner tube (2) and which engage in 
longitudinal slots (30) made in the outer tube (3). 
Door reinforcement according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the pegs (20) and the slots (30) are 

positioned on the side facing the interior space (EI) of 
the vehicle. 
Door reinforcement according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the portion of the inner tube (2) 

that enters the outer tube (3) is longer than the slots 
(30).  

 
Reinforcement according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the said means forming a stop consist of a flared 

region (61) of the inner tube (6), able to come to bear 
against a narrowed region (71) of the outer tube (7). 
Reinforcement according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the inner tube (2) and outer tube 

(3) are kept centred one with respect to the other by one 
relatively long bearing surface (10; 8; 8'') or by two 

bearing surfaces (80, 81) spaced apart.
