A head (14) is integral with the shank (10), and the head (14) includes a surface (20) disposed generally normal to the axis. A plurality of drive receivers (24) are disposed about the surface (20) wholly remote from the axis. Each of the drive receivers (24) is adapted for engagement with a cooperating driver element (44) of a rotary driver (D1) so that the head (14) and thereby the shank (10) may be rotated about the axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bone screw comprising:
a) a threaded shank having an axis of rotation;b) a head integral with said shank, said head including a
surface disposed generally normal to said axis and said
head and said shank being formed from a bioabsorbable
material;c) driver means disposed on said surface, whereby the
driver means are adapted for
engagement with a cooperating driver element of a rotary
driver so that said head and thereby said shank may be
rotated about said axis, andd) a bore coaxial with said axis and extending inwardly
from said surfaceMoreover the invention relates to a tool for fixing such a
screw.The internal fixation of bone fragments through the utilization
of bone screws is well known. The screws may be manufactured
from metal, but metal screws may need to be removed
after the fragments have knitted.Absorbable materials have recently been developed for various
medical applications, including for the fixation of bone fragments.
Absorbable materials avoid the need for removal of the
bone screw at a subsequent date, thereby eliminating the need
for additional surgery.Because the bone screw is screwed into the fragments in order
to fix them, there is a need for a tool which rotates the
screw about its longitudinal axis. Placement of the bone screw
may require great accuracy, and various devices have been
proposed for fixing a bone screw relative to its cooperating
driver. Absorbable bone screws, however, generally are formed
from naterials not having the strength characteristics of
metal, so that prior surgical screwdrivers may not maintain 
proper orientation of the screw relative to the driver. The
absorbable screw may, for example, become cocked or knocked
off axis during insertion, with the result that the screw may
not be properly inserted. In addition, the surgeon may not
have a clear view of the screw during the entire installation
process, because the view may be blocked by tissue, blood or
the like, so as to be unaware that the screw has not been
properly positioned.A bone screw made of a bioabsorbable material according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-⊘ 451 932. The bone
screw comprises a threaded shank and a head, in which a recess
for the introduction of a rotary driver is situated.From the recess there extends a through-going bore to the tip
of the bone screw, in which a guide pin is inserted for increasing
the longitudinal rigidity of the bone screw and thus
preventing the soft absorbable material of head and shank from
being distorted
