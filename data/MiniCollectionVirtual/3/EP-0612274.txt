 -1-vrTitle: METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY FORMING FOUR METAL ROUNDSSPECIFICATIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to the forming of small 5 diameter metal rounds, such as reinforcing bar rounds. More specifically, this invention relates to methods and apparatus for simultaneously forming by rolling four rounds of uniform size.10 βackgrpμnd of tfte InventionThe forming of small diameter rounds from larger bars is known in the milling art. Generally, a large bar is successively passed through a series of rollers that reduce the cross sectional area of the bar and,15 through a number of intermediate steps, eventually forms the desired shape. Because the amount of the reduction of the cross sectional area on each pass through the rollers is limited, the smaller the cross sectional area of final product, the larger the number20 of roller passes, machinery and production floor space required.The simultaneous forming of multiple rounds significantly reduces the above-stated problems because the reduction in total cross sectional area is25 considerably less, therefore, fewer intermediate steps are required and the speed and length of the end product is reduced.It is known in the art to simultaneously produce two uniform metal rounds and three uniform metal 

 -2- rounds. The simultaneous production-of three rounds is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,357,819.The additional problems involved in producing four rounds simultaneously from one bar are significant. The problems include maintaining the uniformity of the cross sectional areas of the strands as well as avoiding the cobbling of the strands during the slitting process. Other considerations include the resistance produced when separating the strands, which resistance can result in excessive heat, lower separating speeds and lower efficiency.filiimnΛT-Y τf the InventionThis invention discloses apparatus for use in simultaneously forming four metal rounds. The apparatus includes a irst pair and a second pair of forming rollers. These forming rollers are connected in series to sequentially pass a bar. Each pair has an adjustable separation distance. Grooves are formed in the surfaces of the first and second roller pairs. The grooves are dimensioned in combination such that the bar, at the completion of the second pass, is formed into four portions of substantially equal areas. The apparatus includes a pair of pre-εlitter rollers connected downstream from the forming roller pairs. The pre-slitter rollers have an adjustable separation

I CLAIM; 1. Apparatus for use in simultaneously forming four metal rounds comprising: a first pair and a second pair of forming rollers connected in series to sequentially pass a bar, each pair having an adjustable separation distance; grooves in the surfaces of the first and second roller pairs, dimensioned in combination to form the bar at the completion of the second pass into four portions of substantially equal cross sectional area; and a pair of pre-slitter rollers connected downstream of the first and second roller pairs, the pair having an adjustable separation distance and wherein at least one pre-slitter roller has two central grooves defining a free space and three serial ridges; the pre-slitter grooves and pre-slitter ridges dimensioned in combination with the grooves of the first and second forming roller pairs to form a bar comprised of four serial strands of substantially equal cross sectional area separated by thin connecting portions.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each roller of the first roller pair has a groove oriented with respect to the entering bar such that each groove forms an end portion of the bar, the separation distance between the surfaces of the first roller pair determining the width of the bar and the width of the groove in each roller of the first pair determining the cross sectional height of an end portion of the bar.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the rollers of the second pair are oriented with respect to the entering bar such that the separation distance between 


the roller sur aces determine the height of the central portion of the bar.
4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein the rollers of the second pair have ridges for forming the bar into four portions separated by thick connecting portions.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the two outside ridges of the pre-slitter roller have outside and inside slope angles of approximately 30°.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the inside ridge of the pre-slitter roller has slope angles of approximately 30°.
7. Apparatus for use in simultaneously forming metal rounds from a bar guided to the apparatus, the bar being comprised of four serial strands, two outside and two middle, separated by thin connecting portions, the apparatus comprising: a first pair of slitter rollers, a first ridge and a second ridge on each roller of the first pair, each ridge located to correspond with a thin portion connecting an outside strand to a middle strand and having an outside slope angle greater than the inside slope angle of the corresponding portion of the outside strand; and means serially connected downstream of the first pair of slitter rollers for separating the two middle strands.
8. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the outside slope angles of the ridges of the first slitter rollers exceed the inside slope angles of the corresponding portions of the outside strands by approximately 22°. 


 9. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the outside slope angles of the ridges of the first slitter rollers are approximately 52°.
10. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the inside slope angle of each ridge of the first slitter rollers is less than the outside slope angle of the corresponding portions of the middle strand.
11. The apparatus of claim 10 wherein the inside slope angles of the ridges of the first slitter rollers are approximately 25°.
12. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the means for separating the two middle strands is comprised of a second slitter roller pair, at least one roller having a ridge located to correspond to the thin connecting portion between the two middle strands, the slope angles of the second slitter roller ridge, being greater than the corresponding inside slope angle of the middle strand.
13. The apparatus of claim 12 wherein the slope angles of the ridge exceed the corresponding inside slope angles of middle strands by approximately 5°.
14. The apparatus of claim 13 wherein the slope angles of the ridge are approximately 35°.
15. A method for forming a bar to be slit and simultaneously formed into four metal rounds, comprising: adjusting the separation distance between a first pair of forming rollers and between a second pair of forming rollers; 


 7
-20- passing a bar by the first pair of rollers to form a bar of fixed cross sectional width and 
'
fixed cross sectional height over end portions of the bar; passing a bar by the second pair of rollers to form a bar of fixed cross sectional height over a central portion of the bar; and subsequent to the above steps, passing the bar by a pair of pre-slitter rollers having three ridges to form four serial strands of approximately equal cross sectional area separated by thin connecting portions.
16. A method for slitting a bar comprised of four serial strands, two outside and two middle, of approximately equal cross sectional area separated by thin connecting portions, comprising: passing the bar by a first pair of slitter rollers, each having two ridges with interfering outside slope angles and noninterfering inside slope angles, thereby separating each outside strand from the two middle strands by applying a lateral force with portions of the outside surf ce of the ridge to portions of the inside surface of an outside strand without applying significant lateral force with the inside surface of a ridge to the outside surface of a middle strand; and subsequently separating the two middle strands.
