<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel composition comprising coagulation factor VIII and a non-ionic surfactant such as block copolymers, e.g. polyoxamers or polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan fatty acid esters e.g. polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80 as stabilizer. The composition can also comprise sodium chloride, calcium chloride, L-histidine and/or sugars or sugar alcohols. The invention also relates to the use of a non-ionic surfactant as stabilizer for a composition comprising coagulation factor VIII.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel formulation comprising coagulation
factor VIII, L-histidine and a non-ionic surfactant such as block co-polymers, e.g.
polyoxamers or polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan fatty acid esters e.g.
polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80. The composition can also comprise sodium
chloride, calcium chloride, and/or sugars and/or sugar alcohols.Haemophilia is an inherited disease which has been known for centuries but
it is only within the last three decades that it has been possible to
differentiate between the various forms; haemophilia A, haemophilia B and
haemophilia C. Haemophilia A is the most frequent form. It affects only
males with an incidence of one or two individuals per 10 000 live-born
males. The disease is caused by strongly decreased level or absence of
biologically active coagulation factor VIII (antihaemophilic factor) which is a
protein normally present in plasma. The clinical manifestation of
haemophilia A is a strong bleeding tendency and before treatment with
factor VIII concentrates was introduced, the mean age of those patients was
less than 20 years. Concentrates of factor VIII obtained from plasma have
been available for about three decades. This has improved the situation for
treatment of haemophilia patients considerably and given them possibility
to live a normal life.Therapeutic factor VIII concentrates have until now been prepared by
fractionation of plasma. However, there are now methods available for
production of factor VIII in cell culture using recombinant DNA techniques
as reported in e.g. J Gitschier et al. Nature 312, 330-37, 1984 and EP 160 457.Factor VIII concentrates derived from human plasma contain several
fragmented fully active factor VIII forms (Andersson et al, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA, Vol 83,2979-83, May 1986). The smallest active form has a 
molecular mass of 170 kDa and consists of two chains of 90 kDa and 80 kDa
held together by a metal ion bridge. Reference is here made to EP 197 901.
Kabi Pharmacia has developed a recombinant factor VIII product which
corresponds to the 170 kDa plasma factor VIII form in therapeutic factor VIII
concentrates. The truncated recombinant factor VIII molecule is termed r-VIII
SQ and is produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells in a cell
culture process in serum free medium at finite passage.The specific activity of r-VIII SQ could be more than 12 000 IU/mg protein
and preferably more than 14 000 IU/ mg. Activity of about 15 000 IU/mg
has been measured. About 10 000 IU VIII:C per mg protein has
