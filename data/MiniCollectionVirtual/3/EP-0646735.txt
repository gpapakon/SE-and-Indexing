<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic vibration-damping mount (support) including a first rigid reinforcing member (1) and a second rigid reinforcing member (2), an elastomeric body (3) which includes, on the one hand, a thick wall (4) joining the two rigid reinforcing members together and partially delimiting a working chamber (A) and, on the other hand, a thin wall (5) which partially delimits a compensation chamber (B) connected to the working chamber by a narrow passage (C), the two chambers and the narrow passage being filled with a fluid, the second reinforcing member being a plate, one face of which is secured in a sealed fashion to the elastomeric body in order to delimit with the latter the two chambers and the narrow passage, the thin wall substantially having the shape of a bell in which only the edge (51) is secured to the second reinforcing member.

Hydraulic vibration-damping mount intended to be 
interposed between two rigid elements in order to damp 

out vibrations between these two elements, essentially in 
a main direction of vibration Z, this mount including a 

first rigid reinforcing member (1) and a second rigid 
reinforcing member (2) which can be secured respectively 

to the two rigid elements to be joined together, an 
elastomeric body (3) which includes a
 thick wall (4) 
joining the two rigid reinforcing members (1, 2) to one 

another and partially delimiting a working chamber (A), 
this elastomeric body (3) further including a freely 

deformable thin wall (5) which partially delimits a 
compensation chamber (B) communicating with the working 

chamber (A) via a narrow duct (C), the two chambers (A, 
B) and the narrow duct (C) being filled with a liquid, 

one (2) of the two reinforcing members, hereafter termed 
second reinforcing member, being a plate which is 

substantially perpendicular to the main direction of 
vibration Z and which exhibits a face secured in leaktight 

fashion to the elastomeric body in order to 
delimit, together with the latter, the two chambers (A, 

B) and the narrow duct (C), the thick wall (4) exhibiting 
a substantially peripheral edge (4
1
) which is secured to 
the second reinforcing member (2),
characterized in that
 the thin wall (5) substantially 
exhibits the shape of a bell including a substantially 

peripheral edge (5
1
) which is secured to the second 
reinforcing member, said thin wall being connected to the 

thick wall (4) only by part of said edge (5
1
), the working 
chamber (A) and compensation chamber (B) being 

juxtaposed non-concentrically on the face of the second 
reinforcing member (2) which is secured to the elastomeric 

body (3). 
Vibration-damping mount according to Claim 1, in 
which the edges (4
1
, 5
1
) of the thick wall and of the thin 
wall of the elastomeric body are overmolded onto a rigid 

perforated plate (6) which is fixed to the second reinforcing 
member (2).  

 
Vibration-damping mount according to either one 
of Claims 1 and 2, in which the narrow duct (C) is formed 

by a groove (7) in the perforated plate (6), the edges of 
said groove being applied in leaktight contact against 

the second reinforcing member (2). 
Vibration-damping mount according to any one of 
the preceding claims, in which the first reinforcing 

member (1) is a member which is elongate along an axis X 
substantially perpendicular to the main direction of 

vibration Z, the mount further including a rigid hoop (8) 
which is fixed to the second reinforcing member and which 

is located around the first reinforcing member and the 
elastomeric body, the elastomeric body including at least 

a first boss (9) which extends opposite the second 
reinforcing member from the first reinforcing member, 

this first boss being suitable for abutting against the 
hoop (8) in order to limit the travel of the first 

reinforcing member away from the second reinforcing 
member in the main direction of vibration Z. 
Vibration-damping mount according to Claim 4, in 
which the elastomeric body includes a second boss (10) 

which extends toward the second reinforcing member (2) 
from the first reinforcing member (1) and which penetrates 

inside the working chamber (A) in order to limit 
the travel of the first reinforcing member toward the 

second reinforcing member. 
Vibration-damping mount according to either one 
of Claims 4 and 5, in which the elastomeric body further 

includes at least one lateral boss (11, 12) which extends 
toward the hoop (8) substantially perpendicularly to the 

main direction of vibration Z from the first reinforcing 
member (1), and which is suitable for abutting against 

the hoop (8) in order to limit the excursion of the first 
reinforcing member parallel to the second reinforcing 

member. 
Vibration-damping mount according to any one of 
Claims 4 to 6, in which the hoop (8) is a curved plate, 

which covers the thin wall (5) of the elastomeric body. 
Vibration-damping mount according to any one of  
 

Claims 4 to 7, in which the compensation chamber (B) is 
aligned with respect to the working chamber (A) parallel 

to the axis X. 
Vibration-damping mount according to any one of 
Claims 4 to 8, in which the first reinforcing member (1) 

is a rigid arm which exhibits a part (1a) onto which the 
elastomeric body (3) is overmolded, and which also 

exhibits a projecting part (1b) extending out of the 
elastomeric body and provided with fixing means (1c). 
Vibration-damping mount according to any one of 
the preceding claims, in which the two chambers (A, B) 

are connected by a secondary passage (D) which is closed 
off by a valve (13) having a limited excursion. 
Vibration-damping mount according to Claim 10, in 
which the valve (13) is mounted on a support (14) which 

is interposed between the working chamber (A) and the 
second reinforcing member (2), the valve having one side 

in contact with the liquid contained in the working 
chamber (A) and one side pointing toward the second 

reinforcing member, which communicates with the compensation 
chamber (B) by means of the secondary passage (D), 

said secondary passage being formed between the elastomeric 
body (3) and the secondary reinforcing member 

(2).
