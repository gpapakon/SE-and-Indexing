<DESCRIPTION>
 NEW TETRAHYDRONAPHTHALENE DERIVATIVESThe invention relates to new tetrahydro- naphthalene derivatives of general formula ( I)whereinR1 represents a hydrogen atom,R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a Cι_4 alkoxycarbonylalkyl or benzyl group, or R1 and R2 together represent a group of formula - (CH2)3-,R3 represents a hydroxy, C^_ alkoxy or benzyl- oxy group or a group of general formula (A) ,whereinR5 represents a C1-4 alkyl group, and n represents 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, further¬ more to a process for preparing the same. Compounds of general formula (I) may be inSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 (E) configuration.In the C1« alkyl or C1-4 alkoxy groups the alkyl groups can be linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon groups, i.e. methyl, ethyl, n- or isopro- pγl, furthermore n-, sec- or t-b tyl groups.The new compounds of general formula (I) proved to be biologically active, they exerted significant antiulcer, i.e. cytoprotective effect.The invention relates furthermore to pharma- ceutical compositions containing new tetrahydro- naphthalene derivatives of general formula (I) - wherein R1, R2, R3 and n have the same meaning as above - and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, furthermore to a process for preparing the same. The therapeutic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) was studied in the following tests.Cytoprotective effect in the acidic alcohol induced gastric ulcer model(A. Robert: Gastroenterology, ~π_, 761-767, 1979) The study was performed in female rats weighing 120 - 150 g and starved for 24 hours. The test compound was administered in a suspension prepared with Tween 80, by gavage..After 30 minutes acidic alcohol, in doses of 0.5 ml/100 g body weight, was added similarly, by gavage. After one hour the animals were killed, their stomach was removed and cut along the curve. The reddish-brown strips (hemorrhagic lesions) were measured and their mean length pro stomach was calculated. The protective effect of the test compound was determined compared to the control group. The effect of the compound described in Example 1: ED5o= 0.1 g/kg p.o.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 Cytoprotective effect in the acetic acid induced chronic gastric ulcer model(Tagaki et al: Japanese Journal of Pharmacology 19. 418-426, 1969) The study was performed in female rats starved for 24 hours. The abdominal wall was opened under ether a nesthesis, and 25 μl of 20 % acetic acid solution was injected in the subserous layer of the glandular part of the stomach, near the pylorus. Then the abdominal
