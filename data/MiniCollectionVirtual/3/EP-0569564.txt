<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns heterocyclic compounds which are useful 
in inhibiting squalene synthetase, processes for their preparation and 
pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The present invention is 
also concerned with methods of using such heterocyclic compounds in 
diseases and medical conditions where inhibition of squalene synthetase 
is desirable, for example in treating diseases or medical conditions such 
as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Several different classes of compounds have been reported to 
possess the capability of being able to lower cholesterol levels in blood 
plasma. For example agents which inhibit the enzyme HMG CoA reductase, 
which is essential for the production of cholesterol, have been reported 
to reduce levels of serum cholesterol. Illustrative of this class of 
compounds is the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor known as lovastatin which is 
disclosed in US Patent No 4,231,938. Other agents which are reported to 
lower serum cholesterol include those which act by complexing with bile 
acids in the intestinal system and which are hence termed "bile acid 
sequestrants". It is believed that such agents act by sequestering bile 
acids within the intestinal tract. This results in a lowering of the 
levels of bile acid circulating in the enteroheptatic system and 
promoting replacement of bile acids by synthesis in the liver from 
cholesterol, which synthesis results, inter alia, in a lowering of 
circulating blood cholesterol levels. Squalene synthetase (also referred to as squalene synthase in 
the art) is a microsomal enzyme which catalyses the first committed step 
of cholesterol biosynthesis. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate 
(FPP) are condensed in the presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to form squalene. The inhibition 
of this committed step to cholesterol should leave unhindered 
biosynthetic pathways to ubiquinone, dolichol and isopentenyl t-RNA. 
Elevated cholesterol levels are known to be one of the main risk factors 
for ischaemic cardiovacsular disease. Thus, an agent which inhibits  
 
squalene synthetase should be useful in treating diseases and medical 
conditions in which a reduction in the levels of cholesterol is 
desirable, for example hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Thus far, the design of squalene synthetase inhibitors has 
concentrated on the preparation of analogues of the substrate farnesyl 
pyrophosphate (FPP), and hence on compounds which contain phosphorus 
groups . For
