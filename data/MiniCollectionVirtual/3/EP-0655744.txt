and outputting data in a parallel fashion in a unit of 

bits. The multibit memory has a memory cell array composed 
of mixed memory cells corresponding to different IO 

bits, data I/O terminals corresponding respectively to IO 
bits, an address terminal for inputting an address and 

internal data buses associated respectively with the IO 
bits and connected to the memory cell array. Further, the 

memory device has a test mode entry signal generator for 
generating a test mode entry signal indicative of entry 

into a test mode, a pseudo-address generator connected to 
the address terminal, for generating a pseudo-address in 

the test mode, and a connecting circuit responsive to the 
test mode entry signal for selecting one of the internal 

data buses depending on the pseudo-address and connecting 
the selected bus to predetermined one of the data I/O 

terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device, and more particularly to a multibit memory
for inputting and outputting data in a unit of bits.Semiconductor memory devices have a memory cell array
from which a memory cell can be selected by designating a
row address and a column address. Unless specially designed
otherwise, data are inputted to and outputted from
the memory cell array bit by bit. In a CPU to which such
a semiconductor memory device is connected, one word is
composed of plural bits, e.g., 16 bits or 32 bits, and
data are inputted to and outputted from the CPU word by
word. Since using as many semiconductor memory devices as
the number of bits on a data bus connected to a CPU is
limited by cost and package area considerations, there
have widely been developed semiconductor memory devices
capable of inputting and outputting data in a unit of
simultaneous parallel bits.A semiconductor memory device for inputting and
outputting data in a unit of bits will hereinafter be
referred to as a "multibit memory", and a bit serving as a 
unit for inputting and outputting data will hereinafter be
referred to as an "IO bit". A multibit memory has as many
data input/output terminals as the number of IO bits, and
each data input/output terminal is used to input and
output 1-bit data. Data are written in and read from a
multibit memory in a parallel fashion through the data
input/output terminals. Typically, the number of the IO
bits is 4, 8 or 16.Generally, a memory cell array of a multibit memory
may be divided per IO bit, or may be arranged to correspond
to a plurality of different IO bits. In former
memory cell array configuration, the number of IO bits is
limited by the number of divisions of the word length of
the memory cell array. For example, if the word length is
divided into four sections, then the memory cell array is
divided into four memory cell arrays, and these four
memory cell arrays can be accessed simultaneously. When
different IO bits are assigned respectively to the four
memory cell arrays, the memory cell arrays jointly make up
a memory whose IO bits are four bits. The number of
divisions of the word length is generally determined in
view of the time constant of word lines. If a word length
is divided into halves, then the number of memory cells
connected to a word line is reduced to one-half, and the
length of the line is reduced to one-half, with the result
that the time constant becomes one-quarter. Therefore, 
the number of divisions of a word line is determined
