<DESCRIPTION>
 DOW REAMING APPARATUSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention is in the field of rock boring machines, and more specifically such machines for reaming substantially vertical holes, or holes at a slight angle from true vertical, by initiating rock boring at ground level and boring a predetermined distance underground. No known down reaming apparatus is capable of boring substantially larger holes (preferably having a diameter of at least four meters) in a substantially continuous manner.U.S. Patent No. 3,965,995 issued to Sugden discloses a machine for boring a large diameter blind hole in a sequential, non-continuous manner. The cutterwheel is mounted at the lower end of the machine for rotation about a horizontal tubular support. A gripper assembly secures the machine against the tunnel wall while thrust cylinders thrust the rotatable cutterhead downwardly. As the machine is advanced, the cutterwheel is rotated to make a first cut in the shape of the leading portion of the cutterwheel. The cutterwheel is then retracted out from the cut and is rotated about the axis of the hole. This repositions the cutterwheel so that when it is advanced again, during the next cutting step, it will make a second cut which crosses the first. This procedure is repeated until the desired cross-sectional configuration (e.g. circular) of the hole is obtained. The above described sequential boring method employing a gripper assembly and thrust cylinders has been found to be time consuming and requires a complex and expensive machine. U.S. Patent No. 3,965,995 lists numerous prior art shaft forming machines, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.U.S. Patent No. 4,270,618 issued to Owens teaches an earth boring apparatus which is used for boring a blind pilot 

hole of a relatively small diameter which is subsequently enlarged by raise boring. Initially, the earth boring apparatus is employed to bore a blind pilot hole. Then the apparatus is removed from the hole and a room is blasted at the blind end of the hole. Next, the pilot hole cutterhead is replaced by a reamer and the apparatus is again inserted into the hole. The reamer is an adjustable diameter type and its diameter is increased once it is within the blasted room. The diameter of the reamer is increased by a plurality of cutter carrying arms which swing outwardly from the axis of rotation of the reamer. The earth boring apparatus is then raised from the room upwardly towards the ground surface to bore a hole of the desired
