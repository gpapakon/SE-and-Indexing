<ABSTRACT>
In a process for cleaning motor vehicles, a cleaning chemical (2) is applied on the surface (1) to be cleaned, then a high pressure cleaning liquid jet (4) is directly against the surface (1) to be cleaned and the motor vehicle and high pressure jet (4) are moved relative to each other until the high pressure jet (4) has touched the whole surface (1) to be cleaned. In order to use as sparingly as possible the cleaning chemical (2) while achieving a good cleaning effect, the high pressure jet (4) is directed against the surface (1) to be cleaned in a plane that forms an acute angle with the surface (6) that has not yet been touched by the high pressure jet. A device for carrying out the process is also disclosed.

Process for cleaning motor vehicles, wherein a cleaning 
chemical is applied to the surface (1) to be cleaned and 

subsequently a cleaning liquid in the form of a high 
pressure jet (4) is directed against the surface (1) to be 

cleaned and by relative movement of the motor vehicle and 
the high pressure jet (4) the entire surface (1) to be 

cleaned is covered by the high pressure jet (4), 
characterized in that the high pressure jet (4) is directed 

against the surface (1) to be cleaned in a plane forming an 
acute angle with the surface (6) not yet acted upon by the 

high pressure jet (4). 
Process as defined in claim 1, characterized in that the 
angle of the plane in relation to the surface (1) to be 

cleaned is between 10° and 60°. 
Process as defined in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a jet (4) spread fanwise in the plane, 

transversely thereto yet compact, is used. 
Device for cleaning motor vehicles as defined in the process 
of patent claim 1, having nozzles (3) for delivering a high 

pressure cleaning jet (4), characterized in that the exit 
axis of the nozzles (3) has a component in the direction 

towards areas (5) of the surface (1) to be cleaned already 
acted upon by the high pressure cleaning jet (4).
