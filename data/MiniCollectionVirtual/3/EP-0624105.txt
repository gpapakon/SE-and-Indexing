<ABSTRACT>
A catheter (10) for monitoring heart function comprises a catheter tube (12) having a plurality of lumens (14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26). The catheter (10) includes an inflatable balloon (68) at a distal tip of the catheter tube (12) for positioning the catheter (10) in a wedged position within a pulmonary artery within the heart of a patient. Dual injectate ports (80, 82) are formed in a side wall of the catheter tube (12). Each port (80, 82) communicates with a respective injectate lumen (24, 26) carried in the catheter tube (12). When inserted into the heart (100) of a patient, either the first (80) or second (82) injectate port is positioned within the desired distance from the tricuspid valve (120) for thermodilution depending upon the size of the heart (100). Thermodilution to obtain cardiac output and/or right heart ejection fraction is implemented by injecting injectate through the lumen (24, 26) associated with the port (80, 82) properly positioned relative the tricuspid valve (120) and discharged through the corresponding port (80, 82).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catheters, and, in 
particular, to catheters which utilize thermodilution 
techniques to measure cardiac output. Multiple lumen catheters are commonly used to measure 
and monitor cardiac output. In operation, the catheter is 
typically introduced into a central vein of a patient and 
advanced toward the right atrium through the superior or 
inferior vena cava. Once the distal tip of the catheter is 
positioned within the vena cava, a small balloon positioned 
over the distal tip is inflated through an inflation lumen 
provided in the catheter. The balloon carries the catheter 
along the flow of blood through the right atrium and right 
ventricle into the main pulmonary artery. The catheter 
continues to advance until a wedge position is reached 
within an individual pulmonary artery wherein the balloon 
seals off the inflow of blood through the artery. In this 
position, pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurements are 
commonly taken and the balloon then deflated. Subsequent to balloon deflation, thermodilution 
techniques are frequently utilized to measure cardiac 
output. Using thermodilution, a bolus of cold saline 
injectate is injected through a port in communication with 
one lumen of the catheter into the blood stream, and the 
resulting temperature change is measured with a thermistor 
located at a distal end of the catheter. Right heart 
ejection fraction can also be measured with thermodilution 
techniques in a known manner by further monitoring the 
occurrence of contractions using electrodes which are 
positioned at the distal end of the catheter within the 
right ventricle. To achieve optimum accuracy using thermodilution 
techniques, the injectate is injected into the right atrium 
in an abrupt manner so as to be evenly distributed and well  
 
mixed in the right ventricle prior to ejection through the 
pulmonary artery. Commonly, the injectate is injected 
through a port located approximately 5 cm proximal of the 
tricuspid valve, adjacent the right atrium. When injected 
in this manner, the injectate flows countercurrent to the 
blood flow from the inferior vena cava, and thorough mixing 
with the incoming blood is achieved. Often, the injectate 
port comprises plural openings to further assist in 
injectate mixing and distribution within the blood stream. Because heart size varies from patient to patient, the 
location of the injectate port once the distal tip of the 
catheter is positioned within the individual pulmonary 
artery also varies. Often,
