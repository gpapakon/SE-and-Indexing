<ABSTRACT>
A composite implant prosthesis is constructed from discontinuous fibre 
reinforcement, to form a sandwich structure of layered stiffness. 
The method for constructing the composite implant prosthesis includes the 
steps of closed moulding technique of producing a core of discontinuous 

fibres, aligned predominantly longitudinally, and a first casing of 
predominantly circumferentially orientated discontinuous fibres. The two 

layers can be formed by means of either single closed moulding process, or 
multiple closed moulding process. To cater for the variation in the femoral 

canal geometry, an outer second casing in the form of a sleeve is formed 
using closed moulding technique, which can be bonded on to the implant prior 

to or during surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the form and structure of a composite implant prosthesis.Heretofore, patents WO-A-87-04961, EP-171884 and US-A-3-893-196 disclose composite
implant prosthesis comprising a core of continuous fibers extending over the entire length of
prosthesis formed by moulding and machining, over layed by a layer of transversely oriented
continuous fibres and additional layer of polymer to allow disposition adjacent to bone.The most relevant prior art is described in document
WO-A-93 19699,
which document falls under the provisions according to Art. 54(3) EPC. There is
disclosed composite implant comprising an elongated core
formed of short filament fibres having a length of less than four millimetres embedded in
thermoplastic polymer; and encasing the core, a sheath formed of elongated carbon filament
fibres embedded in a thermoplastic polymer wound around the core in layers and moulded
thereto.US patent no. 4,902,297 describes the above mentioned machining of core as detrimental. It
discloses a composite implant prosthesis formed by a plurality of substantially unidirectional
strands of fibre, each fibre extending substantially over the complete length of the core, an
inner casing defined by braided material enclosing the core, and an outer casing enclosing the
inner casing. The core and the inner casing defining a substantially uniform width from one
end to the other end, while the outer casing defines an irregular width from one end to the
other to accommodate disposition of the prosthesis adjacent to a bone. Here the core is
subjected to a substantial portion of the load applied to the composite hip prosthesis. Since
the dimension of the core and first casing are substantially constant along the implant length
from one end to the other, variation in the stiffness along the length of implant can not be
accommodated with this design. This shortcoming is due to the manufacturing process
employed in the making of the core and first casing. Here the core and first casing are made
into a single straight rod of uniform width using pultrusion. This rod is then placed into a
forming press where heat and pressure are used to form or bend the rod to the shape of the
implant.With the present invention it is possible to form a composite implant prosthesis comprises of a
core and first casing which can vary in width from one end to the other. This allows the width 
of the core and first casing to vary along the implant length to achieve variation in the implant
stiffness along the implant length from

<CLAIMS>
A composite implant prosthesis comprising a core (1) having a matrix and a first casing
(2) wherein:


the core (1) formed by reinforcement of the matrix using discontinuous fibres aligned
predominantly unidirectionally along the implant length, and the first casing (2)

enclosing the core (1), with discontinuous fibres predominantly oriented transversely
to that of the core (1) to form a circumferentially reinforced first casing (2).

implant prosthesis along its length, is controlled by means of varying the dimensions of

the aligned core (1) and first casing (2) along the length of the implant.
