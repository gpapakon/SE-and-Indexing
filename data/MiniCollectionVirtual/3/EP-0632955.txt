<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a self-propelled harvester for the harvesting of delicate crops, such as, for example, castor-oil seeds.   In order by simple means to achieve an extremely careful harvesting of delicate crops, in which the outer relatively hard husk is destroyed, but the inner kernel or bean remains undamaged, there are arranged on the circumference of the threshing drum (24), at an equal angular distance from one another and axis-parallel to the axis of rotation 32 of the threshing drum, elastic profiled bars 47, for example in the form of hoses or tubes of annular cross-section, which are fastened to a plurality of holders 42; 43; 44; 45; 46 mounted on the threshing-drum shaft 32.

<CLAIMS>
A self-propelled apparatus for harvesting delicate crop material,
for example castor-oil capsules, provided with a threshing mechanism which

is essentially formed from a rotatingly drivable thrashing drum, at the
periphery of which profile bars are fixed on holders at the same angular

spacing relative to each other and in axis-parallel relationship with
respect to the axis of rotation of the thrashing drum, and a concave which

is stationarily arranged below same and which is provided with an elastic
covering at the side towards the thrashing drum, characterised in that the

profile bars are in the form of elastic hose bodies (47) of a cross-section
substantially in the form of a circular ring.
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the elastic
hose bodies (47) extend alternately from the left-hand or right-hand end

into the middle region, wherein the free ends of the mutually adjacent
elastic hose bodies (47), with respect to the length thereof, overlap by a

small amount.
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that each holder is
essentially formed from a chain wheel (40, 41, 42) mounted on the

thrashing drum shaft (32) and an endless roller chain (43) which engages
into the tooth configuration, and that angle securing members (45, 46) are

fitted to the roller chain (43) for fixing the elastic hose bodies (47).
Apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in that at least two
ch
ain wheels (40, 41, 42), preferably the outer chain wheels (40, 41), are
fixedly connected to the thrashing drum shaft (32) and that all chain

wheels (40, 41, 42) are provided with at least one through bore which is
in axis-parallel relationship with respect to the central bore and through

which is passed an entrainment rod (49) which is prevented from moving
axially. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that at each of its
two ends the entrainment rod (49) is provided with a respective

screwthreaded projection portion on to which nuts (52) are screwed for
securing the rod in axis-parallel relationship.
Apparatus according to claim 4 and claim 5 characterised in that
the entrainment rod (49) is formed from an outer tube (50) and a round bar

(51) which has the screwthreaded projection portions and which is disposed
within the outer tube (50) and that for positioning the chain wheels (40,

41, 42) which are not fixedly connected to the threshing drum shaft (32)
the outer tube (50) is provided at defined locations with securing rings

(53, 54) which are arranged in pairs and which are fitted into annular
grooves.
Apparatus according to claim 6 characterised in that the outer tube
(50) closingly engages with its end regions into recesses in the outer

chain wheels (40, 41).
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the outer
chain wheels (40, 41) are fixedly connected to the drive discs.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims
characterised in that the chain wheels (42) have three through bores which

are displaced through an angle of 120Â° and through which three entrainment
rods (49) are passed.
