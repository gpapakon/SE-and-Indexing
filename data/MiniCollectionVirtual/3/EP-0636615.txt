<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel 2-arylaminopyrimidinone 
derivative, and a selective herbicide and a plant growth 
regulator containing said derivative as an active ingredient. It is clear that accompanied with recent worldwide increase 
in population, productivities of important crops will 
influence food economy in various countries. Accompanied 
with these changes, a conventional agricultural system will 
be inevitably changed toward the 21st century. At present, 
development of a herbicide which can economically and 
efficiently kill or control weeds which are problems when 
crops are grown has been demanded more strongly by farm 
workers as compared with before. As such a herbicide, development of a chemical which can 
meet the following requirements has been desired. There have been desired a chemical having a high herbicidal 
effect with a small dose (it is necessary to kill weeds by 
spraying a dose as small as possible particularly from the 
standpoint of protection of environment), a chemical having 
a moderate residual effect (in recent years, there has been 
a problem that a chemical which remains in soil for a long 
time causes damage to subsequent crops so that it is important  
 
to have a moderate residual effect after spraying), a 
chemical which can kill weeds rapidly after spraying (after 
treatment with a chemical, next crops can be planted or 
transplanted in a short period), a chemical of which the 
number of treatment times is small (for farm workers, it is 
important to reduce the number of times of cumbersome weed-controlling 
operation as far as possible), a chemical having 
weed-controlling effects on various weeds (a chemical 
which can control weeds having different properties such as 
broad-leaved weeds, grass weeds, perennial weeds, etc. by 
itself is desired), a chemical having many application 
methods (if a chemical has a soil treatment effect, a stem 
and foliar treatment effect, etc., a stronger herbicidal 
effect can be obtained) and a chemical which does not cause 
problematical chemical damage to crops (it is preferred to 
kill only weeds selectively in a cultivated field where 
crops and weeds coexist). However, existing herbicides 
cannot meet all of these requirements. Further, in order to regulate growth of a plant by a chemical 
substance, there have been used conventional commercially 
available chemicals, for example, daminozide (general 
name), maleic hydrazide (general name), mefluidide 
(general name), etc. for the purpose of controlling growth 
of a
