<ABSTRACT>
An electrode has a slab-shaped (plate-like) electrode element (1) which predominantly consists of a ceramic material with an electron-conducting surface, the electrode element being roughened at its edge (2) and there being provided with a plastic coating (3) which embraces it in the shape of a U and in turn is welded, so as to be gas tight and liquid-tight, to a frame (4) which embraces the electrode element, is made of plastic and has a U-shaped profile. This outer plastic frame may in turn be surrounded by a sealing element (8) which can be inflated (for example by means of compressed air), to form sealed electrolyte compartments when used in a cell container. The slab-shaped ceramic material acting as the electrode element essentially comprises titanium oxide of the Magnelli phase, the surface, for activation purposes, optionally being provided with platinum metal or platinum metal compounds. A process for fabricating the electrode, an electrode and the use of an electrode as a bipolar electrode in an electrochemical cell arrangement are specified.
