<ABSTRACT>
For the articulation of removable motor-vehicle doors (1) which are articulated on a door column (4) of the vehicle body (5) via two hinges which are arranged at a vertical distance from one another and are designed particularly as wing hinges (2,3) and which are each equipped with a maintenance-free mounting (15) of the hinge pin (6,7), it is proposed, in order to make the production and assembly of the door articulation simpler and cheaper, that one of the two hinges (2,3) be designed and arranged as a pure guide bearing and the other of the two hinges (2,3) as a supporting and guide bearing, the hinge designed as a pure guide bearing being of the simplest type.

Hinged mounting of detachable motor vehicle doors comprising a door pillar (4)
of a vehicle body (5) and a vehicle door (1), the vehicle door (1) being articulated

on the door pillar (4) by an upper and a lower respectively detachable leaf hinge
(2, 3), each comprising a door-side hinge plate and a hinge plate of the door pillar,

the two door hinges (2, 3) being disposed in one common axis of rotation, at least
one of the two leaf hinges (2, 3) being equipped with a safeguard against

unintended detachment of the vehicle door (1), characterised in that the hinge
plates on the door and on the door pillar are disposed at difference distances from

one another on the door (1) on the one hand and on the door pillar (4) on the
other, and in that one of the two leaf hinges (2, 3) is constructed as just a radial

guide bearing, while the other is constructed as a combined axial support and
radial guide bearing, whereby in the case of the other leaf hinge which is

constructed as a combined axial support and radial guide bearing, the mutually
facing joint surfaces ofthe two hinge lugs rest on each other in the axial direction

while in the case of the leaf hinge which is constructed just as a radial guide
bearing, there is a gap-like intermediate space between the two mutually facing

joint surfaces ofthe two hinge lugs, so that freedom of contact is retained even if
a collar bush is used as a maintenance-free mounting.
Hinged mounting according to claim 1, characterised in that the maintenance-free
mounting, particularly a bearing bush of maintenance-free bearing material, of the

hinge pin is in each case disposed in the hinge lug of the detachable hinge leaf,
particularly that on the door side.
Hinged mounting according to claim 1, characterised in that the maintenance-free
mounting, particularly a bearing bush of maintenance-free bearing material, of the

hinge pin is in each case disposed in the hinge lug of the hinge leaf, particularly
that on the bodywork side. 
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that one of
the two leaf hinges is constructed as a simple leaf hinge of which the two hinge

leaves each have a hinge lug while the other is constructed as a completely premounted
leaf hinge adapted to be fitted into a lastingly disposed supporting part,

particularly on the bodywork side, so that the complete hinge together with the
hinge pin and its mounting can be fitted onto a supporting part which is in

particular fixed on the door pillar.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the hinge
pin of one hinge half has a conical and convexly rounded construction of its free

end.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the hinge

lug fitted with the maintenance-free mounting for the hinge pin or the bearing bush
disposed therein and which is constructed from a maintenance-free bearing

material has a conically widened portion for insertion of the hinge pin.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the upper
hinge is constructed as a simple detachable leaf hinge with a hinge pin lastingly and

rotationally rigidly accommodated in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf while in the
hinge lug of the other hinge leaf there is a constantly housed bearing bush of a

maintenance-free bearing material.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the upper
and lower hinges are constructed as simple detachable leaf hinges with a hinge pin

housed lastingly and rotationally rigidly in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf and with,
lastingly accommodated in the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf, a bearing bush of

a maintenance-free bearing material and in that a safeguard against detachment is
associated only with the lower hinge. 
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the upper
hinge is constructed as a simple detachable leaf hinge with a hinge pin lastingly and

rotationally rigidly accommodated in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf and with,
lastingly accommodated in the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf, a bearing bush of

a maintenance-free bearing material and in that the lower hinge comprises,
lastingly accommodated in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf in maintenance-free

manner and mounted in a manner to be safeguarded against its wandering in an
axial direction and with the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf adapted to be fitted

onto the free end of and projecting beyond the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the upper
hinge is constructed as a simple detachable leaf hinge with a hinge pin lastingly and

rotationally rigidly accommodated in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf and with,
lastingly housed in the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf, a bearing bush of a

maintenance-free bearing material and in that the bottom hinge is constructed as
an inseparable hinge and can as a complete component be fitted onto a supporting

element fixed on the other door arrangement part during re-hanging of the doors.
Hinged mounting according to claim 10, characterised in that the bottom hinge
leaf, when the door is hung, is in a vertical direction supported on the supporting

part fixed to the body and is in form-locking engagement with a bore in the
support part fixed to the bodywork by means of a hinge pin extension which

projects down-wardly by the height of the hinge.
Hinged mounting according to one of the claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the
upper hinge is constructed as a simple detachable leaf hinge with a hinge pin

lastingly and rotationally rigidly housed in the hinge lug of one hinge leaf and with,
in the hinge lug of the other hinge leaf, a lastingly accommodated bearing bush of 

a maintenance-free bearing material and in that the bottom hinge is constructed as
a separable hinge in which the hinge pin is mounted by means of a maintenance-free

bearing in a middle hinge lug of one hinge leaf and is rotationally rigidly fixed
in an upper hinge lug of the other hinge leaf by means of a peripheral knurling and

has projecting downwardly from the middle hinge lug an extension piece which
engages a removable bottom hinge lug of the other hinge leaf
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the
safeguard against detachment is constituted by a screwed arrangement orientated

coaxially of the hinge pin and braced against the outer joint surface of the hinge
lug of the detachable hinge leaf.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the
safeguard against detachment is constituted by a bayonet type interlock so that

projections and recesses alternately disposed on one and on the other hinge leaf
inter-engage in form-locking manner over the operating pivot angle of the hinge.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 15, characterised in that the
safeguard against detachment is constituted by a securing means disposed in the

detachable hinge half and orientated radially of the hinge axis and, when in its
operative position, co-operating with the hinge pin in form-locking manner.
Hinged mounting according to one of claims 1 to 15, characterised in that the
safeguard against detachment is constituted by a securing means disposed in the

supporting part associated with the detachable hinge unit and aligned radially in
relation to the hinge axis while in its operative position it co-operates in form-locking

manner with the hinge pin or with an axial projection of the hinge pin.
