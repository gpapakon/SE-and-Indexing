Device for draining water used for washing bedridden 
patients for a water-tight mattress which can be deformed in 

the shape of a trough, characterised in that the above-mentioned 
device consists of mattress underlays (MU), which on 

the one hand incline (deform) the conventional mattress (BM) 
from the sides to the centre and from the head part to the 

foot end, a water-tight mattress overlay (MA) and a mattress 
compressing device (MPV) which is arranged centrally at the 

foot end of the conventional mattress in such a way that a 
drainage fitting (AS) of the water-tight mattress overlay (MA) 

can be inserted into the stabilised recess (V) produced in 
this way in the mattress. 
Washing water draining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the mattress underlays are inflatable, 

are designed similarly to an airbed (LM) and consist of 
respective laterally arranged chambers (K) of which the air 

volumes are configured such that, in the inflated condition, 
they lift the conventional mattress lying in the bed so it 

produces gradients both from the sides to the centre and from 
the head part to the foot end. 
Washing water draining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the mattress underlays are designed as 

foam elements (ST) and are configured such that, when 
underlaid on both sides, they lift the conventional mattress 

lying in the bed so it produces gradients both from the sides 
to the centre and from the head part to the foot end.  

 
Washing water draining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the mattress underlay is designed as a 

base grid (LR) which is raised and checked on both sides by 
hand or electrically, in that the conventional mattress has 

gradients from the sides to the centre and from the head and 
foot part and causes the raising of a lateral part of the base 

grid, in that the central part of the base grid is lifted in 
the head region and provides an additional stabilised gradient 

toward the foot end in the central region of the mattress. 
Washing water draining device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the outlet fitting (AS) is integrated 

into the water-tight mattress overlay (NA) at the foot end and 
a corresponding outlet hose is pushed on.
