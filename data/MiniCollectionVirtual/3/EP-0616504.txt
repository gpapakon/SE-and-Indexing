<CLAIMS>
Floor cleaning machine, in particular a scrubbing or 
polishing machine, with at least two horizontally suspended 

roller brushes (9) driven to rotate about their longitudinal 
axis, which carry out a countercurrent oscillating movement in 

the horizontal direction, superimposed on their rotation, 
characterised in that the roller brushes (9) are suspended on a 

chassis and respectively two of them are arranged to rotate about 
this same axis. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the oscillating movement of the roller brushes (9) is a 

translatory movement in the axial direction of the roller 
brushes. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that connected to each roller brush is at least one cam disc 

with axial cams, which travels on a counter-cam arranged in a 
fixed manner on the chassis. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that each roller brush has an operative connection to at least 

one eccentric drive. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that a crank shaft (19) is provided, whereof the crank pins 

have an operative connection to the roller brushes (9) by way of 
connecting rods (18). 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the maximum speed of the oscillating horizontal movement 

of the roller brushes corresponds essentially to the peripheral 
speed of the ends of the bristles. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that a drive motor (11) is provided for the rotary drive of  

 
the roller brushes (9). 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that provided for the rotary movement and for the oscillating 

axial movement are two drive motors, which can be operated 
independently of each other. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the oscillating horizontal movement of the roller brushes 

is forced by the drive motor (11) for the brush rotation. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the roller brushes (9) are mounted in a 

non-rotary, axially displaceable manner on at least one brush 
shaft (8) driven by a motor, able to rotate in the chassis and 

mounted to be axially stationary. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that instead of the roller brushes, at least two 

cleaning units are provided, which respectively comprise at least 
two guide rollers (23, 24) rotating about their horizontally 

aligned longitudinal axes, whereof at least one is driven in a 
rotary manner and a cleaning belt (25) travelling around the 

latter, the guide rollers of two cleaning units respectively 
being arranged to rotate about the same axis and carrying out a 

countercurrent oscillating movement in the horizontal direction. 
Floor cleaning machine according to Claim 1 or Claim 11, 
characterised in that in addition to their oscillating movement 

in the horizontal direction, the roller brushes (9) or the 
cleaning units carry out a swinging movement about a vertical 

swivel axis.
