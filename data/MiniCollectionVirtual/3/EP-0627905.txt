<ABSTRACT>
Absorbent articles such as disposable diapers, incontinent briefs, diaper holders and the like, that have improved dynamic fit and containment characteristics. The elasticized waistband (35) comprises a shaping panel zone (136); a waistline panel zone (138); and a predisposed, resilient, waistband flexural hinge zone (140) joining the shaping panel zone and the waistline panel zone to provide a restoring force/moment that returns the panel zones to their preceeding in-use configuration, especially when the elasticized waistband has been pretensioned by a closure system. The closure system maintains lateral tension through the elasticized waistband thereby allowing the elasticized waistband to expand and contract with the motions of the wearer. The absorbent article additionally preferably comprises a pair of "zerostrain" elasticized side panels (30) disposed in waist region (58). The present invention also relates to an expansive "tummy" panel elasticized waistband (635). The absorbent core comprises an acquisition/distribution core (1302) of chemically stiffened fibers and a storage core (1304).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as diapers, 
incontinent briefs, diaper holders, and the like, and more particularly, to 
absorbent articles having elastic waist features providing dynamic fit 
about the wearer as well as improved containment characteristics of the 
absorbent article. Infants and other incontinent individuals wear absorbent articles 
such as diapers to receive and contain urine and other body exudates. 
Absorbent articles function both to contain the discharged materials and to 
isolate these materials from the body of the wearer and from the wearer's 
garments and bed clothing. Disposable absorbent articles having many 
different basic designs are known to the art. For example, U.S. Patent Re. 
26, 152, entitled "Disposable Diaper" issued to Duncan and Baker on 
January 31, 1967, describes a disposable diaper which has achieved 
wide acceptance and commercial success. WO 91/11163 describes 
improved absorbent core structures, and patent 4 850 992 discloses a 
diaper construction with two fastening means. U.S. Patent 3,860,003, 
entitled "Contractable Side Portions For Disposable Diaper", issued to 
Buell on January 14, 1975, describes an elasticized leg cuff disposable 
diaper which has achieved wide acceptance and commercial success. However, absorbent articles have a tendency to sag or gap away 
from and to slide/slip down on the body of the wearer during wear. This 
sagging/gapping and sliding/slipping is caused by relative motions of the 
wearer as the wearer breathes, moves and changes positions, by the  
 
downward forces generated when the absorbent article is loaded with 
body exudates, and by the deformation of the materials of the absorbent 
article itself when subjected to such wearer's motions. This 
sagging/gapping and sliding/slipping of the absorbent article can lead to 
premature leakage and poor fit of the absorbent article about the wearer 
in the waist regions and the leg regions of the absorbent article. Thus, absorbent articles still can cause uncomfortability to the 
wearer, both by occurring leakage and by poor fit initially and during wear 
time. In order to more snugly fit absorbent articles about the waist of the 
wearer, certain commercially available absorbent articles have been 
provided with elastic waist features. An example of a disposable diaper 
with an elastic waist feature which has achieved wide acceptance and 
commercial success is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,515,595 issued to Kievit 
and Osterhage on May 7, 1985. Elastic

direction, and 
(iii) a predisposed, resilient, waistband flexural hinge zone (140) 
joining said shaping panel zone (136) and said waistline 

panel zone (138) for allowing relative flexural bending 
between said shaping panel zone (136) and said waistline 

panel zone (138) when forces are applied and for providing a 
restoring force/moment to resiliently return said 

shaping panel zone (136) and said waistline panel zone (138) to
