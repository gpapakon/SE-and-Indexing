<ABSTRACT>
A pressure-activated light emitting module (32), especially 
for an athletic shoe, includes within a body of said 

module (32) a battery and a light emitting device (54) with a 
pair of wire leads (58, 60) arranged to directly connect the 

battery to the light emitting device (54), if a pressure is 
exerted on an arm (74) extending forwardly from the upper 

surface of said body of said module (32) to overlay said battery. 
The pressure-activated module (32) may be put into the 
sole of an athletic shoe (20). Incorporated into the midsole 

portion (23) of the sole (22) of the athletic shoe (20) is a 
receptacle means (30) for releasably receiving and retaining 

said module (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure-activated 
light emitting module 
according to the preamble 
of claim 1. The present invention further relates to an athletic 
shoe according to the preamble of claim 9. There are a number of references in the patent literature 
that depict various methods for incorporating light 
emitting elements and batteries to energise them into various  
 
portions of a shoe in order, e.g., to provide a visually distinctive 
shoe. In the majority of the examples found in the 
prior art, the light emitting device, as well as the batteries, 
have been incorporated into the heel portion of the sole 
of a dress shoe. The advantage of this configuration is that 
the heel of a dress shoe generally provides sufficient volume 
to easily accommodate the electronic apparatus, and is constructed 
of a rugged, non-resilient material that protects 
the light and battery and, in a translucent version, can also 
serve as a light conductor or spreader. For example, U.S. Patents No. 4,253,253 an 3,800,133, 
British Patent No. 444,392, and Belgian Patent No. 570614, 
all illustrate women's high heel dress shoes incorporating a 
battery in the hollow interior of the heel of the shoe. Alternatively, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 1,597,823, 2,931,893, 
4,014,115, and 5,052,131, as well as European Patent publication 
No. EP-A-0 121 026, depict lighted dress and casual 
shoes incorporating a raised or block-type of heel having a 
recessed inner portion for receiving the battery. There may be several reasons for incorporating an active 
light emitting device into the shoe, e.g., to enhance 
the night safety of the wearer, to provide special visual effects 
at entertainment events, or to assist in certain biomechanical 
testing and measurements. Thus, while it is known to incorporate passive reflectors, 
including reflective tapes and the like, on the equipment 
or apparel of athletes, such as joggers or bicyclers to 
increase their visibility, and hence, safety, at night, it is 
necessary for the purely reflective elements to be illuminated 
by an external, active light source, such as the beam 
of an automobile headlight, in order for them to function. 
Footwear that incorporates its own built-in, active light 
source, and which, therefore, does not depend on an external 
source for illumination, can provide a higher level of visibility  
 
and safety than those that are purely reflective in 
nature. Further, the incorporation of active light sources into 
the shoes of participants engaged in certain
