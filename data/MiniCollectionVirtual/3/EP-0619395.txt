<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a washing control system of a washing machine 
which is provided to have a capability of carrying out the best washing, using 

accurate washing information required in washing, which comprises steps of 
reading washing information on information mediums attached on clothes and 

storing into corresponding memory, checking possibility of mixed washing with 
the stored information, displaying a condition when mixed washing is impossible 

according to the checking and storing information of total weight of fibre 
obtained from the stored washing information into a corresponding memory when 

mixed washing is possible, searching the corresponding memory for washing 
information on application of washing start signal, and carrying out washing after 

setting up required various washing conditions either according to the total 
weight of fibre and the property information stored in the washing information on 

finding stored washing information as the result of the search, or detecting the 
quantity of laundry on finding no stored washing information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a washing control system of a washing machine,
more particularly to a washing control system of a washing machine which is
provided to have a capability of carrying out the best washing, using accurate
washing information required in washing.GB-A-2 008 286 discloses a washing control system which determines the optimum setting of control members on the basis of data concerning the items to be treated. This data is inputted by means of push buttons.In general, the washing control of a washing machine is carried out by
setting washing water level and washing period of time depending on the
detected amount of laundry introduced into a washing tub.FIG. 1 is a washing control system of a washing machine including a key
pad 101 generating key signals to select a desired washing cycle such as number
of times of washing, of rinsing, and of drying, washing course, and washing
period of time to be taken according to a user's pressing of the keys, a system
control part 100 controlling overall system operation of the washing machine in
response to the key signals selected in the key pad 101, a motor operation part
102 having triac TA1 and TA2 controlling operation of a washing motor 103 by
switching on/off applied alternative current power in response to the control
signals transmitted from the system control part 100, laundry quantity sensing 
part 104 having resistances R11 and R12, diodes D11 and D12, and a photocoupler
PC1, sensing quantity of laundry inside of a washing tub and transmitting to the
system control part 100 using the residual power generated by the inertia of the
washing motor 103 after turn-off of the washing motor 103, and a display part
displaying various status of operations in response to the control signals of the
system control part 104.When a user, after introducing -laundry into the washing tub, sets up a
washing cycle by pressing washing keys on the key pad 101, the system control
part 100 reads in the key signals and initiates washing operation of the washing
machine. That is, a feed water valve(not shown) is opened to feed washing
water up to a predetermined level.When feeding of washing water has been completed, the system control part
100 switches on/off the triacs TA1 and TA2 of the motor operation part
alternatively for a certain time to detect the quantity of laundry introduced into
the washing tub. Accordingly, the washing motor 103 rotates either in clockwise
or anticlockwise direction alternatively. After a certain period of time has been
lapsed, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A washing machine control method comprising the
steps of:


a) taking washing information including weight
from media (12) attached to clothing to be washed and storing

such washing information (S3);
b) analysing the stored washing information to
determine whether all said clothing can be washed

together in a single wash (S4, S5), and generating a warning
signal when it cannot (S6);
c) in the absence of a said signal, taking from
the stored washing information details of clothing weight

and generating therefrom a total weight signal in respect
of said clothing (S8); and
d) initiating a washing programme for said
clothing according to the stored washing information and

said weight signal, the programme being initiated
according to said weight signal only in the absence of

stored washing information.
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the
washing information includes details of the respective

clothing fabrics and washing directions therefor.
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2
wherein the media (12) attached to clothing from which the

washing information is taken bears a bar code or a
magnetic recording.
A washing control device for a washing machine
comprising:


sensing means (2) for taking and storing washing
information including weight from media (12) attached to

clothing to be washed;
means (1) for analysing stored washing information and
determining whether all the clothing from which said

information has been taken can be washed together in a
single wash, and for generating and displaying a warning

signal (4) when it cannot; 
means for taking from the stored washing information
details of clothing weight and generating therefrom a

total weight signal in respect of said clothing; and
means (1) for setting a washing programme for said

clothing in the absence of a said warning signal,
according to said stored washing information and said

weight signal.
A device according to Claim 4 wherein the
sensing means is optical and includes a light source for

illuminating said media and a receiver for receiving
light reflected therefrom.
