<ABSTRACT>
A gripper strap, to move the weft feeding grippers along the shed 
of shuttleless looms, is formed in two distinct parts made of different 

materials, the end part of said strap where the gripper is mounted consisting 
of an interchangeable element, separate from the rest of the 

strap and removably connected thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerne a gripper strap, of
the type used to move the weft fooding grippers along
the shod of shuttleless looms.It is known to the skilled in the art that the drawback
present in grippor straps of looms is that the end part of
said straps, carrying the gripper, is subject to considerable
wont. In fact, tho transverse inertial forces duo to
the misaligned position of the gripper barycenter give
rise to a high-friction contact between the end part of
the strap, where the gripper is mounted, and the elements
which guide the strap along the shed on the loom
sley. On the other hand, such elements form a discontinuous
guide and develop an abrasive action on said
strap end. The mein problem is to thus limit the wear of
the strap end, so as to avoid the sure consequence of
an irregular working, after a short period of use - due to
excessive slack between the strap and the guide elements
- and, therefore, the frequent replacement of the
whole strap.An attempt has already been made to solve this
problem by interposing a wearproof element between
the end of the strap and the guide elements, that is, by
applying a stiffening and/or guiding plato or head at the
end of the strap carrying the gripper, as in BE-A-681542
or in DE-A-2400166 wherein said hoad or plate are firmly
fixed to the strap end. When adopting this principle,
the strap is formed in a single place, with a very still end
allowing to limit deformation and distribute the load.A substantially similar attempt is reported in FR-A-2270356
where a plate is fixed to the tapered end of the
strap, considerably projecting with respect to the same.However this solution is, on one hand, not suitable
for every type of loom and, on the other hand, it is not
apl to guarantee satisfactory results when the strap
guiding elements are not perfectly aligned, since a misaligned
element produces impacts and bounees of the
strap end.It should also be noted that the construction-adopted
so far - of gripper straps formed in one place with
their end part (possibly stiffened) carrying the gripper,
has the drawback of not allowing a rational cholco of the
materials used to produce either said and part, or the
remaining part of the strap: thus, for example, the technology
based on the use of a flexible composite material,
quite suitable for producing most of the gripper
strap, often does not give satisfactory results for what
concerns its end portion carrying the gripper, which portion
is subject - as seen - to severe wear in contact with
the guide

<CLAIMS>
Gripper strap to move the weft feeding grippers (8) along the shed of shuttleless looms,
formed in two distinct parts (1, 2), the end part (1) of said strap where the gripper (8) is

mounted consisting of an interchangeable element, separate and made of a different material

from the rest (2) of the strap and removably connected thereto, said end part (1) of
the strap being provided with a profiled seat (3), into which fits a profiled end section (4)

of the rest of the strap (2), said end section (4) of the strap and the seat (3) of the strap
mating one another, and said end part (1) of the strap and the rest (2) of the

strap being removably fixed to each other by means of the gripper (8) and to the gripper
itself, wherein said end/part (1) of the strap is engaged with the rest of

the strap by a free fit,
characterised in that said profiled seat (3) and said profiled end section (4) have

semicircular ends (3A and 4A, respectively), that said end part (1) is fixed to the rest
of the strap (2) by a plurality of screws (7) each crossing holes and/or corresponding notches (5,

6) formed in the two strap parts and simultaneously being screwed into threaded seats of
the gripper (8) whereby the fixing between the two freely engaged

strap parts (1, 2) is obtained by way of the gripper itself ;
and that the two strap parts (1, 2) are engaged with each other in

an area protected by the gripper.
