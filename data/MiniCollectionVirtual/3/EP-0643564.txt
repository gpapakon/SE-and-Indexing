<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a lid for a cooking pan, the main body (1) of the lid, which may be fitted with a handle (11), having essentially the shape of a truncated cone or a funnel with, at the top, a preferably central opening (12). An additional opening (16) is located in the vicinity of the bottom edge (14) of the lid and the openings (12, 16) can be opened and closed by a single actuator.

Lid, in particular a splash protection lid for a cooking vessel, of 
which the lid wall (1) possibly equipped with a handle (11) has several 

openings (12, 16) which can be closed and opened by means of a single 
operating device, characterised in that the lid wall (1) is essentially 

shaped as a truncated cone or hopper, where applicable with a slightly 
convex curved underside of the lid wall (1), and thus encloses a lid 

interior tapering slightly from bottom to top, and that the lid wall 
(1) has only one upper opening (12) at the highest point of the lid 

wall (1) and one or more lower openings (16) in the area of the lower 
lid edge (14) so that on complete or partial clearance of the openings 

(12, 16), because of a chimney effect, a forced ventilation of the 
tapered lid interior occurs in which an air flow is created through the 

lower opening (16) from outside to inside. 
Lid according to claim 1, characterised in that opening device is a 
slider (18) operated by hand. 
Lid according to claim 2, characterised in that the slider (18) has a 
slider panel (5) for closing and opening the upper opening (12). 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
operating device has a rod (19), where applicable connected with the 

slider (18), which interacts with a closing element allocated to the 
lower opening (16) for example as a ventilation flap (9) via where 

applicable a rocker bar (7) and a pull rod (8). 
Lid according to claim 4, characterised in that the ventilation flap 
(9) has a spring arm (20) which at its free end has a flap seal (10) 

for the lower opening (16) and when the operating device is moved from 
the closed position to the open position the flap seal (10) is raised 

from the opening (16) against the reset force of the spring arm (20). 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the lid 
wall (1) in the area between the upper and the lower openings (12, 16) 

is spanned by the handle (11) which in its interior, in addition to an 
operating element for the operating device such as a slider knob for 

the slider (18), holds the operating device.  
 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the slider 
(18) and where applicable the slider panel (5) is or are guided to 

slide in or on the handle (11). 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the handle 
(11) essentially has an L-shaped upper and lower handle part (2, 3) and 

that the slider panel (5) can slide in a gap (17) between two parallel 
legs (13, 15) of the upper and lower handle parts (2, 3). 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the slider 
knob (4) and where applicable the connected slider panel is or are 

arranged on the lid top to move in a plane parallel to the plane of the 
lid edge (14). 
Lid according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the lower 
lid edge (14) is bent upwards to form a channel and the lower opening 

(16) is arranged in the inner wall area of the channel (22).
