<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite seed 
material suitable for growing a layer of a metal oxide having 
a Y123 crystal thereon. One known method for the preparation of a metal 
oxide crystal having a Y123 crystal structure includes 
contacting a seed material with a molten mixture of metal 
oxides to allow the desired crystal to grow on the seed 
material. The term Y123 crystal structure" used in the 
present specification and claims is intended to refer to a 
crystal structure similar to that of YBa₂Cu₃O7-x where x is a 
number of 0-1. The term "Y123 metal oxide" is intended to 
refer to a metal oxide having a Y123 crystal structure. As the seed crystal, a magnesia single crystal, a 
Sm123 metal oxide crystal or a Y123 metal oxide crystal has 
been hitherto used. The magnesia single crystal seed, 
however, has a problem that a crystal which has grown thereon 
forms a Y123 polycrystal rather than a single Y123 crystal. 
The Y123 crystal seed, on the other hand, poses a problem 
that the molten mixture climbs along the seed crystal so that 
a holder thereof will be wetted and reacted with the molten 
mixture. It is, therefore, an object of the present 
invention to provide a seed material which is suitable for 
forming a Y123 single crystal thereon. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a seed material of the above-mentioned type which can 
prevent a molten metal oxide mixture, with which the seed 
material is contacted for the growth of the Y123 crystal, 
from climbing along the seed crystal. In accomplishing the foregoing objects, there is 
provided in accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention a composite material comprising a substrate, and an 
oriented film provided on a surface of said substrate and 
formed of a metal oxide which has a crystal structure of a  
 
Y123 metal oxide and which has the formula: 
LnBa₂Cu₃Oywherein Ln stands for Y or an element belonging to the 
lanthanoid and y is a number of 6-7. Other objects, features and advantages of the 
present invention will become apparent from the detailed 
description of the preferred embodiments of the invention 
which follows, when considered in light of the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a composite 
seed material according to the present invention used for 
growing a Y123 metal oxide crystal thereon; Fig. 2 is an X-ray diffraction pattern of a metal 
oxide layer of the composite seed material obtained in 
Example 1 according to the present invention; and Fig. 3 is a
