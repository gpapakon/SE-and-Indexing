<ABSTRACT>
Reliable data protection in the case of dynamic memory management.  e w values of current data are prepared from a change and a check sum is determined. During the change, a second signal (PI), which would stop the change, is suppressed. After the change, the second signal (PI) is permitted again.

<CLAIMS>
A method of protecting data in the case of dynamic
memory management by means of a processor wherein a first

signal (PF) indicating an imminent loss of data can occur
and as a result of the first signal a second signal (PI) is

triggered which serves to interrupt the processor in a
current processing or modification of data, comprising the

following steps:

in a first program status which occurs prior to a
modification of current data, new values of the

current data are prepared and a check sum is
calculated;
in a second program status which occurs during the
modification of the current data the second signal

(PI) is suppressed and
following the modification of the current data the
second signal (PI) is released again.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the new values
of the current data are subdivided into data packets of a

defined size which is not to be exceeded and the
modification of the current data takes place data-packet-wise,

and wherein a status register is maintained.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein at the start of
the modification of the current data this is indicated by

means of a marker.
The use of the method according to one of the
preceding claims for speech storage with pool memory

management.
