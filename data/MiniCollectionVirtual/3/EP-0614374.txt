<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein was made in the course of work under grant Nos. PO1-AI-26886, RO-1-AI-14969, RO-1-CA-55713 and Immunology Training Grant AI-07132 from the National Institutes of Health. The United States government therefore has certain rights in this invention.Throughout this application, various publications are referenced by the last name of the authors, followed by the year of publication within parenthesis. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification, immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more full describe the state of the art as known skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.In a contact-dependent process termed "T cell helper function," CD4+ T lymphocytes direct the activation and differentiation of B lymphocytes and thereby regulate the humoral immune response by modulating the specificity, secretion and isotype-encoded functions of antibody molecules (Mitchell, et al., 1968; Michison, 1971; White, et al., 1978; Reinherz, et al. 1979; Janeway, et al. 1988; O'Brien, et al., 1988; Rahemtulla, et al., 1991; and Grusby, et al., 1991). The T cell surface molecules that mediate the contact-dependent elements of T cell helper function are not yet fully known (Noelle, et al., 1991).The process by which T cells help B cells to differentiate has been divided into two distinct phases: the inductive and effector phases (Vitetta, et al., 1989; Noelle, et al., 1990). In the inductive phase, resting T cells contact antigen-primed B cells and this association allows clonotypic T cell receptor (TCR)-CD4 complexes to interact with Ia/Ag complexes on B cells (Janeway, et al., 1988; Katz, et al., 1973; Zinkernagel, 1976; Sprent, 1978a; Sprent, 1978b; Jones, et al., 1981; Julius, et al., 1982; Chestnut, et al., 1981; Rogozinski, et al., 1984). TCR/CD4 recognition of Ia/Ag results in the formation of stable T-B cognate pairs and bidirectional T and B cell activation (Sanders, et al., 1986; Snow, et al., 1983; Krusemeier, et al., 1988; Noelle, et al., 1989; Bartlett, et al., 1989; Kupfer, et al., 1987). In the effector phase, activated T cells drive B cell differentiation by secreting lymphokines (Noelle, et al., 1983; Thompson, et al., 1985) and by contact-dependent stimuli (Noelle, et al., 1989; Clement, et al., 1984; Crow, et al., 1986; Brian, 1988; Hirohata, et al., 1988; Jover, et al., 1989; Whalen, et al., 1988; Pollok,
