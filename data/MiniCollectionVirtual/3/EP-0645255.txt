<ABSTRACT>
A method for mounting a thermal printing module (1) which has a holding arm (2) to which a thermal print head (5) is adjustably attached, the thermal print head (5) being adjusted in an adjustment plane lying tangentially to the back pressure roller (15) and having the same contact line with the back pressure roller (15) as the underside of the thermal print head until all the heating elements (10) come into contact with the outer surface of the back pressure roller (15). In order to simplify the assembly and adjustment of a thermal printing module and make this less expensive, at least two point-type temperature sensors (11a, 11b, 11c), each having a temperature display (12a, 12b, 12c), and the holding arm (2) are arranged in a separate mounting device (16, 17, 18) instead of the back pressure roller (15) so as to be pivotable on an axle (19) in such a way that the paths limited by the temperature sensors (11a, 11b, 11c) assume the same position relative to the axle (19) as a bearing axle arranged in the thermal printer for the thermal printing module (1) relative to the contact line on the outer surface of the back pressure roller (15) of the thermal printer. Subsequently, the thermal print head (5) is displaced in a plane corresponding to the adjustment plane in the thermal printer until the temperature displays (12a, 12b, 12c) display identical temperature values.
