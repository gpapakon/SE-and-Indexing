<ABSTRACT>
The construction according to the invention is produced from prefabricated elements (A, B) stacked, dry, in superposed rows and each including two end faces (1) provided with a recess (2), two longitudinal faces (5, 6), cavities (7) and cells (alveoles) (8) respectively adjacent to the longitudinal faces. It is characterised in that the cells (8) each include a transverse section (8a) extending between two adjacent cavities (7), the transverse sections (8a) emerging on the upper (3) and lower (4) faces and having a cross-section approximately equal to that of a conduit (9) delimited by the recesses (2) of two adjacent elements (A,B) of the same row, in that the conduits (9) are each located in the prolongation of one of the transverse sections (8a) of the cells (8) of one element of the adjacent row and in that a binder is poured (cast) into the conduits (9) and the cells (8).

Prefabricated construction element comprising two end
faces (1) each provided with a recess (2), an upper

face (3), a lower face (4), and two longitudinal faces
(5, 6) between which are located cavities (7) separated

by cells (8) opening onto the upper (3) and lower (4)
faces, characterised in that the cells (8) have a T-shaped

cross-section and each comprise a longitudinal
section adjacent to one (6) of the longitudinal faces

of the construction element and a transverse section
(8a) extending between two cavities (7), opening onto

the upper (3) and lower (4) faces and having a cross-section
which is approximately equal to that of a

conduit (9) delimited by the recesses (2) of two
adjacent elements (A, B) in the same row, and in that

the cavities (7) extend between the other longitudinal
face (5) of the construction element and the

longitudinal sections of the cells (8).
Construction element according to claim 1,

characterised in that it comprises two cells (8) the
transverse sections (8a) 
of which are equidistant from
the end faces (1) and three cavities (7) located one

between the transverse sections (8a) and the two others
between a transverse section (8a) and the end face (1)

adjacent to the said section.
Construction element according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that it comprises an intermediate wall
(11) dividing each of the transverse sections (8a) of

the cells (8) into two parts and extending between the
upper (3) and lower (4) faces, as well as an end

protuberance (12) projecting above the bottom of each
of the recesses (2), parallel to the longitudinal faces

(5, 6), the said protuberances lying in the
prolongation of one another and having a height equal

to the depth of the corresponding recesses. 
Construction element according to claim 3,

characterised in that the intermediate walls (11)
located in the transverse sections (8a) of the cells

(8) lie in the prolongation of the end protuberances
(12) located in the recesses (2).
