<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a unit integrated system wherein a hydraulic unit (1) having 
an upper surface (3a) defining an oil inlet and an electronic control unit (2) for 

controlling the drive of the hydraulic unit (1) are integrated together in juxtaposition 
with each other in such a manner that an upper surface (2a) of the electronic 

control unit is located at a position equal to or lower than the upper surface (3a) of 
the hydraulic unit (1), whereby an operating space (35) of a piping tool is insured 

above the electronic control unit (2) in connecting a hydraulic pipe (34) to the oil 
inlet in the upper surface (3a) of the hydraulic unit (1), and the hydraulic pipe (34) 

is securely connected to the oil inlet of the hydraulic unit (1) by using the existing 
spanner-shaped piping tool without interference of the tool with an upper portion 

of the electronic control unit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a unit integrated system
including an electronic control unit and a hydraulic unit which are formed integrally
and to a connector for a vehicle-mounted system such as an ABS (antilock brake
system), a TCS (traction control system) and the like.One of the systems for enhancing the safety of automotive vehicles is an ABS
for preventing wheel lock when the brakes are applied suddenly or on a slippery
road. In general, conventional ABSs have been constructed such that a hydraulic
unit is disposed in the engine room and an electronic control unit is disposed in the
cabin, for example, under seats or within front panels.However, separate provision of the hydraulic unit in the engine room and the
electronic control unit in the cabin requires wiring harnesses extending from the
engine room to the cabin for electrical connection between the hydraulic unit and
the electronic control unit, resulting in elongated wiring harnesses and complicated
operation of laying the harnesses.Recently, it has been proposed to provide the electronic control unit and
hydraulic unit which are integrated together in the engine room for reduction in
length of the wiring harnesses and simplification of the laying operation of the
harnesses in an assembly line. Such an integrated system is disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Application No. 3-177132 (1991).In the above-mentioned system in which the hydraulic unit and the electronic
control unit are integrated, mere combination of the two units causes difficulty in
pouring oil into the hydraulic unit, depending upon size and positions of the two
units.Typically, oil is poured into the hydraulic unit through a hydraulic pipe
connected to an oil inlet provided on an upper surface of the hydraulic unit. As
shown in Fig. 19, for system size reduction, an electronic control unit 102 is
assembled to the hydraulic unit 101 having the oil inlet on its upper surface in
juxtaposition with each other. In the assembling, if an upper surface 102a of the
electronic control unit 102 is higher than an upper surface 103a of the hydraulic
unit 101, since connection of a hydraulic pipe 134 to the oil inlet of the hydraulic
unit 101 with an existing spanner-shaped piping tool (not shown) necessitates a
space enclosed by broken lines 135 of Fig. 19 for operation of the tool, the piping
tool interferes with an upper part 102b of the electronic control unit 102 extending
upwardly above the upper surface 103a of the hydraulic unit 101, resulting in
impr
