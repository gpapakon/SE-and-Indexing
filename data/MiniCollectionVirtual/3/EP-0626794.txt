<ABSTRACT>
The nonlinear, deflection waveform used improve
registration in a three picture tube projection television

system is produced using interpolation of stored data
setting points by first performing a reduced number of high-order

interpolation calculations using the setting points
and then performing low-order interpolation calculations

either between two calculated high-order interpolated data
points or between one of the calculated high-order

interpolated data points and one of the setting points.
This results in reducing the work load on the central

processing unit in the registration system. In addition, a
reduced bit-size requirement for the interpolation portion

of the registration is obtained by storing registration data
of a first bit size and then adding bits below the original

LSB for the interpolation calculation prior to performing
the digital to analog conversion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
method and apparatus for performing a registration
adjustment for correcting picture distortion and colour
shifts occurring in a projection television and, more
particularly, to an interpolation method for improving the
registration adjustment process.Recently, various types of projection television
sets for displaying a picture on a large size screen with
high precision have been practically utilized.Figs. 5A and 5B of the accompanying drawings
schematically show a structure of this sort of projection
television 1, in which SC indicates a screen on which a
picture or image is projected. Individual light projecting
units that project each of a red component (R), a green
component (G), and a blue component (B) of the primary
colour picture are provided on the rear side of this screen
SC, which constitutes a so-called rear projection television
combined with a screen.The light projecting unit includes cathode ray
tubes (CRTs) for producing the respective primary picture
light, deflection yokes DY for deflecting electron beams of
these CRTs, and focusing lenses CD for focusing the primary
colour picture light formed by the CRTs onto the screen SC.
The respective primary colour picture light irradiated from
the light projecting unit is projected via a rear-mounted
reflection mirror to the screen SC. The screen can be a
lenticular screen constructed as a Fresnel lens, for
example. It should be noted that when the reflection mirror
M is not employed, such as in the structure shown in Fig. 6,
the respective primary colour picture light is directly
projected from the rear side of the screen SC. As is apparent from the structures shown in Figs.
5A, 5B, 6, an optical system is so constructed in the rear
projection television 1 with such a structure that the
picture light is obliquely projected to the screen SC. In
other words, since the optical system is asymmetrically
arranged with respect to the screen in the rear projection
television 1, the picture light projected from the CRTs must
be previously distorted in such a manner that the distortion
components caused by this asymmetrical arrangement are
cancelled in order to project proper pictures without
distortion.Distortion of the projected picture image for
cancelling asymmetry in the optical system will be referred
to as registration correction. A circuit for performing
this registration correction is employed in the rear
projection television 1 having the above-described
structure, and the structure of the rear
