<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns semiconductor devices, and more
specifically relates to a configuration and peripheral structure of a
temperature monitoring element for monitoring the temperature of a power
IC device.Nowadays, a power MOSFET that is easily driven is widely used for
controlling electric power. As a result of the progress and improvement
in manufacturing process technology, power IC devices which mount the
power MOSFET on a chip together with a control circuit for controlling the
power MOSFET have been put into the market. Because a power block and the
control circuit adjoin each other in the power IC device, a protective
circuit for protecting the control circuit against excessive temperature
rises of the power block should be provided since an excessive temperature
rise can cause malfunction and breakdown of the control circuit. To
achieve such protection, a temperature monitoring element that feeds
temperature information of the power block to the protective circuit is
mounted as a temperature sensor on the chip.Figures 4a and 4b explain a configuration and peripheral
structure of a temperature monitoring element in the power IC device
according to the prior art, as seen in EP-A-224 274 (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1).Figure 4a is a top plan view showing an entire planar chip
configuration of the power IC device. In Figure 4a, a temperature
monitoring element 8 is arranged in a control circuit block 2 adjacent a
boundary between a power block (power MOSFET block) 1 and the control
circuit block (IC block) 2.Figure 4b is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of Figure
4a, and shows an expanded view of the boundary portion between the power
MOSFET block 1 and the IC block 2. In Figure 4b, reference numeral 4
designates a back gate region layer (channel region) of an end portion of
the power MOSFET block formed on a silicon substrate 33. A source region
layer 5 is formed in the back gate region layer 4 and electrode wiring 7
(source electrode) is connected to the source region layer 5 and the back
gate region layer 4. A temperature monitoring element 8 is covered by an 
insulating layer 9 and insulated from the other layers. The temperature
monitoring element 8 is positioned in the IC block 2 adjoining to the
power MOSFET block 1 so as to facilitate detecting the temperature of the
power MOSFET block 1. The electrode wiring 7 does not extend over the
temperature monitoring element 8. In Figure 4, the illustrated power
MOSFET block 1 is formed as a vertical MOS, but the power
