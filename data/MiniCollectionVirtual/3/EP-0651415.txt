<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-frequency power switch having at least one reed contact (1), which is fused in a glass bulb, and having at least one electrically screened control coil (3-5), the reed contact being at high-voltage potential and the control coil being at earth potential. The control coil is at the same time operatively connected to the reed contact. In order to increase the dielectric strength of such a switch further, with a design which is as simple as possible, the invention proposes that the control coil be arranged at a distance laterally alongside the reed contact.

<CLAIMS>
High-frequency circuitbreaker comprising at least one reed contact (1 - 2) sealed in
a glass bulb and at least one electrically screened control coil (3 - 5), wherein the at least

one reed contact (1 - 2) lies at high-voltage potential and the at least one control coil (3 - 5)
lies at reference potential, especially ground, and wherein the at least one control coil (3 -

5) stands in operative connection with the at least one reed contact (1 - 2) respectively
associated therewith, and wherein the at least one control coil (3 - 5) is arranged at a

spacing adjacent to the at least one reed contact (1 - 2) associated therewith and is
provided with pole pieces (4), characterised thereby that the control coil (3 - 5) is encased

by a metallic foil (6), preferably a foil of copper, for the electrical screening and that the
control coil (3 - 5) provided with pole pieces (4) is surrounded by a housing, which is

preferably made of aluminium, with rounded corners and edges.
High-frequency circuitbreaker according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the
control coil (3 - 5) comprises a soft iron core or a permanent magnet as coil core (3).
High-frequency circuitbreaker according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised thereby that the control coil (3 - 5) is fastened preferably by its pole pieces

(4) to a plate (7), preferably to a metallic plate, especially to a plate of aluminium.
High-frequency circuitbreaker according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised thereby that the reed contact (1 - 2) is provided at each of its two ends with

a soldered connection (2) resistant to high voltage.
