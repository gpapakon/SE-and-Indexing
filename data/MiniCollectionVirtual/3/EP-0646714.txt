<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metal flat gasket (seal) for two components to be clamped together at their abutting surfaces by means of bolts, especially components of an internal combustion engine, with a flat gasket part (1) which comprises a metal sheet, has a shape corresponding to the abutting surfaces to be sealed off and provided with holes (3) for the bolts, and is provided with at least one aperture region (2) and a bead (4) preferably surrounding the aperture region (2). In order to be able to seal off T locations, the flat-gasket part (1) is elastomer-coated and is coated in such a way in the region of T locations to be sealed off, preferably in pockets, with a plastically deformable sealing material (5) that, during assembly, the sealing material (5) is pressed into the adjoining regions of the flat gasket part (1).

<CLAIMS>
Flat metal gasket for two parts, in particular of an internal 
combustion engine, to be clamped one against the other at their 

abutment surfaces by means of screw-bolts, with a flat gasket 
part (1) consisting of a metal sheet, which has a shape 

corresponding to the abutment surfaces to be sealed and provided 
with holes (3) for the screw-bolts and is provided with at least 

one opening region (2) as well as a reinforcing seam (4) 
preferably surrounding the opening region (2), characterised in 

that the flat gasket part (1) is surface-coated and in the region 
of the T-points to be sealed is coated preferably in pockets 

with a sealing material (5) capable of plastic deformation so 
that at the time of assembly the sealing material (5) is pushed 

into the adjoining region of the flat gasket part (1). 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the sealing material (5) capable of plastic deformation is 

silicone. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the sealing material (5) capable of plastic deformation is 

received by a pocket (6). 
Flat metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the reinforcing seam (4) extends towards 

the medium to be sealed on the inside of the holes (3) for the 
screw-bolts. 
Flat metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that at least one hole (3) is provided with a 

collar (12) able to be inserted in a bore for a screw-bolt. 
Flat metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that located on the outside are mounting straps 

(13) for fixing the gasket on one of the parts to be clamped.  
 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the mounting straps (13) are located adjacent to the holes (3) 

with the collar (12). 
Flat metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the flat gasket part (1) consists of steel, 

in particular spring steel. 
Flat metal gasket according to one of Claims 1 to 8, for 
location between the abutment surfaces of an engine block and oil 

sump of an internal combustion engine, on at least one end face 
a circular passage, which extends respectively half way across 

the oil sump and the engine block, for a part to be inserted and 
on the oil sump side a semi-circular receiving groove being 

provided and the oil sump and the engine block being able to be 
connected to each other by way of screw-bolts extending through 

corresponding bores opening out on the abutment surfaces and an 

elastomer gasket section (11) being provided for insertion in at 
least one receving groove of the passage of the oil sump, 

characterised in that the flat gasket part (1) comprisies two 
legs (8), which adjacent to the passage respectively comprise a 

tongue (10), to which the elastomer gasket section (11) is 
attached. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the legs (8) are additionally connected to each other by a 

central section provided with a reinforcing seam (6) and having 
a shape corresponding to a semi-circular flange, adjacent to the 

passage. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 9 or 10, characterised 
in that the elastomer gasket section (11) is connected to the 

tongues (10) in a form-locking and/or force-locking manner. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 11, characterised in  
 

that the elastomer gasket section (11) is connected to the 
tongues (10) by sticking. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised 
in that the elastomer gasket section (11) is connected to the 

tongues (10) by tying. 
Flat metal gasket according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised 
in that the elastomer gasket section (11) is connected to the 

tongues (10) by vulcanisation.
