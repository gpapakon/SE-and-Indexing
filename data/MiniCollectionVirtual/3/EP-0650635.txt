<ABSTRACT>
A method for the fabrication of multipole magnets, which method comprises the steps of (i) screen or stencil printing an ink comprising a mixture of particles of a magnet material and a carrier material onto a backing sheet in a predetermined pattern; (ii) curing or drying the patterned sheet and magnetising the areas forming the predetermined pattern in step (i) using a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the backing sheet to produce North poles on one side of the sheet and South poles on the other side of the sheet; (iii) screen or stencil printing an ink comprising a mixture of a magnet material and a carrier material onto a backing sheet in a pattern which is complementary to the pattern in step (i), the ink being printed in those areas where no ink was printed in step (i); (iv) curing or drying the patterned sheet and magnetising the areas forming the complementary pattern in step (iii) using a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the backing sheet to produce North poles on one side of the sheet and South poles on the other side of the sheet; (v) turning over the sheet from step (iv); and (vi) bringing the sheet from step (ii) and the reversed sheet from step (v) together form a laminate, thereby forming a multiple magnet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
fabrication of multipole magnets and, in particular, 
to a method for the fabrication of multipole magnets 
comprising a crystalline phase of an alloy of Fe, B 
and R, where R is a rare earth element. Magnetic materials and permanent magnets are 
important materials which are used in many 
applications, including electrical appliances and 
electronic devices. In view of the increasing 
requirement for miniaturization and the greater 
demands placed on electrical appliances and 
electronic devices there has been an increasing 
demand for improved magnetic materials and permanent 
magnets. EP-A-0101552 describes magnetic materials based 
on alloys of the type Fe-B-R containing at least one 
stable compound of the ternary Fe-B-R type, where R 
is a rare earth element including yttrium, which 
compound can be magnetised to become a permanent 
magnet. The amount of rare earth R is generally in 
the range of from 8 to 30 atomic percent. EP-A-0108474 describes a magnetically hard alloy 
composition comprising at least 10 atomic percent of 
one or more rare earth elements, 0.5 to 10 atomic 
percent of boron; and iron or mixtures of iron with a 
transition metal element, the alloy containing a 
major portion of magnetically hard, fine crystallites 
having an average diameter of less than 400 
nanometres. JP-A-61- 100 910 discloses a method of making a 
permanent magnet with the features of i) and ii) 
of claim 1. With the development of the rare-earth magnets, 
one of the major benefits is the high coercivity, or 
resistance to demagnetisation. This means that a 
high applied magnetic field is required before any  
 
permanent damage to the magnet can occur. This is 
particularly relevant to magnets which are very thin 
(in the direction of magnetism), and already have a 
significant internally generated demagnetising field 
due to the aspect ratio. Many applications now 
demand (or would benefit from) magnetic components 
that are very thin, due to constraints of size and 
weight, and can only be addressed by utilising the 
high coercivity of these types of magnet. Problems arise in respect of the magnetisation of 
these materials as their inherently high magnetic 
stability means that very high external fields must 
be applied to achieve a high percentage of the 
available magnetic strength (saturation). For 
isotropic materials such as certain melt spun NdFeB 
alloys the situation is even worse because the 
magnetisation process is attempting to magnetise the

A method for the fabrication of multipole 
magnets, which method comprises the steps of 


i) screen or stencil printing an ink comprising 
a mixture of particles of a magnet material and a 

carrier material onto a backing sheet in a 
predetermined pattern; 
ii) curing or drying the patterned sheet and 
magnetising the areas forming the predetermined 

pattern in step (i) using a magnetic field 
perpendicular to the plane of the backing sheet to 

produce North poles on one side of the sheet and 
South poles on the other side of the sheet; 
iii) screen or stencil printing an ink comprising 
a mixture of a magnet material and a carrier material 

onto a backing sheet in a pattern which is 
complementary to the pattern in step (i), the ink 

being printed in those areas where no ink was printed 
in step (i) 
iv) curing or drying the patterned sheet and 
magnetising the areas forming the complementary 

pattern in step (iii) using a magnetic field 
perpendicular to the plane of the backing sheet to 

produce North poles on one side of the sheet and 
South poles on the other side of the sheet; 
v) turning over the sheet from step (iv); and 
vi) bringing the sheet from step (ii) and the 
reversed sheet from step (v) together form a 

laminate, thereby forming a multipole magnet.
