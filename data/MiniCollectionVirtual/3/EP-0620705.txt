<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to harvesting vinous row crops,
particularly tomatoes.Botanists and agronomists are continuously developing
new and improved varieties of tomatoes for commercial
processing. Typically botanists and agronomists seek to
develop tomatoes providing higher yield per unit area of
growing space; that is, more tomatoes of greater weight per
vine or per given space in the field. Additionally,
botanists seek to develop tomato varieties having improved
resistance to wilt and other funguses, improved resistance
to drought and to excessively wet conditions, improved
resistance to disease and to insect infestation and in
which a high percentage of the fruit ripens at the same
time.Unfortunately, while botanists have developed tomato
varieties for commercial canning purposes having the
aforementioned improved characteristics, these newly
developed tomato varieties demonstrate strong adherence of
the ripe fruit to the tomato vines, making the ripe fruit
difficult to harvest mechanically. This is especially
true if the growing season has been dry. Currently many of
the most popular commercially grown tomatoes, including
many tomato varieties which are specified by commercial
canneries and food processors (farmers growing tomatoes
under contract for such canneries and food processors must
grow the specified variety) are varieties which exhibit
substantial and effective strength where the ripe fruit
attaches to the tomato vine. These varieties of tomatoes
are appropriately called "hard to shake varieties" in the
trade and include popular commercial varieties whose seeds
are identified as "7151 Heinz" and "1810 Heinz" specified
by H.J. Heinz Foods, Inc., as "8245 Ohio Seed" developed by 
Ohio State University, as "U.S. Seed 68" developed by the
United States Department of Agriculture, as "UC 82 B"
developed by the University of California and as "696",
"1596" and "2196" all developed by and available for Peto
Seed Co., Inc., in Santicoy, California.Current commercially available tomato harvesting
equipment, when used to harvest these "hard to shake"
tomato varieties, customarily leaves from about 3 to about
5 percent by weight of the fruit of these varieties on the
tomato vines, when operating under conditions typically
encountered in the northeast, southeast and mid-west
sections of the United States.Typically, mechanical tomato harvesting, chain-type
conveyers have been used to convey a tomato vine mass,
either before or after the tomatoes have been shaken from
the vine mass. Unfortunately,

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for harvesting vinous row crops, said apparatus comprising
means (46) for cutting a crop-carrying vine mass (10) of said crop from its

growing roots;

means (48), receiving said vine mass from said cutting means (46), for imparting
vibratory motion to said vine mass (10) to break said crop from vines

of said vine mass, including a rotatable shaker (22), means for drivingly rotating
said shaker and imparting vibratory motion thereto during rotation

thereof, and means (20) extending from said shaker for freely substantially
engaging said vine mass and vibratingly carrying said vine mass (10), and

means (24), below said means (48) for imparting vibratory motion to said
vine mass, for catching and conveying said crop broken from said vines

away from said vine mass,

characterized in that
a carrying path followed by said mean (20) extending from said shaker is such
that the vine mass is carried over said shaker along an arcuate path, which

is first directed upwardly over said shaker, in a vertical plane orthogonal to
the longitudinal axis of said shaker as the shaker vibratingly rotates, to a

vine mass discharge position where said arcuate path is downwardly directed.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said means (24) below said means
(48) for imparting vibratory motion to said vine mass, for catching and conveying

said crop broken from said vines away from said vine mass comprises:

i. a second rotatable shaker (32) in addition to said aforementioned
shaker;
ii. means for drivingly rotating said second shaker (32) including means
(84) for imparting vibratory motion to said second shaker during rotation

thereof; 
iii. means (38) extending from said second shaker for engaging said remaining
vine mass portion received from said catching and conveying

means (24), thereby carrying said remaining vine mass over said second
shaker (32) as said second shaker (32) rotates;

said crop catching and conveying means (24) extending under said means
(32) for imparting vibratory motion to said second shaker for catching and

conveying said crop which had been broken from said vines but entrapped
within said vine mass to a crop discharge position
Apparatus of claim 1, wherein said rotatable shaker (22) comprises a first
cylindrical shaker head rotatable about a substantially horizontal axis; said

means for drivingly rotating said shaker (22) comprises means for drivingly
rotating said first shaker head about said axis including means for imparting

vibratory motion to said first shaker head during rotation thereof; and said
means (20) extending from said shaker (22) for freely engaging said vine

mass comprises a plurality of tines protruding outwardly from the curved
periphery of said first shaker head in a direction skew to radial to liftingly

engage said vine mass (10) as tips of said tines travel in a generally upward
direction, thereby lifting and carrying said vine mass over the first shaker

head in a generally arcuate path;

said means (24), positioned below said means (48) for imparting vibratory
motion to said vine mass, for catching and conveying said crop broken from

said vines of said vine mass conveys to a said crop discharge position and
conveys the vine mass portion remaining upon disengagement from said

tines of said first shaker head to a position for engaging a second means
(84) in addition to said aforementioned means for imparting vibratory

movement to said vine mass, for imparting vibratory motion to said vine
mass remaining portion to free said crop entrapped therein;

characterized by said second means imparting vibratory motion to said vine
mass remaining portion including a second cylindrical shaker head (32) rotatable

about a substantially horizontal axis;
means for drivingly rotating said second shaker head about said axis including 
said second means (84) for imparting vibratory motion to said second

shaker head during rotation thereof; and a
plurality of tines (30) protruding outwardly from the curved periphery of said
second shaker head in a direction skew to the radial direction to engage

said remaining vine mass portion received from said conveying means as
tips of said tines travel in a generally upward direction, thereby carrying said

vine mass over said second shaker head;
said crop catching and conveying means (34) extending under said second
vibratory motion imparting means (84) for catching and conveying said crop

which had been broken from said vines but entrapped within said vine mass
to said crop discharge position.
Apparatus of claim 3 wherein said tines (20) of said first shaker head (22)
are positioned such that when the point of intersection of said tine and said

first shaker head is on a horizontal axis, the extremity of the tine remote
from the first shaker head is displaced from said horizontal axis in a direction

to be the portion of said tine to first encounter said vine mass as said
first shaker head rotates.
Apparatus of claim 4 further comprising means (12) for upwardly conveying
said vine mass (10) from said cutting means to said means (48) for imparting

vibratory motion to said vine mass, delivering said vine mass to said
means for imparting vibratory motion to said vine mass at a position above
