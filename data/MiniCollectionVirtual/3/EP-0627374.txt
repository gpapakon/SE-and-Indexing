<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for transporting a considerable number of board blanks (1) - standing on
one of their edges (2) - to a blank removal station, with at least one driven rotary

shaft (3, 4), the surface (13) of which is provided with thread-like recesses and
projections, and with at least one shaft that has a smooth surface, 
wherein
 the
smooth roller (14) is also driven, 
wherein
 all the shafts (3, 4, 14) support the board
blanks (1) directly and 
wherein
 at least one limit switch (7, 8) is provided at the
end of the transport apparatus that switches the shaft drive (9, 10) off when a

specified pressure level is applied by a board blank and switches the shaft drive
back on again when the pressure drops below the specified level.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the shafts (3, 4, 14) are supported in such
a way that the height of them can be adjusted at least to some extent in order to

adapt them to the shape of the board blanks in each case.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 at least some of the shafts (3, 4, 14)

are provided with separate drives (9, 10). 
Apparatus according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 the limit switch (7, 8)
is provided with a free-swinging switching arm (5, 6) that is provided with a weight

(12) at its lower end.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 the limit switch (7, 8) is
provided with a movably supported switching arm (5, 6) that is spring-loaded and

the board blanks (1) that are being transported press against this spring load.
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, 
wherein
 two limit switches (7, 8) are provided
next to each other that are connected to the drives (9, 10) of two parallel shafts (3,

4) with a thread-like surface (13).
