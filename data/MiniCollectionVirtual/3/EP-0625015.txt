<ABSTRACT>
In a shoe (2) with a central closure (1), the central closure (1) is provided with two tightening elements (10, 11) that can be adjusted independently of each other or both together, in order to close different closing areas of the shoe. It is thus possible to tighten or retighten an area of the shoe (2) when another area of the shoe (2) is already sufficiently tightened.

Footwear, especially footwear for sport, leisure or rehabilitation,
 
   having a central closure (1) with two tension devices (10, 11) arranged 

coaxially one above the other, as well as having clamp and/or catch 
means by which the set positions of the two tension devices (10, 11) may 

independently of one another be fixed and loosened again or a clamping 
action overcome, the tension devices (10, 11) being adjustable and/or 

made non-catching at option independently of one another or together, and 
each tension device (10, 11) being coupled to a cordlike tension element 

(9, 8) which may be shortened or lengthened depending upon the direction 
of actuation of the tension devices (10, 11) and respectively is either 

led over deflector elements (19) provided on the upper of the footwear 
and if necessary also on an instep covering (5), back to the central 

closure (1) and/or at least one tension element (8 or 9) is fastened 
especially at the ends, to the upper (4, 16) or the instep covering (5), 

characterized in that
 
the tension devices (10, 11) exhibit at their adjoining sides or faces 

respective toothed rings (30, 31) directed towards one another, which are 
alike but opposed to one another and have teeth with steep flanks (32 or 

33) at one side and shallow tooth flanks (34 or 35) at the other, that 
at least one of the two tension devices (11) is arranged to be axially 

shiftable and by means of one spring or a number of springs may be 
pressed against the other tension device (10) and the axial stroke (40) 

is measured by the two toothed rings (30, 31) having to be brought out of 
engagement with one another so that upon moving the one tension device 

(10) in the closing direction the two tension devices (10, 11) may be 
coupled rigidly together by the toothed rings (30, 31) and the other 

tension device (11) may be moved at the same time, and upon moving the 
first tension device (10) in the opening direction the second tension 

device (11) remains fixed in its position and thus the shallow tooth 
flanks (34, 35) resting against one another slide over one another, 

whereby the two tension devices (10, 11) may be brought so far apart that 
the toothed rinds (30, 31) come out of engagement with one another and 

the tips (47, 48) of the teeth of the one toothed ring (30 or 31) can 
jump over those of the other toothed ring (31 or 30 respectively). 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   the two tension devices (10, 11) are made as pulleys.  

 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   upon actuation of the first tension device (10) in the closing direction 

it is coupled frictionally with the second tension device (11) so 
that the second tension device (11) is movable in the closing direction 

but against the closing direction may be fixed by clamping or catching, 
and that the first tension device (10) is also movable back in the opening 

direction against or with at least partial neutralization of its 
associated clamp and/or catch means (28) and in doing so the frictional 

locking between the two tension devices (10, 11) may be loosened and the 
first tension device (10) moved back with respect to the second tension 

device (11) and upon subsequent movement in the closing direction may be 
coupled again frictionally with the second tension device (11) so that 

both tension devices (10, 11) may again be moved together in the closing 
direction and fixed in the new set position by clamping or catching. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
 
   the clamping or catching action of the two tension devices (10, 11) 

may he loosened or overcome both independently of one another and - 
especially for the purpose of rapid opening of the central closure - 

together or simultaneously, so that at least the first tension device 
driving the second tension device (11) or both tension devices (10, 11) 

simultaneously may be actuated in the opening direction. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
 
   at least that other tension device (11) which is movable by the one 

tension device (10) along with it in the closing direction, exhibits a 
second toothed ring (37), especially one standing out radially and having 

a set of teeth which are directed and act like the teeth of its first 
toothed ring (31) and into which engage springily deflectable pawls 

arranged fixed to one wall (23) of the housing. 
Footwear as in Claim 5, characterized in that
 
   the tension device (11) provided with a second toothed ring (37) may 

be shifted axially in such a way that the associated pawls (38) can no 
longer engage in the set of teeth. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 2 to 6, characterized in that
 
   on the circumferential face (41) of each of the tension devices (10, 

ces (10, 11) a groove (42 resp. 43) is provided for guiding a cord.  
 
Footwear as in Claim 7, characterized in that
 
   each tension device (10, 11) formed as a disc exhibits one or two 

drilled holes (45) offset from the centre (44) to the side, which open 
into the cord guidance groove (42 or 43) and into which a tension element 

(8 or 9) may be introduced and clamped, especially by deformation of 
the wall (46) of the drilled hole. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 6 to 8, characterized in that
 
   the pawls (38) are cut free of a wall (23) of the housing of the 

central closure (1), which consists of springily elastic material. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
 
   by the driving tension device (10) firmly connected to the tension 

element (9) which closes the footwear across the instep (5), the other 
tension device (11) may be moved at the same time and the latter tension 

device (11) is firmly connected to a tension element (8) which closes the 
upper (4, 16) of the footwear in the region of the ankle and/or above the 

ankle and has a longer closing travel compared with the other tension 
element (9) which closes the upper across the instep (5). 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
 
   the driving tension device (10) is coupled or may be coupled with a 

gear and driven via this gear. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 11, characterized in that
 
   both the tension devices (10, 11) may be released and/or disengaged 

from the closed state simultaneously by a single actuator (25a). 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that
 
   the central closure (1) is provided on a part of the footwear lying 

above the ankle. 
Footwear as in Claim 13, characterized in that
 
   
the tension element (9) which closes the footwear (2) over the instep 
runs from the central closure (1) in guides (22) which under tension do 

not or scarcely shorten. 
Footwear as in Claim 14, characterized in that
 
   the guides (22) are provided in the region (3) of the joint.
