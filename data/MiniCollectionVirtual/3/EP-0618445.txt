<ABSTRACT>
A method and a test probe are proposed for examining surfaces of electrically conductive materials by means of a test coil which generates an alternating magnetic field to which the material to be examined is exposed. According to the invention, the method has the following steps:   - setting an AC coil frequency at which the penetration depth of the alternating magnetic field into the material (15) to be examined lies within a required thickness of the treated surface layer (17,18), - measuring the change in inductance which is caused by the alternating magnetic field being set up in the coil (10), - deriving information regarding at least one material property of the surface (16, 17, 18) examined in the region of the penetration depth of the alternating magnetic field from the measurement result.   The proposed method is expediently carried out for a plurality of frequencies which are chosen so that the penetration depths of the magnetic fields into the material (15) to be examined increase in equidistant steps.

Method for the nondestructive testing of surfaces
of electrically conductive materials by means of a coil

(10) which generates an alternating magnetic field to
which the material to be tested is exposed, a coil

alternating current frequency at which the depth of
penetration of the alternating magnetic field into the

material (15) is within a thickness required for the
surface layer (17, 18) which is to be tested being set

and applied to the coil, 
characterized in that
 the
change in the inductance of this coil (10), which

causes the alternating magnetic field to be established
therein, is measured, and a statement concerning at

least one materials property of the tested surface (16,
17, 18) in the region of the depth of penetration of

the alternating magnetic field is derived from this
measurement.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the coil alternating current frequency is set in such a
way that the depth of penetration of the alternating

magnetic field into the material (15) is low compared
to a required thickness of the surface layer (17, 18)

which is to be tested.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the coil alternating current frequency is set in such a
way that the depth of penetration of the alternating

magnetic field into the material (15) approximately 
corresponds to a required thickness of the surface

layer (17, 18) which is to be tested.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the materials property tested is the hardness of the
surface (16, 17, 18).
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that

the hardness is determined by assigning the measurement
result obtained for the inductance to a predetermined

hardness value.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized by
 the
following steps:


setting a coil alternating current frequency,
determining the coil inductance which is
established,
deriving a statement concerning the mean hardness
of the treated surface layer (17, 18) in the

region of the depth of penetration of the
alternating magnetic field into the material (15)

from the measurement result for a set alternating
current frequency,
repeating the previous steps for a plurality of
frequencies which lie within a frequency range,
recording a hardness profile curve from all the
measured values obtained at the different

alternating current frequencies.
Method according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that

the coil alternating current frequencies are selected
in such a way that the associated depths of penetration

increase at equidistant intervals from a lowest depth
of penetration to a greatest depth of penetration.
Method according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that

a statement concerning the thickness of the surface 
layer (17, 18) is derived from the path of the hardness

profile curve.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that

the thickness of a joining layer (18) is determined
from at least two successive measurement results.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that

the presence of a joining layer is verified by
plausibility considerations.
