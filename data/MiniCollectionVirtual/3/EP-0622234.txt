<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printer includes a movable carriage (12) 
supported above an ink-receiving 

medium (24) by a rail (14) defining a carriage axis, 
with a cartridge holder (16) 

mounted on said carriage having a plurality of 
cartridge compartments (18) each 

receiving a respective thermal ink jet printer 
cartridge (20). A unitary 

latch assembly (94) secures all four cartridges 
inside their respective cartridge 

compartments (18) of cartridge holder (16). The latch 
assembly comprises a metallic 

spring (96) and four forwardly facing latch ends 
separated by five respective 

forwardly facing supporting ends (100). Each latch end 
is connected to its two 

adjacent supporting ends by a serpentine arm defined by suitable radiused 
cutouts in the stamped spring to provide a shape that approximates a 

constant stress geometry. Each supporting end is terminated by a straight 
edge which is inserted into a corresponding slot at the upper rear of 

cartridge holder; because the latch assembly is a single unit, only one 
assembly operation is required for all four cartridge compartments. Because 

of the serpentine shape of the individual serpentine arm, it is possible to 
provide a spring that is relatively compact from front to rear and yet 

provides a relatively substantial constant downwards force on the top rear 
of the cartridge over a relatively large deflection range. Each latch end is 

provided with a cam preferably molded of a low friction material and shaped 
in the form of a horizontal section of an inclined cylinder. A lower tangential 

plane on the cylindrical surface intersects the plane of the latch end at an 
oblique angle, thereby producing a sideways force component to maintain 

a datum surface on an upper side edge of the cartridge in contact with a 
corresponding supporting surface on an interior side wall of the cartridge 

holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to inkjet printers having
multiple printing cartridges each having its own nozzle assembly and ink
reservoir, and more particularly to a spring clamp for ensuring accurate and
stable alignment of the cartridges when installed in a printer having a
multiple compartment cartridge holder.From US 4 755 836 it is known to provide an inkjet printer with a pair
of replaceable printing cartridges (each having at least one nozzle assembly
and associated ink reservoir) mounted on a common carriage, and to
maintain registration between the cartridges and the carriage by means of 
alignment and registration features such as protuberances, shims, opening
and surfaces. A separate latch mechanism is provided for each cartridge
which provides a loading force in all three coordinate axes and cooperates
with the registration and alignment features to prevent pitch, yaw and roll
of the cartridge.From US 4 872 026 it is known to facilitate the installation of a single
inkjet cartridge by providing a lower pivot below an electrical interface,
adjacent the intersection of the contact and nozzle planes, with the single
cartridge being held in its installed position by an appropriately shaped upper
latch spring.In accordance with the present invention, a unitary
latch assembly secures a plurality of cartridges inside their respective
cartridge compartments of a cartridge holder for an inkjet printer. Because
the latch assembly is a single unit, only one assembly operation is required
for all four cartridge compartments.More specifically, the unitary latch assembly comprises a metallic
spring and a plurality of forwardly facing latch ends separated by respective
forwardly facing supporting ends. Each latch end is connected
to its two adjacent supporting ends by a serpentine arm defined by suitable
radiused cutouts in the stamped spring to provide a shape that approximates
a constant stress geometry; each supporting end is preferably terminated by
a straight edge which is inserted into a corresponding slot at the upper rear
of cartridge holder. Because of the serpentine shape of the individual
serpentine arm, it is possible to provide a spring that is relatively compact
from front to rear and yet provides a substantial downwards force on the
top rear of the cartridge over a relatively large deflection range.Each latch end may be provided with
a cam preferably molded of a low friction material and shaped in the form
of a horizontal section of an inclined cylinder. A lower tangential plane

<CLAIMS>
A printer carriage (12) comprising:

a cartridge holder (16) for carrying a plurality of pen cartridges (20) sideways
along a predetermined first axis (X), and
a unitary latch (94) for simultaneously holding all the pen cartridges (20)
inside the holder (16), said unitary latch comprising a corresponding

plurality of bifurcated serpentine latch arms (102) defined in a flat
spring (96), each of said latch arms comprising a latch end (98) for

holding a respective said pen cartridge (20) and a respective pair of
supporting ends (100) connected to said latch end (98) and disposed

at either side thereof,

wherein all said latch ends (98) and all said supporting ends (100) are
connected portions of the same flat spring (96) and face in a same forward

direction (+Y) along a second axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the first
axis (X).
The printer carriage of claim 1, wherein

the flat spring (96) is substantially parallel to the first and second axes (X, Y)
and is substantially perpendicular to a third axis (Z);
each said each supporting end (100) is terminated by a straight edge (104)
which is inserted into a corresponding slot (106) in the pen cartridge

holder (16);
the cartridge holder (16) is supported on a rail (14) oriented substantially
parallel to the first axis (X) and below (-Z) the flat spring (96);
a major portion (70) of each pen cartridge (20) is held above (+Z) and in front
of (+Y) the rail (14), and
each slot (106) is disposed above (+Z) and behind (-Y) a respective pen
cartridge (20).
The printer carriage of claim 1, wherein

the flat spring has a first coefficient of friction, and 
a respective cartridge cam (108) of a low friction material having a second
coefficient of friction substantially less than said first coefficient is

disposed on each said latch end (96).
The printer carriage of claim 3, wherein

each said cam (108) has a lower surface that is tilted relative to the flat spring
(96), for applying both a downward force (-Z) and a sideways force

(+X2) to a corresponding force receiving surface (112) on the
respective pen cartridge (20).
The printer carriage of claim 4, wherein

said cam (108) includes a cylindrical portion with a cylindrical axis that is tilted
with respect to both said first axis (X) and said second axis (Y); and
said lower surface is defined on said cylindrical portion.
