<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel dimerized thiourea
derivative, a near-infrared absorbent composition comprising
the dimerized thiourea derivative and a copper compound, a
near-infrared absorbent obtained by heating the composition,
a near-infrared absorbent resin obtained by melting the
near-infrared absorbent composition or the near-infrared
absorbent, and a heat wave shielding material using the
near-infrared absorbent resin.In EP-A-0 346 772 (based on Japanese patent applications 145262/88 and
232075/88, laid open as Japanese OPI 2-3493 and 2-80486, respectively,) and in
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publications (Japanese
OPI) 2-34682 and 3-246256, the inventors
already disclosed a near-infrared absorbent composition
comprising a thiourea compound and a copper compound, a
near-infrared absorbent material obtained by heating the
composition, and a near-infrared absorbent resin molding
containing the absorbents in a resin, or a near-infrared 
absorbent resin molding obtained by mixing the absorbents
with a radical polymerization initiator and heating the
mixture to polymerize.These near-infrared absorbents obtained by heating a
composition comprising a thiourea compound and a copper
compound are inexpensive compared to near-infrared absorbent
dyes known in the past, and superior in terms of light
fastness and near-infrared absorption range.However, when containing a composition comprising a
prior art thiourea compound and a copper compound in a resin
and molding to a pellet or a specified form, the composition
tends to undergo partial decomposition due to the molding
heat, resulting in gas evolution.Therefore, a primary object of the present invention is
to provide a near-infrared absorbent composition, and a
near infrared absorbent, which, heat molded to produce a
near-infrared absorbent resin, do not decompose or generate
malodorous gases at the molding temperature, a near-infrared
absorbent resin containing these near-infrared absorbent
composition and near-infrared absorbent, and a heat wave
shielding material comprising the resin. The above object is attained by a thiourea compound
(hereinafter referred to as "dimerized thiourea compound")
which has two thiourea structures (-NH-(C=S)-NH-) in the
molecule.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided a composition comprising a
copper compound and a dimerized thiourea compound of Formula [1]:

wherein A denotes CH2, (CH2)2, S, O, SO2, CONH, NH, or
C(CF3)2; the two substituents R, which may be the same or different, are each
