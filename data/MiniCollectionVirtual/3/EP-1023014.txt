<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a vacuum centering device (100) which may be used in conjunction with other surgical instruments in opthomological surgery. The device provides an improved interface with the eye (350) by way of features that reduce interference with a patient's eyelids intraoccular pressure and/or the propensity to rotate. These features may include a flared outer wall portion (304) which may either be curved or straight for a section, providing a low profile vacuum chamber (355), and/or the use of a non-circular outer sealing region potentially producing a saddle-shaped outer periphery providing for potentially increased vaccum exposure to the eye and a contour resistant to rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COR EAL VACUUM CENTERING DEVICEField of the Invention The present invention relates generally to corneal surgery and, more particularly, to a vacuum centering device which is fixable in position with respect to the human eye, stabilizing the shape and position of the eye during surgical operations. Background of the InventionAnomalies in the overall shape of the eye can cause visual disorders. Hyperopia ("farsightedness") occurs when the front-to-back distance in the eyeball is too small. In such a case, parallel rays originating greater than 20 feet from the eye focus behind the retina. In contrast, when the front-to-back distance of eyeball is too large, myopia ("nearsightedness") occurs and the focus of parallel rays entering the eye occurs in front of the retina. Astigmatism is a condition which occurs when the parallel rays of light do not come to a single point within the eye, but rather have a variable focus due to the fact that the cornea is aspherical and refracts light in a different meridian at different distances. Some degree of astigmatism is normal, but where it is too high, it must often be corrected.Hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism are usually corrected by glasses or contact lenses. Surgical methods for the correction of such disorders are known. Such methods include radial keratotomy (see, e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 4,815,463 and 4,688,570) and laser corneal Ablation (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,941,093). Further methods include the implantation of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rings, allograft corneal tissue, and hydrogels is well documented. U.S. Patent No. 4,452,235, to Reynolds, for example, describes a method and apparatus for corneal curvature adjustment involving the implantation of polymeric rings in the eye's corneal stroma to change the curvature of the cornea.Vacuum devices useful for such ocular surgical procedures are common. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,423,728, to Lieberman, shows a cam-guided trephine for selectively cutting a circular or V-shaped groove about the cornea. The device utilizes a pair of suction rings which affix the apparatus onto the sclera of the patients eye. The vacuum is usually less than about 10cm of water thereby avoiding raising the intraocular 

pressure above the physiological levels. The suction ring lies in the anatomically constant area just outside the limbus.Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,437 to Grieshaber, shows a process and apparatus for cornea grinding. The device has a base member which is held to the conjunctiva of the eye by a
