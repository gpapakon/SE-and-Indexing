<ABSTRACT>
A sense element is provided which has a 
boron doped silicon body (12) positioned above and parallel 

to a substrate (10) with a plurality of openings (50,51) 
extending through the semiconductive body, the plurality of 

openings (50,51) producing a damping such that the natural 
frequency and the measurement bandwidth of the sense element 

are modified. The body (12) is rotatable about a flexure 
axis (28) located above and parallel to the substrate (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates sense elements for use in
accelerometers.Transducers which translate nonelectrical quantities
into electrical signals have long been known. These devices
are designed to provide a usable output in response to a
particular physical quantity, property or condition which is
desired to be measured. The term 'sense element' has been
used to define both the overall transducer as well as the
transducer element which performs the first step in a multistep
translation process. For the purposes of the instant
invention, the latter definition will govern.Transducers with sense elements used to measure
acceleration are known as accelerometers. Accelerometer
applications in the automotive industry include
incorporation into crash sensors for air bag deployment and
ride motion sensors for active suspension components.
Accelerometers also find use in the military and aerospace
industries as rate of climb indicators and as components in
smart weapons and missile arming devices.Prior art sense elements have had difficulty in
obtaining and maintaining the strength and response
characteristics required by the rigorous working environment
of such accelerometers. These sense elements relied heavily
on cantilevered beams, seismic masses, and cylinder/ball
arrangements affected by fluid pressure and travelling
friction. These devices suffered from extreme fragility and
breakage problems. In addition, it has often been difficult
to make these prior art sense elements efficiently and
economically, due to the rigours of large scale
manufacturing processes. Finally, these devices often
exhibit excess and undesired sensitivity in orthogonal axes. The present invention is concerned with a capacitive sense
element for an accelerometer, comprising a substrate having a
substantially planar upper surface with at least two fixed
conductive plates thereon and a substantially planar
deflectable body positioned above and parallel to the
substrate, the body comprising:
a) a pedestal attached to the substrate and surrounded by an
internal opening in the body;b) a first upper plate and a second upper plate corresponding
to the fixed conductive plates to form a first and a second
capacitor; andc) a pair of oppositely directed torsion arms connecting the
body to the pedestal and forming a flexure axis around which
the first and second upper plates deflect, the total moment of
the second upper plate about the flexure axis being greater than
the total moment of the first upper plate about the flexure
axis such that the body

A capacitive sense element (8) for an accelerometer,

   a substrate (10) having a substantially planar upper
surface (14) with at least two fixed conductive plates (16, 18)

thereon and a substantially planar deflectable body (12)
positioned above and parallel to the substrate, the body

comprising:

a) a pedestal (30) attached to the substrate and surrounded
by an internal opening (32) in the body;
b) a first upper plate (38) and a second upper plate (40)
corresponding to the fixed conductive plates (16, 18) to form

a first and a second capacitor; and
c) a pair of oppositely directed torsion arms (36) connecting
the body (12) to the pedestal (30) and forming a flexure axis
