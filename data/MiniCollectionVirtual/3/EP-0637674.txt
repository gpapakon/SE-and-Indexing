<ABSTRACT>
This is a burglary-preventing door designed to resist a burglary (attack) on the hinge side. The edge (50) of the door leaf (16) is extended, at least at the level of the locking device, by a metal strip (35) which projects with respect to the door leaf (16). This metal strip (35) penetrates, when the door is closed, into a slot (38) made in the thickness of the jamb lining (trim) (14), more precisely in the extension of the join (34) between the jamb lining (14) and the edge (50). This is also a burglary-preventing door designed to resist a burglary on the hinge side. In the latter, the slot is arranged in the door leaf and the jamb lining is equipped with a planar metal strip which projects.

Burglar-proof door devised to resist a break-in from the hinge side
comprising a casing (14) to be integrated into an opening and an articulated

panel (16) on the side of a first edge on the casing (14) and provided on the
side of a second edge (50), opposite the first edge, with a locking device, the

said second edge (50) defining, in closed position of the door, with the casing
(14) a joint (34) on the breaking-in side, 
and
 at least at the locking device, with a
metal band (35) which projects in relation to the panel (16) in such manner,

when the door is ciosed, as to penetrate into a corresponding slot (38) of the
casing (14), which is disposed in the thickness of the casing (14) in the

extension of the said joint (34), 
characterised in that
 the projecting part (36) of
the metal band (35) which penetrates into the slot (38) is dimensioned in such

manner so that, when bearing with a tool on this projecting part (36) in order to
force the joint (34), this projecting part (38) can become deformed:
a) 
either in a manner so as to be applied against a surface (42)
which laterally delimits the slot:
b) 
or in a manner so as to be bent over behind a flange (48) located
at the entrance to the slot.
Burglar-proof door devised to resist a break-in from the side opposite
the hinges comprising a casing (114) to be integrated into an opening and an

articulated panel (116) on the side of a first edge on the casing (114) and
provided on the side of the second edge, opposite the first edge, with a locking

device, 
characterised in that
 the casing (114) is laterally delimited on the side
provided with the locking device, at least at the locking device, by a flat metal

band (135) which projects beyond in such manner, when the door is closed, as
to penetrate into a corresponding slot (138) of the panel (116) which is disposed

in the thickness of the panel along the said second edge of the panel (114), 
the
projecting part (136) of the metal band (35) which penetrates into the slot (138)

being dimensioned in such manner so that, when bearing with a tool on this
projecting part (136) in order to force the joint (134), this projecting part (136)

can become deformed:
a) 
either in a manner so as to be applied against a surface (142)
which laterally delimits the slot (138):
b) 
or in a manner so as to be bent over behind a flange (148) located
at the entrance to the slot (138).
Burglar-proof door according to either one of the claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the depth of penetration of the metal band (35, 135) into
the slot (38, 138) is greater than the width of the slot (38, 138) at its entrance.
Burglar-proof door according to any one of the claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the said slot (38, 138) has a narrow passage section, in
the direction of penetration of the metal band (35, 135), followed by a widening

(43) in the direction of the panel (16), in the case of the door according to claim
1, and by a widening (143) in the direction of the casing (114), in the case of the

door according to claim 2.
Burglar-proof door according to any one of the claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the slot (38, 138) has an almost constant width.
Burglar-proof door according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the slot
(38, 138) is defined by a channel bar which is approximately U-shaped of which

a first arm (46, 146) is provided with a flange (48, 148) directed towards the
second arm, so as to define, for the projecting element, a narrow passage

section (44, 144) between the flange (48, 148) of the first arm (46, 146) and the
second arm.
Burglar-proof door according to any one of the claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the slot (38, 138) and the metal band (35, 135) have
approximately the same length as the said second edge of the panel (16, 116).
Burglar-proof door according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 a third
side of the door is equipped with a slot metal band system of the type with

which the said second side of the door is fitted.
