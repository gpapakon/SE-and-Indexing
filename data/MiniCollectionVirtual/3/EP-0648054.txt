<ABSTRACT>
A television presentation and editing system uses closed 
captioning 

text to locate items of interest. A closed captioning decoder (103) 
extracts 

a closed captioning digital text stream from a television signal. 
A viewer specifies one or more keywords to be used as search parameters. 

A digital processor (104) executing a control program scans the 
closed captioning digital text stream for words or phrases matching the 

search parameters. The corresponding segment of the television 
broadcast may then be displayed, edited or saved. In one mode of 

operation, the television presentation system may be used to scan one 
or more television channels unattended, and save items which may be 

of interest to the viewer. In another mode of operation, the system may 
be used to assist editing previously stored video by quickly locating 

segments of interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to television and other video information,
and in particular to a novel method and apparatus for selectively
viewing television or other video signals.Television has become the world's predominant communications
medium. The variety of programming available on television has
mushroomed in recent years with the growth of cable networks. In
many areas, a viewer can select programming from among dozens of
channels, broadcasting news, talk shows, movies, soap operas, serials,
etc., from Geraldo Rivera to William F. Buckley, from the banal to the
sublime (or the reverse, depending on one's point of view).Although a large amount of information is broadcast via television,
the capability to selectively view television is primitive. Published
television listings typically contain a minimal amount of information
about the program to be shown, are often difficult to understand, and
are subject to frequent errors and changes. Furthermore, a certain
amount of television programming, such as a news broadcast, by its
nature can not be described in advance.Most viewers would like greater control over what is being viewed.
They may, for example, wish to view specific portions of a news program
or a talk show dealing with a topic of interest. They may wish to
monitor multiple channels simultaneously. They may wish to screen
out programming they regard as offensive.In theory, a viewer could record one or more television signals on
one or more recording devices, such as commonly available video 
cassette recorders (VCRs), and review all recorded signals, editing such
portions as desired. In reality, this would be an extremely tedious and
time consuming task.There has been some recognition of a need to provide a viewer with
greater control over what is being watched. For example, it is known in
the art to place a small window in one corner of the television
display, in which is shown the video signal of another broadcast
channel, enabling the viewer to screen one channel while simultaneously
watching another. As helpful as this feature is to the viewer, it is
obviously limited in its capabilities. Screening multiple channels
would require a separate window for each one. The screening must be
done at the time the signal is broadcast. If something of interest is
detected, the channel must be switched, possibly foregoing programming
of interest on the channel first being viewed.Television viewers have accepted this lack of ability to screen,
preview or extract portions of television programming

<CLAIMS>
A television presentation system, comprising:


a television signal receiver for receiving a television signal from an external
source;
a closed captioning decoder for extracting from said television signal a closed
captioning stream of textual data;
means for receiving from a user one or more search parameters, said search
parameters representing information content of interest to the user;
means for searching said stream of textual data for occurrences of textual
data matching said one or more search parameters;
means for identifying one or more segments of said television signal, each
said segment consisting of video and audio portions and corresponding to an occurrence of said textual data matching

said one or more search parameters.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said one or
more search parameters comprise one or more key words.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 2, wherein said one or
more search parameters comprise a plurality of key words, linked by one or

more logical relationships.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: 

means for storing said television signal; and
means for editing said stored television signal.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 4, wherein said means
for editing said television signal comprises means for deleting portions of said

signal in the vicinity of said one or more segments corresponding to
occurrences of said textual data matching said one or more search

parameters.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 4, wherein said means
for editing said television signal comprises means for deleting portions of said

signal other than said one or more segments corresponding to occurrences of
said textual data matching said one or more search parameters.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a
display for displaying a television signal, wherein said display, said television

signal receiver, said closed captioning decoder, said search parameter
receiving means, and said segment identifying means are an integrated unit.
A television presentation system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising
means, responsive to said means for identifying one or more segments, for

storing said one or more segments of said television signal corresponding to
occurrences of said textual data matching said one or more search

parameters.
A method for identifying television data of interest, comprising the steps of:

specifying one or more search parameters for identifying television data of
interest, said search parameters representing information content of interest; 
receiving a television signal;
decoding a closed captioning portion of said television signal to produce a
closed captioning stream of textual data;
searching said closed captioning stream of textual data for data which
matches said one or more search parameters;
identifying one or more segments of said television signal, each said segment consisting of video and audio portions and
corresponding to an occurrence of said closed captioning stream of textual

data matching said one or more search parameters.
A method for identifying television data of interest as claimed in claim 9,
wherein said one or more search parameters comprise one or more key

words.
A method for identifying television data of interest as claimed in claim 10,
wherein said one or more search parameters comprise one or more key

words, linked by one or more logical relationships.
