<ABSTRACT>
A vertebrate, non-human transgenic animal whose 
cells, both somatic and germinal, contain a recombinant 

genetic construction formed of a marker gene and a 
regulator region capable of being induced in the epidermis 

of said transgenic animal in response to 
hyperproliferative stimuli, the genetic construction of 

which has been introduced into the animal or into an 
antecessor of the animal in an embryonic stage. The 

genetic construction is induced also in the bulb of the 
hair in the phase of active growth or anagen. 
The said genetic construction consists of a marker 
gene characterized by the fact that it is easily 

detectable, under the control of the regulator region of 
the gene of the K6 keratin, this protein being 

characterized by its ability to be induced in the 
suprabasal layers of the epidermis in response to 

hyperproliferative stimuli both endogenous (tumors, 
cicatrization of wounds, diseases which, such as 

psoriasis, produce hyperproliferation, etc.) and exogenous 
(topical treatments with retinoic acid, TPA, etc.). 

Therefore, transgenic animals carrying this genetic 
construction in their genome are useful in the 

identification of physical, chemical or biological agents 
which lead to epidermal hyperproliferation and growth of 

the hair, or inhibit these processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to nonhuman transgenic 
animals which can be used as model system for the 
identification of agents which induce or and protect 
epidermal hyperproliferation, such as, for instance, 
radiations, chemical and cosmetic compounds, pathologies, 
etc. The invention is also useful for the detection of 
agents which influence the hair cycle. Transgenic animals are animals which bear an 
exogenous gene (called transgene) in their genome which 
has been introduced either in them themselves or in an 
antecessor. Due to the fact that the exogenous gene is 
also present in the germ cells of these animals, the 
transgene is transmitted from parent to children so that 
it is possible to establish lines of transgenic animals 
from a first founder animal. The introduction of the 
transgene into the fertilized oocyte maximizes the 
possibilities of the transgene being present in all the 
cells, both somatic and germinal, of the founder animal. 
The latter will transmit the transgene to approximately 
half of its descendants, which will carry it in all its 
cells. If the transgene is introduced in a later embryonic 
stage, the founder animal would be a mosaic since not all 
its somatic and germinal cells will carry the transgene. 
This would have the result that a smaller proportion of 
descendants carries the transgene; however, the 
descendants which inherit it would carry in all their 
cells, including the germ cells. One problem when transgenic animals are generated is 
that not all of them are founders and therefore the 
corresponding lines generated from them express the 
transgene which they carry. This effect, known as position 
effect, is due to the fact that the transgene can be  
 
integrated in any place of the genome of the transgenic 
animal. If the integration takes place in a 
heterochromatin region, the activity of the transgene may 
be suppressed in whole or in part. Alternatively, if the 
transgene is integrated near the regulator region of a 
gene, the activity of the transgene may be altered or even 
come to be controlled by this "foreign" regulator region 
instead of by the one which it bears. For this reason, 
once the transgenic animals have been identified, it is 
necessary to proceed to determine in which of them the 
transgene is suitably expressed. Although it is possible to generate transgenic 
animals of differrent species, most of the work in this 
field has been done with mice. Transgenic animals in 
general, and mice in particular, are of great utility as 
mode
