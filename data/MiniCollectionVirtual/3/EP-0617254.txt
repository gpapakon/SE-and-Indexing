<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining the thickness of wheel rims or tyres on wheels of sets of railway wheels. In order to determine this thickness, it is proposed to illuminate the profile zones of the wheel which are relevant for a thickness to be determined, doing so by means of a light section or a light edge, and to use optical means to detect the light trace thereby produced. The trace is then digitised and the thickness is determined from the digitised values. In this case, the light edge is preferably to extend radially.
