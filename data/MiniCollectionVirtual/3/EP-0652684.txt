<ABSTRACT>
Device (ATM_LM) for the conversion into ATM cells of 

information segments (SAR_PDU) coming from an higher 
adaptation layer (AAL) and accompanied by connection and 

application identification parameters (ID_AAL.ID_SSCS), as 
well as for the reverse conversion, from ATM cells coming 

from an ATM layer and including channel (VCI) and path 
(VPI) identifications, into information segments including 

connection and application identification parameters 
(ID_AAL.ID_SSCS). It includes a traffic forming or shaping 

unit (ATMU) controlling the sequence of ATM cells 
transmission to the ATM layer according to parameters 

contained in a memory unit (SHAPER_RAM). These parameters 
relate to traffic profiles of each connection of the higher 

adaptation layer (AAL) and are updated by a microprocessor 
(CONTROL_µP) as number and characteristics of these 

connections vary.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to broadband networks or B-ISDN 
(Broadband Integrated Service Digital Network) of the ATM 
type (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and founds its 
application both in access parts to the network (terminals, 
concentrators, adapters, Inter working Units) and in 
switching nodes (server, signalling processors). The invention is applied to data transfer through said 
broadband networks. Figure 1 shows for example sake only, 
an ATM node, including in short, a switching network ATM_SW 
to which several access posts CPN₁, ..., CPNk (Customer 
Premises Network) and a connectionless server CS are 
connected. Data generated by applications (e.g. word processor or 
electronic sheets) of an user connected to the B-ISDN 
network are structured in packets varying in length from 
some bytes to tenths of thousands of bytes. To be able to 
transmit these packets on ATM networks, it is necessary to 
adapt the packet format to the ATM cell format, consisting 
of 48 information bytes or payload and 5 header bytes 
totalling 53 bytes. Packets shall therefore be segmented to be included 
payloads of ATM cells. To make typical checks of 
transmission networks (error, sequence, etc.) some of the 
48 available bytes are occupied by additional information 
while the remaining bytes are occupied by the message 
portions (segments). Of course, the user receiving the 
cells shall perform the reverse operation (re-assembly) to 
obtain again the message starting from ATM payloads. Conversion of the user information into ATM cells to 
be sent to the line is made through an ordered succession 
or stack of different layer protocols, shown in summary in  
 
Fig. 2 where rectangles represent the complex of operations 
made on data. Transfer of data involves the execution of 
protocols of different hierarchical level from top to 
bottom; in the reception phase protocols are made from 
bottom to top. The invention more particularly relates to the 
so-called ATM layer which, as shown in the attached Fig. 2, 
is placed between the Physical Layer (PHI) and the 
adaptation layer (ATM Adaptation Layer) AAL. A hardware 
implementation of this last (AAL 3/4) formed the subject of 
a previous patent application in the name of the same 
applicant, deposited on 18.12.1992 under No. MI92A 
002880. It is well known that for ATM systems a negotiation is 
foreseen between the network managing company and the user 
concerning the bit rate this one can transmit. 
Consequently, data transmission shall be "governed" at all 
points of an
