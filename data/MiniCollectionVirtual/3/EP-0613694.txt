<ABSTRACT>
An ophthalmic lens for placement on the anterior 
surface of the eye is disclosed. The lens has impregnated 

in it or it has coated on its surface an ester of a 
polyhydric aliphatic alcohol and a fatty acid in which the 

alcohol residue has at least one hydroxyl group. The 
ester is present in an amount which is effective to 

prevent or decrease the release of bacterial toxins when 
the lens is exposed to those toxins. The lens is 

particularly well-suited for a soft hydrogel contact lens, 
and advantageously eliminates, minimizes or prevents 

keratitis. Bacterial keratitis is an infection of the 
cornea of the eye which may occur during extended wear of 

the lens and may cause ulceration of the cornea.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ophthalmic lens with
improved properties especially adapted for extended wear
applications. More specifically, it relates to an
ophthalmic lens which contains a compound capable of
preventing or decreasing the release of bacterial toxins
into the eye.A dramatic shift has taken place over the past decade
concerning ophthalmic lens technology, and improvements in
this technology have led to changes in the manner in which
ophthalmic lenses can be worn by the patient. As
technology has advanced, it is now possible to wear
ophthalmic lenses for extended periods of time, even
during periods of sleep. This has occurred because these
lenses, particularly contact lenses, have become more
compatible with delicate eye tissue. Consequently,
patient comfort has increased to the point where the lens
can be worn by the patient for extended periods without
significant discomfort. The type of contact lens which is
most closely associated with extended wear applications is
a soft hydrogel lens, which consists of a hydrophilic
polymer swollen with a substantial amount of water.Unfortunately, the use of ophthalmic lenses for
extended wear applications has not been free of problems.
For example, bacterial infections of the cornea have been
reported. In the presence of minor trauma to the outer 
surface of the cornea (epithelium), bacteria may enter and
ultimately ulcerate the cornea (ulcerative keratitis), a
condition which, if not properly treated, can be
responsible for sight-threatening damage to the cornea.While attempts have been made to make contact lenses
which are capable of fighting off bacterial infections in
general, little has been accomplished to design a lens
which is capable of preventing or decreasing the release
of toxins which may cause ulcerative keratitis. The
common approach has been to impregnate the lens with a
broad spectrum antimicrobial. Meslard et al. (Polym.
Prepr. Am. Chem. Soc., Div. Polym. Chem. 30 p. 488-489
(1989)), describe a reversible chemical immobilization of
indomethacin, which is an anti-inflammatory agent, onto
ophthalmic hydrogels. The drug is hydrolytically cleaved
and released from the lens on the eye. Schwartz et al.
(Am. J. Ophthalmol., 109, pages 701-704) describe the use
of contact lenses formed from collagen to release
amphotericin B, which is an anti-fungal agent, to rabbit
eyes. U.S. Patent 4,931,279 describes a contact lens made
with an ion exchange resin and a drug such as pilocarpine,
which is an anti-glaucoma agent, for release into the
