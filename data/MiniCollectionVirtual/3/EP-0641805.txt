<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a polymer having 
antimicrobial properties derived from one or more 

ethylenically unsaturated monomers characterised in 
that the polymer has a phenolic antimicrobial agent 

covalently bound thereto. The polymer may be used as 
a sanitizing agent in a sanitising composition 

comprising a solvent having a sanitising agent 
dissolved or dispersed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polymers having
antimicrobial properties and to compositions containing
them.Polymeric materials having antimicrobial properties
are known. For example US-A-4 908 381 describes
polymers derived from ethylenically unsaturated
monomers having side chains terminating in a pyran
derivative. The polymers can be applied to a surface
from solution in an organic solvent such as acetone to
provide a film of the polymer over the surface. The
film protects the surface from microbial growth through
the slow release of the potent antimicrobial agent,
glutaraldehyde, upon contact with water.US-A-3,492,223 describes a polymer comprising a
polymeric morpholinone compound complexed with a
phenol, thiophenol, naphthol, thionaphthol or
derivatives thereof.An object of the invention is to provide a polymer
which will provide prolonged antimicrobial activity
without releasing an antimicrobial agent. A further
object is to provide such a polymer wherein the
antimicrobial activity is provided, at least in part,
by a phenolic antimicrobial agent.In accordance with the invention there is provided a
polymer having antimicrobial properties derived from
one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers which 
polymer has a phenolic antimicrobial agent covalently
bound thereto and wherein the covalent linkage between
the phenolic antimicrobial agent and the polymer
comprises a quatenary nitrogen atom.The invention also provides a sanitizing composition
comprising a solvent having a sanitizing agent
dissolved or dispersed therein characterised in that
the sanitizing agent comprises a polymer of the
invention.The polymers of the invention can be coated on
surfaces to provide the antimicrobial protection
afforded by a phenolic antimicrobial agent over a
prolonged period.The polymers can provide unexpectedly low
concentration efficacy and low dilution factor.In the polymers of the invention, additional
antimicrobial protection is afforded by the presence of
both the quaternary and phenolic groups in the polymer.Preferably, the monomers from which the polymer is
derived include monomers which are quaternisable or
which are capable of reacting with amine or hydroxyl
groups. Such monomers include ethylenically
unsaturated carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated
carboxylic anhydrides, aminoalkyl esters of
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, 
hydroxyalkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated
carboxylic acids, and glycidyl esters of ethylenically
unsaturated carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated
nitrogen
