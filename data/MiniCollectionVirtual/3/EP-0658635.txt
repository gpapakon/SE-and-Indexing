<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an annealing apparatus employing a conductor roll for use
in annealing wire, such as copper wire, comprising a
substrate having good electrical conductivity and a top
coating of tungsten or a tungsten based alloy with a
surface roughness of said coating of at least 2 µm
Ra.In the annealing of copper wire, copper rolls or
hoops are used to heat the wire by the Joule effect.
Copper is the preferred material for the conductor roll
because it has good conductivity. In a typical or
conventional annealing apparatus, the copper wire is
fed in contact over two spaced apart conductive rolls
connected to a power source. One roll is positive
while the other roll is negative. Heat is generated in
the copper wire when the rolls are connected to a power
source since the copper wire completes the circuit
between the conductive rolls. In the annealing of
copper wire, the wire is continuously fed over the
conductor rolls as a desired speed whereupon the wire
is heated and then it is cooled in a conventional
manner. The copper wire contacts the conductor rolls
and the friction therebetween causes wear in the
surface of the conductor rolls. Once the wear of the
rolls becomes undesirable for efficient operation of
the annealing process, the rolls are replaced. This
results in a shut down of the annealing operation and
thus loss of productivity. It has been proposed to
substitute nickel in place of copper for the roll 
material since nickel has better wear resistance
characteristics. However, nickel rolls are much more
expensive than copper rolls and are still subject to
wear resistance.In EP-A-0266509 there has been disclosed an apparatus for continuously
annealing metal strips, and a hearth roll employed therein. It was taught to provide
the hearth roll with a predetermined roughness before the hearth roll is coated with a
wear-resistant surface coating defined by a spray coated ceramic or chrome plating.
The thickness of the coating is selected so that the coated hearth roll has a surface
roughness Ra of between 4.5 µm and 20 µm.JP-A-4120297 discloses a conductor roll to be used for electroplating lines for
cold rolled steel plates. The surface of the roll is coated with a hard Cr plating or Ni-W
alloy plating containing about 20 to 24 wt. % tungsten.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an annealing apparatus employing a conductor roll
having
excellent wear
resistance characteristics when used in annealing wire,
such as copper wire.Another object of the present invention is to
provi
