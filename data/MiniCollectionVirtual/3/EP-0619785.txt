<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to mount assemblies, 
especially mount assemblies with slip bushings that are 
used to mount metal stabilizer bars to automobile 
frames. Such mount assemblies are generally comprised 
of a shaped metal attachment bracket which holds a split 
annular rubber bushing in compressive engagement with 
the stabilizer bar when the mount assembly and the 
stabilizer bar are properly secured to the automobile 
frame. The rubber bushing may be separate or may be 
integrally molded to the inside of the bracket member of 
the assembly. In the past, relative movement between the 
metal stabilizer bar and the rubber bushing has lead to 
an annoying squeaking noise when the automobile is in 
use. Several solutions were devised to reduce or 
eliminate the noise problem. One solution was to 
provide a surface on the bushing which has a low coefficient 
of friction such as polymers of polytetraflouroethylene. 
However, this solution presented problems 
with expense, and durability. An alternative solution is presented in 
US-A-4,854,766 to Hein. 
In this 
solution, the mount assembly has an elastomeric inner 
sleeve which is separately mounted around the sway (stabiliser) bar 
and which contacts an outer sleeve. Either the outer 
surface of the inner sleeve, or the inner surface of the 
outer sleeve, or both, are provided with a low friction 
surface so that any slippage caused by movement between 
the mount assemblies and the bar occurs between the  
 
elastomeric materials in radially spaced relation away 
from the bar. In accordance with the present invention, we provide 
a mount assembly for resiliently coupling first and second 
metal structural members, comprising 
   an elastomeric outer sleeve and means for attaching 
the outer sleeve to the second member, the outer sleeve 
having an inner surface defining a hollow to receive and 
at least partially surround the first member; 
   an elastomeric inner sleeve, separate from the outer 
sleeve and mounted on the first member to surround it at 
least partially and to occupy the hollow between the first 
member and the inner surface of the outer sleeve; 
   the outer sleeve's inner surface and the inner 
sleeve's outer surface mating with lower friction than the 
engagement of the inner sleeve's inner surface with the 
first member, thereby forming a slip interface between the 
sleeves to accommodate relative movement between the first 
and second members; 
characterised by 
   means for limiting longitudinal misalignment of the 
inner and outer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mount assembly for resiliently coupling first and 
second metal structural members (10,12), comprising
 
   an elastomeric outer sleeve (9) and means (7) for 

attaching the outer sleeve (9) to the second member (12), 
the outer sleeve (9) having an inner surface defining a 

hollow (35) to receive and at least partially surround the 
first member (10);
 
   an elastomeric inner sleeve (14), separate from the 

outer sleeve (9) and mounted on the first member (10) to 
surround it at least partially and to occupy the hollow 

(35) between the first member (10) and the inner surface 
of the outer sleeve (9);
 
   the outer sleeve's inner surface and the inner 

sleeve's outer surface mating with lower friction than the 
engagement of the inner sleeve's inner surface with the 

first member (10), thereby forming a slip interface 
between the sleeves (14,9) to accommodate relative 

movement between the first and second members (10,12); 
characterised by
 
   means for limiting longitudinal misalignment of the 

inner and outer sleeves (14,9), said means being provided 
at the slip interface by the outer surface of the inner 

sleeve (14) having a circumference gradually increasing in 
its longitudinal axial direction, and by the inner 

surface of the outer sleeve (9) having a circumference 
gradually increasing in its longitudinal axial direction,  

 
so that increasing longitudinal misalignment of the inner 

and outer sleeves (14,9) moves their mating surfaces into 
increasingly tighter cooperation to offer increased 

resistance to further longitudinal misalignment. 
A mount assembly according to claim 1 in which both 
the inner and outer sleeves (14,9) have said increasing 

circumferences, increasing complementarily in opposite 
longitudinal directions. 
A mount assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2 in 
which the increasing sleeve surface circumferences are 

disposed so as to limit axial misalignment in both 
longitudinal directions. 
A mount assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the means limiting longitudinal 

misalignment further comprise internally projecting 
annular flanges (40,41) at ends of the hollow (35) of the 

outer sleeve (9). 
A mount assembly according to any one of claims 1 to 
3 in which the means for limiting longitudinal 

misalignment comprises a circumferential annular flange 
(140) projecting outward from the outer surface of the 

inner sleeve (14). 
A mount assembly according to claim 1 in which the  
 

inner sleeve's outer surface has a barrel shape, with 
oppositely tapering portions (33,34) at two axial ends 

thereof, complementing convergent portions (36,37) of the 
outer sleeve's inner surface at two corresponding axial 

ends of the hollow (35). 
A mount assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the outer sleeve (9) is not 

longitudinally slit. 
A mount assembly according to claim 7 in which the 
outer sleeve (9) is of a material sufficiently flexible 

for the inner sleeve (14) to be inserted into it. 
A mount assembly according to claim 8 in which the 
material of the outer sleeve (9) has a durometer hardness 

of from 40 to 80, and the material of the inner sleeve 
(14) has a durometer hardness of from 50 to 80. 
A mount assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the second member (12) is an 

automobile frame and the first member (10) is a stabiliser 
bar around which the inner sleeve (14) fits. 
A mount assembly according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the means for attaching the 

outer sleeve (9) to the second member (12) comprises a 
shaped metal bracket (8) extending around the outer sleeve 

(9), held to the second member (12) by a clamp member (7).
