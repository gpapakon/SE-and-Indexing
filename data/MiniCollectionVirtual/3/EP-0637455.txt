<ABSTRACT>
A coupling for selective connection of a plurality of 
conduits (2,4) is devised with one or more passages which, by 

rotation and/or displacement of a 
coupling piece (12) are selectively connectable to selected 

conduits at the same time as other conduits are closed. 
The coupling piece is formed of a cannula (12), alternatively is 

formed of a coupling cone or element manoeuvrable by a 
cannula. In a restriction device for a conduit for carrying 

a fluid a first tube (178) 
is connected to a channel (176) formed through an elastic 

body (174) surrounded by a stiff sleeve. A 
connecting second tube (182) has a larger diameter than the 

diameter of the first tube and is intended for application 
against the elastic body from the side away from the first 

tube, a restriction thereby being obtained in the channel by 
axial compression of the elastic body by the second tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coupling for selective 
connection of a plurality of conduits, running to a common 
connection point, for controlling flows for medical 
purposes, said coupling comprising a coupling piece devised 
with one or more passages which are selectively connectable 
by rotation and/or displacement of the coupling piece to 
selected conduits for selective connection of them at the 
same time as other conduits running to the connection point 
are closed by the coupling piece in order to determine a 
path of flow. The invention also relates to a restriction 
device for a conduit for carrying fluids, especially for 
medical purposes too. In a number of application fields, there is a need for a 
multipath coupling between conduits running to a common 
connection point. The coupling must then take up very little 
space and have minimal dead volume. Such couplings are 
useful in e.g. hydraulic systems, such as hydraulic control 
systems for space vehicles, spinal fluid drains, drug 
delivery systems and in medical specimen-taking. A small 
dead volume means that the system in which the coupling is 
employed produces the least possible interference. Today, the flushing of e.g. catheters in implantable 
medication pumps can only be performed via the septum or 
directly through the catheter itself after the latter has 
been detached from the pump. The flushing of a limited part 
of a fluid tract is impossible, and the presence of dead 
volume causes an accumulation of air which can only be 
removed with great difficulty. The object of the present invention is to provide a new 
simple type of multipath coupling which is especially well 
suited for medical purposes.  This purpose is achieved with a coupling of the above-described 
kind with the features set forth in claim 1. With the present invention, a coupling is simply and cheaply 
achieved for selective connection of certain conduits at the 
same time as others are closed. A specific flow path is 
thereby achieved by the selection of a suitably devised 
coupling piece. With the coupling according to the invention e.g. flushing 
of a desired part of a fluid tract is possible as well as 
emptying and filling of a flow system, like an implantable 
medication pump. The coupling according to the invention is not usable solely 
for achieving a desired pathway for the transport of a fluid 
but can also be used for controlling a wire, line or the 
like in a desired way, e.g. for cleaning purposes. A limitless number of multipath connections can be
