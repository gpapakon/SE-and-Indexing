<ABSTRACT>
Load-independent speed control of hydraulic actuators in the case of leading loads, in particular for construction machines, is proposed, comprising at least one pump, at least one control spool, and at least one pressure balance. The pressure balance is inserted either in the connecting line of the space, to be emptied in a controlled manner, of the actuator, designed as hydraulic cylinder, to the control spool or else in the line between the outlet of the control spool and the tank. The return area of the associated control piston is designed as a differential-pressure orifice. The pressure indication before the passage of the oil flow through the differential-pressure orifice to the pressure balance can be brought about via a line to the side of the pressure balance remote from the spring chamber.

Control which is independent of load pressure in respect of the
speed of hydraulic control elements such as cylinders (3), hydraulic motors

(28) or the like, in relation to leading loads on building machines such as
for example wheel loaders, excavators, graders or the like, comprising at

least one pump (17) with a delivery volume which is variable by a regulator
(16), for delivering a pressure fluid from a tank (9), and at least one spool

valve (4) having at least one control spool (5) for actuation of the control
element or elements (3, 28), wherein there is provided a pressure scale

device (11) and wherein the return region of the control spool (5) is in the
form of a differential pressure orifice (8), wherein the pressure of the oil

flow prior to passing through the differential pressure orifice (8) can be
transferred by way of a line (7) on to the side (10) of the pressure scale

device (11), which is remote from the spring chamber (14), characterised
in that the pressure scale device (11) is fitted into the connecting line (6)

from the chamber (2) to be emptied of the control element (3) or from the
control element (28) to the control spool (5), and that there are provided a

control line (12) for taking off the pressure after the differential pressure
orifice (8) and a load pressure signalling line (15) for taking off the load

pressure produced by the pump (17), the control line and the load pressure
signalling line each leading to a common change-over valve, wherein only

the respectively higher pressure from the control line (12) and the load
pressure signalling line (15) is transferred by the change-over valve (13)

by way of a further control line (24) to the spring chamber (14) of the
pressure scale device (11).
Control which is independent of load pressure in respect of the
speed of hydraulic control elements such as cylinders (3), hydraulic motors

(28) or the like, in relation to leading loads on building machines such as
for example wheel loaders, excavators, graders or the like, comprising at

least one pump (17) with a delivery volume which is variable by a regulator
(16), for delivering a pressure fluid from a tank (9), and at least one spool

valve (4) having at least one control spool (5) for actuation of the control 
element or elements, wherein a pressure scale device (11) is fitted into the

line between the outlet (25) of the control spool (5) and the tank (9),
wherein the return region of the control spool (5) is in the form of a

differential pressure orifice (8) and wherein the pressure before the oil flow
passes through the differential pressure orifice (8) can be transferred by

way of a line (29) on to the side (27) of the pressure scale device (11),
which is remote from the spring
 chamber (14), characterised in that there
are provided a control line (26) for taking off the pressure after the

differential pressure orifice (8) and a load pressure signalling line (15) for
taking off the load pressure produced by the pump (17), the control line

and the load pressure signalling line each leading to a common change-over
valve (13), wherein only the respectively higher pressure from the

control line (26) and the load pressure signalling line (15) is transferred by
the change-over valve (13) by way of a control line (24) to the spring

chamber (14) of the pressure scale device (11).
A control according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised by a make-up
feed valve (19) which is provided in the region of the pressure fluid feed

line (20') and which fills the annular chamber (18) of the control element
which is in the form of a cylinder (3) or feeds the hydraulic motor (28)

which has become a pump.
