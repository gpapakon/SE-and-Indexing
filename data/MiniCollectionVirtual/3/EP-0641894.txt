<ABSTRACT>
The sweeping brush (1) is fixed to a pivotable cantilever (8) by means of a rotatable arm (2). A drive means (7) effects the pivoting movement of the cantilever (8). Through a chain wheel (3a) coupled to the arm (2) and a chain (4) the pivoting of the cantilever (8) causes a rotation of the arm (2). In this way, the sweeping brush (1) can be positioned by a drive means in a simple way both transversely to the travelling direction and in the travelling direction of the cleaning apparatus (11).

<CLAIMS>
Sweeping device mounted on a sweeping vehicle 
where at least one sweeping broom can be brought 

into different working positions, the broom being mounted 
at one end of an arm (2) and the other end of the arm (2) 

is rotatably fixed to a boom (8) that can be swivelled by 
means of a drive (7), and where the position of the broom 

relative to the boom (8) can be regulated by means of just 
this one drive (7) both in the direction of the path of 

the vehicle and transversally to this direction through 
the action of a mechanical transmission (3a, 4) which 

acts on the arm and derives a rotation of the arm (2) 
from a swivelling motion of the boom (8), characterized 

in that the transmission consists of a toothed wheel (3a) 
mounted on the arm and a chain (4) or a toothed belt 

which loops around the toothed wheel and the extremities 
of which are fixed at a certain distance from the swivelling 

axis. 
Sweeping device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the sweeping broom is maintained 

resiliently so as to go into a dodging position independently 
of the action of the drive when the broom 

encounters an obstacle. 
Sweeping device according to one of claims 
1 or 2, characterized in that the sweeping broom is a 

rotatable dish-shaped broom (1; 1'). 
Sweeping device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the extremities of the chain or of 

the toothed belt, respectively, are attached to a base 
plate (5) that carries the boom (8). 
Sweeping device according to claim 4, 
characterized in that each extremity of the chain is 

attached by means of an extensible spring (6, 6a).
