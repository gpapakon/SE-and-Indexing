<ABSTRACT>
In a brush seal adapted for use in disturbed fluid flow 
conditions the upstream side-plate is formed of porous 

material or has foraminate region. In conventional 
seals disturbed flow can generate a flow adjacent the 

face of the seal bristle pack which tends to lift 
bristles away from the second sealing element. Seal 

leakage is consequently increased. The foraminate or 
porous upstream side-plate reduces disturbing forces on 

the bristles by modifying flow patterns to avoid forces 
which lift the bristles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a brush seal. In particular, it concerns 
an improvement in the design of a brush seal to reduce leakage 
through a seal bounding a region of disturbed fluid flow. Brush seals are employed to seal gaps between relatively movable 
components, especially rotating components as, for example in the 
internal air cooling system of a gas turbine engine, to prevent or 
at least substantially reduce leaking of cooling air. Excessive 
use of internal cooling air directly degrades engine efficiency and 
increases specific fuel consumption. The seals may be used as a 
gas or liquid seal, for example in an engine application it may be 
used as an oil or air seal. There is known from our earlier UK Patent No 1,450,553 a brush seal 
of this type comprising a mass of metallic bristles sandwiched 
between a pair of annular side-plates. The bristles are integrally 
joined with the side-plates and angled in the direction of relative 
rotation of the two sealing elements. International publication W092/14951 also discloses brush seal 
assembly comprising two rows of bristles, the bristles of the first 
row being short than those of the second row and having greater 
stiffness. Our UK Patent No 1,598,926 describes a brush seal provided with 
side-plates on the upstream and downstream sides of the bristles 
which extend for almost the full depth of the bristles. The 
bristles project a minimum length beyond the plates, with a 
circumferential component of direction, and make rubbing contact 
with a co-operating surface to provide a fluid seal. It is 
important that the bristles retain their flexibility so that they 
are able to track lateral shaft movement and maintain good sealing. 
Therefore the side-plates do not squeeze the bristles too tightly  
 
so that each bristle is free to bend but this also exposes bristles 
at the pack face to influence from disturbing flows. In this prior 
patent at least one of the side-plates is relieved on its bristle-contacting 
face over a sufficient distance from one edge to allow 
freedom for the bristles to move. In addition a gap is provided 
under the side-plates just equal to the clearance needed between 
the side-plates and the co-operating sealing surface, to take into 
account tolerances for manufacture, differential thermal expansion 
and permissible eccentricity of rotation. Brush seals are designed for a controlled leakage flow through the 
bristle pack (amongst other reasons to cool the bristles) and this 
flow rate is determined by pressure

<CLAIMS>
A brush seal (2) comprising a mass of bristles (8) packed together between 
a pair of side plates (10, 12), the bristles (8) being joined to the side 

plates (10, 12) and having free ends for co-operating with a further member (4) 
to form a seal thereagainst, the side-plates (10,12) being handed for use 

between regions having a fluid pressure differential wherein the 
side-plate (10) which, in use, faces the higher pressure region, 

includes a foraminate region, characterised in that said foraminate 
region of the side-plate (10) occupies at least a region towards the 

inner periphery of the side-plate, and in that the level of porosity 
lies within a range from about 16% and up to about 40% wherein the 

porosity calculation is based on the surface area of the said 
side-plate (10) which is in fluid flow contact with the bristles (8). 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 1 wherein the foraminate region 
of the one side-plate (10) occupies at least a region towards the free 

ends of the bristles (8). 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the side-plates 
(10,12) are spaced apart by the thickness of the bristle layer (8). 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein at least the 
foraminate region of the one side-plate (10) is spaced apart from an 

adjacent face of the packed bristles (8). 
A brush seal as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 
foraminate region of the side-plate (10) has a porosity measurement in a range of up to about 

40%. 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 5 wherein in the foraminate 
region has a porosity measurement of about 16%. 
A brush seal as claimed in any preceding claim wherein one side-plate 
comprises a solid member (10)  

 
pierced by a multiplicity of holes (24). 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 7 wherein in an 
annular brush seal the one side-plate (10) comprises an 

annular member and the multiplicity of holes (24) are 
formed therein in a concentric array. 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 8 wherein the 
array of holes (24) are distributed around a plurality 

of concentric pitch circles. 
A brush seal as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 
wherein at least the foraminate region of the one 

side-plate is formed of porous material (30). 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 10 wherein said 
porous material (30) consists of a honeycombed material. 
A brush seal as claimed in claim 10 or claim 11 
wherein the whole of said one side-plate is formed 

of the porous material (30).
