<ABSTRACT>
This pressurised double glazing comprises, in the usual fashion, two glass panels (1, 2) mounted in parallel on a support frame (3, 4) and trapping a volume of air (15) between them in substantially hermetic fashion. In accordance with the invention, it includes a means (9) for supplying with pressurised air the volume (15) which separates the glass panels, and a means (11, 12) for removing this pressurised air.

Pressurised double glazing unit, comprising two panes 
of glass (1, 2) mounted in parallel on a supporting frame (3, 

4) and trapping substantially tightly between them a quantity 
of air (15), this double glazing unit being characterised in 

that it comprises a means (9) of supplying compressed air to 
the space (15) separating the panes of glass and an 

evacuation means (11, 12) for this compressed air, such that 
when these means are in operation the rate of supply of 

compressed air to this space (15) is between 1 and 100 l/hr 
and the pressure of the air is between 0 and 5000 Pa, and in 

that it comprises a means for bringing the space (15) 
separating the panes (1, 2) into controlled communication 

with the outside, said means comprising a nozzle with a very 
small diameter communicating with the outside. 
A pressurised double glazing unit according to claim 
1, characterised in that said means (16) of communication 

with the outside, communicating with the external 
environment, opens via a connection (17) in a closed space 

(18) in a supporting frame (3, 4), itself in communication 
via an orifice (19) of several tenths of a millimetre with 

the external ambient atmosphere and provided with a filtering 
element. 
A pressurised double glazing unit according to either 
one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that said compressed 

air supply and evacuation means comprise two ducts (9, 11) 
connected respectively with a source of clean dry air and 

with an evacuation collector and each opening into the space 
(15) which separates the two panes of glass (1, 2) via a 

nozzle with an orifice of very small diameter. 
A pressurised double glazing unit according to any 
one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it  

 
comprises, in the space (15) separating the panes (1, 2) or 

in an auxiliary space in contact with this space (15), a 
quantity of a hygroscopic product which is at least 

sufficient to absorb the moisture trapped in the space (15) 
separating the panes (1, 2) at the time of construction of 

the double glazing unit.
