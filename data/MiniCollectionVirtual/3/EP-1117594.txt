<DESCRIPTION>
 PACKAGING DEVICE FOR ATTACHMENT OF CLIPS TO A CONTINUOUSLY MOVING TUBE OF CASINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to apparatus for attachment of U-shaped metal clips to a tube of flexible casing material which has been filled with a viscous product. The apparatus applies clips to the casing as the filled casing product is moving. The invention further relates to a mechanism for attaching metal clips to casing at intervals along the casing thereby sealing product within the casing in the form of separate links as the filled casing is moving continuously.Various food products, such as sausage or cheese, are packaged in flexible, tubular casing by attaching metal clips to the filled casing at spaced intervals thereby sealing and closing the product within the casing. Klenz, Patent No. 3,383,754 issued May 21, 1968, incorporated herewith by reference, discloses a device adapted for applying U-shaped metal clips about casing. Klenz discloses the use of a punch for driving a U-shaped metal clip through a channel against a die to form the clip about filled and gathered casing material aligned between the punch and the die. Klenz, U.S. Patent No. 3,543,378 discloses the use of a pair of clippers arranged in tandem and cooperative with opposed, moveable, casing gathering plates defining a pair of clip channels. The gathering plates move in opposition to each other to gather filled casing material into a constricted form. Two U-shaped metal clips are then driven in channels defined by the gathering plates by punches about the gathered material to seal the ends of adjacent links of the casing. A knife then cuts the casing between the clips to separate the links defined by the clipped casing. Other patents disclose various combinations of gathering mechanisms for gathering casing prior to attachment of the clip or clips, including Klenz Patent No. 3,583,506; Dobbert, U.S. Patent No. 3,783583; and Velarde, Patent No. 4,001,926.Various mechanisms have been suggested for improving the efficiency and speed of operation of clipping mechanisms when forming links of product in a continuous or assembly 

line operation. Andre, Patent No. 3,795,058 discloses a single clipper mounted at a work station of rotating table. The table moves intermittently from station to station between operations performed at each station, including a clip attachment station. Andre, Patent No. 4,578,928 discloses a circular table wherein filled casing material is transported from station to station for ultimate attachment of the

CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for attaching a shaped metal clip at intervals to casing filled with a viscous product, said apparatus comprising, in combination: a support frame; a clipper assembly; a clipper assembly mounting rail for reciprocally mounting the clipper assembly on the frame for reciprocal movement back and forth between a first casing entry station and a second casing exit station, a continuous filled tube of casing entering the apparatus at the first station, exiting at the second station and clipped intermediate the first and second station by the reciprocating clipper assembly; a clipper assembly reciprocation mechanism for reciprocating the clipper assembly on the rail between the first and second stations; said clipper assembly including a filled casing support passage through which filled casing is directed as said casing extends between the first and second station, said clipper assembly further including first and second casing gathering plates which are projectible into the passage to gather the filled casing to form a neck section therein for attachment of at least one clip about the casing, said clipper assembly further including a clipper mechanism for attachment of a clip about gathered casing; and a control mechanism for the apparatus to synchronously operate the reciprocation mechanism with movement of casing between the first and second stations and to simultaneously operate the gathering plates and clipper sequentially only during synchronous movement of the clipper assembly from the first to the second station, and otherwise for release and disengagement of the plates and clipper, whereby filled casing is continuously moving through the apparatus and gathered and clipped during said movement but only when the clipper assembly is synchronously moving therewith.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 including first and second sets of gathering plates, said first and second set spaced from one another in the direction of casing travel and including a mechanism for separating the first and second set of plates for access of the clipper to gathered casing therebetween for attachment of a clip. 

3. The apparatus of claim 2 further including a double clipper for attaching spaced clips to the gathered casing between the sets of plates.
4. The apparatus of claim 3 further including a cutting mechanism in the clipper assembly for cutting clipped casing between spaced clips.
