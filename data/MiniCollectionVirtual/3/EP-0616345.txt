<ABSTRACT>
A keytop sheet of a push-button switch includes a 
keytop, which is made of synthetic resin, molded on a 

sheet of resin film. The film sheet surrounding the 
portion thereof on which the keytop is molded is 

provided with a curved projection protruding in a 
downward and/or upward direction from the surface of the 

film sheet. 
In another aspect, the curved projection is 
replaced by providing the film sheet surrounding the 

portion thereof on which the keytop is molded with a 
cut-out while leaving a portion remaining to form a 

hinge portion, and a nameplate provided with a hole 
shaped so that the keytop may be passed therethrough is 

attached to the film sheet so as to cover the cut-out 
and hinge portion of the film sheet. 
In a further aspect, a keytop sheet of a push-button 
switch includes a sheet of resin film in the 

interior of which a keytop made of synthetic resin is 
molded, a nameplate mounted on the film sheet and having 

an outer diameter greater than that of the film sheet, 
and a frame made of synthetic resin fixed to an 

underside of the film sheet on an outer peripheral 
portion thereof. The outer peripheral portion of the 

nameplate is bent and fixed to an outer peripheral side 
surface of the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keytop sheet for push-button 
switches capable of being reduced in size and 
thickness and suited to integration, 
according to the preamble of claims 1 and 2 (EP-A-483 898). The reduction in the size and thickness of 
electronic devices that has been achieved in recent 
years has been accompanied by a demand to reduce the 
size and thickness also of the keytop sheet for the 
push-button switches used on the control panels of these 
devices. In an effort to meet this demand, a keytop sheet 
has been proposed in EP-A-483 898 in which a plurality of keytops made 
of synthetic resin are fixedly molded in the interior of 
a film sheet comprising a single film made of resin, and 
a frame made of synthetic resin is fixedly molded to the 
periphery of the film sheet so as to encircle the 
plurality of keytops. A switch contact is disposed below each keytop so 
that if the keytop is pressed, the switch underlying it 
will be closed. At such time the film sheet surrounding 
the keytop is tensioned slightly in the downward 
direction. These push-button switches using a keytop sheet of 
this kind include some that are used in environments in 
which there is the danger of humidity and moisture 
penetrating the interior of the switch. In such case, 
there are instances in which it is preferred that the 
keytop sheet have a so-called waterproof structure in 
which humidity and moisture will not penetrate the 
underside of the sheet from the top side thereof. To 
achieve this, it is required that the film sheet be 
entirely devoid of holes. When the conventional keytop sheet of EP-A-483 898 is such that the  
 
spacing between the keytops and the frame or the spacing 
between the keytops themselves is reduced for the sake 
of miniaturization, the following problems arise: Specifically, Fig. 20 is a diagram showing the 
relationship among an angle of inclination A of a film 
sheet 210, L and ΔL, where L represents the spacing 
between a keytop 220 and a frame 230 to which a film 
sheet 210 has been affixed, and ΔL represents the amount 
by which the film sheet 210 must stretch when the keytop 
220 is depressed by 0.3 mm. As indicated by the graph of Fig. 20, the smaller 
the spacing L, the much greater the amount of stretch ΔL 
and the angle of inclination A. In other words, the 
smaller the spacing L is made, the more difficult it is 
to depress the keytop 220. If the keytop 220 is pressed 
too strongly in such case, there is the danger that the 
film sheet 210 will be deformed. Further,

A keytop sheet (10; 10-2; 10-3; 10-4; 10-5) of a 
push-button switch in which a keytop (50; 50-2; 50-3; 50-4; 

50-5) arranged above a switch contact (68) and having an 
underside provided with a pushing portion (51) for opening 

and closing the switch contact by pressing it is molded at a 
prescribed position on a film sheet (20; 20-2; 20-3; 20-4; 

20-5; 20-A; 20-B; 20-8) comprising a resin film, 
characterized 
in that
 said film sheet (20; 20-2; 20-3; 20-4; 20-5;
