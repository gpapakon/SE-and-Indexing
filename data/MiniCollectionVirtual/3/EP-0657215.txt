<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a stack (10) of a 
plurality of substantially identical cup-like vessels 

(20) pre-incorporated with reagent on the inside, each 
of the vessels (20) occupying at least 50% of the 

depth of the next adjacent vessel to maximize stacking 
density. Because the pre-incorporated reagent 

overlaps the occupied depth portion of the vessel and 
therefore runs a risk of being dislodged, the wall of 

the vessel is constructed to provide a gap (X‚ÇÅ) 
between the inside surface (26) bearing the reagent, 

and the outside surface (28) of the occupying, nested 

vessel, which is at least 0.025mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reaction
vessels and is more particularly concerned with such
vessels which are constructed to be stacked without
damaging the coating of reagents inside.Reaction vessels have long been provided
with pre-incorporated reagents. Some have even been
constructed so as to be stackable, one above the
other, as shown in, for example, US-A-4 761 378.
However, those described in US-A-4 761 378 are so
stacked without the vessels actually nesting within
each other.On the other hand, it is known to actually
nest reaction vessels within each other, as shown in a
wet assay analyzer described in US-A-4 260 581.
However, these are nestable because there is no pre-incorporated
reagent -- the latter is added as a
liquid during assay.In fact, nesting reaction vessels together
with pre-incorporated reagent is especially difficult
when more than 50% of the vessel height is nested in
the adjacent vessel. The reason is that, unless care
is taken, the vessel inside and above can mechanically
wear off the reagent in the "outer" vessel below,
especially during shipment and storage. The fact that
more than 50% of the vessel height is nested increases
this likelihood.US-A-5 271 896 discloses,
but does not claim, nested reaction cuvettes containing
pre-incorporated reagents. Spacing between nested
cuvettes is not described.FR-2588528 discloses a container for transporting
biopsy samples with a collar preventing
stacked cups from jamming, and a lid. This invention solves the problem of how to nest vessels whose inside
surfaces do not lend themselves to the nesting principle since they are pre-incorporated
with reagent.In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention there is
provided a method of preventing the dislodging of reagents pre-incorporated as a
coating on the inside surface of reaction vessels, each of the vessels having a cup
shape with an open top and an inside surface forming a closed bottom, comprising
the steps of:
(a) providing each vessel with an outside surface effective to nest the
vessel partially within an adjacent vessel so that each vessel occupies more than
50% of the depth of the adjacent vessel, as measured from the open top;(b) nesting vessels within an adjacent vessel so that the outside surface is
spaced from the inside surface of the adjacent vessel by a distance which is at
least 0.025mm; and
thereafter dispensing a vessel from the nest one at a time.In accordance with another preferred aspect of the present invention, there
is provided a stack comprising

<CLAIMS>
A method of preventing the dislodging of reagents pre-incorporated as a coating
on the inside surface of reaction vessels (20), each of the vessels (20) having a cup

shape with an open top (22) and an inside surface (26) forming a closed bottom (30),
comprising the steps of:


(a) providing each vessel with an outside surface (28) effective to nest the

vessel (20) partially within an adjacent vessel so that each vessel (20) occupies more
than 50% of the depth of the adjacent vessel, as measured from the open top (22);
(b) nesting vessels within an adjacent vessel so that the outside surface (28) is
spaced from the inside surface (26) of the adjacent vessel by a distance which is at least

0.025mm; and

thereafter dispensing a vessel from the nest one at a time.
A stack (10) comprising a plurality of reaction vessels (20), each of the vessels
(20) having a cup shape with an open top (22) and an inside surface (26) forming a

closed bottom (30), and each comprising:

an outside surface (28) effective to nest the vessel (20) partially within an
adjacent vessel; and
a reagent pre-incorporated onto the inside surface (26) of each vessel (20) at that
portion of the inside surface disposed adjacent the bottom (30) of each vessel (20);

characterised in that:
the outside surface (28) is effective to nest the vessel (20) so that each vessel
(70) occupies more than 50% of the depth of the adjacent vessel as measured from the

open top (22); and
the portion of each vessel (20) which is nested within the adjacent vessel being
spaced from the inside surface of the adjacent vessel by a distance which is at least

0.025mm.
A stack according to claim 2, wherein the reagent is an antibody immobilized on
the inside surface (26).
