<ABSTRACT>
The game includes a game board and two series of pieces for two players. The game board may be that of the "tank" or "hopscotch" game, including a network of lines each having three locations for a piece, in which each player attempts to place three pieces in line in order to have the right to take a piece from his opponent. The game is improved in that each piece (30) bears a number (34) representing the value of the piece, which makes it possible to allocate points to the winner on the basis of the values of the pieces taken from his opponent. In a version intended for blind people or for the visually handicapped, the same number (24) is written (at 32) in Braille, on the head (31) of the piece.
