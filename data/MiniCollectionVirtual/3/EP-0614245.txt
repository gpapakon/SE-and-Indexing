<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active phased
array antenna for radiating both microwave and thermal energy,
comprising a plurality of subarray elements, each subarray
element comprising: heat generating means including electronic
circuit means comprising a plurality of electronic components
including an RF amplifying means for generating radio frequency
energy, housing means formed of heat conducting material, means
mounting said circuit means in heat conducting relationship
with said housing means, RF probe means connected with said
electronic circuit means, said housing means including an opening
for receiving said RF probe means; a lower panel assembly of
heat conducting material; and a circuit board.Such an antenna is e.g. known from European patent
application EP-A-0 476 675.This document discloses an array backplate incorporating
the thermal cooling structure and the signal processing
structure together in one unified structure. Several active
modules are mounted to the backplate and provided with coupling
means including thermal vias and solder bumps.Further, European patent application EP-A-0 448 318
discloses the use of heat pipes for removing heat from an
electronics module in an array antenna. The heat pipes are
provided in a base which serves as structural support for the
module. U.S. patent US 4,998,181 is concerned with a system
for cooling, positioning and supporting phased array microwave
modules within a phased array radar system wherein the modules
are disposed in cooling tubes, the cooling tubes being arranged
to permit coolant to continuously pass in close proximity thereto
along channels formed in a coldplate.In view of the above, the present invention relates
to phased array antennas and, more particularly, to a lightweight
active phased array antenna that permits efficient radiation
of microwave energy as well as efficient radiation of thermal
energy in the presence of sunlight.For commercial communications satellite applications,
active phased array payloads require more bias power and
dissipate more thermal energy than conventional payloads.
Therefore, they require a very lightweight structure to offset
the weight increase in the power supply needed to produce the
same effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). The active phased
array must also radiate RF and thermal energy efficiently to
maintain reasonable array areas and surface temperatures.Therefore, it is an object of the present invention
to provide an active phased array antenna of the type mentioned
at the outset
