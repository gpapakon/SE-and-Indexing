<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an antenna which is capable of cancelling 
long field noise. The antenna is split in to an even number of portions, for 

example 2, 4, 6, etc., and half of the portions are phase rotated, typically by 
180° relative to the other halves of the portions. The long field noise 

intercepted by the antenna is essentially cancelled by the antenna 
arrangement. In addition the signal to noise ratio is dramatically improved 

when compared with that of the prior cut antennae.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for cancelling noise 
in antennae and the like. Antennae [of all sorts] suffer from the problem that they pick up long 
distance noise which can interfere with the signal that the antennae is 
supposed to pick up. In this specification antennae is intended to include all 
types of antennae, such as for example, relatively inefficient antennae which 
comprise merely a loop of wire. When an antenna picks up this long distance noise it is necessary to 
find a way of removing the noise and improving the signal to noise ratio. 
Generally the problem is handled by signal processing the received signals in 
the signal processing circuits of the antennae system. The handling of noise 
in the signal processing circuits can often result in lowering of the sensitivity 
of the system ie: reduced signal to noise ratio. In addition some knowledge of 
the nature of the noise is often required to ensure accurate compensation for 
the noise. One object of the present invention is to overcome at least some of the 
problems and disadvantages of known solutions and to provide a solution in 
which the signal to noise ratio of the antenna is optimised. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an 
antenna system having improved noise cancelling properties comprising an 
antenna which is split into an even number of equal portions, wherein one 
half of the portions are phase rotated relative to the other half of the 
portions. This has the advantage that the effect of the long field noise is 
cancelled out by the antenna but the effect of near field noise or signal is not. 
This ensures good signal to noise ratio. Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:  Figure 1 is a schematic view of a known standard gate antenna; Figure 2 is a side view of the figure 1 antenna showing a source 
of interest and two noise sources; Figure 3 is a schematic view of a balanced antenna according to 
one aspect of the present invention; Figure 4 is a side view of the figure 3 antenna showing a source 
of interest and two noise sources; Figures 5a to 5d are isofield diagrams for both the standard 
antenna and the balanced antenna; and Figure 6 is an alternative embodiment of an antenna according 
to another aspect of the present invention. A basic antenna 10 as is shown in figure 1, suffers badly from the 
effect of long distant noise. Refering to figure 2, the antenna 10 receives 
two noise signals 20, 22 from distance noise
