<ABSTRACT>
Binary information of input signal obtained from positions separated 
spatially or in point of time, e.g. image pick-up signals from an image sensor, can 

be obtained with high accuracy by a simple circuit configuration. A circuit therefor 
can be implemented as on-chip configuration within the image sensor. A first 

comparator (31a) set so that a potential on the + terminal is caused to be higher 
than a potential on the - terminal by voltage V1, a second comparator (31b) set so 

that a potential on the + terminal is caused to be lower than a potential on - 
terminal by voltage V2, and a JK flip-flop circuit (32) are arranged. One of two 

signal output sections (25a, 25b) having quantities of delays different from each 
other of the final stage in charge transfer section is connected to respective + 

terminals of the two comparators, the other signal output section is connected to 
respective - terminals of the two comparators, inverting Q terminal of the first 

comparator and J terminal of JK flip-flop circuit are connected, and Q terminal of 
the second comparator and K terminal of JK flip-flop circuit are connected. Thus, 

binary circuit suitable for, e.g., binarization of output information of an image 
sensor of a CCD image pick-up apparatus for a bar code reader is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a CCD solid-state image pick-up apparatus
provided with a binary circuit applied to binarization of an input signal, and more
particularly with a binary circuit adapted to output image pick-up signals obtained
(sampled) from spatially separated positions of an object to be imaged as a binary
signal. Especially, the CCD image pick-up apparatus provided with such a binary
circuit is suitable when used as a bar code reader adapted for reading a mark such
as a bar code, etc. attached on a medium to convert it into a binary signal.Generally, bar codes are adapted to indicate information such as name of
manufacturer (maker) or name of goods, etc. on a medium, etc. by combination
of lines of different thicknesses, and such bar codes are read by an optical
detecting method and are utilized for aggregate (sum total) of the amount sold of
goods or analysis of circulation thereof, etc.As an apparatus for reading bar codes by the optical detecting method, a
CCD image sensor is mainly used. Namely, an output from the CCD image
sensor is delivered to a binary circuit to take out combination of lines of different
thicknesses as binary information to detect the binary information thus taken out
as bar code information. In this case, there is generally employed a method of
obtaining binary information while comparing a level (voltage) of an image pick-up
signal with a threshold voltage at a comparator.However, in binarization of an output from the CCD image sensor, since
reflection of a print surface of the bar code does not become uniform by the
influence of unevenness of the surface of a medium on which bar codes are
printed, or an extraneous light, it is difficult to allow output data to be binary
information (i.e., binarize output data ) while maintaining the threshold voltage at
a fixed value. For this reason, in the prior art, a circuit adapted for inverting a
current image pick-up signal when a change of the signal level more than a
predetermined absolute value takes place relative to an image pick-up signal
immediately before, is made up outside the CCD image sensor.A conventional bar code reader will now be described with reference to
Fig. 1. A CCD image sensor constituting this bar code reader includes an image 
pick-up region 2 where a large number of light receiving portion 1 for converting
an incident light into a signal charge quantity corresponding to a light quantity
thereof are arranged, and a charge transfer section 3 for unidirectionally
transferring signal charges from the
