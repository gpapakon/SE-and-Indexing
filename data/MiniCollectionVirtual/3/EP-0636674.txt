<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal decomposition
apparatus for plastics according to the preamble of claim
1.FR-A-2 176 776 discloses a thermal decomposition apparatus
for plastics of this kind, wherein plastics are melted and
thermally decomposed, and the resulting decomposition gas
is cooled for condensation and recovered in the form of a
thermal decomposition oil. The apparatus comprises a reactor
for melting and thermally decomposing the plastics
therein, and an extraneous matter discharge duct having one
end opened in a melt of plastics within the reactor,
through which extraneous matter within the reactor together
with the melt of plastics might be sucked into a collecting
container. Moreover, there is provided a rotatable vertical
shaft carrying at its lower end portion agitating blades
for stirring the melt in the reactor. The agitating blades
are provided underneath the opening of the extraneous matter
discharge duct and in radial direction quite short, in
order not to interfere with the extraneous matter discharge
duct. Thus, the agitating blades are comparatively small
and accordingly their effect is sometimes considered not to
be sufficient. Moreover, since the opening of the extraneous
matter discharge duct is positioned above the agitating
blades, it is difficult to remove extraneous matter which
accumulates at the bottom of the reactor.It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a
thermal decomposition apparatus of the known kind enabling
good performance of the agitating blades and also removal 
of material in the lower portion near the bottom of the reactor.According to the invention this object is solved in that
the rotary shaft is hollow and the discharge duct is partly
disposed inside the rotary shaft such that the open end of
the discharge duct is immersed in the melt of plastics below
the agitating blades.In other words, according to the invention the discharge
duct is not provided outside the rotary shaft as in the
prior art device, but instead it is disposed inside the rotary
shaft. Due to this arrangement it is ensured, that the
agitating blades fixedly mounted on the rotary shaft can
not interfere with the extraneous matter discharge duct, so
that the agitating blades can be relatively large and accordingly
the agitating effect of the blades considerably
increased.Moreover, the provision of the extraneous matter discharge
duct within the rotary shaft offers the possibility for the
discharge duct to extend to a portion of the reactor underneath
the plane of
