<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information processing
apparatus, information processing method, and providing medium. More
particularly, it relates to an information processing apparatus,
information processing method, and providing medium that utilize
encrypted information.There are systems that encrypt information (hereafter referred
to as content) such as music and send it to the information processing
apparatus of the users who have made a required agreement, so that the
users can decrypt and use the content on their information processing
apparatus.If a user possesses two or more information processing apparatus,
he/she must buy content and pay its usage charge for each information
processing apparatus. Even if content has been bought once, it must
be bought again for the same charge if it is to be used on (bought for)
a different information processing apparatus. The present invention has been made in view of the above
circumstances. It allows the user to buy the same content again at
discount prices.To solve these problems, the present invention provides an
information processing apparatus which comprises first preparation
means for preparing first usage control status which identifies first
usage details describing purchased rights and the pricing details
corresponding to the first usage details; storage means for storing
the encrypted information, the first usage control status, a usage
control policy that contains a second use type that describe the rights
that can be purchased again based on the details of the purchased rights,
price tags that contain the pricing details corresponding to the second
usage details, and the key needed to decrypt the encrypted information;
second preparation means for preparing second usage control status
which identifies the second usage details and the pricing details
corresponding to the second usage details, based on the usage control
policy and price tags, when rights are purchased again through another
information processing apparatuses; and sending means for sending the
second usage control status prepared by the second preparation means
as well as the encrypted information and the key stored on the storage
means to the other information processing apparatuses.Also, the present invention provides an information processing
method which comprises a first preparation step of preparing the first
usage control status which identifies the first usage details 
describing the purchased rights and the pricing details corresponding
to the first usage details; a
