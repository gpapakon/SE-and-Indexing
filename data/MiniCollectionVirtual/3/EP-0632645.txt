<ABSTRACT>
In a method for generating a data record for reproducing a pattern on a web of endless fabric, basic colours (F1, F2, F3) are initially applied lying above one another in different proportional amounts of colour (a1, a2, a3) in each case predetermined raster areas (16) on a sample of the web of endless fabric. Then the individual raster areas (16) are colorimetrically measured in order to determine the colour correction values dependent on the proportional amounts of colour (a1, a2, a3). This is followed by a point-by-point colorimetric measuring of the pattern in order to obtain in each case colour values of the pattern. The colour values determined are corrected by the colour correction values in order to obtain corrected proportional amounts of colour for each point of the pattern. These corrected proportional amounts of colour are stored and can be used at a later time for defining hole sizes in screen printing stencils for reproducing the pattern, for example, in correspondence therewith.
