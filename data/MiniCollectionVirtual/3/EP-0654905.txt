<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photo-receiver apparatus
and to methods for generating output signals from
optical input signals.As photonics becomes more widely used in
communications equipment, the performance characteristics
of optoelectronic circuit elements must be improved.
There are several prior art optical receiver circuit
designs in existence. Such circuits receive optical input
beams and generate output signals which take the form of
either electrical signals or regenerated optical signals.One prior art design is an optoelectric receiver
circuit which is a field-effect transistor (FET)
implementation of a high impedance receiver. Another
prior art approach involves utilizing an FET
implementation of a transimpedance receiver. Both the
high input impedance receiver and the transimpedance
receiver have some serious disadvantages. For example,
when single light beams are used, a resistor is often
employed in these prior art receivers, and this resistor
fixes the bandwidth of the receiver. Further, because
there is always some static current flow through the FETs
of these receiver designs, electrical energy is dissipated
or wasted. Yet further, since only one input beam is
used, the power level of that beam must be of sufficient
intensity so that the receiver can distinguish between
logic states. In addition, a passive pull-up load causes
a slow down in output switching.According to one aspect of this invention
there is
provided photo-receiver apparatus as claimed in claim 1.According to another aspect of this invention there is
provided a method as claimed in claim 14. A first exemplary embodiment of the present invention is a
complementary field-effect transistor (CFET) optical
receiver having first and second photo-diodes connected in
series in a loop having a first node between them, and
third and fourth photo-diodes connected in series having a
second node between them. First and second field-effect
transistors (FETs) are connected together in series, and
the gate of the first FET is connected to the first node
while the gate of the second FET is connected to the
second node. The output of the CFET optical receiver is
taken from a third node between the first and second FETs.During operation, the CFET receiver utilizes four
input light beams, two of which are unique. A first input
beam is duplicated into two beams which are simultaneously
incident on the first and fourth photo-diodes, and a
complementary input beam is duplicated into two beams
which are incident on the second and third
