<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to planar optical devices and, more particularly, to
arrangements for pumping integrated arrays of such devices.A variety of optical devices made in the form of planar optical waveguides are
known. Multiple such devices can be fabricated in an integrated fashion on a
substrate to provide a microminiature component that is useful in optical signal
processing networks.An advantageous planar device that functions as an optical amplifier is described
in U.S. Patent No. 5,119,460. The device described therein amplifies optical
signals by stimulated emission from erbium ions. Erbium ions are excited to a lasing
level by coupling pumping radiation into an active erbium-doped region of the device.In accordance with the teachings of the aforecited patent, signal and pumping
radiation are combined and then injected into the active region of each device (see,
for example, FIG. 2 of the patent). For large integrated arrays made on a single
substrate, such device-by-device pumping can obviously lead to complicated topologies
and difficult routing problems.Accordingly, efforts have continued by workers skilled in the art directed at
trying to improve the structural arrangement of planar optical amplifiers in an
integrated array. In particular, these efforts have been directed at trying to devise a
more effective way of pumping the amplifiers. It was recognized that these efforts, if
successful, could lead to more compact and lower-cost integrated arrays for use in
optical signal processing networks. In JP-A-2222186, [see Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, No. 524 (E-1003),
November 16, 1990], a waveguide laser array is described. As shown, for example, in
Figure 1 thereof, plural waveguides 9-1, 9-2, 9-3 and 9-4 of a resonator array 6 are
simultaneously pumped from a single source by light 7. In that way, plural laser outputs
characterized by uniformity are provided.In EP-A-0 404 152, a single pumping laser diode 38 and connecting
optical fiber sections 68, 70 are employed to pump two doped fibers 10, 10' (see, for
example, FIG. 16 thereof). The sections 68, 70 are coupled to the fibers 10, 10' via
plural multiplexer/demultiplexer units 34, 34', 46, 46'. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, plural planar optical
amplifiers in an integrated array are simultaneously pumped by a single pumping
source. In any case, the number of pumping sources in the array is smaller than the
number of amplifiers to be pumped. In one embodiment, the pumping arrangement
comprises a single
