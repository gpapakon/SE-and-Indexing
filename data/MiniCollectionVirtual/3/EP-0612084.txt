<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing a flexible coil construction which 
can form part of an electronic circuit as an electromagnetic 

antenna. In this flexible coil construction, the insulated 
wire for the turns of the coil is provided with a coating 

which has the property that no bond develops at commonly 
prevailing ambient temperatures. A second property is that in 

a first increased temperature range adhesion does occur and a 
third property is that in a second, still higher temperature 

range the adhesive and bonding properties disappear 
substantially through an irreversible structure change and do 

not return upon cooling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a manufacturing system for a 
flexible coil construction which can form part of an 
electronic circuit as an electromagnetic antenna. Such a 
circuit may for instance be fully integrated in a card-shaped 
object, for instance a value document, such as an identity 
card or a smart card. The coil construction, which is mostly 
substantially flat in the case of a card-shaped object, should 
not appreciably, if at all, curtail the normal practical uses 
of the object or the card and should therefore have 
substantially no effect on, for instance, the flexibility 
and/or the flatness thereof. The invention further relates to a method for 
manufacturing a device comprising a flexible coil 
construction, as well as to a flexible coil construction and a 
device comprising a flexible coil construction obtained by the 
method. Applicant's Dutch patent application 92.00835 discloses a 
card construction comprising a flat coil, yielding a product 
in which the coil is eventually present in the card with its 
turns not adhering to each other, so that when the card is 
bent, sufficient flexibility remains present in the coil not 
to cause any permanent deformation. It is sometimes experienced as a drawback of this 
construction that several operations on different constituent 
parts are necessary to arrive at the desired end product. The present invention provides a solution to this problem 
and makes it possible to arrive at a comparable end result 
with a minimum of parts and using simple manufacturing 
techniques. This is achieved by the use of a special adhesive 
system, as will be described in the following. According to 
the state of the art, it is known to wind coils of insulated 
wire, for instance copper wire, provided with a special 
coating which ensures that upon an increase of the temperature 
to approx. 60째 C, for instance, the adjoining turns of the 
coil are stuck to each other.  Such a technique is disclosed, for instance, in US-A-4,048,713. 
The required temperature increase can be 
advantageously realised by passing an electrical current 
through the coil by way of contact clips on the terminal 
portions of the coil, so that the coil is heated to the 
desired temperature. Coils manufactured in this manner will 
not fall apart upon being removed from the winding tool, but 
will retain the shape imparted by the winding former. Thus 
these coils can be processed in the further production process 
in a mechanically stable manner. In order to impart sufficient 
flexibility to an

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a flexible coil construction 
with insulated wire, 

characterised in that a coil whose turns are substantially 
rigidly bonded to each other is used, the turns having been 

bonded to each other using a special coating of which at least 
the rigid bond can be substantially undone by increasing the 

temperature to within a predetermined temperature range; and 
that the coil after being brought into the desired eventual 

position of use is heated to the predetermined temperature 
range. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
special coating is selected such that upon a heating to a 

first, relatively low temperature range a bonding action is 
produced and that upon heating to a second, relatively high 

temperature range the bonding properties disappear 
substantially and substantially do not return upon cooling. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the first, relatively low temperature range is higher than 

room temperature and that a bond which develops upon heating 
to a temperature within the first temperature range is 

substantially retained upon cooling. 
A method according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the heating to the first, relatively low temperature range 

and/or to the second temperature range is obtained by passing 
an electrical current through the coil.

in that the first, relatively low temperature range is between 

approx. 40째 C and approx. 60째 C.

characterised in that the relatively high temperature range is 

above approx. 100째 C. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the coating contains a bonding agent of

A method according to claim 10, characterised in that the 
relatively high temperature range is selected such that it 

corresponds with an increased temperature required for the 
manufacture of the device for different reasons.
