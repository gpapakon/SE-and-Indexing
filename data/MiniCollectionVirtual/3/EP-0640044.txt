<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making 
flexographic printing plates and, in particular, to a 
process for making laser engraved multilayer 
flexographic printing plates and also of concern are 
laser engravable multilayer flexographic printing 
elements. Printing plates are well known for use in 
flexographic printing, particularly on surfaces which 
are corrugated or smooth, such as packaging materials, 
e.g., cardboard, plastic films, etc. Typically, flexographic printing plates which have 
heretofore been used are those made from vulcanized 
rubber. Rubber was favored because it could be used 
with harsh solvents, it had good ink transfer, high 
elasticity, and high compressibility. Rubber elements 
were made by vulcanizing the rubber in a suitable mold. More recently, it has been possible to laser 
engrave a rubber element directly. Laser engraving has 
provided a wide variety of opportunities to rubber 
printing plates. Highly concentrated and controllable 
energy lasers can engrave very fine details in rubber. 
The relief of the printing plate can be varied in many 
ways. Very steep as well as gently decreasing relief 
slopes can be engraved so as to influence the dot gain 
of such plates.  
 Commercial rubbers can be natural or synthetic. An 
example of a synthetic rubber includes ethylene-propylene-diene 
monomer elastomers (EPDM) which can be 
used to make a laser engravable flexographic printing 
element. Elements made from natural or synthetic 
rubbers require vulcanization with sulfur, a sulfur 
containing moiety, or peroxide to effect chemical 
crosslinking. Such crosslinked materials will 
hereinafter be referred to as "rubber". In addition, 
such vulcanized elements require grinding to obtain 
uniform thickness and a smooth surface suitable for 
printing. This is extremely time consuming and labor 
intensive. It has been found that it is possible to make a 
laser engraved single layer, flexographic printing plate 
by a process which comprises: 
(a) reinforcing an elastomeric layer situated on 
top of a flexible support to produce a laser engravable 
flexographic printing element which optionally has a 
removable coversheet situated on top of the elastomeric 
layer, said reinforcement being selected from the group 
consisting of mechanical, photochemical and 
thermochemical, or a combination thereof provided that 
thermochemical reinforcement is accomplished using a 
crosslinker other than sulfur, a sulfur-containing 
moiety, or peroxide; and (b) laser engraving the laser
