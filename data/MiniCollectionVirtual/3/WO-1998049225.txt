<ABSTRACT>
A single or multi-layer microporous material of which at least one layer contains a compatible, melt-processible polymer mixture having a first polymer component with a melting point greater than 140  DEG C and a second polymer component having a melting point lower than 120  DEG C is described as well as a method of preparing the material. The first polymer component and the second polymer component are miscible in a compound or compatible liquid when heated above the melting temperature of the first polymer component or above the liquid-liquid phase separation temperature and phase separate from the compound or compatible liquid when cooled.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE MICROPOROUS FILMField of the Invention This invention relates to a microporous material or film containing a compatible, melt-processible polymer mixture and a method of making the same. The material or film can be used as a single layer or as part of a multi-layer structure and used in articles such as battery separators or temperature indicators.Background of the Invention Porous films made from mixtures of blends of polyolefin materials used as thermal shutdown separators for batteries have been previously described. Depending on the types of polymeric mixtures employed, several disadvantages have been found. For example, porous films made from the use of incompatible polymers result in non-uniform porous structures, thereby limiting their utility. Other porous films employ different grades of the same or miscible polymeric materials but with thermal shutdown temperatures above 125°C. This high shutdown temperature does not provide complete protection against thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. For example, under adiabatic conditions, the thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery with carbon anodes begins at about 120°C. Still other porous films embody mixtures having melting points less than 15°C apart. Temperature surges in excess of 15°C may cause potentially dangerous holes to appear if a lithium battery were to overheat.Summary of the Invention The present invention has solved the disadvantages of the prior porous materials by providing a microporous material containing a compatible, melt- processible polymer mixture in a single layer or a multi-layer system of which this mixture comprises at least one layer. The resulting film exhibits a thermal shutdown well below the point of thermal runaway while still retaining good film-like properties such as resistance to break under stress.Accordingly, the present invention in its first aspect is a microporous material containing a compatible, melt-processable polymer mixture containing: (a) about 15 to 80 parts by weight of a first polymer component having a melting point greater than 140°C, and (b) about 15 to 80 parts by weight of a second polymer component having a melting point lower than 120°C, wherein the first polymer component and the second polymer component are miscible in a compound or compatible liquid when heated above the melting temperature of the first polymer
