<ABSTRACT>
The passenger-carrying system has a plate-like trackway (3, 4) situated at the bottom of an upwardly open U-shaped trackway arrangement (1) capable of being elevated, the legs of the U shape of the trackway arrangement (1) being formed by web-like supports (5, 5'). The running wheels (11) of the vehicles (10) are arranged, in the transverse direction, so close to one another that their joint width - measured over the respective outer surface - does not exceed 2/3, preferably 9/20 of the vehicle width. The vehicles (10) comprise upper and lower guide roller pairs (15, 15', ..., 17, 17', ...) which are arranged offset at a vertical distance from one another and are intended for rolling on the inside (6, 6') of the upwardly directed legs (5, 5') of the U shape.
