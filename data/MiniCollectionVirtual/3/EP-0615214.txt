<ABSTRACT>
Recording when a vehicle travels past electronic toll stations is known as a state of the art. Accounting takes place by monthly invoice. The technical problem is that anonymous accounting should be possible by the same recording method. The basic idea according to the application is that a "numbered account" is opened and this is debited on-line. A combination of two accounting methods by monthly invoice or by debiting the numbered account is possible. There is immediate feedback when the numbered account is empty.

connection through the public telecommunication network 

(4) to at least one toll acquisition control centre (5) 
having a toll memory which, for each badge assigned to 

the toll acquisition control centre (5), has a memory 
location addressable by the badge number, and by means 

of acquiring information about the road toll chargeable 
for the section of road assigned to said toll 

acquisition point in the assigned memory location after 
a toll acquisition point has been passed. 
System for debiting road tolls according to claim 1,
