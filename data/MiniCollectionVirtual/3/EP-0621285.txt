<ABSTRACT>
A novel megakaryocyte amplifier (Meg-POT) derived from man, which has a molecular weight of about 32,000 according 
to SDS-PAGE and contains in its molecule the following amino acid sequence: Gly Glu Thr Gly Gln Glu Ala Ala Pro Leu Asp 

Gly Val Leu. The Meg-POT is promising as a remedy for diseases caused by thrombocytopenia or platellet hypofunction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a megakaryocyte
potentiator (abbreviated as Meg-POT) of human origin
that acts on megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg)
differentiated from pluripotent blood stem cells, and
promotes maturation of megakaryocytes in the presence of
a substance having a megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor
(abbreviated as Meg-CSF) activity, such as interleukin 3
(IL-3).Platelets are one of the corporeal components of
the blood having important significance with respect to
hemostasis and thrombus formation in the body. Platelets
are released into the blood from mature megakaryocytes
formed from hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow via
megakaryocytic precursor cells and megakaryoblasts.Factors having two different types of action are
considered to be required to form megakaryocyte colonies
from myeloid cells (Williams, N. et al., "J. Cell Physiol.",
110, 101 (1982)). More specifically, these factors consist
of Meg-CSF, which by itself result in the formation of
megakaryocyte colonies, and Meg-POT, which, although does
not result in the formation of megakaryocyte colonies by
itself, increases the number of megakaryocyte colonies and
promotes their maturation when added together with Meg-CSF. In human, IL-3 (Teramura, M. et al., "Exp. Hematol.",
16, 843 (1988)) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (Teramura, M. et al., "Exp. Hematol.", 17, 1011
(1989)) have Meg-CSF activity. In addition, examples
of substances having Meg-POT activity in human include
interleukin 6 (Teramura M. and Mizoguchi, H. "Int. J. Cell
Cloning", 8, 245 (1990)), interleukin 11 (Teramura, M. et
al., "Blood", 79, 327 (1992)), erythropoietin (Bruno, E. et al., "Blood", 73, 671 (1989)),
and megakaryocyte amplifier (EP-A 517 925).However, it is also known that these substances
are not specific factors for the megakaryocyte - platelet
lineage, but rather also act on other blood cells as well
as on cells outside the blood cell system. Thus, in the
case of administration of these substances as pharmaceuticals
in anticipation of their action on the megakaryocyte and
platelet systems, there is also the risk of the manifestation
of other actions different from that which is expected.
As such, there is a need for a physiologically active
substance having a high degree of usefulness as a
pharmaceutical product that specifically acts on the
megakaryocyte - platelet system.Thus, the present invention provides a novel human
megakaryocyte potentiator.After culturing cloned cells (HPC-Y5) derived
from human
