<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
a process for the 
production of a semiconductor element (or semiconductor device). Particularly, the present invention 
relates to a process for the 
production of such a semiconductor element which contains an electrode 
forming a Schottky junction such as a field effect transistor 
(FET) (for example a GaAsMESFET (metal-semiconductor field 
effect transistor) and an HEMT (high electron mobility 
transistor)), a Schottky barrier diode and so on. A GaAs FET containing a Schottky gate (hereinafter, 
referred to as "GaAsMESFET") has been used as a semiconductor 
element for a high output in a high frequency band such as a high 
frequency amplifying element due to its good high frequency 
characteristic (especially, its high speed response). Generally, the GaAsMESFET has a problem that a drain 
withstand voltage and a gate withstand voltage are small 
because of effects a high density surface defect state in an 
active layer surface of a GaAs substrate and electric field 
concentration in the active layer immediately below a gate 
electrode. It is necessarily desired for a high output  
 
GaAsMESFET to improve its drain withstand voltage and the gate 
withstand voltage for the purpose of the improvement of its 
output power limit and also its reliability. Figs. 34 to 36 generally show a sequence of a process 
for the production of a GaAsMESFET (71) wherein the transistor 
is shown as its cross sectional view. In the process, a positive - 
type (hereinafter referred to as "p-type") impurity is implanted 
into a surface layer of a semi-insulation GaAs substrate (40) to 
form a p-type active layer (41 ), then a negative-type 
(hereinafter referred to as "n-type") impurity is implanted to 
form a n-type active layer (42), further an n-type impurity is 
implanted in a source region and a drain region to form an n+ - 
type active layer (43) on each side of the n-type active layer 
(see Fig. 34), and then an ohmic metal is placed on the n+-type 
active layers (43) to form a source electrode (44) and a drain 
electrode (45) (see Fig. 35). Then, a gate electrode (47) is 
provided in a recess (46) prepared by etching a portion of the n - 
type active layer (42) (see Fig. 36). Thus, an electric field strength near the drain 
electrode (45) is lowered by providing the n+-type active layers 
(43) in the source region and the drain region, whereby the drain 
withstand voltage is improved. In addition, the electric field 
concentration near the gate electrode (47) and the drain 
electrod
