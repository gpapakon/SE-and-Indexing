<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for regulating the gas pressure in the retort of a coke oven. Pivotable cup valves arranged in the elbows of the ascending pipe are actuated as throttling members according to the pressure curve resulting from gas formation from the coal to be cokefied. Throttling of each individual retort is effected by varying water supply, thus regulating the extent of submersion in water, and regulation follows actual pressure conditions in the retort of the coke oven.

A method for regulating or controlling the gas pressure
of a coke oven battery, in which a cup-shaped restrictor

element arranged in the rising-pipe bends and designed to be
filled with water is operated in accordance with the pressure

variation during the formation of gas from coal to be coked,
characterised in that the restriction of each individual oven

by means of a water level adjustment in the restrictor element
in dependence on the actual pressure conditions in the

particular coke oven chamber is effected in such a way that,
depending on the desired gas pressure in the coke oven

chamber, the water level is adjusted in dependence on the
outflow or inflow of the water from or into the cup-shaped

restrictor element or in dependence on a predeterminable
overflow level.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
restriction is effected in the region of the maximum level of

the water immersion.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
restriction is effected in the region of the minimum level of

the water immersion.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
water immersion which can be regulated is used with coke ovens

with double collecting main operation.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
pressure in the coke oven chamber is regulated such that the

pressure is constant at the level of the minimum chamber
pressure which is known per se.
Apparatus for implementing the method according to one or
more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a swivelling cup 

(1) which has one or more water outflow openings (3) between
the cup base and the cup rim is arranged underneath a rising-pipe

bend (22) and the swivelling cup (1) is designed so that
it can be differently acted upon by water by means of a coal-water

line (33) comprising a valve (32) which is connected via
an operating mechanism (18) and a computer (31) to pressure

measuring points (15, 25, 26, 27 and 28).
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the
base (8) of the swivelling cup (1) is a cone with an upwardly

extending apex and has discharge apertures (7) which are
interrupted by bars (9).
Apparatus for implementing the method according to one ormore
of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a water retaining

element (10) comprising a shaft (11) with an adjustable stop
(12) is swivellably arranged underneath an immersion pipe (13)

and a water level (14) may be created in the immersion pipe
(13) by means of a coal-water line (33) comprising a valve

(32) which is connected via an operating mechanism (18) and a
computer (31) to pressure measuring points (15, 25, 26, 27 and

28).
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that a
swivelling cup (60) with a conical base (61) is designed with

outflow openings (62) and (63) located on different levels.
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that a
swivelling cup (70) with an outflow opening (71) is designed

in such a way that a cleaning mandrel (72) can be inserted
when it is swivelled downwards.
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the
rim of an immersion pipe (13) is designed so as to be oblique

or is provided with recesses or openings.
Apparatus for implementing the method according to one or 
more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a rising-pipe

bend is designed with a U-shape element (9) comprising a
discharge opening (91) and an overflow rim (94) and is

designed so that it can be differently acted upon by water by
means of a coal-water line (33) comprising a valve (32) which

is connected via an operating mechanism (18) and a computer
(31) to pressure measuring points (15, 25, 26, 27 and 28).
Apparatus for implementing the method according to one or
more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a pipe (102)

which may be moved in the vertical direction is arranged
underneath a rising-pipe bend extension (101), the said pipe

being sealed off from the rising-pipe bend extension (101) by
means of an immersion element (103), and the apparatus with a

coal-water line (33) comprising a valve (32) which is
connected via an operating mechanism (18) and a computer (31)

to pressure measuring points (15, 25, 26, 27) ....
