<ABSTRACT>
A dermatologic preparation containing at least one of the benzoic acid derivatives represented by general 
formula (I) and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, having a sufficient effect of inhibiting sebum secretion 

and being free from side effects, thus being safe for the human body, wherein R¹ represents -OH, -OR³ or -NHR³; 
R² represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy; R represents -OR⁴ or (II); R³ represents alkyl, alkenyl or 

hydroxyalkyl; R⁴ represents C₄-C₁₀ linear or branched, saturated or monounsaturated alkyl or cycloalkylalkyl; X 
represents -O- or -NH-; and n represents 1 or 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a preparation for external
application to the skin containing a benzoic acid derivative
having sebaceous secretion inhibitory activity with high
safety for human body and to novel benzoic acid derivatives.Known sebaceous secretion inhibiting agents include
anti-male sex hormone agents, vitamin A acid, royal jelly
acid [Nichihi Kaishi, Vol. 98, No. 4, pp. 469-475 (1988)],
and p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (Japanese Patent Public
Disclosure No. 153616/89).EP-A-0315914 discloses alkyl-arylether derivatives which can be employed in topical
preparations as sebosupressive agents.WO-91105543 discloses topical preparations contains caffeic acid or its esters or
amides.US-A-443 9418 describes unsaturated aryl ketone compounds useful for reducing
sebaceous cell sebum production.EP-A-0570230, a document representing prior art according to Art. 54(3) EPC, discloses
alkyl or alkoxy-substituted 2-hydroxybenzoic acids or salts thereof which may be used in
topical medicaments. The anti-male sex hormone agent is a substance
relative to hormone metabolism, and vitamin A acid also has a
hormone-like action. Exerting their action on not only
sebaceous glands but other organs, these agents give rise to
a great problem of systemic side effects rather than
producing topical effects. Royal jelly acid and the
conventional p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives were
insufficient in their effects.Accordingly, the object of the present
invention is to provide a preparation for external
application to the skin which exhibits sufficient inhibitory
activity on sebaceous secretion and is of high safety for
human body causing no side effects and to provide novel benzoic acid derivatives useful
as active ingredient of the above preparation. This object has been achieved with
a preparation for
external application to the skin containing
at least one benzoic acid derivative represented by
formula (I) shown below or pharmacologically
acceptable salts thereof as an active ingredient:

wherein R1 represents -OH, -OR3 or -NHR3; R2 represents a
hydrogen atom, a C1-C5 alkyl group or a C1-C6 acyl group; R
represents -O-R4 or

R3 represents an alkyl
group, an alkenyl group or a hydroxyalkyl group; R4 
represents a straight-chain or branched, saturated or mono-unsaturated
alkyl group or cycloalkylalkyl group having from
4 to 10 carbon atoms; X represents -O- or -NH-; and n
represents 1 or 2, with the proviso that the compound of formulae (I) is not
2-hydroxy-4-butoxy benzoic acid, 2-hydroxy-5-butoxy benzoic acid or
2-hydrox
