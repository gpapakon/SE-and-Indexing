<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of making a titanium boride metal matrix alloy, by firing a particulate reaction mixture comprising titanium, matrix material and a source of boron (e.g. boron carbide), under conditions such that the titanium and boron react exothermically to form a dispersion of fine particles (preferably greater than 1 micron and less than 10 microns in size) comprising titanium boride (plus titanium carbide where the source of boron is boron carbide) in a predominantly metal matrix. The titanium and matrix are preferably added as a titanium alloy such as ferrotitanium (e.g. eutectic ferrotitanium) or titanium-aluminium. The reaction conditions are preferably selected so that during the reaction a molten zone moves through the body of the reaction mixture, and the average size of the resulting hard particles is uniform throughout the resulting dispersion.

<DESCRIPTION>
Metal Matrix AlloysThis invention relates to a method of making an alloy comprising hard particles comprising titanium boride dispersed in a predominantly metal matrix, and to the resulting alloy itself. Alloys of the aforementioned kind are hereinafter referred to as titanium boride metal matrix alloys.Our U. K. patent application no. 9116174.5, which was filed on 26th July 1991, and which was published on 27th January 1993 as GB 2257985 A, describes and claims a method of making an alloy comprising hard particles comprising titanium carbide dispersed in a predominantly metal matrix, the method comprising firing a particulate reaction mixture comprising carbon, titanium and matrix material, under conditions such that the titanium and carbon react exothermically to form a dispersion of fine particles comprising titanium carbide in a predominantly metal matrix.According to the present invention, there is provided a method of making an alloy comprising hard particles comprising titanium boride disper.sed in a predominantly metal matrix, the method comprising firing a particulate reaction mixture comprising titanium, matrix material and a source of boron, under conditions such that the titanium and boron react exothermically to form a dispersion of fine particles comprising titanium boride in a predominantly metal matrix.It is surprising that the exothermic reaction of the method of the invention is capable of producing a dispersion of fine, hard particles in the matrix. However, we have found that it is possible, using simple trial and error experiments, to find suitable conditions to achieve that end, when the following principles are borne in mind:(i) It is highly desirable to adjust the reaction conditions such that the exothermic reaction is carried out under conditions such that during the reaction a molten zone moves through the body of the reaction mixture, so that at a given point during reaction the reaction mixture ahead of the reaction zone is solid, and so is that behind the reaction zone.(ii) The hard particles may be of generally globular shape. That would indicate that the reaction zone had reached a sufficiently high temperature to allow precipitation of the hard particles. However, in many preferred embodiments of the invention, at least some of the hard particles may be of angular shape, and indeed in many cases they -are all thus shaped. 

(iii) In order to promote uniformity of reaction conditions, and thus .also uniformity of the physical properties of the product, the bulk of the
