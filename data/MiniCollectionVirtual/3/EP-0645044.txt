<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to etching optical
servo tracks on magnetic disks and more particularly, to
steering the laser beam while mechanically moving the optics
to etch the servo tracks in the desired concentric patterns.So-called "floppy" disk memory systems for
"desk top" sized computers are well known in the art. Such
systems employ magetic storage disks having a diameter of
either 5.25 inches (130 mm) or 3.50 inches (89 mm). Conventional magnetic
storage disks for floppy disk drives have a track density
ranging from forty-eight (48) to one hundred thirty-five (135)
tracks per inch (TPI) (i.e., 1.9 to 5.3 tracks/mm). In contrast, optical storage disks
for optical memory systems achieve track densities greater
than 15,000 TPI (590 tracks/mm). The greater track density of optical disks
is achieved by the use of optical servos that maintain fine
positioning of the optical read/write head over the data
tracks on the disk. Typically, concentrical optical servo
tracks are pre-recorded on the optical disk to guide the
servo mechanism.New advances in barium-ferrite magnetic media
have allowed bit densities of magnetic storage disks to
exceed the bit densities of the optical disks. However, as
mentioned above, track densities of magnetic media (48 - 135
TPI i.e., 1,9 to 5,3 tracks/mm) are many times less than their optical counterparts.
This limits the overall capacity of the magnetic disks as 
compared to optical disks. Conventional magnetic disk
systems employ a magnetic servo mechanism and magnetically
pre-recorded servo tracks on the disks to guide the
read/write head. Magnetic servo systems cannot provide the
fine positioning that optical servo systems can provide.Recently, floppy disk systems have been
developed that combine magnetic disk recording techniques
with the high track capacity optical servos found in optical
disk systems. Such a system is described in AN INTRODUCTION
TO THE INSITE 325 FLOPTICAL(R) DISK DRIVE, Godwin, in a paper
presented at the SPIE Optical Data Storage Topical Meeting
(1989). Essentially, an optical servo pattern is pre-recorded
on a magnetic floppy disk. The optical servo
pattern typically consists of a large number of equally
spaced concentric tracks about the rotational axis of the
disk. Data is stored in the magnetic "tracks" between the
optical servo tracks using conventional magnetic recording
techniques. An optical servo mechanism is provided to guide
the magnetic read/write head accurately over the data between
the optical servo tracks. By utilizing optical servo
