<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for guiding of a loading/unloading buoy (2), especially during pulling-up into a receiving space (3) in the bottom of a vessel (1). The device has guide elements (41) on a guide cylinder (11) which is displaceable in the longitudinal direction during monitoring by monitoring means (32) and during side stabilization in order to bring the guide elements closer to the buoy (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device of which
the main component is a guide cylinder having a circular or
possibly other cross-sectional shape and which can be displaced
relative to an air-tightly closable shaft above a
receiving space at the bottom of the vessel. The receiving
space is adapted to the outer shape of the loading/unloading
buoy, and the objective of the device of the invention
especially is to provide for a reliable and gentle guiding
during the pulling-up of the buoy to the correct position in
the receiving space, whereafter locking can take place.The loading/unloading buoy all the time is anchored
by lines to the sea bed. From the bottom of the buoy, a transfer
line in the form of a flexible riser extends down to an
installation or something else on the sea bed. The flowable
medium normally will be hydrocarbons (oil or gas), possibly
also other flowable materials, for example in powder or
particle form.The transfer of medium takes place in that the buoy
is pulled up into the receiving space in the bottom of the
vessel and locked in place, whereafter a coupling unit which
is connected to the tube system of the vessel, is connected.Such a system for the connection of a loading buoy to a floating vessel
and transfer of medium to/from the vessel, is already known from the
international patent applications PCT/NO92/00053 and ...054 (WO 93/11030 and
...031), a vessel which is especially arranged for such connection and
transfer is described in the corresponding application ...055 (..032), and
finally, a loading/unloading buoy which is adapted to be received in the
receiving space of such a vessel is described in the corresponding application
...056 (...033). These documents form part of the state of the art in
relation to this application under Article 54(3) EPC.The technique described therein already involves substantial advantages
for the transfer of medium, and especially the transfer itself as well as the
connection/dis-connection will be able to be carried out under partly very
difficult weather and sea conditions. In order to faciliate 
and make safe the critical phase when the buoy during the
pulling-up for connection in the vessel has arrived at the level
of the bottom of the vessel, to thereafter be introduced into the
receiving space in the bottom, it has turned out, however, that
there is a need for better facilities for guiding. In the
solutions according to the prior art, there is primarily taken
care that the receiving space has an appropriate shape and
surface structure,

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for guiding
a submerged loading/unloading buoy (2) in a receiving space (3)

at the bottom of a floating vessel (1) during pulling-up
or lowering of the buoy (2) to/from a locked position in the

receiving space (3), the arrangement comprising guide elements (41)
for guiding of the movement of the buoy (2) relative to the

receiving space (3), said elements being arranged at the lower
end of a shaft (9) arranged in the vessel (1) above the receiving

space (3), wherein the guide elements (41) are arranged on a
guide cylinder (11) which is displaceable in the longitudinal

direction of the shaft (9) and coaxially relative thereto between
an upper, retracted position and a lower, advanced position,

there being provided a drive means (12) for displacement of the
guide cylinder (11) to a desired position, stabilizing elements

(15, 16, 18) for side stabilization of the guide cylinder (11),
and means (32) for monitoring of the guide elements (41).
An arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the guide
elements (41) form a guide opening which is adapted for guiding

contact with a pick-up line (30) and with the converging
fastening lines (40) of a lifting bridle connecting the buoy (2)

to the pick-up line (30).
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the guide
elements are guide rollers (41) forming an approximately

continuous internal ring at the lower end of the guide cylinder
(11).
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the guide 
elements (41) comprise turning elements for causing turning of

a rotatable outer member of the loading/unloading buoy (2), so
that the buoy during the pulling-up assumes one of a limited

number of angularly determined positions.
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the guide cylinder (11) is arranged within the shaft (9) and

rests against internal stabilizing elements (18).
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the guide cylinder (11) is arranged on the outside of the shaft

(9) and is side-stabilized by external stabilizing elements.
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
the stabilizing elements comprise longitudinally extending rails

(18) and rollers (15) and/or stabilizing lugs (16).
An arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein
the means for power-assisted displacement comprises one or more

hydraulic, pneumatic or, electric actuators (12).
An arrangement according to any of the preceding claims,
comprising a stop means (16, 19, 31) for determining the lower

position of the guide cylinder (11).
An arrangement according to claim 9, wherein the stop means
comprises a completely or partly encircling abutment flange (31)

and/or separate stop lugs (19) at the lower end of the shaft (9).
An arrangement according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the means for monitoring comprise under-water cameras

(32) and/or sensors arranged on the guide cylinder (11) at the
lower end thereof.
