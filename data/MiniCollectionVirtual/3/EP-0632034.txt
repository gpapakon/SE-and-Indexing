<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of known nitroimino compounds as
agents for combating technical materials destroying insects in order preserve these
materials.The resent invention also relates to compositions useful for completely, i.e. not
only against insects but also against fungi, bacteria and algae and for treating soil to
protect technical materials against termite infestations.The invention furthermore relates to processes for treating technical materials
and for soil treatment against termite infestations.The compounds and their insecticidal use in the field of plant protection has
already been known. Compare for example with Japanese Laid-open patent
application No. 235881/1990.Insecticidal agents and compositions of said compounds and their use to
preserve technical materials completely and to treat soil against termite infestations
have not been known up to now.Deferent insects are known as pests infesting technical materials so that due to
serious damages caused thereby undesirable effects on living environment and cultural
assets principally made of these materials have posed a social problem, urgently
requiring effective controlling of the pests. Termites are known as important examples
of pests.At present, use for combating technical materials destroying insects has been
made of organophosphorus insecticides such as phoxim [O-(α-cyanobenzylideneamino)
O,O-diethylphosphoro-thioate], chloropyriphos [O,O-diethyl-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridylphosphorothioate],
etc., as well as pyrethroides series insecticides such as
permethrin [5-benzyl-3-furymethyl-3-(2-methoxy-carbonyl-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane 
carboxylate], decamethrin [α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl d,l-cis-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl
cyclopropane carboxylate], cypermethrin [α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl
(±) cis, trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylate],
fenvalerate [(RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (RS)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate],
cyfluthrine [cyano-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxy-phenyl) methyl-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane
carboxylate].However, the above-mentioned insecticides are unsatisfactory as far as
effective concentration and the long lasting effect are concerned.It has been found that the known compounds of the formula (I)

wherein Z represents 2-chloro-5-pyridiyl or 2-chloro-5-thiazolyl, and
R1 and R2 each independently represents hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl,
can be used to preserve wood or composite wood materials against
attack from wood destroying insects from the order isoptera
