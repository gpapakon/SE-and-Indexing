<ABSTRACT>
Polyester-based thermoplastic polymer compositions having improved 
impact strength and resistance to solvent action together with 

improved working stability comprise: 

a) an aromatic polycarbonate, 
b) an aromatic polyester, 
c) a polycarbonate-polyester block copolymer characterised by 
increased stability of the distribution and average dimension of 

the blocks in the molten state; 
 
said copolymer being obtained by mixing together in the molten 

state under controlled conditions a polycarbonate and a polyester, 
this latter obtained by a process catalysed by compounds of 

lanthanide group metals. 
These compositions demonstrate high compatibility between 
components a) and b) by the effect of the block copolymer, and 

manifest unusual structural and morphological stability even after 
repeated working in the molten state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compatible thermoplastic compositions 
based on polyesters and polycarbonates. In particular, the invention relates to polyester and 
polycarbonate based thermoplastic polymer compositions having an 
improved combination of chemical, mechanical and rheological 
properties compared with each individual polymer component, and 
containing in addition a particular polymeric compatibilizer. 
Thermoplastic polymers have found widespread commercial use 
because a large number of articles can be produced therefrom by 
industrial techniques such as moulding, blow-moulding, extrusion 
and the like, all based on manipulating the polymer in its molten 
state. Many of these materials manifest excellent mechanical, 
chemical, thermal and rheological properties, such as rigidity, 
toughness, high deformation temperature, resistance to solvents 
and aggressive agents, fluidity in the molten state, high 
dielectric constant and the like. Frequently, one or more excellent properties of a polymer are 
accompanied by insufficiency in other properties of technological 
importance, with consequent prejudice to the applicational  
 
potential of the material. In this respect a plastics material of 
high technological merit must combine a satisfactory spread of 
properties such as to enable it to be worked and used in different 
environments under different stress conditions. To satisfy this requirement, considerable research has been 
conducted in recent times on the preparation of mixtures of two or 
more polymers which exhibit the advantages of the individual 
components while at the same time compensating for the 
disadvantages inherent in each of them (synergism). It is however 
known that for thermodynamic reasons the miscibility of two 
polymers of different structure is generally very poor, the 
mixtures obtained being two-phase. It has also been observed that 
the final properties of a polymer mixture depend to a determining 
extent on the mixture micromorphology. Thermoplastic polyesters, particularly polyethyleneterephthalate 
(abbreviated PET) and polybutyleneterephthalate (abbreviated PBT), 
and aromatic polycarbonates, especially those based on bisphenol 
A, each exhibit certain excellent properties and have previously 
been used in attempts to obtain polymer mixtures of high 
technological quality. In particular it has been found that polycarbonate resistance to 
atmospheric agents can be improved by the addition of small 
quantities of polyesters such as PET or PBT. It has also been
