<ABSTRACT>
A metering device (14) for seed drills has an axially displaceable cellular wheel (15) and end terminations which limit the latter in the axial direction and of which one engages with filling bodies (28) into the metering cells (26) of the cellular wheel and the other, together with the cellular wheel, is axially displaceable for adjusting the free volume of the metering cells and is made roller-shaped. The metering cells (26) serve for metering for normal sowing, whilst the filling bodies (28) possess circumferentially metering gaps (33) for fine sowing and, for the metering of the latter, are axially fixably connected to the cellular wheel. To prevent feed leakages in the region of the housing lead-throughs, to broaden the metering range and to improve the metering accuracy, provision is made for one end termination to be a sleeve (19) arranged fixedly to the rotation, but axially adjustable together with the cellular wheel, and for the filling bodies (28) to be axially displaceable relative to the cellular wheel (15) between a position for normal sowing and a position for fine sowing, there being provided a single adjusting device which acts axially on the cellular wheel (15) and displaces the latter when the filling bodies (28) are stationary (normal-sowing metering) and which, when the cellular wheel and filling bodies are coupled, adjusts these axially (fine-sowing metering).

Sowing machine with a seed container having at least one discharge 
opening (2), a discharge shaft (3) connected thereto and a proportioning 

device (14) mounted in the side walls thereof and comprising a rotated, 
axially adjustable bucket wheel (15) for proportioning normal seed, which 

is mounted on its one side by means of a non-rotary sleeve (19) axially 
movable therewith in one side wall (17), ledge-like filling bodies (28), 

which are axially adjustable on the bucket wheel and form on their circumference 
proportioning gaps (33) for proportioning fine seed, and a bearing 

part (34) axially defining said proportioning gaps and with which the 
proportioning device (14) is rotary-mounted in the other side wall (18), 

characterized in that the sleeve (19) forms one front end closure for all 
the proportioning buckets (26) of the bucket wheel (15) during the proportioning 

of normal seed (15) and for all the proportioning gaps when proportioning 
fine seed, that the ledge-like filling bodies in a normal seed 

position, in which they form the other front end closure (25) for the 
proportioning buckets (26), can be axially fixed to the machine and in a 

fine seed position, in which they engage with their inner ends on the 
sleeve while filling the proportioning buckets, to the bucket wheel (15), 

and that for proportioning normal seed and fine seed a single adjusting 
device (20, 21) is provided, which acts axially on the sleeve (19) and the 

bucket wheel (15). 
Sowing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the sleeve (19) 
is circular cylindrical barrel-shaped and is supported in non-rotary manner 

outside the side wall (17). 
Sowing machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the sleeve 
(19) and bucket wheel (15) have the same external diameter. 
Sowing machine according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the ends of the ledge-shaped filling bodies (28) located outside the 

discharge shaft (3) are placed on a bearing ring (29), which has on its inner 
circumference radial grooves with which it is guided on the bucket wheel webs 

(31). 
Sowing machine according to claim 4, characterized in that the ledge-like 

filling bodies (28) are adjustable between the normal and the fine seed position 
by means of the bearing ring (29).  

 
Sowing machine according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that on the 
bearing ring (29) are mounted ratchet levers (30), which for axially fixing the 

filling bodies (28) in the normal seed position can be inserted in a 
machine-fixed ring groove (38) and in the fine seed position in a groove (39) 

on the bucket wheel (15). 
Sowing machine according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the inner front end of the sleeve (19) engages on the facing front end of the 

bucket wheel (15) except for a small clearance and in an area facing the discharge 
shaft (3) has a larger spacing (24). 
Sowing machine according to one of the claims 1 to 7, in which the proportioning 
device is driven by a raisable bottom wheel of the machine, characterized 

in that the bottom wheel is gear-connected with a spur gear (36) on the 
bearing part (34). 
Sowing machine according to claim 8, characterized in that the gear connection 
has a gear wheel (40), which meshes with the spur gear (36) on the 

bearing part (34) when sowing and can be disengaged for interrupting the gear 
connection. 
Sowing machine according to claim 8 or 9 with a stirrer (11) rotating above
