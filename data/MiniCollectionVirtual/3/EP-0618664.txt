<ABSTRACT>
A linear electromagnetic driving apparatus includes a substantially rectangular 
tube-shaped magnetic yoke comprised of outer (9) and inner (10) frame plates spaced 

apart to form a gap (11) with at least one magnet (16) secured to an outer (9) or inner 
(10) frame plate to generate magnetic flux. A bobbin (14) supporting a coil (24) 

which extends in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the magnetic yoke 
(8,9,10) is positioned in the gap (11). A driven member (12,13) is secured to and 

coaxial with the bobbin (14) and has openings (35) to receive the inner frame plates 
(10) of the yoke such that when the coil (24) is energized to move the bobbin (14) in 

the gap (11), the inner frame plates (10) extend into and through the bobbin (14) and 
into and through the openings (35) of the driven member (12,13). A fixed shaft (4a) 

extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the yoke; and a bearing (18a) secured to the 
bobbin structure and extending outwardly therefrom receives and is slidable on the 

fixed shaft (4a). At least one of the corners formed on the rectangular tube-shaped 
yoke (8,9,10) is cut out to define an open portion through which the bearing (18a) 

passes so as to be unobstructed as the bobbin (14) slides within the yoke.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromagnetic driving apparatus and, more 
particularly, to such apparatus which exhibits compact size, is of light weight and 
finds ready application in a camera to adjust the lenses therein, such as for zooming 
and/or focusing purposes. Motor-driven lenses for zooming and/or focusing have been designed for 
photographic cameras, video cameras, electronic still cameras, and the like. In one 
arrangement, a motor is used to drive a worm screw on which is mounted a lens 
holder, resulting in bidirectional movement of the lens. This structure is relatively 
large, bulky, heavy and complex; and typically is used to provide gross movements (as 
opposed to fine movements) of the lens. Consequently, apparatus of this type has 
been used heretofore to implement a motor-driven zoom operation, but typically not a 
motor-driven focusing operation. Other motor-drive arrangements which can be used both for zooming and 
focusing employ what has come to be known as a voice coil motor. One example of a 
motor-driven lens assembly which incorporates a voice coil motor is described in U.S. 
Patent 5,220,461, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Another example 
of a motor-driven lens assembly which incorporates a voice coil motor is illustrated in 
accompanying Figs. 1 and 2. This assembly finds particular application in the lens 
barrel of a video camera, such as the type shown in Fig. 3. In the lens assembly of Fig. 
1, a fixed lens, referred to as a forward lens unit 120, cooperates with a zoom lens 121 
which is driven by a stepping motor 122. An image from zoom lens 121 passes 
through a diaphragm unit 123 to a focusing lens unit 125. The combination of zoom 
lens 121 and diaphragm 123 typically is referred to as a zoom unit 126. Focusing unit 
125 is comprised of a fixed lens 124, a movable unit 103 which includes a lens whose 
position is adjusted to effect proper focusing and a fixed unit 102 supported within a 
casing 101. Units 102 and 103 in combination comprise a voice coil motor, as will be 
described. Movable unit 103 includes bearing members slidable on shafts 104a and 
104b which are mounted in casing 101 and extend in a direction parallel to the 
longitudinal axis of the voice coil motor.  
 Stepping motor 122 is used to vary the position of zoom lens 121 over a 
relatively wide range so as to effect a zoom function to provide both telephoto and 
wide-angle imaging. The range of movement of unit 103 is relatively small in 
comparison to that of stepping motor
