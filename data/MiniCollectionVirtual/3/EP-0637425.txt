<ABSTRACT>
The adjustable backrest (2) on the lifter (6) is supported by a plane (14) sloping down to the head rest (5) and on the underside of the backrest. A wedge-shaped slide (16), acting on the headrest, has a support surface (18) parallel to the backrest's sloping plane, and facing the lifter. When the headrest is lowered, the support surface protrudes beyond the sloping plane and is gripped by the lifter after the backrest has performed a pre-set swivel movement for lift the headrest in relation to the backrest. The wedge-shaped slide piece presses against a counter bearing (17) on the underside of the headrest.

Adjusting device for the head-rest of a bed, which
is supported in a pivoting manner on a back-rest section,

which can also be pivoted, and can be raised separately
by means of an upright lifting facility which moves the

back-rest section and can be guided along the length of
the bed frame,

characterised in that variable-position support of the
back-rest section (2) on the lifting means (6) is

provided by an inclined plane (14) on its lower side
which slopes down to the headrest (5), the plane being

assigned a wedge-shaped slider (16) which acts on the
headrest (5) and has a support surface (18) which faces

the lifting means (6) and is essentially parallel to the
inclined plane (14) of the back-rest section (2), the

support surface, when the headrest (5) is in the lowered
position, standing out above the inclined plane (14) and

only being caught by the lifting means (6) after a

predetermined pivoting movement of the back-rest section
(2) for raising the headrest (5) relative to the back-rest

section (2).
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the wedge-shaped slider (16) which acts on the

headrest (5) is guided in such a manner that it can be
moved along the back-rest section (2) in the longitudinal

direction of the bed (1) and presses against an end
support (17) fitted to the underside of the headrest (5).
Adjusting device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that a chain of elements (6) acts as

common lifting means for the headrest (5) and the back-rest
section (2), the chain consisting of adjacent rows 

of individual segments (7) and being contained, in such a
manner that it can be moved longitudinally, in a guide

duct (10) leading to the inclined plane (14) of the back-rest
section (2) or the wedge-shaped slider (16) which

moves the headrest (5) and at the other end ending in a
horizontal section, the individual segments (7) being

connected in an articulated manner in the plane of
movement of the back-rest section (2) and of the headrest

(5) so that they form a free-standing support body
outside the guide duct (10) as a result of mutual

interlocking, while being able to adjust inside the guide
duct (10) to its partially curved course by cancelling

their interlocking.
Adjusting device according to Claim 3, characterised
in that a motorised or manually driven cogwheel (12),

which engages with a cross-gearing of the individual
segments (7), is provided for the movement of the

longitudinally movable chain of elements (6).
