<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for applying heat sufficient to 
permit plastic deformation of intermetallic material. The heat 

is applied to a fractional region of a workpiece, and then 
manipulations capable of causing the workpiece to deform are 

applied using conventional sheet metal forming equipment. The 
invention utilizes elevated forming temperatures to heat the 

fractional region of the intermetallic workpiece so that the 
fractional region has sufficient ductility to permit a plastic 

deformation required for the forming operation. The apparatus is 
a sheet metal-working machine which has been modified to provide 

the localized heating required to carry out the process of the 
present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for forming
titanium alloy materials, and more particularly to a method of
forming titanium aluminide materials using conventional sheet
metal equipment and tooling to fabricate structural components
and localized heating of the workpiece alone. In the family of intermetallic metals, titanium
aluminide materials have become most useful in the design of
structures requiring a high strength-to-weight ratio. Although
unique in the class of titanium alloy compositions, titanium
aluminide materials may, like the more typical titanium alloys,
contain additions of one or more alloying agents such as tin,
zirconium, molybdenum, vanadium, silicon, chromium, manganese and
iron. Titanium aluminide materials find particular application
in the field of aircraft and spacecraft design.While several important end uses exist for titanium
aluminide materials, there still remain various difficulties in
effecting deformation of these materials to achieve a final,
desired useful shape. The most frequently encountered obstacle
is the inability to manipulate these materials, for it has become
well-known that titanium aluminides are relatively brittle and
not amenable to forming with conventional techniques at or near
room temperatures. One recent approach which has found widespread utility
in the fashioning of structural components from such materials is
superplastic forming, a process in which a superplastic material
(eg., a titanium or aluminum alloy) is heated to a forming
temperature, generally in the range of from
926°C to 1038°C
(1700° F. to
1900° F.), and then formed in a die using positive or
negative pressure on one side of the metal to force the metal to
plastically "flow" against or into the die.Although the advantages of superplastic forming are
numerous, the process has drawbacks. For one thing, it requires
special equipment including a controlled environment within the
heating and forming apparatus, the application of very high
forming temperatures (on the order of
926°C to 1038°C
(1700° F. to
1900° F.)), and specially designed tools for handling the
materials and equipment while heated and before they are fully
cooled. Additionally, the heating and cooling phases of the
process take place over extended periods of time and require
uniquely designed tool supports having appropriate thermal
coefficients to accomodate the high forming temperatures. For
these reasons, as well as the fact that this process requires
thermal treatment of not only the whole workpiece, but also

<CLAIMS>
A method for transforming a substantially planar
sheet of titanium aluminide material into a non-planar

structural component using a conventional
press brake machine, comprising:


locating one region of said sheet material where a
first deformation of said sheet material is to take

place,
heating said one region at one side thereof to a
temperature of at least 200°C and no more than 400°C for a

predetermined period of time, and
deforming said heated region into a desired shape by
pressing an upper die associated with said press

brake machine against said region and toward a lower
die associated with said press brake machine,

whereby a substantially planar sheet of material is
transformed into a non-planar structural component.
The method of claim 1, where the step of locating
comprises defining all of said regions of said sheet

where deforming is to take place, and then performing
each of said further steps of said process

sequentially at each of said defined regions, whereby
a plurality of deformations are imparted to said

sheet of material to cause said sheet to be
transformed into a corrugated structural component.
The method of claim 1, wherein said step of applying
a predetermined amount of heat to each of said

regions comprises moving a heated source between a
first position of non-use and a second actuatable

position where the heat source is positioned in
overlying correspondence with the identified region.
