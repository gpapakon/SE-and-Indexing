<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a glow switch starter comprising 

a glass discharge vessel which is sealed in a gastight manner and is provided 
with an ionizable medium, 
a pair of electrical conductors which are passed through a wall of the discharge 
vessel, 
a bimetallic element conductively connected to one of the electrical conductors, 
and 
a getter. 
According to the invention, the getter comprises an alloy of zirconium and 
palladium to which oxygen is bonded. It is achieved thereby that the glow switch starter 

ignites a discharge lamp comparatively quickly also when no or only a small quantity of 
radioactive material has been provided in the discharge vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a glow switch starter comprising 
a glass discharge vessel which is sealed in a gastight manner and is provided 
with an ionizable medium, a pair of electrical conductors which are passed through a wall of the discharge 
vessel, a bimetallic element conductively connected to one of the electrical conductors, 
and a getter. Such a glow switch starter is known from US Patent 5,001,391. The 
operation of such a glow switch starter is as follows. When used for igniting a 
discharge lamp, the glow switch starter shunts the discharge lamp and is connected in 
series with electrodes of the discharge lamp. A voltage present across the discharge 
lamp generates a glow discharge between the electrical conductors of the glow switch 
starter. This glow discharge heats the bimetallic element connected to one of the 
electrical conductors, which element is so deformed under the influence of this heating 
that it makes contact with the other electrical conductor. The creation of this contact 
extinguishes the glow discharge, and a current flows through the electrodes of the 
discharge lamp via the electrical conductors and the bimetallic element of the glow 
switch starter. This current brings the electrodes of the discharge lamp to a temperature 
at which emission of electrons takes place to a sufficient degree for enabling the 
discharge lamp to ignite. During heating of the electrodes of the discharge lamp, the 
bimetallic element of the glow switch starter cools down and is so deformed thereby 
that the contact between the two electrical conductors of the glow switch starter is 
broken. Breaking of the contact also interrupts the current through the electrodes of the 
lamp and generates an ignition voltage pulse in an inductive element which is connected 
in series with the lamp. If this ignition voltage pulse generates a discharge between the  
 
electrodes of the discharge lamp, the voltage across the discharge lamp, and thus the 
voltage between the electrical conductors of the glow switch starter, drops so strongly 
that no further glow discharge occurs. If on the other hand the ignition voltage pulse 
generates no discharge between the electrodes of the discharge lamp, the process 
described above will repeat itself. A problem which often arises with glow switch starters is that impurities 
in the ionizable medium can considerably slow down the creation of the glow discharge. 
This is especially the case when the glow switch starter has been present in a room with 
a low luminous
