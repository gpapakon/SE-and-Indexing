<ABSTRACT>
A working platform comprises mutually parallel uprights which are connected to one another in the manner of a ladder by crossmembers. The platforms (1) can be suspended on crossmembers (6) located at the same level by means of hooks which are fastened on the narrow end sides of said platform, are open downwards and are provided with lift-out safeguards. In order to be able to remove the crossmembers again at any time in a simple manner, each lift-out safeguard comprises elements or plates (10, 11) which can be displaced with respect to one another in the vertical direction and of which the outer plate (10), assigned to the crossmember, is provided at its lower end region with a lug (12) which engages beneath the crossmember in a positively locking manner, and at least the inner plate is of a wedge-shaped design. The two plates are guided on guides, provided on the end side of the platform, such that the outer plate (10), in its bottom and/or pivoted-out position, engages behind the crossmember (6) with its lug (12) and the inner plate (11), supported directly or indirectly on the end side of the platform, in its bottom position braces the outer plate (10) in its locking position.

Scaffold structure, preferably a scaffold for working on 
façades or similar, with stanchions arranged parallel to 

one another which are connected in the manner of a ladder 
by cross members (6) or cross bars on which platforms (1) 

may be suspended at the same level by means of hooks (5) 
fitted to their narrow faces (2), which hooks (5) being 

open at the bottom in their position of use and being 
provided with securing devices to prevent lift-off,
characterised in that
 
each anti-lift-off securing device consists of elements or 

plates (10, 11) which, in their position of use, move in 
opposite relative directions in the vertical plane, of 

which elements or plates (10, 11) the outer plate (10) 
facing the cross member (6) is provided at its bottom end 

section with a nose or catch (12) which engages under the 
cross member to form a positive lock, and at least the 

inner plate (11) is of wedge-shaped design, and that both 
plates are guided on guides (7) provided at the end face 

of the platform such that the outer plate (10) in its 
bottom and/or outswung position engages with its nose (12) 

behind the cross member, and the inner plate (11) which 
is either directly or indirectly supported by the end face 

of the platform, clamps in its lower position the outer 
plate (10) in its locking position. 
Scaffold structure according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the two plates (10, 11) are guided on a common bolt 

(7) in oblong holes (15). 
Scaffold structure according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the outer plate (10) is provided 

with a hole of a certain diameter or of a certain length 
such that it can swivel at least between its locking 

position and its release position.  
 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the inner plate (11) exhibiting a 

wedge angle tapering downwards is provided with a vertical 
oblong hole (12) of such a length that the plate (11) can 

be raised to a position which releases the outer plate 
(10), while in its locked position, said inner plate (11) 

rests with the top end of the oblong hole at most just on 
the bolt (7). 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the outer plate (10) is provided on 

its inner face with a wedge-shaped surface which is 
complementary to the inner plate (11). 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the plates (10, 11) are provided 

with anti-rotation devices to prevent relative rotational 
movement. 
Scaffold structure according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the anti-rotation device consists of two pins (18, 

19) fastened to one plate, which at least partially 

penetrate oblong holes (20, 21) in the other plate (10) 
running parallel to oblong hole (15). 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that two fixed pins are provided at the 

end face of the platform for guiding the plates. 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the inner plate (11) is provided at 

its bottom edge with a widened or angled section (17). 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 2 to 9, 
characterised in that the guide bolt or guide bolts (7) 

are fastened to an edge profile section (2) at the end 
face of each platform, which profile section (2) exhibits  

 
a flat outer support surface for the inner wedge plate 

(11). 
Scaffold structure according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the edge profile section (2) of the 

platform is provided at the end with the hooks (5) and at 
its centre with the plates (10, 11) which form the anti-lift-off 

securing device.
