<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an expanded foamed bead for a rubber-modified styrene polymer, comprising a plurality of closed cells defined by cell walls which constitute a matrix for the bead, wherein each of the cell walls comprises two surfaces separated by a distance equal to the thickness of the cell wall. The matrix comprises: (a) a continuous styrene polymer phase; (b) a rubber phase dispersed in said continuous styrene polymer phase (a), wherein the rubber phase comprises a plurality of substantially flat, butadiene polymer rubber particles each having at least one styrene polymer particle occluded therein; wherein the flat rubber particles are arranged in lamellar configuration along the thickness of the cell wall and are oriented so that the long axis of a cross section of each flat rubber particle, as viewed in a cross section of the cell wall, taken along the thickness of the cell wall, is substantially parallel to the two surfaces of the cell wall, and wherein the cell wall and each flat rubber particle satisfies specific dimensional relationships. The expanded foamed bead of the present invention is not only excellent in its ability to retain a foaming agent gas within the closed cells, but also can advantageously be employed for producing, for example, packaging materials and cushioning materials or packings, as ultimate foamed, molded products, having excellent mechanical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved expanded foamed bead of a rubber-modified styrene polymer. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with an expanded foamed bead of a rubber-modified styrene polymer,
comprising a plurality of closed cells defined by cell walls which constitute a matrix for the bead. Each of the cell walls
comprises two surfaces separated by a distance equal to the thickness of the cell wall. The matrix comprises: (a) a
continuous styrene polymer phase; and (b) a rubber phase dispersed in said continuous styrene polymer phase (a),
wherein the rubber phase comprises a plurality of substantially flat, butadiene polymer rubber particles each having
at least one styrene polymer particle occluded therein; wherein the flat rubber particles are arranged in a specific
lamellar configuration along the thickness of the cell wall. The expanded foamed bead of a rubber-modified styrene
polymer of the present invention is excellent in its ability to retain a foaming agent gas within the closed cells, and can
advantageously be employed for producing, for example, packaging materials and cushioning materials or packings
which are improved in resistance to breakage, such as cracking.Expanded foamed beads of a styrene polymer are molded into various shaped products. During the molding, the
expanded foamed beads are further foamed (or expanded) to give an ultimate foamed, molded product. The obtained
foamed, molded products are widely employed as, for example, packaging materials and cushioning materials or packings.
However, foamed, molded products produced from conventional expanded foamed beads of a styrene polymer
are insufficient in resistance to breakage, such as cracking. Therefore, for example, when a foamed, molded product
produced from conventional expanded foamed beads of a styrene polymer is used as a cushioning material in packaging
an article having a relatively large weight and the packaged article is transported, there is a danger that when
the packaged article sustains a jolt or impact during the transportation, the cushioning material suffers cracking. When
the packaged article further repeatedly sustains an impact after the cracking of the cushioning material, it is likely that
the article is damaged.The cracking of a cushioning material can be prevented by increasing the thickness of the cushioning material.
However, when the thickness of a cushioning material to be used in packaging an article is increased, the volume of
the resultant package becomes inevitably
