<ABSTRACT>
A digital encoder has a photosensitive element (8) overlying portions of spaced conductors (5, 6). A light beam (X, Y) derived from a source spans the conductors and is traversed along them. Where the beam illuminates the photosensitive element (8) is made conductive. Thus, depending on the local overlap of the photosensitive element (8) and the conductors (5, 6), there is either electrical connection or not between the conductors according to the position of the beam (X, Y). This can be used to produce a digital code output. Generally it is the light source that will be moved when the conductors (5, 6) are straight, but for annular conductors of a rotary encoder the movement of the beam may be generated by movable mirrors reflecting light from a stationary source.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Improvements relating to Digital Encoders" This invention relates to digital encoders. With the increased use of digital electronic components and systems in a large number of industries, and ever- increasing demands put on equipment for consistency and reliability, there is a need for non-contacting digital encoders which do not suffer the usual problems with wear and changing tactile characteristics.It is the aim of this invention to provide such an encoder, whose life can be expected to be virtually indefi¬ nite, and without significant deterioration.According to the present invention there is provided a non-contacting digital encoder comprising a first component for transmitting a light beam and a second component with a photo-sensitive element overlying portions of spaced conductors, the components being relatively movable so that the light beam traverses the conductors and photo-sensitive element and coded information related to the position of the light beam is derived from the conductors by virtue of their electrical connection or non-connection through the illumi¬ nated conducting portion of the photo-sensitive element.The motion may be linear or rotary and although with a linear device the beam will usually be derived from a light source that moves, while the second component remains stationary, that arrangement could be reversed. With a rotary device, it may be convenient to have both the light source and the second component stationary, while the movement of the beam is obtained by moving a reflective 

 device in the path of the beam from the source.The digital output can be absolute or incremental. An absolute bit pattern will represent the actual position of the slider at any point along its travel while an incremental output can be used to increase or decrease an external counter when there is movement of the slider.When no light falls on the photo-sensitive material it offers a relatively high resistance electrical circuit. But when light from the light source falls on to the photo- sensitive material, the electrical characteristics of the material change and a relatively low resistance path is generated. This change in property of the material can be used effectively to connect two conductors together electri¬ cally by the beam spanning a gap between them bridged by the photo-sensitive material. The electrical signal output pattern is determined and controlled by the inter-relation¬ ship of the photo-sensitive material and the conducting material on which it is overlaid.The moving

CLAIMS 1. A non-contacting digital encoder comprising a first component for transmitting a light beam and a second component with a photo-sensitive element overlying portions of spaced conductors, the components being relatively movable so that the light beam traverses the conductors and photo-sensitive element and coded information related to the position of the light beam is derived from the conductors by virtue of their electrical connection or non-connection through the illuminated conducting portion of the photo- sensitive element.
