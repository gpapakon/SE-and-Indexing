<ABSTRACT>
Food cooking oven, comprising an access door (1), a 
cooking cavity (2), a motor-driven fan (3) situated on 

the back side of said cooking cavity, a partition wall 
(4) arranged to diffuse the air flow generated by said 

fan, a rear chamber (5) situated behind said fan and 
confined on its front side by said fan and said partition 

wall (4), and provided with a conduit (6), an end portion 
of which terminates with a nozzle (7) positioned near the 

wheel of the fan (3), whereas the other end portion of 
which is connected with a reservoir (8) comprising a pump 

(9) adapted to pump the liquid contained in said 
reservoir into said conduit (6), said pump (9) and said 

fan (3) being connected to a control device (10) adapted 
to control their operation, and further provided with a 

second conduit (17), the outlet end portion of which 
terminates with a second nozzle (18) that is also 

arranged close to the fan (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a food cooking oven
with fan-assisted operation, which is adapted to perform
cooking cavity cleaning automatically.In the following description reference is made in
particular to a food cooking oven of the type intended
for use in catering operations, professional kitchens and
similar applications. It will however be appreciated that
what is described and claimed in connection thereto in
this patent actually applies to any kind whatsoever of
food cooking ovens.It is generally known that, during cooking of
foodstuffs in an oven, and especially during fan-assisted
operation of such an of oven, the cooking cavity thereof
is subject to quick and heavy soiling by splashes of food
particles and juice or gravy droplets, as well as, in
particular in the case of ovens with fan-assisted
operation, due to the effect of conveyance of the air
(air-borne soil) that becomes impregnated with emanations 
from the food being cooked and deposits them onto the
walls of the oven cavity. If a sufficiently high
temperature is prevailing in the oven cavity, such
particles being deposited on the walls thereof become
thermally set thereon due to their burning and charring.Such a soiling of the oven cavity is a wholly
undesired effect, since it gives rise to a number of
well-known drawbacks which are shortly discussed here
only for the sake of a better understanding of the
problem. First of all, the very presence of food
remainders in the oven cavity brings about the
possibility of a decay and putrefaction thereof, with
obvious risks of a hygienic-sanitary nature resulting
therefrom. Furthermore, such food residues deposited
onto the oven cavity walls, especially when they are not
burned or charred, are generally subject to progressive
deterioration as they go through subsequent cooking
cycles in the oven cavity, and tend to dissolve by giving
off fumes and unpleasant odours.Now, these drawbacks are generally tolerated, albeit
to a certain extent, when they relate to cooking ovens
used in household applications, where there is no
definite obligation set by external authorities
governing the way in which oven cavities should be
cleaned. However, even there such a problem is being felt
to such an extent that the solution consisting of
providing the ovens with a so-called self-cleaning
feature is widely known to have rapidly expanded in the
marketplace. In this case, the ovens are generally
provided with plates that are used to clad the walls and
are provided with a special pyrolytic coating: upon

<CLAIMS>
Food cooking oven, comprising an access door (1), a cooking
cavity (2), a motor-driven fan (3) situated on the back side of

said cooking cavity (2), a partition wall (4) provided to diffuse the
air flow generated by said fan (3), a chamber (5) accomodating said

fan (3) and confined on its front side by said partition wall (4),

a first branch (22) being provided with an end portion
connected via a pump (9) to a first reservoir (8)

adapted to supply detergent substances,
a second branch (23) being additionally provided, an end
portion of which terminates via a respective pump to a

second reservoir, adapted to supply
rinsing liquids,
the opposite ends of said first and second portions terminating
with respective nozzles (7,18),
characterized in that
 said nozzles (7,18) provided for spraying
the detergent substance and the rinsing liquid, respectively, are

joined together into a single nozzle (20) coming out from a
single conduit (21) which is divided into said first and second

branches (22,23).
Cooking oven according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said
source of said end portion of said second branch (23) is

connected to the water supply mains. 
Cooking oven according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized in that

there are provided two devices (24,25) on the respective branches
(22,23) which are adapted to prevent liquids from flowing towards

the respective reservoirs.
Cooking oven according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said
devices (24,25) are constitued by check valves or solenoid

valves.
