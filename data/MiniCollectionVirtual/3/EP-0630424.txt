<ABSTRACT>
A method to produce high quality doped and undoped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. The PZT films which contains a perovskite structure were deposited on sapphire disks, Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si wafers, and RuOx/SiO2/Si wafers using hot-wall and cold-wall CVD reactors at a deposition temperature of 550  DEG C and a reduced pressure of 6 torr. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a hot-wall MOCVD apparatus which contains gaseous sources, a three-zone furnace, and a mechanical pump. The source materials include an oxidizing agent and metalorganic precursors such as metal alkoxides, metal acetylacetonates, or metal  beta -diketonates. The stoichiometry of the films can be easily controlled by varying the individual precursor temperature and/or the flow rate of the carrier gas. The Pb(Zr0.82Ti0.12)O3 film produced by the present invention shows a spontaneous polarization of 23.3  mu C/cm

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved metalorganic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) of ferroelectric thin films such as doped and undoped Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3
thin films using safe and stable precursors lead tetramethylheptadione, zirconium
tetramethylheptadione, and titanium ethoxide. The lead zirconate titanate (Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 or PZT] ceramics are well known
materials with the perovskite structure which have useful ferroelectric and electro-optic
properties. Recent studies showed that PZT materials offer high permittivity for
capacitors, large spontaneous polarization for nonvolatile memory devices, large
electromechanical coupling coefficient for surface acoustic wave (SAW) applications, and
good optical properties for electro-optic devices.A variety of techniques have been used for the deposition of ferroelectric thin films. In
general, the thin film deposition techniques can be divided into two major categories; i.e.,
(1) physical vapor deposition (PVD) and (2) chemical processes. Among the PVD
techniques, the most common methods used for the deposition of ferroelectric thin films are
electron beam evaporation, rf diode sputtering, rf magnetron sputtering, dc magnetron
sputtering, ion beam sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and laser ablation, see
Oikawa et al., "Preparation of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films by an electron beam evaporation
technique," Appl. Phys. Lett., 29(8), 491 (1976), Okada et al., "Some electrical and optical
properties of ferroelectric lead-zirconate-lead-titanate thin films," J. Appl. Phys., 48(7),
2905 (1977), Takayama et al., "Preparation of epitaxial Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 thin films and
their crystallographic, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties," J. Appl. Phys., 65(4),
1666 (1989), Sreenivas et al., "Surface acoustic wave propagation on lead zirconate titanate
thin films," Appl. Phys. Lett., 52(9), 709 (1988), and Ramesh et al., "Ferroelectric
Pb(Zr0·2Ti0·8)O3 thin films on epitaxial Y-Ba-Cu-O," Appl. Phys. Lett., 59(27), 3542
(1991). The chemical processes can be further divided into two subgroups; i.e., the
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the wet chemical process including sol-gel process
and metalorganic decomposition (MOD). The first successful PZT films were produced by
PVD techniques (e-beam evaporation and rf diode sputtering) in 1976, then followed by
MOD process and sol-gel technique in mid 1980s, see Fukushima et al., "Preparation of
ferroelectric PZT films by thermal decomposition of organometallic compounds," J. Mater.
