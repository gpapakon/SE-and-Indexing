<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit board (1) having at least one surface (2) which is printed with a circuit, having at least one edge region (5) which is constructed as a contact area, and having an edge connector (10) which can be plugged onto the edge region (5) and has a retaining groove (11) for clamping fixing, a fixing slot (8) being incorporated in the edge region (5) of the printed circuit board (1), and a fixing web (13), which runs essentially at right angles to the printed circuit board surfaces (2) in the final assembled state, being constructed on the edge connector (10) in such a manner that the fitting slot (8) acts as a groove and the fixing web (13) has a tongue of a tongue and groove combination for additional positively locking fixing of the edge connector (10) on the printed circuit board (1).

<CLAIMS>
An edge connector (10) to be pushed onto an edge zone (5),
formed as a contact bank (7), of a printed circuit board (1);

with at least one fixing slot (8) formed in the edge zone (5) and
extending in the insertion direction (9); with a receiving groove

(11) for fixing the edge zone (5) with a clamping grip, in which
arrangement, cooperating contacts are provided on the internal

surface of at least one groove side wall (12) of the receiving
groove (11) for loading the contact bank (7); and with a fixing

member (13) extending perpendicularly to the groove side wall
(12) and insertable into the fixing slot (8) for an additional

securing action with a form-fit,

   characterized in that

along the whole fixing member (13) there are formed two guide
lips (19) extending parallel to one another in the insertion

direction of the connector, formed as spring strips.
An edge connector according to claim 1,

   characterized in that

the fixing member (13) forms an end wall covering the whole
cross-section of the receiving groove (11).
An edge connector according to claim 1 or 2,

   characterized in that

on both end sides of the receiving groove (11) there is provided
one fixing member (13) each, in which arrangement the fixing

members (13) and the groove side walls (12) of the receiving
groove (11) form a rectangular hollow box.
An edge connector according to one of claims 1 to 3,

   characterized in that

contact elements, preferably formed as spring clips, are mounted
on both internal sides of the groove side walls (12) for forming

a touch contact with the contact bank (7); and that in the groove
bottom remote from the edge zone (5) of the printed circuit board 

(1), in the final assembled state, there are formed sockets (14),
preferably terminal or screw-type sockets, provided as connector

elements for conductor cables.
An edge connector according to one of claims 1 to 4,

   characterized in that

the guide lips (19) have a cross-section tapering with an
increasing distance from the fixing member (13).
An edge connector according to one of claims 1 to 5,

   characterized in that

on the outer side of the or each fixing member (13) there is
provided an engagement projection (18) which can engage in a

complementary engagement recess (17) formed in the printed
circuit board (1).
