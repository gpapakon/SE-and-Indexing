<ABSTRACT>
The screw fitting has a clamping ring (6) with a collar (8) at one end (6a) engaging over the pipe end face and reduced wall thickness at the other end (6b) for pressing against the pipe under the action of a screw-on nut. The end side of the first end (6a) has radially inside the clamping ring sealing face (9) for the first elastic seal (11) a ring indentation (10) which extends from the inner circumference (8a) of the collar (8) radially outwards to end at a distance from the outer circumference (6c) of the clamping ring (6) to leave a ring shaped sealing edge (12) enclosing the first seal (11). The entire area of the collar and inside of the clamping ring between the seals has an elastic sealing layer lining (15) to form a cohesive one piece seal unit (16) with the two seals (11,14). Between the clamping ring and a further inwardly aligned collar provided on an end of the nut remote from the connecting pipe (1) is a pressure ring with inner cone acting on the second end (6b) of the clamping ring, and a radial ring ledge adjoining the collar of the screw on nut.

A butt type screw pipe coupling, with a connector union having a radially extending 
sealing surface, a back nut which can be screwed thereon, and a clamping ring which has at 

its first end a flange engaging over the end surface of the pipe and a radial clamping ring 
sealing surface facing the union sealing surface and whose second end having a smaller wall 

thickness can be compressed on to the pipe under the action of the back nut, wherein a first 
elastic seal of an elastomer is provided between the two radial sealing surfaces and a second 

elastic seal of an elastomer is provided in an internal annular groove of the clamping ring, 
bearing on the outer surface of the pipe, characterized in that an annular recess (10) for the 

first elastic seal (11) is provided in the end face of the first clamping ring end (6a) radially 
within the clamping ring sealing surface (9), extending radially outwards from the inner 

periphery (8a) of the flange (8) and terminating at a distance from the outer periphery (6c) 
of the clamping ring (6) so as to leave an annular sealing margin (12) surrounding the first 

seal (11), in that the whole region of the flange (8) and the inside of the clamping ring (6d) 
lying between the two seals (11, 14) is clad by an elastic sealing layer (15), which forms a 

connected, one-piece sealing element (16) together with the two seals (11, 14), and in that 
a compression ring (18) is provided between the clamping ring (6) and a flange (4) 

provided on the end of the back nut (3) remote from the connector union (1) and directed 
radially inwards, the compression ring having an internal cone (19) acting on the second 

end (6b) of the clamping ring (6) and a radial annular shoulder bearing on the flange (4) of 
the back nut (3). 
A screw pipe coupling according to claim 1, characterized in that the recess (10) 
has a greater axial depth in the region of the first seal (11) than in the region of the flange 

(8) of the clamping ring (6). 
A screw pipe coupling according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the sealing 
element (16) is extruded on to the clamping ring (6).  

 
A screw pipe coupling according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the sealing 
element (16) is vulcanised on to the clamping ring (6). 
A screw pipe coupling according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
wall thickness of the clamping ring (6) is weakened in a region between the second seal 

(14) and its flange (8) by a groove (17) formed in the outer periphery of the clamping ring 
(6). 
A screw pipe coupling according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
compression ring (18) has a neck (21) adjoining the annular shoulder (20), which neck 

extends through the bore (4b) of the flange (4) of the back nut (3) and has at its outer end 
an outwardly directed collar (21) whose outer diameter is somewhat greater than that of 

the bore (4b).
