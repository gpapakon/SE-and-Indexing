 CONTAMINANT REMOVAL SYSTEM AND PROCESSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to a system and process for removing contaminants from a fluid environment. More particularly, this invention relates to a fluid clarification system and process for the removal of contaminants from a bulk fluid.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAerospace lubricating fluids require the removal of contaminants by a system that is operable under harsh working conditions, e.g., such a system must be capable of withstanding extremes of temperature and sudden changes in pressure differential. In addition, a fluid clarification system for aerospace lubricating fluids must make efficient use of volume and weight, due to the economic and physical constraints associated with flight.For example, aircraft power generators, commonly referred to as integrated drive generators, and aerospace hydraulic systems utilize oils for lubrication and motive power under highly demanding conditions. Lubricating oils include various forms of petroleum distillates, synthetic oils, shale and coal derived oils. Synthetic oils, e.g. ester, phosphate, silicone, glycol or polyphenyl ether based oil, are frequently utilized as lubricants where extreme operating conditions are encountered. Synthetic oils, particularly ester based oils, are frequently employed as lubricants in aerospace integrated drive generators where elevated temperatures and severe load conditions dictate the 

 use of an oil capable of withstanding extended exposure to elevated temperatures. Ester based synthetic oils, for example, exhibit very high viscosity, high flash points, low volatility, and exceptionally low pour points compared with petroleum based oils, making them especially suitable for use in integrated drive generators. Aerospace hydraulic systems, where severe load conditions are encountered, often utilize phosphate based synthetic oils, wherein the oil acts as both the hydraulic fluid and the hydraulic system lubricant.Lubricating oils used in such applications are frequently contaminated with water. Typically, it is such contamination that initiates corrosion processes, which lead to the breakdown of metal components unless controlled. For example, under the operating conditions of integrated drive generators, typically up to about 250° F, water reacts with lubricating oils to chemically degrade the oil and increase corrosion rates of internal metal components. Water also hydrolyzes ester based synthetic oils forming alcohol and acid, which in turn lead to increased rates
