The jet pipe further comprises means for selectively altering in flight the position of the end ridge constituting the focal point (19) of the jet pipe as well as the position of the throat (21) by acting on the second main profiled wall which constitutes a jet pipe lower profile the geometry of which can be varied with respect to the body of the aerospace vehicle.
