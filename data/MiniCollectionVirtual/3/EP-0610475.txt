<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a new nerve-derived transglutaminase enzyme that converts immune-derived IL-2 to dimeric IL-2 having oligodendrocyte cytotoxic activity. Both the nerve-derived transglutaminase and the dimeric mammalian, e.g. human, IL-2, are for use as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions for inducing and facilitating regeneration of injured nerves of the central nervous system in mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new nerve-derived
transglutaminase (designated hereinafter TGN).The invention
further relates to the preparation of said enzyme TGN and
of a dimeric IL-2 having oligodendrocyte cytotoxic
activity, and to their use for inducing and facilitating
nerve regeneration in mammals.Adult nerves of the mammalian central nervous system
(CNS) show poor regenerative ability after axonal injury.
Spontaneous growth of injured axons does occur, but ceases
after a few hundred microns without traversing the site of
the injury and elongating in the distal stump. The failure to
regenerate has been attributed to the inhospitable nature of
the nerve's environmental milieu, including the inability of
astrocytes (the scar-forming cells) to support growth, the
paucity of macrophages and/or their products, and the
formation of mature oligodendrocytes which inhibit axonal
growth. We recently showed that in a spontaneously regenerating
system, e.g., adult fish optic nerve, both the response to
injury and the process of regeneration are associated with
the presence of a factor(s), that we designated
oligodendrocyte cytotoxic factor (OCF), which is selectively
cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes of both fish and rate
(Published European Application EP No. 415321; Cohen et al.,
1990; Sivron et al., 1991). This fish-derived factor was
later identified by us as an IL-2-like molecule, with a
molecular weight of 28 kDa as compared to 15 kDa in human
immune IL-2 and 14 kDa in fish lymphocyte-derived IL-2
(Published European Application EP No. 501445; Eitan et al.,
1992). This difference in molecular weight between OCF and
IL-2 raised questions with regard to the origin of the
factor, i.e., whether it is locally modified IL-2 - derived
from resident cells in the nerve or from inflammatory cells -
or the product of a gene distinct from the gene encoding for
immune IL-2 but sharing high homology with it.It has now been found according to the present invention
that an enzyme, identified as a member of the
transglutaminase family and found at elevated levels after
optic nerve injury in the fish but not in mammals, plays a
role in modifying IL-2, possibly by cross-linkage of two
molecules, in much a way as to produce the high molecular
weight IL-2-like substance observed in the injured fish optic
nerve. This new nerve-derived transglutaminase, herein
designated TGN, causes dimerization of IL-2, thereby
rendering it cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes. The invention provides means and a method
for enzymatically producing
