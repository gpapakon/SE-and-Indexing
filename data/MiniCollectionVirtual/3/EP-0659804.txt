<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphate-modified
organo(poly)siloxanes which are useful as a component of
toiletries (perfumes and cosmetics), and further to a
process for producing phosphate-modified
organo(poly)siloxanes, which is suitable for the
manufacture of said organo(poly)siloxanes which are modified
by phosphates at the terminal ends and/or in the polymer
chain.Organopolysiloxanes (silicone oils) are commonly
used as a component of hair-finishing agents, as well as
a component of various cosmetics, because they impart no
greasy feeling and are highly safe. Recently, in
addition to the conventional use as a component of
cosmetics, application of these compounds as a component
of various toiletry items including perfumes has been
studied. In order to conform to these new applications,
further improvements in the characteristics of
organopolysiloxanes, such as compatibility, resistance to
chemicals, solubility in water, and lubricity,
are required.To satisfy these requirements, various 
organopolysiloxanes modified by introducing different
functional groups, for example, amino-modified, epoxy-modified,
carboxylic acid-modified, mercapto-modified,
alcohol-modified, polyether-modified, fluoroalkyl-modified,
alkyl-modified, ester-modified, and alkoxy-modified
organopolysiloxanes have been studied and
developed.On the other hand, phosphoric esters of organic
hydroxy compounds (including alkali metal salts thereof)
are known to have an excellent surface
activity. In particular, phosphoric monoesters are known
to exhibit much higher surface activity than phosphoric
diesters. For example, alkali metal salts or alkanol
amine salts of phosphoric monoester of a long chain alkyl
alcohol are water-soluble, and their aqueous solutions
exhibit strong foaming capability and detergency, while
the salts of phosphoric diester are scarcely soluble in
water, exhibit almost no foaming capability, and moreover
cause defoaming activity.As compounds which have both the characteristics of
the above-described phosphoric esters of organic hydroxy
compounds and the aforementioned modified
organopolysiloxanes, USP 5,070,171 and USP 5,093,452
disclosed certain compounds in which salts of phosphoric
ester are introduced to the silicon atoms of the siloxane
bonds in its main chain (excluding the both ends) via a 
lower alkylene group (limited only to the group having 3
carbon atoms) or polyalkyleneoxy groups, as connective
groups, using 115% phosphoric acid, phosphorus pentoxide,
or polyphosphoric acid.However, the
