 TIME DELAY BEAM FORMATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:1. Field of the Invention:The present invention relates to a system for generating and rapidly changing the time delays of electrical signals for true time delay beam formation and steering.2. Description of Related Art:The use of wide aperture, wide bandwidth phase steered array antennas for transmitting and receiving wideband signals is a known technique. Such known antennas suffer from a problem of beam dispersion or broadening when steering away from the array normal- Attempts have been made to avoid this problem of beam dispersion through the use of time delays between the array elements. One approach for implementing true time delay beam formation is to switch in different lengths of signal transmission delay lines between the common signal source and the antenna array elements. This known approach tends to be bulky and cumbersome for scanning an array with a large number of array elements over a wide range of nearly continuous angles.It is an object of the present invention to provide a system that is simple and that does not require a bulky and complex implementation. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system for implementing true time delay beam formation that may fit into a small lightweight package, that is relatively rugged, and that consumes relatively small amounts of power. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:In accordance with the present invention, these and other objectives are achieved by providing a system in which time delays may be generated by using an acousto-optic (AO) Bragg cell as a continuous tapped delay line. Selected points in the Bragg cell may be optically mapped to the output. The optical mapping may be controlled using additional optical and acousto-optical devices. The optical mapping may make use of prisms and/or holographic optical elements, in addition to other standard passive optical elements.A system in accordance with the present invention is capable of generating and rapidly changing time delays for true time delay beam formation and steering. A system in accordance with the present invention enables a time delay beam formation array to simultaneously scan multiple beams rapidly over a continuum of angles. A system in accordance with the present invention may be used, for example, in airborne reconnaissance and surveillance, space-based radar, satellite communications, or large space-based arrays, where size, weight and power are major considerations.A system in accordance with the present
