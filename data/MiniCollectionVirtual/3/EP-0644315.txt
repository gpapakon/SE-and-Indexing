<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a process for treating, with a hydrocarbon
blend oil wells in order to remove
asphaltenic deposits.Crude oil is a complex mixture of paraffinic,
cycloparaffinic and aromatic hydrocarbons, in which
components are present which have a wide range of
properties: in fact, the present species range from
very fluid liquids to waxy solids and very high
viscosity tars.Among the solid, or very thick, components, the
asphaltenes predominate. They consist of a variable-composition
mixture of fused aromatic polycyclic
compounds.Owing to the presence of various metals and
heteroatoms, such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur,
asphaltenes are among most polar components of crude
oil.In crude oil the asphaltenic particles tend to
form micelles, generally of spherical shape and having
a diameter comprised within the range of from 30 to 60
Angstroms, wherein the asphaltenes constitute the
central core of said micelles.Lighter aromatic compounds and polar products
surround the core of the micelle, favouring the
dissolution of asphaltenes in oil.The recovery of crude oil contained in geological
formations is often prevented by the presence of solid 
asphaltenic deposits. In fact, during the exploitation
of an oil well, high molecular weight asphaltenic
compounds can often precipitate together with waxy
solids.These solids tend to occlude the pores of the
rocky reserve of oil, and, furthermore, to block well
casings, pipes and further equipment used in borehole
drilling. As a consequence, the productivity of well
decreases and, in extreme cases, the total loss of
well production occurs.Several useful methods are known for removing the
above said solid deposits, e.g., mechanical scraping,
hot oil treatment, treatment with aqueous surfactant
solutions. However, the most widely used technique
consists in using organic solvents capable of
dissolving the above said asphaltenic deposits.For that purpose, the generally used solvents are
light aromatic species, e.g., benzene, toluene and
xylene.Besides their considerably high cost, the above
said solvents display very serious drawbacks, deriving
from their high volatility and their low flash point.
Furthermore, the above said aromatic compositions are
not completely satisfactory, owing to their poor
capability of dissolving the asphaltenic residues, and
to the rather low kinetics of dissolution thereof.DE-A-2047684 discloses a process for removing asphaltenic
deposits, which includes the treatment of the oil well with
a solvent containing over 90 vol.%

<CLAIMS>
Process for dissolving asphaltenic formations in oil wells.
characterised in that said process consists of the following steps:


a) pumping into said oil wells a hydrocarbon blend, said hydrocarbon
blend having an initial boiling point higher than 150°C; said hydrocarbon

blend consisting of a composition selected from those which, on a ternary
chart, in which the vertex (A) represents 100% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6,
the vertex (B) represents 100% of saturated species, and the vertex (C)

represents 100% of alkylbenzenes with z = -6, fall within the region defined
by a triangle defined by:

the vertex (A), i.e. 100% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6, the point along the side
AB, corresponding to 77% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6 and 23% of saturated
species, and the point along the side AC, corresponding to 45% of

alkylbenzenes and 55% of polyaromatics with z is 
<
6;
b) allowing said oil wells to stand for a time period of a few hours and
c) purging said oil wells.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that said hydrocarbon
blend has an initial boiling point higher than 180°C and it consists of a

composition selected from those which, on a ternary chart, in which the
vertex (A) represents 100% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6, the vertex (B)
represents 100% of saturated species, and the vertex (C) represents 100%

of alkylbenzenes with z = -6, fall within the region defined by a triangle
defined by:

the vertex (A), i.e. 100% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6, the point, along the
side AB, corresponding to 80% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6 and 20% of
saturated species, and the point, along the side AC, corresponding to 45%

of alkylbenzenes and 55% of polyaromatics with z 
<
-6.
