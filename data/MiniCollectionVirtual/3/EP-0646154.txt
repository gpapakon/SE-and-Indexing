<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of alkyl aryl 
phthalate plasticizers in water-blown polyurethane foams to 
produce a flexible foam. More specifically, this 
invention relates to the use of these phthalate 
plasticizers 
in water-blown polyurethane 
foams produced using p,p'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate 
(MDI). Polyurethane foams and methods for producing 
them are generally selected based upon the 
contemplated end use. Polyurethane foams produced 
from the reaction of polyols and toluene diisocyanate 
(TDI) are generally soft and flexible and they have 
thus been used when flexibility is required. In the 
past, greater than 80% of the toluene diisocyanate 
produced has been used to produce flexible foams. 
Polyurethane foams produced from the reaction of 
polyols and diphenylmethane diisocyanate are generally 
rigid and they have been used when strength and 
support have been required. In the past, 75% of the 
diphenylmethane diisocyanate produced has been used to 
produce rigid foams. To produce a foam during the reaction of the 
polyol and the isocyanate, a foaming or blowing agent 
must be included in the reaction mixture. 
Fluorocarbon compounds, such as 
trichlorofluoromethane, have been used because they 
expand easily when heated and they do not react with 
the polyol and isocyanate. Fluorocarbon compounds 
continue to be used in the production of rigid foams; 
however, methylene chloride has displaced some of the 
fluorocarbon compounds in the production of flexible 
foams. Water is also used as a foaming agent. Water 
reacts with the isocyanate to form an unstable acid 
which decomposes into carbon dioxide that creates the  
 
desired foaming. However, the reaction of the water 
and isocyanate has an undesired affect upon the 
reaction of the isocyanate and polyols such that the 
polyurethane produced is more rigid, or harder, than 
it would be if the water were not present. This 
undesired hardening of the foam has limited the use of 
water as the foaming agent in the production of 
flexible polyurethane foams. In Japanese patent application 59-226034, 
published December 19, 1984, a method for 
manufacturing a foamed urethane molded article is 
described. A urethane foam is produced from the 
reaction of a polyol and an isocyanate compound using 
both a fluorocarbon compound and a small amount of 
water as the foaming agents. Both toluene 
diisocyanate (TDI) and 
p,p'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) were used as 
the isocyanate compound. A phthalic acid plasticizer, 
such as the
