<ABSTRACT>
Method and electrode assemblies for using or installing an electrode (especially enzyme electrode) in vivo, in which a protecting medium is introduced at the installation site to suppress adverse effects on the electrode's output. The medium is preferably an isotonic solution (e.g. saline) and/or a buffer solution and/or an anti-coagulant, and may be of increased viscosity (e.g. a gel or hydrogel), and may be coated on the electrode assembly. The preferred electrode assembly is a needle within a trocar cannula, preferably with the needle tip set back to form a recess to contain gelled medium which can then be fed with liquid medium. The assembly can be made as a sterilised, sealed pack bearing calibration and/or other data relevant to its use, especially in machine-readable form.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Electrode.This invention relates to improvements relating to monitoring systems, and more particularly to improvements relating to systems for monitoring various body parameters, and. especially tissue parameters, in vivo by use of electrodes- It is known to use electrodes as part of systems for monitoring a variety of parameters in biological conditions or in biological products or materials, especially as sensors. An especially useful form of electrode for such purposes is in the monitoring of glucose in body fluids, for example in blood or tissue, and to do this either with samples taken from a subject and studied in vitro or by use of the electrode sensor in vivo.However, though such electrodes work well in vitro there is a major problem in in vivo use which arises from the time required for the stabilisation of the electrode â€” i.e. the time required for the signals from the electrode, when placed in vivo, to reach a condition in which the signals cease changing even though the environment around the electrode is not changing. This time delay can be as much as several hours, which effectively prevents use under conditions requiring rapid deployment. Also, in the case of electrodes measuring glucose or other components involving an oxidation/reduction process, there can be a considerable depression of the signal response under in vivo conditions, so that there is poor correlation between the signals and measurements of the same amounts or concentrations of analytes under in vivo and in vitro conditions.It can be seen that such effects are not satisfactory for accurate use in vivo and can restrict severely the usefulness of such electrodes under in vivo conditions despite their otherwise valuable properties when used under in vitro conditions.There is, therefore, a considerable need for some form of the electrodes or method of use or which can overcome these disadvantages and allow reliable and convenient use in vivo. The reason for this "read-out" depression of the signal from the electrode is not known, but we believe it arises from some barrier or interference to its activity which is set up when the 

electrode is put directly into contact with compact biological tissues when it is introduced into a bodily environment.We have now found that these disadvantages can be overcome by introducing a liquid medium into the site in vivo at which the ' electrode is to be used, so that the liquid medium introduced can produce an compatible environment for the electrode. This may be as a prelude to the

CLAIMS :
1. A method for using or installing an electrode in place in vivo which comprises the step of providing, at the site of introduction of the said electrode, a protecting medium which, without injuring the biological environment, suppresses the adverse depressive effect on the electrode's output induced by the hostile biological environment when it has not been modified by the protecting medium. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the protecting medium is then modified or rep-laced by an aqueous surrounding medium which allows the electrode to become exposed to the bodily biochemical changes of the surrounding environment which is to be monitored. 3. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the protecting medium or aqueous surrounding medium which allows the electrode to become exposed to the bodily biochemical changes of the surrounding environment which is to be monitored, is one or more of the following:- (a) an isotonic solution, subs antially isotonic with the in vivo medium to be monitored; (b) a buffer solution, compatible with the in vivo medium to be monitored, to avoid large pH changes which in turn may affect the electrode signal size; and/or (c) an anti-coagulant, which serves to reduce the chances of coagulation over the surface of the electrode or any part of its structure (e.g. over its membrane) .
4. A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the isotonic solution
(a) is an aqueous saline (sodium chloride) solution, optionally containing one or more additives.
5. A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the buffer solution
(b) is based on phosphates and is aimed at producing or maintaining a pH of about 7.0 to 7.8.
6. A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5 wherein the protecting medium or aqueous surrounding medium is an isotonic buffer solution.
7. A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the 


 protecting medium or aqueous surrounding medium contains one or more components which dissolve oxygen and so can serve as reservoirs for oxygen to prevent oxygen starvation and/or the oxygen and/or co-factors necessary for the functioning of an oxidase-based enzyme electrode.
8. A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7 wherein the protecting medium or aqueous surrounding medium contains an "active" component in a "slow-release" or other form (for example a liposome enclosing the relevant active ingredient or ingredients) which can reduce re-absorption by the circulation.
9. A method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 8 wherein the protecting medium or aqueous surrounding medium contains contains a material which can raise the viscosity of the liquid, either by simply increasing the viscosity or by forming a gel or hydroge.l.
