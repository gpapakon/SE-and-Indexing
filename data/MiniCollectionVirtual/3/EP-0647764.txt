<ABSTRACT>
A well treating tool string run on 
coiled tubing (19) and having packers (28,29) to isolate a zone to 

be treated in response to operation of a selector valve, pressure and temperature transducers in 
the tool string and a telemetry system which samples the measurements made by the transducers, 

an electrical conductor cable extending from the telemetry system up to the surface through the 
coiled tubing and to the inner end thereof 

on its storage reel (20), and a surface telemetry, data 
processing and display system that sends and receives encoded signals to and from the downhole 

telemetry system from which temperature and pressure values can be read out on the surface 
display in real time as the treating operation proceeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a new and improved tool string and methods
for use in treating an isolated zone in a well, and particularly to a tool string run
on coiled tubing and including a sensor package which monitors various
pressures and other variables and enables measurements thereof to be read out
at surface in real-time.A well completion tool mounted on the lower end of two concentric strings of
coiled tubing is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,417,827. A bundle of electrical
control lines extend from the tool upwardly through the innermost string of tubing
to recording and operating surface positioned equipment. By signals passing
through the electrical control lines and fluids delivered through the coiled tubing,
the apparatus during a single run into a well can log the formation, seal fluids
entering the well casing from perforations through the casing above and below
the tool, create multiple perforations, control treating of the formation with treating
fluids, permit fluid flow testing of the formation, consolidate formation sands,
temporarily or permanently seal perforations, and record well pressures and
temperatures.Canadian Patent 1 249 772 discloses a drill stem testing system for testing fluids
in subsurface regions surrounding a wellbore. The system transmits pressure 
and temperature data from a high pressure channel, an equalizing channel, and
the test region to the surface so that the testing procedure is continuously
monitored and so a pump may be appropriately actuated to keep the packers
properly inflated.Coiled tubing conveyed tool strings for treating well intervals or zones are known.
See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,913,231, Muller and Randermann, issued April
3,1990, which is incorporated herein by express reference. The running of tool
strings on coiled tubing has the advantage that there are no threaded joints to be
made up or broken out, so that the tools can be run much faster and at
considerably less expense. The 4,913,231 patent also discloses certain valve
subsystems for opening and closing various ports and pressure passageways
whereby inflatable packers can be expanded and retracted, and treating fluids
injected into a zone that is isolated by the packers. Although such systems and
subsystems represent considerable advances in the art, it would be highly useful
and advantageous to have real-time surface read out of the values of certain
downhole pressures, such as the pressure inside the coil tubing, hydrostatic
pressure, packer inflation pressures,
