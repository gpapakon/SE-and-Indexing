<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a liquid food product having a 
composition typical of ice cream, including edible fats, 

proteins, sugars and water, and including the steps of: 

preparing a basic mix including the above 
ingredients; 
cooling this mix to below its freezing point while 
whipping and injecting with gas until an aerated 

intermediate product is obtained, and subsequently 
heating it to above its freezing point and de-aerating it 

until the intermediate product is once again in a 
substantially de-aerate liquid state.; 
pasteurising or sterilising the product thus 
obtained, homogenising it and packaging it in aseptic 

containers. 
The process provides a product intended to be consumed 
liquid, which has similar organoleptic properties to 

conventional aerated solid or semi-solid ice cream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of a food product having a composition 
typical of ice cream but intended to be kept and eaten in 
a liquid state. Ice cream is a food product which is greatly valued, both 
for its nutritional value and for its organoleptic 
properties, and which includes fats, proteins, 
carbohydrates and water and which is rendered solid or 
semi-solid by freezing and whipping in such a way that 
small bubbles of air or inert gas are incorporated into 
the mass of the ice cream itself. Thanks to the presence 
of small bubbles of gas, the ice cream melts quickly in 
the mouth, giving a pleasant, fresh sensation. An extensive description of the technology and recipes 
for the preparation of conventional ice cream is given in 
the work of W.S. Arbuckle, The AVI Publishing Company 
Inc., 1977. Research carried out by the Applicant has shown that the 
flavour and organoleptic properties of ice cream depend 
essentially on the proportion of "unfreezables" trapped 
in the fine structure of ice crystals and gas bubbles. 
These unfreezables are made up of all those elements  
 
which are dissolved, emulsified or dispersed in the 
initial aqueous phase and which only special ice cream 
manufacturing technology manages to distribute in a 
pleasing and harmonious manner. A particular organoleptic effect on the receptors of the 
tongue and palate, linked to the high concentration of 
highly active substances (fats, proteins and sugars), is 
further enhanced by action that proteins exert at the 
interface of oil-in-water emulsions which improves the 
exchange between the "unfreezable portion" and the cell 
membranes of the receptors. The original oil/gas/water emulsion loses its gas phase 
on melting, the "pure ice" phase is quickly absorbed by 
saliva, while the proteins concentrated at the solution 
of unfreezables/oil interface contribute to the formation 
of a new oil/unfreezable/saliva emulsion which is 
absorbed slowly by the receptors, thus pleasantly 
prolonging the flavour and organoleptic effect. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
process which enables a food product to be produced which 
has the typical composition of ice cream, and therefore 
the same nutritional value, but is intended to be 
consumed as a drink in its liquid state, and which gives 
the consumer the same pleasant organoleptic sensation 
produced by conventional ice cream at the moment when the  
 
unfreezable portion, freed from the microbubbles of gas 
and the

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a liquid food 
product, having a composition typical of ice cream, 

including edible fats, proteins, sugars and water, 
characterised in that it includes the steps of: 


preparing a basic mix including the ingredients 
mentioned above; 
cooling the mix to below its freezing point while 
whipping and injecting it with gas until an aerated 

intermediate product is obtained, and subsequently 
heating it to above its freezing point and de-aerating it 

until the intermediate product is once again in a 
substantially de-aerate liquid state; 
pasteurising or sterilising the product thus 
obtained, homogenising it and packaging it in aseptic 

containers. 
A process according to Claim 1, in which the 
finished food product has a fat content of from 4 to 18% 

by weight, a protein content of from 3 to 7% and a sugar 
content of up to 30% by weight and total solid residue of 

28 to 45 % by weight. 
A process according to Claim 1 in which the finished 
product has a total solid residue of from 30 to 38% by 

weight. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, in  
 

which the basic mix includes thickening and stabilising 
agents chosen from the group comprising sodium alginate, 

propyleneglycol alginate, carrageen, carboxymethyl 
cellulose, starch, modified starch, pectin and 

phosphates. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which the basic mix is a concentrate having a total solid 

residue equal to 1.1-1.5 times the total solid residue of 
the desired finished product and in which an aqueous, 

edible diluent is added to the intermediate aerated 
product in sufficient quantity to reduce the total solid 

residue to the desired final value. 
A process according to Claim 4, in which the diluent 
is constituted by full-cream milk and in which the 

aerated intermediate product is dissolved in this diluent 
heated to a temperature of between 60 and 85Â°C.
