Use of an antigenic peptide chosen from the group constituted by the peptides 
which satisfy one of the following sequences: 


 
respectively designated in the appended list of sequences under numbers: SEQ. ID NO:1, 

SEQ.ID NO:11, SEQ. ID NO:10, SEQ. ID NO:9, SEQ. ID NO:8, SEQ. ID NO:7, 
SEQ. ID NO:6, SEQ. ID NO:2, for obtaining anti-CMP antibodies. 
An antigenic peptide characterised in that it consists of a peptide as defined in 
claim 1 provided with a cystine at its C-terminal end. 
An antigenic composition characterised in that it comprises as an essential 
constituent at least one peptide or peptide derivative chosen from the group constituted 

by: 

the peptides according to claim 2, 
the products of coupling a peptide as defined in either of Claims 1 or 2 with 
a carrier protein, 
the MAPs derived from a peptide as defined in either of claims 1 or 2. 
A method of preparing anti-CMP antibodies, the said method being 
characterised in that it comprises a stage during the course of which an animal is 

immunised with an antigenic composition or with a peptide according to Claim 3.  
 
Anti-CMP antibodies, characterised in that they are capable of being obtained 
by the method according to claim 4. 
Antibodies according to claim 5, characterised in that they are monoclonal 
antibodies. 
Antibodies according to claim 5, characterised in that they are polyclonal 
antibodies. 
A method permitting evaluation of the proteolysis of milk and dairy products, 
the said method being characterised in that it comprises at least one stage during the 

course of which an antibody according to claim 5, produced against a peptide satisfying 
one ofthe sequences: SEQ. ID NO:1, SEQ. ID NO:11, SEQ. ID NO:10, SEQ. ID NO:9, 

SEQ. ID NO:8, SEQ. ID NO:7 or SEQ. ID NO:6, is brought into contact with a sample 
of milk or dairy product to be tested and a stage in which the antigenic complex/antibody 

formed during the course of the preceding stage is revealed and/or quantitively measured 
by any appropriate means. 
A method of detecting the presence of CMP in cow's milk in milk and dairy 
products, the said method being characterised in that it comprises a stage during the 

course of which an antibody according to claim 5 produced against the peptide of 
sequence SEQ. ID NO:2 is brought into contact with a sample of milk or dairy product 

to be tested, and a stage in which the antigenic complex/antibody formed during the 
course of the preceding stage is revealed and/or quantitively measured by any appropriate 

means. 
Reagents for detecting or quantitively measuring CMP, the said reagents being 
characterised in that they comprise at least one anti-CMP antibody according to any one 

of claims 4 to 6.
