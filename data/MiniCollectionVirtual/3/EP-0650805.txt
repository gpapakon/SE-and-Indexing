<ABSTRACT>
An electric power tool (10), which is preferably constructed as an angle grinder, has a motor-driven hollow spindle (24) for driving a tool (29) which is secured between a clamping flange (28) and a counter-flange (26) by means of a quick-clamping device via a tension spindle (36) which is coaxial with the hollow spindle (24), is stressed in the axial direction via resilient elements (38) and is displaceable by means of a clamping lever (74) relative to the hollow spindle (24) in the axial direction between a clamping position (72), in which the tool (29) is clamped in between the flanges (26, 28) so as to be fixed against rotation, and a releasing position (70). The clamping lever (74) is mechanically coupled to the motor switch via a switching rod (82) in such a way that the clamping lever (74) is movable into the releasing position (70) only when the motor (16) is switched off. Maloperation and possible damage to the electric power tool are thus precluded.

Power tool, in particular right-angle grinder, with a hollow
spindle (24) driven by a motor (16) and a quick clamping

device to receive a tool (29) between a clamping
flange (28) and a counterflange (26), such that the quick

clamping device has a tension spindle (36), coaxial with
the hollow spindle (24), that is tensioned in the axial

direction by means of elastic elements (38) and is displaceable
in the axial direction relative to the hollow

spindle (24), by means of a clamping lever (74), between a
clamped position (72) in which the tool (29) is nonrotatably

retained between the flanges (26, 28), and a released
position (70) in which the flanges (26, 28) are disengaged

in the axial direction for manual changing of the tool
(29); and with a switch (110) to actuate the motor (16),

characterized in that the clamping lever (74) is coupled
to the switch (110) by means of a link rod (82) in such a

way that the clamping lever (74) can be moved into the released
position (70) only when the motor (16) is switched

off, in that a slider (96) is provided outside the motor
housing for shifting the link rod (82) and is fixed to the

link rod (82), and in that the link rod (82) is coupled to
the switch (110) for actuating the switch (110) when being

moved.
Power tool according to claim 1, characterized in that
the clamping lever (74) is mechanically coupled to the

switch (110), by means of the link rod (82), in such a
way that the switch (110) can be actuated to switch on 

the motor (16) only when the clamping lever (74) is in
the clamped position.
Power tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the link rod (82) to actuate the switch (110) is arranged

displaceably between an activated position and a
deactivated position in the lengthwise direction of the

link rod (82), which is preferably perpendicular to the
axial direction; and wherein at least one interlock element,

which in the activated position is interlocked with
a counterelement, is arranged between link rod (82) and

clamping lever (74).
Power tool according to one or more of the foregoing
claims, characterized in that the clamping lever (74) is

pivotably mounted at a first end (78) about an axis (80)
and has an eccentric element (66) which acts via a pusher

stud (52) on a pusher element (42) in order to displace
the tension spindle (36) in the axial direction (99) between

the clamped position (72) and released position
(70) as the clamping lever (74) pivots.
Power tool according to claim 4, characterized in that
the first end (78) of the clamping lever (74) has at

least a first recess (84) into which a projection (86) of
the link rod (82) can be inserted in the lengthwise direction

(101) to interlock the clamping lever (74) in the
clamped position (74). 
Power tool according to claim 5, characterized in that a
second recess (88) into which a second projection (90),

extending in the lengthwise direction (101) of the link
rod (82), can be inserted in the clamped position (72),

is provided in the region of the free end (76) of the
clamping lever (74).
Power tool according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that a projection (92) that extends substantially perpendicularly

from the second recess (88) and, with the
clamping lever (74) in a position pivoted only slightly

with respect to the clamped position (72), blocks the
second projection (90) of the link rod (82) to prevent

advancement of the link rod into the activated setting,
is provided in the region of the free end (76) of the

clamping lever (74).
Power tool according to one or more of the foregoing
claims, characterized in that the link rod (82) is configured

in multiple parts.
Power tool according to claim 8, characterized in that
the link rod (82) has a front part (102) facing the quick

clamping device, and a rear part (104), which can be
snap-locked together.
Power tool according to one or more of the foregoing
claims, characterized in that the link rod (82) is made,

at least in the front region facing the quick clamping
device, of an electrically insulating material, in particular

of plastic. 
Power tool according to one or more of claims 2 to 10,
characterized in that the link rod (82) is pushed elastically

via a spring element (118) in the direction of the
deactivated setting.
Power tool according to one or more of claims 4 to 11,
characterized in that a brake disk (54) that, with the

clamping lever (72) in the released position (70), interacts
as a braking device to decelerate the hollow spindle

(24), is provided opposite the end surface (55) of the
hollow spindle (24) facing the clamping lever (72).
Power tool according to claim 12, characterized in that a
pusher plate (44) is arranged on the pusher element (42)

and joined positively to the hollow spindle (24), the
surface of the pusher plate (44) facing the pusher stud

(52) being configured as a friction surface (50).
Power tool according to claim 12 or 14, characterized in
that the pusher stud (52) is fastened positively in the

gear drive housing (12) to prevent rotation.
