<DESCRIPTION>
 Ion-sens1t1ve callxarenes Field of the InventionThe invention relates to ion-sensitive compounds. More particularly, the invention relates to ion-sensitive compounds comprising a receptor designed to bind anionic species by the formation of a receptor-substrate complex. Background of the InventionAnion receptors comprising a plurality of quaternary amine groups are known. Examples of such compounds may be seen in P.G. Potvin and J-M Lehn, Prog. Macrocyclic Chern . , 1987, 3, 214.L.A. Summers, "The Bipyridinium Herbicides", Academic Press, New York, 1980, describes the use of certain compounds comprising, diquaternary 2,2'- bipyridinium moieties in herbicidal applications.Metal ion centres have also been utilised in systems for the recognition of anions as described in D.N. Reinhoudt, J.Am. Chem . Soc. 1992, 114, 9671-9673. Problem to be solved by the InventionThere is a continuing need to provide new receptor compounds for a variety of applications. For example, there is a need for compounds which can be incorporated in electrochemical or optical sensors for anion determination. There is also a need for compounds which can be used in removal devices where levels of a given anion need to be kept low.It is also desirable to provide receptor compounds which can be readily synthesised. Summary of the InventionThe ion-sensitive compounds of the invention have the formula A^+B^- wherein A represents a cation capable of forming a receptor-substrate complex with an anion, and B represents one or more counter anions. 

characterised in that the cation is an anion receptor represented by the formula ICH2CONH CH2CONH nor by the formula IICH-CONH CH2CONH
 whereinR1, R2, R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, an alkylamido group, an arylamido group, an alkylsulfonamido group, an arylsulfonamido group or a nitro group; R5 and R^ are each independently H or a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or R5 and R^ taken together represent an ethylene bridging group; and, n is 0 or 1. The invention also provides a method of sensing an anion in solution by contacting the anion with a compound comprising a cation which is a 

receptor for the anion to form a receptor-substrate complex and sensing a detectable change which results from the formation of the complex characterised in that the compound is a compound of the invention. Advantageous effect of the InventionThe compounds of the invention show selectivity to anions
