<ABSTRACT>
The device combines heating, ventilating or air-conditioning aeraulic and thermal equipment with a technique for distributing air using novel constituents in this application. The device eliminates the equipment of the duct or plug type which are characteristic of whole-air conditioners. It creates a horizontal technical duct which is accessible and demountable and is available over the totality of the surface of the premises. A ventilation unit (1) blows, above a false ceiling made of impervious stretched fabric (2), the air pretreated in the power unit (1). This air (8) is distributed and retreated by transfer modules (3) towards the blowing volumes above a false ceiling made of permeable fabric (4). The latter provides the homogeneous distribution of the air (8) over the entire surface of the treated premises (5). A recovery grille (6) provides the recycling of air (8) towards the circulation room (7).

Air distribution device, for heating ventilation or air 
conditioning, whose air ductwork side walls are formed by 

suspended ceilings (2, 4), completed by upper floor slabs (13) 
and the vertical walls (14) of the rooms. The main feature of 

the device is the use of partly permeable streched material for 
the side walls of the suspended ceiling (4) working as an air 

channel. 
A device following the previous claim is characterized by 
the fact that the permeable part (4) of suspended ceilings forms 

an air outlet on the whole of its surface. 
A device following claim 1) which is characterized by the 
fact that the suspended ceiling of this type (2) consists of an 

air-tight material which acts as air distribution side wall. 
A device corresponding to the claims 1), 2) and 3), 
characterized by the fact that the texture material making up 

suspended ceilings (2) or (4) is exclusively fastened on frames 
located on the upper side borders of the vertical walls of the 

room. 
A device following claims 1) and 2), characterized by the 
fact that a type of facility, corresponding to the structure of 

a single volume room, includes a suspended ceiling made up of 
stretched air-tight material (4) located at upper level room 

serviced (5), a volume (19) limited by the suspended ceiling (4) 
an upper floor slab (13) and the vertical walls (14), a 

ventilation and air processing unit (1) installed inside the 
space previously mentioned (19) and which drives the conditioned 

air into the room (19) via the net filter (10).  
 
A device following requirements 1), 2) and 3) whose type 
of assembly, suitable for a multi-room structure, includes a 

suspended ceiling (2) made air-tight stretched material situated 
upper level of circulation room (17), a volume (18) limited by 

the suspended ceiling (2), the upper floor slab (13) and the 
walls or room partitions (14), a ventilation or air processing 

unit (1) located in the previously mentioned volume (18), which 
is equipped at its air inlet with a filter (10) set into a 

frame (25) fixed to the suspended ceiling (2), modules for the 
transfer of air (3) placed within the volume mentioned (18) and 

the various other volumes (19) located each time above at the 
upper level of the ventilated or air conditioned rooms (5) 

limited by the upper floor slabs (13) the walls or partition 
walls (14) and an air permeable suspended ceiling (4), air 

filters (16) mounted at the outlet of transfer module (3), the 
previously mentioned volumes (19), the previously mentioned air 

permeable material ceilings (4), air recovering grilles (6) 
fitted into the lower part of the doors or walls (14) of the 

rooms (5).
