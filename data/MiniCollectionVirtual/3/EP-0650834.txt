<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
washing the deck of a press or coater and, more particularly to
one having an enclosed doctor blade chamber for metering the
solution onto a roll such as a flexographic anilox roll or a
gravure roll. For convenience, the ensuing description will be
in terms of a flexographic press.The wash-up of a deck (the fountain and anilox roll) of
a flexographic press has been time-consuming and costly.
Whenever the ink is changed (for color, consistency, etc.), the
old ink must be removed and this is a chore that no one likes.
Wash-up has been considered to be the biggest part of a job
changeover.In the past, it has been necessary to circulate up to
76 litres
(20 gallons) of solvent to completely clean a deck. The solvent
flows through the fountain chamber, being confined by the
rotating anilox roll which also requires cleaning. During
wash-up, the solids content in the solvent rises to quickly
reach an equilibrium so large volumes of solvent have been 
necessary.A further complication lies in the fact that to get the
job done efficiently, high flow rates are employed, particularly
for creating turbulent flow so as to thoroughly cleanse the
chamber. However, the end seals normally employed are capable
of withstanding only slight pressure, i.e., of the order of 254 to 381 Pa (10
to 15" H2O). A higher flow rate can cause leakage past the end
seals. Therefore, the wash-up job has taken longer than
desired.According to the invention,
which is defined in the appended claims,
fresh or once used solvent
is drawn into the valve-equipped system while the remaining ink
or waste solvent is being pumped into the waste receiver. Once
the system has been so charged, valves shift allowing the pump
to circulate the solvent through a closed circuit or loop which
allows the highly desirable higher flow rates. Also, the pump
rotation can be repetitively cycled between forward and reverse
directions to enhance the cleaning action of the solvent. The
solvent may be any fluid used to dilute the ink components and
carry away the ink solids -- for example, water for a
water-based ink.The system then may be recharged with fresh solvent
where once used solvent has been employed. Thereafter the
system is drained of solvent which is replaced by air. In this
way nearly all components of the inking system (hoses, pump,
anilox roll, doctor blade chamber, valves, fittings, etc.) are
automatically cleaned and made ready for the next printing job. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, it
