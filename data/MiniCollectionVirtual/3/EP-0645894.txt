<ABSTRACT>
A decoder, intended to be used in a receiver of such a transmission system, further includes a module (10A) making it possible to calculate the distance between each point received and the point which is the closest to it in each subset of the two-dimensional constellation used. The distance used is a relative distance given by the following function #:

A transmission system using block-coded or trellis-coded modulations
based on a 2N-dimensional QAM constellation divided into sub-sets, and comprising a

transmitter (110) and a receiver (120) which is provided with a decoder (125) for
decoding said modulations, said decoder also comprising a module (10A) allowing

calculation of a distance between each received sample and the point which is closest
thereto in each sub-set of the two-dimensional constellation, characterized in that the

distance 
 used is a relative distance given by a function 
 of the following variables:

the index i indicates that this is the abscissa (i=x) or the ordinate (i=y) of the
quantity indicated,
Δ represents a displacement vector between two points of the constellation,
E is the error separating the point received from the point which is closest thereto in
the two-dimensional constellation,
sgn() indicates the sign function.
A transmission system as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the
relative distance 
 used is calculated from an expression of the type:

A transmission system as claimed in any one of claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that, when the original constellation is subdivided into at most eight

sub-sets, the relative distance 
 is obtained through calculation of expressions of the
type:

i
|)
 
when |Δ
i
| is equal to 1, and through calculation of expressions of the type
