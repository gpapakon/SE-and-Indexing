<ABSTRACT>
Novel precipitated calcium carbonate particles in clustered form, which when used as fillers impart improved strength, opacity and other advantages to paper, are prepared by a process involving adding lime and carbon dioxide to a reaction mixture containing seed material having a scalenohedral morphology, the lime and carbon dioxide being added simultaneously. The flow rates of the lime and carbon dioxide are adjusted to control the solution conductivity of the reaction mixture to between about 2.0 and about 4.0 mS to form the clusters of calcite particles, the clusters having an average equivalent spherical diameter of between about 1.5 and 3.5 microns and a specific surface area of between about 2.0 and 9.0 m

<DESCRIPTION>
 CLUSTERED PRECIPITATED CALCIUMCARBONATE PARTICLES This invention relates to novel precipitated calcium carbonate particles in clustered form, a substantial proportion of said particles having a prismatic morphology, and to a method for their preparation.Calcium carbonate particles of varying sizes and shapes are among the most useful fillers in the paper-making art. These particles may be roughly divided into two groups, to wit: natural calcium carbonate particles, and precipitated calcium carbonate particles. Natural calcium carbonate is prepared by mechanically grinding limestone to particle sizes as small as 0.5 microns, although grinding limestone below one micron is exceedingly difficult. As a general rule, ground limestone particles are usually very irregular in shape, and ordinarily exhibit a broad particle size distribution.General methods for production of precipitated calcium carbonates are concerned with the slaking of lime (calcium oxide) , temperature of carbona ion, and rate of introduction of carbon dioxide into the slaked lime. By appropriately controlling the solution 

environment, either calcite, aragonite, or vaterite is produced. Depending on the conditions of the environment, calcite can have either a prismatic, scalenohedral or rhombohedral crystal habit. Aragonite is acicular and takes the form of either single or clustered needles. Vaterite is generally spherical but is unstable and converts readily to calcite. The crystal morphologies of the products are determined by the concentration of calcium and hydroxyl ion in the specific solution environment during the nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate.Size control by varying slake and carbonation conditions is generally related closely to the resultant morphology and is usually limited to a relatively narrow range for each product.Morphology and size are also often significantly influenced by addition of various additives to slaked limes. This is illustrated by U.S. Patent 4,714,603 in which a synthesis for the preparation of spherical calcite particles is described wherein a dissolved polyphosphate is added to slaked lime prior to the introduction of carbon dioxide. Particle sizes of between 2.5 and 10.0 microns are disclosed with the size depending upon the quantity of polyphosphate added. Other additives such as polybasic organic acids and polysaccharides have also been found to exert some size control when they are added to lime prior to carbonation, the effect being dependent on the source, age and purity of the lime
