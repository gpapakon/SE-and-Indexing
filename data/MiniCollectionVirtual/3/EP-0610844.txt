<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers which have been prepared by copolymerisation of long-chain alpha -olefins with olefinically unsaturated acids and esters and, if desired, aromatic vinyl compounds are very highly suited to the economic production of aqueous emulsions. The emulsions themselves are suitable as care agents for floorings, motor vehicles, furniture and leather and for rendering materials hydrophobic, for finishing textiles, for coating glass, for the anti-corrosive preservation (rustproofing) of, for example, motor vehicles, as a protection for masonry and for sealing concrete.
