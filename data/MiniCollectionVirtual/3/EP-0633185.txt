<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aircraft tractor without a towbar having a chassis which is split by a hinge shaft (26) parallel to the axis. The retaining device for the nose undercarriage (nose wheels 27) of an aircraft is arranged inside the fork-shaped recess in the chassis, which recess is formed by the lifting beams (3). This retaining device consists of a lifting platform (7), a pendular crossmember, telescopic arms with gripping arms, a push-out crossmember, a transverse crossmember (5), longitudinal guides and a pendular bolt. The pendular crossmember, lifting platform (7) together with the telescopic arms including the push-out crossmember, the transverse crossmember (5) and the longitudinal guide are connected via coupling elements to the lifting beams (3) of the chassis rear part (2). The pendular crossmember has an oscillating bearing, and a pendular movement of the lifting platform (7) and pendular crossmember is ensured in conjunction with the lifting platform (7), which is mounted such that it can pivot. Since the adjustable-height telescopic arms are hinged on the lifting platform (7) and on the pendular crossmember such that they can pivot, they can take part in the pendular movement.

<CLAIMS>
Aircraft tug without a draw bar having a 
chassis (1, 2) which is divided by means of an 

axle-parallel articulated shaft (26), the driven 
front axle of which chassis is secured to a front 

part (1) and the rear axle gearing of which is 
secured to lifting links (3), as a result of which 

the rear part (2) of the chassis forms a fork-shaped 
recess for the nose landing gear (27) of 

the aircraft and wherein a device for 
accommodating the nose landing gear (27) consists 

of a lifting platform (7) with a supporting 
surface (8) for the nose wheels of the nose 

landing gear, a pendulum beam (6), telescoping 
arms (9) with gripping arms (10), a push-out beam 

(12), a transverse beam (5), longitudinal 
connecting rods (17) and a pendulum pin (18),
 
wherein the lifting platform (7), the pendulum 

beam (6) and the telescoping arms (9) are 
mechanically connected to the transverse beam (5) 

via the pendulum pin (18), such that said elements 
(7, 6, 9, 18, 5) can pivot to both sides about the 

longitudinal axis of the chassis,
 
wherein the longitudinal connecting rods (17) 

connect the lifting platform (7) to the front part 
(1) of the chassis and have degrees of freedom 

which are ensured by articulated bearings (20)  
 

which are arranged on the front part (1) and on 
the lifting platform (7), wherein the telescoping 

arms (9) are pivotable in the vertical direction 
in pivot bearings (22) on the pendulum beam (6),
 
wherein a rotational movement of the transverse 

beam (5) in the vertical direction is performed by 
means of pivot bearings (21),
 
wherein coupling members (4), for coupling the 

accommodating device to the lifting links (3) of 
the rear part (2) of the chassis are arranged such 

that they are vertically pivotable about bearings 
(23, 24) which are arranged on the transverse beam 

(5) and on the lifting links (3),
 
wherein the lifting links (3) are vertically 

pivotable by means of the articulated shaft (26), 
which is parallel to the front and rear axles of 

the aircraft tug, and the bearing (25),
 
wherein in the case of the pivoting movent of the 

pendulum beam (6) about the pendulum pin (18) the 
longitudinal connecting rods (17) deflect to the 

pivot side in each case and the lifting platform 
(7) performs a vertical pivoting movement via 

horizontal pivot bearings (19) which are connected 
in an articulated manner to the pendulum beam (6),
 
wherein the telescoping arms (9) with the gripping 

arms (10) can be pushed back and forth and the 
push-out beam (12) can be pushed back and forth 

with the aid of a displacement device (14),
  
 

wherein the push-out beam (12) and the 
displacement device (14) are mounted in an 

articulated manner by means of pivoting bearings 

(22) on the pendulum beam (6), and connected in an 
articulated manner to the lifting platform (7) in 

such a manner that their height may be 
continuously adjusted by means of setting members,
 
and wherein the transverse beam (5) is articulated 

on the front part (1) of the chassis by means of 
the pivot bearings (21). 
Aircraft tug according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the coupling members (4) are 

longitudinally adjustable.
