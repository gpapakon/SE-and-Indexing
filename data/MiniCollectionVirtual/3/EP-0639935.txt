<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connector for radiant heaters, such as are used in cookers with glass ceramic cooking plates (ceramic hobs). The connector according to the invention contains a number of improvements. For example, it is proposed that the welding lugs (8, 9), arranged at the connecting lugs (7), for the different installation positions of the connector are of identical length, starting from the imaginary axis B-B of rotation of the connector. In this way, the position of the welding points remains the same for each installation position. The dimensions of the connecting wires (10) and of a recess in the edge (12) of the insulating member always remain identical. Assembly aids in the basic member (1) of the connector permit the automatic fixing of the connecting wires (10) for the welding operation. Further innovations, as a whole, ensure that the connector has a reduced constructional depth and, as far as the connecting positions are concerned, can be used more universally.
