A plasma reactor for performing an etching or deposition method, 
said reactor including a vacuum enclosure (1) designed to receive a 

substrate (5) to be treated, and including means (3) for inserting a 
gas to be ionized, said enclosure being closed by a container (6) 

made of dielectric material, the plasma being produced in said 
container and being excited by an antenna (8) surrounding said 

container (6) and fed by a radio-frequency power generator (14), said 
plasma reactor being characterized in that said antenna is composed 

of an electrical conductor (9) that constitutes a single circular 
loop having two diametrically-opposite points (10, 11) connected to 

feed conductors (12, 13) connected to the radio-frequency power 
generator (14). 
A plasma reactor according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
radio-frequency power generator (14) feeds said antenna (8) via an 

impedance-matching circuit comprising a first variable capacitor (15) 
connected in series with a second variable capacitor (16) connected 

in parallel across the terminals of said antenna (8). 
A plasma reactor according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
a plurality of permanent magnets (21) are disposed around said vacuum 

enclosure (1), said magnets (21) being polarized radially and 
successively in opposite directions from one another. 
A plasma reactor according to any preceding claim, characterized 
in that a DC-powered electrical coil (22) is disposed around said 

enclosure (1), the axis of said coil being perpendicular to the plane 
of said antenna (8), the position of said coil being adjustable along 

said axis. 
A plasma reactor according to any preceding claim, characterized 
in that a DC-powered electrical coil (20) is disposed around said 

antenna (8), the axis of said coil (20) being perpendicular to the 
plane of the antenna (8).
