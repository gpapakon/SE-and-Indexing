<ABSTRACT>
The transmission system between two stations has a transmission coil (2,3) at each of the latter, with their axes perpendicular to one another during transmission, one of the coils providing a magnetic field which passes through the other coil. The first coil comprises 2 coil halves (3a,3b), each of which is semicircular and positioned above and below the perpendicular coil respectively. The 2 coil halves lie in a common plane and provide opposing magnetic fields.

<CLAIMS>
System for contactless data and/or power
transmission between a first coil (3a, 3b) enclosing a

lock barrel (1) and a second coil (4) arranged in a key
(2), which is inserted into the lock barrel,
characterized
in that the first coil is formed from two coil elements
(3a, 3b) connected in series, the main magnetic field

lines, running within the coil, of one coil element (3a)
running parallel to those of the other coil element (3b),
in that the coil elements (3a, 3b) generate mutually
opposite magnetic fields which complement one another to

form an annular field (5),
in that the axis of the second coil (4), with the key (2)
inserted into the lock barrel (1), runs perpendicularly

to the main magnetic field lines, running within the
coil, of the coil elements (3a, 3b) in every position,

and
in that the spatial assignment of the second coil (4) to
the coil elements (3a, 3b) is such that it is permeated

by the annular field (5) generated by the coil elements
(3a, 3b) in the event of a transmission.
