<ABSTRACT>
Optically transparent, high refractive index hydrogels are provided. Expansile hydrogel intraocular lenses (10) are fabricated from the hydrogels by heating them above their elastic deformation temperatures and deforming them into an elongated configuration having at least one reduced dimension (20) suitable for insertion through a small surgical incision. The lenses are allowed to cool in this configuration and retain the deformed shape prior to surgical implantation. Following implantation the lenses hydrate into an enlarged elastic form reassuming the original lens configuration of full capsule size.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH REFRACTIVE INDEX HYDROGELS AND USES THEREOFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 07/951,775, filed September 28, 1992.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to hydrogels. In one of its more particular aspects thi; invention relates to optically transparent high refractive index hydrogels useful for fabricating articles such as lenses, especially intraocular lenses suitable for implantation using small incision surgical techniques. More particularly, the present invention involves hydrogel intraocular lenses and methods for their deformation in a dehydrated state to a size which is sufficiently reduced for their small incision implantation following cataract surgery. Subsequent to surgical implantation, the deformed lenses hydrate within the ocular environment to full sized lenses.Description of Related ArtSince the early 1940's optical devices in the form of intraocular lenses have been utilized to replace the natural physiological crystalline ocular lens in humans and other mammals. Typically, the intraocular lens is implanted within the ocular environment immediately after surgically removing the natural lens which has become opaque or otherwise damaged by cataract formation or injury. For decades the most prevalently utilized materials for forming intraocular lenses were acrylates or 

methacrylates and particularly polymethylmethacrylate, a rigid, glassy polymer.More recently developed surgical techniques and improved instrumentation have made it possible to remove the opaque or damaged natural lens through incision sizes as small as 2 - 3 mm. This contrasts sharply with earlier methods which involved forming incisions up to 9 or 10 mm in length in order to remove the natural lens and insert the intraocular lens. Because small incision surgery is much less traumatic for patients and decreases complications and healing time, this technique has become the method of choice for a large number of ophthalmic surgeons.Since full-size intraocular lenses have diameters in the range of 8-13 mm, far exceeding the 2 - 3 mm incision size, the standard rigid polymethylmethacrylate lenses are not suitable for direct implantation through the reduced incision sizes. Thus, a number of different intraocular lens designs and materials have been developed for use in connection with small incision surgical techniques. One approach utilizes the concept of preparing lenses from elastomeric materials such as silicones and thermoplastic
