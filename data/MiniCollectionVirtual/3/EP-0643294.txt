<ABSTRACT>
The sample material (F) is illuminated and the light reflected from the sample material is measured, the presence of foreign matter being deduced from a change in the reflected light. In order to detect foreign matter which is darker than the sample material (F), the sample material is imaged on a sensor (5) in front of a bright background (4), and in order to detect brighter foreign matter, it is imaged in front of a dark background. Use in combination with an electronic yarn cleaner for the detection of foreign fibres in yarns.

Process for detecting foreign substances in a
textile test material of the yarn, roving or sliver type,

in which the test material is subjected to light, the
light reflected from the test material is measured and

the presence of a foreign substance is concluded from a
change in the reflected light, characterized in that an

image of the test material (F) is projected onto a sensor
(3) in front of a light background (4) for the detection

of darker foreign substances than the test material and
in front of a dark background (4) for the detection of

lighter foreign substances, and the signal of the said
sensor is compared with adjustable limit values, and in

that in the first case an undershooting of the respective
limit value and in the second case an overshooting of the

respective limit value by the signal is interpreted as
presence of the foreign substance sought.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, for the detection of darker and lighter foreign

substances, the background (4) is alternately illuminated
and not illuminated.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that switching to the respective limit value is carried

out synchronously with the changing of the illumination
of the background (4).
Device for carrying out the process according to
Claim 1, with means (5, 6) for illuminating the test

material and with a light-sensitive sensor (3) ,
characterized in that the sensor is formed by a line

sensor (3) and in that an illuminating means (7) is
provided for a background (4), which illuminating means 

is connected to a conrol stage (11) which alternately

switches the illuminating means (7) on and off.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the background is formed by a ground glass screen

(4) and in that a light source (7) is provided for the
optional illumination of the ground glass screen.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said light source (7) is arranged on the side of

the ground glass screen (4) facing away from the line
sensor (3).
Device according to one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the means for illuminating the test

material (F) include a direct-light illuminating means
(5) and a back-light illuminating means (6).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the means for illuminating the test material (F) are

formed by light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, flashlamps
or incandescent lamps.
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the output signal of the line sensor (3) is

passed via an amplifier (12) to a processing state (8),
in which two adjustable limit values, one for lighter

foreign substances and one for darker foreign substances,
are stored, and in that in the processing stage a

comparison of the said output signal with the respective
limit value is performed, the switching between the limit

values being carried out synchronously with the switching
of the light source (7) provided for the illumination of

the ground glass screen (4).
