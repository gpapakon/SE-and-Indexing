<ABSTRACT>
A steam cooking utensil (10) includes a base (12)
and a boiling liquid reservoir (16) defined by the base. A

heater (18) is mounted in the base (12) to heat liquid in
the boiling liquid reservoir (16). A cooking bowl (26) is

supported by the base (12) and includes a food support
surface (28) having a plurality of vent holes (42). An

adjustable and removable divider basket (46) is mounted in
the cooking bowl (26) and includes a food support surface

(54, 55) aligned with the food support surface (28) of the
cooking bowl. The food support surface (54, 55) of the

divider basket (46) includes a plurality of vent holes (56)
to allow steam formed in the boiling liquid reservoir to

enter into the divider basket. The divider basket comprises
first (46A) and second (46B) sections movably connected (47,

51) to each other to enable the user to adjust the effective
cooking area of the cooking bowl (26) and the divider basket

(46). The divider basket (46) includes handle means (34) to
enable the user to remove the basket (46) from the bowl

(26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steam cooking utensil 
and, in particular, to a divider basket for such a utensil 
5 which can be used to partition the cooking bowl thereof so 
that different foods may be steamed simultaneously. The use of steam cooking utensils has grown in 
popularity in recent years due to a general health 
consciousness of the population. Foods cooked in steamers 
tend to maintain their nutrients. United States Patent No.5,097,753 relates to a 
steam cooking utensil including a cooking bowl having a food 
support tray. In actual use, the steam cooking utensil 
disclosed can generally only be used to steam one type of 
food at any given time. It has been found that users of the 
steam cooking utensil sometimes desire simultaneously to 
steam more than one type of food. Additionally, there may 
be times when in steaming two types of food, one of the 
types of food should be steamed for a relatively short 
period of time and the other type of food should be steamed 
for a relatively long period of time. In such instances, it 
is desirable that the food that is steamed for a relatively 
short period of time should be easily and readily removable 
from the steam cooking utensil. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a steam cooking utensil having a removable and 
adjustable divider basket that can be mounted within the 
cooking bowl so that two foods of different types and/or 
sizes may be simultaneously steamed. The present invention therefore provides a steam 
cooking utensil comprises a base; a boiling liquid reservoir 
defined by the base; a heater mounted in the base to heat 
liquid contained in the boiling liquid reservoir and, a 
cooking bowl supported by the base and including a bottom 
tray defining a first food support surface, the food support  
 
surface including a plurality of vent holes to allow steam 
generated in the reservoir to flow into the cooking bowl, 
characterised in that an adjustable and removable divider 
basket mounted within the cooking bowl and supported thereby 
comprises a first section and a second section rotatably 
attached to the first section, the first section including a 
second food support surface overlying the first food support 
surface of the cooking bowl and the wall means extending 
vertically upward from the second food support surface, the 
wall means extending about a portion of the periphery of the 
second food support surface to provide an open end on the 
surface, the wall means forming a portion of the outer wall 
of the
