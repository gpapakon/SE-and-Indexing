<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of permitting the exchange of 
information between processes through a communication device. 
The present method allows the virtualization, starting from a 
communication device shared among several processes and capable 

of executing low level commands, of a communication device 
capable of executing high level commands and dedicated for each 

process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of permitting the
exchange of information between processes through a communication
device.Control devices are known, e.g., from patent applications EP-A
0 492 177 and EP-A 0 164 972, which, when connected to a storage
device, are capable of handling communication between processes
upon suitable configuration; these devices can be used in
connection with one or more processors. In particular, through
the device disclosed in the first of the two mentioned patent
applications, through the sending of suitable commands, a RAM
device can be configured as a set of independent memory blocks
each operating in accordance with a mode selected from FIFO,
LIFO, circular queue, etc.; through further commands, data can
be, e.g., introduced into and extracted from said memory blocks
without regard for their operation mode. Such devices, although
very effective in releasing the processors from handling the
communication between processes, nonetheless have the
disadvantage of being capable of carrying out low level commands
only, in general strictly related to their internal hardware
structure and certain characteristics of the special device
used.Such disadvantage has the practical implication of requiring a
widened knowledge of the devices by the programmer who develops 
software for hardware environments that include such devices; if such software
is for multiprocess real-time applications the possibility of making mistakes is
still higher since the concurrent access to such devices is to be taken into
account, too.Moreover, such software will be difficult to modify.It is an object of the present invention to overcome these advantages.
This object is achieved through the method of permitting the exchange of
information between processes through a communication device as set forth in
claim 1, and the processing system as set forth in claim 7.Further advantageous aspects of the present invention are set forth in the
subclaims.By virtualizing, through software, more precisely the system software
(advantageously realizable as firmware), a communication device capable of
carrying out high level commands realized directly in hardware, thus increasing
the speed of its execution with respect to a software implementation and
dedicated for each process, the above mentioned drawbacks are restricted to
the system software and therefore extremely reduced as to their harmful
effects.The present invention will become more apparent from the following description
taken in conjunction with the

<CLAIMS>
Method of permitting the exchange of information, through a
communication device (CD), between a first user process (P1) and a second

user process (P2), characterized in that it comprises the steps of:

a) activating a system linker process (LINKER) through a system software
capable of establishing a communication channel on said device (CD) between

said user processes (P1, P2) on receipt of a first primitive implemented directly in
hardware (CREATE-LINK), and
b) activating at least one system handler process (CD-HAND) through
said system software capable of transferring information, through said channel

established on said device (CD), from one of said user process to the other one
on receipt of a second send-message, primitive implemented directly in

hardware (SEND-MSG) and of a third wait-message, primitive implemented
directly in hardware (WAIT-MSG).
Method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of:

c) activating at least one system arbitrator process (RES-MAN) capable of
controlling the concurrent access to said device (CD) by said system

processes.
Method according to claim 1, wherein said step b) is capable of activating a
first and a second handler processes (CD-HAND), and wherein such transfer of

information occurs on receipt of said second primitive by said first handler
process and on receipt of said third primitive by said second handler process.
Method according to claim 1, wherein said high level primitives are sent by
said user processes.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that said handler process is
designed to receive low level primitives concerning initialization and test of said

device, readout and write of data from and into said device, transmit and
receive signallings to and from said device; and in that said low level primitives

in general cannot be sent by a user process.
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said
steps consist in sequences of machine language coded instructions stored in

storage means.
Processing system of the type including at least one user process (P1) and
a second user process (P2), characterized by comprising: 


a) a system linker process (LINKER) designed to establish a
communication channel on a communication device (CD) between said user

processes on receipt of a first high level primitive (CREATE-LINK), and
b) at least one system handler process (CD-HAND) capable of transferring
information through said communication device (CD) from one of said user

processes to the other one on receipt of a second send-message high level
primitive (SEND-MSG) and of a third wait-message high level primitive (WAIT-MSG);

in which all said processes are active.
Processing system according to claim 7, comprising a first and a second
handler processes (CD-HAND) capable of transferring information on receipt of

said second primitive by said first handler process and on receipt of said third
primitive by said handler process.
Processing system according to claim 7, further comprising:

c) a system arbitrator process (RES-MAN) designed to control the
concurrent access to said communication device (CD) by said system

processes;

wherein all said processes are active.
