<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pyrotechnic composition, 
a process for its manufacture, and a device incorporating 
it. It relates especially to a pyrotechnic composition 
for fireworks, and more especially to a rocket propellant 
composition. Conventional fireworks and display rockets are 
driven by a powder mixture of potassium nitrate, 
charcoal, and sulphur. Smaller rockets employ a mixture 
of potassium perchlorate and an alkali metal salt of an 
aromatic carboxylic acid. This mixture is conventionally 
modified by the addition of a liquid binder, for example 
a mineral or vegetable oil, which also reduces the 
sensitiveness of the composition to impact or friction. 
Other proposals have been that the composition should 
contain liquid components that react on mixing to form a 
solid polymeric binder - see, for example, British Patent 
Specification No. 1202390. In all such cases, however, 
the resulting composition is no longer free-flowing and 
so the rocket casing or other container may not be 
filled using the advantageous funnel and rammer technique 
employing a powder dispenser. A first aspect of the present invention provides a 
solid, flowable, elemental sulphur-free pyrotechnic 
composition which comprises at least three components, 
one of those components being an at least partially  
 
aromatic substance containing carbon and hydrogen in a 
ratio of at least 10:1 by weight, which component is 
substantially free of groups of the formulae COOH and 
COO⁻ M⁺, wherein M⁺ represents the equivalent of a metal 
ion, and acts as a binder. More especially, the invention provides a 
composition comprising 
(a) an at least partially aromatic organic substance, 
especially a compound, having a weight ratio of 
carbon:hydrogen of at least 10:1 and being 
substantially free of groups of the formulae COOH 
and COO⁻ M⁺, wherein M⁺ represents the equivalent 
of a metal ion, (b) an oxidizing agent and, optionally but preferably,  (c) an aromatic carboxylic acid or a salt or partial 
salt thereof.   Advantageously the compound (c) is a different 
chemical entity from that of component (a). A second aspect of the present invention provides a 
solid, flowable, elemental sulphur-free pyrotechnic 
composition which comprises at least three components, 
one of those components, component a, being an at least 
partially aromatic organic substance containing carbon 
and hydrogen in a ratio of at least 10:1 by weight, which 
component acts as a binder, and another of those 
components, component b, being an
