<ABSTRACT>
Pressure-sensitive copying material utilises a blend of rapid- and 
slow-developing chromogenic materials in vegetable oil 

solvent and an acid clay or synthetic inorganic colour 
developer. The surface pH of the colour developer is not more 

than 8.7, which gives rise to enhanced image intensity and fade 
resistance compared with the use of conventional higher colour 

developer surface pH values.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pressure-sensitive copying material, 
particularly carbonless copying paper. Pressure-sensitive copying material is well-known and is widely 
used in the production of business forms sets. Various types 
of pressure-sensitive copying material are known, of which the 
most widely used is the transfer type. A business forms set 
using the transfer type of pressure-sensitive copying material 
comprises an upper sheet (usually known as a "CB" sheet) coated 
on its lower surface with microcapsules containing a solution 
in an oil solvent or solvent composition of at least one 
chromogenic material (alternatively termed a colour former) and 
a lower sheet (usually known as a "CF" sheet) coated on its 
upper surface with a colour developer composition. If more 
than one copy is required, one or more intermediate sheets 
(usually known as "CFB" sheets) are provided, each of which is 
coated on its lower surface with microcapsules and on its upper 
surface with colour developer composition. Imaging pressure 
exerted on the sheets by writing, typing or impact printing 
(e.g. dot matrix or daisy-wheel printing) ruptures the 
microcapsules, thereby releasing or transferring chromogenic 
material solution on to the colour developer composition and 
giving rise to a chemical reaction which develops the colour 
of the chromogenic material and so produces a copy image. In a variant of the above-described arrangement, the solution 
of chromogenic material may be present as isolated droplets in 
a continuous pressure-rupturable matrix instead of being 
contained within discrete pressure-rupturable microcapsules. In another type of pressure-sensitive copying system, usually 
known as a self-contained or autogenous system, microcapsules 
and colour developing co-reactant material are coated onto the  
 
same surface of a sheet, and writing or typing on a sheet 
placed above the thus-coated sheet causes the microcapsules to 
rupture and release the solution of chromogenic material, which 
then reacts with the colour developing material on the sheet 
to produce a coloured image. The solvents used to dissolve the chromogenic materials in 
pressure-sensitive copying materials as described above have 
typically been hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum or 
coal deposits, for example partially hydrogenated terphenyls, 
alkyl naphthalenes, diarylmethane derivatives, or dibenzyl 
benzene derivatives or derivatives of hydrocarbon products, for 
example chlorinated paraffins. These "prime solvents"

<CLAIMS>
Pressure-sensitive copying material comprising a sheet 
support carrying isolated droplets of an oil solution of 

chromogenic materials, said droplets being confined 
within respective pressure-rupturable barriers, and, on 

the opposite surface of the same sheet or on a different 

sheet support, a coating of an inorganic colour developer 
material effective to develop the colour of the 

chromogenic materials in said solution on contact 
therewith, at least one of said chromogenic materials 

having the characteristic of developing colour 
immediately on contact with the colour developer, 

wherein 

a) the solvent for the chromogenic material consists 
essentially of vegetable oil and, optionally, a 

fatty acid ester or other mono-or di-functional 
ester of a non-aromatic mono-carboxylic acid having 

a saturated or unsaturated straight or branched 
hydrocarbon chain with at least three carbon atoms 

in the chain; 
b) the surface pH of the colour developer coating is 
not more than 8.7; and 
c) the solution of chromogenic materials includes at 
least one chromogenic material which is relatively 

slower in developing colour on contact with the 
colour developer than the above-mentioned 

immediately-developing chromogenic material(s) but 
which is not of the formula (II) below:
