<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyolefin composition, and
more specifically, to a propylene polymer composition having
incorporated therein a high melt strength propylene polymer
material.Polypropylene resins have been widely used in various
fields, such as fibers, films and other shaped articles,
because of their excellent physical and mechanical properties.
However, polypropylene has high crystallinity and poor
affinity for dye or pigments.Attempts have been made to improve the dye receptivity of
polypropylene resin. For example, U.S. 3,415,904 discloses
incorporating into polypropylene an ethylene/acrylic ester
copolymer which has been treated with an amine. U.S.
4,872,880 discloses treating a polyolefin article with an
aqueous dye bath, wherein the polyolefin is a blend of a
polyolefin and a copolymer selected from (a) a zinc ionomer of
a copolymer of an alpha-olefin and (b) a graft copolymer of at
least one alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid or
unsaturated carboxylic acid anhydride grafted onto a
polyolefin backbone.It is known and discussed in the paper of Y. Lin, et.
al., entitled, "The Effect of Pigments on the Development of
Structure and Properties of Polypropylene Filaments", ANTEC
'91, page 1950-1953, that many compounds act as nucleating
agents for the crystallization of polypropylene and different
pigments nucleate crystallization in polypropylene during the
fiber forming process, blue pigments being highly active as a
nucleating agent and white pigments being substantially less
active. Thus, in view of the varying degree of nucleating
activity of different pigments, when processing fibers/yarns
of propylene polymer resins having color, adjustments
typically must be made in processing conditions, spinning
speeds and draw ratios, in order to produce colored
fibers/yarns with consistent and desirable properties
depending upon the particular color used. These changes in
processing conditions generally result in lost production time
as well as production of yarns that do not meet target
specifications.Accordingly, there is provided a propylene polymer composition consisting
essentially of (A) a proyplene polymer resin having a melt flow rate of 5 to 50
dg/min selected from the group consisting of (i) a propylene homopolymer having
an isotactic index greater than 80, and (ii) a random copolymer of propylene and
olefin selected from ethylene or C4-10 alpha-olefins, provided that when the olefin
is ethylene the maximum polymerized ethylene content is 10%, and when the
olefin is a C4-10
