<ABSTRACT>
Cooling of metal strip (16) in a single or multistand cold rolling line by applying coolant liquid only to the lower surface of the strip (16), and removing the liquid therefrom, after each, or between successive roll stands (11a, 11b, 11c). The liquid is delivered, at each cooling locality, at low pressure through a plurality of slots (32) each extending transversely beneath and across the full width of the strip (16), the slots (32) being spaced apart along the path of the strip (16) and generally being oriented to discharge the coolant liquid toward the strip lower surface at an angle of greater than 90 DEG  to the direction of strip advance. Coolant removal is effected by directing one or more liquid knives (52a, 54a, 60a) against the strip lower surface between the plurality of slots (32) and the next downstream roll stand in the line, at a location at which the strip (16) is trained around a hold-down roll (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for applying liquid coolant
to, and removing the coolant from, metal strip advancing in a
continuous line, as known from US-A-3192752 (closest prior art).In the cold rolling of sheet metal such as aluminum
strip (the term "aluminum" being used herein to refer to
aluminum-based alloys as well as pure aluminum metal), the
strip is reduced in thickness by cold working in one or a
tandem succession of roll stands each typically including
upper and lower work rolls (between which the strip
passes) and upper and lower backup rolls respectively
above and below (and in contact with) the upper and lower
work rolls. The strip to be reduced is paid out from a
coil at the upstream end of the cold rolling line, and
after passage through the roll stand or stands, is rewound
into a coil at the downstream end of the line, the
cold-rolling operation being essentially continuous.Unavoidably, the cold working of the strip as it
passes through the nip of each roll stand is accompanied
by some elevation of strip temperature. In a single-stand
mill, this temperature rise is usually not troublesome
provided the strip enters the mill near room temperature.
In a multistand tandem mill, however, the increases in 
strip temperature at the several roll stands are
cumulative, with the result that the exit temperature of
the strip from the mill may exceed acceptable limits, even
with entry at room temperature. For example, computer
model analysis of a three-stand mill indicates that the
strip exit temperature can approach a value as high as
300°C, depending primarily on the particular alloy being
rolled, the extent of the reductions to which it is
subjected in the mill, and the rolling conditions. On the
other hand, considerations related to process reliability,
such as the avoidance of strip breaks, and metallurgical
and mechanical considerations related to product
performance, require that the exit or coiling temperature
of cold-rolled aluminum strip be kept usually between 100
and 180°C, depending on the product, a typical limiting
value being around 150°C. Moreover, in the case of some
products, it would be highly advantageous to control the
coiling temperature of cold-rolled strip within some
predetermined range for maximum efficiency and benefit in
subsequent process steps. At the time this invention was
made, it was not possible to realize this control because
usually the roll stands were flooded with coolant, so that
the exit temperature depended on the history of the coil,
and the rolling

<CLAIMS>
A cold rolling procedure which comprises
continuously advancing an aluminum or aluminum alloy strip

(16) longitudinally along a generally horizontal path
through a roll
ing mill with opposed major surfaces of the
strip (16) respectively facing upwardly and downwardly,

and cooling the strip from an initial temperature of up to
300°C characterized by delivering coolant liquid (44) into contact with

the downwardly facing surface of the advancing strip (16) only;
discharging the coolant liquid (44) upwardly, onto

the downwardly facing strip surface through slots (32)
disposed below the strip (16) and extending across

substantially the entire width of the strip (16) while
preventing the discharged coolant liquid from coming into

contact with the upwardly facing surface of the strip;
advancing the strip (16) at a

velocity of at least 225 m/min through at least one roll
stand (11) for reducing the thickness of the strip by cold

rolling and discharging said coolant liquid (44) upwardly
onto the downwardly facing strip surface in the form of

transverse water curtains, at a pressure sufficient to
contact the strip surface without substantial upward

deflection of the strip, through a plurality of said upwardly
opening slots (32) disposed below the strip (16) in spaced

relation thereto and spaced apart along the path, at a
location downstream of at least one roll stand of a

multistand cold-rolling line (11a, b, c) or between a coil
pay-off stand (18) and a roll stand (11a) of a cold-rolling

line, and further characterized by downstream from
said plurality of slots (32) removing coolant liquid from

the downwardly facing strip surface.

that the coolant liquid (44) is water.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in
that all the slots (32) are oriented to direct the coolant

liquid (44) toward the strip (16) at an angle of at least
90° to the direction of advance of the strip in the path. 
A process according to claim 3, characterized in that
most of the slots (32) are oriented to direct the coolant

liquid (44) toward the strip (16) at an angle greater than 90°
to the direction of advance of the strip in the path.
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that
one or more of the slots (32) which are furthest upstream with

respect to the strip path is oriented to direct the coolant
liquid (44) toward the strip (16) at an angle of about 90° to

the direction of strip advance, for limiting the upstream
extent of coolant delivery.
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that
the coolant liquid (44) is supplied to the slots (32) at a

pressure such that it impinges on the strip (16) from each
slot (32) as a continuous curtain of water across

substantially the full width of the strip (16) without
substantially upwardly deflecting the strip.
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that
the slots (32) are each between 0.2 and 5.0 mm wide.
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that
the spacing between adjacent slots (32), in the direction

of strip advance, is between 50 and 500 mm.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that
the coolant liquid is removed from the downwardly facing strip

surface by directing a liquid knife (52) against the
downwardly facing strip surface at an angle greater than 90°

to the direction of strip advance.
A process according to claim 9, characterized in
that said liquid knife (52) is a knife of a liquid different

from and immiscible with said coolant liquid.
A process according to claim 9, characterized in

A process according to claim 12, characterized in
that the coolant liquid (44) is water and the second-knife

(54) liquid is oil.
A process according to claim 9, characterized in
that the removing step further includes training the strip

(16) around a hold-down roll (56) in contact with the upwardly
facing strip surface at a location such that the liquid knife

(52) impinges against the downwardly facing strip surface at a
point at which the upwardly facing strip surface engages said

hold-down roll (56).
A process according to claim 1, characterized in
that said procedure is a multistand cold rolling procedure

in which the strip (16) is advanced continuously
longitudinally through at least two roll stands (11a, 11b) in

succession for progressively reducing the thickness of the
