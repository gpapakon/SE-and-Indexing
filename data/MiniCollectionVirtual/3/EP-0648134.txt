<ABSTRACT>
An injection device is provided for an infinitely variable metering and administering of a liquid preparation and comprising a holder device for a multi-dose injection cartridge, the rear piston of which may be moved forward by means of a piston rod. The piston rod is provided with releasable locking means comprising at least one longitudinal groove having a wedge-shaped cross section and at least one locking lug having a cross section adapted to that of the groove, and means for urging the locking lug or lugs into said groove or grooves to lock the movement of the piston rod, or to release the locking lug or lugs from said groove or grooves to free the movement of said piston rod. At its rear end, the piston rod is connected to a spring device for moving the piston rod forward and to a device for determining the stroke of the piston rod when the preparation is administered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a device for
dozing and administering a liquid preparation. More
specifically, the invention refers to repeated dosing
and administering of liquid pharmaceutic preparations
by parenteral injection from a multi-dose container.
Still more specifically, the invention refers to a
device for infinitely variable dozing and administering
of liquid pharmaceutic preparation by parenteral
injection from a multi-dose container, such as an
injection cartridge.In the international patent application WO 93/08854
is described a method for repeated dosing of a liquid
preparation of a pharmaceutically active agent by administration
from a multi-dose container having a defined
volume. What characterizes this method is that
the amount of the preparation to be dosed is selected
to be 1/N of the volume of the multi-dose container, N
being an integer having a value of 2 or higher. The
value of N is selected and set before the repeated
dosing of the preparation from the multi-dose container
is started, and is maintained unchanged through a
series of N successive administrations from the multi-dose
container, which has consequently then been
emptied. As the other variable is used the concentration
of the liquid preparation, such that the portion
1/N will give the desired dose of the pharmaceutically
active agent. By using a series of containers with
preparations of different concentrations, and a
plurality of values for N, it is clear that a great
number of different doses of the active agent can be
obtained.Through the method and system described, it has thus
become possible to administer a number of doses of a 
liquid preparation from a multi-dose container in such
a way that essentially no residue of the preparation is
obtained. This is of considerable importance when very
expensive pharmaceutical agents are to be administered,
such as growth hormones.The above-mentioned international application
WO 93/08854 also discloses a device for the repeated
dosing of a liquid preparation from a multi-dose container.
Such a device comprises a holder device for a
multi-dose container having a defined volume and containing
a preparation having a defined composition, and
the multi-dose container is provided with a fixed front
wall, through which may be arranged an outlet for the
preparation, and a movable rear wall, which may act as
a piston for expelling the preparation through said
outlet, and a piston rod, by which the rear movable
wall may be urged forwards. What characterizes the
device is that
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An injection device for infinitely variable
metering and administering of a liquid injectable preparation,

comprising a holder device (1,2,3) for a
multi-dose injection cartridge (6) which comprises a

front fixed wall through which may be arranged a liquid
connection for discharging the preparation, a piston rod (12) and

a rear movable wall (11) which may be moved forward by means
of the piston rod (12) to expel the preparation from said

cartridge, the piston rod (12) at its rear end being
connected to a spring device (32) for moving said

piston rod (12) forward at the administering, and a
device (28) for setting the stroke of the piston rod

(12) when the preparation is administered,
characterized in that the piston rod (12) is provided

with releasable locking means consisting of at least
one longitudinal groove (13) having a wedge-shaped

cross-section and at least one locking lug (14) having
a cross-section adapted to that of the groove (13), and

means for urging said locking lug or lugs (14) into
said groove or grooves (13) to lock the longitudinal

movement of said piston rod (12), and to release said
locking lug or lugs (14) from said groove or grooves

(13) to free said piston rod (12).
An injection device according to claim 1, characterized
in that said locking means consist of at least

two longitudinal grooves (13) which are evenly spaced
around the circumference of said piston rod (12), and a

corresponding number of locking lugs(14), said locking
lugs (14) having a conical shape around their outer

peripheral parts (16) with the smaller diameter at the
rear and being surrounded by a tubular sleeve (17)

which rests against the outer conical parts (16) of
said locking lugs (14) and which can be moved in the 

longitudinal direction such that it exerts a force in
the radial direction on said locking lugs (14) to urge

them into said grooves (13) to lock the movement of the
piston rod (12), or release the force on said locking

lugs (14) to free the movement of said piston rod (12).
An injection device according to claim 2, characterized
in that said tubular sleeve (17) is urged

against said locking lugs (14) by means of a spring
pressure (19) in the longitudinal direction on said

sleeve to urge said locking lugs (14) into said
grooves, and that said tubular sleeve (17) by means of

a lever device (22) may be displaced in the
longitudinal direction against said spring pressure

(19), to release the pressure on said locking lugs (14)
to free the movement of the piston rod (12).
An injection device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the piston rod (12) at its rear

end is connected to a threaded coaxial sleeve (27)
which is in engagement with a threaded screw (28) which

at its rear end is provided with a stopping device (29)
which after the administering rests against the rear

end of said holder device (1,2,3), the stroke of said
piston rod (12) being determined by the distance which

said screw (28) has been advanced into said threaded
sleeve (27).
An injection device according to claim 4, characterized
in that the holder device (1,2,3) for the

injection cartridge (6) is provided at its rear end
with an internal forward-facing sleeve (31) wherein the

threaded sleeve (27) arranged at the rear end of said
piston rod (12) is slidably arranged, and that said

sleeve (27) at the rear end of said piston rod (12) is
provided with a flange (26) which by abutting the front

end of said internal forward-facing (31) sleeve 
restricts the forward travel of said internal sleeve

(31), and by this also the forward stroke of the piston
rod (12) at the administering.
An injection device according to any of claim 5,
characterized in that said holder device (1,2,3)

comprises a front outer sleeve (2), which surrounds the
injection cartridge and the locking means for the

piston rod (12), and a rear outer sleeve (1), which
surrounds the spring device (32) for moving the piston

rod (12) forward at the administering and the device
(31) for determining the stroke of said piston rod

(12), said front outer sleeve (2) being arranged to be
screwed into said rear outer sleeve (1) such that the

injection device by this movement is readied for injection
by moving the rear inte
rnal forward-facing sleeve
(31) forwards against the pressure of said spring (31)

until the flange (26) on the sleeve (31) at the rear
end of the piston rod (12) abuts the front end of said

internal forward-facing sleeve (31).
