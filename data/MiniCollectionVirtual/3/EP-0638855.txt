<ABSTRACT>
A thermal fusing device for fusing toner images on the front sides of an image carrier (17) in an electrographic printer or copying machine, in which the rear side of the image carrier (17) may already have a fused toner image, contains a thermal printing/fusing station (12, 11) which fuses the toner images on the image carrier (17) and, connected upstream of the thermal printing/fusing station (11, 12) in the direction in which the image carrier runs, a pre-heating saddle (heating saddle) (15) with an assigned sliding surface (30) which accommodates (takes up) the image carrier (17) via its rear side. The sliding surface (30) is constructed, at least in the contact region with the image carrier (17), from a toner-repellent (toner-rejecting) material (30) (PTFE or PFA).

Thermal fixing system for fixing toner images on 
the front side of a recording medium (17) in an electrographic 

printer or copier device, in which the rear side 
of the recording medium (17) may already exhibit a fixed 

toner image, having
 
a heat transfer fixing station (12, 11) fixing the toner 

images on the recording medium (17), and
 
a preheating saddle (15), preceding the heat transfer 

fixing station (11, 12) in the direction of travel of the 
recording medium, having an associated sliding surface 

(24) receiving the recording medium (17) via its rear-side, 
the sliding surface (24) being constructed, at 

least in the region of contact with the recording medium 
(17), from a toner-repellent material (30). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 1, 
having a toner-repellent material (30) comprising a 

fluorine compound. 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 2, 
having a PTFE or PFA compound as toner-repellent material 

(30). 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, having a toner-repellent material (30) exhibiting 

wear-reducing particles such as graphite and/or glass 
fibres. 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, having a toner-repellent material (30) which is 

designed to be electrostatically conductive. 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, having a sliding surface (24) which is exchangeably 

securable on the preheating saddle (15).  
 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, having a film as sliding surface (24), which 

exhibits, for securing on the preheating saddle (15), a 
thermally conductive adhesive layer which is as thin as 

possible. 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, having a film (33) as sliding surface (24), which 

is guided, proceeding from a supply region (34), via the 
preheating saddle (15) to a delivery region (35). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 8, 
having a drive device moving the film (33) over the 

preheating saddle (15). 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 9, having a device which, if required, separates the 

recording medium (17) from the preheating saddle (15). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 10, 
having a pneumatic device which, via air exit openings 

associated with the preheating saddle (15), generates an 
air cushion separating the recording medium (17) from the 

preheating saddle (15). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 10, 
having a lift-off element (38) engaging behind the 

recording medium (17) over its width in the region of the 
preheating saddle (15), the preheating saddle (15) and 

the lift-off element (38) being designed to be movable 
relative to one another in such a manner that in a lift-off 

condition the recording medium (17) is guided via the 
lift-off element (38) at a spacing from the preheating 

saddle (15). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 12, 
having a cable-type element (38) as lift-off element. 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 13, having a preheating saddle (15) which exhibits, 

at an end (36) facing the heat transfer fixing station, 
at least one smoothing roller (37), over which the 

recording medium (17) is deflected from a direction of 
travel determined by the sliding surface (24) into an 

admission direction to the heat transfer fixing station  
 

(11, 12), the angle of deflection being dimensioned in 
such a manner that a smoothing effect is exerted on the 

recording medium (17). 
Thermal fixing system according to Claim 14, 
having a smoothing roller (37) exhibiting a toner-repellent 

layer (30). 
Thermal fixing system according to one of Claims 
1 to 15, having a preheating saddle (15) having a first 

heating zone of low temperature, which first heating zone 
is designed as a pre-heat-applying saddle (21), and a 

second heating zone of higher temperature, which second 
heating zone is located downstream in the direction of 

travel of the recording medium and is designed as a heat-applying 
saddle (23). 
Process for producing a sliding surface (24) 
according to one of Claims 1 to 6 by applying a toner-repellent 

material layer (30) to a carrier surface 
associated with the preheating saddle (15).
