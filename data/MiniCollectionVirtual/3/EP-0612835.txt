<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a refrigerating machine oil 
composition which comprises a base oil such as polyglycol, 

polyvinyl ether or the like which base oil is blended with an 
epoxy compound represented by the general formula (I) 


wherein R¹ and R² are as defined in the text of the present 
specification or with at least one epoxy compound selected 

from the group consisting of D-limonene oxide, L-limonene 
oxide, α-pinene oxide and L-carvone oxide. The composition 

is excellent in stability, sludge preventive properties, 
copper-plating preventive properties, etc. and is 

particularly effective for use in an automobile air 
conditioner, a room air conditioner, a refrigerator, etc., 

thereby making itself extremely valuable from the viewpoint 
of industrial utilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating
machine oil composition. More particularly, it pertains to a
refrigerating machine oil composition which is excellent in
stability, sludge preventive properties and copper-plating
preventive properties.There have heretofore been employed a variety of
refrigerating machine oils as the lubricating oils for
various refrigerating machines to be used in automobile air
conditioners, refrigerators, room air conditioners and the
like. Since such refrigerating machine oils are in use for a
long period of time, they are required to be highly reliable.However, such various disadvantages are pointed out in
the conventional refrigerating machine oils as the generation
of copper plating, unsatisfactory stability, rise in total
acid number and sludge formation. In view of the above,
there are proposed and used the compositions comprising
various base oils in various combination with additives.Nevertheless, it can not be said that any of the above-proposed
compositions now in use is satisfactory from the
viewpoint of practical application. In particular,
importance has been attached to environmental problems in
recent years with the result that the use of a specified flon
refrigerant was sustained which threatens destruction of the 
ozone layer. Herein, flon means fluorochlorocarbon,
fluorochlorohydrocarbon, fluorohydrocarbon or fluorocarbon.
Consequently, some alternative refrigerants have emerged, and
thus it is hoped that a refrigerating machine oil well suited
to such refrigerants will be developed as early as possible.The research and development of such refrigerating
machine oil, however, are only in the very beginning,
revealing the actual situation that the achievement therefrom
is not yet sufficient.US-4,431,557 discloses a fluid composition comprised of a fluorocarbon refrigerant, a
hydrocarbon oil and an alkylene oxide additive compound. The additive is said to improve
the thermal resistance of the oil in the presence of the refrigerant.DE-A-2820640 discloses a highly viscous oil composition for refrigerating machines
comprising a polyglycol oil having a kinematic viscosity of 50 - 200 cSt at 98,9° C and a
viscosity index of at least 150 and 0,1 - 10 % by weight of at least one compound from
the group comprising epoxy compounds of either the glycidylether, epoxydized fatty acid
monoester and epoxydized vegetable oil type.US-2,552,084 discloses a fluid for use in refrigerating systems comprising a halogenated
hydrocarbon refrigerant and lubricant either with or
