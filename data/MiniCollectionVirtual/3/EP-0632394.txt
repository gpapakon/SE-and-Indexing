<ABSTRACT>
To provide a tape printer capable of simply printing 
character strings of inputted text in a variety of text row 

shapes, when a character string ABCD is developed into a dot 
pattern data according to a pattern number 1, first the lower 

edge of the character pattern for character A is aligned with 
the alignment standard position KP1 (baseline) and arranged 

in the print buffer. Then the character sizes of the 
characters B, C, and D are each increased compared to a 

respective previous character by the size change amount 
calculated in the size change amount calculation process 

control. With each increase, the lower edges of the character 

pattern is aligned with the alignment standard position 
KP1 and the resultant character patterns are arranged in 

order in the print buffer. The character string is printed 
in a character string shape based on the dot pattern data 

developed in the print buffer so that character sizes of 
characters in the character string ABCD gradually increase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a text processing
device, and more particularly to a text processing device for
printing character strings of inputted text in various
character string shapes such as diamond or trapezoidal
shapes.Conventionally, a text processing device such as a
word processor for various languages basically includes a
display for displaying several rows of text data, a keyboard,
a printing device, and the like. The conventional text
processing device prints text data for inputted text,
symbols, and the like at a designated character size, space
value, and character pitch on a print sheet with each row
arranged to a standard position.Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. HEI-1-85050,
which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1,
discloses a tape printer with a text processing
function. The tape printer can print inputted text data on
tapes (for example, with widths of 10 or 24 mm) as a print
medium at designated character sizes, character pitches, and
the like. Various enhancements or functions are added to
this tape printer, including a function allowing changing the
size of only specified characters or character strings of
text data.A user may want to print character strings, made from
inputted characters, symbols and the like, in character
string shapes, such as diamond or trapezoid shapes, made by
gradually increasing or decreasing the size of characters in
a string of characters.To print a character string in a simple shape, such
as a trapezoidal or parallellpiped shape where only the side
portions are slanted, the size of characters in the character
string can be gradually decreased or increased using the size
change function. However, the size change data must be
inputted every time a character or symbol is inputted so that 
data input becomes troublesome. Additionally, the sizes of
individual characters are changed in rough amounts so that
the overall character string can not be printed with a good
shape.Further, character strings cannot be printed with the
baseline of character string being moved down to have rotated
parallelepiped or trapezoidal shapes which have a slanted
lower edge. It is an object of the present invention to provide a text
processing device and a tape printer for printing a character
string on an elongated web-like medium, which are capable of
simply printing character strings of inputted text in a variety
of outline contour shapes.This object is solved by a text processing device with the
features of claim 1.Preferred developments of the
