optically active 1,2-diol derivative by optical resolution. 

The optically active 1,2-diol derivative of the formula 
(I) which is capable of utilizing as an intermediate of 

fungicidal optically-active azole derivatives can be 
produced by esterifying a 1,2-diol derivative of the 

formula (I) as a substrate with a carboxylic acid 
derivative of the formula (II) as a reagent in the presence 

of a lipase as a catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
production of optically active compounds, which are capable 
of utilizing as intermediates of fungicidal optically-active 
azole derivatives, by optical resolution by means of 
a lipase. EP257375 and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 28, 462 - 463 
(1989) disclose a process for asymmetric synthesis of 
(S)-2-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butanediol 
which is an intermediate of (S)-α-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol having a higher fungicidal activity in 
enantiomers of optical isomers. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 53886/1991 
discloses optical resolution of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol by 
means of a lipase. The 1,2-diol used as a substrate for optical 
resolution by means of a lipase, which is described in the 
above-mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 
53886/1991, has a hydroxyl group attached to a primary  
 
carbon atom and a hydroxyl group attached to a secondary 
carbon atom. On the other hand, (S)-2-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-3,3-dimethyl-1,2-butanediol 
described in the above-mentioned 
EP257375 and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 28, 462 - 
463 (1989) has a hydroxyl group attached to a primary 
carbon atom and a hydroxyl group attached to a tertiary 
carbon atom. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
process for producing optically active 1,2-diol derivatives 
of the following formula (I) by optical resolution of 1,2-diol 
derivatives represented by the formula (I) which have 
a hydroxyl group attached to a primary carbon atom and a 
hydroxyl group attached to a tertiary carbon atom, as a 
substrate, which comprises utilizing an esterification 
reaction in the presence of a lipase as a catalyst. 
wherein R¹ is C1 - C5 alkyl group, C3 - C7 cycloalkyl group 
or C1 - C5 haloalkyl group, R² is C1 - C3 alkyl group 
substituted by a phenyl group which may have one or two 
halogen atoms and/or C1 - C4 alkyl groups, C2 - C3 alkenyl 
group substituted by a phenyl group which may have one or  
 
two halogen atoms and/or C1 - C4 alkyl groups, or C1 - C3 
alkyl group substituted by a phenoxy group which may have 
one or two halogen atoms and/or C1 - C4 alkyl groups. As a result of earnest studies, the present 
inventors have found that an optically active 1,2-diol 
derivative of the formula (I) can be obtained by 
esterifying a 1,2-diol derivative of the above-mentioned 
formula (I) as the substrate with a carboxylic acid 
derivative of the following formula (II) as a reagent
