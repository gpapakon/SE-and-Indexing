<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for thermal
transfer recording of a multicolor image and a heat sensitive
ink sheet favorably employable for the recording
method. In more detail, the invention relates to a thermal
transfer recording method for forming a multicolor
image on an image receiving sheet by means of a thermal
head printer.Heretofore, there have been known two thermal transfer
recording methods for the preparation of a multicolor
image which utilize a thermal head printer, that is, a
sublimation dye transfer recording method and a fused ink
transfer recording method.The sublimation dye transfer method comprises the
steps of superposing on an image receiving sheet a transfer
sheet which is composed of a support and a transfer
layer comprising a sublimation ink and a binder and
imagewise heating the support of the transfer sheet to
sublimate the sublimation ink to form an image on the
image receiving sheet. A multicolor image can be prepared
using a number of color transfer sheets such as a
yellow transfer sheet, a magenta transfer sheet, and a
cyan transfer sheet.The sublimation dye transfer recording method, however,
has the following drawbacks:
1) The gradation of image is mainly formed of
variation of the sublimated dye concentration, which is
varied by controlling the amount of sublimation of the 
dye. Such gradation is appropriate for the preparation
of a photographic image, but is inappropriate for the
preparation of a color proof which is utilized in the
field of printing and whose gradation is formed of dots,
lines, or the like, that is, area gradation.2) The image formed of sublimated dye has poor
edge sharpness, and a fine line shows thinner density on
its solid portion than a thick line. Such tendency causes
serious problem in the quality of character image.3) The image of sublimated dye is poor in endurance.
Such image cannot be used in the fields which
require multicolor images resistant to heat and light.4) The sublimation dye transfer recording method
shows sensitivity lower than the fused ink transfer recording
method. Such low sensitive recording method is
not preferably employable in a high speed recording method
utilizing a high resolution thermal head, of which
development is expected in the future.5) The recording material for the sublimation dye
transfer recording method is expensive, as compared with
the recording material for the fused ink transfer recording
method.The fused ink transfer recording method comprises
the steps of superposing on an image receiving sheet a

A method for thermal transfer recording of a
multicolor image by area gradation which comprises the

steps of:

superposing a first heat sensitive ink sheet on an
image receiving sheet, said first heat sensitive ink

sheet having a support sheet and an essentially transparent
heat sensitive ink layer having a thickness of 0.2 to

1.0 µm which is formed of a heat sensitive ink material
comprising 30 to 70 weight parts of a colored pigment at

least 70 weight % of which has a particle size of not
more than 1.0 µm and 25 to 60 weight parts of amorphous

organic polymer having a softening point of 40 to 150°C;
placing a thermal head on the support of
the first heat sensitive ink sheet to imagewise form and transfer a

color image of the heat sensitive ink material onto the
image receiving sheet;
separating the support of the ink sheet from the
image receiving sheet so that the color image of the heat

sensitive ink material is retained on the image receiving

to 60 weight parts of amorphous organic polymer having a
softening point of 40 to 150°C;
placing a thermal head on the support of
the second heat sensitive ink sheet to imagewise form and transfer

a color image of the heat sensitive ink material onto the
