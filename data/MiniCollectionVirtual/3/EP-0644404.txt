<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for discriminating true echoes from false echoes 
in an ultrasonic liquid gauging system is disclosed. 

Electrical representations of an echo sequence received 
after an ultrasonic transmission are produced by a 

transducer (T). Such echo sequence contains one or more 
returned echoes that may be a true or false echo. A 

microprocessor (20) determines the returned echo energy 
for the echoes in the echo sequence. The system uses echo 

energy as a factor to distinguish a true echo from a false 
echo.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to liquid gauging systems 
of the type that use ultrasonic echo ranging to determine 
liquid levels. More particularly, the invention relates to 
methods and apparatus for discriminating true and false echoes 
to improve accuracy of such systems. It is well known to use ultrasonic echo ranging to 
determine liquid levels. Common applications include fuel 
gauging systems in fuel tanks. Typically, one or more 
ultrasonic transducers are disposed near the bottom of a 
liquid tank or container. The transducers emit ultrasonic 
pulses on the order of 1 megahertz frequency towards the 
liquid surface. Each ultrasonic pulse is reflected at the 
fuel/air interface and returns in the form of an echo pulse. 
The echo pulses are then detected by the same transducer that 
transmitted the pulse or are detected by a different sensor. 
The detection sensor typically produces an electrical output 
signal that corresponds to receipt of the echo. Thus, the 
round trip time from pulse emission to echo detection 
corresponds to the distance of the liquid surface from the 
sensors. Characterization data of the fuel tank can thus be 
used with the level detection data to determine liquid 
quantity in the tank. Ultrasonic liquid level detection in fuel tanks such as 
are used on aircraft is complicated by several factors. 
First, water tends to accumulate in the bottom of the fuel 
tanks, particularly on aircraft that fly at higher altitudes 
over extended distances, such as, for example, transoceanic 
commercial flights. Water at the bottom of the tank can 
present a fuel/water interface that reflects ultrasonic energy 
in the form of false echoes back to the transducers when such 
transducers are disposed at or near the tank bottom. Such 
false echoes can be mistaken for true fuel level echoes and 
thus give a false indication of fuel level and quantity.  Another problem that arises in fuel tanks is the presence 
of air bubbles. Aircraft manufacturers have run tests that 
indicate the presence of air bubbles, under some conditions 
large in size and quantity, due to fuel slosh and vibration 
under various flight scenarios. Air bubbles present a 
fuel/air interface that can reflect ultrasonic energy in the 
form of false echoes. These echoes can also be misinterpreted 
as false liquid level readings. Accordingly, the objective exists for apparatus and 
methods for discriminating true and false echoes in ultrasonic 
liquid level sensing systems. Such apparatus and methods 
should be capable of
