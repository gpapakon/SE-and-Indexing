<ABSTRACT>
A device (19) for wiping motor vehicle windscreens has a wiper blade (14) that swings over the windscreen (19) and is pressed against the latter by a bearing force. The wiping element (15) of the wiper blade (14) tips into a dragging position at every change of direction. In order to ensure a brisk and noiseless shift of the wiping element (15) from its first to its second operating position, the bearing force in the area of both positions (52, 54) of reversal of the swinging motion is lower than in the section (17) of the wiping field located between these areas.

Wiping device (10) for windows (19) of motor 
vehicles, with a wiping blade (14) which is moved in an 

oscillating manner over the window, is applied to the 
latter with a contact force and the wiping element (15) 

of which tips into a drag position on each change of 
direction and the contact force is smaller in the region 

of the two oscillation reversal positions (52, 54) than 
in the wiping field section lying between these regions, 

the wiping device (10) having a wiper shaft (20) which is 
driven in an oscillating manner and on one end of which 

the wiping lever (12) is fastened, which is located on 
the wiper shaft with a hub part (18), on which a wiper 

arm (16) which bears the wiping blade (14) is articulated, 
and the joint axis (13), which lies in the oscillation 

plane, extends between hub part (18) and wiper arm 
(16) essentially in the oscillation direction, on the hub 

part (18) a pretensioned tension spring (72) engages, 
which brings about the contact force of the wiping blade 

(14), the other end of which is anchored on the wiper arm 
(16), a two-armed lever (64) being mounted oscillatably 

on the hub part (18), on one lever arm (70) of which one 
end of the tension spring (72) is held and the other 

lever arm (68) of which interacts with a longitudinally 
displaceable tappet (62) in such a manner that the tappet 

(62), which is moved by control means in relation to the 
other lever arm (68), pivots the lever (64) and at the 

same time increases the spring tension, characterised in 
that the control means are formed by a cam track (80) 

which is displaceable in the direction of the tappet axis 
and at least partially surrounds an extension of the  

 
oscillation axis (66) and by pick-off means (88) which 

interact with this track and are arranged on a rocker 
(24) which is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to 

the wiper shaft (20) and extends transversely to the 
oscillation axis (66). 
Wiping device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the tappet (62) is guided in a longitudinal bore 

(60) of the wiper shaft (20). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the pick-off means are formed by 

rollers (88). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cam track (80) is displaceable 

in the direction of the oscillation axis (66) and bears 
with a pressure piece (82) on the end of the tappet (62) 

facing away from the lever (64). 
Wiping device according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the cam track (80) is spring-loaded in relation 

to the tappet (62). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the cam track (80) is torsionally 

secured in relation to the oscillation axis (66). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that the cam track (80) is situated on 

one front face of a disc-shaped component (82) arranged 
essentially coaxially with the oscillation axis (66), in 

that the disc-shaped component (82) is overlapped by a U-shaped 
frame (84) which is arranged fixed to the frame 

and the U-base (92) of which is situated at a distance 
(104) from the side of the component (82) facing away 

from the tappet (62) and in that a pretensioned pressure 
spring (90) is supported on the two mutually facing sides 

of the U-base (92) and of the component (82). 
Wiping device according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that, in a bore of the U-base (92), a guide pin (94) 

is arranged, which extends parallel to the oscillation 
axis (66) and engages in a recess (96) of the component 

(82). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 8,  
 

characterised in that the rocker (24) is fastened on the 
end of the wiper shaft (20) facing the component (82) and 

in that the pick-off means designed as rollers (88) are 
arranged on the side of the rocker (24) facing the cam 

track (80). 
Wiping device according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the rocker (24) has two mutually opposite rocker 

arms (98, 99) which lie transversely to the oscillation 
axis (66), in that each rocker arm bears a roller (88) 

and in that each roller is assigned a cam (102) of the 
cam track (80). 
Wiping device according to Claim 10, characterised 
in that one rocker arm (99) is provided with an 

extension (100) which extends away from the oscillation 

axis (66) and has a ball pin (26) for connection of an 
oscillation linkage (28). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 10 or 
11, characterised in that the rollers (88) run onto the 

cams (102) when the wiping blade (14) approaches one of 
its two oscillation reversal positions (52, 54). 
Wiping device according to Claim 12, characterised 
in that the rollers (88) are situated on the 

highest regions of the cams (102) when the wiping blade 
(14) is in one of the two oscillation reversal positions 

(52, 54).
