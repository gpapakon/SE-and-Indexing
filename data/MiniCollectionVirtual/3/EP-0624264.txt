<ABSTRACT>
A PID controller which uses a neural network to introduce non-linear functions into conventional PID paradigms. A neural network is substituted for a linear-equation-based controller processor. Dynamic neural network forms are preferred. One implementation allows for switching between the conventional and a neural network controller. The networks are trained on forms of the error from setpoint (or desired value) and the PID input signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of nonlinear 
controllers and is particularly adapted to augment 
conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) 
controllers function more effectively for controlling time 
varying dynamic processes and systems. Controllers are inherently complex since they control 
dynamically changing systems, trying to match a desired 
response with the system output. (The desired response can 
be a setpoint change or the output curve of a reference 
model exhibiting the desired response characteristics. In 
most real control situations, one would not expect, and 
cannot achieve, the process output being brought to 
setpoint instantaneously. Therefore, following the 
presumed optimal curve is the goal.) Both by virtue of and despite their simplicity, linear 
controllers continue to be the workhorse of control 
applications. In particular, the vast majority of current 
applications employ proportional-integral-derivative (PID) 
controllers. In the aerospace as well as process 
industries, PID control has proven to be easy to use and to 
provide adequate performance. PID controllers are also 
general purpose, that is, the same controller structure can 
be used for a broad range of applications. Yet PID control is far from ideal. For any nontrivial 
application, we know that nonlinear controllers can 
substantially outperform a PID. For specific plants, 
high-performing nonlinear controllers can be designed. 
But, in practice, this has required unique designs for each 
enterprise, with concomitant high cost and complexity. At 
this time there is no formal approach for developing 
general nonlinear controllers. We have developed a "NeuroPID Controller" concept that 
is a potential solution to this problem which employs a 
neural network to realize a nonlinear controller but 
retains the PID interface.  
 Thus, it exhibits the easy to use and 
application-independent properties of conventional PID 
controllers, while utilizing the nonlinear dynamical system 
modeling properties of neural networks to realize control 
laws that are more robust, accurate, and generalizable to 
applications than other approaches. PID controllers are used ubiquitously for conventional 
controls. As conventionally formulated, these PID 
controllers use six input signals to generate an output to 
drive the plant process. The inputs are signals which 
represent on the one hand, controller parameters (or gains) 
KC, KI and KD and, on the other, three error signals: the 
error between the setpoint or
