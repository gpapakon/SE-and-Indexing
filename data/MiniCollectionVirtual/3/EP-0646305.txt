<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a solid state light imager or x-ray detector including an array of rows and columns of elements, each element including a photo diode, which converts photons to an electrical signal, and a transistor. Each photo diode has a capacitance associated with it. The cathode of the photo diode in each element is connected to the source of the transistor in the element. The amount of charge removed from each photo diode, after exposure to light, is used to create an image. The image is capable of accurate measurement of charge removed from the photo diodes after the array has been exposed to light, using unipolar measuring circuitry, in spite of charge retention by the transistors and a problem caused by the combination of changes in row voltage and parasitic row to column capacitance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of and apparatus
for detecting light. More particularly, the invention
relates to light imaging using an array of photo
detectors.It is known to manufacture solid state light
imagers or x-ray detectors using an array of rows and
columns of photo detector elements. See for example
US-A-4,996,413, issued to McDaniel et al. on
February 26, 1991, which is incorporated herein by
reference. Each element includes a photo diode, which
converts photons to an electrical signal, and a
transistor. Each photo diode has a capacitance
associated therewith. The cathode of the photo diode
in each element is connected to the source of the
transistor in the element. The anodes of all the photo
diodes are connected together and to a negative bias
voltage -Vb. The drains of transistors in respective
columns are connected to respective column electrodes,
and the gates of transistors in respective rows are
connected to respective row electrodes.To acquire an image from the array, the column
electrodes are connected to a known, stable voltage Vc. 
While the column electrodes are connected to the
voltage Vc, the row electrodes are connected to a
voltage Von which is positive relative to Vc. The photo
diodes will be back biased. The transistors will
conduct and a charge will be placed on each of the
capacitances associated with the photo diodes. After
the diodes have been charged, the row electrodes are
connected to a voltage -Voff which is negative relative
to both Vc and -Vb to turn the transistors off and
prevent them from conducting. The array is then
exposed to light energy, such as produced by a
scintillator which is exposed to x-rays. The photo
diodes will conduct and the capacitance associated with
each photo diode will be partially discharged. The
amount of charge removed from the capacitance
associated with each photo diode will depend on the
intensity and duration of the light energy striking
that particular photo diode. If the duration of light
energy is the same for each of the photo diodes, as is
the case when an x-ray exposure is made, then the
amount of charge removed from the capacitance
associated with the photo diodes will represent the
intensity of the light energy striking the various
photo diodes, and can be read by measuring the amount 
of charge required to restore each photo diode's
capacitance. The charges measured for restoring the
capacitances can therefore be used to create an image.EP-A-0517301 describes an arrangement having photosensitive
or x-ray-sensitive
