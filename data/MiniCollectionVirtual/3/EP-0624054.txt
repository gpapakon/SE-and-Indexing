A printed circuit board having excellent peel 
strength and conductance resistance comprises a 

substrate, a resin insulating layer (2) formed thereon and 
roughened at its surface, and a conductor formed 

thereon, in which at least a portion of the conductor is 
constituted with an eutectic metal layer (1). 

The other portion thereof may be constituted with an ordinary single 
metal layer (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printed circuit 
board, and more particularly to a printed circuit board 
having excellent adhesion property between conductor 
formed through additive process and resin insulating 
layer and conductance resistance. Recently, miniaturization and high-speed 
performance of electron equipment are proceeded with the 
advance of electron industry, and consequently it is 
demanded to have high densification and reliability 
through fine pattern against printed circuit board and 
printed wiring substrate mounting LSI. Lately, an additive process in which an 
adhesive is applied onto a surface of a substrate to 
form a resin insulating layer, and the surface of the 
resin insulating layer is roughened and then subjected 
to an electroless plating to form a conductor is noticed 
as the other method of forming the conductor onto the 
printed wiring substrate, see US-A-4 752 499. According to this method, the conductor is 
formed by electroless plating after the formation of the 
resist, so that it has a merit that conductor wiring  
 
having high density and pattern accuracy can be produced 
with a low cost as compared with an etched foil process 
conducting the formation of pattern through etching 
(which is called as a subtractive process). In the additive process, there have hitherto 
been known a method in which fine unevenness is formed 
on the surface side of the resin insulating layer for 
the formation of the conductor through a chemical 
etching as a means for improving the adhesion property 
between conductor and resin insulating layer 
(hereinafter referred to as peel strength). According 
to this method, the unevenness of the surface of the 
resin insulating layer is subjected to a metal plating 
such as copper plating, whereby the peel strength can be 
improved through an anchor effect based on the 
unevenness. Such an improvement of the peel strength 
through the anchor effect is generally carried out by 
enlarging the braking surface or by increasing the 
strength of the conductor metal or the resin insulating 
layer. In recent additive type printed circuit board 
requiring the formation of wiring with high density and 
pattern accuracy, it is required to make small anchor 
formed by surface roughening of the resin insulating 
layer in order to precisely form the fine pattern of the 
resist. Therefore, this conventional technique causes a 
problem that as the anchor becomes small, the breaking  
 
area is also small and hence the peel strength 
considerably lowers. In
