A shaving foil mounting structure for a dry 
shaving apparatus, comprising a shaving foil (4) attached 

in arched form to a shaving head frame (2) by means of 
bolts (12) or the like, against which foil an inner cutter 

(5) operating in a reciprocating motion is resiliently 
engaged, said foil having on its longitudinal 

sides a strip member (16) each which is provided with 
mounting members cooperating with the bolts (12), 


characterized in that
 the two strip members (16) are provided 
on the outer surface (15) of the shaving foil (4), 

that the mounting members of each strip member (16) that 
cooperate with the bolts (12) are configured as two 

cutouts (21) open in the direction of the perforated area 
(20) of the shaving foil (4), each of said cutouts accommodating 

a respective detent means (23) movable in the 
plane of the strip member (16), and that each strip member 

(16) includes adjacent to one of the two cutouts (21) 
a slot (25) open in the direction of the perforated area 

(20) of the shaving foil (4), said slot being in engagement 
with a rib member (14) formed on the associated location 

of the shaving head frame (2) with the shaving 
foil (4) in assembled condition. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the detent means is configured 
as a hook member (23) extending upwardly from the 

base (22) of the respective cutout (21) towards the opening 
thereof, said hook member being movable in the plane 

of the strip member (16) transversely to the sliding motion. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the angled ends (24) of 
the two hook members (23) of a strip member (16) are 

arranged so as to face each other. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
bolts (12) are of a rectangular cross-section and are 

provided with a dovetail guide (13) each on one of the 
lo
ngitudinal walls (11) of the shaving head frame (2) on 
the vertical sides facing each other, that the longitudinal 

sides (26) of the respective cutout (21) in the 
strip member (16) that are associated with the guides 

(13) have beveled edges, and that the guides (13) are in 
engagement with the beveled longitudinal sides (26) when 

the shaving foil (4) is in mounted condition.  
 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 each 
cutout (21) is dimensioned such that in the rest position 

a defined distance (a) is maintained between the angled 
end (24) of each hook member (23) and the bolt (12) with 

the shaving foil (4) in assembled condition. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
any one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
slot (25) is enlarged at its base. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
any one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
thickness of the longitudinal walls (11) of the shaving 

head frame (2) in the area (28) of the shaving foil attachment 
locations is reduced by the amount of thickness 

of the strip member (16), such that the remaining section 
(29) of the longitudinal wall (11) is flush with the 

strip member (16) of the shaving foil (4) when mounted. 
A shaving foil mounting structure as claimed in 
any one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 each 
strip member (16) has on its inner side close to the 

shaving foil (4) gripping ridges (27), and that the shaving 
foil (4) is suitably cut out at this particular location.
