<ABSTRACT>
Multiple purpose structure for training and playing of at least one individual or team sport comprising vertical walls (1, 2, 3, and 4) opening onto training areas (E, G, H and I), a gangway (9) in its upper part for supervising players on each of the training areas, means associated with the sport, for example, basketball nets (16, 17, 18 and 19) and openings (10, 11) serving as goals in games such as football.

<CLAIMS>
Multiple purpose structure for the simultaneous 
exercise and playing of at least one sport by several 

persons or teams, characterized in that it fills a 
central position and comprises at least two walls 

rigidly connected with each other and presenting on 
their external side means related to this sport, in 

that each wall is opening on at least one playing 
surface and in that at least one foot-bridge connects 

the high part of the walls and in that climbing means 
associated with at least one of the wall lead to said 

foot-bridge. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises three walls forming a triangle and 

defining at least three playing surfaces around them. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises four walls forming a square and 

defining at least four playing surfaces around them. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises five walls forming a pentagon and 

defining at least five playing surfaces around them. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises six walls forming a hexagon and 

defining at least six playing surfaces around them. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in  
 

that it has a circular section and that its 
circumference defines several vertical wall segments, 

each of them opening on a playing surface. 
Structure as claimed in one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that said means provided on a 

wall are formed by at least one basket fixed directly 
or by means of a pannel on said wall. 
Structure as claimed in one of the foregoing 
claims characterized in that said means comprises goals 

arranged in said walls. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the playing surfaces are 

demarcated by a signalling extending radially along a 
line beginning at the geometric center of the 

structure, passing through the intersection of two 
walls and going up to the external end of each surface. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the foot-bridge is arranged on 

the innerside of the wall and in parallel direction to 
it. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the foot-bridge extends at least 

partially in a perpendicular direction to the wall. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 10, 
and 11, characterized in that the climbing means are 

formed by at least one staircase. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
10 and 11, characterized in that the climbing means are  

 
formed by at least one ladder. 
Structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
10 and 11, characterized in that the climbing means are 

formed by pistons or rock-climbing supports arranged on 
at least one side of the wall. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the central part delimited by the walls comprises 

gymnastic devices associated or not to the playing of 
one sport or encouraging its exercise. 
Structure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises further a central shaft on which a 

foot-bridge fulling the most part of the space 
comprised between the walls is laying on and in that a 

radial separation connects said shaft to the lateral 
ends of the walls opening on the playing surfaces, two 

adjacent radial separations forming a goal for the 
ballsport. 
Structure as claimed in claim 16, characterized 
in that the separations are nets.
