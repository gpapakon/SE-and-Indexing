<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the prevention and treat 
ment of anaemic conditions in animals and humans and there 
is provided an oral composition containing a compound 
containing iron in a highly bioavailable form which composition 
has a palatability allowing it to be ingested voluntarily 
by newborn, suckling individuals in amounts sufficient 
to cover their physiological requirements for iron. The 
composition according to the invention may also include 
substances such as dietary fiber-containing ingredients 
which prevent or cure diarrhoea including scouring in young 
animals. Furthermore there is provided a method of producing 
an iron-containing composition according to the 
invention. Anaemic conditions may occur as a result of losses of blood 
from an individual or as a result of insufficient supply of 
bioavailable iron in the diet. In this respect, a particular 
problem exists in the pig industry. Newborn piglets 
have a total body reservoir of iron which is about 50 mg. 
During the first 2-3 weeks of life (the suckling period) 
their weight gain is so rapid that the daily requirement 
for iron is about 7-10 mg in order to maintain a physiologically 
normal level of haemoglobin in their blood, i.e. 
about 90-120 g per l. However, the daily supply of iron 
from the sow's milk is only about 1 mg and inevitably, a 
serious and often fatal, anaemic condition will occur 
within a few days after birth, if a supplementary iron 
supply is not provided.  
 Presently, such a supplementary supply of iron is normally 
provided by giving newborn piglets an injection of an iron-containing 
substance such as an iron dextran. Obviously, 
this method of supplying iron is very labour-consuming and 
in addition it involves a risk of spreading infectious 
microorganisms via the injection needle and of causing a 
stress condition in the animals. It is therefore not surprising that several attempts have 
been made to provide iron-containing compositions which by 
oral administration to suckling piglets might supplement 
their insufficient supply of iron. A general problem associated with oral administration to 
suckling animals of iron-containing compositions is the 
fact that their energy requirements is substantially covered 
via the mother's milk and hence they show no willingness 
to ingest more than a few grammes of solid sources 
of nutrients and in addition, suckling animals are extremely 
selective with regard to which solid materials they are 
willing to ingest. Sources of iron in oral compositions
