<ABSTRACT>
An on demand vehicle drive system 
monitors vehicle performance and operating conditions 

and controls torque delivery to the vehicle wheels. 
The system includes a plurality of speed and position 

sensors, a transfer case (28) having primary and secondary 
output shafts (40,26) driving primary and secondary drive 

shafts, differentials and axles and a microcontroller (200). 
The sensors include a vehicle speed sensor, a pair of 

primary and secondary drive shaft speed sensors, and 
brake and driveline status sensors. The transfer case 

includes a modulating electromagnetic clutch (124) comprising 
a primary, cone clutch assembly (125) which functions as a 

pilot device to actuate a secondary, disc pack clutch 
assembly (150). The electromagnetic clutch is controlled by 

the microcontroller which is incrementally engaged to 
transfer torque from the primary output shaft to the 

secondary output shaft. When the speed of either the 
front or the rear drive shaft overruns, i.e., exceeds, 

the speed of the other drive shaft by a predetermined 
value related to the vehicle speed and other variables, 

indicating that wheel slip is present, clutch current 
is incrementally increased to increase clutch 

engagement and torque transfer to the secondary drive 
shaft. When wheel slip is reduced below the 

predetermined value the current to the clutch is 
incrementally reduced. The system also senses and 

compensates for the speed differences between the 
primary and secondary drive axles caused by the use of 

different, mixed tire, sizes, e.g., a compact spare, at 
one or more tire locations by adjusting the 

predetermined value. The method of operating such a 
system is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a four-wheel vehicle
drive system and more specifically to an adaptive
vehicle drive system which incrementally shifts from
two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive upon sensing
certain conditions.The performance advantages of four-wheel vehicle
drive systems are well recognized. Improved vehicle
stability while traversing rain soaked or ice or snow
covered highways, handling and control on gravel or
uneven pavement and simply maintaining traction in off
road situations are all readily acknowledged benefits.
Concomitant and less desirable attributes of four-wheel
drive systems relate to reduced gas mileage from
increased drive line friction and increased vehicle
weight. Such increased drive line friction occurs in
part time four-wheel drive systems which rotationally
couple the front and rear vehicle propshafts. Such
vehicle weight increases are particularly pronounced if
the system is designed with a differential between the
front and rear drive shafts for full-time engagement
and operation rather than intermittent operation when
conditions specifically demand it.Furthermore, while part time four-wheel drive
systems which lock the front and rear propshafts
together provide obvious benefits of traction and
stability in straight line driving, the disparity
between the ground speed at the front wheels and the
ground speed at the rear wheels during cornering can
itself result in wheel slip and hopping of the vehicle.
Thus, allowing the front and rear output shafts of the 
transfer case to operate at different speeds during
cornering is beneficial.Many four-wheel drive systems employing diverse
control and torque distribution strategies have been
designed and utilized. These various approaches are
embodied in United States patents.For example, US-A-4417641
teaches an automatic four-wheel drive system having an
electromagnetic clutch and steering sensor. When the
steering wheels are turned greater than a predetermined
angle, the electromagnetic clutch is de-energized and
two of the driving wheels are disconnected. The system
also includes a slip sensor.US-A-4718303 is co-owned by
the assignee herein. It discloses a transfer case
having an electromagnetic ramp clutch which is
modulated to adjusted the torque distribution in a full
time four-wheel drive system.In US-A-4937750, a
microcomputer compares signals from front and rear axle
speed sensors. If the difference is greater than a
certain value, a clutch is engaged to interconnect the
front and rear prop shafts to prevent
