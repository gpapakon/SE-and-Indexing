<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a method for removing residual sulfur from a hydrotreated naphtha feedstock (1). The process comprises contacting the naphtha feedstock (1) with a first solid sulfur sorbent (2) comprising a metal on a support to thereby form a first effluent. The effluent is then contacted with a sulfur conversion catalyst in reactor (6) comprising a Group VIII metal in the presence of hydrogen, with the resulting effluent being contacted with a second solid sulfur sorbent (7) containing a Group IA or IIA metal, to thereby lower the sulfur content of the feedstock to less than 10 ppb, and to as low as 1 ppb or less. The feedstock can then be safely used with highly sulfur sensitive zeolitic reforming catalysts without adversely affecting the useful life of the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the removal of sulfur from a 
hydrocarbon feedstock. In another embodiment, the present invention relates 
to a reforming process using a highly sulfur sensitive catalyst which can be 
efficiently and effectively run for up to two years. Generally, sulfur occurs in petroleum and syncrude stocks as 
hydrogen sulfide, organic sulfides, organic disulfides, mercaptans, also 
known as thiols, and aromatic ring compounds such as thiophene, 
benzothiophene and related compounds. The sulfur in aromatic sulfur-containing 
ring compounds will be herein referred to as "thiophene sulfur". Conventionally, feeds with substantial amounts of sulfur, for 
example, those with more than 10 ppm sulfur, are hydrotreated with 
conventional hydrotreating catalysts under conventional conditions, thereby 
changing the form of most of the sulfur in the feed to hydrogen sulfide. 
Then, the hydrogen sulfide is removed by distillation, stripping or related 
techniques. Unfortunately, these techniques often leave some traces of sulfur 
in the feed, including thiophene sulfur, which is the most difficult type to 
convert. Such hydrotreated naphtha feeds are frequently used as feeds for 
catalytic dehydrocyclization, also known as reforming. Catalytic reforming 
processes play an integral role in upgrading naphtha feedstocks to high 
octane gasoline blend stocks and for chemicals such as benzene, toluene and 
xylenes. These processes have become more important in recent years 
because of the increase in demand for low-lead and unleaded gasolines. 
However, some of the catalysts used in reforming are extremely sulfur 
sensitive, particularly those that contain zeolitic components. It is generally  
 
recognized, therefore, that the sulfur content of the feedstock must be 
minimized to prevent poisoning of such reforming catalysts. One conventional method for removing residual hydrogen sulfide and 
mercaptan sulfur is the use of sulfur sorbents. See, for example, US-A-4,204,997 
and 4,163,706. 
The concentration of sulfur in this form can be 
reduced to considerably less than 1 ppm by using the appropriate sorbents 
and conditions, but it has been found to be difficult to remove sulfur to less 
than 0.1 ppm, or to remove residual thiophene sulfur. See, for example, 
US-A-4,179,361, 
and particularly Example 1 of that patent. Very low space 
velocities are required to remove thiophene sulfur, requiring large reaction 
vessels filled with sorbent. Even with these precautions, traces of thiophene 
sulfur
