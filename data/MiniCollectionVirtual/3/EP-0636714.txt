<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing
a composite material having a metal oxide layer of a Y123
crystal structure.One known method for the preparation of a metal
oxide crystal having a Y123 crystal structure includes
contacting a seed material with a molten mixture of metal
oxides to allow the desired crystal to grow on the seed
material. The term "Y123 crystal structure" used in the
present specification and claims is intended to refer to
a crystal structure similar to that of YBa2Cu3O7-x where x
is a number of from 0-1. The term "Y123 metal oxide" is
intended to refer to a metal oxide having a Y123 crystal
structure.As the seed crystal, a magnesia single crystal,
a Sm123 metal oxide crystal or a Y123 metal oxide crystal
has been hitherto used. The use of a magnesia single
crystal has a problem that the crystal which has grown on
the magnesia seed crystal forms a Y123 polycrystal rather
than a single Y123 crystal. When a Y123 crystal is used
as the seed crystal, the molten mixture climbs along the
seed crystal so that a holder thereof will be wetted and
reacted with the molten mixture.EP-A-0400524 discloses a superconductive
article comprising a substrate and an oriented layer of a
metal oxide crystal of the formula:
LnBa2Cu3Ox
wherein Ln is an optional rare earth element.
The article is obtained by forming a thin layer of a
mixture of LnBa2Cu3Ox and Ln2BaCuOx on the substrate, then
locally and sequentially melting and solidifying this
layer, then forming a second thin layer of mixed oxides
(CuO, BaCuO2 and BaO) on the first layer, and heating and
cooling the layered structure thereby forming a film of
an oriented LnBa2Cu3Ox crystal on the substrate. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method of preparing a composite material having
a Y123 metal oxide crystal layer grown on a thin Y123
metal oxide film and having excellent crystallinity and
crystal orientation.More particularly, the present invention
provides a method of preparing a composite material
comprising a substrate, an oriented film having a
thickness of 0.01 µm to 1 µm and provided on a surface of
said substrate and formed of a first metal oxide which
has a crystal structure of a Y123 metal oxide and which
has the formula:
LnBa2Cu3Oy
wherein Ln stands for Y or an element belonging to the
lanthanoid series and y is a number of from 6-7, and a
layer of a second metal oxide crystal provided over a
surface of said oriented film and having the formula:
LnBa2Cu3Oy
wherein Ln stand for Y or an element belonging to the
lant
