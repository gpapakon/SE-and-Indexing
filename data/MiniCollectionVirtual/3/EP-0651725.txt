<ABSTRACT>
Lift truck accessories for stacking and moving stacks of tires are disclosed. The tire-stacking device (10, 210) includes an elongated platform (28) upon which a plurality of tires may be placed side by side when the device is in its horizontal position. The tire-stacking device can be raised by the lifting apparatus of a lift truck (20) from its horizontal position to a vertical position. When in its vertical position, the stack of tires is supported by a clamping arrangement (50) that is attached to the base end (13) of the tire-stacking device. A second embodiment of the invention is a tire transporter (230) that is always maintained in a vertical position but includes a clamping arrangement (233) which is similar to the tire-stacking device. The tire transporter is relatively shorter than the tire-stacking device and enables a lift truck operator to move stacks of tires through low-clearance areas such as under doorways as well as into and out of trucks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending
United States Patent Application Ser. No. 07/917,779, filed
on June 21, 1992 and entitled TIRE-STACKING DEVICE.This invention relates generally to devices for use in
cooperative arrangement with a lift truck, and in particular,
to stacking and transporting devices for use in stacking and
moving stacks of tires.In the truck tire retreading business, used truck tires
are normally brought into the plant and then are stacked on
pallets eight tires high until the tires are ready for
processing. Because these tires weigh on the order of 125
pounds each, they are generally too heavy for a single man to
lift and place the last few tires on the top of a stack.
Thus, it often requires two men to complete each eight-tire
stack. After being stacked on a pallet, the tires can be
moved about the plant by a single man using an ordinary
forklift truck.The present method of manually stacking tires on pallets
suffers from two distinct drawbacks. First, it is
inefficient to require the use of two persons to stack the
tires. This inefficiency is even more significant when one
realizes that the second person is only needed to stack the
last few tires but is not needed to begin the stack of tires
or to move the tires around the plant once stacked. Second,
when only a single person is available to stack the tires,
that person runs the risk of injury due to overexertion in 
having to stack heavy fires to heights above their chest level.
What is needed are tire-stacking and transporting devices that are
capable of being used without pallets in conjunction with a
forklift truck and which enable a single person to stack tires and
transport the stack in an efficient manner without running the
risk of injury due to overexertion.CH-A-337124 disclose a device for a stacker truck for the vertical
stacking of unit loads. The device comprises a carrier, a first end
of which may be connected to the lifting carriage of the stacker
truck. Vertical movement of the lifting carriage moves the carrier
from an initial horizontal position to a final vertical position.PL-A-39303 discloses an apparatus for the mechanical loading of
materials comprising a three sided wheeled box attached to a
tractor. The box may be tilted in order to retain bags when in
transit and a plunger is provided to eject bags from the box.US-A-3084820 discloses an industrial hand truck adapted for
carrying cases of bottled goods. The truck includes a pair of co-operating
jaw members pivotally mounted upon a frame,

<CLAIMS>
A tire transporter (230) for use in co-operative arrangement with
a lift truck (20) having a lifting apparatus (21), the transporter (230)

comprising: a vertical frame (231) having a length and a base end; a horizontal
support structure including a pair of gripping arms (234) having root ends

pivotally attached to said base end of said frame (231), each of said arms (234)

having a free end extending away from said frame (231) and a support surface
(235) extending inwardly toward the other arm, said arms (234) being capable

of pivoting toward and away from each other, said support surfaces (235)
being capable of supporting a stack of tires, and each of said arms (234) being

biased toward each other, characterised by said free end of each of said arms
(234) having a roller (236) mounted thereon for riding against a tire to spread

said arms (234) apart and means for releasably connecting said frame (231) to
the lifting apparatus (21) of the lift truck (20).
The tire transporter (230) of Claim 1 wherein said connecting
means includes a hook means (250) having a hook (254) attached to the lifting

apparatus (21) of the lift truck (20); and said frame (231) includes a first
lifting element (237) that is hookable to said hook (254). 
The fire transporter (230) of claim 2 wherein said hook
means(250) includes a sliding pin (252) having an open position

and a closed position; and wherein said first lifting element (237)
is trapped within said hook (254) when said sliding pin (252) is in

said closed position, and said first lifting element (237) can enter
said hook (254) when said sliding pin (252) is in said open

position.
The fire transporter (230) of claim 3 wherein said hook
means (250) is arranged so that said sliding pin (252) automatically

fails to said closed position under the action of gravity; said
sliding pin (252) includes a push nob (253) that extends below said

hook means (250) such that moving said push nob (253) toward
said hook means (250) moves said sliding pin (253) toward said

open position; and said push nob (253) is pushed toward said
hook means (250) when the lifting apparatus (21) of the lift truck

(20) is lowered to a position adjacent the ground.
The tire transporter (230) of claims 1 to 4 wherein said
length of said vertical frame (231) is shorter than the height of the

lift truck (20). 
The tire transporter (230) of claim 2 wherein said frame
(231) further includes a second lifting element; and wherein said

hook means (350) defines a bore (354) herein adapted to receive
said second lifting element therein.
The tire transporter (230) of claim 6 wherein said second
lifting element is a vertical lifting pin (331) having one end

attached to said frame (231) above said first lifting element (237)
and an opposite free end extending downwardly toward said first

lifting element (237).
The tire transporter (230) of claim 6 or 7 wherein said bore
(354) extends downwardly into said hook means (350) from a top

surface thereof.
The tire transporter of claim 8 wherein said vertical lifting
pin (331) is centrally positioned on said frame (231).
