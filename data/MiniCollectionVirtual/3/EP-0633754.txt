<ABSTRACT>
A beam (10) adapted for implantation within a bone is able to support bending and torsional loading forces applied thereto. The beam (10) has a stiffness defined by a modulus elasticity, which stiffness varies along the length of the beam to match the corresponding stiffness of the cortical bone adjacent the beam after implantation within the bone. The beam is made from an elongated core (14) formed of chopped carbon fibers embedded in a thermoplastic polymer matrix. Encasing the core (14) is a sheath (16) formed of carbon reinforced filament fibers embedded in the thermoplastic polymer which is wound in spiral formation around the core (14) and molded thereto. The winding angle and the sheath (16) thickness along the beam may be varied to vary the modulus of elasticity to match that of the cortical bone adjacent thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prosthetic hip stem comprising a core and
a sheath formed of composite material, and having a trunion at a proximal end.A prosthetic hip stem according to the features of the preamble
of Claim 1 is known from the document WO-A-9118562.Stems for orthopedic implants which can withstand both bending and torsion
loads are useful in a variety of orthopedic uses. One type of stem which has received
considerable attention in the orthopedic field is for a hip joint replacement device. In
basic design, this device includes an elongate curved stem which is adapted for receipt
in a cavity formed in the proximal region of a femur, and a spherical head carried on
a neck at the upper end of the stem. When implanted in operative position, the device
functions as a load transfer member between the pelvis and femur, and as such, must
accommodate considerable bending, axial compression and torsional forces applied
across the joint to the femur.Various constructions have been proposed previously for hip joint devices of
this type. In three of these constructions, the curved stem is adapted for insertion into
a bone cavity, and the neck is adapted to support the spherical head, usually via a
conical trunion joint. Usually the stem and neck are formed as a single piece, and the
spherical head is separately attached to the neck, preferably after inserting the stem
into the bone. In one construction the stem and neck are formed as a unitary metal
piece from stainless steel or, more preferably, from a cobalt chrome or titanium alloy.
An advantage of an all metal construction is that the relatively thick metal stem and
neck provide adequate bending and shear strength, so that problems of stem fracture
or fatigue are minimal. A disadvantage of the construction is a high degree of stress
on certain regions of the bone, and stress protection or shielding in other bone regions.
Both high stress and stress shielding can cause bone deterioration and resorption,
leading to areas of bone weakness and loss of bone support for the prosthesis. The related problems of bone stress and stress protection which can occur in a hip
joint replacement can be understood from the mechanics of weight load transfer across
the hip joint device. Normally, much of the weight load is transferred to the femur near
the upper joint region and this load is distributed to and carried by the underlying cortical
bone region and the prosthesis stem. The distribution of forces in the underlying cortical
region and prosthesis stem
