<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an upper tool holder (4) for a punch or the like, with at least two punching tools (5) arranged next to one another, preferably each punching tool (5) consisting of a punching ram (7), a ram holder (8) and a coupling nut (9) connecting the punching ram (7) to the ram holder (8), with a carrier body (10), with a receiving plate (11), with tool guides (12) for each punching tool (5) which are arranged next to one another in the receiving plate (11) and which extend in the punching direction, and with an especially pivotable closing cover (14) fastened to the carrier body (10), especially articulated pivotably about an articulation axle (13) and removable in a plane perpendicular to the punching direction, the upper ends of the punching tools (5) being guided in the tool guides (12) so as to be displaceable in the punching direction and so as to be limited in one direction by bearing flanges (15). In this upper tool carrier (4), the guidance of the punching tools (5) is not influenced by the attachment of the closing cover (14) to the carrier body (10), specifically in that the closing cover (14) comprises the receiving plate (11), in that the tool guides (12) are closed annularly in the plane perpendicular to the punching direction, and in that, when the closing cover (14) is removed, especially swung away, from the carrier body (10), the punching tools (5) can be pushed into the tool guides (12) or pulled out of the tool guides (12) in the punching direction or in the direction perpendicular to the receiving plate (11).

<CLAIMS>
An upper tool holder (4) for a punch or the like, with at 
least two punching tools (5) disposed side by side, with a 

support body (10), with a seating with tool guides (12) for each 
punching tool (5) disposed side by side in the seating and 

extending in the direction of punching, and with a closure cap 
(11), particularly a pivoting closure cap, which can be removed 

in a plane perpendicular to the direction of punching and which 
is fastened, in particular pivotally linked about a pivot pin 

(13), to the support body (10), wherein the upper ends of the 
punching tools (5) in the tool guides (12) are displaceably 

guided in the direction of punching, restricted in one direction 
by contact flanges (15), wherein seating cavities (17) for the 

upper ends of the punching tools (5) are provided on the support 
body (10) above the tool guides (12) and below a force 

transmission face (16), and the seating cavities (17) can be 
bridged by force transmission slides (18) or the like which are 

displaceable substantially perpendicularly to the direction of 
punching, wherein a lifting lever (20) disposed on the support 

body (10) is assigned to each punching tool (5) and the lifting 
lever (20) laterally engages the upper end of the associated 

punching tool (5) from below, and wherein the upper end of the 
punching tool (5) can be lifted into the seating cavity (17) by 

means of the lifting lever (20) when the force transmission slide 
(18) is withdrawn, characterised in that the seating and the 

closure cap (11) are integrated in a seating plate (14) which can 
be removed from the support body (10), that the tool guides (12) 

are closed in a ring-like manner in the plane perpendicular to 
the direction of punching, that the punching tools (5) can be 

inserted in the tool guides (12) or withdrawn from the tool 
guides (12) in the direction of punching or in a direction 

perpendicular to the seating plate (14) when the seating plate 
(14) is removed from, particularly swung away from, the support 

body (10), and that the seating plate (14) has an engagement 
channel (21) at each tool guide (12) for the lifting lever (20), 

which engagement channel leads into the tool guide (12) below the  
 

contact flange (15) and is disposed on the face of the seating 
plate facing the support body (10). 
A tool holder according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the engagement channels (21) in the seating plate (14) on the 

faces facing the pivot pin (13) for the pivotal coupling to the 
support body (10) are widened from the tool guides (12) towards 

the face facing the support body (10). 
A tool holder according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the centre point of the pivot pin (13) for coupling the 

seating plate (14) to the support body (10) is disposed to the 
side at a considerable distance from the nearest edge of the 

nearest tool guide (12). 
A tool holder according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the pivot pin (13) for coupling the seating plate (14) to the 

support body (10) is disposed to the side at a distance of 100 
mm to 200 mm from the nearest edge of the nearest tool guide 

(12). 
A tool holder according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the pivot pin (13) for coupling the seating plate (14) to the 

support body (10) is disposed to the side at a distance of 150 
mm from the nearest edge of the nearest tool guide (12). 
A tool holder according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
the seating plate (14) can be locked to the support body (10) by 

means of a locking apparatus (22) disposed on the side opposite 
the pivot pin (13), characterised in that a second locking 

apparatus (23) is provided near the pivot pin (13). 
A tool holder according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the second locking apparatus (23) is disposed below a part (24) 

of the seating plate (14) which is situated here and which 
extends towards the pivot pin (13).
