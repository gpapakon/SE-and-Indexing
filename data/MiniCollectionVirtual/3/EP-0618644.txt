<ABSTRACT>
An electrical, female, box-shaped terminal 
(10) formed from a one-piece metal stamping and having 

a generally planar bottom (20), a pair of spaced sides 
(22,24), a first upper member defining a resilient 

contact arm (26) integral with one of the sides and 
extending transversely thereof towards the other side, 

and a second upper member defining a resilient back-up 
spring (28) integral with the other of said sides, 

which back-up spring (28) extends transversely of the 
sides and overlays the contact arm (26). The contact 

arm (26) has a forward end section (30) which extends 
downwardly towards, but spaced from, the bottom (20) 

to define a gap (32) therebetween into which a mating 
male blade terminal (12) can be inserted. The forward 

end section (30) is so shaped as to ensure that the 
contact arm (26) exerts a contact force upon the 

mating male blade terminal (12) in a direction that is 
substantially normal to the plane of the terminal 

(12). This arrangement allows the box-shaped terminal 
(10) of the invention to be used in conjunction with 

mating male blade terminals of differing thicknesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrical connector and, more particularly, to an 
electrical, female, box-shaped terminal having a 
resilient contact arm and which is of a design such 
that it can be connected to different thicknesses of 
mating male blade terminals. Heretofore, female, box-shaped electrical 
terminals have been provided. These terminals 
included either a single or double resilient contact 
arms for engaging a male mating-blade terminal when 
the latter was inserted therein. U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,586,775 and 3,310,772, assigned to the General 
Motors Corporation, an assignee of the present 
invention, shows such terminals respectively. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,586,775 also shows a cantilevered support 
arm 48 for engaging the end of a resilient contact arm 
in the form of a tongue 44 to increase the contact 
force on a male blade terminal when the latter is 
inserted between the tongue 44 and a dimple 46 on the 
floor of the female terminal. Whilst the prior box-shaped female terminals 
have been highly successful in use, they nevertheless 
are primarily designed for receipt of male blade 
terminals of a standard nominal thickness dimension. 
However, in different countries in the world, the 
standard thickness of male blade terminals varies and 
thus different sizes of female terminals must be 
designed to accommodate each thickness of male blade 
terminal. Also, it is highly desirable to have a low 
insertion force required when connecting a male blade 
terminal to a box-shaped, female terminal whilst also 
having a relatively high contact force between the 
terminals to provide a connection therebetween which 
ensures good electrical conductivity. This is 
especially so when a plurality of male terminals  
 
contained in a multi-cavity insulated electrical 
connector body are simultaneously mated to a plurality 
of box-shaped, female terminals contained in a 
multi-cavity insulated electrical connector body. 
Whilst some trade-off between the insertion force and 
the mating contact force has to be made in designing 
electrical terminals, it has been found that, if the 
contact force between the male terminal and the female 
terminal is normal to the direction of insertion of 
the male blade terminal, a relatively high contact 
force can be obtained without creating a high 
insertion force. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a new and improved box-shaped, 
female electrical terminal having a deflectable 
contact arm and which is constructed and arranged
