<ABSTRACT>
A rotor (5) of an electric motor for a compressor which can 
prevent the generation of an eddy current, reduce the flux 

leakage between adjacent magnetic poles, thereby enhancing 
the operation efficiency of the motor and reducing the size 

of the compressor. A first end surface member (103) formed from a 
nonmagnetic material, a second end surface member (110) formed 

from a nonmagnetic member and a rotor core (101) are integrally 
caulked by a caulking member (111 to 114). The rotor core is provided 

with a gap for preventing the short circuit of the magnetic 
flux caused between adjacent magnetic poles. The gap 

communicates with a through hole into which the caulking 
member is inserted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the structure of the rotor of an electric motor for a
compressor.Conventional rotors of electric motors for a compressor generally has the following
structures.The rotor described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 52359/1982 is produced by
inserting a laminated rotor core and magnetic materials into a metal pipe, and integrally die-casting
these elements.The rotor described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 246748/1990 is produced by
inserting a laminated rotor core and magnetic materials into a metal pipe in the same way as
in the above-described rotor, and integrally clamping these elements. At the time of
clamping, an air gap portion is provided between adjacent magnetic materials so as to safely
separate the poles of the magnetic materials, thereby enhancing the efficiency.Another rotor is described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 23584/1985. In this rotor,
magnetic materials which constitute the magnetic poles are inserted (embedded) into the
rotor core. This rotor is used for a synchronous motor which is capable of self starting.Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 185247/1992 discloses another rotor, which is composed
of magnetic materials embedded into the salient pole portions of the rotor core which has a
salient-pole structure. The rotor core with the magnetic materials embedded therein and
end surface members for covering both end surface thereof are arranged, and a rotary shaft
is integrally press-fitted into the rotor core in this state.The conventional rotors having the above-described structures, however, have problems
such as much eddy current loss caused by the cage portion of a die-cast material (e.g. zinc
and aluminium), much eddy current loss in a metal pipe, and difficulty in the maintenance
of the high dimensional accuracy at the time of production due to the projection provided
on the rotor core so as to prevent the movement of the magnetic materials. In the rotor provided with air gaps for separating poles, when a breakage such as cracking
is produced on the magnetic material (especially, ferrite) due to a thermal shock or a
mechanical shock applied to the rotor, the fragments of the magnetic material are flown
into the air gaps, which sometimes leads to a further breakage or chipping.In some rotors, an eddy current is produced by the secondary conductor in the rotor core,
and since part of the magnetic flux produced from the magnetic material is short-circuited
in the rotor core (conductor), the operation efficiency of the motor is lowered.Other
