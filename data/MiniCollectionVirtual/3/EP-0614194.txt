<ABSTRACT>
An encased electronic instrument of the type having a front panel 
bearing controls and visual displays that is clamped to the forward 

periphery of a box-like case, is provided with a resiliently 
deformable and elastically stretchable identifying shield 

surrounding and overlying the front panel, and extending a given 
distance rearwardly generally parallel to the outer surface of the 

instrument case. The shield is preformed, with an outer peripheral 
band defining an open center having a shape slightly smaller than, 

but generally conforming to the outer shape of the front panel and 
the rearwardly extending outer surfaces immediately adjacent to the 

front panel. A first inwardly extending flange projects from the 
forward edges of the peripheral band in overlying relationship with 

the outer edges of the front panel of the instrument, and a second 
inwardly extending flange projects from the rearward edges of the 

peripheral band to enhance frictional engagement between the band 
and the underlying outer surfaces of the instrument. The second 

inwardly extending flange may also serve to retain the shield on 
the front panel and to provide sealing between the panel and the 

case, by being clamped between the rear surface of the front panel 
and the forward edges of the side surface portions of the case, 

replacing the sealing gasket previously described as being used in 
the prior art. The material from which the shield is formed is 

resiliently deformable and elastically stretchable, so that it can 
be stretch-fitted over the front panel of an instrument in 

peripheral elastically gripping relationship; the thickness of the 
body of the shield is selected so that the force of unintended 

impacts with the outer surface of the shield will be absorbed in 
part in the shield and will be transmitted in part to the abutting 

surface of a panel in which the instrument is mounted, and will 
also be transmitted, with reduced intensity, to the outer surface 

of the instrument. The shield also serves to provide convenient and  
 

ready visual differentiation among a plurality of clustered 
instruments, as in a control board, through the use of distinctive 

colors which may be applied to the surface of the shield or which 
may be made an inherent part of the shield material. Visual 

identification is further enhanced by molding distinctive words or 
symbols into a visible surface of the shield.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
protection against physical damage of instrument cases of the type
having controls and visual displays mounted on a front panel, and
more specifically relates to a protective
shield for the front panels of such instruments as well as to such
instruments having protective shields mounted thereon.Instruments, such as electronic meters, of the type enclosed
in a generally rigid housing formed of metal or other suitable
material, and having a front panel bearing visual displays and/or
control devices in various combinations, are well known. Such
instruments have been in general use in commercial, industrial and
scientific applications for many years. In the most common
configuration, the front panels of such instruments are rectangular
in shape, and they are fastened to a rectangular box-like housing
having side surface portions extending rearwardly from the four
edges of the panel in substantially perpendicular relationship.
Frequently, the periphery of the rear surface of the front panel is
butted against the forward edges of the side surface portions of
the housing, and fasteners such as screws pass through the front
panel and engage threaded openings in the housing to clamp the
panel and the housing together. Most often, a sealing gasket in
the form of a rectangular band is clamped between the rear surface
of the front panel and the forward edges of the side surface
portions of the housing to seal the corresponding joint against
entry of dust, moisture and the like. In a well-known arrangement, a plurality of instruments are mounted in parallel
and/or coordinate arrays with the front portion of each instrument projecting slightly
forward of a generally planar display "board" that may be positioned vertically or inclined
at an angle away from vertical. In other applications, one or more instruments may stand
about on table tops or similar support surfaces, close to the sources of the electrical
signals that are being controlled and/or displayed.Applications of the type described above frequently involve substantial amounts
of physical activity in relatively close proximity to one or more sensitive instruments.
Under such circumstances, various objects being handled by operators, such as heavy
tools, test specimens, industrial containers and even other electronic and mechanical
instruments, frequently and unavoidably come into unintended contact with the exposed
front panels of the instruments being used. The shocks, dents and other damage caused
by such unintended

<CLAIMS>
A protected instrument casing comprising an instrument case (10) of the type
having a housing with a front panel (12) and side surface portions (14) extending

rearwardly from the edges of said front panel (12) in substantially perpendicular
relationship thereto, and a shield (16,216) comprising:


a body portion in the form of a peripheral band (24,224) of resiliently deformable
and elastically stretchable material for surrounding and elastically engaging the side

surface portions (14) of an instrument immediately adjacent to its said front panel surface
(12), said band (24,224) having a forward edge and a rearward edge;
a first inwardly extending flange (28,228) and projecting toward the center of said
peripheral band (24,224) from at least a portion of the forward edge thereof to lie in

substantially parallel, overlying relationship with the said front panel (12) of an
instrument; characterised by;
a second inwardly extending flange (32) projecting toward the center of said band
(24,224) from at least a portion of the rearward edge thereof, said second inwardly

extending flange (32) having an inner edge for frictionally engaging the adjacent side
