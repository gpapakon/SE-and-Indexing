<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clip binder for unpunched papers, having a binder spine (10), a back cover (14) moulded onto the binder spine (10) and a clip (40) capable of limited movement transversely to the binder spine (10) between a release position and a clipping position. The clip (40) has two resiliently splayable clip legs (42, 44), of which one, the rear clip leg (42), engages behind the back cover (14) and the other, front clip leg (44) can be pushed onto a retaining strip (24), which engages over the papers at the edge, with an obliquely backward projecting clip rib (46), with intermediate clipping of the papers. Provided on the retaining strip is a stop lip (28) projecting forwards from one fold edge (26), against which the clip rib (46) of the clip (40) stops in the release position. In order to guarantee reliable handling when papers are introduced into and removed from the binder, even when a relatively soft and deformable binder material is used, the projecting part of the stop lip (28) is welded to the retaining strip (24) on both sides outside the stop region of the clip rib (46), forming a laterally limited stop pocket (34).

Clip binder for unpunched papers having a binder spine 
(10), a back cover (14) whose back edge (12) is formed, 

glued or welded on the binder spine (10), optionally a 
front cover (38) whose back edge is formed, glued or 

welded in the vicinity of the binder spine (10), and a 
clip (40) which is displaceable to a limited extent at 

right angles to the binder spine (10) between a release 
position and a clamping position and comprises two 

elastically spreadable clamping limbs (42, 44), of which 
the one, rear clamping limb (42) engages behind the back 

cover (14) and the other, front clamping limb (44) with a 
clamping rib (46), which projects obliquely back towards 

the rear clamping limb (42) and the binder spine (10), 
may be pushed through a window aperture (16) in the 

binder spine (10) and/or front cover (38) onto a holding 
strip (24) overlapping the edge of the papers so as to 

clamp the paper in between and in the release position 
may strike against a stop lip (28), which is formed via a 

rear-side fold (26) on the holding strip (24), extends at 
least over part of the holding strip length and projects 

from the fold edge (26) forward into the region of the 
window aperture (16), 
characterized in that
 the 
projecting part of the stop lip (28) is fastened at both 

sides outside of the striking region of the clamping rib 
(46) to the holding strip (24) so as to form a laterally 

delimited stop pocket (34). 
Clip binder according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the projecting part of the stop lip (28) is welded, 

glued, stapled or riveted to the holding strip (24). 
Clip binder according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the projecting part of the stop lip (28) over a sub-section 
or over its entire length outside of the striking  

 
region of the clamping rib (46) is fastened pointwise or 

areally to the holding strip. 
Clip binder according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 the stop lip (28) is fastened to 
the holding strip (24) by a weld seam (30) which overlaps 

the free lip edge. 
Clip binder according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 the lateral delimitations (32) of 
the stop pocket (34) are disposed outside of the window 

aperture at a distance from the side edges of the window 
aperture (16) which corresponds at least to the lip 

width, preferably to at least twice the lip width. 
Clip binder according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 the projecting part of the stop lip 
(28) is fastened inside the striking region to the 

holding strip (24) along a lip section (36) corresponding 
to at least the lip width, preferably to at least twice 

the lip width, and that the clamping rib (46) has an 
open-edged recess (48') or opening in the region of the 

lip section (36) fastened to the holding strip (24). 
Clip binder according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 the binder spine (10) is formed via 
a rearward fold edge (12) or double fold edge (12, 18) on 

the back cover and comprises a front cover-side window 
strip (20) having the window aperture (16), and that the 

holding strip (24) carrying the stop lip (28) is formed 
via a fold edge or double fold edge (22), which is 

disposed at a distance from the rearward fold edge (12), 
on the window strip (20) and is folded in towards the 

inside of the window strip (20) facing the back cover 
(14).  

 
Clip binder according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 
the front cover (38) is welded or glued to the broad side 

of the holding strip (24) facing the back cover. 
Clip binder according to one of claims 1 to 8, 

characterized in that
 the binder spine (10) and the back 
cover (14) formed thereon are made of a semi-crystalline 

plastic material, in particular polypropylene, or of 
cardboard.
