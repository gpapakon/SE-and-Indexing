<ABSTRACT>
In an adder effecting the sum of two binary numbers A and B, it is common to associate one or more parity bits (PA, PB, PS) with the two numbers A and B and also with the result S. Each number A and B as well as the result S is split into K groups of m bits each, and one parity bit is associated with each group. One purpose of the device is to obtain the parity PS associated with the result S at the same time as the result. The incoming carry cin entering the addition is available before the start of the operations. Consequently, it is used in a first stage 10' upstream of the device which calculates intermediate variables pi,j and gi,j. The other incoming carries ci,1 corresponding to the other groups are determined only later by a circuit for anticipating the carries, consequently they are used only in a second stage 50' downstream of the device. The use of cin in the first stage 10' makes it possible to calculate the parity bits and anticipate the carries with a single circuit present in a third stage 60, intermediate between the first stage 10' and the second stage 50'.
