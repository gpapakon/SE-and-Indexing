<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layered catalyst on a metal substrate and a method for its preparation is provided. The catalyst includes a substrate (11), an adhesive sublayer (12) whose improved adhesion to the substrate is obtained by the formation of a diffusion layer (13) between the substrate and adhesive layer, a catalytically active layer (14) deposited on the adhesive sublayer characterized by a smooth compositional gradient of the catalytically active component such that the catalytically active layer ranges from substantially 0.0 wt. % at the adhesive sublayer interface to substantially 100 wt. % at the outermost portion of the catalytically active layer and a porous layer (18) containing at least the catalytically active component. An activator coating (19) can be applied to the porous layer. The catalyst is prepared by plasma spraying a thermally reactive powder onto the substrate to form the adhesive sublayer, whereby the heat generated by the thermally reactive powders causes diffusion of the sublayer into the substrate and a diffusion bonded layer is formed resulting in a strong adhesion of the sublayer to the substrate, subsequently introducing at least alumina and a second powder into a plasma torch at separately controllable variable feed rates and co-depositing alumina and the second powder, adjusting the relative feed rates of alumina and second powder into the plasma torch such that a catalytically active layer with a smooth compositional gradient is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Catalyst Composition and a Method for Its PreparationBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to a multi-layered catalyst on a metal substrate for the catalytic conversion of gases, such as the purification of exhaust gases of internal combustion engines. The present invention further relates to a method for producing a catalyst.Catalysts for the purification of waste gases from an internal combustion engine or other industrial processes typically include a thermally resistant metal substrate, an alumina interlayer and a catalytically active layer containing platinum. The catalytically active materials of the interlayer and catalytically active layer purify exhaust gases such as CO, CHX and NOx. In known catalysts, delamination of the coating from the substrate is a common source of failure. Stronger bonding of the alumina interlayer to the substrate is possible if an adhesive sublayer, which contains an element also found in the substrate, is deposited between the two layers. However, at the high service temperatures typically encountered in an internal combustion engine, the catalytically active layer is susceptible to failure at the sublayer/active layer interface.Metal-ceramic interfaces are weak points in the composite. Dissimilar materials are sites for mechanical stress concentrations and often nucleate the failure process. Mechanical properties of the interface often control the overall function of the coated catalyst. Therefore, improving the mechanical properties of the interface can result in a prolonged life for the entire article.Known catalysts still need a relatively large amount of noble metals to achieve sufficiently high conversions of CO, CHX and NOx. In 1989, Europe consumed 26 tons of platinum, most of which was used by the automobile industry in catalytic converters. Since metals of the platinum group are expensive and limited in resources, it is desirable toSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

reduce the noble metal content of the catalyst without sacrificing catalytic efficiency.It is the object of the present invention to provide a catalyst with a strong bond to the metal substrate which is stable to thermal and mechanical shocks. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a catalyst with improved catalytic activity while reducing the noble metal content in the active layer.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing a catalyst with improved thermal and mechanical stability and enhanced catalytic activity.Summary of the
