<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material, more particularly to a 
high-speed silver halide photographic light-sensitive material 
wherein sensitivity fluctuation caused by long term storage of 
a raw product has been improved. Heretofore, demand for a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material has been severe year by year. In 
addition to the demand for the enhancement of sensitivity and 
of high image quality (especially excellent graininess and 
sharpness), processing compatibility with low replenishment to 
reduce environmental pollution and rapid processing property 
for finishing in a short time. Most of these demands can be 
solved by attaining enhancement of sensitivity of silver 
halide grains. It is no exaggeration to say that the  
 
enhancement of the sensitivity of silver halide grains is the 
most important theme in this industry. With regard to the enhancement of the sensitivity of 
silver halide grains, many studies have been conducted for a 
long time. More concretely, there are methods of chemical 
sensitization and spectral sensitization. Methods described 
below are known. As a method for enhancing sensitivity by means of 
chemical sensitization, chemical sensitization methods such as 
an independent use or combination use of sulfur sensitization, 
noble metal sesitization (for example, gold sensitization, 
paradium sensitization, platinum sensitization, irridium 
sensitization and selenium sensitization are cited) reduction 
sensitization are known. In addition, for example, methods to use as a spectral 
sensitization dye used in spectral sensitization, cyanine dyes 
such as a zeromethine dye, a monomethine dye, a dimethine dye, 
a trimethine dye and a merocyanine dye independently or in 
combination (for example, super sensitization) are known. The above-mentioned technologies are described also in 
USP. Nos. 2,688,545, 2,912,329, 3,397,060, 3,615,635 and 
3,628,964, British Patent Nos. 1,195,302, 1,242,588 and 
1,293,862, German Patent (OLS) Nos. 2,030,326 and 2,121,780 
and Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 4936/1968 and 14030/1969. Of the above-mentioned technologies, in a practical 
light-sensitive material, especially in a color light-sensitive  
 
material, a technology of spectral sensitization in 
which silver halides having a specific sensitivity to a blue 
light are sensitized by a green light or a red light is 
essential. One method for obtaining a high sensitivity by means of 
spectral sensitization is to select an
