<ABSTRACT>
A water dispersible solid formulation comprising an 
active ingredient, a surfactant of non-ionic type, a 

surfactant of anionic type and at least 30 wt% of urea is 
disclosed. A process of preparing the formulation and the 

use of the formulation for delivering an active 
ingredient, for example a pesticide or plant growth 

regulant to an agricultural or horticultural locus are 
also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water dispersible solid formulation
comprising triazamate.Crop protection agents are formulated in solid or
liquid compositions, usually in the form of a concentrate
for ease of handling and transportation, which are diluted
with water by the user before application.Since unsophisticated mixing techniques are often
used for diluting solid formulations, one important
requirement for such formulations is that of rapid
dispersal in water. If a solid formulation does not
disperse rapidly, clogging of spray equipment with
undispersed formulation may occur and, furthermore, there
may be inadequate application of active ingredient to the
crop to be treated.Many known processes for the preparation of solid
crop protection formulations require the active ingredient
to be premilled to a fine particle size and/or require a
drying step, in order to remove water and form a solid.
Such process steps add to the inefficiency of the overall
process.The patent literature discloses many solid crop
protection formulations. For example,
EP-A-0 501 798 discloses a water-dispersible composition
comprising urea, a surfactant of a non-ionic type, a
surfactant of an anionic type and Diuron as an active agent.U.S. Patent No. 3
274 052 (FMC) discloses a process for the preparation of
pesticide granules which comprises the step of coating the
surface of granular carrier particles with an active
ingredient. The granular carrier particles may be any
water-insoluble or water soluble, porous or non-porous 
material. Examples of water soluble materials disclosed
include fertilisers such as ammonium phosphate, ammonium
sulphate, urea, muriate of potash and super-phosphate.French Patent Application No. 2 645 709 (Sumitomo)
discloses a process for the preparation of an emulsifiable
solid pesticidal composition which comprises melting a
pesticide and a water soluble polymer, for example,
polyethylene glycol, a surfactant, a solvent and/or a
water soluble support. Examples of water soluble supports
disclosed include hydropropylcellulose, urea, lactose and
ammonium sulphate.PCT Patent Application Number WO 91/13546 (DuPont)
discloses water-dispersible or water-soluble pesticide
granules which comprise 5% to 95% of pesticidal particles
in combination with 5% to 40% of a water-soluble heat
activated binder (HAB). Examples of HABs disclosed include
ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and
polyethoxylated dinonylphenol. The HABs may also include
up to 50% co-binders such as polyethylene glycols,
polyethylene
