<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector includes a dielectric 
housing (22) having a terminal-receiving passageway (24) 

having a latch shoulder (30) therewithin. A terminal (10) 
is insertable into the passageway and includes a latch arm 

(20) for latching behind the latch shoulder to prevent 
removal of the terminal from the passageway. The latch arm 

(20) is permanently deformable from a first, insertion 
position to permit insertion of the terminal into the 

passageway and a second, latching position transversely of 
the first position into engagement with the latch shoulder 

(30) to prevent removal of the terminal (10) from the 
passageway (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector according
to the preamble of claims 1, 7 and 12 as well as to a method
of assembling such an electrical connector according to
claim 9.A wide variety of electrical connectors include dielectric
housings within which are secured a plurality of metallic
contact terminals by mechanical means. A number of years
ago, terminals usually were retained within connector
housings by molding the housing around the terminals,
potting the terminals within the housing or force fitting
the terminals in passageways for permanent retention. With
the development of more sophisticated electronics, and with
the ever-increasing miniaturization of electrical circuitry,
small terminals most often have been stamped and formed from
thin sheet metal material, with the terminals including
locking lances or fingers which protrude at an appropriate
angle laterally to engage behind stop surfaces within the
housing passageway to secure the terminals against
withdrawal. The locking fingers are resilient and deflect
inwardly toward the terminal during insertion of the
terminal into a passageway in the connector housing, and
then the locking fingers spring back and engage behind the
stop surfaces.Another typical terminal retention means employs locking
fingers on the plastic housing extending into the terminal-receiving
passageway. The locking fingers on the housing
initially are deflected by the terminal during insertion and
then spring back and engage behind stop surface means on the
terminal upon full insertion.Problems have been encountered in using terminal retention 
means or systems which incorporate resilient locking fingers
either on the terminals or in the housing passageways, when
those systems are used in high vibration applications or
environments. Automotive applications are but one example.
In particular, the locking fingers inherently have a degree
of play or looseness in relation to their stop surfaces,
whether the locking fingers are on the terminals or on the
inside of the housing passageways. This play simply occurs
because of normal manufacturing tolerances. It would be
substantially cost prohibitive to manufacture such terminals
and/or housings with sufficiently close tolerances to
eliminate the play or looseness in the terminals. In
vibrating applications, the looseness can become greater
because of the vibrations involved. In addition, the
vibrations can cause a "rattling" affect which is highly
undesirable in automotive applications.US-A-3 500 299 avoids these
