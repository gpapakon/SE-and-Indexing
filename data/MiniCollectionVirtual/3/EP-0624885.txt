<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a cable intended to be used in the telecommunications field, having a coaxial structure consisting of a metal core (3) surrounded by at least two layers of which one is a layer (2) of dielectric material, characterised in that the other layer (1), placed between the said core (3) and the said layer (2) of dielectric material over at least part of the length of the cable, is a layer of semiconductor composite material comprising an insulating matrix and a non-doped conductive polymer having conjugated bonds, the said cable thus becoming a cable which intrinsically filters the electromagnetic interference which it conducts in the range of frequencies below 1 GHz.

Coaxial telecommunications cable comprising a metal 
core surrounded by at least two layers one of which is a 

dielectric material layer, characterised in that the other 
layer, disposed between said core and said dielectric material 

layer over at least part of the length of the cable, is a 
semiconductor composite material layer comprising an 

insulative matrix and an undoped conductive polymer containing 
conjugated bonds, said cable thereby constituting a cable with 

intrinsic filtering of electromagnetic interference conducted 
by the cable at frequencies below 1 GHz. 
Cable according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said polymer is selected from an electronic conductive 

polymer, an ionic conductive polymer, a zwitterionic 
conductive polymer and a ferromagnetic polymer. 
Cable according to claim 2 characterised in that 
said electronic conductive polymer is selected from polymers 

and copolymers based on aniline, thiophene, pyrole, fullerene, 
phenylene-vinylene, phenylene-sulphide, isothionaphthene and 

derivatives thereof. 
Cable according to claim 2 characterised in that 
said zwitterionic conductive polymer is selected from polymers 

and copolymers based on sulphobetaine and its derivatives. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the proportion of said polymer exceeds 

5% by volume of the composite material. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said composite material further contains 

a conductive additive selected from a doped or self-doped 
conductive polymer, a carbon black loading and a metal 

loading, said additive being present in proportions of less 
than 10% by volume of said composite material. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the thickness of said composite material 

layer is between 0.1 times and twice the thickness of said  
 

dielectric material layer. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said core is surrounded by a plurality 

of layers of composite materials having different composition 
and/or thickness, said composite material layers being covered 

with at least one dielectric material layer. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said electromagnetic interference is 

absorbed in a frequency band which depends on the nature of 
said polymer. 
Cable according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said electromagnetic interference is 

absorbed in a frequency band which depends on the thickness of 
said composite material layer. 
Application to the field of telecommunications of a 
cable as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
