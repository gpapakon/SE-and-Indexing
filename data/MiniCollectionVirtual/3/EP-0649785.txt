<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sail reefing system comprising a mast, a mainsail and a boom with a furler. The mast comprises a longitudinal rail (11) equipped with a longitudinal groove (13) arranged to receive a rope of a mainsail mounted on said mast. The rail supports one or more sliding carriages (12) equipped with two lateral plates (22) and with a fixing pin (23) making it possible to fasten a head of said mainsail. The longitudinal rail (11) is mounted on the mast and is fixed by mechanical fixing means (24). This device is suitable in particular for mounting on a large sailboat equipped with automatic means for furling the mainsail on the boom because it makes it possible to reduce the diameter of the rope, thus facilitating furling of the sail.
