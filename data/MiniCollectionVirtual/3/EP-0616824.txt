Filter support for stacking into a filter tower, with a 
filter chamber defined by a bottom (2) and a side wall (3) 

for receiving a filter cake, with a pressure plate (7) 
which is formed on the bottom and which, when several 

filter supports are stacked one on top of the other, at 
least partially engages in the filter chamber underneath 

for pressing the filter cake formed there, with at least 
one distributor element (8) located under the pressure 

plate for unfiltered material and with a seal for sealing 
between the pressure plate (7) and the side wall (3) of the 

filter support underneath, characterised in that the seal 
(12) comprises a sealing edge (15) for sealing between the 

pressure plate (7) and the side wall (3) of the filter 
support (1) underneath and a sealing collar (17) for 

sealing and retaining the distributor element (8) on the 
pressure plate (7). 
Filter support according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the seal (12) is held latched to the pressure plate 

(7). 
Filter support according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the seal (12) is constructed as a peripheral 

sealing ring. 
Filter support according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the sealing ring is made of an impact-resistant, 

creep-resistant plastic such as e.g. a polyamide made by 
lactam pouring. 
Filter support according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the sealing edge (15) and the 

sealing collar (17) are constructed with initial tension. 
Filter support according to one or more of claims 3 to  
 

5, characterised in that to latch the sealing ring (12) to 
the pressure plate (7), on the sealing ring (12) is 

provided a peripheral latching collar (13). 
Filter support according to claim 6, characterised in 
that on the pressure plate (7) is formed an approach ramp 

(19) for the latching collar (13). 
Filter support according to one or more of claims 3 to 
7, characterised in that in the sealing ring (12) 

distributed over the circumference are formed through-openings 
(20) for the unfiltered material. 
Filter support according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that on the bottom (2) opposite 

the seal (12) is provided a receiving groove (21) for a 
peripheral outer seal (22). 
Filter support according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer edge of 

the side wall at least on the filter chamber side is 
provided with a slope (24) for centring the sealing ring 

(12). 
Filter support according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the sealing edge 

(15) is arranged on the seal (12) opposite the sealing 
collar (point S). 
Filter support according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the sealing edge 

(15) is formed by a lip ring (16) which ensures sufficient 
resilience in spite of the high modulus of elasticity of 

the basic material (polyamide).
