 NOVEL MEDICAMENTFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel medica¬ ments containing GLP-l(7-37) , GLP-1(7-36)amide or analogues or functional derivatives thereof and a phospholipid, and to a method for preparing such medicaments.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONGlucagon-li e peptide-1, also referred to as GLP-1, is a peptide sequence found in the C-terminal portion of mammalian proglucagon. Prior to 1985, no definite bio¬ logical activity of GLP-1 had been reported. However, in 1985 it was demonstrated that GLP-1(1-36)amide, like gluca- gon, stimulates insulin release from isolated precultured rat pancreatic islets in the presence of glucose in a dose- dependent manner (Schmidt, .E. et al. Diabetolo ia 28 (1985) 704-7) . This finding suggests that GLP-1(1-36) amide and related peptides might be useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Due to its substantially closer sequence homology to glucagon and glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide, also referred to as GIP, Schmidt et al. suggested that an even stronger glucagon- and/or GIP-like biological activity could be expected with GLP-l(7-36) than with the intact peptide. In recent years, particular interest has focused on the GLP-1 fragments GLP-l(7-37) and GLP-1(7- 36)amide and analogues and functional derivatives thereof. The amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-36) amide and GLP-1(7-37) is given in formula I:His-Ala-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser- Ser-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe- Ile-Ala-Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-Gly-Arg-X(I) 

which shows GLP-l(7-36)amide when X is NH2 and GLP-l(7-37) when X is Gly-OH.Thus, International Patent Application No. WO87/06941 (to The General Hospital Corporation) relates to a peptide fragment which comprises GLP-l(7-37) and functional derivatives thereof and to its use as an insulinotropic agent. International Patent Application No.90/11296 (to The General Hospital Corporation) relates to a peptide fragment which comprises GLP-l(7-36) and functional derivatives thereof and has an insulinotropic activity which exceeds the insulinotropic activity of GLP-l(l-36) or GLP-1(1-37) and to its use as an insulinotropic agent.International Patent Application No. 91/11457(to Buckley et al. ) relates to effective analogues of the active GLP-1 peptides 7-34, 7-35, 7-36, and 7-37.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is based on the fact that when GLP-1 related peptides are administered in a formula¬ tion comprising certain phospholipids, a very favourable absorption profile is found. Also, the phospholipids
