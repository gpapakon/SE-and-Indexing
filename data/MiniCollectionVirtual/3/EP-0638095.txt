<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a fluoropolymer is disclosed. The process comprises solubilizing a fluoromonomer in solvent comprising a carbon dioxide fluid, and then polymerizing the fluoromonomer to produce the fluoropolymer. A preferred solvent for carrying out the process is supercritical carbon dioxide; preferred fluoromonomers for carrying out the process are fluoroacrylate monomers such as 1,1-dihydroperfluorooctyl acrylate. The polymerization step is preferably carried out in the presence of an initiator such as azobisisobutyronitrile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
making fluoropolymers, including copolymers thereof,
in a solvent comprising a carbon dioxide fluid such as
supercritical carbon dioxide.Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been identified
as one of the main causes of the depletion of
atmospheric ozone. As a result, extensive effort has
been directed towards discovering alternatives to CFCs
in a variety of applications. In addition to the
utilization of CFCs as refrigerants and aerosols, CFCs
are commonly used as solvents for the manufacture of
fluoropolymers, which are generally insoluble in
traditional organic solvents but can often be
solubilized in CFCs. Hence, there is a need for
alternative methods of manufacturing fluoropolymers. A supercritical fluid (SCF) is a substance
above its critical temperature and critical pressure
(or "critical point"). Compressing a gas normally
causes a phase separation and the appearance of a
separate liquid phase. However, if the fluid is in a
supercritical state, compression will only result in
density increases: no liquid phase will be formed. The
physical properties of supercritical fluids are highly
unpredictable, and the use of supercritical fluids for
carrying out polymerization processes has received
relatively little attention.S. Kumar et al., Polym. Prep.27, 224 (1986),
describe the free radical precipitation polymerization
of polystyrene chains in supercritical ethane. The
styrene monomers were dissolved in ethane and
polymerized with azobisisobutyronitrile ("AIBN") as an
initiator using an apparatus having a high-pressure
optical cell.V. Sarai and E. Kiran, Polym. Prep.31, 687
(1990), describe the free radical polymerization of
styrene in supercritical ethane, propane, and butane,
using AIBN, t-butyl peroxide and t-butyl peroxybenzoate
as initiators.K. Scholsky, Polym. Prep.31, 685 (1990),
describe a variety of polymerization reactions using
supercritical fluids. The article summarizes
publications on the polymerization of fluorinated
olefins, such as vinyl fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene,
the copolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene and sulfur
dioxide, and polyperfluoropropylene. Other fluorinated
olefins mentioned include n-tetradecafluoroheptene-1,
n-perfluoropentadiene-1,4, vinylidene chlorofluoride,
and a variety of vinylic monomers. The polymerization
of fluoropolymers in carbon dioxide is not suggested.E. Beckman and R. Smith, J. Phys. Chem.94,
345 (1990) describe the microemulsion polymerization of
acrylamide (CH2CHCONH2) in supercritical fluids, and
