<ABSTRACT>
Video images of varying resolutions are derived from one video signal 
(VIDIN) with high bandwidth efficiency by employing a new two-layer video coding 

technique using spatial scalability in which the prediction taken from one layer 
(1140) is combined with the prediction taken from the other layer (1180), and the 

combined prediction is used to code one of the layers (in 1180). In an illustrative 

example of the invention employing a base-layer and an enhancement-layer, the 
spatially interpolated base-layer (on 1170) is combined, by the selection of 

appropriate weights, with the motion compensated temporal prediction of the 
enhancement layer to generate the prediction used to encode the enhancement-layer 

(in 1180). Weights are selected based on a calculation of the sum of the absolute 
differences, or the sum of the squares of the differences between the prediction and 

reference macroblocks to produce the prediction giving the best bandwidth 
efficiency. This weighting process is called spatio-temporal weighting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to encoding and decoding of video signals and, more 
particularly, to efficient encoding of video signals in a scalable manner which permits 
video images to be decoded in a variety of resolution scales and picture formats. Worldwide efforts are underway to improve the quality of video signal production, 
transmission, and reproduction because a great deal of commercial importance is being 
predicted for improved quality video systems. These efforts involve, at least in part, 
increasing the resolution with which images are converted into representative electrical 
signals, typically in the form of digital bit-streams, by increasing the spatial and temporal 
sampling rates that are used to convert video images into electrical signals. This increase in 
resolution consequently means that more data about images must be produced, processed, 
and transmitted in a given time interval. Video images, such as those images in the field of a television camera, are scanned 
at a predetermined rate and converted into a series of electrical signals, each electrical 
signal representing a characteristic of a predetermined region of the image generally known 
as a picture element, pel, or pixel. Picture elements are typically grouped into macroblocks 
for most video signal processing purposes where each macroblock consists of a 16 by 16 
array of picture elements. A plurality of macroblocks taken together at a predetermined 
instant in time forms what amounts to a still picture (i.e., a frame) representing the nature 
of the image at the predetermined instant of time. Increasing the quality of video signals 
produced in this manner involves, at least in part, the use of larger number of smaller-size 
picture elements to represent a given image frame and the production of a larger number of 
image frames per unit time. As the number of pels for each video image increases and the rate at which images 
are produced increases, there is an increasing amount of video data which must produced, 
transmitted, received and processed in a given time interval. A number of video 
compression schemes have been proposed which attempt to transmit higher quality video 
images using the same number of bits and the same bit rates used for lower quality images. 
The Motion Pictures Expert Group Phase 1 (MPEG-1) standard provides a particular 
syntax and decoding process for one such scheme. This standard is set forth in International  
 
Standards Organization (ISO) Committee Draft 11172-2, "Coding of Moving
