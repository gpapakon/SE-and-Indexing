<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an animal leash which can be guided as required in either hand and in the case of which the operating means for the permanent-stop switch (5) can be quickly reached by the hand guiding the animal leash or by the fingers of said hand, the operating means (6) are arranged at at least two regions of the housing (2) which are within access of the hand guiding the housing (2), it being possible to achieve the desired function of the permanent-stop switch (5) by optional actuation of in each case only one of the operating means (6). This thus provides an animal leash which, if need be, permits, due to the ergonomic arrangement of the required operating means, rapid and reliable reaction to specific unexpected situations in which the animal finds itself when being taken for a walk.

Windable and unwindable leash for leading animals, the 
leash (10) being arranged in a housing which can be held 

in, and guided by, a hand, the housing comprising a brake 
(3) which may be operated by said same hand to stop the 

portion of the leash located outside the housing at a 
desired length, a permanent stop-switch (5) for stopping 

the leash in the position momentarily determined by the 
brake (3) being associated with the leash in the region 

of the brake and comprising operating means (6) which are 
disposed spaced from a brake (3) activation device, 


characterized in that
 the operating means (6) are 
arranged in at least two areas of the housing accessible 

by the guiding hand, the desired function of the 
permanent stop-switch being achievable by the selective 

operation of only one of the operating means (6). 
Animal leash according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the operating means (6) are formed as pivot levers (7), 

which are disposed opposite one another and interactively 
connected together by a shaft (8) passing through the 

housing (2). 
Animal leash according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the shaft (8) is functionally associated with the brake 

(3), whereby after operation of the brake (3) the latter 
can be positively locked by the shaft (7) after corresponding 

action on one of the pivot levers (7). 
Animal leash according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 
the positive locking of brake (3) and shaft (7) is 

effected by a pivotal or rotational movement of the shaft 
(8), whereby a recess (9), which is provided in the shaft  

 
(8) to allow the passage of a peg (17) of the brake (3), 

moves out of the region of the peg (17) and the shaft (8) 
locks the peg (17). 
Animal leash according to one of claims 2 to 4, 

characterized in that
 a first pivot lever (7) is a 
component of the shaft (8), while the second pivot lever 

(7) can be connected to the free end of the shaft (8). 
Animal leash according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 
the connection between the free end of the shaft (8) and 

the second pivot lever (7) is formed as a snap 
connection. 
Animal leash according to one of claims 2 to 6, 

characterized in that
 the shaft (8) comprises a spring 
element (13) which holds the permanent stop-switch (5) in 

the respective end position. 
Animal leash according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the operating means (5) of the permanent stop-switch are 

formed as a rocker switches (14), whereby a projection-like 
element (16) of the rocker switches (14) engage 

positively with recesses (11) of the brake (3) to block 
the brake (3). 
Animal leash according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 
the rocker switches (14) are associated with one another 

by means of positively interlocking elements. 
Animal leash according to claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in 
that
 the rocking switches (14) are associated with one 
another by means of cog wheel segments.
