<ABSTRACT>
A solid-state laser device is described comprising a resonator 
body (1), an irradiating lamp (3) installed in the cavity of 

the resonator body (1), and a laser medium (4) also installed 
in the cavity. The laser medium (4) is excited by the light 

from the irradiating lamp (3). The inner wall surface (2) of 
the cavity is a rough surface for
 reflecting the light 
emanating from the irradiating lamp (3). The maximum height of 

the rough surface is in excess of 3 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
A solid-state laser device using a laser medium such as a 
YAG laser or glass laser has a reflective cylinder in which an 
irradiating lamp is made to irradiate light. The light is 
reflected by the internal wall surface of the reflective 
cylinder and caused to fall as irradiating light on the laser 
medium, thus inducing laser oscillation. The inner surface 
of the reflective cylinder assumes the form of an ellipse in a 
cross section taken perpendicular to the direction of axis. 
It is common practice to fabricate the inner wall surface out 
of a specular metal surface. In this structure, the laser 
medium and the irradiating lamp are disposed at the foci of 
the ellipse to enhance the efficiency of light collected onto 
the laser medium. In the structure described above, the reflecting surface 
is elliptical in cross section, and the irradiating light is 
focused at the foci of the ellipse. Therefore, the central 
portion of the laser medium is strongly excited but the outer 
portion of the medium is not sufficiently excited. 
Consequently, it has been pointed out that the laser 
excitation intensity has a nonuniform distribution. Also, in the above-described structure, a part of 
irradiating light emitted by the irradiating lamp which is  
 
radiated opposite direction of the laser medium cannot reach 
the laser medium because of specular reflection. It has been 
pointed out, therefore, that the excitation efficiency is 
lowered. Furthermore, in the structure described above, if only one 
irradiating lamp is used, then it is only necessary that the 
cross section assume the form of a simple ellipse. However, 
if two irradiating lamps are employed, then a double 
elliptical shape must be fabricated. If more irradiating 
lamps are used, a multiple elliptical structure corresponding 
to the number of the lamps must be built. This complicates the 
machining of the reflective cylinder. In addition, the 
irradiating efficiency is deteriorated as the multiplicity is 
increased. A technique proposed as a solution to these problems is to 
fabricate the reflective cylinder either from compacted 
powdered magnesium oxide or barium sulfate or from a diffusive 
reflector such as a ceramic so as to make the excitation 
uniform. For example, in the techniques described in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 21873/1993, microscopic 
irregularities of 0.4S (S is defined in "3.4.2 the standard 
number sequence of maximum height" of JIS (Japanese 
Industrial Standards) B0601 or more (that means fiver) are
