<ABSTRACT>
A prescan process for a MR fast spin echo (FSE) 
pulse sequence (Fig. 2) adjusts the phases of the RF 

excitation pulse and RF refocusing pulses and the value 
of the readout gradient dephaser pulse to reduce zero 

order phase shifts along all axes and first order phase 
shifts along the slice select and readout gradient axes 

due to eddy currents. Another aspect of the invention 
is the calculation during the prescan of adjustments to 

receiver phase and adjustments to readout gradients 
which further reduce image artifacts due to phase errors 

produced during the FSE scan.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is nuclear magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) methods and systems. More
particularly, the invention relates to the compensation
of fast spin echo pulse sequences to reduce image
artifacts caused by eddy currents.When a substance such as human tissue is subjected
to a uniform magnetic field (polarizing field B0), the
individual magnetic moments of the spins in the tissue
attempt to align with this polarizing field, but precess
about it in random order at their characteristic Larmor
frequency. If the substance, or tissue, is subjected to
a magnetic field (excitation field B1) which is in the
x-y plane and which is near the Larmor frequency, the
net aligned moment, Mz, may be rotated, or "tipped",
into the x-y plane to produce a net transverse magnetic
moment Mt. A signal is emitted by the excited spins
after the excitation signal B1 is terminated and this
"MR" signal may be received and processed to form an
image.When utilizing these signals to produce images,
magnetic field gradients (Gx Gy and Gz) are employed.
Typically, the region to be imaged is scanned by a
sequence of measurement cycles in which these gradients
vary according to the particular localization method
being used. The resulting set of received MR signals
are digitized and processed to reconstruct the image
using one of many well known reconstruction techniques.Most MR scans currently used to produce medical
images require many minutes to acquire the necessary
data. The reduction of this scan time is an important
consideration, since reduced scan time increases patient
throughput, improves patient comfort, and improves image
quality by reducing motion artifacts. There is a class
of pulse sequences which have a very short repetition 
time (TR) and result in complete scans which can be
conducted in seconds rather than minutes.
One of these is the Rapid Acquisition Relaxation
Enhanced (RARE) sequence which is described by J. Hennig
et al in an article in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
3,823-833 (1986) entitled "RARE Imaging: A Fast Imaging
Method for Clinical MR." The RARE sequence is a fast
spin echo sequence which utilizes RF refocused echoes
generated from a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence.
Such fast spin echo ("FSE") scans are very susceptible
to image artifacts caused by eddy currents induced by
the rapidly changing magnetic field gradients. While
gradient pulse compensation techniques are adequate for
scans performed with most MRI pulse sequences, it has
been discovered that observable image artifacts are
pro

<CLAIMS>
A method of adjusting a fast spin echo pulse sequence
used in a magnetic resonance imaging system which performs a

scan to acquire MR data in which an RF magnetic field is produced by an
RF excitation pulse followed by a series of RF refocusing pulses and

magnetic field gradients comprising readout gradients along a readout axis
to spatially encode echo signals that are acquired during the fast spin echo

pulse sequence, the method comprising performing a prescan with the steps of:

a) acquiring MR data using the fast spin echo pulse sequence;
b) calculating a phase profile, being the phases of the respective
spin echo signal along the readout axis, for each of two echo

signals in the acquired MR data;
c) adjusting the relative phase of the RF excitation pulse and an RF
refocusing pulse in the fast spin echo pulse sequence to reduce

the magnitude of a phase difference value between the two phase
profiles; and
d) repeating steps a, b and c until the magnitude of the phase
difference value is less than a preset amount.
The method as recited in claim 1 which further includes:

e) adjusting the value of a readout gradient dephaser pulse in the

fast spin echo pulse sequence to reduce the difference in slope of
the two phase profiles the readout gradient dephases pulse being applied before the echo signals are acquired; and
f) repeating steps a, b and e until the difference in slope of the two
phase profiles is less than a preset amount.
The method as recited in claim 1 in which the magnetic field
gradients produced by the fast spin echo pulse sequence during the scan

include a readout magnetic field gradient produced during the acquisition 
of each echo signal, and a phase encoding gradient produced prior to each

echo signal, and the phase encoding gradient is not produced during step a
of the prescan.
The method as recited in claim 1 in which the magnetic field
gradients produced by the fast spin echo pulse sequence during the scan

include a readout magnetic field gradient produced during the acquisition
of each echo signal, and a phase encoding gradient produced prior to each

echo signal, and the phase encoding gradient is produced during step a of
the prescan such that one of said two echo signal phase profiles is phase

encoded and the other phase profile is not phase encoded.
The method as recited in claim 1 in which a set of fast spin echo
pulse sequences are employed to acquire a corresponding set of images

during the scan, and steps a, b, c and d are performed using each fast
spin echo pulse sequence in said set.
The method as recited in claim 1 which further includes:

g) acquiring MR data using the fast spin echo pulse sequence;
h) calculating a phase profile for each echo signal produced by the
spin echo pulse sequence; and
i) calculating a receiver phase shift for each echo signal from its
corresponding phase profile;

said receiver phase shifts being used during the scan to adjust a reference
phase of a receiver within a transceiver module during the acquisition of each echo signal with said receiver.
The method as recited in claim 6 which further includes:

j) calculating an adjustment to a readout gradient associated with
each echo signal from the slope of its corresponding phase profile, thus

changing the slope of each phase profile to a
common reference value.
