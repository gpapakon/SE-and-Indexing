<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a suspension of discrete composite particles is described. Each composite particle comprising an insoluble first particle and at least one insoluble second particle on the surface of the first particle. The process comprises mixing the first particles with the second particles under conditions to form a suspension free of agglomerate comprising multiple first particles and agglomerate consisting of just multiple second particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for particle adsorption. In
particular, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a composite
particle wherein at least one second particle is adsorbed on the surface of a first
particle. The present invention also relates to a suspension of the composite
particles.Generally, the present invention relates to a process for preparing aqueous
compositions including inorganic material particles, such as TiO2 and/or clay
particles. More particularly, the present invention relates to the dispersion and
distribution of inorganic material particles in products formed by the loss of
water from such aqueous compositions.Aqueous dispersions of polymeric latex are used to prepare a tremendous
variety of commercially important products, including paints, coatings, primers,
mastics, caulks, binders for non-woven materials, and adhesives. Frequently, the
polymeric latex is included to form a continuous phase as the water is lost in
order to bind the product together, and to contribute important physical
properties. In addition to the polymeric latex, most products include particles of
one or more inorganic materials. Some inorganic materials contribute an
important functional property to the product, such as fire resistance, sheen,
flatting, hardness, color, texture, opacity, or toughness. Often these inorganic
materials are relatively expensive, and it is desirable to employ them in the
formulated product as efficiently as posssible.For example, titanium dioxide has been for many years the pigment of
choice for conferring opacity to plastic sheets and films, and particularly to
coatings formed from coating compositions and paints. In paints titanium
dioxide is typically the most expensive component of the formulation on a
volume basis. It has been an ongoing objective of the coatings industry to
achieve the desired degree of opacity in a coating while at the same time using as
little titanium dioxide pigment as possible. One way in which this is done is by 
employing titanium dioxide which has an optimal average particle size and
particle size distribution for scattering light. Another way of making efficient use
of the titanium dioxide employed is by dispersing this pigment as well as
possible.Agglomerated or aggregated titanium dioxide pigment particles make less
than their full potential contribution to the performance of the coatings, such as,
for example, with regard to coating opacity and colorant potential. Such
aggregates can also impair certain other
