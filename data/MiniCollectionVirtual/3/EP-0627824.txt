<ABSTRACT>
A point to point communication apparatus, such as a digital 
radiopager (RP), in which a non-volatile electrically programmable 

store for example a radio identification code (RIC) or 
configuration store (32) is programmed/reprogrammed by sending 

coded light signals to a light sensor (50). The coded 
programming/reprogramming light signals from an external source 

(54), such as a personal computer, conform to a protocol which on 
being recognised causes a controller (22) to permit access to the 

RIC or configuration store (32). The light sensor (50) may also be 
used to sense the ambient light for controlling the energisation of 

a back light (48) of a LCD panel (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to programming and/or 
reprogramming data stored in a point to point communication 
apparatus, particularly a portable communication apparatus, such 
as a radiopager, and to the combination of a programming apparatus 
and a point to point communication apparatus. It is customary to program, reprogram or read a program store 
coupled to a microcontroller in a portable point to point radio 
apparatus, such as a radiopager, either by means of electrical 
contacts provided in the pager, for example in the battery 
compartment, or by over-air messages carrying a special 
identification which causes the processor to permit access to the 
RIC or configuration store. The use of electrical contacts has the 
disadvantages of reliability due to wear and contamination, cost of 
supply and fitting and the need to partially disassemble the 
equipment to gain access to them. Over air programming or 
reprogramming requires the provision of a pre-programmed default 
condition and special radio identification code (RIC). This 
technique has a disadvantage that, due to falsing on error 
correction of a message, an equipment can be reprogrammed 
accidentally or incorrectly. An object of the present invention is to program or reprogram 
a point to point communications apparatus in a reliable but cost 
effective manner. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided 
a point to point communication apparatus comprising radio receiving 
means, signal decoding means coupled to the radio receiving means, 
processing means for controlling the operation of the radio receiving 
means and the decoding means, a program memory coupled to the 
processing means, an electrically programmable store coupled to the 
processing means, optical radiation sensing means coupled to the 
processing means for providing an electrical version of received 
optical radiation, the processing means in response to recognising  
 
electrical versions of coded optical radiation signals received by 
the sensing means, causing said electrically programmable store to 
be programmed or reprogrammed. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a combination of a programming apparatus and a point to 
point communication apparatus, the programming apparatus comprising 
a controller, means for inputting program data coupled to the 
controller, an optical radiation emitting device and means coupled 
to the controller and the optical radiation emitting device for 
providing a version of
