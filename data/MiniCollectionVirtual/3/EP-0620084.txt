<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping device for clamping workpieces on machine tables, apparatus or pallets with a hydraulically or pneumatically actuated clamping force-holding element (14) in which the holding force is produced via holding elements (14). The clamping device and the clamping force-holding element (14) are combined, either in a housing (1) or in the case of separate housings are interconnected. The clamping piston (3) of the clamping device and the adjusting piston (6,7) of the holding element (14) are situated, however, approximately perpendicular to one another. The clamping piston (3) is connected in the lower part fixedly to a push rod (4) which terminates in the shape of a wedge (5). The holding element (14) has two pistons (6,7), between which a piston rod (8) is arranged. The piston rod (8) is likewise formed in the shape of a wedge in the region (15) below the push rod (4), so that both wedge faces (10,11) slide on one another. In addition, a wedge groove (10) is formed in the piston rod. The push rod (4) is provided in the region of its wedge face (15) with a wedge bevel (11) adapted to the wedge groove (10). If the piston rod (8) slides under the push rod (4), the push rod (4) penetrates by way of its wedge bevel (11) into the wedge groove (10) of the piston rod (8), thus resulting in a large friction area between these elements.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping device for clamping workpieces on machining tables or pallets with a 
hydraulically or pneumatically operated clamping-force holding element wherein the 

holding force is generated via holding elements provided with tapered surfaces sliding on 
each other and wherein the clam
ping piston (3) of the clamping device and the adjusting 
pistons (6, 7) of said clamping-force holding element are disposed in an approximately 

orthogonal arrangement relative to each other, 
characterised in
 that the piston rod (8) 
of said adjusting piston presents a cuneate configuration along one portion (15), and that 

a spline (10) is machined into said cuneate portion (15) of the piston rod (8), and that the 
ram (4) of said clamping piston (3) is provided with tapered slopes (11) on either side in 

the region of its tapered surface (5) over the length of said tapered surface (5), which tapered 
slopes are appropriate conformed to the lateral surfaces of said spline (10). 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that said piston rod (8) 
is configured as splined gearing system over said portion (15), and that said ram (4) is 

equally provided with a splined gearing, and that said splined gearings on said piston rod 
and on said ram slide in each other in a form-locking manner. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in
 that the self-self-locking 
action of said piston rod (8) and said ram (4) may be determined by the inclination 

of said tapered surfaces (5 and 9) together with said tapered slope (11). 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that a cylindrical sliding 
pin (19) is rigidly connected to the housing (1), on which pin a tapered piston (16) provided 

with a cylinder bore (17) is disposed for sliding, and that inside said sliding pin (19) 
a pressurising line (24) is passed which opens into a pressurised chamber (26) at the 

end of said cylinder bore (17).  
 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that the face (27) 
of said tapered piston (16) is adapted to be pressurised through said pressurising line 

(23). 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that said tapered 
piston (16) is provided with a peripheral piston packing (21) in the region of the non-reduced 

cylinder cross-section. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that said cylinder 
bore (17) is eccentrically provided in said tapered piston (16). 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that the effective 
cross-sectional area of said ram(4) is made substantially smaller than the annular cross-sectional 

area formed by the clamping head (2) and said clamping piston (3).
