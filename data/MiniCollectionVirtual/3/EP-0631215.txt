<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic bearing is provided with a simulating 
circuit (10) for estimating a displacement of a 

rotor (1) on the basis of a force which is exerted on 
the rotor (1). An output of the simulating circuit 

(10) is compared with an actual displacement signal. A 
delay circuit (13) and a subtracter (21) are provided 

to subtract a run-out which was estimated one period 
before the rotation of the rotor from the displacement 

signal. A displacement signal from which the run-out 
component was eliminated is set to a new displacement 

signal. A signal which is obtained by adding an estimation 
run-out of one period before, namely, an output 

of the delay circuit to the run-out which was estimated 
by comparing the output of the simulating circuit (10) 

with the new displacement signal is newly inputted to 
the delay circuit (13). Due to this, the run-out 

component is eliminated from the displacement signal of 
the magnetic bearing, a load of power amplifiers (7a, 

7b) for driving electromagnets (3a, 3b) is reduced, 
there is a surplus for a saturation which is caused in 

a high frequency band, the reliability of a control 
system is improved, and a deterioration of a positional 

accuracy which is caused by the run-out is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic bearing
apparatus having a magnetic bearing for rotatably supporting a
rotor by using a magnetic force.A magnetic bearing according to the invention
is an active magnetic bearing for supporting a
rotor in a space by an attracting force of electromagnets
which face each other through the rotor. To
stably support the rotor, the position of the rotor is
always monitored by a displacement sensor and an electromagnetic
force of an active type magnetic bearing is
controlled on the basis of an output signal of the
displacement sensor. A compensating circuit which is
used in the control of the magnetic bearing is generally
fundamentally based on a PID control.Fig. 7 shows a concept of a radial bearing
as one of the magnetic bearings. Reference numeral 1
denotes a rotor; 2 a displacement sensor; 3a and 3b
electromagnets; 4 a converter of the displacement
sensor; 5 a compensating circuit; 6 a positive/negative
switcher; 7a and 7b power amplifiers (current amplifiers);
and 8 an auxiliary bearing. The control of
such a magnetic bearing has been disclosed in "Dynamics
of Apparatuses Using Electromagnetic Force", Corona 
Co., Ltd., published on 25 July, 1990, pages 159 - 176,
and Hannes Bleuler, "Decentralized Control of Magnetic
Rotor Bearing Systems", (thesis for a degree of a
Switzerland College of an Institute of Technology),
Juris Druck + Verlag Zurich, 1984. An apparatus for
taking a countermeasure for an overload at the time of
a high speed rotation in case of using the magnetic
bearing is disclosed in JP-A-4-8911.In the above conventional magnetic bearing,
in order to assure a rigidity or damping property of
the bearing, it is necessary to set a gain of a compensating
circuit to a large value. Such a point is
particularly, remarkable in a high frequency region.
In this case, noises cannot help being amplified. On
the other hand, since a load of a power amplifier is an
electromagnet, namely, inductance, a current control
ability is limited in the high frequency region in
which the impedance increases. When a current command
over the ability is given to the power amplifier, since
the ability of the power amplifier is saturated, phase
characteristics are deteriorated and it is difficult to
control the magnetic bearing as a whole system and
instability is enhanced. To avoid such a situation,
therefore, it is necessary to prevent that a current
command in a high frequency range such as noises or the
like is inputted to the power amplifier.As one of the causes of the high
