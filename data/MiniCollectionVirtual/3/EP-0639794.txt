<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic colour
couplers and photographic materials containing them
and particularly to yellow dye-forming couplers.Redox amplification processes have been
described, for example in British Specification Nos.
1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In
such processes colour materials are developed to
produce a silver image (which may contain only small
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier)
to form a dye image. The developer-amplifier
solution contains a reducing agent, for
example a colour developing agent, and an oxidising
agent which will oxidise the colour developing agent
in the presence of the silver image which acts as a
catalyst. The photographic material used in such a
process may be a conventional coupler-containing
silver halide material or an image transfer material
containing redox dye releasers. Oxidised colour
developer reacts with a colour coupler (usually
contained in the photographic material) to form image
dye. The amount of dye formed depends on the time of
treatment or the availability of colour coupler rather
than the amount of silver in the image as is the case
in conventional colour development processes. Examples
of suitable oxidising agents include peroxy compounds
including hydrogen peroxide and compounds which
provide hydrogen peroxide, eg addition compounds of
hydrogen peroxide; cobalt (III) complexes including
cobalt hexammine complexes; and periodates. Mixtures
of such compounds can also be used. A particular
application of this technology is in the processing of 
silver chloride colour paper, especially such paper
with low silver levels.A problem encountered with such low silver
materials designed to be processed by an redox
amplification process is that the image dyes produced,
especially in the yellow dye-forming layers, have a
lower than expected covering power.GB-A-2083640 describes couplers which on reaction
with oxidised colour developing agent form dyes of
such limited mobility that image smearing occurs
allowing the dye clouds to diffuse to a limited
extent. The advantage is that granularity is very
significantly reduced.According to the present invention there are
provided photographic yellow dye-forming couplers
having the general formula:

   wherein Z is a ballasted group which splits off
on silver halide development which is of such size and
configuration to render the coupler non-diffusible in
photographic layers,
   R1 and R2 are each individually an alkyl
