<ABSTRACT>
A housing for telecommunications equipment has therein a vertical passageway 
extending in said housing alongside racks for holding such equipment and between 

upper and lower entry ways provided by said housing to admit into said passageway 
from either above or below one or more external cables for servicing equipment in 

the racks. For each rack there is a flexible extension cable having a front end with a 
coaxial fitting thereon disposed in the passageway and running from such front end 

to the corresponding rack to there be coupled with a cable receptor connector. The 
coaxial fitting on each extension cable is coupleable to an end coupling on the free 

end of a corresponding external cable. The coaxial fitting on each extension is 
mounted on a rockable platform pivotally supported from the corresponding rack and 

angularly selectably adjustable between and secured at two positions of the platform 
at which the fitting thereon points, respectively, upwardly and downwardly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to housings for accommodating 
electrical equipment adapted to be served by one or more electric cables originating 
externally of the housing and admitted from outside of to inside the housing to there 
terminate and be electrically coupled to said equipment when installed, see for example EP-A-0 487 802. Housings of the sort described are designed to be installed in rooms in 
which the one or more cables which terminate in the housing may approach it either 
from above the housing (as, say, in ducts above the ceiling of the room) or from 
below the housing (as, say, in ducts below the room's floor). Since it is often not 
possible to predict in advance whether a particular housing will be installed in a 
room where the cable or cables to end at the housing will approach it from above or 
below, it has been a common practice to have housings of two different designs to 
meet those two contingencies. That is, past housings have commonly been either of 
a first design having only an upper entry way for admitting a cable approaching from 
above, and extending down into the housing to a free end or, alternatively, of a 
second design having only a lower entry way for admitting a cable approaching the 
housing from below and extending upwardly into the housing to a free end. Housings of either the first design or the second design have included as 
feature a cable receptor connector to which the free end of the admitted cable was 
mechanically coupled in order to electrically couple the cable to equipment in the 
housing. Such receptor connector differed, however, for the two designs in that, in 
housing with upper entry ways and lower entry ways, respectively, the connector 
from its support extended vertically upwards and downwards, respectively, in the 
first and second of such designs. By thus having such receptor connector point in 
each case more or less towards the entry of the housing through which the cable will 
be admitted, the free end of the cable can be coupled to the connector while avoiding 
or reducing to acceptable value any bend necessarily made in the cable in order to 
effect such coupling. In such matter, it is to be noted that a cable of the sort 
described is often quite stiff and cannot be flexed to have a bending radius of less 
than a minimum critical size without doing damage to the cable. While the providing of housings of two different designs for receiving 
cables respectively overlying and underlying the housing on their approaches thereto 
is

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus comprising, a vertically upstanding container (45) for 
holding equipment (65), a flexible extension cable (76) having a central portion (79) 

and a front end (78) spaced away from said container and adjustable in position, said 
cable extending from said central portion to said container, at which said cable has a 

rear end (77) fixedly mechanically coupled to said container and electrically 
connectable to said equipment when installed in said container, and a fitting (81) on 

said front end of said cable and electromechanically connectable with the free end 
(39) of a field cable (37) for serving said equipment, said apparatus having 

a mounting (90) located outside said container and carrying said 
fitting, said mounting being adjustable between and securable at first and 

second positions of said mounting at which said front end of said extension cable 
extends upwardly and downwardly, respectively, from said central portion of said 

cable. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 which is further characterized by a 
vertically upstanding housing (10) within which said container (45) and mounting 

(90) are located, said housing (10) having an upper entry way (35) and a lower entry 
way (36) which are vertically spaced from each other and through either one of 

which a length (38) of said field cable (37) may be admitted into said housing for 
connection of its free end (39) to said fitting (81), and said mounting (90) being 

located in said housing vertically intermediate said upper and lower entry ways. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 in which said housing has a left side (15) 
and a right side (16) laterally spaced from each other horizontally, said container is 

laterally spaced from said left side to provide inside said housing, between said left 
side and container, a passageway (50) vertically extending between and 

communicating with said upper and lower entry ways, said passageway having in 
said housing a lateral horizontal extent and a longitudinal horizontal extent greater 

than said lateral extent, and in which said mounting is located in said passageway, 
and said fitting on said mounting is connectable to said free end of said field cable by 

bending of said length of said field cable longitudinally and vertically in said 
passageway. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1-3 in which said mounting 
comprises a platform (100) which carries said fitting (81), and which is rockable  

 
about a pivot axis (107) to thereby provide for adjustment of said mounting (90) 

between said first and second positions thereof. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1-4 in which there are at least 
mountings (90) vertically spaced from each other and adjustable between and 

securable at respective first and second positions therefor, said platforms carrying 
respective fittings 81 each connectable, by way of respectively associated flexible 

extension cables 76, to equipment 65 when installed in container 45, and in which 
said platforms, fittings and extension cables accommodate connection to said 

equipment of at least two field cables 37 of which one and the other are admitted into 
said housing 10 through, respectively, said upper entry way (35) and lower entry 

way (36).
