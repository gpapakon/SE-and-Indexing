<ABSTRACT>
Device for storing solar energy comprising a buffer 
tank (6) having connected thereto a fluid circuit consisting 

of a collector (1) for placing in sunlight, a heat exchanger 
arranged (10) in the buffer tank and a first pipe (2) between 

collector and exchanger in addition to a second pipe (4) 
between exchanger and collector, which second pipe contains 

a controlled fluid pump (5), wherein in the circuit is 
arranged a draindown tank (3) which is situated in the bottom 

part of the buffer tank (6), wherein the draindown tank is 
embodied as double-walled bottom of the buffer tank such 

that a heat transfer takes place via the partition wall, 
whereby a low positioning of the buffer tank is achieved 

as well as a certain drain-back of the fluid when the 
fluid pump is switched off and an increase in efficiency 

due to a continuing heat transfer to the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for storing solar
energy comprising a buffer tank having connected thereto
a fluid circuit consisting of a collector to be placed in
sunlight, a tube coil heat exchanger arranged in the
buffer tank and a first pipe between collector and
exchanger in addition to a second pipe between exchanger
and collector, said second pipe containing a controlled
fluid pump, wherein in the circuit is arranged a
draindown tank situated in the bottom part of the buffer
tank, said draindown tank being embodied as a double-walled
bottom of the buffer tank.The fluid in the circuit serves to absorb heat in
the collector and subsequently carry it to the buffer
tank and transfer the heat to a medium in the buffer
tank. This medium can be used for different purposes, for
instance as tap water. Such a device is protected in that
in the case of overheating for instance the pump is
switched off and the fluid can flow out of the collector.
Conversely, when the temperature is too cold the pump can
likewise be switched off so that the fluid can now also
flow out of the collector, whereby the collector is
safeguarded against freezing. This drain-back of the
fluid out of the collector is made possible by placing a
draindown tank in the circuit. Such a device is disclosed
in US-A-4,574,779.The invention has for its object to provide a device
with a higher efficiency, which device is distinguished
according to the invention in that the partition wall of
the double wall protrudes spherically downward into the
draindown tank and a level control for the buffer tank is
arranged, such that, when the pump stops, the volume of the circuit fluid will
be sufficient to contact said spherical partition wall 
such that a heat transfer takes place via said partition
wall, and a debouchment of the tube coil heat exchanger
is arranged to the side of the lowest part of the
partition wall and is oriented perpendicularly downward.According to the invention said heat exchanger,
which is embodied as tube coil, is arranged in the
buffer tank. The internal diameter of the tube can herein
be smaller than 18 mm, preferably 15 mm. This provides
the guarantee that the tube coil can be vented when the
fluid flows back during start-up to the draindown tank
via the comparatively narrow tube coil, wherein the air
is pushed up to that tank, which contributes to a better
heat transfer of the tube coil in the buffer tank. This
is particularly the case in a so-called closed circuit of
the fluid. Such a circuit can be made completely
