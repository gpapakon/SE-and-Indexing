<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal power generator 
for generating electric power by utilizing a high heat source and 
a low heat source, and in particular improves an electric power 
generating effect by providing evaporator, vapor-liquid 
separator, absorber and regenerator, increases thermal efficiency 
of evaporator and condenser, and reduces costs of constructing 
the apparatus. An oceanic thermal power generator of the kind for obtaining 
electric power by utilizing a temperature difference between warm 
sea water at high temperature in an oceanic surface layer and 
cold sea water at low temperature in an oceanic deep layer has 
hitherto been constructed as each one of an evaporator, a turbine 
connected to a generator and a condenser as a main apparatus. 
These features are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Publication No. 1989/90, which is directed to an oceanic thermal 
power generator and on which the preamble of appendant claim 1 is 
based. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1990/90, 
which is directed to a control device in oceanic thermal power 
generation, also discloses these features. In the case of circulating warm sea water through an 
evaporator, circulating cold sea water through a condenser, 
evaporating a working fluid by the temperature difference between 
both and condensing, and driving a turbine in this period and 
generating power, the warm sea water circulated through the 
evaporator is extracted from a surface layer of the ocean having 
a high temperature, such as 15-33°C, and plankton, spawn and dirt 
floating therein adhere to a heat transfer surface of the main  
 
apparatus and the thermal conductivity efficiency is 
disadvantageously lowered. As general methods of preventing 
stains for removing such disadvantage, there are methods of 
preventing planktonic stains by injecting chlorine into 
circulating sea water, or providing an electrode in circulated 
sea water and generating chloride by electrolysis, and there is 
a method of preventing any other stains by circulating sponge 
balls, brushes and the like with circulated sea water through the 
main apparatus. However, the thermal exchange temperature 
difference is small in oceanic thermal power generation, such 
that the amount of circulated sea water becomes enormous, and as 
a result, with such general methods of preventing stains there 
are problems such as high cost, environmental pollution and the 
like. For example, the method of using sponge balls, brushes and 
the like requires many
