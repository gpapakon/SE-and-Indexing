<ABSTRACT>
A transport apparatus (10) for transporting articles (12) includes a planar element (14) having a working surface (16, 16A) configured to receive articles (12). Two lines of orifices (19) extend completely through the planar element (14). Fluid delivered through the orifices (19) exits through the outlets (20, 20A) of the orifices (19) in opposite transverse directions and provides a motive force which transports the article (12) while providing a pressure differential which suppports the article (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transport 
system for moving articles. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a fluid transport system 
for moving articles in a controlled manner with the 
article held adjacent the transport by the conveying 
fluid, as known from FR-A-2 131 976. Devices such as air tables which provide a 
cushion of air on which an article can float are well 
known. Air conveyers which use air flow to impart 
translational movement while floating the article 
along a plane parallel to a surface also are well 
known. Transport tables which use directional air 
jets to transport articles also are known. For 
example U.S.-A-4,081,201, 
U.S.-A-4,278,366, and 
U.S.-A-4,395,165 disclose 
transporting computer chips and wafers using an air 
film at low speeds and with the air exiting the system 
at a large acute angle with respect to the surface 
along which the chips and wafers are transported. 
U.S.-A-3,180,688, 
U.S.-A-3,645,581, U.S.-A-3,614,168 
and U.S.-A-3,718,371 
disclose various 
conveyors which use air which exits the system at 
smaller acute angles less than 30° with respect to the 
surface along which the articles are transported. 
U.S.-A-3,231,165 discloses an 
air conveyor for transporting flexible webs which uses 
outwardly oriented air outlets. This system requires 
backwardly facing outlets to help stretch taut the  
 
webs as well as a segmented surface to exhaust the 
transport air. These systems are relatively complex, 
and simpler and more efficient systems are desired. None of the known systems mentioned above discloses a fluid 
transport apparatus which can transport articles 
including flexible webs in which the working surface, 
adjacent which articles are transported, is continuous 
and substantially smooth to permit fluid delivered to 
the working surface to exhaust off of the working 
surface at the side edges of the working surface. 
None of these systems discloses a fluid transport 
system in which the fluid is delivered to the working 
surface along first and second arrays which are 
located on opposite sides of the longitudinal 
centerline of the working surface to transport 
flexible articles, with each of the outlets oriented 
to deliver fluid at an outward angle with the 
direction of transport to prevent impingement of the 
fluid flows from the two arrays, without requiring 
backwardly directed air flow from backwardly directed 
outlets. None of these systems disclose outlets which 
can have relatively small length-to-width ratios while 
eje

A transport apparatus for transporting articles 
(12) comprising: 


a working surface (16;16A) having a longitudinal 
centerline and two side edges, wherein the 

working surface (16;16A) is continuous and substantially 
smooth to permit fluid delivered to 

the working surface (16;16A) to exhaust off of 
the working surface (16;16A) at the side edges 

of the working surface (16;16A), and 
means for orientation independently transporting 
and supporting the article (12) along the 

working surface (16;16A) comprising a plurality 
of orifices (19) terminating in outlets (20,20A) 

on the working surface (16;16A) for delivering 
the fluid to the working surface (16;16A) along 

first and second arrays which determines the 
transport path of the article (12), wherein the 

first and second arrays are located on opposite 
sides of the longitudinal centerline of the 

working surface (16;16A), wherein each of the 
orifices (19) is oriented to deliver fluid at 

an effective angle with the direction of transport, the 
fluid flow (64) direction including a cross-directional 

component (62) perpendicular to the 
direction of transport and a directional component 

(66) parallel to the direction of 
transport, and wherein the fluid flow (64) from 

the outlets (20,20A) of the first array does not 
impinge the fluid flow from the outlets (20,20A) 

of the second array adjacent the working surface 
(16;16A), wherein fluid exiting the outlets (20, 

20A) transports the article (12) along the 
working surface (16;16A) and supports the  

 
article (12) adjacent and spaced from the 

working surface (16;16A) while preventing the 
article (12) from contacting the working surface 

(16;16A) during transport,
characterized in that
 
the outlets (20,20A) extend through the 

working surface (16;16A) to deliver fluid from 
the orifices (19) to the working surface (16; 

16A) at an effective angle (a) wherein each 
outlet (20,20A) has a cross section on the 

working surface (16;16A) with a length-to-width 
ratio ℓ/w of each outlet (20, 20A) less than 

that governed by the equation 
ℓ/w = 1/sin a
. 
The transport apparatus according to claim 1 
characterized in that each orifice (19) creates an 

angular, non-linear, stepped path for the fluid.

direction of each outlet (20,20A) in the first 

array of outlets is away from that of each outlet

flexing, while maintaining the web in tension.
