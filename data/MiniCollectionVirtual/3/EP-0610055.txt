<ABSTRACT>
A compound objective lens is composed of a hologram lens 
for transmitting a part of incident light without any 

diffraction to form a beam of transmitted light and 
diffracting a remaining part of the incident light to form a 

beam of first-order diffracted light, and an objective lens 
for converging the transmitted light to form a first 

converging spot on a front surface of a thin type of first 
information medium and converging the diffracted light to form 

a second converging spot on a front surface of a thick type of 
second information medium. Because the hologram lens 

selectively functions as a concave lens for the diffracted 
light, a curvature of the transmitted light differs from that 

of the diffracted light. Therefore, even though the first and 
second information mediums have different thicknesses, the 

transmitted light incident on a rear surface of the first 
information medium is converged on the its front surface, and 

the diffracted light incident on a rear surface of the second 
information medium is converged on the its front surface. That 

is, the compound objective lens has two focal points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging optical system for converging light
on two converging spots, e.g. placed at different depths of an information medium,
with a compound objective lens composed of an objective lens and a hologram lens
which has two focal points, an optical head apparatus for recording, reproducing or
erasing information on or from an information medium such as an optical medium or
a magneto-optical medium like an optical 
disk or an optical card with the imaging optical system and an optical disk apparatus
for recording or reproducing information on or from an optical disk with the
compound objective lens.An optical memory technique has been put to practical use
to manufacture an optical disk in which a pit pattern formed
of a series of pits is drawn to record information. The
optical disk is utilized as a high density and large capacity
of information medium. For example, the optical disk is
utilized for a digital audio disk, a video disk, a document
file disk, and a data file disk. To record information on the
optical disk and to reproduce the information from the optical
disk, a light beam radiated from a light source is minutely
converged in an imaging optical system, and the light beam
minutely converged is radiated to the optical disk through the
imaging optical system. Therefore, the light beam is required
to be reliably controlled in the imaging optical system with 
high accuracy.The imaging optical system is utilized for an optical
head apparatus in which a detecting system is additionally
provided to detect the intensity of the light beam reflected
from the optical disk. Fundamental functions of the optical
head apparatus are classified into a converging performance
for minutely converging a light beam to form a diffraction-limited
micro-spot of the light beam radiated on the optical
disk, a focus control in a focus servo system, a tracking
control in a tracking serve system, and the detection of pit
signals (or information signals) obtained by radiating the
light beam on a pit pattern of the optical disk. The
fundamental function of the optical head apparatus is
determined by the combination of optical sub-systems and a
photoelectric transfer detecting process according to a
purpose and a use. Specifically, an optical head apparatus in
which a holographic optical element (or hologram) is utilized
to minimize and thin the optical head apparatus has been
recently proposed.Fig. 1 is a constitutional view of a conventional optical
head apparatus proposed in Japanese
