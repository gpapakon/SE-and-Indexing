<ABSTRACT>
A security device for protecting a protected area (110) 
comprises two laser reflectometer detectors (100). Each detector 

(100) produces an area swept laser beam (102) aligned to sweep an 
area outside the protected area and has a time-of-flight detector 

for detecting reflections by objects in the path of the laser 
beam outside the protected area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intruder detection systems, 
and more specifically to laser based intruder detection systems. Intrusion detection systems using radiation emitters and 
receivers are well known in the art. One method comprises projecting a beam of infrared radiation 
toward a field of view over a protected area and receiving back 
a reflection of the projected beam. Any changes in the strength 
or phase of the reflected beam, or distance traveled by the 
projected and received beam, indicates the possibility of an 
intruder. An example of such a system is described in U.S. Patent 
4,949,074. Another method is to use a series of laser beams to define a 
perimeter. Any invasion of the perimeter is sensed by interruption 
of the beams. An example of such a system is described in 
U.S. Patent 3,825,916 wherein a continuous chain of laser beams 
is constructed from two line-of-sight beams displaced horizontally 
and vertically from each other. To construct the chain, a 
number of transmitting and receiving stations, and possibly 
corner reflectors are required. Two problems arise, particularly when protecting "open", 
outdoor areas such as a soldier's sleeping quarters. First, as a 
laser beam is normally a narrow, sharply defined beam, there is 
the problem of preventing an intruder from simply crawling over 
or under a single laser beam used to mark the perimeter. Secondly,  
 
if a plurality of beams are used to define the perimeter, 
there is the problem of producing the plurality of beams using 
the fewest components, to make set-up of the system simple. Additionally, an alarm system as described above would not 
be effective in protecting a military zone such as a soldier's 
sleeping quarters. This is because an alarm system as described 
above only triggers an alarm when an intruder actually enters the 
protected zone. In military situations, what is needed is a 
protected zone, where intrusion in the vicinity of the protected 
zone triggers an alarm. It is an object of the present invention to provide a perimeter 
security device capable of protecting a zone by alerting 
about intrusions in the vicinity of the zone. The invention 
accomplishes the objective using a relatively minimum amount of 
components. The invention employs two laser detectors, each comprising a 
laser beam source operative to sweep the required dangerous space 
around a, preferably quadrilateral shaped, protected zone. Each 
detector also includes a time-of-flight detector for detecting 
reflections caused by

<CLAIMS>
A security device for protecting a protected area, 
comprising: 

   first and second laser reflectometer detectors, each comprising: 

      an area swept laser beam aligned to sweep an area 
outside the protected area; and 

      a time-of-flight detector for detecting reflections by 
objects in the path of the laser beam outside the protected area. 
A perimeter security device according to claim 1 having 
said detectors placed at opposite corners of a quadrilateral 

shaped zone comprising the protected area, wherein the two 
detectors are operative to detect reflections by objects in an 

area surrounding the entire perimeter of the zone. 
A perimeter security device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
each detector further comprises: 

   rotational projection means for sweeping said laser beam 
through a horizontal angular displacement so that objects over a 

wide horizontal area may be detected. 
A perimeter security device according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein each detector further comprises: 

   vertical projection means for moving said laser beam up and 
down during a sweep so that objects at various heights may be 

detected. 
A perimeter security device according to any one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein said laser beam is swept vertically and rotationally to 

 
cover the space outside of the perimeter of said area without 

sweeping the space inside the protected area. 
A perimeter security device according to any preceding 
claim, further comprising: 

   a computer for: 
      controlling the sweep of said laser beam; 

      calculating a distance to a target; and 
      distinguishing fixed background objects from threatening 

objects. 
A perimeter security device according to claim 6, wherein 
said computer is further used for distinguishing man-sized 

objects from non-threatening moving background objects. 
A perimeter device according to claim 6 or 7, further comprising: 
   display means for displaying an image of the swept area so 

that fixed background and moving objects may be seen and 
distinguished by a person. 
A portable perimeter security device according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein system components are easily portable by 

a person and also having a portable battery for a power source.
