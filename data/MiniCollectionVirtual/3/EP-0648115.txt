<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a composition for delayed release of an active substance, the active substance being incorporated in a polysaccharide matrix which consists of an essentially crystalline straight-chain glucan and contains a glucan-degrading agent. The glucan is in particular an (alpha)-glucan which has essentially a helix structure. The glucan-degrading agent is preferably (alpha)-amylase. The composition can contain high-molecular materials such as proteins, allergens, vaccine substances and microorganisms, and preferably has the form of compressed tablets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition for delayed release of an 
active substance in a target environment, the active substance being 
incorporated in a polysaccharide matrix. Compositions for delayed release of an active substance, for 
example for delayed release of an enzyme for oral administration in the 
gastrointestinal tract of a mammal, have advantages, inter alia because 
the administration of the active substance can take place in a small 
number of doses and because a more constant concentration is obtained in 
the target environment. Compositions for delayed release are known in diverse forms. One 
form of delayed release can comprise the presence of a matrix containing 
the active substance therein, which matrix slowly dissolves in the 
aqueous environment and thus releases the active substance in a delayed 
manner; a composition of this type is, for example, disclosed in European 
Patent Application EP-A-241179. A composition of this type in which the 
matrix is formed by a natural polysaccharide such as xanthan is disclosed 
in International Patent Application WO-A-87,05212. According to a variant 
thereof, the active substance is packaged in an insoluble capsule which 
is provided with a water-soluble stopper, as disclosed, inter alia, in 
British Patent Application 2,241,485. Another form of a composition for delayed release is a 
composition from which the active substance is released by erosion, as 
is disclosed, for example, in European Patent Application EP-A-381182. Compositions for delayed release in which the matrix material is 
a β-glucan, such as cellulose or a cellulose derivative, are disclosed, 
inter alia, in International Patent Application WO-A-88,10284 and 
Netherlands Patent Application 87,02294 (=GB-A-2,195,893). The use of 
heat-modified starch as the matrix for the controlled release of 
medicaments for oral administration is described by J. Herman and J.P. 
Remon, Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 56, 51-63 and 65-70 (1989). The known compositions for the delayed release of an active 
substance frequently have the disadvantage that release is possible only 
for substances dissolving in the environment or effectively diffusing 
through the matrix material. Furthermore, the active substance of the 
known compositions does not normally proceed in accordance with an ideal 
zero order rate, that is to say with a constant amount per unit time,  
 
but in accordance with a first order rate, that is to say with an amount 
which decreases per unit time, or poorer; in addition, the
