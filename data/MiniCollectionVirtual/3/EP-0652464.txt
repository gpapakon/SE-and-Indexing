<ABSTRACT>
An aperture/shutter mechanism includes one or 
more shutter blades (66) moveable to various aperture 

openings between a fully open and closed position. At 
least one damping member (34,38) has a damping surface in 

continuous frictional contact with at least a portion 
of a surface of the one or more shutter blades (66) to 

substantially prevent oscillation of the one or more 
shutter blades during movement to the various aperture 

openings between the fully open and closed positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field
of photography, and, more particularly, to an
aperture/shutter mechanism having a damping member
which substantially prevents oscillation of shutter
blades in the shutter mechanism.Stepper motor driven aperture/shutter systems
have been notorious for the shutter blades oscillating,
under damped behavior, when opened to a desired
aperture position. Much has been done to damp this
oscillating motion, such as the use of elaborate
controls for driving the stepper motor. However, the
use of elaborate motor controls is expensive and
complicates the operation of the aperture/shutter
system.Another method of addressing the oscillating
motion of shutter blades is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 3,852,786, issued in the names of Onda et al. on
December 3, 1974. The Onda patent discloses a shutter
assembly having a plurality of shutter blades divided
in a shutter-opening blade group and a shutter-closing
blade group. A shutter actuating mechanism
independently actuates both groups of shutter blades to
effect opening and closing of a shutter aperture. A
flexible spring plate having a series of protuberances
thereon is disposed along the path of travel of the
shutter blades. As each blade group nears the end of
its working stroke, the shutter blades collide with 
selected ones of the protuberances to effect flexing of
the spring plate to cause movement of other ones of the
protuberances into firm frictional engagement with the
shutter blades. Consequently, the shutter blades are
pressed together to absorb the kinetic energy of the
shutter blades and effectively dampen their rapid
movement.US-A-5,173,728 discloses an aperture/shutter mechanism comprising
one shutter blade 25 moveable between an open position
and a closed position, wherein a damping member 89 having
a damping surface in continuous frictional contact with a
portion of a surface of said shutter blade to substantially
prevent oscillation of said shutter blade during movement between
said open and closed positions, said frictional contact
is produced by a frictional force induced by a magnet 16. The
shutter blade defines an aperture when moved to an open position,
and said damping member 89 has an aperture 91 aligned
with said aperture defined by said shutter blade.In aperture/shutter assemblies wherein the
shutter blades can be opened to a number of different
positions to create different aperture sizes,
oscillation of the shutter blades will occur at each of
the different positions. This oscillation causes an

<CLAIMS>
An aperture shutter mechanism (10) comprising one or more
shutter blades (66) moveable between an open position and a

closed position and damping means (34; 38) having a damping
surface in continuous frictional contact with at least a portion

of a surface of said one or more shutter blades to substantially
prevent oscillation of said one or more shutter

blades during movement between said open and closed positions,

characterized in that
 said damping means (34; 38) includes
a pair of damping members (34; 38) each having a damping

surface in continuous frictional contact with a substantial
portion of respective opposed surfaces of said one or

more shutter blades (66) in a manner sandwiching said one or
more shutter blades between said damping members to substantially

prevent oscillation of said one or more shutter blades
during movement between said open and closed positions.

said one or more shutter blades (66) define an aperture when

moved to said open position, and said damping member (34; 38)
has an aperture aligned with said aperture (35; 39) defined

by said one or more shutter blades.
