<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid valve assembly comprising 
solenoid windings (44) positioned around a central core (56) and 

a movable valve element (82) arranged on the axis of the 
windings, the windings being supported by a spindle 

having a boss (20) adapted to be received in an opening 
formed in a body at one end of the spindle and a fluid 

fitting (42) adapted to establish a connection with a 
pressure line at the opposite end of the spindle, and 

sealant structure for sealing the interior of the 
spindle from external contaminants including an 

encapsulation material (46,48,50) surrounding the spindle and the 
windings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solenoid valve assembly and to a
process of manufacturing the same.DE-U-0812707 generally discloses a solenoid valve assembly
comprising a spindle with a central opening, a movable valve element in said
opening, an electric coil surrounding said central opening; a fluid fitting at one end
of said opening, a mounting boss at the other end of said opening; a valve orifice
in said spindle adapted to register with said valve element when said coil is
deenergized, said valve element and said valve orifice thereby providing controlled
fluid flow through said central opening; and an encapsulation enclosing said
spindle.According to one aspect of the present invention as claimed, the
aforesaid generally disclosed solenoid valve assembly is characterized in that a
sealant material surrounds said spindle and the encapsulation compresses the
sealant against said spindle, thereby hermetically sealing said coil.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a process for manufacturing a solenoid valve assembly comprising
moulding a spindle from nylon material, winding electrical windings around said
spindle, enclosing said windings in a housing; applying a silicone sealant in liquid
form to said spindle at one axial side of said windings; curing said sealant with
ultraviolet light to harden the sealant; placing said spindle and said windings in a
mould; injecting nylon material into said mould thereby surrounding said windings
and said spindle with nylon and encapsulating said windings and said spindle
upon injection of said nylon material into said mould as said nylon material
compresses said sealant against said spindle.A solenoid valve assembly in accordance with the invention has the
advantage that the compression of the sealant against the spindle by the
encapsulation produces a permanent barrier between the spindle and the
encapsulation material thereby improving the sealing of the coil from the
environmental conditions and hence increasing the durability of the assembly. The solenoid valve assembly of the present invention may be
adapted especially for controlling transfer of a pneumatic fluid, such as air, in an
automatic air suspension system for an automotive vehicle. The solenoid valve
assembly allows for delivery of air from an air spring of the suspension system
when the vehicle height is lowered. The vehicle height can be raised as an air
compressor delivers actuating pressure through the valve assembly to the air
spring. This may occur, for
