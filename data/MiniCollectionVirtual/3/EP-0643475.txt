<ABSTRACT>
In an amplitude demodulator for broadcast receivers, an intermediate-frequency signal is converted into a digital intermediate-frequency signal. The digital intermediate-frequency signal is converted to baseband and is demodulated with respect to amplitude. Amplification of the signal demodulated with respect to amplitude is controlled so that the DC component of the signal demodulated with respect to amplitude is kept constant.

<CLAIMS>
Amplitude demodulator for a broadcast radio receiver, comprising:

means (2) for conversion of an intermediate-frequency signal to a digital intermediate-frequency signal,
means (3, 4) for conversion and amplitude demodulation of the digital intermediate-frequency signal to baseband, and
means (5-16) for controlled amplification of the amplitude-demodulated signal in the sense of stabilization of the DC component of the amplitude-demodulated signal.
Amplitude demodulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the amplitude-demodulated signal is passed via a multiplier (5) in order to control the gain, 
in that
 the DC component is cut off from the output signal from the multiplier (5) by means of a low-pass filter (6, 7, 8), and 
in that
 a manipulated variable is derived from the cut-off DC component and is supplied to the multiplier (5).
Amplitude demodulator according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the manipulated variable is derived from the DC component using a gradient method.
Amplitude demodulator according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the cut-off DC component is subtracted from the output signal from the multiplier
 (5), and 
in that
 the result of the subtraction can be supplied to one output of the amplitude demodulator.
Amplitude demodulator according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that
 setting variables can be supplied additively by multiplication to the DC voltage component, before the formation of the manipulated variable.
Amplitude demodulator according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the manipulated variable is formed by passing the DC component via a further multiplier (11) and a further subtractor (12), whose output signal is supplied via a delay device (13) to the further multiplier (11) and to the further subtractor (12), and forms the manipulated variable, after amplitude limiting (14).
Amplitude demodulator according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the low-pass filter which is used to derive the DC component comprises a first low-pass filter (6), a decimation stage (7) and a second low-pass filter (8).
Amplitude demodulator according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the sampling frequency of the manipulated variable is increased before being supplied to the multiplier (5).
Amplitude demodulator according to one of Claims 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the delay device (13) has a delay of one sample period of the DC component.
