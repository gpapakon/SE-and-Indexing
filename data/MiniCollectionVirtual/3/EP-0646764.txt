<ABSTRACT>
A digital display micrometer gauge in which the 
workpiece to be measured is held between an anvil 11 and a 

spindle 3. An engagement member 13 is provided at an end 
of the spindle 3, and an inner sleeve 15 having a slit 15A, 

into which the engagement member 13 is inserted, is secured 
to a U-shaped main frame, and an outer sleeve 16 having a 

helical groove 16A, which is formed in the inner peripheral 
section thereof, is provided on the outer periphery of the 

inner sleeve 15 in such a way as to be circumferentially 
rotatable. By rotating this outer sleeve, the spindle 3 

can be driven at high speed. A main scale 31 constituting 
a linear encoder is attached to a side surface of the 

spindle so as to extend along the axis of the spindle 3, 
whereby the displacement amount of the spindle 3 can be 

detected with high accuracy. A slide member slidable on 
the inner surface of the inner sleeve 15 is provided at 

that end of the spindle 3 where the engagement member 13 is 
provided, and the spindle can be inserted into the inner 

sleeve together with the main scale attached thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a digital display micrometer
gauge for measuring dimensions of a workpiece to be
measured such as length, thickness and the like, through a
displacement of a spindle.The micrometer gauge has conventionally been known as
a gauge for measuring dimensions of a workpiece to be
measured through displacement of a spindle. Since it is
easy to handle, this type of gauge is used by many
machinists. As described in US-A-4,550,507 and US-A-4,578,868,
the micrometer gauge generally comprises a
U-shaped main frame, to which an inner sleeve is secured.
A female screw thread is formed in the inner sleeve by
precision machining, and a male screw thread of a spindle,
which is likewise formed by precision machining, is engaged
with this female thread. The spindle is rotated through a
thimble connected with it, and, by reading the amount of
this rotation, the workpiece is measured.In this conventional micrometer gauge, in which the
rotation of the thimble is transmitted to the spindle
through the male and female screw threads, the screw pitch
is generally as small as approximately 0.5 mm, so that the
spindle cannot be displaced at high speed, resulting in a
rather poor operational efficiency. This is particularly
true of a case where measurement is to be conducted
repeatedly. A high speed displacement of the spindle might
be ensured by coarsening the screw pitch. However, that
would result in deterioration in the measuring accuracy of
the micrometer.Micrometer gauges designed with a view to solving the
above problem are proposed in US-A-4,485,556 and Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 3-4883. In these
gauges, the spindle is supported by the main frame at two
positions of its middle section through the intermediary of
stationary bearings. The spindle is displaced by a spindle
displacement mechanism, which comprises a sleeve engaged
with the main frame in such a way as to be rotatable but 
not movable along the axial direction of the spindle; a
helical groove formed on the inner side of this sleeve and
having a relatively large pitch; a spindle engagement
section engaged with this groove; and a spindle rotation
preventing means for controlling the rotation of the
spindle relative to the main frame. Due to this mechanism,
high speed displacement of the spindle is ensured.To ensure high measurement accuracy in digital
display, the conventional gauge disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 3-4883 includes, in addition
to the above described driving mechanism, an encoder having
a main
