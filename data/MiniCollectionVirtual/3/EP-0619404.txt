<ABSTRACT>
A roof panel with solar batteries and a roof structure 
with solar batteries, which can improve water blocking 

between adjacent solar batteries integral with the roof 
panel. On the inclined surface of the roof Y is disposed 

the base panel 2, on which support rails 37 (each having a 
two-state structure with a gutter and a cylindrical section 

37a and 37b) are provided. A plurality of solar battery 
panels 3, provided with a frame (having an upper and a lower 

frame member 6 and 7 and paired vertical frame members 8) 
therearound, are each provided between paired support frames 

37. The lower frame member 7 has an extension 25 extending 
from its side nearer the eaves N and covering the upper 

frame member 6 of the adjacent panel 3. The base and solar 
battery panels 2 and 3 are made integral with one another in 

factory to be supplied as a roof panel 1 with solar 
batteries. With this structure, water is blocked around the 

solar battery panel 3 by the frame (6 to 8) therearound. 
Rainwater having fallen onto the surface of the panel 3 is 

drained along the extension 25 to the panel 3 on the side of 
the eaves N, or is led side-wise to support rails (i.e., 

gutter sections 37a thereof) to be drained to the side of 
the eaves N.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to roof panels with solar
batteries and roof structures with solar batteries, these
roof panels and structure being capable of application to
roof portions of houses and like buildings.Heretofore, for energy saving it has been practiced to
install a plurality of solar batteries on roofs of houses or
like building structures and supply power from these solar
batteries to home.The general way of installing solar batteries on the
roof is a base securement system, in which panel-like solar
batteries are secured to an available roof via an exclusive
base.Meanwhile, in the case of a house which is built by a
panel process, there is a technique of dispensing with the
exclusive base noted above by using a roof panel with solar
batteries, in which a plurality of solar batteries are
provided to be integral with the top of a roof panel
constituting a roof.In the above roof panel with solar batteries, it is
particularly necessary to improve water blocking (i.e.,
rainwater blocking) when mounting the solar batteries to be
integral with the roof panel, and development of techniques
to this end has been desired.Particularly, there is a problem of rainwater blocking
among a plurality of solar batteries, and it has been
difficult to produce a perfect water blocking groove
structure.The present invention has been completed in view of
the above circumstances, and its object is to provide a roof 
panel with solar batteries and a roof structure with solar
batteries, which permit improvement of the water blocking
between adjacent solar batteries which are made integral
with the roof panel.The solar batteries that are used are supported with
respective frames, which are collectively supported on
support rails extending in the direction of roof
inclination such that rainwater falling onto the surfaces
of the solar batteries and support rails can be led toward
the hoof eaves for draining.In addition, rainwater, which may enter the space
between the solar battery and the frame thereof, the space
between each frame and each support rail and the space
between adjacent frames, can be received to be drained
toward the eaves of the roof.GB 2000860 discloses a roof panel with solar batteries
comprising a base panel which is arranged to be disposed
along the roof inclination from the ridge to the eaves and
a plurality of solar battery panels disposed over the base
panel; the solar battery panels each including a solar
battery in the form of a rectangular disk and a frame
mounted around the solar battery; a

A roof panel (1) with solar batteries comprising: a
base panel (2) which is arranged to be disposed along the

roof inclination from the ridge (M) to the eaves (N) and
having a plurality of parallel gutter-like support rails

(37) secured at the top and extending in the direction of
roof inclination; and a plurality of solar battery panels

(3) disposed over the base panel and each including a solar
battery (4) in the form of a rectangular disk and a frame

(6,7,8) mounted around the solar battery, the frame being
supported such that it is accommodated inside associated

ones of the support rails characterised in that the support
rails (37) each have a two-stage structure including a

gutter section (37a) capable of accommodating an associated
portion of each frame (6,7,8) and a cylindrical section

(37b) formed under and integral with the gutter section;
and each frame is supported such that it is accommodated

inside associated ones of the gutter sections.
A roof panel (1) with solar batteries according to

claim 1, wherein: each frame (6,7,8) includes four frame
members, two of the frame members being an upper (6) and a

lower (7) frame member mounted on parallel two of the four
edges of each the solar battery, the other two of the four

edges of each the solar battery, the other two of the frame
members (8) being a left and a right vertical frame member

mounted on the other two of the four edges; and the left
and right vertical frame members are supported such that

they are accommodated inside associated ones of the gutter-like
support rails (37), at least the inner space in the

lower frame member being communicated with the inside of
the associated gutter-like support rails (37).

extension having an end substantially aligned to the eaves

side end of a ridge side portion of the frame of the eaves
side adjacent solar battery panel.

one of the preceding claims, wherein: the support rails

(37) are provided in pairs each in correspondence to facing
sides of adjacent ones of the solar battery panels (3) in

a direction perpendicular to the direction of roof
inclination; a seal member (45,46) is provided between

adjacent side vertical walls (40A) of the gutter sections
(37a) of the paired adjacent support rails; and another

seal member (47) is provided such that it strides the upper
