<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an anti-theft system for 
jewelry display cases through the use of a local-field alarm 
device. Typically, when the theft of jewelry in retail stores occurs 
an entire jewelry display case is stolen. Generally, jewelry is 
displayed in a case that may contain up to as many as 25 rings or 
more. Other kinds of display cases for necklaces, for instance, 
contain fewer pieces of jewelry but are displayed in similarly 
structured cases. The anti-theft currency art is aware of the use of a local-field 
alarm device. U.S. patent 4,975,680, incorporated herein by 
reference, discloses such a device for use in automatic teller 
machines ("ATM") and for purposes of protecting currency stacks. 
Generally, a cavity is created in a stack of money and a device 
placed inside the cavity. The cavity is covered by additional 
money thus hiding the device. When a theft occurs, the perpetrator 
carries the device off with the remaining money activating an RF 
receiver. As the perpetrator leaves the premises an RF transmitter 
activates the receiver triggering a timed delay detonator which 
subsequently explodes releasing dye, smoke, and/or tear gas. Once 
exploded, the dye marks the money and thief and may be used later 
as evidence in criminal proceedings. Another form of alarm for currency may be found in U.S. patent 
3,828,341, incorporated herein by reference, wherein is disclosed 
a localized electromagnetic field generated adjacent to the exit of 
a bank. For the alarm to be triggered, the alarm pack must first 
be taken into the field and then moved out of the field, the timer 
is activated, and at the end of the timing interval the alarm is 
triggered.  Mechanistically, the present invention works in much the same 
way except that it is applied to the anti-theft jewelry art. 
Adaptations of the normal jewelry case are needed for device 
emplacement and to obscure device relationship to the jewelry case. 
For the purposes of jewelry case theft, the problem is somewhat 
different in that all cases can not be protected the way money can. 
Jewelry must be displayed, whereas money is fungible and may be 
secured from a "runaway" thief. When jewelry is displayed it is 
vulnerable to theft by simply picking up the case and running away. 
Jewelry vendors' concerns are not so much to create evidence but to 
the return of the merchandise to their store. The present invention is found useful in the return of stolen 
jewelry to a store vendor thereof and in a higher incidence of 
thief
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A jewelry anti-theft system wherein said system comprises a 
housing means communicating with a foundation means wherein a 

device is emplaced in said housing, said device comprising a 
removal detection means; field detection means; and means 

responsive to the removal detection means; and means responsive to 
the field detection means for triggering, a mechanism which 

provides a release, if (a) the removal detection means detects 
removal of said housing from said foundation and (b) said field 

detection means detects the localized field and thereafter ceases 
to detect the localized field thereby triggering said mechanism 

which at its terminus provides a release said removal detection 
means and said field detection means independent one from the other 

whereby said removal detection means is deactivated when 
recommunicated with said foundation means without activating the 

detection means. 
The system in claim 1 wherein said removal means is selected 
from the group consisting of magnetic, electrical, optical, or some 

combination thereof communication. 
The system in claim 1 wherein said release is selected from 
the group consisting of smoke, tear gas, audible alarm, dye, or 

some combination thereof. 
The system in claim 1 wherein said mechanism comprises a delay 
timing means. 
The system in claim 1 wherein said field detection means 
consists of a radio frequency.
