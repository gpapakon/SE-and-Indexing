<ABSTRACT>
An ice making machine of the type comprising a water 
tank (13) and freezing surfaces (18) such as fingers 

which are periodically contacted with water in the tank (13) 
to generate nodules of ice thereon includes an openable 

closure (17) on a side of the water tank (13) interposable 
under the ice on the freezing surfaces (18). Periodically, 

the freezing process is stopped, the water level in the tank 
(13) is lowered, the side closure (17) of the tank is opened 

and positioned under the ice on the freezing surfaces, the 
ice falling from the freezing surfaces (18) and being guided 

to a storage compartment (2) by the side closure (17).
