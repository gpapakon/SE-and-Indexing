<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of treatment and/or prevention for decreasing or combating problems of obesity, with the aim of obtaining a cosmetic and/or therapeutic effect of generalized or localized slimming on the human or animal body, the aforementioned method consisting in administering to the body, preferably topically, at least one substance capable of limiting or inhibiting the uptake of glucose by the adipocytes. It is also possible to supply the body in addition, preferably topically, with at least one compound capable of stimulating lipolysis, this compound being supplied simultaneously, separately or staggered over time with respect to the step of administration of the glucose-uptake inhibitors. The invention also relates to various cosmetic, dermatological and/or medicinal compositions intended for implementing the aforementioned method, as well as to their different uses.

<CLAIMS>
Non-therapeutic treatment process for combating 
adiposity, characterized in that it consists in 

administering to the body, via the topical and/or 
systemic route, at least one sulphur-free substance 

capable of limiting or of inhibiting glucose uptake by 
adipocytes, the substance being chosen, alone or as 

mixtures, from serine or its corresponding polymers, 
rutine or its corresponding polymers, and ceramides. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said substance is administered via the topical 

route. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said substance is administered via the oral 

route. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the said substance is N-oleyldihydrosphingosine. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the body is additionally 

supplied, via the topical and/or systemic route, with at 
least one compound capable of stimulating lipolysis. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the said supply of the said stimulator is made in a 

simultaneous or separate manner or spread out over time 
relative to the step for administration of the glucose-uptake 

inhibitors. 
Process according to either of Claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that the said supply is made via the 

topical route. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in  
 

that it consists in using a composition for topical use 
containing both the glucose-uptake inhibitors, on the one 

hand, and the lipolysis stimulators, on the other hand. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that lipolysis stimulators are used 

which are chosen, alone or as mixtures, from xanthic 
bases, in particular theophylline, caffeine, theobromine 

and 1-hydroxyalkylxanthines and their compatible salts, 
nicotinic acid derivatives, more particularly such as 

alpha-tocopherol nicotinate and hexyl nicotinate, substances 
known as alpha-2 blockers, in particular ginkgo 

biloba, and growth factors. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in order to obtain a slimming and/or thinning 

effect of the skin and/or of the figure. 
Cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical composition with 
slimming action, characterized in that it comprises, in 

a physiologically acceptable support, at least one 
sulphur-free substance capable of limiting or of 

inhibiting glucose uptake by adipocytes, the substance 
being chosen, alone or as mixtures, from serine or its 

corresponding polymers, rutine or its corresponding 
polymers, and ceramides, and at least one lipolysis 

stimulator. 
Composition according to Claim 11, characterized 
in that the said substance is as defined in Claim 4. 
Composition according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the said lipolysis stimulator is as 

defined in Claim 9. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 11 to 
13, characterized in that it is packaged in a suitable 

form for administration via a systemic route, preferably 
via the oral route. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 11 to 
13, characterized in that it is packaged in a suitable 

form for application via the topical route. 
Device containing several compartments or "kit", 
characterized in that it comprises, in a first 

compartment, at least one glucose-uptake inhibitor  
 

chosen, alone or as mixtures, from serine or its 
corresponding polymers, rutine or its corresponding 

polymers, and ceramides, and, in a second compartment, at 
least one lipolysis stimulator. 
"Kit" according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the compounds included in the said first and second 

compartments are packaged in a suitable form for topical 
application. 
"Kit" according to either of Claims 16 and 17, 
characterized in that the inhibitor is N-oleyldihydrosphingosine. 
"Kit" according to one of Claims 16 to 18, 
characterized in that the stimulator is chosen from 

xanthic bases, in particular theophylline, caffeine, 
theobromine and 1-hydroxyalkylxanthines and their 

compatible salts, nicotinic acid derivatives, more 
particularly such as alpha-tocopherol nicotinate and 

hexyl nicotinate, substances known as alpha-2 blockers, 
in particular ginkgo biloba, growth factors, and mixtures 

thereof. 
Use of a sulphur-free substance capable of 
limiting or of inhibiting glucose uptake by adipocytes as 

active principle in, or for the production of, a cosmetic 
or therapeutic composition intended to combat adiposity 

and/or to obtain a local or general slimming effect on 
the body, the said substance being chosen, alone or as 

mixtures, from serine or its corresponding polymers, 
rutine or its corresponding polymers, and ceramides.
