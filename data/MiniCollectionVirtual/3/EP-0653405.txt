<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing tertiary butyl alcohol wherein 
a feedstock comprising a solvent solution of tertiary 

butyl hydroperoxide in tertiary butyl alcohol or a mixture 
of tertiary butyl alcohol with isobutane is charged to a 

hydroperoxide decomposition reaction zone containing a 
catalytically effective amount of a hydroperoxide 

decomposition catalyst consisting essentially of alumina 
having palladium and platinum deposited thereon and is 

brought into contact with the catalyst in liquid phase 
under hydroperoxide decomposition reaction conditions to 

convert the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to decomposition 
products, principally tertiary butyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the catalytic decomposition 
of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). More 
particularly, this invention relates to a method for the 
preparation of tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) by the 
catalytic decomposition of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. 
Still more particularly, this invention relates to a 
method wherein an alumina supported palladium/platinum 
catalyst is used to catalyze the substantially selective 
decomposition of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to tertiary 
butyl alcohol. It is known to react isobutane with oxygen, either 
thermally or catalytically, to form a peroxidation 
reaction product wherein the principal peroxide that is 
formed is tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. It is also known 
to thermally or catalytically decompose the tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide to form tertiary butyl alcohol. Sanderson et al. disclose the use of a variety of 
catalysts for the decomposition of tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide in a series of U. S. patents, including a 
catalyst composed of unsupported nickel, copper, chromia 
and iron (U. S. Patent No. 4,704,482), a catalyst composed 
of iron, copper, chromia and cobalt (U. S. Patent No. 
4,705,903), a catalyst composed of a base treated 
hydrogenation catalyst from groups VIA or VIII of the 
Periodic Table (U. S. Patent No. 4,742,179), a catalyst  
 
consisting essentially of nickel, copper, chromium and 
barium (U. S. Patent No. 4,873,380), a catalyst composed 
of a metal phthalocyanine promoted with a rhenium compound 
(U. S. Patent No. 4,910,349), a catalyst composed of a 
base promoted metal phthalocyanine compound (U. S. Patent 
No. 4,912,269), a catalyst composed of a soluble ruthenium 
compound promoted with a bidentate ligand (U. S. Patent 
No. 4,912,033), a catalyst composed of a metal porphine 
such as iron (III) or manganese (III) promoted with an 
alkyl thiol or an amine, a catalyst composed of an 
imidazole promoted metal phthalocyanine compound (U. S. 
Patent No. 4,912,266), (U. S. Patent No. 4,922,034), a 
catalyst composed of a metal phthalocyanine promoted with 
a thiol and a free radical inhibitor (U. S. Patent No. 
4,922,035), a catalyst composed of a borate promoted metal 
phthalocyanine (U. S. Patent No. 4,922,036), or a catalyst 
composed of a soluble ruthenium compound and an iron 
compound such as an acetate, a borate, a bromide, a 
chloride, a 1,3-propanedionate , a 2-ethyl-hexanoate, an 
iodide, a nitrate, a 2,4-pentanedionate, a perchlorate or 
a sulfate (U. S. Patent No. 5,025,113). As stated, when isobutane is
