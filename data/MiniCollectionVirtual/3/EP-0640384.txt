<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improved foaming agents that
comprises mixture of anionic surfactant in a low vapor pressure
carrier or solubilizer. More particularly, the invention is
directed to improved foaming agents useful in the process of
making gypsum products and to the products so made.The foaming agent mixtures are readily soluble in cold
water and have a flash point that exceeds 93,3°C (200°F).In the manufacture of gypsum board, it is common practice
to incorporate air bubbles into gypsum slurries by the addition of
foaming agents. The benefits of entraining air bubbles into the 
gypsum slurries include:
(a) reduced amount of water needed to render the gypsum
slurry adequately fluid thereby minimizing the energy needed to
drive off any excess water;(b) reduced density of the hardened gypsum products; and(c) reduce cost of gypsum board.Gypsum is mainly composed of calcium sulphate. Foaming
agents, and particularly alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates
are sensitive to calcium ions. And, in the actual manufacture of
gypsum board, the foaming agent is exposed to a constant flow of
calcium ions. Thus, it is important for the foaming agent which is
to be used in the manufacture of gypsum board to be able to produce
copious amounts of foam in saturated calcium sulfate solutions
where the presence of solid gypsum particles are predominant.Therefore, it is important to test gypsum foaming agents in an
environment which is as close as possible to that which such agents
will encounter in the actual manufacturing of gypsum wallboard.
The method of evaluation used in this invention is one in which the
performance of the foaming agents is determined by their ability to
entrain air into gypsum slurries. As will be illustrated, the
foaming agents disclosed herein show substantial enhanced
performance, as measured by their ability to entrain air into
gypsum slurries, than foaming agents disclosed in the prior art. EP-A-0 336 749 discloses foaming agents comprising a mixture of
alkyl sulphates and alkyl ether sulphates, said mixture having the
formula Rx(OCH2CH2)yOSO3M, wherein Rx is a hydrocarbon chain having
