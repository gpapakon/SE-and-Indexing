<ABSTRACT>
A photonic frequency routing type time division 
highway switch which requires no conflict control at the 

input side, and incorporates no inherent splitting loss of 
the optical signal power. The switch is formed by a plurality 

of tunable frequency convertors (3-2-1 to 3-2-M) for allocating 
frequency channels to the optical signals on the input 

highways at each timeslot; a frequency router for 
connecting the optical signals outputted from the frequency 

convertors to its outputs according to the frequency 
channels allocated to the optical signals at each timeslot; and 

a plurality of frequency multiplexed output buffers (3-4-1 to 3-4-M) for 
outputting the optical signals outputted from the frequency 

router to the output highways such that a plurality of 
optical signals with different frequency channels which are 

in an identical timeslot are outputted at different 
timeslots.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a time division
highway switch in general, and more particularly to a
photonic frequency routing type time division highway
switch which can be used as a self-routing switch in a
photonic ATM switching system.. A conventionally known M × M photonic frequency
routing type time division highway switch has a typical
configuration as shown in Fig. 1, which comprises: M input
highways 1-1-1 to 1-1-M connected to an input side of a M ×
M star coupler 1-3 through M frequency convertors 1-2-1 to
1-2-M, and M output highways 1-5-1 to 1-5-M connected to an
output side of the star coupler 1-3 through M fixed filters
1-4-1 to 1-4-M.In this configuration, each frequency convertor
assigns a frequency channel corresponding to a desired
output highway for time divisional optical signals at each
timeslot on each input highway connected with it. The
optical signals on the input highways 1-1-1 to 1-1-M are
then optically coupled together by the star coupler 1-3,
and the coupled optical signals are equally split among the
output highways 1-5-1 to 1-5-M. Each fixed filter connected
with each output highway takes out only the optical signal
of the frequency channel corresponding to each output
highway connected with it out of the supplied coupled
optical signals and outputs it to the output highway
connected with it. In this manner, the switching operation 
is realized in this conventional photonic frequency routing
type time division highway switch by assigning the
frequency channel at the frequency convertor.Now, such a conventional photonic frequency routing
type time division highway switch has been associated with
the following problems.
(1) In a case it is necessary to connect two optical
signals on different input highways to the same output
highway simultaneously, the same frequency channel is going
to be assigned to both of these optical signals.
Consequently, these two optical signals are going to
conflict with each other at the star coupler 1-3, i.e., a
routing of more than one optical signals with the same
frequency is going to be requested at the same timeslot, so
that there is a need to carry out the conflict control at
the input side in advance in order to reject such
conflicting requests.(2) The optical signals inputted into the star coupler
1-3 are going to be equally split and distributed among all
the output highways 1-5-1 to 1-5-M connected to the star
coupler 1-3. For this reason, the optical power of each
input optical signal is going to be attenuated to 1/M on
each
