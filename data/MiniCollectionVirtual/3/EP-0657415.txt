<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a 3-amino-1-nitro-4-phenyl-2-butanol derivative represented by general formula (1) 
and a 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid derivative derived therefrom. In said formula, R¹ and R² represent 

each independently hydrogen or an amino-protecting group. The process can industrially provide an optically active 
amino alcohol derivative as an intermediate for synthesizing medicines such as an immunopotentiating carcinostatic 

bestatin in a high yield safely, readily and highly selectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric
acid derivatives of the general formula (11) shown below and the 3-amino-1-nitro-4-phenyl-2-butanol
derivatives of the general formula (1) shown below
which are the used intermediates. An optically active isomer of 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyric
acid (hereinafter referred to as
phenylnorstatine) obtainable from a compound of general
formula (11) serves as a starting compound for the synthesis
of the immunopotentiating anticancer agent bestatin [formula
(12)] [Journal of Antibiotics, 29, 600 (1976)] and for the
synthesis of the HIV protease inhibitor KNI-227 [formula
(13)] (Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-5-170722). Therefore,
the compounds provided by the present invention are useful as
intermediates of medicinal chemicals.
In the above formulas, R1 and R2 each independently
represents a hydrogen atom or an amino group protecting group, 
R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxy group protecting
group and R6 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group
containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.
Phenylnorstatine of the formula (14)

includes four optically active isomers. Among them, the one
that can serve as a bestatin intermediate is the (2S,3R)-threo
form and the one that can serve as a constituent of KNI-227
is the (2S,3S)-erythro form. Therefore, a technique of
selectively producing only one optical isomer is required for
the production of such forms by a commercially valuable method. Several methods are known for the stereoselective
production of the bestatin intermediate (2S,3R)-phenyl
norstatin. Typical of them are those processes that comprise
stereoselective addition of a cyanide compound to an (R)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanal
derivative derived from D-phenylalanine
[Journal of the Chemical Society Chemical
Communications, 938 (1989); Synthesis, 703 (1989); European
Patent Specification No. 341462; Japanese Kokai Publication
Hei-2-17165]. From the industrial viewpoint, however, these
processes pose a problem in that the use of a highly toxic
cyanide compound is inevitable.Other methods known include the process comprising
degradation of an optically active 2-azetidone derivative
obtained via [2+2] cycloaddition of a chiral imine and a
ketene compound [Tetrahedron Letters, 31, 3031 (1990)], and
the process comprising stereoselective alkylation and
stereoselective amination of a chiral glyoxylate [Journal of
Organic Chemistry, 54, 4235 (1989)]. However, these methods
involve a number of steps, hence are complicated from
