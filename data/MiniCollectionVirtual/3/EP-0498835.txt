<ABSTRACT>
A colored contact lens having a very natural appearance is disclosed. The inventive lens has a non-opaque pupil section and iris section that is at least partially opaque and comprised of two portions. A first portion, generally located on the outside of the iris section, has a first shade. A second portion, generally located on the inside of the iris section has a second shade. A jagged border separates the two portions. A third iris section and second jagged border are also disclosed. In some embodiments portions of the iris section may be non-opaque.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to colored contact 
lenses and in particular to such lenses having opaque colored 
portions that are able to change the apparent color of the 
wearer's iris while imparting a very natural appearance. It was recognized very early that a contact lens 
with opaque coloring should not have a simple solidly colored 
iris. Such a lens imparts a very unnatural appearance. 
Wichterle in U.S.-A- 3,679,504 discloses an opaque lens 
having an iris of more than a single color that is artistically 
drawn or photographically reproduced. Such a lens never 
achieved commercial success. Other attempts to produce an 
opaque lens with a natural appearance are disclosed in U.S.-A- 
3,536,386, (Spivak); 3,712,718 (LeGrand), 
4,460,523 (Neefe), 4,719,657 (Bawa), 4,744,647 (Meshel et 
al.), 4,634,449 (Jenkins); European Patent Publication EP-A- 0 
309 154 (Allergan) and U.K. Patent Application GB-A- 2 202 540 A 
(IGEL). Knapp (in U.S.-A- 4,582,402) discloses a 
contact lens having, in its preferred embodiment, colored, 
opaque dots. The Knapp lens has been an enormous commercial 
success. A natural appearance is achieved, yet the lens is 
simple and inexpensive to produce, using a simple one-color 
printed dot pattern. At Column 3, lines 23 to 29, Knapp 
discloses that "For a more natural effect, the printing step  
 
may be repeated one or more times using different patterns in 
different colors, since upon close examination the iris's of 
many persons are found to contain more than one color. The 
printed pattern need not be absolutely uniform, allowing for 
enhancement of the fine structure of the iris." The one-color 
Knapp lenses currently achieving commercial success have 
their dots arranged in an irregular pattern to enhance the 
structure of the iris. However, neither the Knapp commercial 
lenses, nor the Knapp patent disclose or suggest how one would 
arrange a pattern of dots having more than one color to achieve 
a more natural appearance. The present invention is predicated on the 
surprising discovery that very simple multiple-color opaque 
patterns (some of them in accordance with the Knapp 
disclosure) achieve an amazingly naturally appearing iris. The 
improvement in appearance over the one-color Knapp lenses, 
currently achieving enormous commercial success, is 
startling. Like the one color lenses, the lenses of this 
invention are able to cause a fundamental change in the 
apparent color of the wearer's iris, e.g. from dark brown to 
light blue or green. Although the preferred

A colored contact lens comprising a non-opaque pupil section and a 
colored iris section having opaque coloring surrounding said pupil 

section, wherein a first portion of 
said iris section is of a first shade, and a second portion of said iris section is of 

a second shade different from said first shade, said first portion is located 
generally on the outside of said iris section and said second portion is located 

generally on the inside of said iris section and a jagged border separates said 
first and second portions, wherein the minimum distance of said jagged border 

from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 5% to 45% of 
the radial width of said iris section, and the maximum distance of said border 

from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 45% to 95% of 
the radial width of said iris section whereby said second portion protrudes 

into said first portion. 
The colored contact lens of claim 1 wherein the opaque coloring of the said iris 
section is provided by a colored, opaque intermittent pattern over sa
id entire iris 
section, that leaves a substantial portion within the interstices of the pattern 

non-opaque, the opaque parts of said pattern covering at least 25 
percent of the area of said iris section, the elements of said pattern being 

undiscernible to a person having normal 20-20 vision standing 1.5 
meters (5 feet) from a person wearing the lens.  

 
The lens of claim 2 wherein the minimum distance of said jagged border 
from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 10% to 30% of 

the radial width of said iris section, and the maximum distance of said border 
from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 60% to 80% of 

the radial width of said iris section. 
The lens of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the elements of the pattern are 
dots. 
The lens of any one of claims 2, 3, or 4, wherein the non-opaque 
interstices are uncolored. 
The lens of any one of claims 2, 3, 4 wherein the non-opaque interstices 
are translucently colored. 
The colored lens of claim 1 wherein the coloring of the iris section is 
opaque, except for non-opaque elements in said iris section undiscernible to a 

person having ordinary 20-20 vision standing 1.5 meters (5 feet) from a person 
wearing the lens. 
The lens of claim 7 wherein the minimum distance of said jagged border 
from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 10% to 30% of 

the radial width of said iris section, and the maximum distance of said border 
from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 60% to 80% of 

the radial width of said iris section.  
 
The lens of claim 7 or claim 8 wherein the non-opaque elements of said 
iris section are uncolored. 
The lens of claim 7 or claim 8 wherein the non-opaque elements of said 
iris section are translucently colored. 
The colored contact lens of claim 1 wherein the entire iris section has 
solid opaque coloring. 
The lens of claim 11 wherein the minimum distance of said jagged 
border from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 10% to 

30% of the radial width of said iris section, and the maximum distance of said 
jagged border from the outer perimeter of said iris section is from 60% to 

80% of the radial width of said iris section. 
A lens in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 12 constructed of 
hydrophilic material.
