A breathing rehabilitation method including the step 
of measuring the breathing amplitude of a patient;
 
   characterized in that it includes the following steps: 


acquiring a reference cycle representative of the 
amplitude as a function of time of a regular breathing cycle; 
determining upper (36) and lower (37) cycles 
enclosing the reference cycle; 
permanently displaying on a screen (34) a pair of 
upper (36) and lower cycles (37); and 
displaying on the same screen a spot (40) moving in 
one direction as a function of the breathing amplitude and in a 

perpendicular direction as a function of time. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that it 
includes the step of horizontally scanning the screen (34) with 

said spot (40) and resetting the scanning when the beginning of 
an inhalation is detected, the scanning speed being such that the 

horizontal length of the screen corresponds to a period slightly 
greater than the period of the reference cycle. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that it 
includes the step of determining the upper (36) and lower (37) 

cycles so that the minimum distance separating them progressively 
increases in the direction of increasing time. 
The method of claim 3, characterized in that the 
maximum values of the upper (36), lower (37) and reference cycles 

are aligned in the amplitude direction. 
The method of claim 4, characterized in that said 
upper (36) and lower (37) cycles are determined according to the 

following steps: 

choosing a cloud of reference points corresponding to 
amplitudes (y
i
) of the reference cycle for distinct times (t
i
) 
distributed between the beginning and the end of a scan; 
determining clouds of upper and lower points from the 
reference cloud, each amplitude (yM
i
, ym
i
) being obtained by  
 

adding and subtracting respectively from the amplitude of a 
reference point a term constituted by the sum of a constant and 

of a factor that is proportional to the absolute value of the 
slope at the reference point; and 
smoothing the upper and lower clouds. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the 
breathing amplitude corresponds to a pulmonary volume. 
A device for breathing rehabilitation, including 
means (10, 11, 13, 14) for measuring the breathing amplitude of a 

patient;
 
   characterized in that it includes: 


means (30, 32) for acquiring a reference cycle 
representing the amplitude as a function of time of a regular 

breathing cycle; 
means (32) for calculating and storing upper (36) and 
lower (37) cycles enclosing the reference cycle; 
a screen (34) on which a pair of upper and lower 
cycles is permanently displayed; and 
processing means (32) for displaying on the same 
screen a spot (40) moving in one direction as a function of the 

breathing amplitude and in a perpendicular direction as a 
function of time. 
The device of claim 7, characterized in that it 
includes a plethysmograph that has thoracic (10) and abdominal 

(11) inductive windings and is connected to a microcomputer (32) 
through an analog/digital conversion board (30). 
The device of claim 7, characterized in that the 
breathing amplitudes correspond to pulmonary volumes. 
The device of claim 7, characterized in that the 
inductive windings (10, 11) are integrated in a vertically non-stretch 

vest (45) including a pelvic flap (46).
