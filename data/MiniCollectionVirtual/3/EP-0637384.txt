<ABSTRACT>
A bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) sensor comprising (1) a gold recording surface, (2) a first lipid layer which is an imperfect layer of a thiolipid which comprises the residue of two phospholipid molecules linked to each end of a disulphide (-S-S-) group, each through an oxyethylene (-O-CH2-CH2) chain which is short enough to allow the thiolipid to become anchored to the gold surface by self-assembly, but long enough to trap an aqueous layer between the gold surface and the bottom of the thiolipid layer, said thiolipid being attached to the gold surface and said imperfect layer being completed by a phospholipid which provides an unattached fluid phase at room temperature, and (3) a second lipid layer of phospholipid. The sensor is especially useful for measuring changes in electrical resistance and/or capacity when it is prepared to contain a receptor protein and an analyte containing an agonist to the receptor is contacted with the bilayer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel membrane sensors containing an 
array of self assembling lipid molecules and to the use of such 
sensors as biosensors. A biosensor comprises a biologically sensitive material in 
intimate contact with a suitable electronic device, the 
transducer, which converts a biochemical signal generated by the 
interaction between the biologically sensitive material and the 
surrounding fluid medium, the analyte, into quantifiable or 
processable electronic or optical information. A wide variety of 
biosensitive materials have been proposed for use in biosensors of 
various kinds. Enzymes, antibodies, antigens, receptor proteins, 
whole mammalian cells or tissues have all been suggested as being 
potentially useful. However in order to incorporate these 
materials into a sensor it is necessary to immobilise them in a 
way which will allow them to interact with the analyte and 
generate a suitable signal. One class of biosensor is based on bilayer lipid membranes 
(BLMs). For a general review, see H. T. Tien etal. in "Molecular 
Electronics: Biosensors and Biocomputers", ed. F. T. Hong, Plenum 
Press, New York (1989) at pages 259-268. A sub-class of BLM 
biosensors mentioned therein is those which one face of the 
bilayer is anchored to a support while the other is in contact 
with a solution of analyte. The lipid bilayer is self-assembling, 
as the lipid molecules employed arrange themselves perpendicularly 
to the support in the manner: 
   SUPPORT: -Lipid: Lipid- 
where the symbol "-" denotes the negatively charged group, e.g. 
phosphate or acetate. The lipid bilayer contains a small number 
of biosensitive molecules. By way of illustration, PCT  
 
Application Publication No. WO 89/01159 (CSIRO) discloses BLMs 
containing a reagent providing an ion-channel, e.g. the peptide 
gramicidin. The FAb fragment of a divalent monoclonal antibody 
to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is present in the aqueous 
solution. The antibody blocks the ion-channel, but the block is 
partially released when hCG analyte is introduced into the 
aqueous solution, as demonstrated by a change in impedance. In 
these BLMs, the first layer is of dodecanethiol, the second an 
acetate lipid or phospholipid and support is a palladium-coated 
glass electrode. The thiol group provides bonding to the 
palladium surface. PCT Application Publication No. WO 90/02327 
(Australian Membrane and Biotechnology Research Insitute) relates 
to detailed modifications of the earlier work. It mentions that
