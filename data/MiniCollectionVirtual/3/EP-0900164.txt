<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a process for avoiding product dust or product gas emission when decanting using solid or liquid dosage systems. The process consists of blowing gas, particularly air, as nearly in the center of the barrel (5) as possible, before loosening the barrel (5) from a dosage device (1) having a suction system. The preferred direction of injection is vertical. The injected gas is drawn out with the product dust or product gas by the suction or aspiration pipe (4) of the suction system. With the help of the injected gas, the product dust or product gas is, so to speak, rinsed away. To carry out the process, a rinse pipe (7) is used which penetrates the cover (3) of the suction system and runs along the dosage device (1) filling pipe (8) to the lower edge of the filling pipe (8).

Method for preventing the emission of product dust or product gas in
conjunction with filling using solid or liquid metering systems, involving the

following stages:

a) Securing a drum (5) for filling a product by means of a metering
arrangement (1);
b) Creating a partial vacuum inside the drum (5) and neighbouring
components by means of an extraction device (3, 4); and
c) Filling the product into the drum (5);

whereby,

before releasing the drum (5) from the metering device (1), gas is blown
into the drum (5) via a guide ring (13) with nozzles (14) arranged

concentrically in relation to the metering arrangement and is then
extracted together with the product dust (11) generated in conjunction with

filling by means of the extraction arrangement (3, 4).
Method as claimed in Patent Claim 1, characterized in that the gas flow
(12) is blown in essentially parallel with the axis of the drum.
Method in accordance with one or other of Patent Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the gas, following extraction from the drum (5), is

filtered from the product dust (11) and is returned to the closed cycle.
Arrangement for the implementation of the method in accordance with one
or other of Patent Claims 1 to 3 with a metering arrangement (1) with a

filling pipe (8) and an extraction device comprising a covering cap (3), an
extraction pipe (4) for extracting the gas displaced from the drum (5) in

conjunction with filling and an inflatable expanding hose (6) for sealing the
drum (5) in conjunction with filling,

characterized in that

at least one flushing pipe (7, 15) is passed through the covering cap (3) of
the extraction device and/or the expanding hose (6), in conjunction with 

which it extends as far as the lower end of the filling pipe (8) into a guide
ring (13).
Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claim 4, characterized in that at
least one flushing pipe (7, 15) runs along the filling pipe (8) and/or the

expanding hose (6).
Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claims 4 or 5, characterized in
that at least one flushing pipe (7, 15) discharges into nozzles (14) of the

guide ring (13).
Arrangement in accordance with one or other of Patent Claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the passage of the flushing pipe (7, 15) through the

cover cap (3) and/or the expanding hose (6) is executed in a gas-tight
fashion.
