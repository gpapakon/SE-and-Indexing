<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agent for control 
of mites and ticks which externally parasitize animals, 
said agent containing, as an active ingredient, an oxazoline 
or thiazoline compound. Moreover, the invention relates 
to the use of said oxazoline or thiazoline compounds 
for control of house dust mites. Oxazoline or thiazoline compounds, which mainly 
target mites which parasitize crops, are disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 85268/1990 and 
232867/1991. However, there is no disclosure in the 
above publications about control effect on mites which 
live in houses or mites which parasitize large or small 
animals or birds, etc. Under the above circumstances, the object of 
this invention lies in developing a new use of some 
particular compounds among compounds which conceptionally 
included in the above official gazettes, and searching for 
compounds capable of displaying an excellent control 
effect against mites as an environmental pest among the 
selected compounds. The present inventors, for the purpose of 
fulfilling the above requisites, tested compounds 
invented as an agricultural acaricide on dust mites in 
houses and mites and ticks which parasitize livestock, 
and as a result found that these compounds show an extremely 
excellent acaricidal effect against them.  
 According to the present invention there is provided an 
acaricidal agent for control of mites and ticks which externally 
parasitize animals, said agent containing, as an 
active ingredient, an oxazoline or thiazoline compound represented 
by the following formula (I) 
 
wherein 
R1 and R2 are the same or different and each denote a 
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-C6 alkyl group, a C1-C6 
alkoxy group, a nitro group, a trifluoromethyl group or a 
trifluoromethoxy group, R3 and R4 each denote a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, 
a trifluoromethyl group, a trifluoromethoxy group, an alkyl 
group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 
1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkylthio group having 1 to 20 carbon 
atoms, a C1-C6 alkoxy-C1-C6 alkyl group, a C1-C6 alkoxy-C1-C6 
alkoxy group, an alkenyloxy group having 3 or more 
carbon atoms, a C2-C6 alkynyloxy group, a tri(C1-C6 alkyl)silyl 
group, a cycloalkyl group optionally substituted with 
a C1-C6 alkyl group or a group 
 
   wherein 
B denotes a direct bond, an oxygen atom, a C2-C6 
alkylene group, a C2-C6 alkyleneoxy group, a C2-C6 
alkylenedioxy group or a di(C1-C6 alkyl)silyl 
group,  Q denotes N, CH or CR5, n denotes an integer of 0 to 4,
