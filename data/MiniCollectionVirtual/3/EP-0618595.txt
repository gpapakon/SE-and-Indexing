<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic or electromagnetic circuit 
component includes an embedded magnetic material 

(e.g., ferromagnetic) in an HDI structure with 
alternating dielectric and metal or winding layers. 

In one embodiment, the ferromagnetic material is 
situated in a substrate well, or cavity, with or 

without an adhesive. Alternatively, the ferromagnetic 
material is co-fired with the ceramic substrate and 

then machined to achieve a required core shape. An 
electroplating process is employed to construct the 

metal layers, such process including differential 
plating for varying the thickness of metal layers 

and/or other portions of the circuit. Laser ablation 
or any other suitable technique is employed to make 

through-holes for insertion of the posts of a 
ferromagnetic core plate used to complete a magnetic 

circuit, if required. Advantageously, a magnetic or 
electromagnetic comp
onent may have a height of less 
than about 0.1 inch. Furthermore, such magnetic or 

electromagnetic circuit components allow for very low 
inductance interconnections between these components 

and other circuit elements. Moreover, in a power 
supply, for example, not only can the complete power 

supply be built using HDI technology, but power 
density is increased at relatively low cost and at a 

high level of reproducibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
magnetic circuit components (e.g., transformers, 
inductors, and coupled inductors) and electromagnetic 
circuit components (e.g., directional couplers, 
isolators, waveguides, phase-shifters and circulators) 
employing embedded magnetic material and electroplated 
or differentially electroplated metal layers or 
windings in high density interconnect (HDI) 
structures. More and more integrated circuits (IC's), 
including signal IC's and microwave IC's, are being 
constructed using high density interconnect (HDI) 
technology. As described in our US Patent No. 4,783,695, 
HDI structures offer many advantages in the compact 
assembly of, for example, digital and other electronic 
systems.  In order to completely integrate a power 
supply with HDI digital and microwave modules, it is 
desirable to be able to construct the power supply, 
including magnetic components, using the same 
technology, i.e., HDI. In order to build magnetic 
components in an HDI structure, the height of the 
magnetic component must be very small, e.g., less than 
about 0.1 inch. Such thin magnetic components 
generally require multi-pole core structures, such as 
described in our US Patent No. 5,126,715. In addition to lumped magnetic components, 
it is also desirable to be able to construct 
distributed electromagnetic circuit components using 
HDI technology for integration in, for example, HDI 
microwave modules. A magnetic or electromagnetic circuit 
component comprises an embedded magnetic material 
(e.g., ferromagnetic) in an HDI structure with 
alternating dielectric and metal or winding layers. 
In one embodiment, the ferromagnetic material is 
situated in a substrate well, or cavity, with or 
without an adhesive. Alternatively, the ferromagnetic  
 
material is co-fired with the ceramic substrate and 
then machined to achieve a required core shape. An 
electroplating process is employed to construct the 
metal layers, such process including differential 
plating for varying the thickness of metal layers 
and/or other portions of the circuit. Laser ablation 
or any other suitable technique is employed to make 
through-holes for insertion of the posts of a 
ferromagnetic core plate used to complete a magnetic 
circuit, if required. Advantageously, a magnetic or 
electromagnetic component built according to the 
present invention may have a height of less than about 
0.1 inch. Furthermore, using magnetic or 
electromagnetic circuit components constructed
