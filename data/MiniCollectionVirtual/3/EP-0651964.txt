A vacuum cleaner has a motor housing (2) and a hose (8), which can be 
coupled 
via
 two mains-voltage wires (38, 42), one communication wire (48) and 
contacts (32, 34, 30). The motor housing (2) and the handle (10) of the hose (8) include 

microprocessors (6, 12) which communicate with one another 
via
 the communication 
wire (48). The signal earth (26) of the one microprocessor (6) is connected to the one 

mains voltage terminal (18) and the signal earth (44) of the other microprocessor (12) is 
connected to the other mains voltage terminal (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vacuum cleaner comprising:
a first functional unit, and a second functional unit which can be coupled electrically to
the first functional unit;which first functional unit comprises a first mains voltage terminal and a second mains
voltage terminal for receiving an alternating mains voltage, and a first data processing
unit having a first reference terminal and a first communication terminal;which second functional unit comprises a first mains voltage terminal and a second
mains voltage terminal for receiving the alternating mains voltage, and a second data
processing unit having a second reference terminal and a second communication
terminal;which first mains voltage terminal of the first functional unit can be coupled to the first
mains voltage terminal of the second functional unit via a first mains voltage wire and a
first mains voltage contact;which second mains voltage terminal of the first functional unit can be coupled to the
second mains voltage terminal of the second functional unit via a second mains voltage
wire and a second mains voltage contact; and which first communication terminal can be coupled to the second communication
terminal via a communication wire and a communication contact.  Such a vacuum cleaner is known from United States Patent No.
4,654,924. This known vacuum cleaner comprises three functional units, i.e. a motor
housing, a hose with a handle and a suction nozzle. The controls are arranged on the
handle, which for this purpose includes control buttons for activating various functions
of the vacuum cleaner. The handle further includes an indicator device or display screen
to give various indications about the operating condition of the vacuum cleaner. For a
correct operation of the system the motor housing and the handle include data
processing units which should be capable of communicating with one another. A suction
nozzle can be attached to the hose, which nozzle comprises a rotating brush driven by
an electric motor which is powered by the alternating mains voltage. The suction nozzle 
also accommodates a data processing unit which communicates with the data processing
unit in the handle. In order to provide data communication between the handle, the
motor housing and the suction nozzle and to supply mains voltage to the electric motor
of the brush the functional units can be coupled by means of three wires. Therefore, the
hose is provided with three wires, a first and a second mains voltage wire for mains
voltage supply and a communication
