<ABSTRACT>
The optical mixer (1) according to the invention contains as mixing element a polarisation-maintaining piece of optical fibre (4). The pumping light (P) is coupled in such that its plane of polarisation encloses an angle of 45 DEG  with the principal axes of the piece of optical fibre (4). An advantage of this optical mixer (1) is that the optical power of the mixed product (11) is dependent not on the polarisation of the signal light (S) but only on the phase relationship between signal light and pumping light. One advantageous use is an optical phase control loop.

Use of an optical mixer (1) in an optical phase-locked
loop comprising a length of polarization-maintaining

optical waveguide (4) as a mixing element and a coupler
(2) for coupling signal light (S) and pump light (P) into

a first end (10) of the length of optical waveguide (4),
from whose second end (11) emerge the signal light (S),

the pump light (P), and a mixing product (M) thereof, the
pump light (P), which is plane-polarized, being coupled

into the length of optical waveguide (4) in such a way

that its plane of polarization makes an angle of
approximately 45° with the principal axes of the length

of optical waveguide (4).
Use of an optical mixer (1) as claimed in claim 1
wherein in a control section (21, 27, 28, 5, 22, 23, 24,

25), an electric control signal (D) for an optical clock
generator (26) is derived from light emerging from the

optical mixer (1), which is composed of the signal light
(S), the pump light (P), and the mixing product (M), said

electric control signal (D) corresponding to an intensity
difference between the signal light (S) contained

in the output light of the optical mixer (1) and the
mixing product (M) contained in the signal light, and

wherein a portion of the optical clock signal emitted by
the optical clock generator (26) is fed as the pump light

(P) to the optical mixer (1). 
Use of an optical mixer (1) as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that
 the second end (11) of the length
of optical waveguide (4) is connected to an optical

filter (5) which blocks the signal light (S) and the pump
light (P).

An optical phase-locked loop comprising an optical
clock generator (26), an optical mixer (1) comprising a

length of polarization-maintaining optical waveguide (4)
as a mixing element and a coupler (2) for coupling signal

light (S) and pump light (P) into a first end (10) of the
length of optical waveguide (4), from whose second end

(11) emerge the signal light (S), the pump light (P), and
a mixing product (M) thereof, the pump light (P), which

is plane-polarized, being coupled into the length of
optical waveguide (4) in such a way that its plane of

polarization makes an angle of approximately 45° with the
principal axes of the length of optical waveguide (4),

and a control section (21, 27, 28, 5, 22, 23, 24, 25)
which converts light emerging from the optical mixer (1)

and composed of signal light (S), pump light (P), and a
mixing product (M) into an electric control signal (D) 

corresponding to an intensity difference between the
signal light (S) and the mixing product (M), the optical

clock generator (26), which is controlled by the control
signal (D), being connected to the optical mixer (1), so

that the latter receives a portion of the optical clock
signal as the pump light (P).
