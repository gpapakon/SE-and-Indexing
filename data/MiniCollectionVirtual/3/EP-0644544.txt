<ABSTRACT>
In a decoder for decoding a serial data stream, 
employing an extracted base clock signal, synchronous 

with an input, coded, serial data stream, a fractionary 
frequency clock signal for sampling a decoded output 

data stream and a second fractionary clock signal for 
synthesizing a pre-decoded value produced by a first 

combinative logic network within a second combinative 
logic network to produce a decoded value that is sent 

to an output sampling flip-flop, a pipelined operation 
is implemented by momentarily storing the bits that are 

processed in the second combinative logic network and 
by anticipating of two full cycles of the synchronous 

base clock the processing by said first combinative 
network of the n-number of bits handled by the decoder. 

Each one of the two combinative logic networks is 
permitted to complete its decoding process within a 

full clock cycle in advance of the raising front of the 
outpunt sampling clock signal. With the same 

fabrication technology and therefore with the same 
propagation delay of the two combinative logic 

networks, the maximum operating spead may be doubled. A 
limited number of additional components are required to 

implement the pipelined operation of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to a decoder for
serial data transfer channels, for example from
peripherals to a CPU and viceversa. The invention is
particularly useful for read/write channels of a mass
memory system, such as for example a hard disk system.In mass memory supports, such as for example hard
disks, floppy disks, CD, tape streamers and similar,
digital data are stored by physically recording on the
support only the "1", spaced among each other along a
magnetic track by segments, the length of which is
proportional to the number of "0" present between two
successive "1". Considerations on the dynamic characteristics
of revolving or winding supports, impose a
minimum distance between adjacent "1", because if any
two successive "1" would be physically recorded one
close to the other on the support, interference between
the two recorded "peaks" could cause indeterminations
and errors during reading due to a practical limitation
of the discriminating capacity of reading pick-ups.
Moreover, another peculiarity of these mass storing
systems is represented by the fact that the sampling
clock signal that is used in the write/read channels
circuitry cannot be derived by a system's clock (e.g.
by frequency division), but necessarily has to be a
synchronous clock signal that is derived directly from
the serial data stream, the "speed" of which may often
vary. For example, in the case of a hard disk, data
recorded on outer circular tracks may be written and
read at a higher speed than data written and read on
inner circular tracks.In general, in this as in many other applications, a 
variable frequency clock signal, synchronous with the
serial streams of data, is generated by detecting the
succession of transitions of a coded pulse stream that
represents a succession of digital data, for example by
employing a common phase-locked circuit (TLL),
cooperating with a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).Where there is the necessity of generating a
variable frequency, synchronous time base signal (i.e.
synchronous base clock signal), there may be also a
practical limit to the maximum "distance" between any
two successively recorded "1", because if a transition
could occur after an excessively long period of time
from a preceding transition, the synchronism of the
self-generated clock frequency, "locked" to the pulse
stream, could be lost, thus introducing, also in this
case, indeterminations of the correct sampling instant
and therefore errors during reading.These "dynamic" limitations are commonly overcome
