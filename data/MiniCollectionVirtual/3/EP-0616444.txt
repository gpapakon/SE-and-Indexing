<ABSTRACT>
Telecommunication systems such as PON-FITL-Systems are known with a 
TDMA frame structure comprising a main station and a number of substations. The 

known systems can comprise means for coarse ranging and means for fine ranging. The 
present invention proposes improved Pseudo Noise Sequence based coarse ranging 

means. According to the present invention coarse ranging is done at a fixed position 
(CR) within the upstream multiframe (up) reserved for ranging, preferably for fine 

ranging. By applying a low power Pseudo Noise Sequence (rseq) for coarse ranging and 
sampling the range at the side of the main station only within the fine ranging window 

(CR), the position of which is known to the main station, a more accurate coarse 

ranging is achieved. The present invention is based upon the insight that within the fine 
ranging window normally no data are present, and thus the signal-to-interference ratio is 

an order of magnitude better than in the other part of the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunication system comprising a 
main station and a plurality of substations, in which system communication between the 
main station and the substations occurs via a transmission channel on the basis of a 
multiple access protocol, which channel is at least partially common to the substations, 
for the sake of coarse ranging the substations being provided with ranging transmission 
means for transmitting a low magnitude ranging sequence with respect to the magnitude 
of data to be transmitted in time slots, and the main station being provided with 
correlation means for recovering ranging information by correlating a received ranging 
sequence with a reference sequence being identical to the transmitted sequence, the main 
station being provided with means for providing the reference sequence. Depending on 
the transmission channel used, i.e. a glass fibre, a coaxial cable or a radio link, the 
telecommunication system can be a passive optical network (PON), a local area 
network, a satellite communication system or a cellular mobile radio system. The present invention further relates to a main station for use in such a 
system. A telecommunication system of this kind is known from the article, "Burst 
and bit synchronization methods for passive optical networks", C.A. Eldering et a., 4th 
Workshop on Optical Local Networks, IEEE, Sep. 24, 25 1992, Versailles, France, pp. 
38-44. In the article various synchronization techniques are described, such as burst 
synchronization or coarse ranging, such synchronization being necessary to prevent 
substations from interfering each other due to non-synchronized operation, i.e. it is to 
be prevented that data transmitted from the substations to the main station do not arrive 
at the main station simultaneously. In the known telecommunication system, an optical 
network, the main station may transmit data and messages in time slots within a frame 
to the substations, in the downstream direction, in a controlled way, i.e. the main 
station or master has full control over the timing of the data to be transmitted to the  
 
various substations. In the upstream direction, from the substations to the main stations 
the most commonly technique is a Time Division Multiple Access Technique (TDMA), 
which requires that the delays between the substations and the main station be known 
and that a suitable delay be incorporated in the transmission from each substation so that 
the burst transmissions arrive at the specified or
