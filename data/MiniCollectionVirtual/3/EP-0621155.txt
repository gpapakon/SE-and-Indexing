<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for indicating to a driver 
of a vehicle (1) the grip of the travelling vehicle on a road 

surface. The method comprises determining the revolutions of 
a driven wheel (7), determining the revolutions of a free-running 

wheel (8) and generating and providing to the driver a 
signal corresponding with the difference between these 

revolutions. The invention further relates to a vehicle (1) 
comprising a chassis and a number of wheels (7,8) mounted on the 

chassis. At least one of the wheels is driven by a drive 
device (3) supported by the chassis and at least one wheel is a 

free-running wheel. Revolution sensors (13,15) are coupled to the 
driven wheel (7) and the free-running wheel (8) and coupled to the 

revolution sensors (13,15) and an output device (18) is a processing 
device which defines a revolution difference value and 

activates the output device in accordance with this value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for indicating to 
a driver of a vehicle the grip of the travelling vehicle on 
a road surface. For safe use of a vehicle it is desirable that the 
driver adapts his driving style and driving speed to the 
conditions. An important factor herein is the grip of the 
vehicle on the road surface. When this grip decreases the 
driver must make allowance for a longer braking distance and 
it would in general be advisable to maintain a lower speed. 
A driver receives a limited amount of information concerning 
the grip of his vehicle on the road surface via the steering 
wheel. When grip is reduced the steering forces will in 
general be smaller. In order to be able to utilize this information well 
the driver must know the vehicle very well and in particular 
know what the normal steering forces are in order to be able 
to recognize differing, lesser steering forces. Moreover, 
when driving in a straight line such information is not, or 
practically not, available. The invention therefore has for its object to 
provide a method with which the driver receives a useful 
indication of the grip of the vehicle. With the method according to the invention this is 
achieved in that the revolutions of a driven wheel are 
determined, the revolutions of a free-running wheel are 
determined and a signal corresponding to the difference 
between these revolutions is provided to the driver. When grip of the vehicle on the road surface is 
reduced the driven wheel will display greater slip than the 
free-running wheel. The signal corresponding to the 
difference between these revolutions is thus an indication  
 
for the grip of the vehicle on the road surface. When in 
otherwise unchanged conditions, for example when driving in 
a straight line at constant speed, the value of the signal 
increases, the driver receives the indication that the grip 
of his vehicle on the road surface is decreasing and he can 
adapt his speed and driving style. The signal thus gives an 
indication of for example less skid resistance of the road 
surface and/or a greater unevenness, whereby a less good 
wheel-road surface contact results. The signal will of course vary with, among other 
things, the power transmitted by the driven wheel onto the 
road surface. The driver will however rapidly develop 
sufficient experience to be able to interpret the signal and 
in particular to be able to determine whether the indicated 
value of the signal is normal, favourable or precisely 
unfavourable. According to a
