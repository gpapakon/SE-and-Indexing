<ABSTRACT>
A highly active ZSM-5 zeolite has an irregular ZSM-5 
type crystal structure depleted of some of forming 

elements in a lowly active ZSM-5 zeolite having a regular 
ZSM-5 type crystal structure. The single-lattice volume 

V₁ determined from crystal lattice constants by an X-ray 
diffraction for the irregular ZSM-5 crystal structure is 

in a relationship of V₁ 
<
 V₂ with a single-lattice volume 
V₂ determined from crystal lattice constants by an X-ray 

diffraction for the regular ZSM-5 crystal structure. This 
is attributable to the fact that a relationship ofβ 
>
 α 
is established between Si-O-Si bond angles α and β in 

the regular and irregular ZSM-5 type crystal structures. 
Such a highly active ZSM-5 zeolite has a high activity 

and a high heat-resisting temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst composition for internal combustion engine exhaust gas conversion comprising a highly active
ZSM-5 zeolite, its use and a process for producing the same.Within this specification, the characterisations "lowly active" and "highly active" denote ZSM-5 zeolite starting material and a ZSM-5 zeolite modified by at least an acid treatment, respectively.Furthermore, the characterisations "irregular" and "regular" ZSM-5 type crystal structure are intended to denote the corresponding crystal structures in said modified and starting material ZSM-5 zeolites, respectively.The term "single-lattice volume" is intended to denote the unit all volume of said crystal structures.Conventionally, a ZSM-5 zeolite has been regarded
as a noteworthy material because of its capability of
purifying an exhaust gas, thermal stability and the like,
and various results of studies about them have been
presented (for example, see Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open No.126941/90).However, the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite suffers from
a problem that its activity is relatively low and is
deteriorated in a short time, if it is exposed to an
exhaust gas having a high temperature because its heat
resistance is poor.Such a low heat resistance of the ZSM-5 zeolite is
due to its crystal structure and also due to a following
fact: oxides, hydroxides, various salts and the like
including alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are
used as starting materials for preparing the ZSM-5
zeolite, and for this reason, when the ZSM-5 zeolite is
exposed to a high temperature, for example, sodium (Na)
contained in the starting material reacts with water of  
crystallization of the ZSM-5 zeolite to produce sodium
hydroxide or oxide which causes aluminum forming a three-dimensional
skeleton structure of the ZSM-5 zeolite to be
eluted, resulting in a destructed three-dimensional
skeleton structure.There is conventionally known exhaust emission
control devices in which a hydrocarbon adsorber including
a zeolite is disposed in an exhaust system upstream of an
exhaust emission control catalyst to provide an
improvement in conversion of hydrocarbons (HCs) contained
in an exhaust gas having a low temperature immediately
after the start of an engine (for example, see Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No.75327/90). Further, there
are conventionally known ZSM-5 zeolites having a metal
such as copper (Cu) or the like carried therein by an ion
exchange process to provide an improvement in conversion
of NOX resulting from
