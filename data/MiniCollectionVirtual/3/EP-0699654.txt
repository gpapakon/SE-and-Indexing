<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic electro luminescence device containing a hole-transporting
material having an aromatic amine structure.Organic photoconductive materials developed as
photosensitive materials or hole-transporting materials are
advantageous in many points, that is, they are less
expensive, processable in a variety of forms and free of
pollution, and many compounds have been proposed so far. As
organic photoconductive materials, for example, U. S.

Patent 3,257,203 discloses oxazole derivatives; U. S. Patent

hydrazone derivatives; U. S. Patent 3,820,989, JP-A-51-93224
and JP-A-55-108667 disclose triarylpyrazoline derivatives;

and JP-A-56-119132 disclose arylamine derivatives;
and JP-A-58-190953 and JP-A-59-195658 disclose stilbene
derivatives.An organic EL device is one of examples using a
hole-transporting material. An EL device using an organic
substance is overwhelmingly expected to be usable as a solid
light-emitting inexpensive large-screen full-color display 
device, and developments of many kinds of devices are under
way. Generally, an EL device is composed of a light-emitting
layer and a pair of mutually opposite electrodes
sandwiching the light-emitting layer. Light emission is the
following phenomenon. When an electric field is applied to
these two electrodes, electrons are injected into the
light-emitting layer from a cathode side and holes are
injected into the light-emitting layer from an anode side.
When the electrons recombine with the holes in the light-emitting
layer, their energy level comes back to a valence
bond band. At this time, the electrons release energy as
light.As compared with inorganic EL devices,
conventional organic EL devices require high actuation
voltage, and their light emission brightness and light
emission efficiency are low. Further, conventional organic
EL devices deteriorate in properties to a great extent, and
no organic EL device has been put to practical use.In recent year, there is proposed an organic EL
device which is produced by layering a thin film containing
an organic compound having a fluorescent quantum effect so
that it can emit light at a low voltage as low as less than
10 V, and it attracts attention (Appl. Phy. Lett., Vol. 51,
page 913, 1987).The above organic EL device has a fluorescent
material layer formed of a metal chelate complex and a
hole-i
