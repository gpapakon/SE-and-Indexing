<ABSTRACT>
A process for bulk conversion of a solid polycrystalline ceramic body 
to a single crystal body which comprises heating only a portion of said 

polycrystalline ceramic body with a localized energy source, without 
melting the entire said polycrystalline ceramic body, at a temperature 

and for a time sufficient to convert said polycrystalline ceramic body 
to said single crystal body. 
In one embodiment of the invention, a dense polycrystalline alumina 
(PCA) article is converted to sapphire via a solid state conversion 

process. 
A CO₂ laser energy source has been successfully employed as a 
localized energy source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid state process 
for converting a polycrystalline alumina article to 
sapphire using a localized energy source, such as a 
laser, applied to only a portion of the article. The manufacture of polycrystalline alumina (PCA), 
and its use for high pressure sodium arc discharge 
lamps (hereinafter "HPS lamps") is well known and old 
to those skilled in the art. U.S. Patents 3,026,210; 
4,150,317 and 4,285,732 to Coble, Laska et al and 
Charles et al, disclose the production of a high 
density PCA body having improved visible light 
transmission using relatively pure alumina powder and 
small amounts of magnesia. U.S. Patent 4,285,732 
further teaches adding zirconia and hafnia to the 
magnesia-doped alumina to reduce the chances of 
precipitating a spinel phase and exaggerated or run 
away grain growth during sintering. PCA bodies useful 
as arc tubes for HPS lamps have been made according to 
the processes in these patents having an average grain 
size ranging from between 15 microns to 100 microns. Two major drawbacks associated with the use of PCA 
arc tubes for HPS lamps are that they are light 
translucent as opposed to light transparent and the 
sodium in the arc reacts with the alumina at the grain 
boundaries to form sodium aluminate, which shortens  
 
lamp life. HPS lamps are being designed for ever 
increasing internal sodium partial pressure within the 
PCA arc tube to improve the color rendition and provide 
a whiter emitted light. However, higher internal 
sodium pressure further shortens lamp life due to 
increased rate of sodium loss from the arc chamber. 
Progressive sodium loss results in a continual rise in 
the lamp operating voltage, decrease of both correlated 
color temperature and color rendering index, and a 
color shift from white to pink. Also, the sodium which 
migrates through the arc chamber wall deposits on the 
inside wall of the evacuated outer lamp envelope 
causing a brownish stain on the envelope which, in 
turn, further reduces the light output of the lamp. 
These problems are substantially reduced with sapphire 
(i.e., single crystal alumina) arc tubes. Sapphire arc tubes useful as the arc chamber for 
HPS lamps have been made by a number of processes, 
including a modified Czochralski process known as the 
edge-defined, film-fed growth or (EFG) process 
developed by Tyco Laboratories, Inc. This process uses 
a seed crystal and a die on the surface of molten 
alumina where a hollow tube is continuously pulled out 
of the melt through the
