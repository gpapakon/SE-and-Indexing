<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a method to provide for persons (2) travelling by a vehicle (5) a display of pictures, movies, or other display information (1) on an intended display area outside of said vehicle on a tunnel wall (6) or other surface suitable for this, which surface laterally delimits an intended path (8) for said vehicle, for example a tunnel for a train, a bus, a boat etc. from a display apparatus movable along said path, preferably completed with sound transmission to the interior of the vehicle. A number of LCD plates or the equivalent are used, which are arranged at the area of and/or adjacent to vehicle windows (13), in order to provide by influence of light (23) from at least one side of said plates, external picture display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method to provided 
for persons travelling by a vehicle a display of pictures, 
movies, video, television broadcasting or other display information 
on an intended display area outside of said vehicle 
on a tunnel wall or other surface suitable for this, which 
surface laterally delimits an intended path for said vehicle, 
for example a tunnel for a train, a bus, a boat etc. from a 
display apparatus movable along said path, preferably completed 
with sound transmission to the interior of the vehicle. It is known to provide display of pictures, movies, 
information, advertising, etc., outside windows of vehicles on 
special display boards in tunnels along tracks, roads and 
similar paths, through for example US-A-978 854; US-A-4 179 
198 and DE-C2-3 105 820. However said known picture display 
system operates separated from said vehicle. Only light from 
the vehicle is required to achieve the picture display. The 
environment in which these picture display apparatus are 
mounted does not constitute the most suitable for such picture 
display apparatus, that is dirty, damp, cold, vibratory etc. It is also known through FR-A-2 120 243 by means of 
projectors to provide display of pictures on tunnel walls at 
a low level at the side of the vehicle. A picture which can be 
seen through the window by the passengers thereby would be 
difficult to achieve. Further the quality of the pictures, which up to now 
have been possible to show along vehicle paths, has not been 
so good that one could be able to view them continuously 
without become tired. It is also known to show movies and pictures etc., 
to passengers on boats, trains and so on, in a traditional way 
operating with transmission of a display picture from a projector 
to a display screen on board the vehicle etc. For 
passengers who travel by vehicles, which traffic long tunnels 
with various paths therein, e.g. underground, for said passengers 
there is not very much to look at except for staring  
 
at each other, when they are not reading newspapers, books etc. Information to the passengers is also limited to 
signs inside the vehicles alternatively small electronic 
displays located in the carriages as well. Thus, there is a great need to be able to inform the 
passengers about miscellaneous concerning the journey, line 
extensions, time tables, vehicle changes, delays, traffic 
information and so on and also to show advertising, movies, 
news etc. The main object of the present invention is therefore 
at first

<CLAIMS>
A method to provide for persons (2) travelling 
by a vehicle (5) a display of pictures, movies, video, television 

broadcasting or other display information (1) on an 
intended display area (3) outside (4) of said vehicle (5) on a 

tunnel wall (6) or other surface suitable for this, which 
surface laterally (7) delimits an intended path (8) for said 

vehicle (5), for example a tunnel (20) for a train, a bus, a 
boat etc. from a display apparatus (9) movable along said path 

(8), preferably completed with sound transmission to the interioer 
of the vehicle (11), 
characterized therein
 that a number 
of LCD-plates (12) or the equivalent are used, which are 

arranged at the area of and/or adjacent to vehicle windows (13), 
in order to create by influence of light (23) from an least one 

side of said plates (12) a projector which provides external 
picture display, and that means to reduce the so called keystone 

effect of a picture shown is used in the form of tilting the 
relevant LCD-plates (12) or the equivalent and/or by neutralizing picture 

distorsion by prerotating the picture by a digital electronic 
method at mixing of pre-recorded material or in the control unit 

of the projectors or in the video circuit in respective LCD-plate. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
therein
 that recorded material is projected, or directly transmitted material 
from the vehicle is projected, or centrally transmitted 

material controlled by control means (16) acting along the 
vehicle path (8) is projected. 
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized 
therein
 that a so called bar code system is used for 
reading of bar code information (17) located along the path (8).  

 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
therein
 that said plates (12) are illuminate (34) from 
the opposite side so that pictures are projected on a back 

projection screen inside in the vehicle, placed e.g. above the 
window (13) and/or included in the window structure, e.g. 

inserted between window layers. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
therein
 that the intended surface along the tunnel wall (6) is 
treated by thread formed web (6A), which is sprayed out to cover 

existing Installation (50) forming a display surface. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
therein
 that the picture (1) shown is provided with a 
preferably white frame (22) covering a certain part of the 

periphery edge of the picture field, by digitally mixing with 
intended picture material in a control unit or in the video 

circuit of said place. 
Means to carry out a method 
according to any of claims 1 to 6, 


characterized therein
 that a number of 
LCD-plates (12) or the equivalent are used, which are arranged 

at the area of and/or adjacent, preferably above vehicle windows 
(13), that said plates (12) from at least one of its sides (14) 

can be influenced by means of lamps (31) or other light source 
for through illumination of the plates (12) to achieve an intended 

picture (1) at least externally of the vehicle, and that the 
plates (12) in question are settable to tilt or that means is  

 
present to prerotate intended pictures digitally, electronically 

by mixing of recorded material e.g. by the control unit of the 
projectors or in the video circuit of said plates. 
Means according to claim 7, 
characterized 
therein
 that the plates (12) in question are connected to a 
picture transmission unit (29) for recorded material, for 

example stored on a picture CD-disc, and/or material, that is 
transmitted from said vehicle (5), for example from a driver 

and/or material that is transmitted from a command/communication 
central, for example by transmitters along the path (8), from a 

so called leaking cable, and that at least on one side (14) of 
said plates (12) a main light source (31) is present, preferably 

a lamp and necessary optics (36).
