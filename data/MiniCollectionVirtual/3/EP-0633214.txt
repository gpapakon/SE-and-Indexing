<ABSTRACT>
In a curveless rail system for the rope-hauled carriage of a static inclined lift, two U-sections 1 form the running rails; the webs of the U-sections are bored at the same pitch in the longitudinal direction. Box-shaped frames 2, consisting of two U-sections bored at the same pitch in the longitudinal direction and of cross beams welded to the U-sections, are bolted at any point to the running rails 1 at the spacing distance. Attachment frames serve to attach further running-rail pairs 1; central frames are placed between one and the same running-rail pair 1. The rail construction is supported on foundations 5 via a single fixed bearing 3 and any number of movable bearings 4. All connections to be made between the elements 1 to 5 of the rail system upon assembly of the same are bolted. The rail system constructed according to the modular construction principle is flexurally and torsionally rigid, is suitable, among other things, for self projection and assembly, and can be adapted within wide limits to possible locations on a slope: To bridge a span of excessive length, the central frames are placed closer. The largely freely selectable angle of inclination can in the meantime be changed positively or negatively. Different gauges are possible. Short to medium-length inclined lifts are equipped with a rope winch; longer inclined lifts are given a revolving rope drive.

A curveless rail assembly for guiding a carriage of a
stationary inclined elevator, comprising:


a pair of two U-shaped first profiles (1) arranged
symmetrically and forming a rail, each having two legs (1
1
)
facing in opposite directions and a web (1
2
) integrally coupling
said two legs to each other, each said web having a plurality of

holes in the longitudinal direction with equal spacings (T)
therein;
a plurality of frames (2) arranged between said first U-shaped
profiles (1) and for determining the gauge (S) of the

rail, each of said frames (2) comprising a pair of U-shaped
second profiles (2
1
) arranged symmetrically and each having two
second legs (2
11
) facing in the same direction and second webs
(2
12
) integrally coupling said two second legs to each other, and
at least two transverse bars (2
2
) for coupling said second webs
to each other, each of said second webs having holes in the

longitudinal direction with the same spacing (T) therein and
abutting against one associated of said first webs (1
2
) of the U-shaped
first profiles (1),
a plurality of bearings, consisting of a fixed bearing (3)
pivotably engaging one of said frames (2) and at least one

floating bearing (4) engaging one of said frames (2) and
permitting a longitudinal movement, whereby the bearings (3, 4)

are mounted along a predetermined line of inclination (N) on
foundations (5), whereby the connections
between the U-shaped first profiles (1) forming the rail and
the associated frames (2),
between the frames (2) and the associated bearings (3, 4) and
between the bearings (3, 4) and the associated foundations (5)
are detachable connections.
A rail assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said
detachable connections are screwed connections.
A rail assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
pairs of said first U-shaped profiles (1) forming the rails have

a fixed length (L
1
) and wherein splice frames (2'') are provided
to join a further pair of rails (1) with the same fixed length

(L
1
), respectively.
A rail assembly as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein
said transverse bars at the frames (2) are tubes (2
2
).
A rail assembly as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
said frames positioned in the middle portion of the rails (1)

(central frames 2') have three of said holes spaced
equidistantly (T) in a longitudinal direction of said U-shaped

profiles (2
1
).
A rail assembly as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
said second frames (splice frames 2'') on the end of the rails

(1) have four of said holes in the U-shaped profiles (2
1
) spaced
in a longitudinal direction of said second rails, two of said

holes closest to said longitudinal center of said second rails
being spaced from each other at a distance substantially equal

to twice (2U) the length of a said longitudinal end projection
(U) to compensate for the projecting end (U) at the ends of the

first U-shaped profiles (1) forming the rails and wherein the
border pairs of holes are shifted in the longitudinal direction

with the spacing (T).
A rail assembly as claimed in claim 4, wherein said fixed
bearing (3) engages pivotably at least one of said tubes (2
2
) of
a frame (2). 
A rail assembly as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, wherein
each said floating bearing (4) comprises a cross tube (4
13
) and
two angle brackets (4
3
), rotatably attached to said cross tube
(4
13
), each of said two angle brackets (4
3
) slidably engaging one
said lower leg (2
11
) of each of said second U-shaped profile (2
1
).
A rail assembly as claimed in claim 8, wherein a height of
each of said second U-shaped profiles (2
1
) of the frames (2) is
smaller by a predetermined dimension than a height of each of

said first U-shaped profiles (1) forming the rails, wherein
rails (1) and frames (2) are screwed in the middle at their webs

12

1

and 2
12
