<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
shell-shaped packages, in particular flower sleeves, in which 

two superposed bands of synthetic material are supplied and 
machined through die cutting, in such a manner that at least 

one edge of each package, defining the wide opening, is formed 
along an ornamental line (6), whereafter the material bands are 

cut in transverse direction (11,12) into separate package portions (10), 
the discrete package portions being joined together at the cut 

edges (11,12) so as to form the package, wherein, during the die 
cutting of the longitudinal edges of the material bands, both 

material bands are perforated through and through in one die 
cutting operation so as to form suspension portions (15) joined to 

the package portions via perforated lines (6) extending along an 
ornamental contour, the suspension portion formed by the 

perforation, of one of the two material bands being removed. 
The invention further relates to an apparatus for carrying out 

the method, and to the package obtained by the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method as set forth in the 
preamble of claim 1. Such a method is disclosed in European patent 
specification 0 369 549. The drawback of the prior art method is that the material 
bands, before the longitudinal edges thereof are machined, 
must be separated by means of a separating element, such as 
for instance a plate or board, in connection with the fact 
that the edges of the packages that define the wide opening 
are to be machined in different manners so as to obtain a 
package that is simple to open. Another disadvantage of the prior art method is that two 
pairs of cutting dies are necessary to machine the material 
bands, viz. one pair on one side of the separating element and 
one pair on the other side of the separating element. Such 
cutting dies are subject to wear, so that they must be 
replaced regularly, which is particularly costly. One object of the present invention is to provide a simple 
and hence economically practicable method of manufacturing 
shell-shaped packages tapering from a wide opening, these 
packages, at the wide opening thereof, being provided with 
edges following an ornamental contour and these wide opening 
edges being readily openable. To that end, the method of the present invention is 
characterized by the features set forth in the characterizing 
clause of claim 1.  
 The method of the present invention provides the advantage 
that half the required number of punches or perforators 
suffice and that, moreover, the separation of the material 
bands during the manufacture of the shell-shaped packages can 
be omitted. In spite of the fact that the present method can 
be practiced with simpler means, and hence at considerably 
lower cost, the package obtained yet has the advantage that it 
can be readily opened by the user, just like the package 
disclosed in European patent specification 0 369 549. The 
present invention is based on the insight that for the package 
to be easy to open, it is not required that the opening edge 
of one package portion project relative to the opening edge of 
the other package portion; that, however, for the package to 
be easy to open, it is sufficient for the package portions to 
project relative to each other at the opening edges, which 
themselves may be in alignment. Such is the case in the 
package obtained by the method of the invention by virtue of 
the feature that the suspension portion of one package portion 
of the shell-shaped package is removed. Although the wide 
opening edges of the package

of the material bands (1, 1a), both material bands (1, 1a) are 
perforated through and through in one die cutting operation 

applied to the material bands (1, 1a) from one material band 
surface side, so as to form suspension portions (15, 15a) 

connected with the package portions (10, 10a) through
