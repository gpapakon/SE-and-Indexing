<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a piece of furniture, forming a supporting structure (1) made of cylindrical elements, with at least one docking element (2) having a sleeve (5) and intended for connection to one or more tubular extension elements (8'), it being possible for each extension element (8') to be fastened, via a coaxial and substantially cylindrical connecting element (7'), radially to the sleeve (5). In order to achieve, in the case of furniture, a variety of individual adaptation possibilities with little manufacturing expenditure and effort of assembly and nevertheless high stability, it is proposed that the connecting element be designed as a connecting stud (7') whose greatest diameter (7a') is smaller than the inside diameter of the extension element (8'), and the extension element (8') be fully fittable coaxially onto the connecting stud (7') and be releasibly connectable to the latter, the connecting stud (7') being screwed directly onto the sleeve (5) via a fastening screw, preferably a hexagon socket screw (19'), which passes through the connecting stud (7') axially and cooperates with a threaded bore (16) in the wall (29) of the sleeve (5).

<CLAIMS>
Furniture with a supporting frame (1) made up of cylindrical 
elements, with at least one plug-on element (2) having a sleeve (5) for 

connection to one or more tubular extension elements (8'), a respective 
extension element (8') being secured radially to the sleeve (5) through a 

coaxial and substantially cylindrical connecting element (7'), 

characterised in that
 the connecting element is in the form of a 
connecting pin (7') of which the maximum diameter (7a') is less than the 

inside diameter of the extension element (8') and the extension 
element (8') fits onto it as a whole and is detachably connected to the 

connecting pin (7'), the connecting pin (7') being screwed directly onto 
the sleeve (5) through an attachment screw, preferably a hexagon socket 

screw (19'), extending axially through the connecting pin (7') and cooperating 
with a threaded bore (16) in the wall (29) of the sleeve (5). 
Furniture according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
connecting pin (7') has a face (27') curved concavely to match the 

diameter (5a) of the sleeve (5) in the region of connection to the 
sleeve (5). 
Furniture according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
extension element (8') is joined directly on to the sleeve (5) and has a 

face (41) concavely curved to match the diameter (5a) of the sleeve (5) in 
the region of connection to the sleeve (5). 
Furniture with a supporting frame (1) made up of cylindrical 
elements, with at least one plug-on element (2) having a sleeve (5) for 

connection to one or more tubular extension elements (8), the plug-on 
element (2) having at least one hollow cylindrical spigot (6) secured  

 
radially to the sleeve (5) in a detachable manner, the diameter (6a) of the 

spigot being less than the diameter (5a) of the sleeve (5) and its axis (6') 
extending substantially perpendicular to the axis (5') of the sleeve, the 

face (22) of the spigot (6) being concavely curved to match the 
diameter (5a) of the sleeve (5) in the region of connection to the 

sleeve (5) and having a central bore (23) breaking through it, and the 
wall (29) of the sleeve (5) having in the region of the axis (6') of the 

spigot (6) an attachment bore (16) for receiving an attachment screw (19) 
which passes axially through the spigot (6), as well as having a connecting 

element (7), coaxial with the respective spigot (6) and detachably 
connected to it, for connection to a tubular extension element (8) 


characterised in that
 the connecting element is in the form of a 
connecting pin (7) and the spigot (6), which is of constant outside 

diameter, has on that end of it which is opposite to the region of 
connection to the sleeve (5) an internal screw thread (25) which co-operates 

with an external thread (26) on one end of the connecting pin (7), 
the maximum diameter (7a) of the connecting pin (7) being smaller than 

the inside diameter of the extension element (8) and the extension 
element (8) being mounted on the connecting pin (7) coaxially with it and 

connected detachably to it. 
Furniture according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
for connecting the connecting pin (7,7') to the extension element (8,8') 

there is provided a grub screw (21) passing radially through the wall of 
the extension element (8,8'). 
Furniture according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the 
connecting pin (7,7') has an angular groove (20) which co-operates with 

the grub screw (21) which is screwed into the extension element (8,8').  
 
Furniture according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the 
connecting pin (7,7') has at least one radial bore (20') which co-operates 

with the grub screw (21) which is screwed into the extension 
element (8,8'). 
Furniture according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 
sleeve (5) can be slid onto a preferably cylindrical supporting core (3,3'). 
Furniture according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 
one or more spacer sleeves (4) which are slidable onto the supporting 

core (3) is or are provided for axially locating the plug-on element (2,2') 
on the supporting core (3,3').
