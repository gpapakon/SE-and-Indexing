<ABSTRACT>
The offset of a zero-crossing detector circuit is 
virtually eliminated by inverting the inputs of the 

comparator after a certain delay from a detected zero-crossing 
while storing the output state assumed 

pursuant the detection of a zero-crossing for an 
interval of time longer than said delay but shorter 

than the minimum interval of time occurring between any 
two successive zero-crossings of the input signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
Zero-crossing detectors are generally composed of a
single comparator or of a plurality of cascaded comparators,
the output of which changes state every time
the input signal crosses the zero level. These circuits
are widely employed in digital and in analog-digital
systems. The merit parameters of these circuits are
typically: speed, gain and the equivalent input offset.Commonly, in communication systems that employ a
peak detection technique, the first derivative of an
input signal is fed to a zero-crossing detector. In
this way, a digital signal that is exactly synchronized
with the zero-crossings of the signal representing the
first derivative of the input signal and therefore with
the positive and negative peaks of the input signal,
may be obtained.In this as in other applications, an eventual offset
of the zero-crossing detector circuit produces an error
of synchronization, that is commonly referred to as
"Pulse Pairing". This phenomenon is graphically
depicted in Fig. 1. As it may be observed from Fig. 1,
for a sinusoidal input signal of frequency f and
amplitude Vp, an equivalent input offset ΔV produces a
"Pulse Pairing" whose value τ is given by the following
expression:
τ = [1/(πf)]*sin-1(ΔV/Vp)It is evident that error, in terms of "duty cycle" of
the output signal, is introduced by the Pulse
Pairing phenomenon. In the depicted example, the "duty
cycle" of the output signal contains an error that is
equivalent to 2τ.As mentioned above, a zero-crossing detector circuit
may be constituted by a single comparator, for example 
as the one depicted in Fig. 3. More often though, because
of amplification requirements, the circuit is composed
of a plurality of comparators connected in
cascade. For example the circuit may be constituted by
two comparators G1 and G2 in cascade, as schematically
shown in Fig. 2. Of course, the two comparator stages
G1 and G2 may have an identical circuit, as the one
shown in Fig. 3.For a comparator circuit as shown in Fig. 3, the
standard deviation of the equivalent input offset is
given by:
σoffset= {Vtr1,22+Vtr3,42+[(ΔR/3R)*Vt]2}1/2
where:
Vtrj,k is the standard deviation of the offset
relative to the differential pairs T1-T2 and T3-T4; ΔR/3R is the standard deviation of the percentage
error relative to the load resistances R; Vt is the so-called thermal voltage that is equal to
about 26mV at room temperature.By assuming identical stages G1 and G2 of
the circuit of Fig. 2, they will have the same small
signal gain Gj given by:
Gj=gmR=IR/(2Vt)
the equivalent input
