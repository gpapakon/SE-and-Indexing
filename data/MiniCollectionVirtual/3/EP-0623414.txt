Spot welding electrode holder with at least two electrode (3), of which at
least one first one is provided on a arm element (1, 2, 5) and, with this arm element,

is movable relative to a second electrode (3), with at least one electric power lead
(7, 8) which is manufactured of copper or a copper alloy and which, at a

connection point (14), is electrically connected with the arm element made of
electroconductive material, namely via a resistive connection between at least one

first contact area formed on the arm element (1, 2, 5) and a second contact area
(26) which lies adjacent to the first contact area and is formed on the power lead (7,

8), with the arm element (1, 2, 5) - at least in a partial area including the connection
point (14) - being of aluminium or an aluminium alloy, with the first contact area

(22) being formed of at least two layers or coatings (23 - 25), of which a first layer
(23) of nickel or a nickel alloy is applied to the surface of the arm element, and of

which at least a second layer (25), which forms the outer surface of the first contact
area (22), is of silver or an alloy substantially consisting of silver, and with the

power lead (7, 8) forming a contact block (9) on the connection point (14), this block
having the second contact area on one surface,

   characterised in that

   the second contact area (26) comprises two layers (27, 28), of which a
first layer (27), applied directly to the surface of the power lead (7, 8), is of gold or

an alloy substantially consisting of gold, and a second layer (28) applied over this
comprises silver or an alloy substantially consisting of silver.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with claim 1, characterised
by means (15, 16) for cooling the arm element (1, 2, 5) at the connection point (14). 
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with claim 3 [sic],

characterised in that the means for cooling are formed by at least one channel (15,
16) through which a coolant can flow, and that the channel or at least one coolant

connection (17, 18) are also provided in the connection point (14) or on the contact
areas (22, 26) in order to cool them.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the at least one first contact area (22) is formed of at

least three layers or coatings (23 - 25), of which the first is the layer (23) of nickel
or of the nickel alloy, and of which a second layer (24) applied on the first layer is of

gold or an alloy substantially consisting of gold, and a third layer (25), forming the
outer surface of the first contact area (22), is of silver or of an alloy substantially

consisting of silver.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the aluminium alloy of the at least one arm element is

an aluminium / copper / magnesium alloy, preferably AlCuMg 1F39.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the power supply lead, at least in the connection area,

is formed of a copper / chromium / zirconium alloy (CuCrZr).
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that for the at least one arm element (1, 2, 5), at least two

power supply leads (7, 8) are provided, which rest with their second contact areas
(26) adjacent to opposite sides of the arm element (1, 2, 5), pressed against the

first contact areas (22) there.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the contact block (9) for the power supply (7, 8) forms

at least one coolant connection (17, 18). 
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the contact block (9) is at least partially

accommodated by a recess (21) formed on the arm element (1, 2, 5).
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the layers of the first and/or second contact area are

produced by means of the tampon-galvanisation method.
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the arm element is an arm (1, 2) and/or an arm holder

(5).
Spot welding electrode holder in accordance with one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the at least one power supply lead is formed of an

element (29) comprising copper or a copper alloy, for example of an electrode, an
electrode shaft, electrode holder, and that the second contact area (26) is provided

on this element, and the first contact area (22) is provided on the arm or arm
element (1) of aluminium or aluminium alloy.
