<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to articles comprising
sheets folded with concertina folds and is a divisional
application of European Patent Application number EP
92918258.2.According to the present invention in a first aspect,
there is provided a process for producing articles, each
comprising a sheet of material folded with concertina
folds, characterised in that the process comprises
providing at least one stiff portion thereto comprising
material that is at least partly transparent.Suitably, the process comprises folding the sheet with a
first set of concertina folds and transverse to these a
second set of concertina folds and attaching to each of
two opposite outer segments of the folded sheet stiff
portions comprising material that is at least partly
transparent.According to the present invention in a second aspect,
there is provided an article comprising a sheet folded
with concertina folds and at least one stiff portion
provided to the sheet, characterised in that the stiff
portion comprises transparent material.Suitably, the article comprises a sheet folded with a
first set of concertina folds and transverse to these a
second set of concertina folds, characterised in that the 
article has stiffening of two opposite outer segments of
the folded sheet by means of addition thereto of non-stiff
matter.Suitably, the stiffening comprises lamination.Suitably, the stiffening comprises a hardened coating.Suitably, the stiffening comprises a hardened
impregnation.Reference will now be made by way of example to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a schematic side elevation of a first example
of apparatus for producing a concertina folded sheet with
a stiff portion;Figure 2 is a perspective view of a detail of Figure 1;Figure 3 is a perspective view of another detail of Figure
1;Figure 4 is a view corresponding to Figure 1 of a second
example of apparatus for producing a concertina folded
sheet with a stiff portion.Figure 5 is a perspective view of a detail of Figure 4;Figure 6 is a side elevation of a flight of Figure 4; Figure 7 is a schematic side elevation of details of
Figure 4 just after station 58;Figure 8 is a view corresponding to Figure 7 showing
operation of the process at station 58;Figure 9 is a view corresponding to Figure 8 to illustrate
the process at station 64;Figure 10 shows the action at pinch rollers 66;Figure 11 is a perspective view of a detail of Figure 4
showing how a spray head nozzle co-operates with guide
means 20;Figure 12 is a view corresponding to Figure 8
