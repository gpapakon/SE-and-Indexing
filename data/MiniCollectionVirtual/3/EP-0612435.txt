<ABSTRACT>
A cable harness laying device has at least one holding finger (9) that can be fastened to the laying board (1) and that laterally demarcates the position of the cable harness. The holding finger (9) can be deflected against the force of a spring, preferably in its longitudinal direction, on a plane approximately parallel to the cable harness direction, and afterwards the spring brings it back to its use position. The holding finger (9) is arranged on a rigid support (8) that carries an equally fixed cable harness support (10). When the cable harness is tied, the holding fingers may be pushed aside by the tying tool without causing the cable harness to lose its support and demarcation. The supports (8) of several holding fingers (9) may be interconnected by means of a cable harness support (10) in order to form a holding finger group.

<CLAIMS>
A wiring harness laying device with at least one 
holder (4) which can be mounted on an installation board (1) 

and the retaining fingers (9) of which, laterally defining 
the position of the wiring harness, can be deflected 

transversely to the longitudinal direction of the wiring 
harness, characterised in that the holder (4) is formed from 

at least two supports (8), which are secured to the 
installation board (1) and which are connected with one 

another by a bridge (10), and from two retaining fingers (9) 
each arranged on a support (8) and projecting above the 

bridge (10), wherein the bridge (10) is arranged securely as 
a cable harness support and the retaining fingers (9) are 

displaceable in their longitudinal direction on or in the 
support (8) and can be returned into the operative position 

by spring force. 
A wiring harness laying device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the retaining fingers (9) can be 

inserted telescopically into the associated tubular support 
(8).
