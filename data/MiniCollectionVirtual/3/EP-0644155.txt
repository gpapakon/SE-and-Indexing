<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuous process for the preparation of aluminium nitride by carbonitridation of alumina. According to this process, the reaction, which involves alumina, carbon and nitrogen, is carried out in a moving bed reactor, characterised in that the reaction region has a plurality of pipes.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the continuous preparation of aluminium 
nitride by a carbonitriding reaction starting from 

alumina, carbon and nitrogen, characterized in that the 
reaction is carried out in a moving-bed reactor whose 

reaction area is composed of a plurality of conduits, the 
space between the said conduits consisting of a solid 

heat-conducting material. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the conduits, which may be identical or different, 

have a cross-section of regular shape. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the regular shape is chosen from circles, ellipses, 

annuli, right or curvilinear polygons, either regular or 
non-regular, and geometrical shapes having an axis of 

symmetry. 
Process according to either of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the shape is circular. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the conduits are arranged uniformly 

inside the reaction area. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the conduits are arranged such that their centre is 

located on one or more concentric circles whose origin is 
the centre of the reactor. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the conduits are nested within each other. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that alumina and carbon, combined with 

a binder, are employed in the form of granules having a 
crushing strength of between 0.2 and 3 MPa and an  

 
attrition loss of less than 15 %.
