<ABSTRACT>
To assign a car to a hall call such that cars A, 
B, C, D tend to be equally spaced apart and so that bunching 

of cars is avoided, the position of each car is predicted 
over a given period by estimating where it will arrive and 

leave each of its committed stops over that period for a 
given set of hall call/car call assignments, a bunching 

measure is calculated and a car to hall call assignment 
is made in response to the bunching measure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bunching of 
elevators. As elevators operate in a group serving a common 
set of floors, the cars frequently will be close 
together with respect to position and direction. For 
instance, in a four-car group, it is not uncommon to 
observe three elevators traveling up in the lower 
portion of the building. This phenomenon is called 
"bunching." Bunching is defined loosely to mean that 
certain cars are "close together". The absence of 
bunching means that the cars are evenly distributed 
amongst the floors. Bunching is not always undesirable, 
as when several cars converge to a convention floor to 
move a large number of people. As a rule, however, 
bunching is undesirable. In general, a system in which 
the cars are evenly distributed amongst the floors will 
result in a minimum average waiting time for the 
randomly arriving passenger. The phenomenon of bunching is illustrated in 
Figure 1 which shows both Cars A and B traveling down in 
the top part of a 15-story building. Also, Cars C and D 
are reasonably close to one another. A wait-so-far 
time, when the hall call was registered to the present 
time, is shown for each hall call. The waiting time is 
the time from when a passenger presses a hall call 
button until the elevator arrives. Intuitively, a 
longer than desired waiting time might occur if a  
 
passenger would register a down hall call at Floor 15. 
The maximum waiting times could be reduced if the cars 
were more evenly distributed: Car A might be Positioned 
at Floor 7-DOWN, and Car C might be positioned at floor 
8-UP. With reference to Figure 1, it can be seen that 
this repositioning of the cars is impossible because of 
the hall call and car call assignments. The 
impossibility of the proposed repositioning of the cars 
underscores the difficult nature of solving the bunching 
problem. Document D1 (US-A-4982817) discloses a method for 
assigning a hall call to an elevator car, comprising: 
providing predicted distances between proximate cars; 
calculating a bunching measure from said predicted 
distances; assigning said hall call to said elevator car 
in response to said bunching measure. Objectives in the present invention include 
assigning an elevator car to a hall call such that 
elevators in an elevator group tend to be equally spaced 
apart as they service hall calls and car calls and 
therefore bunching is avoided. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of assigning a specific hall call to a 
selected one of a

<CLAIMS>
A method of assigning a specific hall call to a 
selected one of a plurality of elevator cars operating 

as a group in a building, comprising: 

for each one of said cars in said group: 

tentatively assigning said specific hall call to one of 
said cars; determining the distance between predicted 

positions of proximate cars; calculating a bunching 
measure as a function of said determined distances; and 
assigning said specific hall call to a selected one 
of said cars in a process utilizing said bunching 

measure, characterized by, for each one of said cars in 
said group, predicting the position in said building at 

which each of said cars will be after each of a number 
of future time intervals, if said specific hall call is 

assigned to said one car. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said bunching measure 
is calculated in response to the squares of the 

distances between proximate cars. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said bunching 
measure is calculated in response to the sum of the 

square of the distances between proximate cars. 
The method of claim 3, further comprising: 

providing an objective function in response to a 
remaining response time and a predicted registration 

time and said bunching measure; wherein 
said specific hall call is assigned to said one 
elevator car in response to said objective function. 
The method of claim 4 wherein said objective 
function is provided in response to said remaining 

response time, said predicted registration time, said  
 

bunching measure, and a maximum predicted registration 
time. 
The method of claim 4 wherein said objection 
function is provided in response to said remaining 

response time, said predicted registration time, said 
maximum predicted registration time, said bunching 

measure and an RSR quantity.
