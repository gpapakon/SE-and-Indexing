<ABSTRACT>
A transformer is used to charge the battery of an 
electric automobile. The primary (18) of the transformer is 

connected to a fixed power supply and is separable from a 
secondary (30, 32) mounted in the automobile. The secondary 

(30, 32) is cooled by cooling structure (36, 38) mounted on 
the secondary (30, 32), particularly a heat pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automobile charging transformer 
comprising a primary inductive charge coupler for attachment 
to a fixed power supply, said primary inductive charge coupler 
having a primary electric winding, an inductive charge receptacle 
including a transformer secondary electric winding for mounting 
in the automobile to charge the battery of the electric 
automobile, a magnetic core for completing a magnetic circuit 
through said primary and secondary windings, and means connected 
to said secondary winding to cool said secondary transformer 
winding. The invention relates further to an electric automobile 
having an electric propulsion motor and an electric battery 
connected to energize said propulsion motor and charging means 
for said battery so that said battery can be charged from a 
fixed power source, wherein said automobile comprises the above 
charging transformer. Such an automobile charging transformer and such an electric 
automobile are known from EP-A-0 650 240 which is comprised 
in the state of art according to Art. 54 (3) EPC.  
 The electric automobile battery is charged from 
an external source through a magnetic coupling comprising 
a transformer. The transformer secondary inductive 
charge receptacle is on the automobile. Cooling of the 
secondary receptacle is achieved by a heat pipe lying 
adjacent to the secondary and radiating away from the 
secondary. In order to reduce air pollution, there is a 
modern trend toward electrically powered automobiles. 
These electrically powered automobiles have rechargeable 
batteries therein. The power of the batteries is used 
to propel the automobile and to provide for other power 
needs thereof. The design of such a vehicle is a 
careful balance between payload, performance, range 
between charging, acceleration, and speed. No matter 
what the combination of these criteria, there is need to 
recharge the batteries periodically so that the automobile 
may be taken on another excursion. With fairly 
large battery capacity, there is need to recharge at a 
substantial amount of power. Since the time when an 
automobile is unavailable should be minimized, high 
charging rates are desirable. If an ordinary plug is to 
be used, the plug must be suited for high power, which 
brings about a risk of harm to the operator and/or other  
 
people in the vicinity from contact with parts of the 
electrical supply system. It is, thus, desirable to make a coupling 
between the charging station and the automobile which 
does not require the
