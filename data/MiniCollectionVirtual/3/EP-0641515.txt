<ABSTRACT>
A method of combating undesired plant growth at a 
locus is disclosed, the method comprising applying to the 

locus a compound of general formula: 

where 
R¹ and R² independently represent a hydrogen atom or 

an optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl group or R¹ and 
R² together represent an optionally substituted alkyl or 

alkenyl chain;
 

R³ represents an optionally substituted saturated or 
unsaturated homocyclic or heterocyclic group;

 
and Z represents a group -COOR⁴ where R⁴ represents a 

hydrogen atom, a cation or an optionally substituted 
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl group, or Z represents a 

group -CHO. 
The use of a compound of general formula I as a 
herbicide and a herbicidal comp
osition are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of combating 
undesired plant growth and to herbicidal compositions. 
The invention employs substituted epoxy compounds. α,β-Epoxydiazomethyl ketone compounds and methods of 
preparation thereof are disclosed in Tetrahedron, 36, 
2141, (1980). No use of the compounds is disclosed. U.K. Patent Application GB 2 120 235 (Imperial 
Chemical Industries plc) discloses triazole and imidazole 
derivations having fungicidal and plant growth regulating 
activity. A broad class of substituted epoxy compounds is 
disclosed as intermediates in the preparation of the 
triazole and imidazole derivatives. No other use of the 
substituted epoxy intermediates is disclosed. This invention is based upon the discovery of a class 
of substituted epoxy compounds that have been found to 
exhibit herbicidal activity. In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of combating 
undesired plant growth at a locus, comprising applying to 
the locus a compound of general formula: 
   where 
R¹ and R² independently represent a hydrogen 
atom or an optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl group 
or R¹ and R² together represent an optionally substituted 
alkyl or alkenyl chain;
 
 
   R³ represents an optionally substituted saturated or 
unsaturated homocyclic or heterocyclic group;
 
   and Z represents a group -COOR⁴ where R⁴ represents a 
hydrogen atom, a cation or an optionally substituted 
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl group, or Z represents a 
group -CHO. Compounds of general formula I may exist in a number 
of stereo-isomeric forms and all such forms fall within 
the scope of the present invention. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties 
comprises an alkyl group, the alkyl group may be linear or 
branched and may suitably contain 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 
6, and most preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, suitable 
examples being methyl, ethyl and propyl. When any groups 
are designated as being optionally substituted, the 
substituent groups which are optionally present may be any 
of those customarily employed in the development of 
pesticidal compounds, and/or the modification of such 
compounds to influence their structure/activity, 
persistence, penetration or other property. In relation 
to moieties defined above which comprise an optionally 
substituted alkyl- or alkenyl group, specific examples of 
such substituents include halogen, especially fluorine, 
chlorine or bromine atoms, and nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, C₁₋₄ 
alkoxy, C₁₋₄ haloalkoxy,
