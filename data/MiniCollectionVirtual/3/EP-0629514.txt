<ABSTRACT>
The transfer layer (28) of a coating blanket (10) 
has a low affinity for liquid coating material or ink, 

rather than a high affinity which characterizes conventional 
nitrile rubber and photopolymer blankets. The low 

affinity material, for example a fluorinated polymer or a 
silicone elastomer, resists wetting by the liquid media, 

and has a tendency to form a non-spreading bead or droplet 
of the liquid coating material on the transfer media 

surface. The low affinity surface provides smooth and 
quick release of the substrate from the nip between the 

coating blanket cylinder (12) and the impression cylinder 
(20). The low affinity transfer surface further inhibits 

the accumulation of ink and/or liquid coating material, 
thereby preventing split images, ghost images, offset 

images and back-trapping defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sheet-fed or 
web-fed, rotary offset or flexographic printing presses, 
and more particularly to an improved coating blanket for 
the application of protective and/or decorative coatings to 
the printed surface of freshly printed sheets or web stock. In rotary offset printing, an image which is to 
be reproduced on a sheet of paper or some other print stock 
is formed on a printing plate which is attached to the 
surface of a rotatable plate cylinder. The image is not 
printed directly from the plate onto the paper, but is 
first transferred to an intermediate ink transfer blanket, 
which is mounted on a rotatable blanket cylinder. The 
blanket transfers (offsets) the inked image to a sheet of 
paper which is fed through the nip between a rotatable 
impression cylinder and the blanket cylinder. The offset 
printing press thus includes a plate cylinder which carries 
the printing image, a blanket cylinder which has an ink 
transfer surface for receiving the inked image, and an 
impression cylinder which presses the paper against the 
blanket so that the inked image is transferred to the 
paper. In some printing applications, it is desirable 
that the press be capable of applying a protective and/or 
decorative coating over all or a portion of the surface of  
 
the printed sheets. Conventional coating liquids include 
varnish, lacquer, dye and adhesives. Some coatings are 
formed of a UV-curable or water-soluble resin applied as a 
liquid solution or emulsion via an applicator roller and 
coating blanket over the freshly printed sheets to protect 
the ink from set-off or offset and improve the appearance 
of the sheets. The use of such coatings is particularly 
desirable when glossy, decorative or protective finishes 
are required such as in the production of posters, record 
jackets, brochures, magazines, folding cartons, labels and 
the like. In press jobs where a liquid coating is to be 
applied, the coating operation is performed after the final 
ink printing has been completed, preferably by an in-line 
coater. Conventional coating apparatus which is operable 
as an in-line press operation utilizes an engraved applicator 
roller, with the liquid coating being supplied to the 
engraved roller by means of a doctor blade assembly. 
Liquid coating material picked up by the engraved applicator 
roller is transferred to a coating blanket cylinder for 
subsequent application to a printed sheet. Conventional blankets have a pliable surface made 
of a material such as
