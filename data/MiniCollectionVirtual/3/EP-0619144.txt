<CLAIMS>
A hose arrangement with one or more elements, of at least one polymer material, for
a centrifuge free of sliding seals, the said hose arrangement featuring at least two

layers of at least one polymer material with differing Shore hardness values,
characterised in that the Shore hardness values rise from the inside to the outside,

in co-extruded form, in which situation the inside area (32) features a Shore
hardness A from 50-100, and the outer area (34) a Shore hardness D of 50-90.
A hose arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the outer area
features a Shore hardness D of 60-70 and the inner area a Shore hardness A of about

90.
A hose arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the outer area (34)
consists of polyamide or copolymers with polyethylene, and the inner area (32)

consists of polyvinyl chloride or polyurethane.
