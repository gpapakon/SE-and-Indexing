<ABSTRACT>
In order to satisfy both of a requirement for 
improvement in safety for a child provided by a pair of 

head guards (4, 5) and a requirement for relief from 
crampedness in a child seat apparatus such as a child 

safety seat (1) for an automobile comprising the head 
guards (4, 5) frontwardly extending from both side edges 

of a backrest portion (3), the head guards (4, 5) are 
mounted on the backrest portion (3) to be rotatable about 

axes extending substantially in parallel with the 
direction of upward extension of the backrest portion (3). 

It is possible to reduce the space between the pair of 
head guards (4, 5) for attaining a safe state when the 

child is asleep, while the space between the head guards 
(4, 5) can be increased when the child is awake, to 

prevent it from feeling cramped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seat 
apparatus and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a child 
seat apparatus. An exemplary known child seat apparatus is a child safety 
seat for an automobile, which is mounted on an original 
seat of an automobile for providing a seat for safely 
seating a child in the automobile. Such a child safety seat for an automobile comprises 
a seat portion, and a backrest portion upwardly extending 
from a rear end of the seat portion. The child safety 
seat may further comprise head guards, in order to protect 
the head portion of the child on both sides. Such head 
guards are generally provided to frontwardly extend from 
both side edges of the backrest portion. Since the head guards are provided in consideration 
of safety for the child, the space between the pair of 
head guards is preferably reduced to be capable of 
locating the head portion of the child. Particularly when  
 
the child is asleep, the space between the head guards is 
preferably reduced in consideration of safety. If the space between the head guards is too small, 
however, the child disadvantageously feels cramped. When 
the child is awake, for example, it generally enjoys the 
scene from the car window. In this case, the head guards 
unpreferably narrow the view of the child if the same are 
in proximity to the head portion of the child. In consideration of such a background, the space 
between the head guards is generally designed to satisfy 
the aforementioned inconsistent requirements. However, it 
is difficult to sufficiently satisfy both of these 
requirements. Apparatuses providing child seats include not only 
the aforementioned child safety seat for an automobile, 
but a baby carriage, a child chair and the like. Such 
child seat apparatuses have the aforementioned problem in 
common.  
 EP-A-0589071, considered during substantive 
examination of this application and published after 
the first of the two priority dates claimed, 
discloses a child seat apparatus comprising: a seat 
portion; a backrest portion upwardly extending from a 
rear end of the seat portion; and a pair of side wing 
members extending frontwardly from the backrest 
portion and upwardly from the seat portion. The side 
wing members include portions which may act as head 
guards and the space between the side wing members is 
changeable. EP-A-0232237, also considered during substantive 
examination of this application, discloses a child 
seat apparatus comprising: a seat portion; a backrest 
portion upwardly
