<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving the 
foaming property of a nonionic surfactant and a foaming 
composition comprising a nonionic surfactant. More 
particularly, it relates to a method for improving the 
foaming property of a specific nonionic surfactant having 
particularly low irritating properties and a low-irritating 
foaming composition comprising the specific nonionic 
surfactant and containing substantially no anionic surfactant 
which causes stimulation adversely affecting the skin or 
mucosa (i.e., irritation). Toiletry products, such as facial cleansers, 
shampoos, toothpaste, and some types of bath additives, 
conventionally contain anionic surfactants having an 
excellent foaming property as a foaming component. However, 
because anionic surfactants irritate the skin, less 
irritating foaming components have been demanded. On the other hand, nonionic surfactants are generally 
less irritating and highly safe and therefore widely used in 
skin or hair care products such as detergents, products which 
come into contact with the sensitive parts including the 
mucosa, such as dish washing detergents, bath additives and 
medicines, and cosmetics which are desired to remain on the  
 
skin for an extended period of time, such as creams, 
emulsions and lotions. Additionally, they are preferred in 
detergents for infants and those who have a sensitive skin. However, nonionic surfactants are less foamable, 
which is disadvantageous for use in detergents. Although 
foaming does not always agree with the basic performance, 
such as detergency, users are accustomed to foaming 
detergents and dislike foamless ones. Therefore, nonionic 
surfactants are rarely used alone in detergents and often 
combined with amine oxide type surfactants or anionic 
surfactants for obtaining better foaming. Nevertheless, the 
compounding ratio of these surfactants must be minimized 
because of their high irritation to the skin, resulting in a 
failure of providing sufficient foam while retaining low 
irritation. In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, 
several methods for imparting the foaming property to 
nonionic surfactants have been proposed to date. Examples of such techniques include a composition 
containing an alkyl glucoside nonionic surfactant which, 
while irritating, foams by itself with a specific 
manipulation of formulation (as disclosed in JP-A-2-32197, 
the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published 
Japanese patent application"), a composition containing a 
sucrose
