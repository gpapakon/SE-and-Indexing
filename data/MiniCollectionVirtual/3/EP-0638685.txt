<ABSTRACT>
Described are mercerisation wetting agents comprising a compound of the formula 
<
IMAGE
>
  where     R1 is hydroxyl or -SO3M,   R2 is C4-C18-alkyl,   M is an alkali metal,   n is 0 or 1, and   m is from 2 to 6.   The mercerisation wetting agents of the invention are notable for good wetting and low foaming. The compounds are also readily biodegradable.
