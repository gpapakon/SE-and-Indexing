<ABSTRACT>
A wheel chair comprised of a frame 1 provided with a seat 
section 4 in which a user is seated, and wheels consisting 

of a pair of front wheels 10 and a pair of rear wheels 
11, both rotatably attached to said frame 1, the wheels 

having rims 14 and tires 15 supported by the rims 14, the 
tires 15 being annular hollow objects made of an elastomer 

material that permit the tread of the tires to be deformed 
elasticity into a flat shape to ensure the movement of the 

wheel chair on soft or irregular surfaces, and the rims 14 
being provided with flange sections 20 that permit the 

elasticity deformed sections of the tires 15 to be 
supported from the inside surfaces thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a wheel chair used in daily 
life. A known wheel chair is equipped with tires that, like 
those used for a bicycle, have a smaller tread and a large 
amount of tread pressure. When, therefore, the known wheel chair travels on soft or 
irregular surfaces on turf, grass fields, sand beaches, 
dry riverbeds, graveled or snow-covered roads, trouble may 
occur such as damage to the turf, mechanical shocks to the 
user of the wheel chair caused by these irregular 
surfaces, tires being trapped in such irregular surfaces; 
the above trouble disables the movement of the wheel chair 
or forces the user thereof to stop moving it, thus greatly 
narrowing the scope of activities of the user.  Taking the above into consideration, it is an object of 
the present invention to provide a wheel chair capable of 
freely moving on soft or irregular surfaces on turf, sand 
beaches, or the like, hence expanding the scope of 
activities of the user. It is a further object of the 
invention to provide a wheel chair in which operability 
and safety are improved as to braking and backward 
tipping. In order to achieve said objective, as is specified in 
Claim 1, the wheel chair of the present invention 
comprises a frame provided with a seat section in which a 
user is seated, and wheels consisting of a pair of front 
wheels and a pair of rear wheels, both rotatably attached 
to said frame, said wheels having rims and tires supported 
by said rims, said tires being annular hollow objects made 
of an elastomer material that permits the tread of said 
tires to be deformed elasticity into a flat shape to 
ensure the motion of the wheel chair on soft or irregular 
surfaces, said rims being provided with flange sections 
that permit the elasticity deformed sections of said tires 
to be supported by the inner surfaces of the rims.  The wheel chair of said claim 1, as is specified in Claim 
2, is of a type which is operable with a helper's 
assistance, a type which is operable both by only the user 
and with a helper's assistance, and a type which is 
operable with an electric motor. Also, the wheel chair of 
Claim 1 wherein, as is specified in Claim 3, said frame is 
foldable or can be knocked down when the front and rear 
wheels are removed from the frame. As is specified in Claim 4, the wheel chair of Claim 1 is 
equipped with a parking brake above the rear wheels, said 
parking brake member being provided so that it can freely 
move nearly horizontally and vertically, and said brake 
member, upon being

A wheel chair, comprised of a frame provided with a 
seat section in which a user is seated, and wheels 

consisting of a pair of front wheels and a pair of 
rear wheels, both rotatably attached to said frame, 

said wheels having rims and tires supported by said 
rims, said tires being annular hollow objects made of 

an elastomer material that permits the tread of said 
tires to be deformed elasticallyinto a flat shape to 

ensure the movement of the wheel chair on soft or 
irregular surfaces, and said rims being provided with 

flange sections that permit the elastically deformed 
sections of said tires to be supported from the inside 

surfaces thereof. 
The wheel chair of Claim 1 wherein said wheel chair is 
characterized by a type which is operable with a 

helper's assistance only, a type which is both user 
operable and with a helper's assistance, and a type 

which is operable with an electric motor. 
The wheel chair of Claim 1 wherein said frame of said 
wheel chair is foldable or can be knocked down when 

the rear wheels are removed from the frame or the 
front and rear wheels are removed from the frame. 
The wheel chair of Claim 1 wherein a parking brake 
member is disposed above rear wheels, said parking 

brake being set so that it can freely move nearly 
horizontally and vertically, and said brake, upon 

being lowered , being pressed on the upper parts of 
the pair of rear wheels on both sides to brake the 

revolution of the pair of rear wheels. 
A wheel chair of Claim 1 wherein a backward tipping 
prevention section is provided at the back of the 

seat, the lower end of said backward tipping 
prevention member being disposed so that it can freely 

swing back and forth as a free end, said lower end 
member being directed toward the direction of gravity.
