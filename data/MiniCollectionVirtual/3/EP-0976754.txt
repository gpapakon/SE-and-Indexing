<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a therapeutic and
preventive medicament for respiratory diseases, comprising,

as an active ingredient, a compound represented by the
general formula (1):



wherein R
1
 represents a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and R
2
 represents a
hydrogen or halogen atom, a substituted alkyl group, an

amino group which may be substituted, a carboxyl group, an
alkoxycarbonyl group, a carbamoyl group, or an

alkylcarbamoyl group, or a salt thereof. This compound has
excellent tracheobronchodilative effect and inhibitory

effect on airway constriction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a therapeutic and
preventive medicament for respiratory diseases represented
by asthma in particular, and to novel pyrrolopyrazolopyrimidine
derivatives.At present, bronchodilation by xanthine type
bronchodilators typified by theophylline are mainly
practiced for the prevention and treatment of respiratory
diseases represented by asthma and the like. Besides,
beta-receptor stimuli such as ephedrine hydrochloride have
been only used symptomatolytically.However, all the above drugs have great side effects
and hence have offered a problem. However, there has been
nothing for it but to administer these drugs because any
excellent drug substitutable for these drugs has not been
yet found.On the other hand, 3-cyano-5-methylpyrrolo[3,2-e]-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines
as compounds having a pyrrolo[3,2-e]pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine
skeleton have been known
to have excellent vasodilative effect and tracheobronchodilative
effect (Japanese Patent Publication No. 
88999/1994). However, these compounds have been difficult
to separate their action on circulatory organs such as
hypotensive effect and their action on tracheas (or
bronchus) from each other. It has therefore been desired
to develop a drug which selectively acts on tracheas (or
bronchus).EP-A-0 369 145 discloses pyrrolo[3,2-E]pyrazolo[1,5-A]
pyrimidine derivatives of the general formula (I)

wherein R1 and R2 independently represent H, or an optionally
substituted (cyclo)alkyl, phenyl or heterocyclic group, and R3
is H or CN. The compounds are disclosed as being effective in
the treatment of circulatory diseases as well as having
bronchodilation activity. It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a medicine which scarcely exhibits side effects
and has excellent prophylactic and therapeutic effects on
respiratory diseases.In view of the foregoing circumstances, the present
inventors have carried out an extensive investigation by
syntheses, screening and the like with a view toward
seeking compounds useful in the prevention and treatment
of respiratory diseases. As a result, it has been found
that compounds represented by the general formula (1),
which will be described subsequently, or salts thereof
have excellent tracheobronchodilative effect and
inhibitory effect on airway constriction, act only weakly
on circulatory organs, and are hence useful as
prophylactic and therapeutic medicines for respiratory
diseases, thus leading to completion of the present
invention.According to the present invention, there is
