<ABSTRACT>
A person who belongs to a radio system with a short range, 
for example a wireless telephony system, can be temporarily 

transferred as guest into a second wireless 
telephony system. When the user moves to a second communications 

system, he identifies himself in it as a 
guest. Information relating to the temporary address of 

the relevant person is transferred to his home system. An 
incoming call to the person in question is received by 

the home system which forwards the call to the system in 
which the person sought is temporarily registered. The 

caller is then notified that a call is coming in by a 
call signal being originated. The called party then 

answers the call and a normal call is set up. 
With the outgoing call, signals are transferred 
from the caller to means in the network which register 

who is establishing the call. The registration is carried 
out on the basis of a call occurring from a certain 

subscription, or person, regardless of whether the call 
is established from the home system or as guest in 

another system. The system then registers the length of 
the call and debits the subscriber at his home address.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement 
for producing, in a mobile radio communications system 
comprising, on the one hand, closely placed base stations 
and operating at short range and, on the one hand, mobile 
units, a simplified function for mobile units from a 
first communications system to communicate via a second 
communications system. In radio systems, preferably cordless telecommunication 
standards, extensive mobility, including the 
possibility of incoming and outgoing calls, for telephones 
can only be offered by mobile telephone systems of 
the NMT and GSM types. These require an extensive, costly 
infrastructure overlaid on the existing fixed telephone 
network. None of the mobile telephone systems existing 
today are constructed for handling the high traffic 
intensity and service quality required by customers in 
the fixed telephone network. Nor is there any system 
today which can handle the "anarchistic" infrastructure 
with an uncontrollable variety of private and public 
access systems which are an unavoidable consequence of 
the trend towards a completely liberalized telecommunications 
market which can be seen today. In wireless communications 
systems, it has previously been known, 
according to Patent Specification WO 92/10913, to 
increase the user friendliness in cordless mobile telephone 
systems. Extensive mobility including the capability of 
incoming and outgoing calls for telephones can only be  
 
offered today by mobile telephone systems of the NMT and 
GSM types. These require an extensive and costly infrastructure, 
overlaid on the existing fixed telephone 
network. None of the mobile telephone systems existing 
today are constructed for handling the high traffic 
intensity and service quality required by customers in 
the fixed telephone network. Neither can they handle the 
"anarchistic" infrastructure with an uncontrollable 
variety of private and public access systems which are an 
unavoidable consequence of the trend towards a completely 
liberalized telecommunications market which can be seen 
today. A limited mobility for telephones is offered by 
cordless telephones existing today (so-called CT0, CT1, 
CT2 and CT3) and coming telephone standards (DECT). The 
restriction means mobility only within the range of one 
or a small number of base stations (cells or clusters, 
respectively), or capability to initiate calls (and also 
a rudimentary capability for incoming calls in certain 
systems) in public base stations (so-called telepoint).

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for producing in a radio system a 
simplified function for mobile units from a first comm
unications 
system, including closely placed base 

stations and operating at short range, to communicate via 
a second communications system comprising closely placed 

base stations and operating at short range, characterized 
in that the said first and second communications systems 

can be connected to a telphone network operating with a 
personal telephony service, in that a respective mobile 

unit affected is arranged to establish connections with 
the said second communications system and via the second 

communications system to connect itself to the said 
personal telephony service, in that the said personal 

telephony service is arranged to accommodate the subscription 
of the affected mobile units and in that the 

subscription of a respective affected mobile unit can be 
activated on connection of the respective affected mobile 

unit to the said personal telephony service, the simplification 
consisting in the accessibility of the mobile 

unit to the second communications system by means of the 
mobile unit from the first communications system. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a respective affected mobile unit utilizing the 

said first and/or second communications system is 
arranged to have a personal account provided for this 

purpose debited, and in that the said personal account is 
handled by an intelligent network. 
Arrangement according to Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the said first communications system is 

a home base for private customers, and in that the said 
second communications system is a business network with 

a number of base stations or a home base. 
Arrangement according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the said first communications 

system is a business network with a number of base 
stations, and in that the said second communications 

system is a business network with a number of base 
stations or a home base for private customers. 
Arrangement according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said first and/or 

second communications system is a cordless communications 
system, preferably a DECT system, and in that the said 

telephone system is the general telephone network. 
Arrangement according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said personal telephony 

service included in the telephone system is a service for 
personal mobility, preferably UPT (Universal Personal 

Telecommunication). 
Arrangement according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said telephone system 

is a mobile radio system, preferably one of the radio 
systems with the designations GSM and NMT. 
Arrangement according to any of Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that the said telephone system is a 

broadband system, preferably the broadband system with 
the designation ISDN.
