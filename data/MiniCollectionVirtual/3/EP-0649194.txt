<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector having crosstalk reduction 
between selected pairs of electrical contacts comprises a 

printed circuit board having a pair of circuit elements 
therein connected to selected contacts in the connector. 

The signal paths of such selected contacts are re-routed by 
means of the pattern of circuit elements in the printed 

circuit board, each circuit element balancing the mutual 
inductance in such re-routed signal paths for enhanced 

crosstalk reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrical
connectors and, more specifically, to an electrical
connector having reduced crosstalk interference.Efforts have recently been made to utilize
conventional telephone RJ45 jack and plug connectors for
data transmission having higher transmission frequencies
than is required in voice transmission. The performance
criteria for such jack and plug connectors is governed by
the EIA/TIA standard TSB-40 (connecting hardware
specification), Category 5. One aspect of the Category 5
level in the standard is a lower level of crosstalk coupling
between adjacent contacts in the electrical connectors. By
way of example, a standard OMNI RJ45 jack connector in
commercial use by assignee of the subject application meets
Category 3 of the crosstalk requirements per the TSB-40
performance requirements.It is known that crosstalk reduction or cancellation may be achieved in an
electrical connector by adding capacitance between certain pairs of conductors
or contacts within a standard OMNI jack. In particular, U.S. patent Nos.
4,695,115 and 4,772,224 disclose a modular printed circuit board jack
connector that utilizes tombstone and parallelpiped capacitors to increase the
capacitance between contacts and thereby reduce crosstalk. Additionally,
European patent application EP-A-0524358 discloses a connector that utilizes a
plate extending parallel to the contacts to provide capacitive coupling and
reduced crosstalk between adjacent contacts. None of these patent
publications discloses cutting and rerouting the contacts of the connector in
order to reduce crosstalk between the contacts of the connector. It is therefore desirable to not only achieve an
electrical connector having the Category 5 crosstalk
requirements, but also to decrease the cost of such
connectors and improve the manufacturability thereof. It is
further desirable to continue to utilize standard devices as
much as possible, such as the use of a standard OMNI plug if
a modified jack in connection therewith satisfactorily meets
the Category 5 performance level.It is accordingly an object of the subject invention
to provide an electrical connector which achieves reduced
crosstalk coupling between selected pairs of electrical
contacts.In accordance with the present invention,
there is provided an electrical connector comprising;
an insulative housing; anda plurality of electrical contacts supported on said
housing in a mutually spaced side-by-side arrangement,
characterised by at least first and second of said contacts
