<ABSTRACT>
A powdery or granular protein product comprising a protein fraction originating from a water-insoluble protein phase resulting from rendering of animal fat tissue, and a protein fraction, resulting from an aqueous proteinaceous phase produced by rendering of animal fat tissue, whereby the amount of protein resulting from the aqueous proteinaceous phase in a given portion of the protein product is higher than the amount present in the aqueous proteinaceous phase produced by rendering the amount of fat tissue resulting in the water-insoluble proteinaceous phase present in the portion in question of the protein product, said powdery or granular protein product having good water-absorbent and emulsifying properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powdery or granular 
protein product, a process for the preparation thereof 
and foodstuff containing the protein product. Animal fat tissue is a by-product in the cutting up 
of slaughtered animals, such as hogs and cows, and is in 
connection with the present invention preferably hog fat, 
leaf fat or ox fat tissue. The fat tissue is comminuted or chopped into particles 
of a size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, 
preferably to a particle size of from 2-10 mm, and subjected 
to a fat rendering process. The rendering results in a solid 
phase and a liquid consisting of two liquid phases. The two 
liquid phases may be separated in a fatty phase and an 
aqueous phase containing inorganic and organic components, 
in particular water-soluble proteins, including membrane 
proteins. The solid phase, which is neither soluble in fat 
nor water, consists for the major part of structured protein 
from the fat tissue, but also contains fat which has not yet 
entered the separated fat phase. The aqueous proteinaceous phase is termed stick 
water, and the solid, water-insoluble protein phase is 
termed greaves in the present specification with claims, in 
accordance with commonly used terminology. The fat phase, which is the main product from the 
rendering process, is not used in the present invention, and 
may be used for any other purpose. For the rendering of fat tissue both direct and indirect 
heating may be used. At the direct heating it is preferred 
to introduce atmospheric aqueous vapour to the container 
holding the comminuted fat tissue. At the indirect 
heating the container holding the comminuted fat tissue is 
supplied with heat from the outside, and in order to avoid 
heat damage, for instance scorching of the fat tissue, it is 
preferred to boil the fat in water under reduced pressure. The amount of stick water depends on the chosen heating  
 
method, as the boiling water or condensated water vapour 
contributes to the total amount. In a fat rendering process, in which direct heating 
with water vapour is used, the resulting stick water has typically 
a dry solids content of approx. 4% by weight. The 
moist greaves have after a single fat rendering a fat content 
of 8-25% by weight, typically approx. 10%, in a well-functioning 
fat rendering process. These moist greaves may 
be subjected to an additional fat rendering process, where-after 
the fat content in the moist greave will typically be 
approx. 4% by weight. The proteins contained in stick
