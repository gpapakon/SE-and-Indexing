<ABSTRACT>
Processes are provided for the production of a carbamoylase enzyme which has the capability of converting a D-N-carbamoyl (optionally substituted phenyl) glycine into the corresponding D-(optionally substitued phenyl) glycine by expressing recombinant DNA encoding a carbamoylase gene in a homologous host. Also provided are specific recombinant DNA vectors producing high levels of expression of the carbamoylase enzyme and/or a hydantoinase enzyme in homologous and heterologous hosts and their use in the production of D-(alpha) amino acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA molecules and to recombinant vectors for use in
the transformation of a microbial host. In particular, the invention relates to DNA
encoding a carbamoylase enzyme and to hosts transformed with recombinant vectors
comprising the said DNA.Certain D-α-amino acids are well known pharmaceutical intermediates. For
example D(-) p-hydroxyphenylglycine is used as a starting material for the production
of the antibiotic amoxycillin. Processes for the preparation of D-α-amino acids are
therefore of importance and several enzymatic processes enabling production of D-product
from racemic starting material have been reported.U.K. patents 1,534,426 and 1,564,982, for example, disclose hydantoinase
producing organisms which will hydrolyse 5-(substituted phenyl)hydantoins to give
intermediate D-N-carbamoyl-(substituted phenyl)glycines. However, to obtain the
corresponding D-α-amino acid it is necessary subsequently to hydrolyse the
N-carbamoyl compounds formed, for example with nitrous acid.To overcome the problem of having a first enzymatic and a second chemical
step to prepare D-α-amino acids from hydantoin starting material it is possible to
convert the N-carbamoyl intermediate into the α-amino acid enzymatically with a
carbamoylase enzyme produced by a micro-organism, e.g. an Agrobacterium species as
described in U.K. Patent No. 2,022,581. A drawback with Agrobacterium NRRL
B11291 described in U.K. Patent No. 2,022,581, however, is that only limited
amounts of carbamoylase enzyme are produced. In addition, the organism exhibits
other enzyme activity which may be undesirable in certain circumstances.PCT application WO 92/10579 (Kanegafuchi) discloses the production of D α
amino acids using bacteria transformed with recombinant DNA encoding a
carbamoylase enzyme which converts D-N- carbamoyl-α-amino acid to a D-α
amino acid.We have found that surprisingly higher levels of enzyme activity can be
obtained when a carbamoylase gene is expressed in a homologous host. By
'homologous host' we mean that the host is the same type of organism from which the
gene was originally isolated.Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the production of a
carbamoylase enzyme which has the capability of converting a D-N-carbamoyl
(optionally substituted phenyl)glycine into the corresponding D-(optionally
substituted phenyl)glycine by expressing recombinant DNA encoding a carbamoylase
gene in a homologous host.Preferably the homologous host is Agrobacterium ie the carbamoylase gene is
der
