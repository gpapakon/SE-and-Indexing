<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an N,N-disubstituted aminophenol, which comprises heat-treating an N-substituted-aminophenol-containing 
reeaction mixture obtained by reacting a dihydric phenol with an amine to thermally 

decompose the quaternary ammonium salt contained therein to convert it into the dihydric phenol and the amine, 
distilling off at least the amine, then separating high-boiling impurities by distillation to separate the N-substituted 

aminophenol, and reductively alkylating the separated N-substituted aminophenol with an aldehyde compound. A 
high-purity N,N-disubstituted aminophenol can be obtained in a high yield with a high selectivity, and the reduction 

catalyst can be repeatedly used, because it can retain its activity at a high level for a long period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
N,N-disubstituted aminophenol and, more specifically, to a
process for producing high-purity N,N-disubstituted
aminophenol at a high yield by aminating and alkylating a
dihydric phenol. N,N-disubstituted aminophenol is a
valuable compound as an intermediate for producing dyes
for heat-sensitive recording papers and fluorescent dyes.Known prior art processes for producing N,N-disubstituted
aminophenol include:
(1) a process which comprises reacting a dihydric
phenol with a primary amine in the presence of an acid
catalyst (first-stage reaction) and alkylating the
resulting N-substituted aminophenol with dialkylsulfuric
acid or an halogenated alkyl such as alkyl chloride, alkyl
bromide or alkyl iodide (second-stage reaction); and(2) a process which comprises aminating a dihydric
phenol with ammonia to produce an aminophenol, separating
and purifying the aminophenol, and adding aldehydes
stepwise to the aminophenol in the copresence of a
reduction catalyst, an organic carboxylic acid, an organic
solvent and hydrogen for reduction alkylation.However, in the process (1), an inorganic acid by-produced
in the second-stage alkylation reaction must be
neutralized and, hence, a large volume of waste water is
produced. When bromine or iodine are used as a halogen,
recovery of these halogens is necessary because they are
expensive, and the industrial production process becomes
complicated. Further, when dialkylsulfuric acid and a
halogenated alkyl are used, alkylation of an OH group
takes place and a quaternary salt is by-produced by 
aminophenol and alkylsulfuric acid, with a consequence the
yield of N,N-disubstituted aminophenol decreases and the
purification step becomes complicated.In the process (2), due to a low yield in the step of
aminating the dihydric phenol with ammonia, a large amount
of the dihydric phenol as a source material remains in the
reaction mixture and as a result a complicated step for
separating and purifying the resulting aminophenol is
required.A process for producing N-substituted aminophenol by
reacting a dihydric phenol with ammonia, primary amine or
secondary amine in the absence of a catalyst is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos.5416/1987 and
99042/1991.Further, a process for obtaining N,N-disubstituted
aminophenol by a reduction alkylation reaction between N-substituted
aminophenol and aldehyde in an organic solvent
in the presence of hydrogen and a reduction catalyst is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
