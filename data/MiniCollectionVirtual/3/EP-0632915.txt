<ABSTRACT>
Non-linear picture transformations in a video image motion compensation system are caused by camera zooms or rotations. Sets of trial vectors are derived for each block of the image representing peak correlation values between adjacent images in the sequence. A constant representing the non-linear transformation is estimated using the sets of trial vectors and this enables a vector representing the non-linear transformation to be added to the trial vector list for each block.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video image motion measurement and in
particular to such motion measurement when there is a camera zoom,
rotation, or some other non-linear translation between adjacent
fields of the video image.In our United Kingdom Patent No. GB-B-2188510 a method for TV
picture motion measurement is described in which a plurality of
motion vectors are derived for each of a plurality of measurement
blocks of a picture and from these a list of motion vectors is
derived which are applicable over the whole area of each block.
The process is then repeated over the whole area of the picture.
These vectors are derived using a phase correlation technique. One
of these is then assigned to each elementary area of each block of
the image. Other methods are also possible for generating such a
list of motion vectors, for example the block matching technique
described in European Patent Application No. EP-A-0395264. Each
elementary area of a region of the picture to which a vector is
assigned may be as small as a picture element (pixel) or it may
comprise a plurality of picture elements for a block of the
picture. The motion vectors thus derived may be used, for example,
to generate output fields at instants in time intermediate of the
time of two input fields. Such intermediate fields are required
when producing slow motion effects, when transferring video images
to or from film, or in standards conversion.The methods used for deriving the motion vectors have been found to
be highly satisfactory for stationary camera positions but have led
to problems when a zoom of the camera is involved or a rotation of
the camera about its viewing access. These problems have been 
particularly serious when such a zoom or rotation has been combined
with a camera pan and the methods for deriving the motion vectors
have in some cases broken down completely in these situations.Preferred embodiments of the present invention seek to provide a
machine method for extracting a motion component due to camera zoom
or rotation from the gross movements in a scene. The component for
each picture region will be proportional to the distance of that
region from a particular point in the image. This is achieved by
estimating a constant representing a non-linear transformation,
from sets of trial vectors and then adding a vector defining the
non-linear transformation to the trial vector list for each block.The invention is defined in the appended claims to which reference
should now be made.Preferred embodiments of the invention will
