<ABSTRACT>
A circuit structure for a matrix of EEPROM memory cells, 
being of a type which comprises a matrix of cells (2) 

including plural rows (3) and columns (4), with each row 
(3) being provided with a word line (WL) and a control gate 

line (CG) and each column (4) having a bit line (BL); the 
bit lines (BL), moreover, are gathered into groups or bytes 

(9) of simultaneously addressable adjacent lines. Each cell 
(2) in the matrix incorporates a floating gate transistor 

(12) which is coupled to a control gate (8), connected to 
the control gate line (CG), and is connected serially to a 

selection transistor (5); also, the cells (2) of each 
individual byte (9) share their respective source areas 

(6), which areas are structurally independent for each byte 
(9) and are led to a co
rresponding source addressing line 
(SL) extending along a matrix column (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit structure for a memory 
cells matrix. More particularly, the invention relates to a matrix of 
EEPROM memory cells being of a type which comprises a cells 
matrix composed of plural rows and columns, each provided 
with a word line and a bit line respectively, wherein the 
bit lines are gathered into groups or bytes of adjacent 
lines which are simultaneously addressable, each of said 
cells incorporating a floating gate transistor connected 
serially to a selection transistor and having an additional 
control gate overlaying the floating gate. As is well known, EEPROM memory structures, while being 
non-volatile types, allow the information contained therein 
to be modified electrically at both the write and the erase 
phases of their operation. Furthermore, they distinguish 
themselves by the kind of their electric programming, which 
may take place in either the "page" mode or the "byte" 
mode. In the former mode, all the cells in one row of the matrix 
are addressed at one time. In the latter mode, one byte 
only is addressed of the several available in one row. It is also known that the state of any cell in the EEPROM 
memory can be altered by means of an electrons flow passing 
by tunnel effect through a thin layer of silicon oxide 
associated with the floating gate of the cell. The thin 
oxide region occupies a smaller area than the floating 
gate, whereat the electric charge is stored.  
 There exist different types of EEPROM memory cells which 
are identifiable by the number of their polysilicon layers. In fact, there are cells with single, double, or treble 
layers of polysilicon. Most commonly employed are cells 
with two-level of polysilicon, known as FLOTOX cells; such 
cells are described, for instance, in an article "Oxide 
reliability criterion for the evaluation of endurance 
performance of electrically erasable programmable read-only 
memories", Journal App. Phys, 71, No. 9, 1992. Irrespective of the number of the polysilicon layers, for 
the write and erase phases of the cells, it is common 
practice to use positive voltages, applied to the diffusion 
underlying the tunnel region or the control gate. Such 
voltages vary between 8 and 18 Volts, in order to generate 
across the thin oxide an electric field which is 
sufficiently strong to positively trigger the tunnel 
effect. However, the use of such, comparatively high, positive 
voltages may result over time in the thin oxide layer being 
deteriorated, thereby damaging the cells and the whole 
memor
