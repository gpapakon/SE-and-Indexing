<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microwave generator, the microwave frequency of which is synchronised phase-locked by optical means by means of a reference frequency of a reference signal, at least one area of an electronic circuit arrangement of the microwave generator being supplied with an optical reference carrier signal which is modulated with the reference frequency. It is provided that the circuit arrangement (16) has two components (Q1 to Q6; Q10, Q11) based on different types of semiconductor, which are selected in such a manner that one first component belonging to a first type of semiconductor optically responds to the reference carrier signal (3) and thus to the reference frequency (f1;Mod1 ... Modn) for achieving synchronisation, and that the other second component belonging to a second type of semiconductor responds, independently of the response of the first component, to an optical control carrier signal (6) which deviates in frequency from the reference carrier signal (3) and the modulated-on control signal (7) of which is used for controlling the amplitude of the first component.
