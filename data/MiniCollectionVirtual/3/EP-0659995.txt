<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for determining
the air charge within the cylinders of a multi-cylinder
variable displacement internal combustion engine so as to
manage the air\fuel control needs of the engine.Automotive vehicle designers and manufacturers have
realised for years that it is possible to obtain increased
fuel efficiency if an engine can be operated on less than
the full complement of cylinders during certain running
conditions. Accordingly, at low speed, low load operation,
it is possible to save fuel if the engine can be run on four
instead of eight cylinders or three, instead of six
cylinders,
see e.g. US-S-4 550 704.
In fact, one manufacturer offered a 4-6-8
variable displacement engine several years ago, and Ford
Motor Company designed a 6-cylinder engine capable of
operation on only three cylinders which, although never
released for production, was developed to a highly refined
state. Unfortunately, both of the aforementioned engines
suffered from deficiencies associated with their control
strategies. Specifically, customer acceptance of the engine
system actually in production was unsatisfactory because the
power train tended to "hunt" or shift frequently between the
various cylinder operating modes. In other words, the
engine would shift from four to eight cylinder operation
frequently, while producing noticeable torque excursions.
This had the undesirable effect of causing the driver to
perceive excessive changes in transmission gear in the
nature of downshifting or upshifting. Another drawback to
prior art systems resided in the fact that the engine
emissions were not properly controlled because the air
charge within the cylinders was not predicted with any
accuracy. This deficiency adversely affected not only
emission control, but also fuel economy. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
system for determining the cylinder air charge of a variable
displacement engine, so as to allow finer control of the
air/fuel ratio. The present system advantageously allows
cylinder air charge to be predicted in sufficient time to
permit the supply of a correct quantity of fuel.A system for predicting cylinder air charge for a
throttled, variable displacement, reciprocating internal
combustion engine operating in a transition from a first
number of activated cylinders to a second number of
activated cylinders includes a throttle sensing system for
determining the effective flow area of the air intake
passage of the engine (AREAf), and for generating a signal
corresponding to
