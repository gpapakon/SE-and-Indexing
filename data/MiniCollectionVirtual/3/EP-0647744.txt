<ABSTRACT>
Reinforcement, in particular consisting of steel, for concrete structures at structural joints (28) in one and/or two concrete structural part(s) (1, 2, 26, 27), which steel reinforcement exhibits at least one receiving means (8, 21, 22) for a waterstop (9) consisting of rubber, plastic or the like, with a multiplicity of links (binders) (7, 19, 20, 31) which are arranged transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the waterstop and are connected via further reinforcements (12) oriented in the longitudinal direction of the waterstop, shuttering elements (13) which exhibit, in particular, perforations, e.g. made of expanded metal, perforated plates or the like, being arranged on both sides of the receiving means (8), and the links (7) bearing the shuttering elements (13) directly and/or via further reinforcements (12) which run in the longitudinal direction of the waterstop and are connected directly to the links (7, 19, 20, 31), and the links (7, 19, 20, 31) being designed integrally with the receiving means (8, 21, 22) and the region which exhibits the shuttering elements (13) and/or the further reinforcement (12) which bears the shuttering element or elements.

<CLAIMS>
Reinforcement, in particular of steel, for concrete
structures at design joints (28) in one and/or two

concrete components (1, 2, 26, 27), which reinforcement
exhibits at least one mounting (8, 21, 22, 32, 33) for a

joint waterstop (9) made of rubber, plastic or the like
with a plurality of binders (7, 19, 20, 31) which are

disposed adjoining the mounting transversely relative to
the longitudinal direction of the joint waterstop and

connected by means of further reinforcements (12)
orientated in the longitudinal direction of the joint

waterstop, whereby the formwork elements (13), which in
particular exhibit perforations, e.g. made of expanded

metal mesh, perforated plates or the like, are disposed on
both sides of the mounting (8), whereby the binders (7)

carry the formwork elements (13) directly and/or by means
of further reinforcements (12) which run in the

longitudinal direction of the joint waterstop and are
connected directly to the binders (7, 19, 20, 31), and the

binders (7, 19, 20, 31) are embodied in one piece with the
mounting (8, 21, 22, 32, 33) and the portion which

exhibits the formwork elements (13) and/or the further
reinforcement (12) carrying the formwork element or

elements (13).
Reinforcement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the mounting (8, 21, 22) for the joint waterstop (9)

is formed with a U-shaped or V-shaped portion of the
binders (7, 19, 20).
Reinforcement according to claim 2, characterised in
that the U-shaped or V-shaped portion of the mounting (8)

essentially corresponds to the transverse extension of the
joint waterstop. 
Reinforcement according to claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that on both sides of the U-shaped or V-shaped

portion (8) the binder (7) exhibits at least one
further U-shaped or V-shaped portion (10) which is

orientated towards the U or V in a mirror image and has a
further limb which runs transversely relative to the limbs

(11) of the U or V.
Reinforcement according to claim 4, characterised in
that the limbs (11) disposed transversely carry the

formwork elements (13).
Reinforcement according to claim 2, characterised in
that the U-shaped or V-shaped portions correspond to only

one part of the transverse extension of the joint
waterstop and at the ends of the U or V exhibit limbs

(23, 24) which run transversely relative to the joint
waterstop and carry the formwork elements (13)
Reinforcement according to claim 6, characterised in
that the part of the joint waterstop (9) projecting out of

the binder (19) is for its part surrounded by a U- shaped
or V-shaped portion (22) of a further binder (20) which

exhibits limbs (24) which are disposed transversely
relative to the longitudinal extension of the joint

waterstop (9).
Reinforcement according to claim 7, characterised in
that the further binders (20) are connected by means of

further reinforcements (12) running in the longitudinal
direction of the joint waterstop.
Reinforcement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the binde
r with roughly U-shaped or V-shaped portions
(31) exhibits limbs (32, 33) which are disposed in the

interior of the U or V, whereby a mounting for the joint
waterstop is formed with the two limbs (32, 33).
Reinforcement according to claim 9, characterised in
that the outer limbs (34, 35) of the U or V carry the

formwork elements (13). 
Reinforcement according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the mounting (8, 21, 22, 32, 33)

forms a clamp fit for the joint waterstop (9).
