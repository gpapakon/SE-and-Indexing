<ABSTRACT>
A water pump or motor comprises an outer casing (1), a cylinder block (7) which is rotatably mounted within the outer casing (1) and a plurality of piston assemblies (9). Each of the piston assemblies (9) is mounted within a respective piston bore in the cylinder block and comprises a piston (41) having a piston ball end supporting a slipper (42). An angled swash plate (12) is fixed in position relative to the rotatable cylinder block (7), against which the slippers (42) are pre-loaded. Each slipper (42) fits into and is held in place on the piston ball end by a retaining cap (47). The retaining caps (47) are each held in position on their respective piston ball end by means of a retaining ring (13) which is angled at the same angle as the angled swash plate. The retaining ring (13) has a plurality of apertures therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONWATER PUMPS AND MOTORSThe present invention relates to water pumps and motors, and more especially to a piston assembly for use therein. The present invention also provides a water driven power tool.A known water pump comprises an outer casing, a cylindrical cylinder block keyed to a drive shaft and a plurality of piston assemblies each mounted within a respective bore in the cylinder block. Each piston assembly comprises a piston which is slidable back and forth within its bore, and a slipper which is mounted on a ball at the end of the piston. The slippers are supported against an angled swash plate which is fixed in position relative to the rotatable cylinder block. At the other end of the cylinder block from the angled swash plate there is provided a port plate which is fixed in position relative to the rotatable cylinder block and which comprises an inlet port and an outlet port. Water to be pumped is supplied to the water pump through the inlet port and is expelled therefrom under pressure from the outlet port.In use, the cylinder block is rotatably driven by means of a prime mover connected to the drive shaft.As each piston bore passes into alignment with the inlet port water flows or is sucked into the bore, displacing the piston along the length of the bore 

 against the angle of the swash plate. At a given point the bore passes out of alignment with the inlet port, thus closing off the bore with a quantity of water in it. As the cylinder block continues to rotate each slipper passes up the angled swash plate which forces the associated piston back against the volume of water in its respective piston bore and increases the pressure in the piston bore. At this point the piston bore passes into alignment with the outlet port and water is expelled therefrom under pressure. Thus water entering the pump at low pressure is pumped out at high pressure.The water pump described hereinabove can also function as a water motor. Water under high pressure is applied to the inlet port, which has the effect of driving each of the pistons in turn down its respective piston bore andr in turn, of turning the cylinder block and the drive shaft. It is, of course, essential to the effective operation of the water pump/motor that contact is maintained between the pistons and slippers. In one known arrangement a primary or boost pump usually supplies pressurised water to the pump suction. This has the effect of pushing each piston down the bore as it comes into suction, thus maintaining contact between

CLAIMS
1. A water pump or motor comprising an outer casing, a cylinder block which is rotatably mounted within the outer casing, a plurality of piston assemblies, each of which is mounted within a respective piston bore in the cylinder block and each of which comprises a piston body having a piston ball end supporting a slipper, and an angled swash plate which is fixed in position relative to the rotatable cylinder block and against which the slippers are pre- loaded, wherein each slipper fits into and is held in place on the piston ball end by a retaining cap and wherein the retaining caps are each held in position on their respective piston ball end by means of a retaining ring having a plurality of apertures therein, each of which receives and secures a respective retaining cap, which retaining ring is angled at the same angle as the angled swash plate.
2. A water motor or pump according to claim 1, wherein the retaining cap is retained on the piston ball end by means of a split ring or retaining bush which passes over the piston ball end.
3. A water motor or pump according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the retaining cap comprises a tubular body with an outwardly extending circumferential flange at 


 - 18 - one end and the said tubular body is seated in a respective one of the said apertures in the retaining ring and is held in place by the said circumferential flange; the piston ball end and the retaining bush are 5 received in the opposite end of the tubular body from the flange; the slipper fits into the flanged end of the tubular body.
4. A water pump or motor according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the retaining ring is maintained at the
10 same angle as the swash plate by means of a keep ring wedge.
5. A water pump or motor according to claim 4, wherein the keep ring wedge is an annular member having a wedged cross section and is fixed in position behind
15 the annular retaining ring.
6. A water pump or motor according to any preceding claim, wherein a wave spring is provided behind the retaining ring which spring biases it towards the swash plate, thus pre-loading the retaining
20 caps mounted therein.
7. A water driven power tool comprising a water motor.
8. A water driven power tool according to claim 7 comprising a drilling rig having a hollow combined bit
25 and sprayer which is rotatably driven by the water 


motor, and switching means for switching water under pressure from the water motor into the hollow combined bit and sprayer so that water under pressure sprays out therefrom. 9. A water driven power tool according to claim 7 or 8, comprising a water motor according to any one of claims 1 to 6.
