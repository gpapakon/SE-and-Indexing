<ABSTRACT>
A child resistant closure (CRC) of the type having an inner 
cap (2) and an outer cap (4), the caps having between them an 

off-screwing 
drive mechanism which is strong, reliable and 

compact. The inner cap (2) is provided with a central 
projection (18), which may be hexagonal, and which engages a 

recess (32) in the outer cap, and ribs (20) which extend radially from 
the central projection on the inner cap. The recess is 

defined by a number of abutments (30) on the outer cap which also 
engage the driving ribs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child resistant closure (CRC) of 
the type having an inner cap and an outer cap, the inner cap 
being of smaller dimensions than the outer cap and fitting 
inside same to form the closure. Once such a closure is applied to a container by an on-screwing 
action, the container is again accessable only in 
the hands of a user who is able to apply axial pressure onto 
the closure whilst transmitting an off-screwing force 
thereto. Children are generally unable to combine these 
actions, and thus the container, which may contain 
potentially harmful medicines or chemicals, is rendered child 
resistant. Closures of this type are well known, however existing 
closures generally lack durability and can be unreliable due 
to the failure or malfunctioning of the drive mechanisms 
between the caps, which can prevent removal of a closure from 
a container. Due to the nature of the contents of a container which will 
be provided with a CRC, it is furthermore desirable to 
provide the CRC with a tampering indicator which shows when 
the off-screwing drive means has been actuated, and therefore 
that a first time consumer can tell whether the closure has 
been tampered with, in particular removal of the closure from 
the container. There are however difficulties in the provision of a variety 
of co-operating formations between the inner and outer caps, 
including the delicacy, bulkiness and failure tendency of the 
drive mechanism, particularly when a further, on-screwing 
drive means is provided.  An attempt has been made to overcome these difficulties by 
the provision of a hexagonal spigot on the inner cap of a 
CRC, in combination with an orifice of corresponding shape on 
the outer cap. It has however been found that occasionally 
such a drive mechanism will fail as the corners of the 
hexagonal spigot are worn down through use. It is also 
possible, due to the near-circularity of the spigot outline, 
to cause the mechanism to lock if the outer cap is pushed 
down with force while the spigot and orifice are not properly 
aligned. The present invention seeks to alleviate the 
abovementioned problems, by the provision of a CRC which is 
both hard wearing, reliable and compact. According to the present invention there is provided a 
closure for a container, comprising an inner cap and an outer 
cap, the inner cap being received and held within the outer 
cap by a retention means to form the closure and there being 
provided an off-screwing drive means between the caps, in 
which the caps

<CLAIMS>
A closure for a container, comprising an inner cap and an 
outer cap, the inner cap being received and held within the 

outer cap by a retention means to form the closure and there 
being provided an off-screwing drive means between the caps, 

in which the caps are relatively displacable against a 
biasing force provided by biasing means between the caps by 

means of manual pressure applied to the outer cap between a 
rest position, wherein the outer cap is freely rotatable with 

respect to the inner cap when turned in an off-screwing 
direction, the said drive means being disengaged, and an 

active position at which the biasing force has been overcome 
and wherein the said drive means is engaged to allow the 

closure to be unscrewed from a container to which it is 
applied, the said drive means comprising:- 


a) a central projection on one cap which engages a recess or 
orifice on the other cap; and 
b) one or more ribs located around the central projection 
which ribs are engaged by abutments on the other cap, 
 
characterised in that the said rib-engaging abutments are 

arranged to at least partially define the said recess or 
orifice. 
A closure according to claim 1 wherein the said central 
projection and said one or more ribs are connected to form a 

one-piece projection located on an end surface of one of the 
caps. 
A closure according to claim 2 wherein the said one-piece 
projection is located on the outer surface of the inner cap. 
A closure according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the 
central projection has a polygonal outline. 
A closure according to claim 4 wherein the said ribs 
project radially from the centre of the polygonal faces of 

the central projection. 
A closure according to claim 4 or 5 wherein the said 
abutments are V-shaped so as to drivingly interengage the 

corner portions of the polygonal central projection. 
A closure according to any of claims 1 to 6 wherein the 
said ribs have portions which cooperate with ratchet means 

positioned on the other cap to provide a further, on-screwing 
drive means which is engagable in the rest position of the 

caps. 
A closure according to claim 7 wherein the rib portions 
engaging the ratchet means are stepped in height. 
A closure according to claim 7 or 8 wherein the said 
ratchet means consist of spring fingers extending from the 

lower surface of the outer cap. 
A closure according to any of claims 1 to 9 wherein the 
inner cap comprises a central cylindrical spigot which 

cooperates with a tamper indicator on the outer cap. 
A closure according to claim 10 wherein the tamper 
indicator is in the form of a central orifice on the outer 

cap initially closed by a cover portion connected to the body 
of the outer cap by frangible means or such like.
