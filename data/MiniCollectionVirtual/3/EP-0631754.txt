<ABSTRACT>
A bath tub (1) is equipped with a bath panel (5) carried 
on a holder mechanism (6, 7), the holder mechanism being 

movable so that the bath panel (5) can be positioned between 
a normal position for screening the bath tub and a raised 

position for accessing the space beneath the bath tub (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bath tub and panel arrangement of the 
kind referred to in the preamble of claim 1 and 
to a bath panel arrangement for such a bath arrangement. It is known to provide a bath arrangement with a detachable bath 
panel along a side of the bath tub. However, with a 
conventional detachable bath panel, if it is desired to access 
the space behind the bath panel and under the bath tub, for 
example for tidying and cleaning purposes, it is necessary to 
completely detach the bath panel from the bath tub and to lay 
it aside. Because a bath side panel is typically fairly large 
and may be relatively heavy, it is difficult to lift the bath 
panel completely clear of the bath tub. Furthermore there is 
not always enough space for the removed bath panel which can 
easily hit the floor and/or walls of, or equipment in, the 
bathroom causing them damage. As a result, tidying up and 
cleaning behind the bath panel of a bath tub are in practice 
done too seldom. A known bath tub and panel arrangement of the kind referred to 
is disclosed in DE-A-4 009 921. This known bath arrangement 
allows the bath panel to be pivoted forward but does not allow 
the panel subsequently to be raised whilst still remaining 
attached to the holder mechanism. An object of the present invention is to provide a bath tub and 
panel arrangement comprising a bath 
tub and a bath panel which can be raised with 
some simple movements to a position that allows free access 
to the space beneath the bath tub. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
bath tub and panel arrangement as claimed in the ensuing claim 1. Because the bath panel is not completely detached from 
its holder mechanism but is only subjected to a restricted 
guided motion, it is easy to raise the bath panel to a tidying 
position and subsequently to bring it back to its normal 
screening position. Because the bath panel is all the time 
guided by its holder mechanism, there is no risk that the bath 
panel will cause damage in the bathroom, which can easily 
occur with conventional panels which have to be lifted 
completely clear of the bath tub and laid aside.  
 In a preferred embodiment of the invention the holder 
mechanism comprises at least one, preferably two, arm 
assemblies which are pivotally mounted at their lower ends so 
that, by changing their angular position, the upper edge of 
the bath panel is moved outwardly from the bath tub. Because 
the outwards movement required for releasing the bath 
panel from the edge of the

<CLAIMS>
A bath tub and panel arrangement including a bath tub (1), a 
movable bath panel (5) and a holder mechanism carrying the 

bath panel (5) and turnable about an axis in fixed relation 
to the bath tub (1), characterised in that the arrangement 

includes means for maintaining connection of the bath panel 
(5) to the holder mechanism during movement of the bath 

panel and in that said holder mechanism includes release 
means (10-13) for releasing an upper edge of the bath panel 

(5) for movement from an inner position to a folded out 
outer position laterally outside the edge of the bath tub 

(1), and lifting means for restricted guided raising and 
lowering of the bath panel (5) between said outer position 

and a raised position outwardly of the edge of the bath tub 
(1) and giving free access to space beneath the bath tub 

(1). 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the holder mechanism comprises at 

least one, preferably two, arm assemblies (6,7) which are attached 
at their lower ends and which, by changing their angular 

positions, allow the upper edge of the bath panel (5) to be 
moved between said inner and outer positions. 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that said lifting means includes guide 

means which allow upwards movement of the bath panel (5) by 
means of a guided sliding motion either between elements of 

the holder mechanism or between the bath panel (5) and the 
holder mechanism. 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that latching means 

(14,15) are provided either as part of the holder mechanism 
or arranged between the bath panel (5) and the holder 

mechanism for releasably locking the panel in its raised 
position.  

 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the release means 

includes a mechanism (13) for restricting the motion at the 
upper edge of the bath panel (5) in a direction outwardly 

from the bath tub (1). 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the holder mechanism 

includes a spring (9) or another member arranged to at least 
partially compensate the weight of the bath panel (5) and 

preferably also to provide a resilient biasing force for a 
latch mechanism keeping the bath panel (5) in its normal 

attached position in relation to the bath tub (1). 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the holder mechanism 

includes two elements slidable relative to one another, one 

of said elements being fixed in the slide direction relative 
to the bath tub (1) and the other of said slide elements 

being fixed relative to the bath panel (5). 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the holder mechanism 

is attached to, or receives support from, at least one foot 
structure (2,3) supporting the bath tub (1). 
A bath tub and panel arrangement according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the bath panel (5) 

is a side panel positioned along one side of the bath tub 
(1). 
A bath panel arrangement for a bath tub (1), 
comprising a support structure for the bath tub (1), a 

holder mechanism turnable relative to the support structure 
about an axis, and a movable bath panel (5) carried by the 

holder mechanism, characterised in that the panel 
arrangement includes means for maintaining connection of the 

bath panel to the holder mechanism during movement of the 
bath panel (5) and in that the holder mechanism includes  

 
release means (10-13) for releasing an upper edge of the 

bath panel for movement from an inner position to a folded 
out outer position and lifting means for restricted guided 

raising and lowering movement of the bath panel between said 
outer position and a raised position.
