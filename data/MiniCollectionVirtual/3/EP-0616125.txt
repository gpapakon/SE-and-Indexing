<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for pumping liquid from a tank, particularly for pumping fuel from a vehicle tank, characterised by the fact that it comprises: an access hatch (20) formed in one wall (12) of the tank (10), a generally vertical well (100, 200) fixed to the wall (12) of the tank (10), level with the access hatch (20), which well (100, 200) descends at least substantially as far as the lower wall (14) of the tank (10), at least one flexible pipe (310, 320) connected by a first end to the base of the well (100, 200) and which, via its second end, forms a pumping point which is remote from the base of the well (100, 200), and an elastic stiffener (500) associated with the flexible pipe (310, 320) in order to keep the latter firmly against the lower wall (14) of the tank (10), at rest, whilst allowing a deformation of the flexible pipe (310, 320) when the device is inserted into the tank (10) via the hatch (10).

Device for pumping liquids in a tank, 
particularly for pumping fuel in a vehicle tank, 

comprising: 

an access door (20) formed in a wall (12) of 
tank (10), 
a well (100, 200), generally vertical, said 
well (100, 200) entering at least substantially to 

the bottom wall (14) of the tank (10), 
at least one flexible pipe (310, 320), 
connected by a first end to the bottom of the well 

(100, 200), and which, at its second end, forms a 
pumping point remote from the bottom of the well 

(100, 200), characterized in that it comprises: 
an elastic stiffener (500) associated with 
the flexible pipe (310, 320), to hold the pipe firmly 

in contact with the bottom wall (14) of the tank (10) 
at rest, while allowing the flexible pipe (310, 320) 

to be deformed when the device is inserted into the 
tank (10) through door (20), the well (100, 200) 

being fixed on the wall (12) of the tank (10) at the 
access door (20). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the elastic stiffener (500) is formed of an 

elastic thread. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the elastic thread (500) comprises essentially two 

strands: a first strand (510) which extends in a  
 

general direction perpendicular to the direction 
connecting the bottom of the vertical well (100, 200) 

to the second end of flexible pipe (310, 320) and a 
second strand (520) essentially parallel to the latter 

direction. 
Device according to any of claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the elastic thread surrounds the 

flexible pipe (310, 320). 
Device according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the elastic thread (500) is 

fitted with low-noise runners (550, 552). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the well (100, 200) comprises 

main pumping means (200) at its bottom provided with a 
reserve (250) and the flexible pipe (310, 320) defines 

a secondary pumping means (400) which opens into said 
reserve (250). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the main pumping means (200) comprise a pump 

(210), the inlet (211) of which dips into the reserve 
(250), and are fitted with a branch connection (214) at 

its outlet or at an intermediate pressure stage, to 
supply a jet pump (220) picking up fuel in the tank 

(14) to feed the reserve (250). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the flexible pipe (310, 320) is 

provided with secondary pumping means (420) controlled 
by the fuel return pipe (114) from the engine. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the secondary pumping means comprise a jet pump  

 
(400) controlled by the fuel return pipe (114) from the 

engine. 
Device to claim 8, characterized in that the 
secondary pumping means comprise a jet pump (400) 

controlled by a branch connection taken from the outlet 
or at an intermediate pressure stage of a main pump 

(210). 
Device according to any of claims 7 to 10, 
characterized in that the jet pump (220, 400) is 

provided with a non-return valve at its inlet opening. 
Device according to any of claims 7 to 10, 
characterized in that the outlet pipe from the jet pump 

(220, 400) communicates with a tubing placed in the 
reserve (250) and which discharges into it at a height 

well above its bottom. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the well (100, 200) is provided 

with level gauge means (600). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the well (100) supports main 

pumping means (200) and urges these against the bottom 
(14) of the tank. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the elastic stiffener (500) and 

the associated flexible pipe (310, 320) are mounted in 
rotation about a vertical axis on the well (100).
