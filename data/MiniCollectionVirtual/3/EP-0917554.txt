<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating
compositions containing fluorinated esters of
unsaturated alcohols that provide durable oil- and
water-repellent surfaces to the cured coating, and
the cured coatings derived from such compositions.The coating compositions of interest in the
present invention are alkyd coating compositions, Type I
urethane coating compositions, and unsaturated polyester
resin coating compositions, typically a paint, clear
coat or stain. All the above-listed coating compositions
after drying or curing show low hexadecane contact
angles, are readily wetted by oil, and are susceptible
to soiling. The coating compositions are described in
Outlines of Paint Technology, Halstead Press, New York
NY, Third edition, 1990) and Surface Coatings Vol. I,
Raw Materials and Their Usage (Chapman and Hall, New
York NY, Second Edition, 1984). A common factor in these
coating compositions is an unsaturated resin or
prepolymer structure that permits the polymerization of
olefinic groups in the backbone or sidechain, such that
added fluorinated esters of unsaturated alcohols can be
incorporated in the structure.Conventional alkyd coatings utilize, as the
binder or film-forming component, a curing or drying
alkyd resin. Alkyd resin coating compositions contain
unsaturated aliphatic acids derived from drying oils.
These resins spontaneously polymerize in the presence of
oxygen or air to yield a solid protective film. The
polymerization is termed "drying" or "curing" and occurs
as a result of autoxidation of the unsaturated carbon-carbon
bonds in the aliphatic acid component of the oil
by atmospheric oxygen. When applied to a surface as a 
thin liquid layer of formulated alkyd coating, the cured
films that form are relatively hard, non-melting, and
substantially insoluble in many organic solvents that
act as solvents or thinners for the unoxidized alkyd
resin or drying oil. Such drying oils have been used for
centuries as raw materials for oil-based coatings and
are described widely in the literature.Urethane coatings are classified by ASTM D-1
into five categories. Type I urethane coatings contain
a pre-reacted autoxidizable binder as described in
Surface Coatings Vol. I, previously cited. Type I
urethane binders, also termed urethane oils, oil-modified
polyurethanes, or urethane alkyds, are the
largest volume category of polyurethane coatings, and
include typical paints, clear coatings and stains.
Urethane coatings typically contain the reaction product
of a polyisocyanate, usually toluene diisocyanate, and
