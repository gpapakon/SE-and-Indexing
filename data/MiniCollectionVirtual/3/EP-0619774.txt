<ABSTRACT>
A process for the partially coating of articles, in particular backs (1) of brooms, with a layer (9) of thermoformable plastic material. The articles (1) are introduced in a chamber (6) of a thermoforming machine (5) and arranged on a supporting plane (7) under a heat radiating panel (8). A plate of thermoformable material is put on the articles and by the action of the heat radiated by the panel (8) and under vacuum condition the plate melts forming a layer which wraps the articles (1) almost completely. The coating layer (9) thus formed after deformation maintains its colour and brightness and inscription and fancy drawings can also be printed on it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to the 
field of the plastic materials processing and more 
precisely it relates to an article such as a broom back. In the production of articles made either of plastic 
or other material much attention is paid to both 
mechanical features, such as lightness and strength, and 
aesthetic features, such as the degree of surface 
finishing, brightness, coulour and presence of drawings 
and/or decorations on the article surface. Very often, 
however, materials with excellent mechanical features do 
not exhibit so good aesthetic features. In these cases 
the articles are coated with films or layers of material 
of a different type and more satisfactory from the 
aesthetic point of view. Such a coating is disclosed in EP-A-0 302 703. Among the articles for which mechanical and aesthetic 
qualities are an essential requirement, there are in 
particular the backs of brooms. A broom back 
substantially consists of an elongated body made of wood 
or plastic to a face of which cleaning bristles are set, 
while to the other face a threaded support is formed for 
engagement with the end of a long handle. In order to 
save the production costs and to make easier the 
application of the cleaning bristles, the back is 
generally made of plastic material such as polypropylene 
both of the compact and the foam type. In the first case 
the back is heavier, but exhibits a satisfactory surface  
 
finishing, while in the second case, which is the less 
expensive one, the back is lighter but the surface 
finishing is very poor. In both cases, the backs made of 
these materials and of similar materials are covered by 
applying plastic masks produced separately and snap 
fitted to them. The mask covering system is expensive 
because two moulds are necessary one for the back and one 
for the mask. The backs made of foam polypropylene may 
also be painted; however, to allow the painting to adhere 
to the surface, a preliminary treatment with a solvent 
must be carried out, thereby the production cost is 
further increased. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
article such as a broom back coated with a covering which 
is unexpensive and easy to exploit, and capable of 
produce a high surface finishing and brightness coating 
with the possibility of obtaining decorations and fancy 
drawings on it even in different colours. The above objects are reached with the article such as 
a broom back according to the invention coated with a 
covering comprising a layer of
