<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thread wound golf
ball having a liquid center which is composed of a rubber
bag containing a liquid. Such a ball is known from GB-A-483977.In general, professional golfers or advanced golfers
like thread wound golf balls because of their high impact
resilience, good shot feel and excellent spin
performances. However, it has hitherto been considered
that thread wound golf balls are not suitable for amateur
golfers who require a long flight distance because their
flight distance is inferior in comparison with two-piece
golf balls.In respect of thread wound golf balls, since the amount of
back spin applied to the golf ball when hit is large, a
lifting power is liable to act on the golf ball. In the
process immediately after launching at which the velocity
of the golf ball is high, flight power and lift power
of the golf ball is strong and a golf ball which is launched at a
low launching angle is blown up. The velocity of this golf
ball is gradually reduced due to air pressure or resistance
during flight. At this stage, the spinning ratio is reduced
and the lifting force of the golf ball is reduced. 
Accordingly, the trajectory of the golf ball begins to
drop rapidly as the lifting force and projectile force
decrease. That is, the landing angle thereof is large and the rolling
distance thereof is small. This is the cause of low flight
distance in comparison with two-piece golf balls.In the ideal golf ball, the launch angle is high, the
initial velocity is large, the amount of spin is small and
a suitable lifting force acts on the golf ball.
Therefore, the golf ball reaches the peak point gently
without blowing up, and then begins to drop. It is
preferred that the amount of spin is large (i.e. the
lifting force is large) and the golf ball is not easily
dropped at this time.Heretofore, the weight of golf balls has been concentrated in the
center part thereof to reduce the moment of inertia such that spin
is easily applied tothe golf ball. The diameter of the center of
the golf ball is merely defined as 25 to 29 mm empirically,
as described in "Rubber Industry Handbook". The moment of
inertia is small and spin is easily applied to the golf ball,
and there is a limit in flight distance.Therefore, the thread wound golf ball which can
accomplish a long flight distance has hitherto been
required. In this case, it is considered that the initial
velocity of the golf ball can be increased by employing
rubber thread having high impact resilience. However, the 
initial velocity of the
