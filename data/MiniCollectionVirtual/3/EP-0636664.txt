<ABSTRACT>
A phthalocyanine of Formula (1): 

wherein: 

M
k
Pc
is a phthalocyanine nucleus of Formula (2): 

M
is a metal atom, a chloro-metal group, and oxy-metal group 
or hydrogen; 
k
is inverse of ½ valency of M; 
R and R¹
each independently is an organic radical; 
R²
is H or optionally substituted alkyl; 
a
is an average value from 15 to 8; 
b
is an average value from 1 to 8; and 
a+b

absorbing electro-magnetic radiation from for example a laser source 

and may be used in a coating for optical data storage disks, or in 
security applications such as printing banknotes or cheques, or in the  

 
preparation
 of lithographic printing plates or in washing powders to 
assist in bleaching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phthalocyanines, particularly to phthalocyanines having
arylthio and arylamino substituents, more particularly to those having copper, manganese or
iron as the central metal atom and to a process for preparing such phthalocyanines.EP-A 0519423 (Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals) describes phthalocyanines substituted
with complex groups comprising a plurality of oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms.EP-A 0484019 (ICI) describes phthalocyanines substituted with aryloxy and arylthio
groups.Neither of these documents disclose the compounds of the present invention or
suggest, either alone or in combination, how to modify the compounds disclosed therein to
achieve the desired properties of compounds of the present invention.According to the present invention there is provided a phthalocyanine of Formula
(1):

wherein:
MkPcis a phthalocyanine nucleus of Formula (2):
Mis a metal atom, a chloro-metal group, and oxy-metal group or hydrogen;kis inverse of ½ valency of M;R and R1each independently is an organic radical;R2is H or optionally substituted alkyl;ais an average value from 15 to 8;bis an average value from 1 to 8; and a+bis from 15 to 16; and
sulphonated derivatives thereof;Preferred phthalocyanines of the present invention are those which have a
maximum absorbance (λmax) from 800 to 1000nm, more preferably from 800 to 900nm. The phthalocyanine nucleus may be metal free i.e. M is
hydrogen, or it may be complexed with a metal, a halo-metal group or an
oxy-metal group. Suitable metals, halo-metal groups and oxy-metal
groups are those of Groups IA, IIA, IIIB, IVB, those of the 1st, 2nd
and 3rd transition metals and the lanthanide series of the Periodic
Table. Preferred metals, halo-metal groups and oxy-metal groups are
those in which the metal is selected from, copper, manganese, iron,
zinc, cobalt, aluminium and titanium, more preferably those selected
from copper, manganese, iron, zinc and cobalt and especially copper.In halo-metal groups suitable halo atoms are -Cl, -F, -Br
and -I preferably -Cl, -F and -Br giving a halo-metal group, where for
example Al is the metal, of Formula AlCl, such a halo metal group co-ordinates
with two positions of the phthalocyanine nucleus.In oxy-metal groups the oxy is oxygen or hydroxy providing
for example where Al is the metal an oxy-metal group such as AlOH, or
where Ti is the metal an oxy-metal group such as TiO, such oxy-metal
groups co-ordinate with two positions of the phthalocyanine nucleus.It is preferred that R and R1 each independently is
selected
