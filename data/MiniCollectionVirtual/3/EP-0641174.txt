<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
electrode system enabling repeated use of gel-free
electrodes and is useful for monitoring electrical
impulses of
a body depending upon the size of the electrode, among
other factors.As an example, electrocardiograph (EKG) and
electroencephalograph (EEG) devices for monitoring
electrical impulses generally require small contact
surfaces with a patient's skin.Prior art electrodes have utilized a number of
conductive elements, such as carbon impregnated rubber
and vinyl, as well as metallic foils. However, a useful electrode must be flexible in
order to accommodate relative movement of the
patient's skin therebeneath.In order to electrically couple the electrode to
the skin, prior art devices have utilized many types
of conductive electrolytes, both in the form of fluids
and gels.One type of electrode used for temporary
application of muscle stimulation includes a flat,
smooth contacting surface and a separate conductive
grease or gel is applied to the skin to electrically
couple the electrode thereto. Experience with this
system has shown that the grease or gel is messy to
use and remove and the electrodes are not suitable for
curved body parts. After use the grease or gel must be
cleaned or washed from the skin and electrode.Another type of electrode most suitable for
longer term application of electrical stimulation or
monitoring includes a flexible conductive fabric or
material.Typically, this type of electrode includes an
electrically conductive woven, knit or mesh material
with a gel electrolyte impregnated therein in order
to improve electrical conduction within the
electrode.In most instances, this conductive gel is adhesive
in nature so that it may perform a dual function
by both electrically coupling the electrode to the
body and adhering the electrode to the body. A
typical electrode of this kind is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,708,149 and 4,722,354. These electrodes
include a conductive fabric with a flexible conductive
adhesive disposed on one side of the conductive fabric
for adhering the flexible transcutaneous electrical
nerve and/or muscle stimulation electrode to the skin
of a patient.Since most of the known electrodes are disposable
in nature and useful for only relatively short periods
of time, due to removal for body hygiene, a considerable
expense may be anticipated in the treatment of a
patient.The present invention is directed to an economical
electrode system in which the basic electroconducting
and electrical distribution portion
