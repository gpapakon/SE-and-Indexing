<ABSTRACT>
A flow reducer device (14) particularly 
useful as a drip irrigation emitter includes a body 

member (16) having a flow regulating region (26) formed 
with a cavity (44) extending through the body member 

(16) and closed at its opposite sides by a deformable 
diaphragm, preferably an elastomeric sleeve (18). The 

device (14) is attachable to a tube (10) of pressurized 
fluid such that the outer face of each diaphragm side is 

exposed to the fluid pressure at the fluid inlet, and 
the inner face of each diaphragm side is exposed to the 

fluid pressure within the cavity (44), such that the 
diaphragm sides deform towards or away from each other 

within the cavity (44) to regulate the fluid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flow reducer 
devices for reducing the flow of a fluid under pressure. 
The invention is particularly useful for drip irrigation 
emitters and is therefore described below with respect to 
this application. Drip irrigation systems are gaining widespread use 
for irrigating various types of crops because of their 
ability to feed the irrigating water directly to the root 
region of the crops. Many designs have been developed to 
regulate the output of such emitters in order to decrease 
variations in the output flow with variations in the inlet 
pressure, thereby enabling the drip irrigation emitters to 
be used in long spans and/or over uneven terrain. Many 
designs have also been developed to reduce the sensitivity 
of the emitters to clogging by particles within the 
irrigating water, thereby enabling the emitters to be used 
with lower grade irrigation water. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a flow reducer device attachable to a tube of 
pressurized fluid for reducing the flow of the fluid 
therefrom, comprising: a body member formed with a fluid 
inlet, a fluid outlet, and a flow regulating region between 
the inlet and outlet; characterized in that the flow 
regulating region includes a cavity extending through 
opposite faces of the body member closed by a side of a 
deformable diaphragm at each of the opposite faces; the body 
member being further formed with an inlet passageway leading 
from the fluid inlet into the cavity, and an outlet 
passageway leading from the cavity to the fluid outlet; the 
device being attachable to the tube of pressurized fluid 
such that the outer face of each diaphragm side is exposed 
to the fluid pressure at the fluid inlet, and the inner face 
of each diaphragm side is exposed to the fluid pressure  
 
within the cavity, whereby the diaphragm sides deform 
towards or away from each other within the cavity in 
response to changes in the inlet pressure to regulate the 
fluid flow via the cavity to the outlet passageway. In the described preferred embodiments, the 
deformable diaphragm is in the form of a sleeve of 
elastomeric material to enclose the body member cavity. As will be described more particularly below, the 
provision of a flow-regulating cavity closed by a deformable 
diaphragm, preferably in the form of an elastomeric sleeve, 
effectively regulates the flow through the outlet passageway 
in response to variations in the inlet pressure. Such a 
construction also has a low sensitivity to clogging
