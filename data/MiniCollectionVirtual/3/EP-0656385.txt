<ABSTRACT>
A wholly aromatic polyester having excellent moldability, heat resistance and blistering resistance and a 
composition thereof are obtained from an aromatic polyester composed of six specified types of structural unit and 

having an optical melt anisotropy. The composition can provide electronic heater parts and ovenware both excellent 
in mechanical strength, heat resistance, moldability and microwave oven resistance, and various other heat-resistant 

members. Molded articles made from this composition can be coated with fluororesin without the necessity for 

pretreatment such as heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic 
material of a novel wholly aromatic polyester which has a 
high elastic coefficient, fluidity and heat resistance. 
More particularly, the invention relates to an organic 
material as a polymer having a specific composition and it 
has a high elastic coefficient which is realize by orienting 
the chains of molecules in the direction of the flow of 
material in a fluidized condition. Furthermore, the present invention relates to 
component parts of electronic heating devices and oven ware 
which are made from the wholly aromatic polyester and are 
excellent in mechanical strength, heat resistance, 
moldability, workability and anti-electronic oven-range 
characteristics. The term electronic heating devices herein 
referred to includes, as described later, electronic ovens, 
electronic ranges and electronic oven-ranges. The present invention further relates to articles 
which are made of a heat resistant wholly aromatic polyester 
and are coated with fluorocarbon resin such as  
 
polyfluoroethylene. Some plastic materials such as polymethylterpene 
and polysulfone are used for making cooking ware which is 
used in microwave ovens or electronic oven-ranges and 
component parts of electronic oven-ranges. The methods of heating in the electronic 
oven-ranges are exemplified by range heating with the 
irradiation of microwaves and oven heating with hot air 
blasting and grill heating with infrared lamps. The cooking 
ware used in electronic oven-ranges and several component 
parts of electronic oven-ranges are required to have various 
properties such as excellent heat resistance, chemical 
resistance and desirable external appearance. Especially, 
concerning the heat resistance, very severe characteristic 
property is required because the parts or cooking ware are 
exposed not only to the high-frequency heat but also to the 
heat of oven heating or grill heating. For example, the 
temperature in an electronic oven-ranges is generally about 
260°C and, in the case of oven heating, the temperature 
becomes partially about 300°C and, in the case of grill 
heating, the temperature sometimes becomes above 300°C. 
Accordingly, the articles used for this purpose must not be 
deformed and must have sufficient mechanical strength in 
practical uses. The wholly aromatic polyester has excellent  
 
properties due to its structure. Especially, in view of the 
heat resistance, it is the best one among all sorts of 
resins. The wholly aromatic polyesters which are prepared 
fro
