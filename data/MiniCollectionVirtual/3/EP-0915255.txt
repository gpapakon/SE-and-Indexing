<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a fuel injector comprises the
steps of applying a test waveform to a solenoid coil of the

injector to cause a response by an armature assembly and
measuring the response of the armature assembly while the

test waveform is applied to the solenoid coil. A control
waveform for the injector is developed as a function of the

variation of the measured response of the armature from a
selected operational characteristic. The developed control

waveform is thereafter applied to the solenoid coil to
cause the armature assembly to approach a nominal position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fuel
injectors, and more particularly to a method of operating
a fuel injector which may have characteristics that vary
from nominal.In an engine fuel system having a plurality of fuel
injectors, it is typically desirable that all of the
injectors have substantially identical injector operational
characteristics. In the past, it was recognized that each
injector should deliver approximately the same quantity of
fuel and approximately the same timed relationship to the
engine for proper operation. If the timing of the
injectors diverged beyond acceptable limits, problems would
be encountered due to the generation of different torques
between cylinders. Further, knowledge that such variations
in injector characteristics are inevitable require engine
system designers to account for this variability.
Accordingly, many engine systems are designed not for peak
or maximum cylinder pressures or output, but rather, are
designed to provide an output equal to the maximum
theoretical output less an amount due to the worst case
fuel injector variability.One approach for solving these problems in unit
injectors is the so-called select fit manufacturing
process. Generally, a common procedure involves flowing
fluid through each unit injector nozzle and pumping
mechanism and categorizing each nozzle and pumping
mechanism accordingly. During assembly, each nozzle is
matched with pumping mechanisms known to be compatible,
depending on the category under which the nozzle is 
categorized. The disadvantage associated with this
approach is the relatively high cost involved with sorting
the nozzles and pumping mechanisms and maintaining these
groupings for the duration of the manufacturing and
assembly process.Another approach for solving these problems involves
extremely rigid manufacturing procedures for achieving the
high manufacturing precision necessary to meet the desired
design specification. Such high manufacturing precision
has the disadvantage of increasing the manufacturing costs,
including the costs involved in manufacturing precision
components and subassemblies and the cost related to the
subsequent assembly process. Further, neither of the above
mentioned manufacturing-oriented solutions satisfactorily
controls rejection of completely assembled injectors that
fail to fall within the timing and delivery tolerances of
the design specification. Thus, excess scrap remains a
problem with these manufacturing-oriented approaches.With the advent of increasingly sophisticated
ele
