<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are server features for allowing a client user to defer completion of multi-step user transaction applications ("MUTAs") and later resume the MUTA. One disclosed feature is providing a selectable deferral action in a page implementing part of the MUTA, e.g., HTML, XML, JavaScript/ECMA Script document. If the client user selects to defer completion, a state object is created by the server and stores state information including information previously entered during the MUTA. The server provides a resumption object to the user including a resource for resuming the deferred MUTA. When the user selects the resource, state information stored in the state object is loaded and the use may complete the remainder of the MUTA. An additionally disclosed aspect is automatic state saving where state information is stored automatically during multiple steps in the MUTA; the user then need not select deferral.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD, APPARATUS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR DEFERRED COMPLETION OF MULTI-STEP USER TRANSACTIONAPPLICATIONSFIELDAspects of the invention relate generally to server architectures for transaction processing and more particularly to architectures with features allowing user control over the timing of the completion portion of transaction processing.BACKGROUNDThe collection of protocols and applications commonly referred to as the World Wide Web ("Web") is a widely used client-server architecture for transaction applications. The convenience of carrying on transactions with Web applications is leading to an increasing portion of the transactions persons engage in day-to-day being performed with Web applications.Typically, transaction applications involve many steps each with its own page. The network user generally must interact must with each page of the transaction application. When such a multi-step user transaction application (hereinafter "MUTA") is started by the user, they may not have expected the MUTA to require as many steps as it does, or some other activity may interrupt the user's ability to complete the MUTA at the current time. This is particularly true with increasingly popular platforms where, for instance, Web applications, are combined with televised entertainment. Such platforms are frequently known as "Enhanced TV" or "Interactive TV" (hereinafter "ITV"). In such a context, a viewer of a video program may be prompted by a Web resource enhancing the video program to initiate a transaction. However, the user may wish to return to viewing the video program quickly and not wish to spend the time to complete the transaction at that moment. 

Thus it would be desirable for a mechanism to exist that allowed the user to defer completion of such a transaction.Related series of technologies include user registration systems. In a typical user registration system, a user provides information to the operator of, for instance, a Web application. The user may be able to pre-specify information that is relevant to a later interaction during the registration process. However, the registration information that is stored cannot provide information that would allow a user to return to the precise position in a later-initiated transaction where the user decided to defer completion. Put another way, while user data stored, for instance as part of a registration process, may be relevant to a later transaction and form part of the state of the transaction at any particular step, user registration data
