<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes and illustrates devices, to be used in the healthcare sector, for mounting tubes and electric cables (10) which comprise a mounting member (11) for tubes or cables, a coupling member (12) rotatably connected thereto, and a fastening member (13) which is in turn connected thereto so as to be multiply pivotable. Such mounting devices are simple to produce, extremely practical to use and they guarantee absolutely safe laying and positionally stable mounting of sensitive lines, such as, in particular, blood lines, secretion lines and infusion lines.

<CLAIMS>
Device for fixing lines such as tubes, electrical 
cables and the like to medical equipment and to facilities 

used in the nursing of the sick and the elderly, such as beds, 
bedsteads, patients' clothing, or the like, characterized by a 

line retaining part (11) which holds the line (10), relieved 
of strain, a coupling piece (12) which is joined to the line 

retaining part so as to be capable of rotating freely around 
an axis (A) running perpendicular to the line holder (15) of 

the line retaining part (11), but in an axially fixed manner, 
and by a fastening part (13) which is provided with a wire-type 

section (14) which is accommodated in a lug-type holder 
(23) of the coupling piece so as to be capable both of moving 

freely to and fro along a main length (double arrow 25) and of 
swivelling freely around the direction of its main length. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the joint between the line retaining part (11) and the 

coupling piece (12) is formed as an axially inserted locking 
peg joint (17, 18; 19), particularly one which is not 

separable without a tool. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by a 

direction of insertion of the locking joint (17; 19) which is 
transversal relative to the rotational axis (A). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the holder (15) of the line retaining part (11) and/or the 

holder (23) of the coupling piece (12) are formed as laterally 
open lugs [enclosing]
, respectively, the circumferential 
surface of the line (10) and the wire-type section (14) of the 

fastening part (13), into which the line (10) and the wire 
type section (14) respectively are clipped transversely 

relative to the main length (16 or 25) of the line/section.  
 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the lug main section of the holder (15) encloses the line (10) 

by more than 180Â°. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the lug-type holder (15) includes a releasable locking 

element within which the line (10) is secured, in the form of 
spring tongue (33), formed on the line retaining part (11), 

which obstructs the lug slot (34). 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the line retaining part (11) has several 

holders (15) arranged above and/or adjacently to one another. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the line retaining part (11) and/or the coupling piece (12) is 

a plastics injection moulded part. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening part (13) is a clamp, cramp or clip (31), 

particularly one in the style of a trouser braces' clip. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening part (13) is a magnet. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening part (13) is a suction pad (26). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening part (13) is an adhesive disc. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening part (13) is loop, coil, hook, or the like, made 

from wire (29) .
