<DESCRIPTION>
The instant application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to United States
provisional application Serial No. 60/107,798, filed on November 10, 1998.The present invention relates generally to methods and formulations for the separation of
biological macromolecules, and in particular, to the separation to single-stranded DNA fragments
according to their size using capillary electrophoresis with improved polyacrylamide matrixes.Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has demonstrated its advantages over standard slab gel
based electrophoretic techniques as a rapid, high-throughput and high-resolution method for
separation of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, peptides and nucleic acids (see e.g.
Slater et al., Electrophoresis, 1998. 19(10), 1525-1541.) Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) is
the CE-analog of traditional slab-gel electrophoresis and is most often used for size-based
separation of biological macromolecules such as oligonucleotides, DNA restriction fragments
and proteins. The separation is performed by filling the capillary with a sieving matrix, for
example, cross-linked polyacrylamide, agarose or linear polymer solutions. The main advantages
over slab-gel electrophoresis are a wider range of gel matrice and compositions, on-line.
detection, improved quantitation and automation.One of the major technological improvements in CE for DNA analysis was the
introduction of replaceable polymer solutions as sieving matrices (see, e.g., Sudor et al.
Electrophoresis, 1991. 12:1056-1058; Ruiz-Martinez et al., Analytical Chemistry, 1993.
65(20):2851-2858.) The use of solutions of non-cross-linked synthetic or natural polymers has
significantly increased the number of analyses per capillary column. Replacing the matrices after
each separation run creates reproducible analytical conditions. Another advantage of non
cross-linked polymers is that they can be polymerized under controlled conditions in aqueous
solutions, characterized, purified and stored indefinitely as dry powder (see, e.g., Goetzinger et
al., Electrophoresis, 1998. 19(2):242-248.) Solutions of polymers may then be prepared using various background electrolyte
systems according to the requirements of a particular application. The versatility gained by the
use of such entangled polymer solutions allows for a wide range of electraphoresis conditions to
be utilized, such as elevated capillary temperature, without damaging the matrix structure (see,
e.g., Kleparnik et al., Electrophoresis, 1996. 17(12):1860-1866). In contrast
