<ABSTRACT>
A process for the synthesis of a smectite type mineral such as hectorite comprising the formation of a solid reaction product containing the magnesium and silicon values of the hectorite by the precipitation of at least a proportion of the said values under basic conditions to form a precursor and the subsequent treatment of the said precursor under hydrothermal conditions to achieve crystallisation of a product having a hectorite structure and the separation and washing of that product, the process being characterised in that the pH under which the precipitation is conducted is controlled at from 7.5 to 9 or from 9.7 to 10 to improve processing or performance characteristics for example, the washing time, the rate of dispersion, the clarity dispersion, the time to gel or the gel strength. The product is suitable for a wide variety of applications as a rheological additive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of
hectorite and more particularly to a
method of controlling the synthesis to achieve particular
product and processing characteristics.Hectorite is a clay mineral which occurs naturally at
several locations in the United States notably at Hector,
California. Hectorite is a layered swelling trioctahedral
magnesium silicate mineral which has a smectite type
structure and having the general formula
[Mg6-xLixSi8O20OH4-yFy]x-
in which x may have a value of from 0 to 1.2, y may have a
value of from 0 to less than 4 and the overall negative
lattice charge is balanced by cations. The composition and
the rheological and other physical properties of this
naturally occuring mineral may be somewhat variable and to
avoid this, and to produce a material having relatively
improved rheological properties, processes for the synthesis
of hectorite-type materials have been developed. Other
smectites such as saponite and montmorillonite have also
been synthesised. The structures of smectites and of the
individual smectite-type minerals identified above may be
readily identified by X-ray diffraction techniques.Very many of the hectorite syntheses have in common the
precipitation of silica under basic conditions. Neumann,
for example, in United States Patents No. 3586478 and
3671190 teaches the co-precipitation of magnesium and
silicon values corresponding to the hectorite composition
from a solution of a water soluble magnesium salt such as 
magnesium sulphate or magnesium chloride, sodium silicate, a
base such as sodium carbonate or hydroxide and, if
appropriate, lithium and fluorine compounds and the
treatment of the precipitate under hydrothermal and
preferably elevated pressure conditions to achieve
crystallisation with the formation of a hectorite structure.
Neumann later disclosed in United States Patent No 4049780 a
variation in the process comprising precipitating silicon
values onto a preformed suspension of a water-insoluble
magnesium compound. Further development of hectorite
syntheses involved variation of the materials used. The use
of partially or wholly degraded natural materials as a
source of a proportion of the magnesium and/or silicon
values was disclosed in, for example, United States patent
No. 3954943. United States Patent No. 4054537 disclosed the
inclusion of silica in sol form and Japanese Patent
Publication No. 61-12848 disclosed its inclusion in the form
of silicic acid. German Patent No. 3934473 disclosed the
use of sodium bicarbonate as the base used to

A process for the synthesis of hectorite comprising
the formation of a solid reaction product containing the

magnesium and silicon values of the hectorite by the
precipitation of at least a proportion of the said values

under basic conditions to form a precursor and the subsequent
treatment of the said precursor under hydrothermal conditions

to achieve crystallisation of a product having the hectorite
structure, characterized in that the pH under which

precipitation is conducted, or the pH of the precursor before
pressure hydrothermal treatment, is controlled at from 7.5 +

0.25 to 10, but excluding 9.0 to 9.75.
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in
that the pH is controlled at from 7.5 ± 0.25 to 8.75.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that said process is a multibatch process. 
A process for the synthesis of hectorite comprising
the formation of a solid reaction product containing the

magnesium and silicon values of the hectorite by the
precipitation of at least a proportion of the said values

under basic conditions to form a precursor and the

hydrothermal conditions to achieve crystallisation of a
product having the hectorite structure, characterized in

that the pH under which precipitation is conducted, or the
pH of the precursor before pressure hydrothermal

the process pH is controlled by the addition of a suitable

reagent to the reaction mixture before hydrothermal
treatment thereof.
A process as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the pH
adjusted reaction mixture is subjected to an atmospheric

pressure hydrothermal treatment at at least 60°C and for
at least 0.5 hours, and is subjected thereafter to a

hydrothermal pressure treatment.
A process as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein
the pH is adjusted by the addition of sulphuric acid or

nitric acid.
A process as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein
the pH is adjusted by the addition of a reagent having a

concentration of from 5% w/w to 50% w/w.
