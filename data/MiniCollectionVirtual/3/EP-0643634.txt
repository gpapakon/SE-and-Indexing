 ENDMILL ADAPTER WITH INTEGRAL COLLETFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a tool holder for holding a cutting tool, such as an endmill, and more particularly to an endmill adapter having an integral collet, for receiving an endmill or similar tool.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An endmill is a generally cylindrical cutting tool which has a plurality of cutting edges around its outer periphery. The endmill usually includes a cylindrical shank which fits into an axial bore of a tool holder. Various designs have been suggested for securing the endmill in the tool holder against axial movement and against rotation of the endmill with respect to the holder.One method of securing the endmill within the holder is to use a set screw threadably engaged in the wall of the holder which can be tightened against a flat formed on the shank of the endmill. The use of a radial set screw, however, has some disadvantages. Most significantly, the radial set screw tends to push the endmill off center within the holder thereby effecting the accuracy of the endmill. Another method which has been used is to employ a collet and chuck. A tapered collet having an axial bore for receiving the tool is pressed into a tapered bore in the tool holder by a lock nut. The 

collet is compressed into engagement with the tool. In theory, the collet collapses uniformly around its circumference so that the tool is accurately positioned at the center of the holder. A non-pullout wedge may be used in conjunction with the collet to prevent axial and rotational movement of the endmill. A collet arrangement of this type is disclosed in the patent to Staron, U. S. Patent No. 4,341,006.While widely used, the standard collet chuck has several drawbacks. First, the interfacing surfaces of the collet and chuck body must be accurately machined which increases the cost of producing the holder. Further, the cumulative tolerances between parts limit the degree of accuracy which can be obtained.SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an endmill adapter having an integral collet which is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and provides a relatively high degree of accuracy. The tool holder includes a shank for mounting the holder into the spindle of a machine. A closed-end collet is integrally formed with the shank and includes an axial bore for receiving the endmill or similar tool. The collet includes a plurality of resilient collet segments for gripping the tool separated by a plurality of axially

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A tool holder for receiving and holding a tool comprising:
(a) a shank for mounting the holder onto a machine;
(b) closed-end collet integrally formed with the shank, said collet including an axial bore for receiving a tool and a plurality of resilient collet segments for gripping the tool separated by a plurality of axially extending slots, said collet further including a continuous tie ring extending around an outer end portion of the collet and joining said plurality of collet segments together; and
(c) means for collapsing the collet segments radially inward to grip the tool inserted into the axial bore.
2. The tool holder of claim 1 further including a wedge aperture formed in the collet assembly, and a locking wedge insertable into the wedge aperture for engaging the endmill to secure the endmill against axial and rotational movement with respect to the tool holder.
3. The tool holder of claim 2 further including a groove extending circumferentially around the collet and intersecting the wedge aperture, and a resilient ring fitted into the groove in the collet for retaining the wedge in the wedge aperture. 


 4. The tool holder of claim 1 wherein the collet is tapered.
5. The tool holder of claim 4 wherein the means for collapsing the collet segments includes a lock nut tapered to match the collet.
6. The tool holder of claim 5 wherein the collet includes an externally threaded section and wherein the lock nut includes an internally threaded section to threadably engage with the externally threaded section of the collet.
7. An endmill adapter for holding an endmill, comprising:
(a) a shank for fitting into the spindle of an endmill; (b) a closed end collet assembly integral with the shank and projecting from the outer end thereof;
(c) the collet assembly including a threaded base formed adjacent the shank and a collet section extending from the threaded base and having a plurality of circumferentially spaced, elongated collet segments separated by spaced apart, elongated slots;
(d) the collet section including a continuous and uninterrupted closed outer terminal ring that joins the collet segments and extends across the ends of the slots separating the collet segments; and
(e) a lock nut adapted to fit over the collet section and to threadably engage the base such that turning the lock nut downwardly onto the threaded base results in the collect section being collapsed and tightened around an endmill disposed within the collet section.
8. A tool holder having an integral collet assembly comprising: (a) a shank portion and a collet assembly integral with the shank portion; 


 (b) the collet assembly including a series of circumferentially spaced elongated collet segments and a series of open slots formed between the respective collect segments, and a base interposed between the shank portion of the tool holder and the collet section;
(c) attaching means formed on the base;
(d) the collet assembly further including a continuous, uninterrupted, closed outer terminal ring joined with the collet segment and extending across the ends of the open slot to form a solid annular end terminal ring on the end of the collet section opposite the base; and
(e) collet closure means for fitting over the collet section and connecting with the attaching means of the base for collapsing and tightening the collet section down onto a tool held within the collet section.
