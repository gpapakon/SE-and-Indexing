<ABSTRACT>
A cutting wheel assembly has a rotatable element (15) having a plurality of rollers (19) which are arranged to run around the outer surface of a support plate (27). A cut-out portion (33) is formed in the support plate, in which portion a drive pinion (34) is located, to mesh with the rollers (19) on the radially inner side thereof. Drive is imparted to the element (15) through the rollers (19), which also serve to mount the element (15) in a rotatable manner. Replaceable cutters are mounted around the outer periphery of the element (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a trench cutting 
assembly. Machines which use a rotating wheel fitted with 
cutters to cut trenches are well known. One kind of 
such trenching machine employs a wheel which is mounted 
on and driven by an axial shaft. This allows the wheel 
to be relatively thin and so to cut a narrow trench, 
required say for installing cables or pipes under roads 
or for some types of land drainage. A drawback of this 
type of wheel is that the drive shaft and its 
associated drive mechanism have to be above the trench 
top, which restricts the depth to which the wheel can 
cut to under half the wheel diameter, and frequently to 
only one third of that diameter. There is another known type of trenching machine 
which has a wheel provided with an eccentric drive, 
where a drive pinion engages external drive teeth near 
the upper periphery of the wheel. The wheel is 
rotatably supported on a frame that is narrower than 
the trench to be excavated so that both the wheel and 
the frame can be lowered into the trench as it is cut. 
With this type of wheel trenches can be excavated to a 
depth of well over half the diameter of the wheel and 
typically to two thirds thereof, often allowing a wheel 
of half the diameter to do the same work as a 
centrally-driven wheel. The advantage of using a smaller diameter wheel is 
most important, as for any given depth of trench a much 
smaller machine may be used. It is also possible to 
dig deeper trenches than otherwise when the wheel is 
used as an attachment on plant such as a skid steer 
loader or a backhoe excavator. Eccentrically driven wheels as described above are 
necessarily more complex than those centrally driven  
 
and the frame with the bearings needed to support the 
wheel and the drive teeth needed to drive it are 
usually relatively wide, so needing a wider trench to 
accommodate them. The disadvantage of the extra trench 
width is not only that more power is needed to drive 
the wheel but that handling the extra excavated 
material, as well as providing, carting, infilling and 
compacting a different backfilling material and 
reinstating the greater surface area all substantially 
increase the costs of the overall trenching operation. A principal aim of this invention is to provide a 
robust arrangement for rotatably supporting and driving 
a cutting wheel which can be made relatively narrow, 
whilst maintaining the advantage of depth capacity 
given by an eccentric drive. According to the present invention there is 
provided a trench

<CLAIMS>
A trench cutting assembly comprising a rotatable 
element (15) adapted to carry a plurality of external 

cutters (22) and having a plurality of rollers (19) 
mounted internally of any carried cutters which rollers 

are spaced around a common pitch circle, a support (27) 
provided with an arcuate support surface on which said 

rollers (19) of the rotatable element (15) engage so as 
radially to support the rotatable element for rotation 

about the axis of said pitch circle, said trench 
cutting assembly further comprising at least one drive 

pinion (34) rotatably mounted on said support (27) so 
that said drive pinion (34) drivingly meshes with said 

rollers (19) to effect rotation of the rotatable 
element (15), and drive means (35,36) to rotate the 

drive pinion. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the support surface is of a discontinuous 

circular form, said drive pinion (34) being mounted 
within the discontinuity (33) in the support surface so 

that the pinion axis lies within the pitch circle of 
the rollers (19) and the pinion internally meshes 

therewith. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in Claim 1 
or Claim 2, wherein more than one drive pinion (34) is 

provided, each such pinion being meshed with said 
rollers (19) to impart drive thereto. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in Claim 2, 
wherein at least two drive pinions (34A,34B) are 

provided, arranged side by side within the 
discontinuity (33) in the support surface so that the 

axes of both drive pinions lie within the pitch circle 
of the rollers (19) and each internally meshes with the 

rollers. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of  
 

the preceding Claims, wherein the drive means includes 
an hydraulic motor (36), for the or each drive pinion 

(34). 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of 
the preceding Claims, wherein the support includes a 

support member (27) defining said arcuate support 
surface and co-operating axial thrust faces (16,28) are 

provided on the rotatable element and the support 
member, to hold the rotatable element against axial 

movement with respect to the support. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of 
the preceding Claims, wherein the rollers (19) and the 

support surface (27) are located wholly within the 
axial width of the rotatable element (15). 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in Claim 5, 
wherein the rotatable element is in the form of a wheel 

(15) arranged to carry cutters (22) on the external 
periphery thereof, the rollers (19) and the support 

surface being disposed internally of the wheel 
periphery. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of 
the preceding Claims, wherein the support (27) includes 

means (11,31) to mount the support on the arm (12,13) 
of an excavator or the like, which mounting means is 

disposed in the vicinity of the drive pinion (34), 
wholly to one side of a diameter of said pitch circle. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of 
the preceding Claims, wherein seal means (25) are 

provided to isolate the rollers (19) and support 
surface (27) from the external environmen
t. 
A trench cutting assembly as claimed in any of 
the preceding Claims, wherein a replaceable wear-ring
