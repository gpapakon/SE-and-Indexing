<ABSTRACT>
A tool (10) for detaching a trailing end portion (26) 
of a filmstrip from at least one hook atop a ramp (46) on a 

film spool (40) inside a film cartridge. This detachment 
occurs when the tool (10) is inserted inwardly through a 

film ingress/egress slot (35) in the cartridge. The tool (10) 
includes a flexible element having a leading first 

portion (12) followed by a wider second portion (14) each 
configured to be successively inserted inwardly through 

the slot of the cartridge (36) beneath a film section in the 
slot such that when the wider second portion (14) is forced 

to slide up the ramp (40) on the spool the leading first 
portion will push the trailing end portion (26) of the 

filmstrip off the hook atop the ramp (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field
of photography, and more particularly to a tool for
detaching a trailing end portion of a filmstrip from
two hooks each atop a ramp on a film spool inside a
film cartridge.In conventional photographic film cartridges,
a photographic filmstrip is wound on a spool within the
cartridge. A trailing end portion of the filmstrip is
secured to the spool. When it is time to process and
print the images captured on the filmstrip, the
filmstrip is permanently detached from its associated
film cartridge. Typically, this detachment has been
accomplished by tearing or cutting the image bearing
portion of the filmstrip from the trailing end portion
of the filmstrip. The main body of the filmstrip is
processed and printed while the film cartridge, spool
and filmstrip trailing end portion are discarded or
recycled.U.S. Patent 4,685,209 is directed to a film
picker for removing a film from a film cartridge, which
includes a pair of flexible plates that are used to
capture the leading end of the film.It is desirable to be able to reattach the
filmstrip to the spool and rewind the filmstrip into
the film cartridge. As such, the film is protected,
for example, during transport from processing to
printing or during storage by the customer. When the
filmstrip is cut or torn from the spool, the trailing
end of the filmstrip, having a specific geometry which 
enables it to be attached to the spool, is damaged or
lost. Consequently, the filmstrip cannot be reattached
to the spool and rewound into the film cartridge.According to one aspect of the invention, a
tool is provided for detaching a trailing end portion
of a filmstrip from a pair of spaced hooks atop a ramp
on a film spool inside a film cartridge. The spool
includes a retention lug positioned between the pair of
hooks which pushes the middle section of the filmstrip
in a downward direction. This detachment occurs when
the tool is inserted inwardly through a film
ingress/egress slot in the cartridge. The tool
includes a flexible element having a leading first
portion followed by a wider second portion associated
with each hook. Each leading first portion is
configured to be successively inserted inwardly through
the slot of the cartridge beneath a film section in the
slot such that when the wider second portion is forced
to slide up the ramp on the spool the leading first
portion will push the trailing end portion of the
filmstrip off the hook atop the ramp.FIGURE. 1 is a schematic representation of a

A tool (10) for detaching a trailing end
portion (26) of a filmstrip (34) from a pair of spaced

hooks (42), each atop a respective ramp (46) on a film
spool (40) inside a film cartridge (36), when said tool

(10) is inserted inwardly through a film ingress/egress
slot (35) in the cartridge (36), said spool (40)

including a retention lug (44) positioned between said
pair of hooks (42), which pushes a middle section of

the filmstrip (34) in a downward direction, said tool
comprising:


a flexible element having a leading first portion
(12) followed by a wider second portion (14) associated

with each of said spaced hooks (42), said leading first
portion (12) and second wider portion (14) being

configured to be successively inserted inwardly through
the slot (35) of the cartridge (36) beneath a film

section in the slot such that when the wider second
portion (14) is forced to slide up the ramp (46) on the

spool (40) the leading first portion (12) will push the
trailing end portion (26) of the filmstrip (34) off the

hook (42) atop the ramp (46).
The tool of claim 1, wherein said
flexible element includes a third portion (16)

extending from said second portions (14), said third
portion (16) having an aperture (20) running lengthwise

along said third portion (16), said aperture (20) being
engageable by a pin (21) such that when said pin (21)

is moved against one end of said aperture (20), said
first portions (12) and second portions (14) are inserted

inwardly through said film ingress/egress slot (35) in
the cartridge (36), when said pin (21) is moved to a

position between said one end of said aperture (20) and
an opposite end of said aperture (20), said first

portions (12) and second portions (14) can be withdrawn 
from said spool (40) by moving said trailing end

portion (26) of said filmstrip (34) out of said spool
(40), and when said pin (21) is moved against said

opposite end of said aperture (20), said first portions
(12) and second portions (16) are withdrawn from said

film ingress/egress slot (35).
The tool of claim 2, wherein said second
portions (14) are tapered from said third portion (16) to

said first portions (12), thereby allowing said second
portions (14) to more easily slide up said ramps (46).
The tool of claim 2, wherein said third
portion (16) defines a slot (18) extending from ends

of said second portions (14) into said third portion
(16), said slot (18) allowing said trailing end portion

(26) of said filmstrip (34) to deform around a
retention lug (44) on said spool (40) when said

trailing end portion of the filmstrip is pushed off
said hooks (42).
The tool of claim 2, wherein said third
portion (20) has a slit (22) extending from ends of

said second portions (14) into said third portion (16),
said slit (22) allowing said trailing end portion (26)

of said filmstrip (34) to deform around a retention lug
(44) on said spool (40) when said trailing end portion

(26) of the filmstrip (34) is pushed off said hooks
(42).
The tool of claim 1, wherein ends of
said first portions (12) away from said second portions

(14) are rounded such that said first portions (12) can
be inserted into said film ingress/egress slot (3)

without becoming jammed. 
A method of detaching a trailing end
portion of a filmstrip (26) from a pair of spaced hooks

(42), each atop a ramp (46) on a
film spool (40) inside a film cartridge (36), said

spool (40) including a retention lug (44) positioned
between said pair of hooks (42), which pushes a middle

section of the filmstrip (34) in a downward direction,
said method comprising the steps of:


providing a tool (10) which includes a flexible
element having a leading first portion (12) followed by

a wider second portion (14) associated with each of said spaced hooks (42);
inserting said tool (10) into an ingress/egress
slot (35) of said film cartridge (36) beneath a film

section in the slot such that the wider second portion
(14) associated with each of said spaced hooks (42)

is forced to slide up the respective ramp
(46) on the spool (40) and the leading first portion

(12) pushes the trailing end portion (26) of the
filmstrip (34) off the hook (42) atop the ramp (46);

and
removing said trailing end portion (26) of said
filmstrip (34) from said film cartridge (36).
The method of claim 7, further
comprising the step of:


imparting slack into said trailing end portion
(26) of said filmstrip (34) inside said film cartridge

(36) prior to pushing said filmstrip trailing end
portion (26) off said hooks (42) thereby facilitating

the removal of said filmstrip trailing end portion (26)
from said hooks (42).
The method of claim 7, wherein said
removing step causes said first portions (12) and second

portions (14) to be removed from said spool (40) thereby 
allowing said filmstrip trailing end portion (26) to be

removed from said spool (40) with minimal interference
from said first portions (12), said second portions (14)

and said hooks (42).
