<ABSTRACT>
A guiding flue (10) of refractory material is arranged at the exit of the slag exhaust hole (7) of a plasma fusion 
furnace (1) to guiding exhaust gas (5) in the downstream direction of the flowing slag. The slag which flows down 

by the sensible heat of the high-temperature exhaust gas, and the vicinity of the exit of the exhaust hole are forcedly 
heated to make it possible to prevent block of the exhaust hole in the vicinity of the exit due to solidified slag. By 

tilting a plasma torch (2) toward the exhaust hole (7) when the exhaust hole begins to be clogged, it is possible to 
prevent the block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating a plasma
furnace according to the preamble of claim 1.In such a plasma furnace
waste such as municipal refuse, shredded and compressed
jalopies, sludge or the incineration residue of these kinds of
waste is melted by a plasma arc struck from a plasma torch and
converted into slag.In particular the invention concerns itself with the art of
melting the slag efficiently, allowing it to be discharged from
the furnace at a constant rate, and keeping waste gas as clean
as possible.In recent years, environmental conservation and the
recycling of resources are becoming the objects of public
attention. Especially, municipal refuse and industrial waste
are showing a yearly increase in quantity to such an extent
that, within and outside large cities, it is becoming difficult
to find out a new site to be filled up with these kinds of
waste in a raw state. Therefore, it is common to incinerate
these kinds of waste and reduce the volume thereof before
taking them to a site to be filled up therewith.However, there are many cases where municipal refuse and 
industrial waste contain metals and various kinds of harmful
matter, which remain in the ashes and incombustibles
(hereinafter called the "incineration residue") after
incineration. Underground water will be polluted if a site is
filled up with such incineration residue. Another trouble is
that, since incineration residue has low specific gravity, an
open pit to be filled up therewith must have a large capacity.
Furthermore, soft ground results from incineration residue with
which a site is filled up, and this soft ground hardly has
utility value.A previously proposed arrangement for eliminating these
various difficulties is characterized in melting the
incineration residue by a plasma arc and then cool it for
solidification. Heavy metals such as chromium are sealed in the
solidified slag and prevented from penetration therethrough
outwardly thereof. Therefore, underground water is not
polluted when a site is filled up with such slag. It will not
only turn out to be a contribution to the recycling of resources
to use this slag as aggregate to be mixed with concrete or as
material for roadbed, but also relieve those skilled in the art
of their anxiety about finding out a new site to be filled up
with this slag.For example,
JP-A-3-55411 describes a plasma furnace for melting the incineration
residue by a plasma arc. This plasma furnace includes a furnace
body having a chamber for allowing molten slag to stay. The
