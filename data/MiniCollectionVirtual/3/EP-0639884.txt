<ABSTRACT>
A central support (1) which is designed as a stamped part or metallised plastic part is used for the mutual electrical and mechanical connection of the other apparatus parts. The support is extrusion coated with a plastic and injection-moulded part (10) which, for its part, holds the support (1) (which is split into electrically insulated conductor parts after being extrusion coated) together and forms housing walls (10b, 10c) as well as a plug sheath (10a). The production is particularly economical, and thus cost-effective.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing an electrical drive unit with an electric
motor and a control unit joined with it, with these steps:


a solid metal carrier (1) is manufactured as a pressed part, which
includes both connections (2, 12) configured as plug contacts and

electrical connections for interconnecting electrical components (3 to
5),
the metal carrier (1) is partly sprayed with plastics material (10) and
assembled with at least two electrical components (3 to 5), of which

one is configured as a microprocessor (3),
excess parts (8) or connections of the pressed part are removed to
form individual conductor tracks, electrically separated from each other,

or plug contacts and
the casing parts (14, 15) are attached.
A method according to Claim 1,

characterised in that,

in the spraying with plastics material (10) at least one cavity (10d) is
formed for an encapsulating mass (11), which is poured in after the

assembly of the components.
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in that parts
(6) of the carrier (1) outstanding from the sprayed plastics material part

are left as a cooling element (6).
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the cooling
elements are 
bent round.
