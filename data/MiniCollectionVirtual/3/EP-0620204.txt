<ABSTRACT>
The moisturizing and nutrient agent of high viscosity 
is constituted basically by water, a hydrated 

metallic salt, cellulosic compound and concentrated 
dressing. This agent can release water and nutrient 

substances when interacting with biological organisms 
contained in soil surrounding a plant or in 

water for hydrophonics. Also a method is described 
for producing a moisturizing and nutrient agent capable 

to provide a vegetal organism with water, air 
and concentrated dressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technical field 
concerning methods, instruments and products used 
for plants irrigation, protection and dressing. The present invention concerns a new method for producing 
a moisturizing agent to which plant protection 
products and/or dressing can be added, this 
agent being used to moisture soil surrounding plants 
rooted either directly in the ground or in a flower-pot. It is often difficult to maintain constant moisture 
of soil surrounding the plant either during various 
phases of plant growth or during changeable ambient 
conditions. In fact, the degree of soil moisture at 
the level of the plant roots is vital for the same 
plant, specially during highly evaporative condition. Up to now, the moisture has been typically added to 
the soil by watering using manual or automatic means 
such as sprinkler systems. A further method, used so far, for maintaining the 
ground moisture, utilizes the sponge like materials 
which are previously mixed with the soil surrounding 
the plant roots and then imbued with water during 
the sprinkling watering either natural or artificial.  Then, due to evaporation, such sponge like materials 
gradually release water contained therein to the 
plant soil. The soil prepared in that way is subject 
to evaporation and requires frequent watering in 
adverse condition. Therefore, the disadvantage of such methods lies in 
the necessity of many additions of water during 
highly evaporative conditions e.g. hot weather, high 
winds, and the like. A further disadvantage lies in the fact that such 
watering methods require the presence, also occasional, 
of a watering operator or an automatic watering 
system, extremely expensive. The main object of the present invention is to propose 
a method that uses a moisturizing and nutrient 
agent capable to moisturize and nourish automatically, 
by gradual release of water, gas and dressing, 
the soil surrounding the plant roots either in a 
flower pot or in the ground, or able to release gradually 
the nutrient substances to the hydrophonics 
water. A further object of the present invention is to propose 
a method employing a moisturizing agent that is 
not subject to excessive evaporation and that maintains 
unchanged its physical-chemical properties 
also in high temperatures and that does not return 
to the liquid state in normal environmental conditions.  Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a moisturizing agent that is not toxic in any way 
and that does not leave waste at the
