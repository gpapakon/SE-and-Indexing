<ABSTRACT>
A manipulating tool on a shovel with a bucket, in particular a dipper shovel, and with a hydraulic grab plate associated with the bucket is designed to increase the mobility of the bucket and at the same time make it possible to open and close the grabbing tool individually. This is accomplished by attaching to the grab plate (17) a pivoting carrier frame (5) in which the bucket (11) is articulated, the pivoting support frame (5) itself being articulated on the bucket arm (3) of the shovel (1) and operatively connected to the bucket cylinder (().

<CLAIMS>
Digger (1) having a shovel (11) and a hydraulically
operated grab plate (17) associated with the shovel,

wherein a carrier swivel frame (5) is provided on the
grab plate and the carrier swivel frame (5) is

disposed in a hinged manner on the shovel stem (3) of
the digger and in an active manner on an operating

cylinder (4), wherein the shovel (11) is designed as a
hoe-type bucket and the grab plate (17) itself is of a

bucket-like design,

characterized in

that the shovel (11) is supported in a hinged
manner on the grab plate (17) and movable into an

open or closed position relative to the grab
plate by means of at least one piston/cylinder

unit (14) disposed on the carrier swivel
frame (5) and
that the shovel (11) at the top back outside edge
region is provided with at least one slewing

boom (12), which at its free ends is acted upon
by the hydraulic piston/cylinder unit (14),

wherein the other end of the piston/cylinder unit
is coupled to the bottom edge region (15) of the

grab plate (17) or of the carrier swivel
frame (5).
Digger (1) having a shovel (11) and a hydraulically
operated grab plate (17) associated with the shovel,

wherein a carrier swivel frame (5) is provided on the
grab plate and the carrier swivel frame (5) is

disposed in a hinged manner on the shovel stem (3) of
the digger and in an active manner on an operating

cylinder (4), wherein the shovel (11) is designed as a
hoe-type bucket and the grab plate (17) itself is of a

bucket-like design,

characterized in

that the shovel (11) is supported in a hinged
manner on the grab plate (17) and movable into an 

open or closed position relative to the grab
plate by means of at least one piston/cylinder

unit (14) disposed on the carrier swivel
frame (5) and
that the grab plate (17) at the top back outside
edge region is provided with at least one slewing

boom, which at its free end is acted upon by a
hydraulic piston/cylinder unit, wherein the other

end of the piston/cylinder unit is coupled to the
bottom outside edge region of the shovel (11).
Digger according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in

that the grab plate (17) is provided with two pairs of
back grouser plates (16), which at the top end receive

the swivel fittings (10) and at the bottom end (15)
receive the fastening fittings for the piston/cylinder

unit (14) and a part of the carrier swivel frame (5).
Digger according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in

that it is provided with a rotating and/or slewing
device for rotating or swinging the shovel (11) plus

grab plate (17) in a plane differing from the
swivelling plane of the shovel (11) and grab plate.
