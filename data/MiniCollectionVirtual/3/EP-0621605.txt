<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nuclear fuel elements 
having cladding tubes of zirconium alloys for use in 
power-producing water-cooled, nuclear reactors. The invention 
also extends to nuclear reactors containing such nuclear 
fuel elements. Incidental occurrence of a fuel cladding defect, such 
as fretting type failures, have occurred in light water 
reactors. Such primary failures are sometimes followed by 
secondary failures which frequently cause considerably 
larger activity releases. The causes of the fuel failures in light water reactors 
vary but fretting type failures are predominant, in 
particular those caused by various types of loose objects, 
debris, which accidentally appear in the primary coolant 
system. Irrespective of the causes of the primary failures, 
these are sometimes followed by secondary failures 
which can cause considerably larger activity releases than 
the original primary failure. In such cases the subsequent 
degradation of the defect fuel elements by the formation 
of brittle hydride blisters in the cladding material seems 
to be a common destructive mechanism. The formation of 
such hydrides results in a common type of secondary failures, 
which typically give rise to a steadily increasing 
release of radioactivity to the coolant. On extended operation 
of defect fuel elements the enclosed water or steam 
tends to continuously hydrogenate the cladding material, 
uniformly as well as at local spots, while concurrently 
the fuel pellets oxidize and swell. As a result tensile 
forces build up in the clad wall, which on rare occasions 
act to initiate and gradually propagate long axially extending 
cracks in the cladding. Such brittle crack formation, 
known as "delayed hydrogen cracking", may impose intolerable 
release of radioactivity from the defect fuel 
element. Occasionally, fuel pellets are eroded and fuel 
particles spreading into the primary water coolant system  
 
may persist for years as radioactive sources. The present invention has for a principle object to 
alleviate or at least significantly reduce secondary failures 
due to hydride blister formation or longitudinal 
clad cracking resulting from the occurrence of a fuel 
cladding defect. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
nuclear fuel element wherein the release of radioactivity 
upon a fuel cladding defect is substantially reduced. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a 
nuclear fuel element containing a thermal neutron-absorbing 
material which upon ingress of water through
