<ABSTRACT>
A method of jointing members and a jointing structure capable of 
simplifying the jointing operation and of jointing members firmly without 

exposing jointed portions on jointing surfaces of the members. A 
recessed portion (13) is formed in the jointing surface (11) of one member 

(A) and the bag body (22) made of a flexible material is attached to the 
jointing surface (21) of the other member (B) wherein the jointing surfaces 

(11, 21) of both members (A, B) are brought into contact with each other 
while the bag body (22) is inserted into the recessed portion (13) and a filler 

(C) is introduced and filled into the bag body (22) so as to expand the bag 
body (22) along the inner peripheral shape of the recessed portion (13). 

Tensile strength is generated in the bag body (22) expanded by the fillers 
(C) in the jointing direction, whereby both members (A, B) can be firmly 

jointed with each other while they are fastened to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of jointing members and
a jointing structure adapted for use in jointing body members such as a
concrete block and other various members.In view of enhancing construction efficiency at a construction site,
commercialization of various members in a factory have been recently
promoted in a construction industry. When the members which have
been commercialized in the factory are jointed to each other in the
construction site, the members are usually jointed physically with each
other such as using metal pieces, etc. since stress is applied to the
jointing portions of the members, and hence they are hardly jointed by
adhesive.Such a prior art jointing means using physical jointing method is
strong in the jointing strength but it has a problem in that aesthetic
appearance is not fine because the jointed portions of the members are
exposed on the surface of the jointed members. Furthermore, since metal
pieces are used individually for jointing the members in the manner that
they are engaged with or screwed with each other, which causes the
problem in that jointing operation is troublesome and many operators are
required.In the document GB-A-2 051 916 which has been used to formulate the preamble parts of claims 1 and 5
a system for connecting panels
is disclosed. A connector is provided which fits in respective
openings of the panels to be connected.
It comprises two hollow chambers which are connected by a
flexible neck portion. In order to apply such connector, one
of the hollow chambers has to be deflated, thereby getting
into a shape which allows insertion of the respective side of
the connector into an opening of one of the panels. Insertion
of the connector into the other panel which has to be connected
is performed in a similar manner. In order to have sufficient
space available for inserting the deflated connector
into the opening, there is a U-shaped section provided in
one end of the opening. When the respective hollow chamber,
which is inserted into the opening of the panel, is inflated,
the U-shaped section remains as a hollow space. After inflation
of the chambers it is possible to fill in a hardenable
substance in order to improve stability of the connection.
However, the "bridge" between the connected parts is only
built by the flexible neck portion. In summary, a method is
disclosed that requires two subsequent assembling steps, and
which results in a connection whose stability can only be
improved by introduction of a hardening substance into the
holes

<CLAIMS>
A method of jointing members comprising the steps of:

forming a recessed portion (13) in a jointing surface
(11) of a first member (A);
attaching a bag body (22) made of a flexible material to
a jointing surface (21) of a second member (B);
bringing jointing surfaces (11, 21) of said two members
(A, B) into contact with each other while said bag body (22)

is inserted into said recessed portion (13);
forcing to introduce and fill a filler (C) into said bag
body (22); and
generating an integral connection between said bag body
(22) and said second member (B);

characterized in that

said attaching of said bag body (22) to said jointing
surface (21) of said second member (B) includes embedding an

anchor portion (23) which is integral with said bag body (22)
in the second member (B); and
said forcing to introduce and fill a filler (C) into said
bag body (22) expands said bag body (22) over the whole of the

peripheral surface of said recessed portion (13),

whereby said two members (A, B) are jointed with each other.
A method of jointing members according to claim 1,
characterized in that said bag body (22) is folded before

bringing jointing surfaces (11, 21) of said two members into
contact with each other.
A jointing structure comprising two members (A, B) which
are jointed with each other at jointing surfaces (11, 21) thereof,

said two members (A, B) comprising a first member (A)
having a recessed portion (13) formed in a jointing surface

(11) thereof and a second member (B) having a bag body (22) 
made of a flexible material attached to its jointing surface

(21) wherein said bag body (22) is inserted into said recessed
portion (13) and a filler (C) is forced to be introduced and

filled into said bag body (22),

characterized in that

said bag body (22) comprises an anchor portion (23) embedded
into the second member (B) by which anchor portion (23) the

bag body (22) is integrally attached to said jointing surface
(21) of said second member (B), and said bag body (22) is expanded

by said filler (C) over the whole of the peripheral
surface of said recessed portion (13), whereby said two members

(A, B) are jointed with each other.
