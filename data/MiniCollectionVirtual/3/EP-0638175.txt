<ABSTRACT>
Contemporary infection by Helicobacter pylori in a human or other mammal can be detected by detecting H. pylori-specific IgG antibody in saliva, or other mucous secretion, with an antigen preparation from H. pylori. Diagnosis depends on detection of the antigen-antibody complex. For improved reliability, the antigen preparation comprises H. pylori-derived components of about 265 kDa and about 340 kDa and is substantially free of an H. pylori-derived component of about 440 kDa. The antigen preparation may be immobilised onto a solid support such as a nitrocellulose strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method and
kit which permit the rapid in vitro detection of
Helicobacter pylori infection in mammals. More
particularly, the present invention contemplates a method
for the detection of IgG antibodies against H. pylori in
mucous secretions and thereby provides a means to monitor
contemporary infection by the microbe in mammals.Gut infections in mammals, and in particular humans,
stimulate an immune response in mucous secretions, such
as saliva, through activation of the common mucosal
immune system. This response often initially parallels
an antibody response in serum although is generally
characterised by the presence of IgA antibodies.
However, the immune response in secretion, including
saliva, rapidly diminishes following elimination of the
antigen (eg bacteria or virus) from the body.
Accordingly, the presence of antibody in mucous
secretions reflects current, ie contemporary, infection.
In the case of a microbial infection, for example,
antibodies in mucous secretions, hereinafter referred to
as secretious antibodies, reflect the current status of
colonisation of the microbe, such as in the gut, and thus
is a useful monitor of contemporary infection. Serum
antibody, on the other hand, persists for some time after
the microbe is eliminated from the body. A positive
serum antibody test, therefore, reflects both past and
present exposure to antigen which is less helpful to the
clinician. A positive secretious antibody test, on the
other hand, indicates present or contemporary infection
by the microbe. The present invention arose following an investigation
into Helicobacter pylori (also known as Campylobacter
pylori) infection in the gut of mammals. The diagnosis of
H. pylori infection can be made by microscopy,
microbiological culture or urease detection in gastric
mucosal biopsies, urea breath test or by the presence of
specific antibodies in serum ELISAs. It might be
predicted that H. pylori infection, being an infection of
the gastric mucosa, would elicit an IgA antibody response
in gastric secretion. However during work prior to the
present invention, it was discovered that H. pylori-specific
antibody in mucous secretions is of the IgG
class and not IgA as might have been expected. Little
IgA antibody, if any, is detected. Accordingly, AU-A-9067676
is directed to the detection of IgG in mucous
secretion specific to H. pylori antigen and thereby
provides a means of monitoring current, ie contemporary,
infection by that microorganism in mammals. The
