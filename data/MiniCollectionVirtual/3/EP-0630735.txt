<ABSTRACT>
Fiber reinforced laminates are made by providing a multicomponent 
staple fiber yarn having a fibrous matrix thermoplastic component with a first melting 

point if crystalline or a first softening point if not crystalline, and a drawable fibrous 
reinforcing thermoplastic component with a second melting point if crystalline or a 

second softening point if not crystalline, wherein the first melting point is at least 5° 
below the second melting point; fabricating the yarn into a pre-consolidation fabric; 

shaping the pre-consolidation fabric by conforming the fabric onto a mold or substrate; 
and heating the shaped pre-consolidation fabric to the first melting or softening point 

but not to the second melting or softening point such that the matrix component melts 
and consolidates the reinforcing component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to reinforced composite items and 
processes for making them. More specifically, this invention relates to reinforced 
composite articles made substantially from thermoplastic staple fibers. As used herein, the term "fiber" includes fibers of extreme or 
indefinite length ("filaments") and fibers of short length ("staple fiber"). The term 
"fabric" denotes a two, or possibly three, dimensional product built up from fibers. 
These fibers may occur in the fabric uni-directionally, bi-directionally with different 
warp and woof ratios or tri-directionally. The term "mixed fiber" or "mixed fibers" 
refers to yarns composed of two or more different types of fibers. The term 
"multicomponent fiber" or "multicomponent fibers" refers to fibers having two or 
more longitudinally coextensive components. The term "multicomponent yarn" or 
"multicomponent yarns" refers to either mixed fiber yarns, multicomponent fibers, 
yarns or mixtures of them. The term "multicomponent staple fiber yarn" or 
"multicomponent staple fiber yarns" refers to yarns made at least partially from staple 
fiber.  Fiber reinforced products are known. Such products make possible 
the manufacture of advanced thermoplastic composite parts in very complex shapes. 
The traditional composites take the form of a thermoplastic matrix reinforced by 
non-thermoplastic fibers, such as graphite, glass, ceramics and similar fibers. These 
materials may be found in many "high-tech" applications such as for aircraft 
components and recreational equipment. U.S. Patent No. 4,539,249 ("'249") describes laminates of graphite, 
glass, aramides, ceramics, quartz, boron, SiC, etc., and resinous thermoplastic fibers 
which are intended for conversion into a composite. To make the pre-consolation 
form, resinous thermoplastic fibers are combined or blended with the reinforcing 
fibers to form a single yarn. The blended yarn is then woven into a fabric that is 
shaped to a suitable form in a mold and then heated to melt the thermoplastic 
component. Also described is a process for spinning staple resin fibers with graphite 
to form the yarn which is then woven into the fabric, shaped and heated. Fabrics 
formed by interweaving the graphite in the resin fibers by conventional weaving 
techniques are also disclosed. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,874,563 ("'563"), 4,818,318 ("'318"), and 4,871,491 
("491") describe methods of forming fiber reinforced composites by forming a tape 
or fabric prepreg especially of carbon fiber tows intermixed with
