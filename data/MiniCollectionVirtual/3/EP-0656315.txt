A lift truck having a telescopic arm, of the type including a cab
(4) containing the driver's station and a motor propulsion unit (5), located

to either side of the telescopic arm, a front bridge and a rear bridge and
mechanical transmission means for transmitting the movement of an

internal combustion engine to at least one of the two front or rear
bridges or to both these front and rear bridges, the internal combustion

engine (20, 40) being oriented transversely with respect to the truck,
characterised in that the mechanical transmission means includes a

gearbox (12) with a clutch driven by means of an angled transmission
(30, 50) having at least one output and preferably two outputs, one of

which drives the gearbox (12), in that this gearbox (12) is situated in a
central position and in that the mechanical transmission means (30, 12)

are connected to the output shaft (24, 44) of the internal combustion
engine (20) by means of a Cardan transmission (28).
A truck according to Claim 1, characterised in that the internal
combustion engine (20, 40) is connected to the mechanical transmission

means (30, 12) through a longitudinal member (2a) of the truck chassis
(2), in which longitudinal member (2a) there is provided to this effect an

opening (29), a notch (49), cut-out or similar passage.
A truck according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that another
output from the angled transmission (30, 50) drives an hydraulic pump

(13) supplying energy to the hydraulic actuators of the truck. 
A truck according to Claim 3, characterised in that the input
shaft of the gearbox (12) is substantially coaxial with the drive shaft of

the hydraulic pump (13) supplying the hydraulic devices of the truck (1).
A truck according to Claim 1, characterised in that the angled
transmission (30) is a double output angled transmission of the type

having a through-shaft, at one end of which is mounted the gearbox (12)
and at the other end of which is mounted the hydraulic pump (13) of the

truck (1).
A truck according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the radiator (25, 45) and the fan (26, 46) of the

motor propulsion unit are mounted at the internal combustion engine
(20, 40) side.
A truck according to Claim 6, characterised in that the shaft of
the fan (26) is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the truck

(1).
A truck according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the fan
(26, 46) is driven by an angled transmission (27, 47) controlled by the

timing mechanism of the engine (20, 40).
A lift truck having a telescopic arm, of the type including a cab
(4) containing the driver's station and a motor propulsion unit (5), located

to either side of the telescopic arm, a front bridge and a rear bridge and
mechanical transmission means for transmitting the movement of an

internal combustion engine to at least one of the two front or rear
bridges or to both of these front and rear bridges, the internal 

combustion engine (40) being oriented transversely with respect to the
truck, characterised in that the mechanical transmission means includes a

gearbox (12) with a clutch driven by means of an angled transmission
(50) having at least one output and preferably two outputs, one of which

drives the gearbox (12), in that this gearbox (12) is situated in a central
position and in that the mechanical transmission means (50, 12) are

connected to the output shaft (44) of the internal combustion engine (40)
by means of a part of an elongate connection (48).
A truck according to Claim 9, characterised in that the internal
combustion engine (40) is connected to the mechanical transmission

means (50, 12) through a longitudinal member (2a) of the truck chassis
(2), in which longitudinal member (2a) there is provided to this effect an

opening (29), a notch (49), cut-out or similar passage.
A truck according to Claim 9 or 10, characterised in that
another output from the angled transmission (50) drives an hydraulic

pump (13) supplying energy to the hydraulic actuators of the truck.
A truck according to Claim 11, characterised in that the input
shaft of the gearbox (12) is substantially co-axial with the drive shaft of

the hydraulic pump (13) supplying the hydraulic devices of the truck (1).
A truck according to Claim 9, characterised in that the angled
transmission (50) is a double output angled transmission of the type

having a through-shaft, at one end of which is mounted the gearbox (12)

and at the other end of which is mounted the hydraulic pump (13) of the
truck (1). 
A truck according to any one of Claims 9 to 13, characterised in
that the radiator (45) and the fan (46) of the motor propulsion unit are

mounted at the internal combustion engine (40) side.
A truck according to Claim 6, characterised in that the shaft of
the fan (46) is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the truck

(1).
