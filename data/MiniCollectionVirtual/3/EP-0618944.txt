<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a plain bearing 
material suitable for use e.g. as a bearing bush or as a 
thrust washer. It is possible to use unfilled nylon 6.6 as a plain 
bearing material, e.g. for bearing bushes, but this 
material is not suitable for applications requiring 
operation at high pressures and/or temperatures since the 
wear of the material is unacceptable. The wear resistance 
of the material can be improved by mixing strengtheners 
and/or lubricants with the nylon. For example, one bush 
that is on the market contains approximately 30% by weight 
of glass fibres and approximately 15% by weight of 
polytetrafluoroethylene. Such bushes have an extended 
range of operation when compared to unfilled bushes but 
this range is still considerably more limited than is 
desirable. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
plain bearing material which has an extended range of 
operation in comparison with existing materials. The invention provides a plain bearing material having 
a composition comprising: 
45 to 60 weight per cent of semi-aromatic polyamide,  15 to 25 weight per cent of glass fibre, 10 to 20 
weight per cent of graphite, 10 to 20 weight per cent  
 
of polytetrafluoroethylene and up to 5 weight per cent 
of silicon oil.   The semi-aromatic polyamide may be "Ultramid T" 
(Registered Trade Mark) obtainable from BASF. "Ultramid T" 
is a trade name for nylon 6/6 T resins that contain both 
aromatic and aliphatic building blocks and are intended for 
injection moulding or extrusion. It is produced by 
polycondensation of caprolactam, hexamethylene diamine, and 
terephthalic acid. By the term "silicon oil" is intended 
a polymethylsiloxane which has a high viscosity. A plain bearing material in accordance with the 
invention is found to exhibit significantly better wear 
characteristics than existing materials and, accordingly, 
can be utilised over a greater range of pressures and 
temperatures. The results obtained are considerably 
superior to those which might have been expected from the 
addition of graphite to the composition. Indeed as Table 
2 of the attached Tables shows, unfilled Ultramid T 
performed less well than unfilled Nylon 6.6, but, contrary 
to expectations, a material according to the invention was 
superior to a material containing nylon 6.6 instead of 
Ultramid T. Preferably, in a bearing material in accordance with 
the invention, the composition comprises 1 to 3 weight per 
cent of the silicon oil. The graphite and the 
polytetrafluoroethylene
