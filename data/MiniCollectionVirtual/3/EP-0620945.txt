<ABSTRACT>
The basis is formed by cassettes containing an integral store (M) for cassette characteristics like type and length of tape, type of recording, signal pre-emphasis, etc. The aim is to make such cassettes with stores simple and economical to produce and avoid expensive assembly operations for the store and the contacts. The surface (4) of the cassette housing (1) takes the form of a chip card with an integrated semiconductor store (M) and integrated externally accessible contacts (K). In particular, novel cassette for digital video recording.

<CLAIMS>
Cassette including a recording medium for a recording 
apparatus in which a memory for characteristic values of the 

cassette and/or other items of data, which can be electrically 
contacted by the apparatus, is arranged on the cassette housing 

and a semiconductor memory (M) having contacts (K) that are 
externally accessible is arranged on a surface (4) of the 

cassette housing (1), characterised in that, the memory (M) is 
integrated in a housing part in which a punched-out chip card 

part forms a housing wall of the cassette housing. 
Cassette in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that, 
the contacts (K) are located adjacent to each other near to the, 

or at the, front upper edge of the cassette housing (1), at 
which the access to the recording medium in the apparatus takes 

place. 
Cassette in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that, 
the surface (4) has a marking position (5) having variable light 

transmissivity which can, together with a light barrier that is 
present in the apparatus, selectively serve for activating or 

lifting a bar on recording in accordance with the current light 
transmissivity. 
Cassette in accordance with claim 3, characterised in that, 
means are provided with which a marking position (5) that was 

transparent when manufactured can be closed or can be made non-transparent 
or less transparent. 
Cassette in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that, 
means are provided on the cassette housing (1) which prevent a 

destructively high static charging of the contacts (K) of the 
memory (M) in the cassette. 
Recording apparatus for a cassette in accordance with claim 
1, characterised in that, there is provided in the apparatus a 

spring contact set which contacts the contacts (K) of the  
 

cassette during or after its insertion and which is connected to 
an evaluating circuit.
