<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of aluminosilicates 
of the zeolite P type as low temperature calcium binders. 
These materials are specifically useful in detergents 
formulations in which they remove calcium and magnesium ions 
by ion exchange and which are to be used at ambient 
temperature. These aluminosilicates will be referred to as 
zeolites P in this description. The zeolite P class includes a series of synthetic zeolite 
phases which may be in cubic configuration (also termed B or 
Pc) or tetragonal configuration (also termed P1) but is not 
limited to these forms. The structure and characteristics of 
the zeolite P class are given in "zeolite Molecular Sieves" 
of Donald W Breck (published 1974 and 1984 by Robert E 
Krieger of Florida U.S.A.). The zeolite P class has the 
typical oxide formula: 
M2/nO. Al2O3. 1.80 - 5.00 SiO2. 5H2O 
M is an n-valent cation which for this invention is an alkali 
metal, that is lithium, potassium, sodium, caesium or 
rubidium with sodium and potassium being preferred and sodium 
being the cation normally used in commercial processes. Thus sodium may be present as the major cation with another 
alkali metal present in a minor proportion to provide 
specific benefit. In the present invention crystalline P-zeolites having a 
Si:Al ratio from 0.9 to 1.33 are used. The utility of zeolites P in detergents formulations has been 
acknowledged. For example, European Patent Application  
 
0384070 (Unilever) discloses the use of a specific zeolite 
P as detergency builders. In EP0384070, comparisons of calcium binding capacity and 
calcium uptake rate are made between the specific zeolite 
P which is disclosed in that document and zeolite 4A. The 
use of zeolite P as calcium binder at temperatures of 
22+2°C is disclosed. It has now been found that certain zeolites P prove to 
have, at a temperature as low as 5°C, a very high calcium 
binding capacity as well as a very good rate of calcium 
ion uptake. Therefore, those materials are very useful as 
calcium binders when used at low temperature, i.e. below 
25°C. Specifically, those materials are useful in 
detergents compositions which are used at ambient 
temperature. A first object of the present invention is a process for 
washing fabrics at a temperature below 25°C, for at least 
a part of a washing cycle, with a detergent composition 
comprising a surfactant system, a detergency builder 
system and optionally other conventional components, the 
detergency builder system comprising a zeolite P type 
having the
