<ABSTRACT>
A quick-fixing device for accessories in a two-wheel vehicle, in 
particular for windscreens, which is insertable into a sleeve 

element (13) to be fixed to the vehicle structure, in particular to the 
handlebar (12), comprising at least one rod portion (11) 

carrying expandable 
elements (23) which are to be inserted into said sleeve element and are 

operable by a lever (16) associated with relative 
thrust means (22) between 

an expanded position of engagement with the interior of said 
sleeve element and a rest position withdrawable from said sleeve 

element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a quick-fixing device for connecting accessories in 
a two-wheel vehicle, in particular for windscreens. Connection devices of various types are used for positioning 
accessories, such as a windscreen, on a two-wheel vehicle. These 
connection devices of known type consist of conical connectors 
fixed at one end to the handlebar by studs or bolts and at the 
other end to the windscreen via sleeve elements also fixable by 
bolts. To mount other accessories such as parcel racks, rearview 
mirrors etc., connection devices are used consisting of a 
plurality of component parts also to be fixed by one or more 
bolts. These known devices are firstly of fairly high price because of 
their rather complex construction. In addition their positioning 
requires spanners and similar tools, in addition to a certain time 
for arranging the parts and fixing them together. DE-C-876164 relates a device according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Although in this prior art device the need 
of a tool is eliminated, the device appears to be complicated 
and, because of the structure of the operating lever, not very 
efficient. FR-A-2567212 shows a device for the assembly of elements which uses 
expandable elements.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a quick-fixing 
device which enables an accessory, such as a windscreen, to be efficiently 
and almost immediately mounted on part of the vehicle structure, such 
as the handlebar.  
 A further object is to provide a quick-fixing device which is of 
extremely simple construction, leading to a reduction in 
manufacturing costs. These objects are attained according to the present invention by a 
quick-fixing device according to claim 1. The structural and operational characteristics and advantages of a 
fixing device according to the present invention will be more 
apparent from the following description given by way of non-limiting 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a section through a first embodiment of a quick-fixing 
device of the present invention in its mounted and locked 
position; Figure 2 is a section through the device of Figure 1 in its 
unlocked position; Figure 3 is a plan view of the device in the direction of the 
arrow F of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a section through a second embodiment of a quick-fixing 
device of the present invention in its mounted and locked  
 
position; Figure 5 is a section through the device of Figure 4 in its 
unlocked position; Figure 6 is a plan view of the

<CLAIMS>
A quick-fixing device for connecting accessories in 
a two-wheel vehicle, in particular for windscreens, 

comprising a sleeve element (13) to be fixed to a two-wheel 
vehicle structure, in particular to the handlebar 

(12), at least one rod portion (11;34), to be inserted 
into said sleeve element (23), carrying expandable 

elements which are operable by a lever (16;116) 
associated with a relative thrust ring (22) between an 

expanded position of engagement with the interior of 
said sleeve element (13) and a rest position in which 

said rod portion is withdrawable from said sleeve 
element (13), at one end, on said rod portion (11;34), said 

expandable elements (23) being provided with elements 
(15,25,26;125) for restraining their axial movement and 

at the other end being provided with said thrust ring (22) 
operable by said lever (16;116), characterised in that 

said lever (16;116) comprises at one end a cavity (17) 
within which said rod portion (11;34) passes and said 

one end of said lever (16;116) is provided with at 
least one pair of mutually perpendicular surfaces 

(18,18'; 19,19') positioned at different distances from 
the centre of said cavity (17), said surfaces of said 

lever interacting between a widened annular element 
(14) provided on said rod portion (11;34) and said  

 
thrust ring (22) in order to displace said expandable 

elements (23) between said expanded position and rest 
position.  

 
A fixing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said expandable elements (23) consist of at least one centrally 

holed plug mounted on said at least one rod portion (11; 34). 
A fixing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said thrust ring (22) is of frusto-conical shape at that end 

facing said sleeve element (13). 
A fixing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that between said lever (16;116) and said thrust ring (22) there is interposed a 

plate (30,31) to which an accessory can be fixed.  
 
A fixing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said rod portion (11) extends into a rod of an accessory. 
A fixing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said end of said lever (16;116) is of rectangular shape in 

longitudinal section.
