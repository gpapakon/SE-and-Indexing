<ABSTRACT>
An improved broaching tool for a broaching machine comprises 
an elongated tool body (10) capable of being secured to a 

tool carrier of the broaching machine and having a plurality 
of openings in the form of transverse slots (16) for 

receiving respective cutting inserts (20). Cutting inserts 
(20) received in the slots (16) are transversely adjustable 

and are indexable providing a number of cutting surfaces 
with each insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a broaching tool. A broaching tool such as is suitable for the roughing of 
firtree and dovetail slots in turbine, compressor and 
turbocharger discs, is subject to a high rate of wear 
due to the abrasive nature and hardness of the materials 
being broached and the inherent severity of this 
particular metal removing process. These conditions are 
further compounded by the fact that all material removed 
by the cutting action has no free egress from the space 
in front of the cutting edge of each insert and, in that 
space, such material is constantly in motion and 
increasing in volume during the total time the cutting 
insert is in contact with the workpiece. In order to at least minimise these wear effects and to 
provide the opportunity for faster than conventional 
cutting speeds, the present invention provides a 
broaching tool for a broaching machine comprising an 
elongated tool body capable of being secured to a tool 
carrier of the broaching machine and having a plurality 
of openings in the form of transverse slots to receive 
respective cutting inserts made of a wear resistant 
material, the inserts being detachable mounted relative 
to respective insert cartridges which are themselves 
detachably securable in the respective openings in the 
body. The cartridges can be adjusted in position 
transversely within the slots to obtain the correct 
lateral position of each cutting insert relative to the 
preceding or following cutting insert. The cartridges 
are arranged to carry right or left hand cutting inserts 
and in a preferred embodiment there are alternate right 
and left hand cutting inserts mounted along the length 
of the body at respective right and left longitudinal 
edges of the tool body, for presentation to a workpiece.  The cutting inserts are themselves indexable and 
replaceable in a simple and quick manner without the need 
for complete disassembly. The slots may be either 
perpendicular to the longituindal axis of the body or 
slightly inclined relative to a line normal thereto and 
may extend transversely either perpendicular to the 
longitudinal side edges of the body or slightly inclined 
relative to a line normal thereto. The actual angles of 
the slots are selected in accordance with the nature of 
the material being cut. Suitably, the cutting inserts are disposed on cartridges 
wherein the cutting edges are co-planar to provide a 
flat, machined surface. An embodiment of the present invention will now be 
described by way of example with
