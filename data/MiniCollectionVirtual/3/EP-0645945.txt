<ABSTRACT>
A flashing light warning device for use in vehicles has a voltage converter which is fed by the electric system of the vehicle by means of a converter controller, an energy store which is charged with the voltage generated by the voltage converter and which, together with a flash tube, forms a lamp circuit, and an ignition stage (trigger stage) which is connected to the flash tube and to a clock generator. The ignition stage generates ignition pulses for igniting the flash tube as a function of the clock signals of the clock generator. In order to protect, as well as possible, people from harm when they come into contact with parts of the device which carry high voltage, the device is provided with the following features: a current sensor is arranged in the lamp circuit, the current sensor is connected to a fault current recognition system, the fault current recognition system is connected to the clock generator, the fault current recognition system logically combines the clock signal from the clock generator to the signal from the current sensor, a fault signal is generated only outside the pulse time of the light flashes, and the fault current recognition system is connected to the converter controller for switching off the voltage converter only if a fault signal is present.
