<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drive shafts for use in 
progressive cavity pumps or motors. In these pumps or 
motors, a drive shaft is used between the drive and the 
rotor, since the rotor orbits about the centre line of the 
stator in the opposite sense to the rotation of the rotor. 
The drive shaft may take the form of either a rigid coupling 
rod with flexible joints at each end, or a flexible drive 
shaft. The flexible shaft has a number of advantages over 
the coupling rod, namely a smaller number of parts, no 
wearing or dynamic sealing parts, and consequent ease of 
assembly and maintenance. The flexible drive shaft is subject to a 
combination of torsional stress, alternating bending stress 
(induced by the orbiting and rotating motion of the rotor) 
and tensile or compressive axial stress (from axial loads on 
the rotor). Hence the design of a flexible drive shaft is 
considerably influenced by the yield and fatigue strength of 
the shaft material. Conventionally, stainless steels are 
used in the as machined condition without heat treatment. 
This leads to a long structure as compared to coupling rods. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of producing a flexible drive shaft for a 
progressive cavity pump or motor, comprising the steps of:-
 
   forming the shaft of a steel;
 
   hardening and tempering the shaft; and,
 
   nitriding or nitro-carburizing the shaft after 
hardening and tempering. The shaft may, for example, be formed by forging 
and machining. The steel may, for instance, be one of the Hot 
Work Tool Steels, Cold Work Tool Steels, or any other steel 
which allows the combination of hardening, tempering and 
subsequent nitriding or nitro-carburizing without loss of 
core strength.  Hot Work Tool Steels have hitherto been known for 
their hardness and high temper resistance, and have hence 
found application in for instance hot forging dies, where 
these properties are most important. The applicants have found that these steels in the 
hardened and tempered condition combine a very high tensile 
strength with a very high fatigue endurance limit. 
Furthermore, the high temper resistance allows the fatigue 
endurance limit to be further enhanced by the subsequent 
nitriding or nitro-carburizing without loss of core tensile 
strength. This allows flexible drive shafts made from these 
steels to be designed significantly shorter than shafts made 
from conventional steels. The invention also provides a helical gear pump or 
motor comprising a flexible drive
