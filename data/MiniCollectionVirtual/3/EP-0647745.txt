<ABSTRACT>
A brick structure includes a first brick body (1) and a second brick body 
(1) connected to the first brick body (1) in an upside-down manner, each of 

the brick bodies having a first surface (11) with a number of projections 
(12) formed thereon and a second surface (16) opposite to and substantially 

parallel with the first surface (11) with a number of recesses (121) 
corresponding to the projections (12) formed thereon, the projections (12) 

being corresponding in shape and size to and thus receivable within the 
recesses (121) so as to have the projections (11) of the first brick body 

(1) juxtaposing the recesses (121) of the second brick body (1) with upper 
ends of the projections (11) of one of the first and second brick bodies (1) 

slightly lower than the second surface (16), on which the recesses (121) are 
formed, of the other one of the first and second brick bodies. The brick is 

constituted by a concrete outer shell enclosing therein a buffering core made 
of polylone (15) with a metal net (14) sandwiched therebetween to provide 

impact absorption and reinforcement to the brick structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a brick structure. Bricks are important building elements. Conventional 
bricks are generally in the form of parallelepiped solid 
body. Such bricks are easy to move relative to the adjacent 
bricks in brick laying so that accurate positioning of 
bricks should be done by manual adjustment. This requires a 
great amount of labor and time and thus cost. Since the conventional bricks are parallelepiped bodies 
which are easy to move relative to each other when laid 
together, although in laying bricks, mixture of cement and 
sand is used to adhere the bricks together, the capability 
of the bricks against external forces may not be 
satisfactory. Further, conventional bricks are manufactured by firing 
clay blocks. Theses clay blocks are generally solid without 
any substantial cavity therein so as to have quite a weight. 
This causes inconvenience in the transportation and laying 
of the bricks. Moreover, since the conventional bricks are fired solid 
clay body without any reinforcement or buffering material 
therein, they may not be strong enough against external 
impacts acting thereon. Sometimes, the conventional bricks  
 
are broken into pieces by the external impacts during 
transportation. Furthermore, the conventional bricks are poor in heat-insulation 
and sound-isolation so that the building that 
constructed with the conventional bricks is also poor in 
heat-insulation and sound-isolation. It is therefore desirable to provide an improved brick 
structure which overcomes the above-mentioned deficiencies. The principal objective of the present invention is to 
provide an improved brick structure which overcomes the 
previously-mentioned deficiencies of the conventional brick 
and to achieve the objective, there is provided a brick 
structure comprising a first brick body and a second brick 
body connected to the first brick body in an upside-down 
manner, each of the brick bodies having a first surface with 
a number of projections formed thereon and a second surface 
opposite to and substantially parallel with the first 
surface with a number of recesses corresponding to the 
projections formed thereon, the projections being 
corresponding in shape and size to and thus receivable 
within the recesses so as to have the projections of the 
first brick body juxtaposing the recesses of the second 
brick body with upper ends of the projections of one of the 
first and second brick bodies slightly lower than the second 
surface, on which the recesses are formed, of

<CLAIMS>
A brick structure comprising at least a brick body 
having a first surface with a number of projections 

formed thereon and a second surface opposite to and 
substantially parallel with the first surface with a 

number of recesses corresponding to the projections 
formed thereon, said projections being corresponding in 

shape and size to and thus receivable within said 
recesses so that when said brick is laid on a second 

similar brick, the projections of said second brick are 
received within the recesses of said first brick to 

provide a precise positioning of said first brick 
relative to said second brick. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 1 further 
comprising a second brick body connected to the first 

brick body in an upside-down manner so as to have the 
projections of said first brick body juxtaposing the 

recesses of said second brick body with upper ends of 
the projections of one of the first and second brick 

bodies slightly lower than the second surface, on which 
the recesses are formed, of the other one of said first 

and second brick bodies and thus when said brick is 

laid on a second similar brick, the projections of the 
first brick body of said second brick are received 

within the recesses of the first brick body of said 
 

first brick and the projections of the second brick 
body of said first brick are received within the 

recesses of the second brick body of said second brick 
to provide a precise positioning of said first brick 

relative to said second brick. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said 
brick body comprises a concrete outer shell enclosing a 

buffering core therein with a metal net sandwiched 
therebetween to provide impact absorption and 

reinforcement to the concrete shell. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said 
buffering core is made of polylone. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 2 wherein said 
brick constituted by the first and second brick bodies 

comprises a concrete outer shell extending to both the 
first and second brick bodies, enclosing a buffering 

core therein with a metal net sandwiched therebetween 
to provide impact absorption and reinforcement to the 

concrete shell. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 5 wherein said 
buffering core is made of polylone. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said 
projections comprises truncated cones convergent in the 

direction away from the first surface of said brick 
body. 
A brick structure as claimed in Claim 2 wherein said 
projections comprises truncated cones convergent in the 

direction away from the first surface of each of said 
brick bodies.
