<ABSTRACT>
The cutting material consists of a basic carbide body and a multilayer coating of mechanically resistant material. The basic body and coating of mechanically resistant material are specifically matched to one another, as a result of which the cutting material is exceptionally well suited to the cutting of both steel and cast iron.
