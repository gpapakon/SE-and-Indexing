<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for showering and disinfection of a sanitary facility 
includes a first shower (20), a first operating device (22) for 

opening or closing the supply of liquid to the first shower, and a 
first conduit (24) for supplying water to the shower. A tank (25) is 

disposed in the first conduit (24) and is connected, via a first 
inlet pipe (24a) of the first conduit, to a supply pipe (30) and is 

connected by a second conduit section (24b), to the shower (20). The 
first conduit section (24) discharges in the tank (25) above a highest 

permitted filling level, whereby there is created an air gap 
between liquid in the tank and the discharge (37) of the conduit section. 

Downstream of the air gap, a device (26) is coupled in for the 
supply of disinfectant to the storage space of the tank, or to the 

second conduit section (24b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus according to the preamble 
of the independent claim. There are needs in many contexts to be able, in a simple and rapid 
manner, to disinfect sanitary facilities and washing areas and the 
equipment located there. Such needs exist, for example, at hospitals, 
nursing facilities, public baths, sports centres etc. It is highly 
desirable in such contexts that the disinfectant can be supplied to 
the sanitary facility by a simple operation, for example employing a 
permanently installed shower apparatus already available in the sanitary 
facility. In such applications, use is often made of permanent 
installations which are connected to the water mains. In these installations, 
the disinfectant is added and mixed with water which is taken 
from the water mains. In such instance, there is a certain risk 
that, in the event of partial vacuum in the water mains, the disinfectant 
is sucked back into the mains. Since the water mains also 
distribute drinking water, even a minor risk of such resuction is, 
naturally, unacceptable. In order to prevent resuction of, for example, 
hot water, through a faucet or from a water heater, use is normally 
made of one or more non-return valves. Since a resuction of 
disinfectant may have very serious consequences, the safety afforded 
by one or more non-return valves is considered insufficient. The present invention discloses a technique which satisfies the 
above-outlined needs at the same time as the contemplated increased 
level of safety against resuction is achieved. According to the invention, 
a technique is employed which wholly precludes every possibility 
of resuction of water mixed with disinfectant, or undiluted 
disinfectant. The contemplated effect is achieved employing that 
technology which is disclosed in the characterizing clause of the 
independent claim.  Expedient embodiments of the present invention are disclosed in the 
dependent claims. The present invention will now be described in greater detail hereinbelow 
with reference to a number of figures, in which; 
Fig. 1shows a first embodiment of the apparatus; and Fig. 2shows a second embodiment of the apparatus, with central control 
and regulator devices. Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 is a skeleton diagram of one embodiment 
of an apparatus according to the invention. The apparatus 
comprises a first shower 20, a first operating device 22 for turning 
the first shower on or off, a first conduit 24 for supplying water to 
the first shower 20 from a
