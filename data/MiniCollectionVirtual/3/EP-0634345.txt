<ABSTRACT>
A warehouse comprising a plurality of levels (LE1-LEn) exhibits an integrated storage and/or retrieval area (SE) which is arranged between two storage levels. The storage/retrieval level (SE) can be served directly by the storage and retrieval units (RBG1-RBG5) of the warehouse. The warehouse itself has storage channels (LK), filled in accordance with the "first-in-last-out" principle, and also has individual set-down spaces (E) with optional access.

<CLAIMS>
Store with parallel storage rows (L1-L6)
arranged in several planes, each storage row consisting

of storage areas (E,S) adjacent to each other for
material to be loaded which is located in particular on

loading aids, and within a respective storage row the
storage areas can be multiplied in each case by a

factor n by a depth stepping to form storage channels,
whereby between two respective storage rows (L1-L6) a

shelf lane for a shelf control unit (RBG1 to RBG5) is
formed and whereby between two storage planes (LE1-LEn)

lying one on top of the other at least one storage
and/or withdrawal plane is provided, which in the

region of the shelf lanes has openings for the shelf
control units (RBG1 to RBG5), characterized in that a

shelf control unit (RBG1 to RBG5) of n storage areas
(E,S) of the storage channels lying on one side of a

shelf lane controls n-1 storage areas (S) and one
storage area (E) of the storage channels of the

opposite side of the shelf lane.
Store according to claim 1, whereby the
storage plane is designed as a sorting plane (SE) for

material to be loaded, whereby the respective end
sorting points (ES) are located in the region of the

openings of the associated storage areas (E,S) which
lie above them or below them.
Store according to claim 2, whereby the
sorting plane (SE) has an automatic sorting system, for

example a tipping tray sorting system (KS).
