<ABSTRACT>
A combined linear-rotary stepping motor shares stator 
iron plates and mover iron cores for a linear motor portion 

and a rotary motor portion without lengthening the length in 
the shaft direction. 
The combined linear-rotary stepping motor includes a 
stator 1 having a stator iron core 10 provided with a 

plurality of salient poles 11, 12, 13, ... composed of the 
salient poles having a plurality of first stator teeth 24 

formed in inner peripheral surfaces thereof in the direction 
of a shaft 21 and the salient poles having a plurality of 

second stator teeth 25 formed in inner peripheral surfaces 
thereof in the circumferential direction and a mover 2 having 

mover iron cores 22a and 22b supported within the stator 1 
movably in the shaft direction and rotatably and provided 

with a plurality of mover teeth 26 formed in outer peripheral 
surfaces thereof at an equal pitch in the shaft direction and 

the circumferential direction in opposing relation to the 
first and second stator teeth 24, 25. The stator iron core 

10 is formed by laminating stator iron plates 30 while 
rotating the plates by a predetermined angle so that the 

first stator teeth 24 are formed in the inner peripheral 
surfaces of the specified salient poles in the shaft 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined linear-rotary 
stepping motor. As a motor of this kind in a field relating to the 
present invention, U.S. patent No. 5,093,596 discloses a 
combined linear-rotary direct drive step motor including a 
cylindrical three-phase variable reluctance type linear pulse 
motor portion and a hybrid type rotary step motor portion or 
a three-phase variable reluctance type rotary step motor 
portion disposed side by side in the shaft direction and 
having a common output shaft. Both of the motor portions are 
accommodated in one housing. However, the combined linear-rotary direct drive step 
motor has the following problems: 
(1) Since the linear motor portion and the rotary motor 
portion are disposed side by side in the shaft direction, the 
length thereof in the shaft direction is lengthened. (2) A stator of the linear motor portion includes stator 
iron plates and spacer iron plates which are laminated 
alternately. When a stator iron core is manufactured, two  
 
kinds of iron plates must be laminated alternately and tips 
of salient poles must be bent alternately. Accordingly, the 
stator iron core cannot be manufactured easily. (3) Three kinds of iron plates including the stator iron 
plates for the rotary motor portion, the stator iron plates 
for the linear motor portion and the spacer iron plates are 
required. (4) Two stators for the linear motor portion and the rotary 
motor portion are required and it is necessary to assemble 
the two stators in the shaft direction after windings and 
connection works have been made separately. Accordingly, the 
assembling work efficiency of the whole motor is 
deteriorated. (5) When a permanent magnet is disposed within the mover, 
two kinds of movers are also required to be disposed on the 
same shaft. Accordingly, the configuration thereof is 
complicated and the assembling efficiency is deteriorated. [I] The present invention has been made in order to solve 
the above problems and an object of the present invention is 
to provide a combined linear-rotary stepping motor including 
stator iron plates and a mover iron core which can be shared 
by a linear motor portion and a rotary motor portion and 
having a length in the shaft direction which is not  
 
lengthened and excellent assembling work efficiency of the 
whole motor. 
In order to achieve the above object, there is provided a combined linear-rotary stepping motor as defined in the claims. The combined 
linear-rotary stepping motor of the present invention 
comprises
