<ABSTRACT>
Method of working up residues containing dihydroxy compounds, which are obtained in the preparation of polyesters by reaction of dicarboxylic acids or their esters or ester-forming derivatives with dihydroxy compounds, where   a) in a first stage a diester of a dicarboxylic acid is transesterified with an alkanol using a molar excess of a dihydroxy compound, b) the vapours obtained in the reaction as in a), which mainly contain the alkanol formed in the transesterification, excess dihydroxy compounds and oligomeric and polymeric reaction products, are transferred to a column in which the alkanol is removed at the top and the other products as the bottom product, and c) the bottom product is then subjected to a further treatment to recover the dihydroxy compound, where in stage b) of the process a liquid residue containing dihydroxy compounds is added and the bottom product is discharged from the column in mainly liquid form and is then subjected to a treatment to recover the dihydroxy compound.

A process for working up residues which contain 
dihydroxy compounds and are obtained in the preparation 

of polyesters by reacting dicarboxylic acids or their 
esters or ester-forming derivatives with dihydroxy 

compounds, 

a) in a first stage a diester of a dicarboxylic acid 
with an alkanol being subjected to transesterification 

with a molar excess of a dihydroxy compound, 
b) the vapors which are obtained in the reaction 
according to a) and contain predominantly the 

alkanol formed in the transesterification, excess 
dihydroxy compounds and oligomeric and polymeric 

reaction products being transferred to a column in 
which the alkanol is separated off via the top and 

the other products are separated off as a bottom 
product, and 
c) the bottom product being then subjected to a further 
treatment to recover the dihydroxy compound, 
 
wherein a liquid residue containing dihydroxy compounds 

is added in stage b) of the process, and the bottom 
product is discharged in substantially liquid form from 

the column and then subjected to a treatment for recovering 
the dihydroxy compound.
