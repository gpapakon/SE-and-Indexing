<ABSTRACT>
4-amino-2-buten-1-ol is formed by the regioselective addition of primary amines to 3,4-epoxy-1-butene. A quantity of the primary amine is reacted with 3,4-epoxy-1-butene in a reaction medium in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction medium is a liquid which has an ET(30) no less than about 32. The catalyst is a complex of palladium and phosphine ligands. A method of forming 4-amino-2-buten-1-ol using 3,4-epoxy-1-butene is disclosed. A nitrogen nucleophile (e.g., an amine) is reacted with 3,4-epoxy-1-butene in the presene of a polymer-bound complex of palladium having up to four phosphine ligands.

<DESCRIPTION>
A process is disclosed for reacting 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
with an amine to produce a 4-amino-substituted-2-buten-1-ol. A variety of 4-aminobutenols are known to 
have use themselves or as intermediates for the 
preparation of other chemical substances. For example, 
4-dimethylamino-2-buten-1-ol could be used in the 
preparation of 4-dimethylaminobutyraldehyde diethyl 
acetal, an intermediate for a pharmaceutical compound, 
as disclosed in German Patent No. 3,700,408. 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (butadiene monoepoxide) is 
one potential substrate for the production of 4-aminobutenols. 
However, the reaction of nitrogen 
nucleophiles (e.g., amines) with 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
typically yields a mixture of the 1,2 addition product 
(1,2 adduct) and the 2,1 addition product (2,1 adduct), 
and little or none of the 1,4 addition product (1,4 
adduct). The reaction is illustrated below: 
See, e.g., M. G. Ettlinger, "Synthesis of the Natural 
Antithyroid Factor 1-5-Vinyl-2-Thiooxazolidone", 72 J. 
Amer. Chem. Soc. 4792-4795 (1950); United States Patent 
No. 2,533,085 to Blicke; W. B. Wheatley, et al., "o-Benzylphenyl 
Derivatives. IV. beta-Chloroethylamines", 
72 J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1655-1659 (1950);  
 
M. P. Crozet and W. Kassar, "Synthesis and Radical 
Cyclization of Benzazepinoethane Thiols", 99 Compte 
Rendu Acad. Sci. Paris 99-101 (1985); United States 
Patent No. 2,497,553 to Long, Jr.; A. A. Petrov and V. 
M. Albitskaya, "The Reaction of Divinyloxide with 
Amines", 26 Zhur. Obshchei Khim. 2125-2127 (1956); and 
F. F. Blicke and J. H. Biel, "Aminolysis Products of 1-Chloro-2-Hydroxy-3-butene, 
1-Hydroxy-2-Chloro-3-butene 
and 1,2-Epoxy-3-butene", 79 J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 5508-12 
(1957). The regioselective addition of nitrogen 
nucleophiles to substrates to form 4-aminobutenols (the 
1,4 adduct product) is extremely unpredictable in both 
result and yield. For example, in Tsuji, et al., 
"Regioselective 1,4-Addition of Nucleophiles to 1,3-Diene 
Monoepoxides Catalyzed by Palladium Complex", 22 
Tetrahedron Letters 2575-78 (1981), the formation of 
the 1,4 adduct from the palladium catalyzed reaction of 
3,4-epoxy-1-dodecene and pyrrolidine is disclosed. 
Also, Trost, et al., "A Synthesis of Substituted 
Pyrrolidines via a Palladium(2+) Catalyzed Cyclization. 
An Unusual Approach to a Carbapenem", 108 J. Amer. 
Chem. Soc. 6053-54 (1986) discloses the formation of 
the 1,4 adduct from the addition of a nitrogen 
nucleophile to 3,4-epoxy-1-butene. On the other hand,
