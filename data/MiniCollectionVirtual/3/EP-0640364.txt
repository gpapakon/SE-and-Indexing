<ABSTRACT>
Game element which mainly consists of an oblong hollow 
body (2) and an element (3) which is applied in the above-mentioned 

hollow body in a freely movable manner, 
characterized in that the hollow body (2) is composed of 

several separate parts (4, 5; 19, 20, 21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a game element, more 
specifically a game element which can be used for playing 
a game and as a toy in itself, individually or in a group. 
The invention also relates to a device for applying the 
above-mentioned game element. More specifically, the invention relates to a game element 
of the type which mainly consists of an oblong hollow body 
and an element which is applied in the above-mentioned 
body in a freely movable manner. When such above-mentioned game element is placed on an 
inclined plane, the game element moves downward along the 
inclined plane, whereby it exerts a toppling movement. It is clear that when using several game elements in a 
group, games between the different players can be 
organized, whereby it can for instance be the objective to 
move such game element in the shortest period of time off 
an inclined plane, thus giving the game element a 
competitive character. A game element of the above-mentioned type is known from 
the patents DE 52.545 and GB 197.110, as well as from 
German utility model No. 92 01 676. The hollow body of 
the game elements disclosed therein is one whole. The invention aims at a game element which offers, due to 
its construction, several advantages with respect to the 
known embodiments of which the hollow body is one whole. To this end, the invention consists of a game element, 
which mainly consists of an oblong hollow body and an 
element which is applied in the above-mentioned hollow  
 
body in a freely movable manner, characterized in that the 
hollow body is composed of several separate parts. As the hollow body is composed of several separate parts, 
the advantage is obtained that the game element can be 
assembled easily, more specifically that the movable 
element can easily be applied therein, either during 
manufacturing or afterwards. Preferably, the parts are connected in a removable manner, 
so that the movable element can at any time be removed 
from the hollow body and replaced, and so that during the 
production the parts can be connected without any specific 
technique. It is clear that in the latter case different additional 
game possibilities are offered, for instance in that, as 
desired, different movable elements, for instance with a 
different weight, can be applied in the hollow body. In 
the case of transparent hollow bodies, movable elements of 
different colours can be applied, to thus create a 
distinction. The simple construction also offers the advantage that 
production costs and possibly

<CLAIMS>
Game element which mainly consists of an oblong 
hollow body (2) and an element (3) which is applied in the 

above-mentioned hollow body in a freely movable manner, 
characterized in that the hollow body (2) is composed of 

several separate parts (4, 5; 19, 20, 21). 
Game element according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the body (2) has a circular cross-section. 
Game element according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the above-mentioned parts 

consist of cooperating sleeve-shaped elements (4, 5) each 
with a rounded closed extremity (6, 7). 
Game element according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the above-mentioned parts consist of a cylindrical 

middle part (19) and two sleeve-shaped end parts (20, 21) 
applied thereto, each with a rounded closed extremity (22, 

23). 
Game element according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the different parts have 

different diameters so that they fit over each other at 
their extremities, in order to connect them mutually. 
Game element according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the different parts are 

connected to each other by means of one or more locks 
(10). 
Game element according to claim 6, characterized in 
that one of more of the locks (10) is conceived in such a 

way that it allows the repeated opening and closing of the 
hollow body (2). 
Game element according to claims 5 and 7, 
characterized in that the lock (10), the locks (10) 

respectively, consist of a circumferential groove (11) in 
the part with the larger diameter which cooperates with a 

circumferential rib (12) on the part with the smaller 
diameter. 
Game element according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the movable element (3) 

consists of a ball. 
Device which can be applied for using the abovementioned 
game element, characterized in that it mainly 

consists of a sloping plane (13) and a support (15) for 
the above-mentioned sloping plane (13), whereby the 

sloping plane (13) is divided in a number of parallel 
lanes (16), by means of upright walls (17).
