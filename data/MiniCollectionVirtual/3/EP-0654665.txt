<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for testing welded joints by means of the eddy-current method, large-volume and coarse-grained welded joints are subjected to testing, these welded joints being tested in layers on-line during their formation for the presence of defects. The method is particularly suitable for testing components with austenitic welding material. It is distinguished by a high defect-location probability.

<CLAIMS>
Method of testing weld seams using an eddy-current
technique, characterized in that, in the

testing of large-volume and coarse-grained weld seams,
which are built up from a plurality of layers, the

latter are tested in layers on-line during their
buildup.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the eddy-current testing is performed at elevated

workpiece temperatures.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the workpiece temperatures are up to 350Â°C.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the method is applied in the case of austenitic

parent materials and/or austenitic weld metal.
