<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to control of tool 
movement in machining operations. More specifically this invention relates to a 
differential cam mechanism which in machining 
operations facilitates controlled uniform 
movement to a tool revolving around a 
stationary job. Usually in many machining operations like 
turning or cutting operation, the job rotates 
and the tool is stationary. In circumstances 
where it is difficult to rotate the job the 
tool is made to revolve around the job and the 
job is kept stationary. Whenever the job is stationary and the tool is 
made to revolve around the job the revolving 
tool needs to be imparted controlled radial 
movement/feed to engage the job and carry out 
the machining operation. One of the existing practices for imparting 
controlled radial feed to a revolving tool is 
by using a cam and follower arrangement. In 
this arrangement a cam is statically mounted 
on the machine frame, adjacent to the 
periphery of the path of the revolving tool 
and the cam follower imparting radial movement  
 
to the tool is mounted beside the tool and 
revolves around the job along with the tool. 
The main disadvantage of this arrangement is 
that for each revolution of the tool around 
the job, the cam follower engages the cam only 
once and the radial feed to the tool is 
achieved only once for each revolution, in a 
single step thereby giving jerk to the tool, 
causing tool breakage, and/or instant 
overloading of the machine drive. Another known method for imparting controlled 
radial feed to the revolving tool is by using 
a gear arrangement, in which a gear wheel 
which imparts radial movement to the tool and 
rotates with the tool, is continuously engaged 
to another static gear-ring located in the 
path of the said gear wheel. Though this 
arrangement imparts a uniform radial feed, the 
main disadvantage of this arrangement is that 
the withdrawal of the tool requires a reverse 
run of the gear arrangement. Moreover the 
radial movement of the tool cannot be stopped 
wihout stopping it's revolution around the 
job, thereby preventing any horizontal or 
axial machining operation to be carried out on 
the job simultaneously. Some other known methods for imparting 
controlled radial feed to a revolving tool are 
by mounting electrical/electromagnetic, 
pneumatic or hydraulic tool drives on the 
revolving tool holders. The main drawback of  
 
these systems is that the power feed and the 
control line to the revolving tool holder make 
the system highly complicated and
