Method for detecting fault locations on pipes for 
transporting liquids with an inside pipe (1) conducting 

the medium, an outside pipe (2) surrounding the inside 
pipe (1), a filler material (3) in the intermediate 

space between both pipes, and a sensor (S) extending in 
the intermediate space for detecting the fault 

locations, and a line for detecting the data, 

characterized in that
 the sensor is additionally used to 
transmit the data (D). 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
data source and/or the data sink is coupled inductively 

or capacitively to the sensor (S). 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in a 
sensor (S) having a first conductor (A1) serving as a 

detector for a fault location, and having a second 
conductor (A2) serving as a return circuit, the second 

conductor is used to transmit the data (D). (Fig. 3, 4) 
Method according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
return circuits (A2) of the sensors (Sa, S2) are used by 

two parallel-extending pipes (R1, R2) as a symmetrical 
line for transmitting the data (D). (Fig. 4) 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
data (D) are digital signals and are tranmitted by 

frequency modulation of a carrier.  
 
Method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
data source or sink is connected to a first winding (W1) 

of a first transformer (Ãœ1), and its second winding (W2) 
is connected to two sensors (S1, S2) of two pipes (R1, 

R2), and that an energy source or sink is connected to a 
winding (W3), whose other winding (W4) lies between a 

tap of the second winding (W2) and the inside pipes (1) 
of the two pipes being electrically connected to one 

another. (Fig. 3) 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
sensor (S) is used to detect a fault location, transmit 

the data (D), and transmit an energy (E) for supplying 
active circuits at a location for measuring or 

evaluation. 
Method according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the 
sensor function is effected with a d.c. voltage, the 

data transmission with a modulated carrier having a 
frequency of 1 - 50 kHz, and the energy transmission 

with an a.c. voltage of 50 Hz.
