<ABSTRACT>
Packaging for substantially rectangular contents 
consisting of one or more articles, said packaging 

comprising:
 

   a substantially rectangular base flat (1);
 

   upright wall flats (2) connected to the edges of said 
base flat (1); as well as

 
   a lid flat connected to the top edges of said wall 

flats, for encasing the substantially rectangular contents, 
wherein said lid flat forms a blank (10) with at least one wall 

flat, said blank having wholly or partially detachable 
fastening means (6) for fixing said blank to the other flats. 
A packaging according to the invention is sufficiently 
sturdy to enable stacking, requires only a minimal 

amount of material and is very simple to take apart. Further 
a lighter material can be used for the closing blank, as 

there is no risk of damage by the bottom of a packaging 
placed on top, since this other packaging rests entirely on 

parts associated with the other flats manufactured of a 
stronger material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a packaging for encasing 
substantially rectangular contents consisting of one or more 
articles, said packaging comprising: a substantially 
rectangular base flat; upright wall flats connected to the 
edges of said base flat; as well as a lid flat connected to 
the top edges of said wall flats. It is known for transporting articles to make use 
of a packaging forming an integral unit, which packaging is 
opened at its destination and the content consisting of one 
or more articles is transferred to shelves. A drawback is 
that after unpacking the packaging is useless and is 
disposed of as waste. The transfer of the articles from the 
packaging to the shelves moreover costs a great deal of 
time, particularly when the sell-by date of the articles has 
to be taken into account, whereby newly arrived articles 
must be arranged behind articles already placed in the 
shelves. It is known in the prior art to utilize as a 
visual display arrangement one unit of a packaging 
consisting of two separate units manufactured from the same 
material, whereby a distinction can be made between a 
display unit and a closing unit. Herein at least the display 
unit is provided with designations for recognition and 
presentation of the articles. The display unit is opened in 
a number of planes in order to provide quite easy access to 
the contents. The closing unit closing the display unit 
covers at least the opened planes of the display unit and is 
fixed to the display unit using fastening means such as an 
adhesive tape or a tape which is arranged under tension 
round the display unit and the closing unit and holds both 
units together during transport. A drawback to the above described known art is 
that at the destination quite a lot of time and quite a few 
operations are still required to make the packaging suitable 
as a visual display arrangement. Furthermore, in the 
packaging consisting of a display unit and a closing unit  
 
considerably more material is required than in the case of a 
packaging consisting of one unit, since the closing unit 
must cover the opened planes of the display unit and must 
also clamp the sides connecting the opened planes to the 
adjoining wall flats since the adjoining wall flats will 
otherwise bend outward. Closing of this packaging, i.e. 
arranging the generally pre-manufactured closing unit over 
the generally pre-manufactured display unit, where the 
closing unit fits closely over the display unit, after the 
contents have been arranged in the
