<ABSTRACT>
Human interleukin-8 (IL-8) analogs that are modified in the Glu4Leu5Arg6 region, and have a core structure corresponding to the IL-8(7-51) sequence are provided. These neutrophil binding analogs display altered IL-8 activities that can be exploited for therapeutic and other purposes. Such antagonists include those in which, for example, the Leu

 and/or Arg
<

 residues are replaced, and in which the Glu
<
4
>
 and/or Leu
<
5
>
 residues are deleted. Also provided are biologically active human interleukin-8 (IL-8) analogs comprising a core sequence that includes IL-8(1-51), IL-8(3-51) or IL-8(4-51). This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the aforementioned analogs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the human cytokine,
interleukin-8.A human cytokine that promotes the recruitment and
activation of neutrophil leukocytes has been identified as
one of several endogenous mediators of the acute
inflammatory response. In the past it was variously termed
neutrophil-activating factor, monocyte-derived neutrophil
chemotactic factor, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and neutrophil-activating
peptide-1. IL-8 appears to have gained the
widest acceptance and the term will be used herein.The most abundant naturally occurring form of the IL-8
monomer is a 72-residue protein apparently derived by
processing of a 99-residue precursor. Other proteins with
related sequences, including neutrophil-activating peptide-2
and GROα (with melanoma growth stimulatory activity) are
IL-8 homologues which have neutrophil-activating
properties.The in vitro effects of IL-8 on neutrophils are
similar to those of other chemotactic agonists such as C5a
and fMet-Leu-Phe and include induction of a transient rise
in cytosolic free calcium, the release of granules
containing degradative enzymes such as elastase, the
respiratory H2O2 burst, neutrophil shape change, and
chemotaxis. IL-8 appears to bind to at least one class of
receptor sites on neutrophils with a frequency of
approximately 64,000/cell and a Kd of 0.2 nM.The three-dimensional structure of IL-8 is known by
two-dimensional NMR and x-ray diffraction techniques. The
IL-8 monomer has antiparallel β strands followed by a
single overlying COOH-terminal α helix. Two disulfide
bridges, between cysteines 7 and 34, and between cysteines 
9 and 50 seem to stabilize the tertiary structure.
Residues 1-6 and the loop residues 7-18 seem to have little
defined secondary structure. In solution, IL-8 is a
noncovalent homodimer which is stabilized primarily by
interactions between the β strands of the two monomers.Examination of the three-dimensional structure
indicates that following the cysteine at position 50, the
residues form a type 1 β turn (at residues 51 to 55)
followed by an amphipathic α helix (at residues 55 to 72)
that transverses the β sheet. The hydrophobic face of the
α helix interacts with and stabilizes the hydrophobic face
of the β sheet. Some of the interactions are between the
two subunits of the dimeric molecule.As it is established that IL-8 is a key mediator of
inflammatory diseases, it would be desirable to identify
substances capable of blocking or interrupting the activity
of IL-8 for use in anti-inflammatory compositions. Such
compositions may prove to
