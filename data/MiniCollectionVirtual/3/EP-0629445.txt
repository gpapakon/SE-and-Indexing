<ABSTRACT>
An evacuated blood collection assembly includes a plastic container 
having a plasma-treated inside wall surface and an open end covered by a 

puncturable septum. The inside wall surface may also be abraded to increase 
surface area. The invention included a method to make the assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention: This invention relates to blood collection and, 
more particularly, relates to a plastic blood sample collection assembly. 2. Background: Blood samples are routinely taken in evacuated tubes, 
such as glass VACUTAINER™ tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company). One 
end of a double-ended needle is inserted into a patient's vein. The other end 
of the needle then punctures a septum covering the open end of the 
VACUTAINER™ tube so that the vacuum in the tube draws the blood sample 
through the needle into the tube. Using this technique, a plurality of samples 
can be taken using a single needle puncture of the skin. Plastic tubes have 
also been proposed for blood collection. Plastic offers a number of 
advantages over glass such as lower breakage, less weight in shipment, and 
easier disposal by incineration. Blood collected in evacuated tubes often must be clotted prior to clinical 
examination. It is desirable to form a dense clot as rapidly and completely as 
possible to facilitate clean separation of the clot from the serum layer by 
centrifugation. To achieve this end, both plastic and glass blood collection 
tubes frequently employ a clot activator. Typical activators are diatomaceous 
earth and particles of inorganic silicates, or biochemicals such as ellagic acid 
and thromboplastin. In one line of commercial blood collection tubes, for 
example, a coating of silicate particles in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, a water 
soluble polymer) is affixed to the inside of the tube. When blood enters the 
tube, the PVP dissolves and silicate particles are released to initiate clotting. 
The PVP enters both the serum and clot. A problem with particulate activators is that finely divided particles may not  
 
pellet completely with the clot and may thus contaminate the serum layer and 
interfere with certain blood analyses. In addition, particles suspended in the 
serum may foul automatic blood analysis instruments. On the other hand, 
soluble biochemical activators can be disadvantageous because these cannot 
be easily separated from either the serum or blood clot and can interfere with 
both chemical and hematological assays. In particular, for highly specialized 
applications, such as blood banking, it is unacceptable to have either soluble 
activators or particulates in the cell mass of a blood clot because these cells 
are used in blood typing analyses. For this reason, samples for blood banking 
are routinely taken in glass tubes and rely on the clot activating property of the 
glas

A blood collection assembly comprising a plastic blood collection container 
having a bottom wall and a side wall defining an open end covered by a puncturable 

septum, said bottom wall, side wall, and septum enclosing an evacuated interior 
volume of said container, an interior wall surface of said container being abraded to 

have a rough surface, characterized in that 
said container is fabricated of a plastic selected from the group consisting of 

polystyrene, impact modified polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate, and in that 
said interior wall surface of said 

container is treated with a plasma from a process gas, the abraded and plasma-treated 
wall surface causing an accelerated rate of blood clotting in said container 

relative to the rate in an otherwise identical non-abraded and non-plasma treated 
container, such that the interior wall surface of said container has a clot activating 

property similar to and even somewhat greater than that of glass. 
The blood collection assembly of Claim 1 wherein said process gas is 
selected from the group consisting of air, oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia, carbon 

dioxide and sulfur dioxide. 
The assembly of Claim 1 wherein said container is polystyrene and said 
process gas is oxygen.  

 
A method for preparing a plastic blood collection assembly comprising: 

a) abrading an inside wall surface of a plastic container having an open end to 
increase its surface area; 
b) covering said open end with a puncturable septum; and 
c) evacuating the container covered by said septum; 
 
characterized by 


d) said container being fabricated of a plastic selected from the group consisting of 
polystyrene, impact modified polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate, and by 
e) exposing said inside wall surface 
of said container 

to a plasma from a process gas to give a 
plasma-treated inside wall surface; said abraded and plasma-treated wall 

surface having an accelerated rate of blood clotting relative to the rate in an 
otherwise identical non-abraded and non-plasma-treated container, such that the 

interior wall surface of said container has a clot activating 
property similar to and even somewhat greater than that 

of glass. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein said process gas is selected from the group 
consisting of air, oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.
