<ABSTRACT>
In a method for evaluating thickness of a semiconductor 
layer (20) epitaxially growing on a main surface of a 

substrate (1), a plurality of stripe-shaped ridges (12) 
extending in a prescribed direction are formed on the 

surface of the substrate, and a semiconductor layer (20) is 
epitaxially grown on the surface of the substrate including 

the stripe-shaped ridges while irradiating the stripe-shaped 
ridges with light (21) and monitoring diffracted light 

(22,23) from the stripe-shaped ridges to evaluate the 
thickness of the epitaxially growing semiconductor layer. 

Therefore, the thickness of the epitaxial layer is evaluated 
with high precision during the epitaxial growth process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
evaluating a semiconductor layer epitaxially grown on a 
substrate and, more particularly, to a method for evaluating 
the thickness of that layer during the epitaxial growth 
process with high precision. The present invention also relates to a test pattern 
for process evaluation which is disposed on a substrate and 
used for evaluating semiconductor layers epitaxially grown 
on the substrate. The present invention also relates to a method for 
evaluating an AlGaAs multiple quantum well layer and, more 
particularly to a method for evaluating the thickness and Al 
composition of the multiple quantum well layer with high 
precision. Figures 17(a) and 17(b) are perspective views for 
explaining a conventional method for measuring the thickness 
of a semiconductor layer epitaxially grown on a substrate. 
In these figures, reference numeral 101 designates a GaAs 
substrate and numeral 102 designates an epitaxial layer 
grown on the GaAs substrate 101. Initially, as illustrated in figure 17(a), an epitaxial 
layer 102 is grown on the GaAs substrate 101 having a  
 
diameter of 2 inches by MOCVD. The thickness of the 
epitaxial layer 102 is controlled by the growth time 
according to the growth rate obtained by the quantity of the 
supplied source gas. Thereafter, this wafer is cleaved to 
make a strip sample 103 shown in figure 17(b), and the 
section of the sample 103 is observed with a scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) and photographed, whereby the 
thickness of the epitaxial layer is obtained. In the conventional evaluation method, however, the 
cleaving of the wafer takes much time and labor. In 
addition, since the evaluation is performed after the growth 
of the epitaxial layer, a feedback cannot be applied during 
the epitaxial growth, so that the controllability of the 
thickness is poor, resulting in a poor production yield. Figure 18 is a schematic diagram illustrating a crystal 
growth monitor apparatus for optically measuring thickness 
of an epitaxial layer grown on a semiconductor substrate by 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This apparatus is disclosed 
in, for example, Japanese Published Patent Application No. 
Hei. 2-252694. In figure 18, a ultra-high vacuum container 111 having 
an observation window 112 contains a substrate holder 113 on 
which a substrate 114 is disposed. In the ultra-high vacuum 
container 111, molecular or atomic beam of materials, which 
is produced by evaporating material sources 115 and 116,  
 
reaches the substrate
