<CLAIMS>
Use of compounds of the general formula


and/or


in which

n denotes an integer between 2 and 6, preferably 2 and
3,
m denotes an integer between 1 and 6, preferably 1 to
3,
R denotes -C(CH
3
)
3
 and
X denotes hydrogen or


as core discolouration preventing agents in the
production of isocyanate-based foams. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterised in that
compounds (I) and/or (II) are utilised in a quantity

of from 0.01 to 0.5 wt.%, relative to the isocyanate-based
foam.
Use according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that
compounds (I) and/or (II) are utilised in a quantity

of from 0.1 to 0.4 wt-%, relative to the isocyanate-based
foam.
Use according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that


in which R denotes the same as previously indicated,

is utilised as compound (I).
Use according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that


in which R denotes the same as previously indicated,

is utilised as compound (II).
Use according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
further core discolouration preventing agents which

are known per se are co-used. 
Use according to Claim 7, characterised in that diaryl
amines are co-used.
Use of compounds (I) and/or (II) according to Claims 1
to 7 in the production of polyurethane foams.
Use of compounds (I) and/or (II) according to Claims 1
to 7 in the production of polyisocyanurate foams.
