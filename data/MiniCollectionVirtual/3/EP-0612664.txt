<ABSTRACT>
In a packaging for liquids, having tubular side walls (1), a bottom (2) and upper wall (3), all consisting of thermoformable plastic, the upper wall (3) has a pouring opening which can be closed by a lid and has an upright collar (9), and a seam (6) passing around the packaging in one plane is arranged in the upper end (3) in such a way that it is interrupted by a pouring opening and protrudes on diametrically opposite sides almost up to the free upper edge of the collar (9). In order to provide a packaging which can be opened easily, closed leaktightly, and can still be produced in an economic manner, provision is made according to the invention for the collar (9) to be composed of two collar halves which are connected at the seam (6), for threaded means (11) to be provided on the collar (9) in order to screw a threaded lid with a corresponding thread and a sealing surface onto the packaging, and for an annular, matching sealing surface to be formed on the free upper edge of the collar (9). A process and a device for thermoforming semishells to produce packages are also described.
