<ABSTRACT>
This process consists of supplying, to different rooms of an apartment, air at stable low pressure, with the aid of a fan (9) at relatively high pressure, of feeding the fan (9) on the one hand with the aid of new air (3, 4) and on the other hand with the aid of recycled air (12, 13), that is to say having been drawn by the fan (9) and not admitted into the apartment, and of adjusting the respective proportions of new air and recycled air, so that the proportion of new air increases and the proportion of recycled air decreases when the ventilation needs increase, and that the proportion of new air decreases and the proportion of recycled air increases when the ventilation needs decrease so that the flow rate of the fan is kept almost constant. Application to installations for controlled mechanical ventilation of apartments.

A method for supplying ventilation air to different rooms in premises comprising
providing the different rooms in the premises with air at a stable low pressure by means of a

relatively high pressure fan (9), feeding the fan (9) with both fresh air (3, 4) and recycled air
(12, 13), i.e. air driven by the fan (9) and not delivered to the premises, and adjusting the

respective proportions of fresh air and recycled air by simultaneously the cross-sections of
valves (4, 13) placed in an opening (3) delivering fresh air to the fan and a duct (12) for

recycling air varying in opposing fashion, in such a way that the proportion of fresh air
increases and the proportion of recycled air decreases as ventilation needs increase, and the

proportion of fresh air decreases and the proportion of recycled air increases as ventilation
needs decrease, so that the output of the fan is held virtually constant.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises adjusting the
proportions of fresh air and recycled air by controlling the pressure difference (P1, P4)

obtaining upstream of the fan (9) in a zone subjected to the effects of the recycled air and fresh
air, and downstream from the fan in a zone located upstream from the ducts feeding air to the

different rooms in the premises respectively.
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that the pressure difference (P1)
upstream of the fan and (P4) upstream of the delivery ducts to the different rooms is defined

with respect to a reference pressure.
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the reference pressure is obtained
by mixing the pressures of the fresh air (Pe) outside the premises and the air (Pi) inside the

premises respectively.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that the reference pressure is obtained
by mixing 0.5 to 0.15 times the pressure of the fresh air (Pe) and 0.5 to 0.85 times the pressure

of the air within the premises (Pi), the mixing proportion being fixed. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that it comprises
arranging the components causing a loss of head (7, 8) upstream and downstream of the fan

(9) to obtain balanced pressures at the fan and to lower the pressure of the air supplied to the
delivery ducts to the rooms in the premises with respect to the pressure provided by the fan.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the operating pressure of the fan is
fixed within a range from 80 to 160 Pa.
A method according to claim 6, characterised in that the low pressure (P4) supplied to
the delivery ducts to the rooms in the premises is fixed within a range from 5 to 40 Pa.
A method according to claim 6, characterised in that the pressure (P2, P3) of the air on
either side of the fan (9) and between the latter and the components causing a loss of head (7,

8) is fixed within a range from 50 to 80 Pa.
A device for implementing the method according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that it comprises a chest (2) having a fresh air inlet duct (3) which

communicates with the outside and is equipped with a valve (4), air delivery ducts (5)
connected to the ducts feeding air to the premises, this chest being equipped with a fan (9), a

recycling duct (12) which returns part of the air from the zone including the outlet ducts (5) to
the zone including the fresh air inlet and is provided with an adjustment valve (13) whose

cross-section is activated synchronously with and inversely to the fresh air inlet valve (4),
maintaining the flow delivered to the fan constant.
A device according to claim 10, characterised in that two chambers which are bounded
in the case of the upstream chamber by a filter (7) and in the case of the one downstream by a

reduction in cross-section (8) which produces substantially the same loss of head as the filter
are provided upstream and downstream from the fan (9).
A device according to claim 11, characterised in that the cross-section reducing member
(8) located downstream of the filter (7) has a cross-section which is equal to the equivalent

cross-section of the filter itself less half the change in equivalent cross-section of the filter
when it is becoming clogged up.
A device according to either of claims 11 and 12, characterised in that the filter is a
wound filter (17), in which the renewing movement is initiated by exceeding a specified 

pressure difference between the relative pressures (P
i
 - P
2
) and (P
3
 - P
i
) obtaining immediately
upstream and downstream of the fan.
A device according to claim 13, characterised in that the drive for the movement
renewing the filter (17) is obtained without additional energy by making use of the pressure

differences upstream and downstream of the fan.
A device according to any one of claims 10 to 14, characterised in that the valves
located in the fresh air inlet and in the recycling duct comprise a single valve (16) in the form

of a three way mixer valve.
