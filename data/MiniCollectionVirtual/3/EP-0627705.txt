<ABSTRACT>
An optical code reader which is held in a hand of 
an operator and is brought near to an article having a 

2-dimensional code affixed thereto at the time of 
reading, includes an illumination light source (29) for 

illuminating the 2-dimensional code on the article, a 
reading unit (30, 23, 32, 31) for reading the 

2-dimensional code from a light reflected by the 
article, and a frame (21) for housing the light source (29) 

and the reading unit (30,23,32,31), having a read window (22) through 
which the reflected light passes. The reading unit (30,23,32,31) has 

an area CCD (32) for sensing an image corresponding to 
the reflected light and converting the image to an electrical 

signal, and a lens block (23) for focusing the 
reflected light to the area CCD (32) to form the image. 

Particularly, the reading unit further has an optical 
path length adjusting cap (22a) for adjusting the length 

of an optical path between the read window (22) and the lens 
block (23) upon change in the magnification of the lens 

block (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical code
reader for reading a 2-dimensional code affixed to an
article and, more particularly, to an optical code
reader which is held in a hand of an operator at the
time of reading.In many supermarkets, article codes expressed in
the form of bar codes are used for sales registration.
FIG. 1A shows a bar code which is printed on the label
of an article in advance and is read by a bar code scanner
in sales registration. The bar code scanner detects
an image of the bar code printed on the label of the
article, and performs a read processing to obtain an
article code from the detected image. This article code
is supplied to an electronic cash register via a cable.
The electronic cash register then performs a sales
registration processing on the basis of the article code
supplied from the bar code scanner.FIG. 2A shows a touch type bar code scanner. In a
bar code read operation, an operator holds the bar code
scanner in his/her hand, and brings a read window 1A
formed on the distal end of the bar code scanner into
contact with the label of an article. In this state,
the operator depresses a read switch 1B. This scanner
has an LED light source and a line CCD inside the read
window. These components operate together upon an
operation of the read switch 1B. The LED light source 
illuminates the entire label. The line CCD then
receives light reflected by a bar code printed on the
label and detects a bar code image corresponding to the
light. An LED indicator 1C is turned on when an article
code is properly obtained from the bar code image
detected by the line CCD, thus informing the operator of
the completion of reading a code.FIG. 2B shows a gun type bar code scanner. In a
bar code read operation, an operator holds the bar code
scanner in his/her hand, and directs a read window 2A
formed on an upper portion of the bar code scanner to
the label of an article. In this state, the operator
depresses a read switch 2B. This scanner has a laser
source and a line CCD inside the read window. These
components operate together upon an operation of the
read switch 2B. The laser source scans the label in one
direction with a laser beam. The line CCD then receives
light reflected by a bar code printed on the label and
detects a bar code image corresponding to the light.FIG. 2C shows a stationary type bar code scanner.
In a bar code read operation, an operator holds an
article in his/her hand, and directs the label of the
article to a read window 3A of the bar code scanner
fixed in
