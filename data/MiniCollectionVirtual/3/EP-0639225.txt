<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polypeptides and peptides, particularly recombinant
polypeptides, which can be useful in the field of tumor therapy, inflammation or
immunology.The invention also relates to a process for preparing the above-said
polypeptides and peptides.It also relates to nucleic acids coding for said polypeptides and peptides.Monocytes/macrophages are cells of great complexity accomplishing a
multitude of different functions related to (i) responses to environmental challenges
such as phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, (ii) enzyme production.
(iii) to differentiation, (iv) to regulatory responses by the synthesis of macrophage-specific
cytokines which function as metabolic or immunological regulatory
proteins and (v) by the production of complement components, coagulation factors,
enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, and oxygen radicals (reviewed by Adams and
Hamilton (1984).Several macrophage-derived cytokines have already been described:
interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), colony
stimulating factor (CSF), interferon (IFN), macrophage inflammatory protein
(MIP), and monocytic-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF or IL-8)
(Old, 1985; Durum et al., 1986; Quesenberry, 1986; Billiau, 1987; Yoshimura et
al., 1987; Davatelis et al., 1988; Kishimoto and Hirano, 1988;). In most instances,
the production of these cytokines by the macrophages requires exposure to one or
more signals present in the immediate microenvironment of the cells. These signals
may consist of particulate matter which can be opsonized, invading parasites,
bacterial infectants, or antibody-covered antigens (Unanue, (1989)). They
invariably lead to a state of enhanced competence of the macrophage (termed
activation), ultimately giving rise to the synthesis of some of the above-mentioned
macrophage-specific cytokines (monokines).A particular set of genes (some of which are specifically expressed by
macrophages, hereafter termed monokine genes) may correspond to each individual
activation process. Such genes can either be up- or down-regulated.
Characterization of some of these genes is possible by measuring their 
corresponding biological function with appropriate bioassays (Ruff and Gifford.
1986; Van Snick et al., 1986; Van Damme et al., 1987), or using differential
hybridization with cDNAs derived from either activated or nonactivated
macrophages. This can result in the isolation of cDNAs that correspond to genes
switched on during the process of differentiation of resting
