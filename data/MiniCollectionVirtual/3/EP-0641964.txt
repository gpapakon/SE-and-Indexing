<ABSTRACT>
The device includes two parallel longitudinal members (10) and elements (12) for connecting these longitudinal members. The longitudinal members are formed of sections having a web (14) and a flange (18) which extends from one edge of the web, substantially perpendicularly to it. The flange includes, on its internal face (20), on the web side, a longitudinal rib (24) and the connecting elements (12, 52) at their ends include means (30, 56) for interlocking with the said rib, and a locking piece (42, 58) is inserted, pressed against the web (14), between the end (28, 54) of the connecting elements and a projection (16) of the longitudinal member extending substantially parallel to the flange, in order to press this end against the said flange. The invention applies to the production of cable risers or cable trunking for supporting electrical cables or other pipes.

Device for supporting cables or conduits, having 
two parallel longitudinal members (10), formed by 

profiled elements having a web (14) and a flange 
(18) which extends from the edge of the web, 

substantially perpendicularly thereto, elements (12, 
52) for connecting these longitudinal members 

together, and locking pieces for locking the said 
connecting elements on the longitudinal members, the 

flange having on its internal face (20), on the same 
side as the web, a longitudinal rib (24), and the 

connecting elements (12, 52) having, towards their 
ends, means (30, 56) of nesting on the said rib, 

characterised in that each of the said locking 
pieces (42, 58) is inserted, whilst being applied 

against the web (14), between the end (28, 54) of 
the connecting elements and a projection (16) on the 

longitudinal member extending substantially parallel 
to the web, in order to press this end against the 

said flange. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the connecting elements are formed by steps 

(12) disposed perpendicularly to the longitudinal 
members (10), and spaced apart from each other. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the connecting elements consist of one or more 

plates (52). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the projection on the longitudinal member 

consists of a second flange (16) thereon. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in  
 

that the two flanges (16, 18) are symmetrical with 
respect to a longitudinal mid-plane of the 

longitudinal member. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the means of nesting on the 

connecting elements consist of a groove (30) with a 
shape complementary to that of the rib (24) on the 

longitudinal members. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the distance (d) between the rib (24) and the 

flange (14) on the longitudinal member is 
substantially equal to the distance (d1) between the 

groove (30) and the ends of the connecting elements 
(12). 
Device according to one of Claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that the locking pieces (42) have a 

thickness substantially equal to the distance (d) 
between the rib (24) and the flange (14) on the 

longitudinal members. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the steps (12) consist of solid or tubular 

profiled elements. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the steps consist of profiled elements with a 

cross section in the form of a "C" having a 
substantially flat base (32), two flanges (36) and 

two flange returns (38) substantially parallel to 
the base and forming between them a longitudinal 

channel (40). 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the groove (30) is produced in the wall (32)  

 
forming the base of the "C", and the locking pieces 

(42) are in abutment against the flange returns 
(38). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the locking pieces (42) have a protrusion (48) 

engaged without clearance in the channel (40).
