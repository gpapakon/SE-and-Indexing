<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a solution or dispersion of a 
staurosporine active ingredient in a saturated polyalkylene glycol glyceride such as 

a mixture of esters of C₈-C₁₈ saturated fatty acids with glycerol and polyethylene 
glycol. The composition may be administered in capsules or as a dispersion in an 

aqueous medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, particularly pharmaceutical
compositions comprising a staurosporine as active ingredient.US Patent 5 093 330 describes staurosporine and N-substituted derivatives thereof as
pharmaceuticals for use in tumour inhibition and inflammation inhibition, for antibacterial
use and for use in combating arteriosclerosis, diseases of the cardiovascular system and of
the central nervous system.Many staurosporines have low solubility in water. For example, N-benzoylstaurosporine,
an especially preferred compound, has a solubility of less than 01.mg/litre. The
staurosporines have been found to have low or negligible bioavailability.The formulation of an orally administrable preparation has proved problematic since
formulation with materials which are conventionally used to improve bioavailability,
including materials in which the staurosporines are soluble, has negligible or no effect on
bioavailability.It has now been found that by dispersing a staurosporine active ingredient in a saturated
polyglycolysed glyceride, i.e. a polyalkylene glycol-modified saturated fatty acid
glyceride, bioavailability can be considerably increased and orally administrable
formulations can be prepared.Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
solution or dispersion of a staurosporine active ingredient in a saturated polyalkylene
glycol glyceride.The staurosporine active ingredient may be any of those described in US Patent No.
5093330. Preferred compounds are N-acylstaurosporines including
N-benzoylstaurosporine, N-(3-nitrobenzoyl)staurosporine,
N-(3-fluorobenzoyl)staurosporine, N-trifluoracetylstaurosporine, 
N-phenylcarbamoylstaurosporine, N-(3-carboxypropionyl)staurosporine,
N-methylaminothiocarbonylstaurosporine, N-tert-butoxycarbonylstaurosporine,
N-(4-carboxybenzoyl)staurosporine, N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)staurosporine,
N-(2-aminoacetyl)staurosporine, N-alanylstaurosporine and their pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. An especially preferred active ingredient is N-benzoylstaurosporine.The saturated polyalkylene glycol glyceride may be, for example, a mixture of glyceryl
and polyethylene glycol esters of one or more long chain saturated fatty acids, usually
C8-C18 saturated fatty acids. The acid component of such esters may be, for example,
caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid or a mixture
of two or more thereof. The polyethylene glycol component of such esters generally has a
molecular
