<ABSTRACT>
In a rolling mill for rolling aluminium strip, it is desirable to apply water to the rolls on the entry side of the mill. Water should be kept off the surface of the rolled strip (S) to avoid marking and, to this end, a moisture extraction device is arranged to collect moisture passing between the upper work roll (1) and its back-up roll (5). The device includes an extractor system connected to a head assembly (7) located in the cusp between the work roll (1) and its back-up roll (5) on the exit side of the mill.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO ROLLING MILLSThis invention relates to rolling mills and in particular to rolling mills for cold rolling aluminium strip.The final rolling stages of aluminium strip consist of rolling the strip through a number of rolling mill stands, sometimes arranged in tandem, so that the strip leaving the last stand is of the required gauge. This strip is then coiled for subsequent use. The rolls of the mill stands are cooled by having liquid coolant applied to them on the entry side and it has been the practice to employ kerosene as the liquid coolant. However, for various reasons, it would be preferable to use water as the liquid coolant, but it is absolutely vital to keep water off the strip on the exit side of the mill when it is coiled because water left on the surface of the coiled strip dries and causes considerable staining of the strip rendering it unacceptable to many potential users.Each of the mill stands consists of a pair of work rolls arranged one above the other and each work roll is backed up by a separate back-up roll. The liquid coolant is applied to both the work rolls and 

 the back-up rolls on the entry side of the mill stands and steps are usually taken to contain the liquid coolant on the entry side of the stand and to limit, as far as possible, the movement of the liquid coolant to the surfaces of the rolls at the exit side of the stands in order to prevent moisture being deposited on the strip and which may eventually cause staining of the strip.In practice, it has been found that moisture may penetrate between the upper work roll and its backÂ¬ up roll and collect in the cusp at the exit side of the mill between the upper work roll and its back-up roll. Furthermore, even if the liquid coolant applied to the back-up roll on the entry side is contained within a chamber which is sealed along its length to the periphery of the back-up roll, there may be some leakage through the seal between the chamber and the upper back-up roll and this permits some moisture to collect on the periphery of the upper back-up roll and be taken to the cusp between this roll and its work roll on the exit side.It is an object of the present invention to provide a moisture extraction device for such a rolling mill by which moisture which collects at this cusp can be removed. 

 According to the present invention, for use with a rolling mill having a pair of work rolls each backed-up with the back-up roll, a moisture extraction means is characterised in that it comprises a head assembly

<CLAIMS>
Claims :
1. For use with a rolling mill having a pair of work rolls each backed-up with the back-up roll, a moisture extraction means, characterised in that it comprises a head assembly shaped to enter into and extend along the length of the cusp between the upper work roll and its back-up roll on the exit side of the mill; an extractor system connected to the head assembly and including suction generating means by which, in use, air is sucked from the cusp through the head assembly into the extractor system whereby moisture present in the cusp is drawn with the air into the extractor system.
2. Moisture extraction means as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the head assembly includes an elongate backing plate which extends for the length of the cusp between the rolls, and shaped pieces at the ends of the backing plate which extend into the cusp and are positioned closely between the rolls, and at least one tube communicating with the space between the end pieces and a union on the opposite side of the backing plate. 


3. Moisture extraction means as claimed in claim
2, characterised in that the extractor system includes ducting which connects the or each union on the head assembly with the suction generating means and the ducting includes quick release joints at its connections to the or each union and the suction generating means.
4. Moisture extraction means as claimed in claim
3, characterised in that there are a plurality of unions on the head assembly and means are provided for operating all the quick release joints simultaneously.
5. Moisture extraction means as claimed in claim
4, characterised in that all the ducting is mounted on a movable support plate amd means are provided for displacing the support plate and the ducting between a first position in which the connections between the ducting and the unions and the suction generating means are made and a second position in which the connections are broken. 


 6. Moisture extraction means as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in that nozzles are located on the head assembly at the ends thereof, said nozzles being directed inwardly of the end pieces towards the central region of the head assembly and means for supplying air under pressure to the nozzles.
7. A rolling mill having a pair of work rolls, a pair of back-up rolls and the cusp between the upper work roll and its back-up roll on the exit side of the mill being provided with moisture extraction means as claimed in any of the preceding claims.
