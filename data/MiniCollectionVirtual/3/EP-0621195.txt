<ABSTRACT>
The invention, relating to an easy-open metal container 
end, places a portion of the metal of the tear panel (12), 

in the region where a score stop otherwise would be located, 
under compression by forming a short coined depression or 

bead (40) in the tear panel, preferably in the public side, 
close to the score line (15) at least at the end of the vent 

region (35) opposite from the inner hook (16), which is 
located at the radially inward end of the tear panel score 

line. During initial opening or venting action, as the 
rivet (25) is lifted by initial tab motion, separation 

proceeds along the score line, beneath the nose (28) of the 
tab (27). The metal adjacent and in this coined depression 

tends to move partially underneath the metal on the opposite 
side of the score line from the coined vent bead. This 

action provides sufficient disruption or retarding of the 
score line separation or rupture, during venting, to confine 

such separation to the vent region until internal pressure 
is vented. Further separation of the tear panel can proceed 

under control of continued raising tab motion and resulting 
opening force. By providing such a coined vent bead, the 

score stop may be made considerable less deep leaving 
adequate residual metal along score line (15), or the score 

stop can be entirely eliminated in some cases, thereby 
making it possible to achieve consistent and proper venting 

in ends made of thinner metals, e.g. in the order of 0.009--0.008 
inch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an easy-open can end for a container according to the
preamble of claim 1 and further to a method for controlling venting the thin metal end panel in an
easy-open can end for a container according to the preamble of claim 12. Such easy-open ends
are particularly used for beverage cans and the like which are internally pressurized. Specifically,
the invention relates to an improved construction for venting or releasing the pressure internal of
the container during the initial operation of the easy-open mechanism of the end, particularly such
a construction which is applicable to ends made of thinner metal material.An easy-open can end and a method of venting the same is known from US-patent
5,064,087. The features of the preambles of claims 1 and 12 of the accompanying set of claims
are known from this document. Further, the panel of this can end comprises bead portions
extending parallel to and adjacent a major portion of the score line outside of the tear panel.
These beads are intended to serve as means for improving the strength in order to provide a
greater resistance to a distortion.From EP-0 564 725-A1 which was published only after the priority date of the present
invention, thus forming a document according to article 54 (3) EPC, there is known a depression
in the tear panel adjacent the score line and immediately below the nose portion of a tab. This
recessed portion or depression is only designed to receive the nose portion once the tab is lifted
for opening in order to facilitate the initial lifting movement. However, the bead portion is not
designed and arranged to stop or limit the initial rupture of the score line.The mechanism of venting in an easy-open container end is per se known, for example
as described in U.S. Patents 4,015,744 of 5 April 1977 and 4,030,631 of 21 June 1977 which are
assigned to the assignee of this application. The easy-open mechanism includes an end panel
which is attached to the container, a tear panel defined in the end panel by a score line, an
operating tab including a nose which extends partially over the tear panel, and an integral rivet
connecting the tab to the end panel and defining a pivot point for tab operation. Basically, initial
lifting of the tab produces an upward force on the rivet and a downward force on an edge of the
tear panel, preferably adjacent a beginning point of the tear panel score line. This in turn causes
an initial opening of the tear panel beneath the nose of the tab, a limited expansion of that
ope

(12) defined within a score line (15) formed in the end panel, the tear panel (12) being

separable from the end panel (10) along the score line (15), an operating tab (27) having
a nose (28) and a handle (30), an integral rivet (25) adjacent the score line (15) and

attaching the operating tab (27) to the end panel (10) on the opposite side of the score
line from the tear panel such that the nose (28) of the operating tab extends over a portion

of the tear panel (12) by which to separate the tear panel from the end panel along the
score line (15), a part of the score line (15) in the vicinity of said rivet (25) forming a vent

region (35) responsive to lifting of the rivet by the tab (27), for causing initial venting of
said container to occur by separation of the tear panel (12), said vent region (35) being

defined by an inner end (16) of said score line located in the vicinity of said rivet (25) and
a location (36) along said score line (15) spaced from said inner end where said score line

has a curve from whence the score line proceeds in a loop about the tear panel (12),
characterised by a portion of the metal (48) in the tear panel (12) immediately adjacent

the score line (15) in the vicinity of said rivet (25) between said inner end (16) and said
location (36) of said score line (15) being coined toward and close to the score line
