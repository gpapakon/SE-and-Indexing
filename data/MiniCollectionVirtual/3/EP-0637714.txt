<ABSTRACT>
A safety mechanism for a mobile rack storage 
system (10,12) has a sensor probe or trip bar (20) 

which is moveable between a first operative positon, 
whilst the mobile rack (10,12) is in motion, to a 

second, inoperative, position, whilst the mobile 
rack (10,12) is stationary. In the first position the 

proble (20) is able to sense the presence of an object 
obstructing movement of the mobile rack (10,12). In the 

second position the probe (20) is retracted into a 
protected position and the sensor probe is not able to 

sense an obstructing obstacle. A solenoid assembly (24) 
drives the probe (20) between the first and second 

positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to safety 
mechanisms for mobile units. It has particular 
application to mobile storage rack units, and will be 
described herein with reference thereto. However, the 
invention may find further application wherever a unit 
is being driven under power in situations in which a 
person or an obstacle might find itself in the path of 
the mobile unit. Mobile storage rack units are typically used where 
there is a requirement for large and versatile storage 
capacity within a small space. In a typical 
installation, a multiplicity of mobile storage rack 
units are arranged for movement on a common track in a 
supporting floor. The units may be moved under power 
along the track to create an aisle between two adjacent 
units along which stock may be loaded into or removed 
from the units, the remaining units typically being 
brought into close proximity to one another so 
minimising the space that they occupy. Clearly, it is most desirable in practical terms 
essential that such units are provided with safety 
devices to halt their movement in the event that they 
collide with an object or person in their path. Conventionally, each unit is provided with one or 
more trip mechanisms. Each trip mechanism typically 
comprises an elongate bar extending perpendicular to 
the direction of movement of the unit substantially 
along the length of the unit, and close to and parallel 
to the floor. The bar is arranged, in its normal 
position, to project from the unit in a direction of 
movement thereof. The bar is typically arranged such  
 
that on application thereto of a force directed towards 
the unit, it may move towards the unit, such movement 
causing actuation of detection means, such as a switch, 
operative to cause movement of the unit to be halted. 
An example of such a known trip mechanism is disclosed 
in GB 1 469 293. The reader is directed to read 
GB 1 469 293 to see the sort of shelf racking storage 
system to which the present invention is especially 
applicable. It has been found that conventional trip 
mechanisms may be prone to damage, at least partly 
because in their normal position a portion of each bar 
projects from the unit making it vulnerable to 
collision from moving equipment used to load and unload 
the units. A single collision may cause significant 
damage, rendering the unit inoperable, so effectively 
making much stock inaccessible, and necessitating a 
costly repair. Whilst one or more units are inoperable, 
the mobile rack storage system itself may

<CLAIMS>
A safety mechanism for a mobile article (10, 12), 

the safety mechanism having a sensor probe (20) which 
has a first, operative, condition in which it is 

operative to sense the presence of an obstruction in a 
hazard zone adjacent the mobile article (10, 12), and a 

second, inoperative, condition in which it is more 
protected from damage than it is when it is in its 

first condition. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 in which the 
sensor probe (20) is in its inoperative condition when 

it is in a retracted position. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 or claim 2 in 
which the probe (20) is a contact probe. 
A mechanism according to any preceding claim in 
which the mechanism has drive means (22, 24) adapted to 

move the sensor probe (20) between the operative and 
inoperative positions. 
A mechanism according to any preceding claim in 
which the probe (20) is withdrawn at substantially all 

times that the article (10, 12) is not moving, about to 
move, or just stopped moving, and at times when the 

probe (20) is vulnerable. 
A mechanism according to any preceding claim in 
which the sensor probe (20) is arranged to occupy such 

a position with respect to a protective member (26) of 
the unit that the protective member (26) protects the 

probe (20) from impacts. 
A mobile rack storage system in which a mobile 
rack (10, 12), comprising a mobile article, is provided 

with a safety mechanism in accordance with any 
preceding claim. 
A method of operating a safety trip mechanism for 
a mobile unit (10, 12) comprising the steps of moving a 

probe (20) of the mechanism to an operative position 
prior to, or on, movement of the unit (10, 12), 

monitoring the probe (20) for actuation of the 
probe (20) in response to the presence of an obstacle 

during movement of the unit (10, 12), and stopping 
movement of the unit (10, 12) in response to actuation 

of the probe (20). 
A method according to claim 8 comprising the step 
of moving the probe (20) to a withdrawn position after 

movement of the unit (10, 12) has stopped, or after 
power to move the unit (10, 12) has been stopped. 
A kit for fitting to a mobile rack storage system, 
the kit comprising drive means (22, 24) adapted to move 

a trip bar or other sensor probe (20) of the 
system (10, 12) to an advanced or retracted position, 

and control means adapted to control the operation of 
the drive means (22, 24) so as to put the trip bar (20) 

in a projecting position when the rack to which it is 
fitted in use is moving.
