<ABSTRACT>
In a digital copier system wherein a plurality of 
applications share resources, when two or more applications 

generate requests for using an image forming device, they are 
allowed to use it in a particular order matching a 

predetermined priority order. Hence, only if the user gives a 
desired priority order to the applications beforehand, the 

system can be conveniently used even when a plurality of 
applications share the image forming device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital copier system
of the type converting a document image to an electric signal
and reproducing it by an image forming device and, more
particularly, to a digital copier system wherein a plurality of
applications share resources.Generally, a digital copier of the type described
transforms a document image to an electric signal, executes
various kinds of image processing with the electric signal, or
image signal, and then causes an image forming device to
reproduce the document image represented by the processed
image signal. This type of copier can be provided with
various kinds of applications, e.g., facsimile application,
printer application, scanner application, and file system
application. Then, the applications will share resources
available in the copier, e.g., image reading device, image
forming device, operation and display panel, memory, and
peripheral units. The peripheral units include a document
feeder and a sorter. However, the problem with the digital copier described
above is that it is implemented as a single task system
wherein a plurality of applications share the resources. This
kind of system prevents a plurality of users to use the
applications at the same time. For example, when a person is
operating the copier to produce copies, another person cannot
use the printer application unless the person waits until the
copying operation has been completed or interrupted. While
only the printer application is in use, facsimile transmission
using the facsimile application cannot be effected until the
printer output has been completed or interrupted, despite that
the facsimile application is capable of sending facsimile data
by using only the image reading device.In light of this, there has been proposed a multitask
type digital copier system which allows the copier, printer,
facsimile and other applications to share and selectively use
the image reading device, image forming device and other
resources.However, the conventional digital copier system of the
type described has the following problem. Assume that a
plurality of applications share the image forming device.
Then, when one application occupies the image forming device
over a long period of time, the other applications cannot use
it. This is undesirable from the convenience standpoint. EP-A-0410668 discloses a multi-function digital
copier system of the above type which is in accordance
with the precharacterising portion of claim 1. It
operates a job queuing mode in which fax, copy and print
job

<CLAIMS>
A digital copier system comprising:

a plurality of applications (8), including a copier
application (81), a printer application (82) and a

facsimile application (83), which share and selectively
use resources including an image forming device (4) to

perform jobs assigned to the applications, and a system
controller (101) for controlling the system such that

when two or more of said applications generate requests
for using said a particular one of said resources, an

order in which said two or more applications use the
particular resource is determined on the basis of a

predetermined priority order, characterised in that the
system is operable in an interleaving mode in which the

execution by said particular resource of a job for one of
said two or more applications (8) is interleaved into the

execution of a job for another of said two or more
applications, and wherein when two or more of said

applications (8) having a same degree of priority
generate requests for the use of said images forming

device (4), the use of the image forming device is given
on an alternate sheet-by-sheet basis to the two

applications, and in a mode wherein said applications use
different ones of said resources simultaneously.
A digital copier system comprising:

a plurality of applications (8), including a copier
app
lication (81), a printer application (82) and a
facsimile application (83), which share and selectively

use resources including an image forming device (4) to
perform jobs assigned to the applications, and a system

controller (101) for controlling the system such that
when two or more of said applications generate requests

for using said a particular one of said resources, an 
order in which said two or more applications use the

particular resource is determined on the basis of a
predetermined priority order, characterised in that the

system is operable in an interleaving mode in which the
execution by said particular resource of a job for one of

said two or more applications (8) is interleaved into the
execution of a job for another of said two or more

applications, and in a mode wherein said applications use
different ones of said resources simultaneously, and in

that said predetermined priority order is
settable as desired by the user.
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said
plurality of applications (8) are each capable of

selecting a particular writing density available with
said image forming device (4), said system first giving,

when two or more of said applications (8) generate the
requests, priority to one application whose writing speed

is desired most often.
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
resources further comprise:


an image reading device (3) for reading an image to
be printed by the image forming device (4).
A system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
resources further comprise:


an operation panel (2) for displaying a status of an
application which is currently using the operation panel

(2) and for selectively displaying the image associated
with that application.
