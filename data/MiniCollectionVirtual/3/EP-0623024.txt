<ABSTRACT>
Compositions comprising lanthionine-containing bacteriocins such as nisin act as bactericides under conditions such as those found in the gastrointestinal tract. In a preferred embodiment pharmaceutical preparations containing the compositions are used for the control of bacteria responsible for disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various gastrointestinal diseases or symptoms 
including diarrhea, gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcer, 
and gastric carcinoma are due to the presence of 
pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Escherichia and Salmonella, in particular, but also 
certain species of Clostridia, Bacillus, Bacteroides, 
Campylobacter and Yersinia can be responsible for 
diarrhea especially in neonatal farm animals. (R.E. 
Holland, 1990, Clin.Microbiol.Rev. 3:345, "Some 
infectious causes of diarrhea in young farm animals.") 
Helicobacterpylori are implicated in gastritis, duodenal 
and peptic ulcer disease. (Peterson, W.L., 1991, 
NewEng.J.Med. 324: 1043, "Helicobacter pylori and peptic 
ulcer disease") and are also associated with gastric 
carcinoma. (Henderson, B.E., Ross, R.K., and Pike, M.C., 
1991, Science 254:1131, "Toward the primary prevention of 
cancer," Nomura, A. Stemmermann, G.A., Chyou, P.H., 
Kato,I., Perez-Perez, G. and Blaser, M.J. (1991) NewEng.J.Med. 
325: 1132 "Helicobacterpylori infection and 
gastric carcinoma among Japanese Americans in Hawaii."; 
Parsonnet, J., Friedman, G.D., Vandersteen, D.P., Chang, 
Y., Vogelman, J.H., Orentreich,N, and Sibley, R.K. (1991) 
NewEng.J.Med. 325:1127; Forman, D., Sitas, F., Newell, 
D.G., Stacey, A.R., Boreham, J., Peto, R., Campbell, 
T.C., Li, J. and Chen, J. (1990) Int.J.Cancer 46:608 
"Geographic association of Helicobacterpylori antibody 
prevalence and gastric cancer mortality in rural China"). Many gastrointestinal pathogens are gram negative 
bacteria. 
For example, 
Helicobacterpylori (which has also been identified in the prior art 
as Campylobacterpylori) is a gram negative 
microaerophilic bacillus that colonizes the gastric 
mucosa. Since 1983, when first reported in association 
with histologic gastritis, a relationship between 
suppression of H.pylori infection and improvement of  
 
gastric disorders has been noted. However, although 
numerous antibiotics have been tried against H.pylori 
infection, none have so far proved acceptable and no 
agent or regimen has been approved for use against this 
organism. Long term eradication of the organism has 
seldom been achieved and antibiotics themselves can 
produce unacceptable side effects. (Peterson, W.L., 
1991, NewEng.J.Med. 324:1043 "Helicobacterpylori and 
peptic ulcer disease; Warren, J.R., 1983, Lancet 1:1273,

active chronic gastritis"; Morgan et al., 1988,
