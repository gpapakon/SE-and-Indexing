<CLAIMS>
Tablet with improved bioavailability of the active
ingredient clodronic acid or a physiologically

acceptable salt thereof, a content of 5 - 15% (based
on the total weight of the tablet) of

microcrystalline cellulose as a pharmaceutical
adjunct, and a content of clodronic acid active

ingredient of 200 - 700 mg.
Tablet according to Claim 1 with a microcrystalline
cellulose content of 8 - 12%.
Tablet according to Claim 1 or 2 containing the
active ingredient in the form of the disodium salt,

preferably in the form of the tetrahydrate.
Tablet according to Claims 1 - 3 additionally
containing a filler, especially maize starch or

talcum.
Tablet according to Claims 1 - 4 additionally
containing a lubricant and a disintegrating agent.
Tablet according to Claim 5 wherein the lubricant a
physiologically acceptable salt of stearic acid,

preferably magnesium stearate, and the disintegrating
agent sodium carboxymethyl starch.
Tablet according to Claims 1 - 6 with a clodronic
acid active ingredient content of 420 - 460 mg and a

total tablet weight of 750 - 850 mg, preferably of
790 - 810 mg. 
Tablet according to Claims 1 - 6 with a clodronic

acid active ingredient content of 500 - 530 mg and a
total tablet weight of 870 - 970 mg, preferably of

900 - 950 mg.
Tablet according to Claims 1 - 6 with a clodronic
acid active ingredient content of about 200 - 270 mg

and a total tablet weight of 350 - 500 mg.
Drug pack containing 30 - 400 tablets according to
Claim 7 or 8 for administration in a daily dose of

one to three tablets, preferably of two tablets.
Drug pack containing 30 - 400 tablets according to
Claim 9 for administration in a daily dose of four to

eight tablets, preferably of four tablets.
Use of microcrystalline cellulose in an amount of 5 -
15% (based on the total weight of the tablet) as a

pharmaceutical adjunct for increasing the
bioavailability of the active ingredient clodronic

acid or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof in
the production of tablets.
Process for the production of a tablet according to
Claims 1 - 9, 
characterized in that
 the active
ingredient is mixed together with microcrystalline

cellulose and optionally other pharmaceutical
adjuncts or excipients, by methods known per se, and

compressed to tablets.
Process according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that

the active ingredient is mixed with approx. 
4 - 8 wt.% of fillers and granulated with a

conventional binder, 5 - 15 wt.% of microcrystalline
cellulose, up to 3 wt.% of disintegrating agent and

up to 6 wt.% of lubricant are admixed to the
resulting granules in a conventional mixing

apparatus, the granules are converted to tablets
after the mixing process and the tablet core obtained

is optionally provided with a coating to improve the
taste or to delay the release of the active

ingredient.
Process according to Claim 14, 
characterized in that

the active ingredient is granulated with 6 - 7 wt.%
of fillers, and 8 - 12 wt.% of microcrystalline

cellulose, up to 2 wt.% of disintegrating agent and
up to 3 wt.% of lubricant are admixed to the

granules.
Process according to Claim 14 or 15, 
characterized in
that
 the fillers used are maize starch and/or talcum.
Process according to one of Claims 14 - 16,

characterized in that
 the lubricant used is magnesium
stearate and the disintegrating agent used is sodium

carboxymethyl starch.
