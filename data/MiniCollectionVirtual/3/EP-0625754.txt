<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for allocation of hardware resources of a 
computer system to an add-on sub-system. The mechanism 

includes means for automatically checking whether the 
hardware resources required by the sub-system are available 

within the computer system. If the required hardware 
resources are not available, alternative hardware resources 

are automatically allocated to the sub-system, and a report 
is generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to computer systems and more 
particularly is concerned with allocation of the hardware 
resources of such a system to add-on sub-systems. These 
hardware resources may include, for example, interrupt 
vectors, DMA channels, I/O address ranges and memory address 
ranges. The add-on sub-systems may, for example, be add-on 
modules such as LAN or bus interface cards and their 
associated driver software modules. Resource allocation causes problems of administration and 
control: how to ensure that any given set of add-on 
sub-systems are assigned appropriate hardware resources. 
Conventionally, resource allocation is the responsibility of 
the user when installing a new sub-system. If there is a 
clash of resource usage, the user must draw up tables showing 
what resources have already been allocated to existing 
installed sub-systems and then choose an alternative resource 
which is both unused and useable by the new sub-system 
hardware and software. A problem with this is that it requires expert system 
administration, and is susceptible to human error. The 
object of the present invention is to overcome or reduce 
these problems. According to the invention there is provided a computer 
system comprising means for installing a sub-system, 
including means for automatically checking whether hardware 
resources required by the sub-system are available within the  
 
computer system and, if required hardware resources are not 
available, for automatically allocating alternative hardware 
resources to the sub-system. As will be shown, the invention overcomes the above-mentioned 
problems by automating the choice of alternative resources. 
This technique is referred to herein as dynamic resource 
allocation (DRA). Figure 1 is a block diagram of a computer system embodying 
the invention. Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram showing the mechanism 
for installing a sub-system. One computer system embodying the invention will now be 
described by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 1, the computer system comprises a 
processing unit 10 having a main memory 11. The processing 
unit 10 is connected to an I/O (input/output) bus 12, which 
is in turn connected to a number of units including a user 
terminal 13, fixed disk unit 14, and replaceable disk unit 
15. A number of add-on hardware modules 16 may also be 
connected to the system by way of the I/O bus. The I/O bus 
may be standard, conventional bus comprising data, address, 
and control

<CLAIMS>
A computer system comprising means for installing a 
sub-system, including means for automatically checking 

whether hardware resources required by the sub-system 
are available within the computer system and, if 

required hardware resources are not available, for 
automatically allocating alternative hardware resources 

to the sub-system. 
A system according to Claim 1 further including means 
for generating a report indicating the resources that 

have been allocated to a sub-system and indicating 
hardware configuration actions that are required in 

order to allow the sub-system to use the resource. 
A system according to either preceding claim wherein 
said hardware resources include at least some of the 

following: interrupt vector bits, DMA channel number, 
I/O address range, and memory address range.
