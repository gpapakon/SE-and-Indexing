<ABSTRACT>
A television receiving apparatus (1) having a 
video tape recorder unit (7) therein, for preventing a 

user from inserting his fingers into a cabinet (2) 
when the video tape recorded unit is removed from the 

cabinet for repair of the like, includes a locking 
mechanism of a controller door panel (10) at a 

position where it is closed. The controller door 
panel (10) is used for operating the video tape 

recorder unit contained in the apparatus. In order to 

surely obtain security of the user even when the 
locking operation is forgotten, the apparatus further 

includes a mechanism for interrupting supply of 
electric power to a television receiver when the 

absence of the video tape recorder unit in the cabinet 
is detected and when the controller door panel is 

detected to be opened at and more a predetermined 
angle. According to the invention, a possibility that 

the user will receive an electric shock can thus be 
eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television
receiving apparatus having a video tape recorder unit
therein, which apparatus is structured to eliminate a
risk that a user will receive a dangerous electric
shock.In a conventional television receiving
apparatus accommodating a video tape recorder unit
therein, a tuner device and an audio system used for a
television receiver are often incorporated in the video
tape recorder unit. Accordingly, when the video tape
recorder unit is absent in a cabinet of the apparatus
because of repair, for example, the television receiver
cannot receive television broadcasting.In contrast, in a television receiving
apparatus having a video tape recorder unit therein
according to the present invention, a television
receiver itself including a tuner device and an audio
system, and a video tape recorder unit are accommodated
in a common cabinet. It is therefore possible to
receive the television broadcasting by the television
receiver even if the video tape recorder unit is not
present in the cabinet. In this case, however, when a user who does not know
the absence of the video tape recorder unit in the
cabinet, tries to use the video tape recorder unit during
operation of the television receiver, there is a risk
that the user will undesirably insert his fingers into
the cabinet and receive an electric shock.DE-A-3444285 discloses a combined television receiving
apparatus and a video tape recorder unit according to the preamble of claim 1, however while
the video unit can be removed and the opening be closed
by a cover, this still leaves a potential hazard.EP-A-0505938 discloses another combined system, but in
this case a door is provided which can be opened from the
outside.It is an object of the invention to provide a
television receiving apparatus having a video tape
recorder unit therein which can eliminate the risk of the
electric shock as mentioned above.According to the invention, there is provided a
television receiving apparatus having a video tape
recorder unit therein, comprising:
a cabinet;an independent television receiver housed in said 
cabinet, and including a tuner device and an audio
system;a video tape recorder unit detachably accommodated
in said cabinet, connected to said television receiver,
and having an opening portion through which a video tape
cassette is inserted or discharged;a controller door panel provided on said cabinet and
adapted to open or close in correspondence to the opening
portion of said video tape recorder unit;
