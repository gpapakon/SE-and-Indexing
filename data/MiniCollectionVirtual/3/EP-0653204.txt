<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medicinal aerosol 
formulations and in particular to formulations suitable 
for pulmonary, nasal, buccal or topical administration 
which are at least substantially free of 
chlorofluorocarbons. Since the metered dose pressurised inhaler was 
introduced in the mid 1950's, inhalation has become the 
most widely used route for delivering bronchodilator drugs 
and steroids to the airways of asthmatic patients. 
Compared with oral administration of bronchodilators, 
inhalation offers a rapid onset of action and a low 
instance of systemic side effects. More recently, 
inhalation from a pressurised inhaler has been a route 
selected for the administration of other drugs, e.g., 
ergotamine, which are not primarily concerned with 
treatment of a bronchial malady. The metered dose inhaler is dependent upon the 
propulsive force of a propellant system used in its 
manufacture. The propellant generally comprises a mixture 
of liquified chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) which are 
selected to provide the desired vapour pressure and 
stability of the formulation. Propellants 11, 12 and 114 
are the most widely used propellants in aerosol 
formulations for inhalation administration. In recent years it has been established that CFC's 
react with the ozone layer around the earth and contribute 
towards its depletion. There has been considerable 
pressure around the world to reduce substantially the use 
of CFC's, and various Governments have banned the "non-essential" 
use of CFC's. Such "non-essential" uses 
include the use of CFC's as refrigerants and blowing 
agents, but heretofore the use of CFC's in medicines, 
which contributes to less than 1% of the total use of 
CFC's, has not been restricted. Nevertheless, in view of  
 
the adverse effect of CFC's on the ozone layer it is 
desirable to seek alternative propellant systems which are 
suitable for use in inhalation aerosols. U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,174,295 discloses 
aerosol propellant compositions which consist of a mixture 
of a hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or 
fluorocarbon (A), selected from the group consisting of 
CHClF₂ (Freon 22), CH₂F₂ (Freon 32) and CF₃-CH₃ (Freon 
143a), with a hydrogen-containing fluorocarbon or 
chlorofluorocarbon (B) selected from the group consisting 
of: CH₂ClF (Freon 31), CClF₂-CHClF (Freon 123a), CF₃-CHClF 
(Freon 124), CHF₂-CClF₂ (Freon 124a), CHClF-CHF₂ (Freon 
133), CF₃-CH₂Cl (Freon 133a), CHF₂-CHF₂ (Freon 134), 
CF₃-CH₂F (Freon 134a), CClF₂-CH₃ (Freon 142b) and 
CHF₂-CH₃ (Freon 152a).
