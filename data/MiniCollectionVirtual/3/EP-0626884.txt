<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a temperature- and acid-resistant catalyst carrier based on a gas-pervious carrier body and a porous surface layer having a high content of silicic acid, while dispensing with a washcoat, the carrier body and the surface layer are designed as a chemically and physically homogeneous structure shaped in a single operation, whose SiO2 content amounts to at least 99 % by weight and having a specific surface from 5 m
<
2
>
/g to 50 m
<
2
>
/g. In a process for producing a catalyst carrier made of synthetic, amorphous silicic acid particles with more than 99 % by weight SiO2, a plastic paste is prepared with the silicic acid particles, a liquid and a binder, a green compact is formed with the paste and then sintered. In order to design a continuous and economical process, plastifying agents are added to the paste and the paste is extruded into a monolithic green hank. The alkali and alkaline earth content of the paste is set at no more than 200 ppm and the green compact is sintered at a temperature in a range between 800  DEG C and 1400  DEG C.
