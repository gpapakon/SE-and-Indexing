<ABSTRACT>
Raw sewage, toilet paper or foreign matter is 
prevented from being stuck to an inner bowl of a stool 

by air bubbles. A cleaning mechanism of the stool 
comprises an outer cover (21) which has an upper opening 

and can store cleaning liquid (39) therein, an inner 
bowl (22) accommodated inside the outer cover (21) and a 

ring-shaped upper cover (23) which contacts the upper 
end of the outer cover (21). An upper end peripheral 

edge (35) of the inner bowl (22) is spaced from the 
outer cover (21) and upper cover (23) and air is spouted 

from air discharge bodies (38) provided at the bottom of 
the outer cover (21) so that the air discharge bodies 

(38) generate air bubbles which agitate the cleaning 
liquid (39) so as to generate bubbles which stick to the 

entire surface of the inner wall of the inner bowl (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toilet stool and a 
cleaning mechanism for preventing raw sewage or foreign 
matter such as paper from being stuck to an inner wall of an 
inner bowl of the stool and for cleaning the stool. In a toilet installed in a house, office or the like, a 
flush toilet which is connected to a water supply pipe and a 
sewage pipe is the mainstream for environmental utility and 
improvement of hygiene. The flush toilet has a reservoir 
tank which temporarily stores water from the supply pipe and 
a stool which is connected to the reservoir tank. When a 
user discharges raw sewage into the stool, the raw sewage 
can be forced to flow into the sewage pipe by discharging 
water from the reservoir tank, thereby facilitating the 
disposal of the raw sewage. In the disposal of raw sewage in the flush toilet, it is 
possible to discharge a large amount of water from the 
reservoir tank, thereby discharging raw sewage and at the 
same time cleaning the inner wall of the stool.
 
 
As mentioned above, in the flush toilet, the discharge 
of the raw sewage and the cleaning of the stool can be 
performed at the same time so that the flush toilet can 
be easily controlled. Even if the inner wall of the 
flush toilet is dirty, dirt can be cleaned by a brush, 
etc. by flushing water from the reservoir tank since the 
water is always supplied from the water supply pipe to 
the reservoir tank. As a result, the cleaning of the 
stool can be easily accomplished if there is a supply of 
water from the water supply pipe even if the cleaning is 
manually performed. However, there are many houses having no flush 
toilet, and the toilet stool connects to a purifying tank or 
a night soil tank since water supply and sewage pipes 
are not installed. In such a toilet, self-cleaning 
cannot be performed since water is not supplied to 
the toilet. Furthermore, since the purifying or night 
soil tank is connected to the stool, even if a large 
amount of water is flushed into the stool, the 
water is forced to flow into the purifying tank or night 
soil tank, and hence the dirt on the stool cannot be 
flushed by the water. In the toilet which is installed in a transportation 
facility such as vessels, airplanes or trains, a 
reservoir tank fixed to the transportation facility and 
a stool are connected to each other and raw sewage 
discharged to the stool is accommodated in the reservoir 
tank until the transportation facility reaches its 
destination. The reservoir tank is limited in its size 
because the

foaming material; and 

   air discharge bodies (38; 78) provided inside said 
bottom part of said outer cover (21; 71) for receiving 

air supplied from outside and for spouting said air 
therefrom.
