<CLAIMS>
Thermally stable weather-resistant polyamide moulding 
composition based on aliphatic or aromatic polyamides, 

which composition, in addition to 10 to 5000 ppm of 
ionic copper stabiliser or complexed copper 

stabiliser, contains from 10 to 2500 ppm of elemental, 
finely dispersed copper as a stabiliser which is 

formed 
in situ
 in the moulding composition from the 
ionic or complexed copper or in the polyamides used 

for the moulding composition before or during 
polymerisation of the polyamides. 
Polyamide moulding composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the elemental copper is present 

in colloidal form. 
Polyamide moulding composition according to claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that elemental copper is 

produced 
in situ
 from copper compounds during a 
compounding stage of the moulding composition. 
Polyamide moulding composition according to claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the polyamide consists of 

PA 6, PA 66, PA 46, PA 610, PA 11 or PA 12 or of 
copolyamides thereof as well as of blends of the 

stated polyamides. 
Polyamide moulding composition according to claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the ionic or complexed Cu 

stabiliser consists of CuBr, CuI, CuCl, Cu carbonate, 
Cu hydroxycarbonate, CuCN, Cu naphthenate or of copper 

complexes based on amines, phosphines, phenols or 
cyanides.  

 
Polyamide moulding composition according to claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that it contains kaolin, 

wollastonite, talcum or chalk as fillers and/or 
reinforcing materials, such as glass fibres, carbon 

fibres or mineral fibres, either alone or as a 
mixture. 
Process for the production of polyamide moulding 
compositions according to claims 1 to 6 by mixing an 

ionic or complexed copper stabiliser with polyamides 
or the starting materials thereof, characterised in 

that the elemental copper is produced from the copper 
stabiliser by reduction with salts of hypophosphorous 

acid or of dithionic acid, wherein the concentration 
of the reducing agent in the finished moulding 

compound is from 10 to 5000 ppm. 
Process for the production of a polyamide moulding 
composition according to claim 7, characterised in 

that the elemental copper is formed from copper 
compounds before or during polymerisation of a 

proportion of the polyamide and the resultant 
masterbatch is mixed with further polyamide. 
Use of the moulding composition according claims 1 to 
6 for the production of moulded articles. 
Mouldings produced from moulding compositions 
according to claims 1 to 6.
