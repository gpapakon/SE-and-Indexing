Leak indicator (4) for vacuum systems (1) which comprise 
a chamber (2) that is under vacuum during the operation 

of the system and also a vacuum pump (3) that serves to 
evacuate the chamber, the leak indicator (4) having a 

test-gas detector (6) taking the form of a mass 
spectrometer and also a high-vacuum pump (7) for 

generating the necessary pressure for the operation of 
the mass spectrometer, 
characterised in that
 a line (8) 
is provided in the leak indicator (4) which leads from a 

flange connection (5) for connecting the chamber (2) with 
the leak indicator (4) to the inlet side of the high-vacuum 

pump (7), in that the line (8) is equipped with a 
throttle (9) and also - between throttle (9) and inlet 

side of the high-vacuum pump (7) - with a valve (13) and 
in that a line (11) leading to the outlet side of the 

high-vacuum pump (7) is connected to the line (8) between 
the throttle (9) and the valve (13) so that in order to 

carry out a test for leaks the chamber (2) is optionally 
capable of being connected via the throttle (9) 


to the outlet side of the high-vacuum pump (7) only 
or 
jointly to the outlet side and the inlet side of the 
high-vacuum pump (7). 
Leak indicator (4) according to Claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the throttle (9) is a control valve. 
Leak indicator (4) according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the high-vacuum pump (7) is a 
component of a pump system (7, 21 or 7, 23) which 

generates a pressure on the pressure side that is of the  
 

order of magnitude of the operating pressure in the 
chamber (2) of the vacuum system (1). 
Leak indicator (4) according to Claim 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the outlet of the pump system (7, 21 or 7, 23) is 
connected via a line (22) to the flange connection (5) 

for the connection of the chamber (2). 
Leak indicator (4) according to Claim 3 or 4, 

characterised in that
 the pump system is a combined 
turbomolecular/molecular vacuum pump (7, 23). 
Leak indicator (4) according to Claim 3 or 4, 

characterised in that
 the pump system consists of a high-vacuum 
pump (7) and at least one membrane pump (21) 

arranged downstream of the high-vacuum pump. 
Process for searching for leaks in a vacuum system (1), 
in which points in the system that are suspected of 

leaking are sprayed from outside with a test gas, 
preferably helium, implemented with the aid of a leak 

indicator (4) according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 
the gas flowing to the mass-spectrometer detector (6) is 

throttled with the aid of the control valve (9) in such a 
way that the pressure in the mass-spectrometer detector 

(6) remains constant.
