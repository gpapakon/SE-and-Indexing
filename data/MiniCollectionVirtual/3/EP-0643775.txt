<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the use of redox compounds in therapeutic compositions.
The therapeutic compositions
are useful in enhancing cellular ATP production thereby ameliorating the effects of
reduced bioenergy capacity such as occurring during aging, systemic or vascular
disease or in conjunction with chemical therapy.Cells unable to meet their biological energy (bioenergy) demand from intracellular
produced ATP become non-functional and generally die. The bioenergy threshold
is different for various cell types and tissues of the body. For example, brain,
skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle have a high oxygen demand and are highly
dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Other tissues with lower
bioenergetic demand contain comparatively few mitochondria and rely to a greater
extent on glycolysis as a source of ATP.The two basic mechanisms responsible for cellular ATP production are cytosolic
glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. ATP synthesis via glycolytic processes
involves the oxidation of glucose to pyruvate, coupled to the reduction of NAD + to
NADH. In order for this pathway to be maintained, the supply of NAD + must
continually be regenerated through a redox sink. For example, in muscle tissue the
re-oxidation of NADH can be achieved by the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by
lactate dehydrogenase. In this case muscle lactate may be regarded as a redox sink
for that tissue. ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation in functionally respiring
mitochondria is integrated with the re-oxidation of NADH via the activity of the
electron transport system. In this case a supply of reduced pyridine nucleotides is
needed. In addition to NADH generated by glycolysis, further amounts of "reducing
power" (both pyridine and flavin nucleotides) are generated by the activities of the
TCA cycle as well as β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. Another significant
cell system involved in the maintenance of cellular NAD+ /NADH redox balance is
the plasma membrane oxidoreductase enzyme system (Crane et al, J. BioenergyBiomember 23, 773-803, 1991). In cases where the mitochondrial electron transport
chain is impaired (such as in mitochondrial disease and the ageing process), a
decline in ATP production and under certain conditions concomitant build up of
NADH is proposed to ensue. The metabolic consequence of such mitochondrial
dysfunction would be an increasing reliance by the cell on cytosolic glycolysis to
generate the ATP required for cellular maintenance and growth,
