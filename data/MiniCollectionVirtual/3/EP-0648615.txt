<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a stencil printing sheet and a process for 
perforating the same having the advantages in that there is 

no generation of any perforating failure at a time of 
stencil-making, any wrinkles, any conveying failure and any 

printing failure. In a stencil printing sheet constituted 
by laminating a resin film to a porous substrate, the 

present invention comprises a process for perforating the 
stencil printing sheet by using a solvent-soluble resin in 

the range of 0.1 - 100 µm in thickness as the above resin 
film, a stencil printing sheet as described that a 

solubility of the resin film to a solvent is within 100 
seconds in the resin layer of 10 µm in thickness, a stencil 

printing sheet as described that a viscosity of a solution 
dissolving 10 % by weight of the resin in the solvent is 

1000 cps or less at 20°C, and a stencil printing sheet 
constituted by laminating a solvent-soluble resin film to a 

porous substrate using a solvent, a process for perforating 
the stencil printing sheet by using a solvent which has a 

solubility is 100 seconds or less in a resin layer of 
10 µm in thickness and a viscosity of a solution is 

1000 cps or less at 20°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil printing 
sheet and a process for perforating the same. Specifically, 
it relates to a stencil printing sheet having a 
solvent-soluble resin layer and a process for perforating 
the same. In a prior art, a heat-sensitive stencil sheet is known 
which is produced by laminating a thermoplastic resin film 
on a porous substrate with an adhesive. A stencil-making of 
this heat-sensitive stencil sheet is carried out by means of 
(1) a process of superposing a hand written or preliminarily 
prepared manuscript on a heat-sensitive stencil sheet and 
then perforating by melting a thermoplastic resin film using 
the heat generated from e.g., flash pump, infrared lamp, 
(2) a process of bringing a thermal head which generates a 
dot-like heat in accordance with electrical signals from 
letter or picture information, in contact with a 
heat-sensitive stencil sheet, and perforating by melting a 
thermoplastic resin film of the sheet, and other processes. However, according to the stencil-making process 
described above, it was necessary to experience a  
 
complicated process of bringing a manuscript heated by absorbing 
light or thermal head in contact with a heat-sensitive 
stencil sheet, conducting the heat to the thermoplastic 
resin film of a heat-sensitive stencil sheet to melt the 
thermoplastic resin film and then shrinking the molten 
material to perforate the thermoplastic resin film, the 
stencil-making process had the disadvantages in that, for 
example, (1) a perforating failure was produced by the 
contacting failure between a thermoplastic resin film and a 
manuscript or thermal head which absorbed heat; (2) a 
perforating failure was produced by the nonuniformity in 
press pressure of a thermal head, resulting in producing 
wrinkles in a heat-sensitive stencil sheet; (3) the molten 
material of a thermoplastic resin film was adhered to a 
thermal head, resulting in producing a conveying failure of 
heat-sensitive stencil sheet; and (4) since the molten 
material was left in a perforated portion, the ink 
permeability was prevented, resulting in printing failure. In recent years, a further improvement in quality of 
heat-sensitive stencil sheet is demanded. It is demanded 
to provide such a heat-sensitive stencil sheet that 
satisfies the smoothness of a thermoplastic resin film, the 
separating property of the thermoplastic resin film from the 
manuscript or thermal head, the melting property due to 
heat, and the shrinkability of a thermoplastic resin
