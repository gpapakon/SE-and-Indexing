<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for alkylation of an isoparaffin with an olefin in the presence of acid catalyst composition comprising from 50 to 80 weight percent hydrofluoric acid, from 20 to 50 weight percent sulfolane, and from 0.5 to 10 weight percent water. The addition of the water decreases the corrosivity of the mixture of hydrofluoric acid and sulfolane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an isoparaffin:
olefin alkylation process.Alkylation is a reaction in which an alkyl group
is added to an organic molecule. Thus an isoparaffin
can be reacted with an olefin to provide an isoparaffin
of higher molecular weight. Industrially, the concept
depends on the reaction of a C2 to C5 olefin with
isobutane in the presence of an acidic catalyst
producing a so-called alkylate. This alkylate is a
valuable blending component in the manufacture of
gasolines due not only to its high octane rating but
also to its sensitivity to octane-enhancing additives.Industrial alkylation processes have historically
used concentrated hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid
catalysts under relatively low temperature conditions.
Acid strength is preferably maintained at 88 to 94
weight percent by the continuous addition of fresh acid
and the continuous withdrawal of spent acid. As used
herein, the term "concentrated hydrofluoric acid"
refers to an essentially anhydrous liquid containing at
least about 85 weight percent HF.Hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid alkylation
processes share inherent drawbacks including
environmental and safety concerns, acid consumption,
and sludge disposal. For a general discussion of
sulfuric acid alkylation, see the series of three
articles by L. F. Albright et al., "Alkylation of
Isobutane with C4 Olefins", 27 Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.,
381-397, (1988). For a survey of hydrofluoric acid
catalyzed alkylation, see 1 Handbook of Petroleum
Refining Processes 23-28 (R. A. Meyers, ed., 1986).Hydrogen fluoride, or hydrofluoric acid (HF) is
highly toxic and corrosive. Years of experience in its
manufacture and use have shown that HF can be handled
safely, provided the hazards are recognized and
precautions taken. Though many safety precautions are 
taken to prevent leaks, massive or catastrophic leaks
are feared primarily because the anhydrous acid will
fume on escape creating a vapor cloud that can spread
for a considerable distance. Previous workers in this
field approached this problem from the stand- point of
containing or neutralizing the HF cloud in the event of
an accidental release.U.S. Patents 4,938,935 and 4,985,220 to Audeh and
Greco, as well as U.S. Patent 4,938,936 to Yan teach
various methods for containing and/or neutralizing HF
acid clouds following accidental release.However, it would be particularly desirable to
provide an additive which decreases the cloud forming
tendency of HF without compromising its activity as an
isoparaffin:olefin alkylation catalyst. Thus,
