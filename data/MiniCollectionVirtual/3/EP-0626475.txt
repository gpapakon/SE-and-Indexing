Method of controlling the tension in a pile warp (4) which can be drawn from a pile-warp 
beam (1) controlled by the warp let-off over at least one deflection roller (5) and 

one tension roller (7) in the manufacture of towelling on looms, according to which the 
tension of the pile warp (4) is influenced, during each full beating-up following partial 

beatings-up, of a weaving reed connected to the weaving reed shaft to form a row of 
loops, 
characterized in that
 the tension exerted on the pile warp (4) by the tension 
roller (7) is positively compensated by means of a control mechanism (13) during each 

full beating-up of the weaving reed and is subsequently brought about positively after 
each securing of each row of loops. 
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, in which the tension roller 
(7) is carried by at least two swinging arms (6) spaced apart and mounted on a common 

swivel pin (8), 
characterized in that
 the swinging arms (6) are operatively connected 
to a control mechanism (13) for positively influencing the tension exerted on the pile 

warp (4) by the tension roller (7), as well as to a biassing means (10, 11) which bears 
against a fixed portion (12) of the loom. 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the biassing means (10, II) 
consists of at least one mechanically-, pneumatically-, hydraulically-, hydro-mechanically- 

or pneumo-mechanically-operating device. 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the control mechanism (13) 
includes: 


at least one cam actuator (16) (single cam or complementary cams) connected to a 
towelling shaft (15), and 
at least one lever (18) which is pivotably mounted and follows the movement of the 
cam (16), and which is connected to a tie rod (14) engaging the swinging arm (6). 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the tie rod (14) engages the 
swinging arm (6) in an articulated manner whereas it extends through a guide element 

(20) on the lever (18) and has a travel limiter (14a) at its free end. 
Device according to claim 4 and claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the tie rod (14) can 
be fixed at a variable height both on the swinging arm (6) and on the lever (18).
