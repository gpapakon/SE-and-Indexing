Dash-board comprising a front side (1) and, in front of the 
front side, indicator means (4-6) intended to be illuminated by 

at least one illumination source (8,9,11,12,22,23) extending in 
a recess (7,13,14,20) provided in the depth of the front side (1) 

and forming a light box, characterised by the fact that there is 
provided, in the front side (1) , at least one recess (13,14) 

for receiving at least one illumination source (11,12), in the 
shape of a dish, with a rear bottom veil (15) for surrounding the 

source (11,12) and reflecting the light. 
Dash-board according to Claim 1, in which the indicator means 
comprise at least one graphic arrangement (4) screen-printed on 

a support (2) and a recess (7) for receiving at least one
