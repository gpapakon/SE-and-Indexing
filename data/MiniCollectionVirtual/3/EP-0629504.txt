<ABSTRACT>
A composite orifice plate for a printer such as a thermal inkjet printer 
includes a first layer (22) of non-wettable material and a second layer (23) of 

wettable material joined to the first layer (22). In the orifice plate, nozzle 
openings (25) extending through the first and second layers (23) allow ink to be 

ejected through an outlet (26) located on a surface of the first layer (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to orifice plates for inkjet
printers and to processes for manufacture thereof.In practice, the print quality of inkjet printers depends upon the
physical characteristics of the nozzles in its printhead. For example, the
geometry of a printhead orifice nozzle can affect the size, trajectory, and speed
of ink drop ejection. Also, the geometry of a printhead orifice nozzle can
affect the ink supply flow to the associated vaporization chamber.Figure 1 shows an example of a conventional inkjet printhead.
The illustrated section of the printhead includes a silicon substrate 7, an
intermediate polymer barrier layer 9, and an electroplated nozzle plate 11. In
the nozzle plate 11, a nozzle orifice 13 is formed having an inlet area 14 and an
outlet area 16. It should be understood that a conventional printhead has an
array of such nozzle orifices with each nozzle orifice being paired with a
vaporization cavity.As further shown in Figure 1, the silicon substrate 7 and the
polymer barrier layer 9 together define a vaporization cavity 19 which is in
fluid communication with the nozzle orifice 13. The vaporization cavity 19 is
sometimes referred to as an ink drop ejection chamber. Further in Figure 1, it should be noted that a dead space 15 is
formed where the surface of the barrier layer 9 separates from the converging
sidewall 17 that defines the orifice 13 in the electroplated nozzle plate 11.
Although such dead spaces are typical in conventional printheads for inkjet
printers, they are problematical because they provide sites where static bubbles
can be trapped. The trapped bubbles, in turn, can adversely affect the fluid
dynamics of ejected drops.It should be understood that, in a conventional inkjet printhead, a
heater resistor (not shown in Figure 1) is positioned within each vaporization
cavity. Then, all of the heater resistors are connected in a network for
selective activation. Also, a conventional printhead includes a channel (not
shown in Figure 1) that provides ink flow communication between each
vaporization cavity and an ink supply reservoir.In practice, the above-described conventional inkjet printhead has
several shortcomings. For instance, conventional inkjet printheads have a metal
orifice plate that is inherently wettable and, therefore, provides a surface for
ink runout over the outer surface of the orifice plate. The ink runout can cause
a condition known as "ink puddling" that may create misdirection and spraying
of ink droplets during ejection. On the
