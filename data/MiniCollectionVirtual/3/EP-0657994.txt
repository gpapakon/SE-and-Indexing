<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oscillation circuit and, 
more particularly, to an oscillation circuit that may be set 
into oscillation at a low voltage. Heretofore, an oscillator employing a quartz 
oscillator in a semiconductor integrated circuit of the CMOS 
structure is arranged as shown in Fig.4. In the prior-art example, shown in Fig.4, a p-type(p-channel) 
MOSFET 501 and an n-type(n-channel) MOSFET 502, 
connected in a form of a complementary pair, constitutes an  
 
inverter. A resistor 504 and a quartz oscillator 505 are 
connected in parallel to each other across the input and the 
output of the inverter, and capacitors 506, 507 are provided 
across both terminals of the quartz oscillator 505 and the 
ground. Although the resistor 504 and the capacitors 506, 507 
are occasionally formed on a semiconductor integrated 
circuit, they are shown herein as being provided externally 
of the semiconductor integrated circuit, because such is not 
essential to the description of the present invention. In the present prior-art example, the inverter formed 
on the semiconductor integrated circuit operates as an 
amplifier, while the capacitors 506, 507 and the quartz 
oscillator 505 operate as a frequency filter, so that the 
components shown operate as an oscillator in their entirety. It is first assumed that a power supply voltage 
(referred to hereinafter as Vdd) is no less than the sum of 
a threshold voltage at which the n-type MOSFET 502 begins to 
be conductive(referred to hereinafter as VTN) and a 
threshold voltage at which the p-type MOSFET 502 begins to 
be conductive(referred to hereinafter as VTP). That is, the 
power supply voltage Vdd is assumed to be in a range that 
can be expressed as,

VTN + | VTP | ≦ Vdd   (1) 


 
   where a symbol "| VTP |" denotes the absolute value of  
 
VTP. The reason is that the threshold voltage of a MOSFET is 
associated with the gate-to-source voltage at which the 
MOSFET begins to turn on such that the threshold voltage VTP 
of the p-type (enhancement) MOSFET is dealt with as a 
negative value, while the threshold voltage VTN of the n-type 
(enhancement) MOSFET is of a positive value . If the input voltage applied to an input terminal 508 
of the inverter is in a range from 0 to VTN, the p-type 
MOSFET 501 is in a conductive state, while the n-type MOSFET 
502 is in a non-conductive state, so that a Vdd level is 
outputted at an output terminal 511 of the inverter. If the inverter input voltage is in a range from Vdd - 
| VTP | to Vdd, the p-type MOSFET 501
