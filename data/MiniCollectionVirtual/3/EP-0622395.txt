Batch-wise, catalytic process for preparing polyamide-6,6 
with a relative viscosity of at least 2.2 (measured 

at 25°C in a 1 % strength polyamide solution in 96 % 
strength sulphuric acid) by heating a 75 to 85 % 

strength, aqueous solution of hexamethylenediamine 
adipate (AH salt) in a sealed system under autogenic, 

increasing pressure, precondensation with evaporation of 
the water at constant pressure and melt polycondensation 

at a pressure falling to 1 bar or less and a temperature 
in the range 260 to 290°C and optionally solid phase

phosphorus, with respect to solid AH salt, and that this 
solution is heated above 175°C at a rate in the range 

0.5 to 3.0 °C/min until the precondensation pressure is 
achieved, and precondensation is performed at a pressure 

in the range 7 to 10 bar absolute, with a final 
temperature in the range 235 - 260°C and with a rate of
