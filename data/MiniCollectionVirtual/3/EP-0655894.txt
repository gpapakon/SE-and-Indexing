<ABSTRACT>
A squeegee, liquid applicator or similar device having a handle (10) pivotally attached to a head (5) whereby the head (5), containing a squeegee blade (1) and/or wiping component (6, 7), is pivotal relative to the handle (10) in a plane (3) inclined toward the top of the handle (10) when the device is in use whereby motion of the head (5) is readily controllable by rotation or twisting of the handle (10) as the handle (10) follows an "S" shaped path of motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for use in wiping,
painting, cleaning, or similar purposes, of substantially
flat surfaces such as floors, walls and windows. It has
particular advantages in relation to squeegees and devices
comprising the combination of a squeegee and a scrubbing
or washing device such as a sponge or brush but it is not
limited to such devices. The general applicability of
devices comprising the present invention will be readily
apparent to a skilled addressee.In order to efficiently clean a large surface area,
such as a window or floor, it is advantageous to be able
to clean in an "S" type side to side sweeping action.
This is of a particular advantage when removing water from
the surface by using a squeegee as it allows a large
surface area to be covered quickly but without leaving
behind any water and corresponding streaks. In an effort
to obtain this sort of motion, there are known cleaning
devices, including squeegees, which have a hinge within a
handle so that the angle between the squeegee blade holder
and handle can be set at a number of different angles. In
some cases these pivots are designed to be used loose,
such that the head holding the squeegee blade is free to
pivot relative to the handle. However, in those known
devices, especially when used with a long handle, there is
little or no control of the orientation of the squeegee
head which tends to revolve freely making the device
practically useless.In the field of paint application by rollers,
brushes, sponges and similar surface contacting devices
there are difficulties in obtaining an even finish in a
minimum time. The problems of paint application are
especially apparent in finishing internal corners with 
rollers and the need to resort to brushes to complete that
task.WO 89/10721 (AU-89 00195) discloses a device for cleaning
surfaces. The device has two pivotal connections to connect a
cleaning head and a handle. Both pivotal connections have
axes that are parallel to the plane of the surface being
cleaned.WO 92/19142 discloses a device for cleaning automobile
windows. The device comprises a member having two pivotal
connections, one of which couples the member and a head and
the other of which couples the member and a handle. The first
pivotal connection defines a pivotal axis disposed at an angle
between 0 to 90 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of
the handle. However, WO 92/19142 does not use a single
pivotal connection.DE-A-3823456 discloses a mop comprising a member having
two pivotal connections for

<CLAIMS>
A wiping device for use on a substantially planar
surface (16), having a head (5) adapted to hold a squeegee

blade, pad, brush or the like; a handle (10) extending
from a point substantially central of the head (5), the

handle (10) having a longitudinal axis, and a single pivotal
connection (13) between the handle (10) and the head (5),

characterised in that the pivotal connection (13) defines
a pivotal axis which is disposed at an angle that is

substantially greater than 0 degrees but substantially
less than 90 degrees, relative to the longitudinal axis of

the handle (10).
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the angle is 52
degrees.
A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the head
(5) is adapted to hold a squeegee blade (1).
A device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the head (5)
has a body (6) adapted to hold a cleaning or wiping

component (7) positioned so that in use the component (7)
and the squeegee blade (1) operate simultaneously on the

planar surface (16), with the squeegee blade (1) trailing
the component (7) in use.
A device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the component
(7) is a brush or a pad.
A device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the
squeegee blade (1) is rotatable about the single axis of

the pivotal connection (13) or is retractable relative to
the planar surface (16), such that the component (7) is

operable without the squeegee blade (1) contacting the
planar surface (16). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6,
wherein the body (6) has a quadrilateral shape in plan

view, having two of its sides parallel and the other two
sides oppositely inclined relative to each other.
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the handle (10) is adapted to receive a handle

extension attachable to the handle (10) in a torque
transmitting arrangement.
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 which
functions so that in use when the handle (10) is

maintained at a substantially constant angle relative to
the planar surface (16), any change in orientation of the

squeegee (1) results in or depends on a rotation or
twisting of the handle (10).
A device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the squeegee
blade (1) has its longitudinal axis at right angles to the

single axis of the pivotal connection (13).
A device as claimed in claim 4 or in any of claims 5
to 9 as dependant from claim
 4, wherein the body (6) has a
length perpendicular to the pivotal axis.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the head (5) has a transverse direction and a longitudinal

direction and comprises a wiping component (7) having an
engagement surface for engaging the planar surface, the

pivotal connection (13) is substantially central
transversely of the head (5), and the handle portion (10)

extends away from the head (5) generally in the
longitudinal direction.
