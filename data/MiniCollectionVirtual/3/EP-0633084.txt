<ABSTRACT>
A drilling device for making undercut holes is proposed in which the drilling spindle (4) is pivotably mounted in a pivot bearing (13). A deflection element (19) which projects on one side on a rotary ring (11) tilts the drilling spindle (4) out of the position of the drilling centre axis (17). In order to obtain a wobbling movement, the rotary ring (11) is set in rotation by means of a drive device (2). The drill head (5) of a drilling tool connected to the drilling spindle (4) thereby performs a wobbling movement about the bearing centre point (18) of the pivot bearing (13).

A device for producing drilled holes with an 
undercut, in particular in facing panels of ceramics, 

stone, concrete or similar materials, having a drill 
shank (4) mounted in a swivel bearing (13) and having 

swivelling means (19, 20, 22, 24) with which the drill 
shank (4) is displaced in a gyratory movement about the 

centre line of drilling (17), characterized in that a 
displacement element (19, 24) projecting at one side 

from the bearing of the drill shank (4) displaces the 
drill shank (4) against the resilient restoring force 

of rubber bearings (22) or other resilient elements 
from the centre line of drilling (17), and the 

displacement element (19, 24) moves around on a ring 
(20). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the drill shank (4) is mounted in a bearing bush 

(12) from which there projects a bearing flange (21) 
that lies on a resilient O-ring (22) serving as the 

resilient element. 
A device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the displacement element (19, 24) 

rotates at a lower speed than the drill shank (4). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the drill shank (4) and the displacement element 

(19, 24) are driven by a common drive motor (7) by way 
of a belt drive assembly (8). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a rotatable ring (11), from which 

the displacement element (19, 24) projects and which is  
 

driven by a drive motor (7), is arranged coaxially with 
respect to the centre line (17) of the drill shank (4) 

and rotates on the bearing of the drill shank (4). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the displacement element is a 

roller (19) or other bearing element (24). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the displacement element (19, 24) 

or the ring (20) is vertically adjustable.
