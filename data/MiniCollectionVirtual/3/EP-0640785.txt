<ABSTRACT>
A combination control valve wherein the seal towards the valve 
exterior is achieved by a double gland (32,35) which straddles a lantern 

sleeve (28) with an intermediate vent (29) and is pressed axially between 
the stem (23) and guide (11) for the main valving member (5) by preloaded 

elastic elements (37), said guide being held elastically pressed 
against the differently inclined surface of a shoulder ring 

(42) retained by circular sectors (43,44) fitted into the valve body, 
a series 

of labyrinths (13) being interposed between said guide and said main 
valving member, the pilot valving member (26) being of parabolic 

profile, a bellows elastic seal element (12) being provided between the 
first seat (4) and the valve body (1), the trim consisting of a hollow 

cylindrical structure (14) which is inserted coaxially into an end 
cavity in the main valving member, is provided with transverse 

holes (16,17,18) arranged offset from corresponding holes (19,20) 
in the cavity of 

said main valving member, and terminates with a parabolic profile (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new combination control valve which by 
using effective seal systems, a multiple pressure-step trim, 
suitable main and pilot valving member profiles and a series of 
labyrinths interposed between the main valving member and its 
guide, results in excellent control from minimum to maximum 
throughput, a high rangeability, an effective seal between the 
upstream and downstream sides of the valve and a perfect seal 
towards the valve exterior, intrinsic safety of said valve in the 
case of malfunction of the seal system towards the valve exterior, 
extreme ease and facility of disassembly and assembly, and a small 
actuation force requirement. As is well known, devices have to be installed between the primary 
and secondary superheater in the boiler start-up circuit of 
thermoelectric power plant to keep the boiler out of action during 
plant start-up until the process fluid conditions upstream of such 
devices reach rated values, to reduce the pressure of the entire 
start-up flow and finally to allow said process fluid to pass at 
maximum throughput with low pressure drop. Initially said devices consisted of two separate valves, one with  
 
a control function and the other with an on-off function. Currently, a single valve is used, known as a combination valve, 
which is able to perform both functions. Said combination valve 
comprises substantially a valve body provided with a fluid inlet 
and outlet, a first seat on said outlet for a main valving member 
provided with balancing holes and slidable along a guide by way of 
interposed seal elements for balancing the main valving member, a pilot 
valving member rigid with a valve stem to cooperate with a 
second seat present within said main valving member and provided 
with a spring-loaded shoulder arranged to cooperate with the main 
valving member, a trim suitable for reducing the fluid pressure, 
and seal systems between said first seat and said valve body and, 
respectively, towards the valve exterior. The known combination valves of the state of the art all present a 
series of drawbacks, the main one being that they provide neither 
a secure and effective seal towards the outside nor intrinsic 
safety in that, in the case of malfunction of the seal system 
towards the valve exterior, it is impossible to compensate for 
balancing purposes said outward leakage through said seal 
elements, so causing depressurization of the chamber upstream and 
generating on this latter intolerable upstream forces leading to 
inevitable

A combination control valve particularly suitable for 
thermoelectric power plant, comprising substantially a valve body (1) 

provided with a fluid inlet (2) and outlet (3), a first seat (4) on said 
outlet (3) for a main valving member (5) provided with balancing holes (6,7) and 

slidable along a guide (11) by way of interposed seal elements (13) for 
balancing the main valving member (5), a pilot valving member (22) rigid with 

a valve stem (23) to cooperate with a second seat (21) present within said 
main valving member (5) and provided with a spring-loaded shoulder (24) 

arranged to cooperate with the main valving member (5), a trim 
suitable for reducing the fluid pressure and seal systems between 

said first seat (4) and said valve body (1), respectively, towards the 
valve exterior, characterised in that sealing of said stem (23) towards the 

valve exterior is achieved by a double gland (30-36) which straddles a 
lantern sleeve (28) with an intermediate vent for detecting leakages, 

and which is installed between said valve stem (23) and the main valving member 
guide (11), and is pressed axially by preloaded elastic elements (37), said 

guide (11) being held, elastically pressed by its own series of 
preloaded elastic elements (40), against a surface (41) of a shou
lder ring (42)
