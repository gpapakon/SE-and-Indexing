<ABSTRACT>
Method of fixing onto the frame (2) of an appliance such as a fax machine elements for holding (6) elastic means (4) for applying pressure to the counter-rollers (3) for driving sheets of paper. To this end, it comprises the steps consisting in:   - applying the said holding elements onto the said elastic means in such a way as to compress the latter; - bringing the said holding elements into a position of insertion in appropriate means (8, 11, 12) of the frame; - causing and keeping the said insertion by the compression force of the said elastic means.

<CLAIMS>
Method for fixing on the frame (2) of an apparatus such
as a facsimile machine, members (6) for retaining spring means

(4) for pressurising counter-rollers (3) for the driving of
sheets of paper, comprising the steps consisting of:


fitting said retaining members on said spring means in
order to compress the latter;
bringing said retaining members into an interlocked
position in appropriate means (8, 11, 12) of the frame;

method characterised by the fact that it also comprises a step
consisting of causing and maintaining said interlocking by the

compression force of said spring means.
Device for pressuring counter-rollers (3) for
the driving of sheets of paper in an apparatus such as a

facsimile machine, comprising spring means (4) compressed
between said counter-rollers and a retaining member (6) fixed to

the frame (2) of the apparatus and interlocked in appropriate
means (8, 11, 12) of the frame, device characterised by the fact

that the retaining member is held in its interlocked position by
the compression force of said spring means.
Device according to Claim 2, in which said member is a
support plate.
Device according to Claim 3, in which said plate has at
least one extension (10).
