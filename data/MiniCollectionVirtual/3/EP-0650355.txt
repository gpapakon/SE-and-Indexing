<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of those 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, which are active in the Rat Model of Colo-rectal Distension at a dose determined as the dose at which 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity is observed in standard tests, such as the Bezold-Jarisch model, in the treatment of visceral pain, such as the pain symptoms of IBS, and also migraine.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MEDI CAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF V ISCERAL PAIN AND MI GRAINEThis invention relates to the use of certain compounds which are 5-HT3 receptor antagonists as visceral analgesics.EP-A-279512 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) describes the use of certain 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, including granisetron (KYTRIL) in the treatment of visceral pain.Visceral pain is a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and granisetron has been found to desensitise the rectum in IBS patients as shown by double-blind placebo-controlled studies, at doses of 120 μg/kg and 50 μg/kg, 120 μg/kg being most effective. (Prior and Read, 1990; Gut 11 (10) A1174).Granisetron has been found to be active in an animal model of rectal sensitivity to distension (see method described hereafter).5-HT3 receptor antagonists which have the same effect as granisetron in this model, include zatosetron (Lilly) and metoclopramide.The invention therefore relates to the use of those 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, which are active in the animal model at a dose determined as the dose at which 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity is observed in standard tests, such as the Bezold-Jarisch model, in the treatment of visceral pain, such as the pain symptoms of IBS, and also migraine.Preferred compounds are active at a lower dose than the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist dose. Compounds which are approved or under clinical investigation are active at a similar dosage level to that which is used for antiemetic use.Suitable modes of administration, formulations, etc. are as described in EP-A-279512.5-HT3 receptor antagonists which should be considered for this invention include those specifically and generically disclosed and referenced in EP-A-450757 (Glaxo Group Limited). 

Rat Model of Colo-rectal DistensionA 6-7 cm latex balloon was inserted intra-anally into male Wistar rats (250-650g) under halothane anaesthesia; the balloon catheter was taped to the tail. After recovery the animals were allowed unrestricted movement and were dosed with either vehicle (saline) or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP lOmgkg"! subcutaneously). At 5 min post- dose a ramp inflation of the colo-rectal balloon was carried out for approximately 10- 30s until the visceromotor threshold (abdominal muscle contraction) was observed; the stimulus was then immediately removed and threshold pressure noted. This inflation procedure was repeated at 5 min intervals. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or saline were dosed subcutaneously after 3 stable responses were achieved and within 45 min of dosing 5-HTP or vehicle.

Claims
1. A method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of visceral pain, in mammals, including humans, which method comprises administering to the mammal in need of such treatment and/or prophylaxis, an effective and/or prophylactic amount of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which is active in the animal model at a dose determined as the dose at which 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity is observed in standard tests, such as the Bezold-Jarisch model.
2. The use of those 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, which are active in the animal model at a dose determined as the dose at which 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity is observed in standard tests, such as the Bezold-Jarisch model, in the treatment of visceral pain.
3. A pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of visceral pain, which comprises a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which is active in the animal model at a dose determined as the dose at which 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activity is observed in standard tests, such as the Bezold-Jarisch model, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
4. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the compound is active at a lower dose than the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist dose.
5. A method, use or composition according to claim 4 for the treatment of the pain symptoms of IBS.
6. A method, use or composition according to claim 5 for the treatment of also migraine.
7. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the
5-HT3 receptor antagonist is selected from those specifically and generically disclosed and referenced in EP-A-450757 (Glaxo Group Limited).
8. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is granisetron.
9. A method, use or composition according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is zatosetron (Lilly) or metoclopramide.
