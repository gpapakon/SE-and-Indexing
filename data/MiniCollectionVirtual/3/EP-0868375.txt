<ABSTRACT>
In the described commissioning installation for the automatic computer-controlled supply of items (18) like cigarettes from a storage area (1) with stack continuous storage units (2) to a transfer station (35) in accordance with commissioning requests, for each kind of item (18) to be commissioned there is at least one continuous storage unit (2) with an individual ejector (10) allocated to it and possibly also a continuous storage unit (2) with a multiple ejector (14) allocated to it, where the ejectors (10; 14) eject on at least one collective conveyor (3) connecting via a sorting section (20) with a conveyor system (26) with branches (29, 30, 31) to which are connected separate conveyor branches (44, 45, 46) leading to separate transfer points (32, 33, 34) in the transfer station (35).

<CLAIMS>
A commissioning installation for automatically supplying
elongate items (18), e.g. tobacco products, computer-controlled

from a storage region (1) to a transfer station (35) in
accordance with commissioning orders and without using

commissioning containers, wherein

the storage region (1) for each type of item (18) to be
commissioned has at least one throughput storage unit (2) with

an associated ejector (10, 14), the items being length-wise
aligned adjacently arranged in stacks (6) in the longitudinal

direction of the throughput storage unit (2), and the ejectors
(10; 14) being arranged on at least one longitudinal side of at

least one collecting conveyor (3) onto which they directly eject
the items (18) so that the items (18) come to lie with their

longitudinal axis transversely to the conveying direction (19)
of the collecting conveyor (3), characterised in that
at least one throughput storage unit (2) comprising a single-item
ejector (10) and, for items with a high throughput rate, at

least one throughput storage unit (2) comprising a multiple item
ejector (14) are provided,
a conveying system (26) comprising branchings (29, 30, 31) and
associated shunts (27, 28) follows upon the collecting conveyor

(3), via a sorting path (20) providing the items individually
and longitudinally aligned, and
separate conveying branches (44, 45, 46) follow upon the
branchings (29, 30, 31), via conveyors (47, 48, 49) conveying

transversely away, each respective separate conveying branch
(44, 45, 46) leading to a separate transfer site (32, 33, 34) in

the transfer station (35) for packing the items.
A commissioning installation according to claim 1,
characterised in that the collecting conveyor (3) is formed by a

conveyor belt.
A commissioning installation according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the throughput storage units (2) are

designed with roller paths downwardly inclined from the filling
side towards the associated ejector. 
A commissioning installation according to any one of claims
1 to 3, characterised in that commissioning heads (4) each

receiving several item stacks (6) comprising retention plates
(11, 15) releasing at least the lowermost layer (7) of the

stacks (6) yet holding back the upper stack layers (7) are
provided for the ejectors.
A commissioning installation according to any one of claims
1 to 3, characterised in that to provide the items (18)

individually and in alignment, the sorting path (20) is set up
with progressively faster moving conveyors (21, 22) at whose

upper sides directing devices (23, 24) are attached.
A commissioning installation according to any one of claims
1 to 5, characterised in that each conveyor (47, 48, 49)

conveying transversely away from the associated branching (29,

30, 31) follows at the front end of the respective conveying
system branching (29, 30, 31) via a front-side ascending

conveyor (50, 51, 52).
A commissioning installation according to claim 6,
characterised in that the ascending conveyor (50, 51, 52) is,

e.g. continuously, drivable at a conveying speed which is high
in comparison to the conveying speed of the conveying system

(26).
A commissioning installation according to claim 6 or 7,
characterised in that the ascending conveyor (50, 51, 52) has an

ascent of approximately 5Â°.
A commissioning installation according to any one of claims
1 to 8, characterised in that each conveyor (47, 48, 49)

conveying transversely away from the associated branching (29,
30, 31) is formed by a transverse belt.
A commissioning installation according to any one of
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the conveying branches (44,

45, 46) leading to the transfer sites (32, 33, 34) are formed by 
roller paths downwardly inclined in the conveying direction.
A commissioning installation according to any one of
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that at the individual transfer

sites (32, 33, 34) the conveying branches (44, 45, 46) have
associated slides (55) slidable transversely to the conveying

direction of the former for shifting items (18), e.g. in groups,
towards one edge of a packing table (58).
A commissioning installation according to any one of
claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the throughput storage

devices (2) are item stack throughput storage devices.
