<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for removing particles of a first liquid having a lighter density, such as oil, from a second liquid having a greater density, such as water. A separator chamber (28) with a plurality of parallel subchannels (142, 144, 146, 148 and 150) formed by spaced vertical plates (120, 122, 124 and 126) has a geometry causing the flow therethrough to be substantially non-turbulent. The flow path length through the separator chamber is such that the particles will have sufficient time to rise above a downstream exit weir (110) and into a holding chamber (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to an apparatus and
method for separating two immiscible liquids of different densities such as
oil and water and also for removing sediment therefrom, and in particular,
to an apparatus and method for separating immiscible particles and solids
from a flowing fluid mixture using the buoyancy principles embodied in
Stokes' law.It is often desired to remove immiscible oil particles from runoff or
drainage discharge water so as to avoid polluting streams, lakes, wells, or
the like. As concern increases for the environment, the various states as
well as the federal government have imposed regulations governing the
quality of such effluent water. Such effluent water might be seen, for
instance, as surface runoff from a parking lot during periodic rainfalls.Prior solutions for this problem have attempted to use the principles
of Stokes' law,
F = 6πηrvO
which expresses the drag force F exerted on a sphere, such as an oil
particle, of radius r moving with a rise speed vo through a fluid, such as
water, that has a viscosity η. The oil particle naturally tends to rise due to 
the forces of gravity because it has a lower density ρo than that of water,
ρw, thereby causing the oil particle to have buoyant forces thereupon.
However, in order for Stokes' law to strictly apply, the fluid must be
quiescent and non-moving, or, at best, a "creeping flow," and the particles
must be substantially rigid (non-deformable) spheres. In such a situation,
there is no separation of liquid from the rear of the rising sphere as it
moves, and viscous effects dominate the particle's movement. The
Reynolds number R0 of the oil particle, governing its rise through water, is
well-known to be
RO = ρWvOdη
where d is the diameter of the spherical oil particle. If the Reynolds rise
number R0 is greater than 0.1, the drag force F on the sphere will be
underpredicted and the oil particle will rise more slowly than expected.
For instance, if R0 is 1.0, the drag force F will be underpredicted by a
factor of ten percent (10%). See R. Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart, and
Edwin N. Lightfoot, Transport Phenomena 192-94 (1960).The preceding discussion shall be understood to apply primarily to
small oil particles only, in the range of ten to twenty microns in diameter
and below, which are the hardest particles to remove. Larger diameter
liquid spheres will have higher terminal velocities than that predicted by
Stokes' Law due to internal liquid circulation within the spheres in a
manner well-known to those
