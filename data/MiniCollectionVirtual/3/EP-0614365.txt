<ABSTRACT>
The compound diflunisal (5-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-salicylic acid) of formula (I) is used for the production of a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, Crohn's disease and uveitis. Preferably compositions, such as cremes and ointments, for local use on skin surfaces, eye agents, compositions for local treatment of the intestinal canal, vaginal agents, compositions for local use in the oral cavity and compositions for inhalation are produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Use of a known chemical compound for the production of a pharmaceutical composition for topical applicationThe present invention concerns the use of the compound di- flunisal (5-( 2,4-difluorophenyl)-salicylic acid) of the formula:for the production of a pharmaceutical composition for topical treatment of inflammatory and/or autoimmune dis¬ eases, such as psoriasis, Crohn's disease and uveitis.An example of these diseases is psoriasis which is a cro- nic skin disease of unknown etiology. The indidence is about 2-3% in most western countries. The disease is here¬ ditary, presumably polymerically conditioned, with irregu¬ larly occurring manifestations that may be caused mechani¬ cally, but probably also by other influences, infections, psychic strain, etc. The onset of the disease is usually at the age of 20-30. It manifests itself as regular, slightly infiltrated, hyperemic pat - which are covered by stearin-like scales consisting o.. Λ»any layers. The dis¬ ease is localized to the epidermis, and it is character- ized by increased cell turnover. The normal cell turnover, which means the time it takes for a recently formed cell to get from the basal cell layer to the horny layer at the surface of the skin, is usually about 4 weeks, but in case of psoriasis it just takes 2-3 days. 

 According to the clinical nature of the disease a distinc¬ tion is made between a number of different clinical forms, all of which are comprised by the designation "psoriasis" in the present context.A plurality of modes of treatment have been employed in the course of time with a view to keeping the disease under control (1): Thus, drugs are used for topical appli¬ cation, such as corticosteroids, calcipotriol, anthralin (dithranol) and coal tar. In severe cases systemic treat¬ ment with drugs is used, such as methotrexate or aromatic retinoids, and phototherapy alone or in combination with psoralens. Combinations of these systemic and topical modes of treatment have been in general use in recent years.The more effective treatments usually involve a high risk of serious side effects. Topically applied corticosteroids are moreover rendered more or less ineffective after a re- latively short time. Anthralin is difficult to administer for the patient owing to discoloration and a considerable risk of inducing serious irritations, although these draw¬ backs have been mitigated to some extent after the intro¬ duction of the so-called minute therapy, comprising apply- ing the drug to the skin for just 10-30 minutes.
