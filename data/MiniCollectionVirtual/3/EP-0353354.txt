<ABSTRACT>
A performance monitor apparatus for a minehunting operation, 
the apparatus comprising means 1, for gathering environmental data 

relevant to minehunting performance, first data storage means 15 
for minehunting performance prediction algorithms, second data 

storage means for system/ship/mine target parameters, and 
performance prediction means capable of providing an output signal 

relevant to expected minehunting performance. This gives increased 
efficiency in the searching operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a performance monitor apparatus. It 
relates particularly to such an apparatus which is suitable for 
assisting a minehunting operation at sea. In a minehunting operation, the overall success of the 
operation depends at least partly upon the accuracy of the mission 
planning stage. This stage precedes the actual minehunting 
operation and it provides what are some essential operational 
parameters, these being the search track spacing, the search track 
width and the working speed of the vessel carrying the minehunting 
equipment. At the present time, the data that forms an input to the 
mission planning algorithms is obtained by a subjective assessment. 
As a result, the minehunting performance can frequently fall short of 
what should be possible with the systems available. The present invention was devised to provide a performance 
monitor apparatus which would be more effective in operation and 
which would be able to adapt itself to the continuously variable sea 
conditions which occur whilst it is in use. According to the invention, there is provided a performance 
monitor apparatus for a minehunting operation, the apparatus 
comprising probe means for gathering environmental data indicative 
of the variation of the velocity of sound and water temperature with 
depth relevant to 
minehunting performance, first data storage means for minehunting 
performance prediction algorithms, second data storage means for 
system/ship/mine target parameters, and performance prediction 
means capable of providing an output signal relevant to expected 
minehunting performance.  
 Preferably, the environmental data gathering means comprises 
a probe capable of being suspended at different depths in the water 
environment. A probe suspension means may comprise a cable 
which is carried on a jib assembly such that it may be unwound from 
a cable drum. The cable drum may be driven by a motor which is arranged 
for remote control operation. The apparatus may include a computer 
arranged to control data movements for the monitoring operation. By way of example, a particular embodiment of the invention 
will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which: 
Figure 1 is a general view of the performance monitor 
apparatus showing the portion mounted on the ship deck and an 
electronics unit,  Figure 2 is a block diagram showing the main units of the 
system, and, Figure 3 is a similar diagram showing an apparatus operator 
interface and the other interfaces involved. As
