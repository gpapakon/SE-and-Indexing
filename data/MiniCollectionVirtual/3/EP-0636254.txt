<ABSTRACT>
A high speed optical switching device (1) comprises a waveguide arrangement, incorporating a pn junction, with a large bondpad (11) for the purposes of increasing the capacitance presented by the device. Data and control signals can be input at an input port (8) of the waveguide arrangement, presence of the control signal operating to modify the optical path length of the device for the data signal. By incorporating the device in an interferometer arrangement, or by exploiting a Fabry-Perot cavity of the device, it can be used to transmit the data signal selectively, for instance so as to demultiplex a time multiplexed optical communications signal. The high capacitance provides very short recovery times so that data rates of 10 GHz and substantially above can be accomodated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical switching
devices and finds particular application in high bit rate
communications links.Communications links which can carry high data rates
are advantageous because they can transmit increased levels
of information and/or can provide links via a single
physical connection which service higher numbers of
customers. For instance, time division multiplexed signals
on a communications link can provide a higher number of
time slots, and potentially therefore service a higher
number of customers, where the link itself carries a higher
data rate.In order to access the data on a communications link,
it is necessary to down load the information on the link to
a receiver. In time division multiplexing, one particular
customer will require information from only one or more
selected time slots to be down loaded. To do this,
switching devices may be used, the speed of switching of
the device being commensurate with the capability of the
link for carrying high speed traffic. In optical
communications, it is envisaged that data rates may be
achieved as high as 100Gbit/s in the foreseeable future.
This might be carried in ten time slots, providing ten
channels at 10Gbit/s.As well as potentially increasing the number of
customers using a communications link, ultra high bit rate
links in future networks may enable customers to be offered
new large bandwidth services as well as giving
telecommunications companies greater flexibility in
managing their networks. The present invention is
concerned with an important part of achieving ultra high 
bit rate links, providing a type of switch capable of demultiplexing a 10Gbit/s bit
stream from a 100Gbit/s optical time division multiplexed (OTDM) signal. An
optical clock signal might be used to switch out every tenth bit. Hence, to
recover all the data on the link, ten switching devices might be used in parallel.Switching devices are known, including switching devices which can be
controlled by an optical input. For instance, in "130ps Recovery of All-optical
Switching in a GaAs Multi Quantum Well Directional Coupler" published in Applied
Physics Letters volume 58 number 19 on 13th May 1991 by Li Kam Wa et al
(Ref. (i)), a recovery time of 130ps is reported in a zero gap directional coupler
using multiple quantum wells. However, it has now been discovered in making
the present invention that much faster recovery times can be achieved. Reduced
recovery times provide potentially faster switches, recovery time being a limiting
factor. GB-A-2
