A process for the continuous production of sparingly
soluble metal hydroxides corresponding to the general

formula M
(x)
(OH)
x
, wherein M is Co, Zn, Ni or Cu and x
denotes the valency of the metal, characterised in

that in a first step a metal hydroxide obtained by
anodic oxidation of metal is reacted with a complexing

agent L in the presence of alkali metal salts AY to
form metal complex salt corresponding to the general

formula ML
n
Y
m
 and lye, and in a second step the metal
complex salt, by reaction with lye at pH values

of 
>
 7, is decomposed into sparingly soluble metal
hydroxides and complexing agent and alkali metal salt,

the complexing agent L and the alkali metal salt AY
being returned to a first step and the decomposition

of the metal complex salt being effected using the lye
formed in the first step.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that
ammonia or organic monoamines and/or diamines having a

chain length of from 1 to 6 are used as complexing
agent.
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the metal hydroxides are doped

with one or more of the elements Co, Zn, Mg, Ca and Cd
in a total quantity of up to 10 wt.%.
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it is carried out at

temperatures within the range of 30째C to 85째C,
preferably 45째C to 80째C.
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the decomposition of the metal

complex salts is effected in a highly turbulent flow,
which is produced by inte
nsive stirring, by passive or
active mixing units or by flow nozzles. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the decomposition is carried out

in a reactor for a defined residence time of from 0.5
to 10 hours, preferably from 1 to 4 hours.
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the production is carried out in

a loop reactor.
