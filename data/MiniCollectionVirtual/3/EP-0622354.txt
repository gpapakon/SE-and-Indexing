<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of N-acylaminophenols 
by the concurrent hydrogenation of a nitrophenol to an 

aminophenol and the acylation of the aminophenol with acyl 
anhydride takes place on a continuous basis in a stirred 

tank reactor in which liquid product is continuously 
withdrawn from the reactor. Of particular i
nterest is the 
manufacture of acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol by 

continuous reaction of p-ntirophenol, hydrogen and acetic 
anhydride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of N-acyl-aminophenols
by hydrogenation of nitrophenols to
aminophenols, and concurrently acylating the aminophenol.
The invention has particular use in forming N-acetyl-p-aminophenol
by hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol and concurrent
acetylation of the formed p-aminophenol as above described
in one step and on a continuous basis.The conventional process for the production of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol
involves reduction of p-nitrophenol to
produce p-aminophenol which is then acetylated to produce N-acetyl-p-aminophenol.
The reduction of p-nitrophenol to
produce p-aminophenol involves hydrogenating the p-nitrophenol
in the presence of catalysts such as platinum,
palladium, nickel, noble metal catalysts, or oxides of
platinum, palladium, or noble metal catalysts. Gaseous
hydrogen is commonly used as a reducing agent. The
acetylating agent is usually acetic anhydride. The reaction
medium can be acetic acid, water, a water-isopropanol
mixture, or other inert medium.The above described series of reactions has been
carried out simultaneously as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,076,030 and
U.S. Pat. No. 3,341,587. In the process described in both
of these simultaneous reaction patents, p-nitrophenol and
acetic anhydride are added at the beginning of the reaction
sequence, and the hydrogenation of the p-nitrophenol takes
place in the presence of acetic anhydride that is in excess
over the amount of p-aminophenol in the system at any given
moment. The one-step synthesis of APAP is advantageous in 
that such process avoids the need to isolate and purify the
p-aminophenol which is oxidatively unstable.The above reaction sequence has also been carried
on a step-wise manner in which the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol
is completed prior to the acetylation step.
This step-wise reaction scheme has been further refined in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,525 in which the hydrogenation step is
interrupted and acetylation accomplished followed by at
least one further hydrogenation step each of which is
followed by another acetylation step all the while keeping
the pH below about 7.0. In U.S. 4,670,589, at least 5% of
p-nitrophenol is first hydrogenated to p-aminophenol, and
then the remaining nitrophenol is hydrogenated while
concurrently acetylating p-aminophenol to N-acetyl-p-aminophenol
wherein, prior to hydrogenating 80% of the p-nitrophenol,
no molar excess of acetic anhydride is
provided.The step-wise reaction schemes described above are
cumbersome and are particularly difficult to operate on a
commercial
