<ABSTRACT>
A wiredrawing machine (10) consists of a plurality of 
stages (11) in cascade, each stage comprising a drawbench 

(13) for passage of the wire (14) partially passed over a 
power-driven traction pulley (12). The traction pulley is 

kinematically connected for operation to a first gear (17) 
having a power-driven planetary gear (19) meshing 

therewith and rotating about the first gear (17) 
periphery. Sensor means (23) detects the angular position 

of the planetary gear (19) about the axis of the first 
gear (17) and sends position signals to a control circuit 

(24) which in turn sends commands for speed adjustment to 
motor (16), in terms of keeping the planetary gear at 

predetermined angular positions about the first gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct-pull multistage
wiredrawing machine.Multistage wiredrawing machines are known in which the
wire to be drawn is successively passed through
drawbenches having decreasing sections. In order to avoid
tensions to be generated that would bring to the wire
breakage, it is necessary to keep the product of the wire
section by the wire speed constant. Therefore rollers are
generally used over which the wire length located between
two drawbenches is wrapped and which are driven in
rotation by electric motors operated in such a manner as
to produce the traction action necessary for that wire
length. Several different solutions have been proposed for
performing the function of adjusting the motors' speed.For example it has been proposed to carry out the motors'
adjustment (either manually or with the aid of automatic
or semiautomatic devices) so as to produce a torque
slightly lower than that necessary to start drawing. After
that, the last motor of the drawing machine is adjusted
for supplying a pulling action enabling the immediately
preceding motor to rotate, so that, in turn, the last
mentioned motor will produce a pulling action transmitted
to the motor immediately preceding it, and so on as far as
the whole drawing train is set in motion. Such a drawing
machine can be used only for working wires which are 
sufficiently big to withstand the pulling forces that are
generated during transient steps and which produce
spreading of "jerks" along the different stages.Also proposed have been wiredrawing machines having
sensors disposed along the wire lengths between the
rollers in order to detect the wire tension and drive the
motors so as to keep said tension to an acceptable value.Usually said sensors consist of feeler pins or takeup
rollers on which the wire rests and over which it is
wrapped. The sensor movement is converted to electric
signals piloting the speed control devices of the electric
motors. In addition to the mechanical complexity
introduced by the plurality of movable feeler pins or
takeup rollers disposed along the wire lengths, the
deformations imposed to the wire by such sensors in order
to be able to detect tensioning of same submit the wire to
undesired stresses."Storage" drawing machines have been also proposed in
which, in place of the speed control, wire storing means
is used for accumulating the wire between the different
drawing machines, so that stages are isolated from one
another as much as possible and spreading of pulls is
avoided. However,
