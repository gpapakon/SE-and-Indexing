<ABSTRACT>
Described are compounds of the formula (I), in which Hal is a halogen such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine; R1 is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl or C3-C7 cycloalkyl; R2 is hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl or C3-C7 cycloalkyl and R3 is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl, for use in a method of controlling fleas on pets, in particular dogs and cats. Systemic application is preferred. Application is carried out by administering an amount effective against fleas of a substance of the formula (I) via the digestive tract or the blood of the host animal, hence administering the substance systemically to the pet, particularly a dog or cat.
