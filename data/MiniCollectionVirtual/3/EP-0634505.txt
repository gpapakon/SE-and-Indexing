<DESCRIPTION>
Yarn produced from fibers of propylene polymer material.
More particularly, it relates to yarn and pile fabric such as
carpeting made therefrom, in which the fiber is based on
compositions comprising mixtures of isotactic and syndiotactic
crystalline polypropylene and crystalline and semi-crystalline
random copolymers of propylene with ethylene and C4-C8 alpha-olefins.In addition to its significant use in structural elements
such as molded parts, polypropylene has found significant use
as a fiber and in yarn, particularly carpet yarn. In order to
capitalize on its strength, high melting point and chemical
inertness, as well as low cost, the polymer typically used for
such applications has been the isotactic crystalline
homopolymer of polypropylene (referred to as "iPP"). However,
carpeting made from this polymer has limited recovery of the
pile height after compressive stress (resiliency) and tuft
ends which are susceptible to opening up after wear (tuft
coherency). Such performance deficiencies have limited its
use in domestic saxony type carpet construction. Earlier
attempts to improve isotactic polypropylene homopolymer
performance were made by modifying the method of crimping the
fibers comprising the yarn, U.S. 3,686,848.Fibers obtained from mechanical blends of homopolymers of
polypropylene and polyethylene are known; the thermoshrinkable
values of such fibers are good and not very temperature
dependent. However, such fibers have the disadvantage of not
being very wear-resistant, since they are prone to
"fibrillation": the single fiber, after having been subjected
to mechanical stress, when examined under a microscope shows
longitudinal tears. Such fibrillation is very evident during
the manufacture of carpets, and it makes such blends
undesirable for this use. The limited resiliency of polypropylene in carpeting and
other fiber/fabric applications is also discussed in "Textile
Science and Technology, Polypropylene Fibers-Science and
Technology" by M. Ahmed, (Elsevier Press). That reference
acknowledges that polypropylene based on commercial fibers is
considered intermediate in resilience characteristics between
polyester and nylon although "specially prepared fibers" may
surpass nylon and approach wool. The reference presents a
graph (Fig. 6) that shows resilience, as measured by pile
retention, affected by heat setting and draw ratio. It is
stated that "(t)here is general agreement that resilient fiber
must exhibit high crystalline orientation and high fraction of
a-axis oriented crystallites."A
