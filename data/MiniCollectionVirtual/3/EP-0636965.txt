<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for the management of graphs comprised of a high number 
of points without affecting the readability of the graph itself. The method 

and system also allow to keep in the computer memory a number of points 
greater than the number of points that can be shown in the assigned screen 

region.
 

Scrolling functions operate only on the part of the chart representing the 
data, without the involvement of other portions like legends, titles, 

scales, descriptions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and system for managing the display of 
data values and more particularly for managing a graphic representation of 
said data in an interactive workstation data processing system. Data representation is usually obtained by generalized programs that shield 
the programmer from the complexity needed to control the system components 
responsible for the graphics. In representing numeric values in graphic 
format it is usually possible to show any number of points by automatically 
determining the chart parameters (window dimensions, number of points to be 
displayed in the window, scale, representation format etc.), so as to include 
all of the data. There is also the need of showing data incoming from 
external devices like electronic equipment or computer networks. In many 
applications, particularly those related to the monitoring of values, an 
automatic refresh of the chart is needed any time a new value is available. It is known the use of scale modification functions to show the data in 
graphic format.
 
When new data are received and a refresh is needed, new points are added to 
the graph and the scale of the chart is reduced if the space needed is not 
available on the screen region assigned.
 
Such a method achieves the result of completely confining the chart in the 
screen region assigned to the graphic representation. This method, however 
has the obvious drawback of an uneasy reading when the points to be shown 
are numerous or the space assigned to the chart is small. Another known method saves the chart representation in a temporary memory 
portion and, by operating the scroll functions in the four orthogonal 
directions, it allows any desired part of the graph to be seen through the 
window delimited by the assigned region of screen. When new data are 
received they are added in the temporary memory portion and the whole graph 
has to be rebuilt.
 
This method, while allowing an easier reading when there are many points to 
be shown, has the drawback that a portion of the graph is not visible, and 
that said portion may contain important information for interpreting the  
 
graph itself such as, for example, the type and the description of the 
represented values.
 
Another drawback is the difficulty for the user to find and display a new 
desired part of the graph after the rebuilding of the old graph. It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the above 
drawbacks of the prior art. The invention as claimed allows the management of

<CLAIMS>
Method for managing display of numeric data in graphic format in a 
window-oriented data processing system, said numeric data being stored in 

the system and displayable according to the order in which they are 
received, the method comprising the steps of: 


creating a window, said window comprising the graphic lay-out and 
data definition; 
defining the number of said data to be displayed in said window; 
displaying said window and said data; 
creating a scroll bar having a portion the lenght of which is 
determined by the ratio between the number of said displayed data and the 

number of said stored data, the position of said portion controlling and 
indicating the position of said displayed data in respect of the totality 

of the available data; 
displaying said scroll bar; 
selecting the data to be displayed by scroll bar operation when the 
displayed data are less than the stored data, said scroll-bar operation not 

affecting the displaying of graphic lay-out and data definition. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the stored data are obtained from external 
sources and continuously updated and wherein upon receipt of new or updated 

data, the indications of scroll bar are modified accordingly. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 further comprising the step of: 

discarding the oldest numeric value stored in the system when, upon 
receipt of a new numeric value, the maximum storing capacity of the system 

is exceeded and storing said new numeric value. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3 further comprising the step of: 

automatically activating scroll operation upon receipt of a new 
numeric value, 
In a window-oriented data processing system, a system for managing display 
of numeric data in graphic format, said numeric data being stored in 

the system and displayable according to the order in which they are 
received, the system comprising: 


a window-oriented operating system for creating and managing windows, 
the windows comprising the graphic lay-out and data definition; 
means for defining the number of said data to be displayed in said 
window; 
display means for displaying said window and said data; 
means for creating and displaying a scroll bar having a portion the 
lenght of which is determined by the ratio between the number of said 

displayed data and the number of said stored data, the position of said 
portion controlling and indicating the position of said displayed data in 

respect of the totality of the available data; 
means for selecting the data to be displayed by scroll bar operation 
when the displayed data are less than the stored data, said scroll-bar 

operation not affecting the displaying of graphic lay-out and data 
 

definition. 
The system of claim 5 further comprising: 

means for receiving and continuously updating the stored data from 
external sources; and 
means for modifying the indications of scroll bar according to the 
newly received or upated data. 
The system of claim 5 or 6 further comprising: 

means for discarding the oldest numeric value stored in the system 
when, upon receipt of a new numeric value, the maximum storing capacity of 

the system is exceeded and storing said new numeric value. 
The system of claim 5, 6 or 7 further comprising: 

means for automatically activating scroll operation upon receipt of 
a new numeric value.
