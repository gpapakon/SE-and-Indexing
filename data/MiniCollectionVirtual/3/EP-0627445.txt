<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to protein purification technology. 
In particular, the invention relates to a process for the 
purification of water-soluble forms of penicillin binding protein 
2a (PBP 2a) of Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus resistance to methicillin, a 
semisynthetic penicillin, was first reported in 1961 (Barber, 
1961, J. Clin. Pathol. 14:383-393), shortly after the antibiotic 
was introduced. Occurrences of methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
(MRSA) infections were rare until the 1980's. However, since that 
time the incidence of nosocomial infections by MRSA and other 
methicillin-resistant staphylococci species has been increasing 
and is now considered a world-wide health concern (Neu, 1992, 
Science 257:1064-1073. Resistance to methicillin has been attributed to PBP 2a, a 
product of the Staphylococcus aureus mecA gene, which was first 
characterized by Matsuhashi et al., 1986, J. Bacteriol. 196:3508-3514. 
PBP 2a, a membrane bound protein, putatively functions as a 
transpeptidase for cell-wall biosynthesis in the presence of β-lactam 
antibiotics. 
Wu et al., 1992, Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother. 36:533-539, 
described the construction of plasmid pEWSA30 which expressed a 
PBP 2a variant from Staphylococcus aureus strain 27r in 
Escherichia coli. This PBP 2a variant is devoid of the region 
encoding the putative transmembrane domain. Thus, E. coli DH5α 
cells transformed with pEWSA30 produced PBP 2a as a soluble 
protein when grown on a solid medium. There have been reports of the purification of other PBPs. A 
soluble variant of penicillin binding protein 2x (PBP 2x) from 
Streptococcus pneumoniae expressed in Escherichia coli was 
described by Laible et al., 1992, Eur. J. Biochem. 207:943-949. 
Laible et al. purified small amounts of the variant S. pneumoniae 
PBP 2x by dye-ligand chromatography followed by an anion exchange  
 
on Mono Q. Mottl and Keck (Protein Expr. Purif. 3:403-409 (1992)) 
described the use of dye-ligand chromatography in protein 
purification, in particular PBP 4 of E. coli. Compounds having high affinity for PBP 2a would have 
substantial therapeutic value as antibiotics against MRSA. The 
structure/function based design of antibiotic compounds useful 
against staphylococcal infections is dependent upon the ability to 
characterize the binding domains of penicillin binding proteins 
produced by methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. The 
characteristics of such potential antibiotic binding sites can be 
determined by x-ray crystallography,
