<ABSTRACT>
An infrared optical part, such as a prism consisting of synthetic diamond and capable of carrying out an ATR spectroscopic 
analysis of a sample to be measured, which is deposited on an object in a place in bad environment, a structure or clothes, by 

merely bringing the prism into pressure contact with these objects, and a sample holding slide plate, which consists of synthetic 
diamond and has a long useful life, for an infrared microscope; and a measuring instrument using this prism. Since a total reflection 

(ATR) prism (14) of synthetic diamond the crystals of which have a nitrogen content of not more than 3 ppm and a boron 
content of not more than 3 ppm, optical mirrors (12, 17), lenses (13, 16) or 
fibers are used, a total reflection (ATR) spectroscopic 
analysis of a sample is carried out by bringing the prism into direct pressure contact with the sample (15) without using a holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical parts
primarily for use in infrared spectral analysis and, more
particularly, to an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) prism
capable of measuring ATR spectra only by bringing the prism
into pressure contact with a measuring object.In a conventional infrared ATR spectrometer, first,
with the use of a prism 1 as shown in Fig. 1, a sample 2
processed into a thin piece is put into contact with a prism
surface 3, on which measuring light 4 is made incident.
Then, upon total reflection of the light by an interface 3
between the sample and the prism, there occurs a penetration
which causes an absorption unique to the sample. By
measuring the spectrum of transmitted light 5 that has
undergone the absorption is measured, the sample and
impurities contained therein are measured. It is to be
noted that details of this method is as described in
"Development of Transparent Optical Parts for Large Output
CO2 Laser," by Takeo Miyata.Conventionally, as the material of this prism 1 for
infrared ATR spectral analysis, such substances as shown in
Table 1 have been available. As the material of the prism
1, among other natural diamonds, the optimum one is that
designated type IIa, that exhibits no absorption in the
infrared region. 
However, as shown in Table 1, conventionally available
substances except diamonds have had some problems such as:
(1) narrow transmission region; (2) toxic; (3) liable to
damage; and (4) deliquescent.On account of the above defects, it has hitherto been
quite difficult to conduct measurement in non-air-conditioned,
poor-environment rooms, or at any places
outdoors. Moreover, their insufficiency in durability or
strength would make it difficult to push the prism into
direct contact with the sample itself for measurement, which
required the sample to be formed into a thin piece and put
into contact with the prism by using a special holder.On the other hand, whereas diamonds have almost no
defects in terms of material quality, the type suitable for
infrared spectral analysis among diamonds is the one so
called type IIa that shows no absorption in the infrared
region. This type of diamond is as small in quantity as 1-2%
of the total yield of natural diamonds, such that those
of large size as much as several millimeters enough to be
used for prisms are very rare in yield, almost unavailable
in actual cases.The present invention consists in an infrared optical
part which comprises an attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
prism, made from a synthetic diamond
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An infrared optical part which comprises an
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) prism (33, 43, 54), made

from a synthetic diamond having a nitrogen content of not
more than 3 ppm and a boron content of not more than 3 ppm

contained in the crystal, the prism having a surface (3)
adapted to be placed in contact with a sample and an

incident surface through which incident light can be
directed onto the sample and reflected therefrom,

characterised in that the prism has a transmitting surface
or surfaces (43) so configured that incident light reflected

from the sample can pass straight out through said
transmitting surface or surfaces without total internal

reflection.
An infrared optical part as claimed in claim 1
wherein an incident surface or transmitting surface of the

prism (43) is covered with a plurality of surfaces (44)
having no attenuated total reflection property, thereby

reducing loss of incident light (41) and transmitted light
(47).
An infrared optical part as claimed in claim 1
wherein a substance (53) with a diamond-equivalent

refractive index is surface-processed into a curved surface
to reduce reflection loss of incident light and transmitted

light of the prism, and put on the synthetic diamond prism
(54) in close contact therewith.
A measuring instrument which comprises a prism 
(33, 43, 54) as defined in any one of claims 1 to 3, and, in

combination therewith, an optical-use mirror (46,52,56),
lens (42), or fiber (32, 35), whereby attenuated total

reflection (ATR) spectral analysis can be carried out by
pushing the prism into direct contact with a sample (34,45,

55) without using a holder or the like.
