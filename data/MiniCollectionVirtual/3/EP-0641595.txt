<ABSTRACT>
The dismantleable agitator is made up of a drive shaft (1) and an agitation rotor (2) separable when stopped. The self-holding taper between the end (8) of the shaft and the hub (6) of the rotor (2) is of the inverted-cone conical type. The coupling and the separation are made possible by virtue of the alternation of shaft-hub release surfaces (10, 11 and 12) and (22, 23 and 24) which are set back and a number of male bearing surfaces (13, 14 and 15) projecting on the shaft and of female bearing surfaces (19, 20 and 21) which are opposite and of recesses (22, 23 and 24) on the hub coming into locking contact one over the other after the movements of insertion, of rotation and of lift-off during the assembling. A safety edge (25) introduced into one of the recesses after assembling provides an additional locking safety if necessary.
