<ABSTRACT>
A film is provided for producing a dye diffusion thermal transfer image comprising diffusible dyes physically located in the pores of a porous film having a pore size between 20 and 400 Gurlex without any binder. The diffusion of dyes can be carried out at low energy and, thus, the service life of the thermal head can be extended. The film further posses high thermal sensitivity and high gradation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a binder-less 
porous donor for producing a dye diffusion thermal 
transfer image. A dye diffusion thermal transfer system is 
broadly used because it can produce an image in a 
completely dry process with a non-impact system using 
digitalized image information, the produced image 
having a high continuous gradation. In this system, 
image formation has hitherto been carried out by 
bringing a donor layer comprised of dyes and a 
macromolecular binder fixed on a donor substrate film 
in contact with a receptor layer on which an image is 
to be formed, bringing a thermal head into contact with 
the surface of the donor substrate film opposite the 
surface on which donor layer is placed, diffusing the 
dyes in the donor layer onto the receptor layer 
perpendicularly to the surface of the receptor layer by 
the thermal energy supplied from the thermal head, and 
then fixing the dyes thereon. This system is 
schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Such systems are disclosed, for example, in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 3-13386, 
3-65394, 3-65395, and 3-86589. In conventional 
films using binders, a high affinity between the dyes 
and the binder is required in order to sufficiently 
diffuse the dyes in the donor layer. If the affinity 
is high, a high thermal energy is required for 
diffusing the dyes into the receptor layer. An energy 
threshold of diffusion of the dyes also exists. Thus, 
it is difficult to form an image having both a high  
 
continuous gradation and a high optical density at a 
low thermal energy. US 4 847 144 discloses a film suitable for producing a dye diffusion 
thermal transfer image comprising dyes localized in pores of a porous ink 
layer comprising a binder which is a thermofusible material solid at room 
temperature.  
 Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
donor film that allows the dyes to be diffused at a low 
thermal energy, entails no energy threshold to the 
thermal diffusion of dyes, and is capable of forming an 
image having a high continuous gradation even in a wide 
optical density range. In accordance with the present invention, a 
donor layer is formed by physically locating 
diffusible dyes in the pores of a porous film having a 
pore size between 20 and 400 Gurley. By eliminating 
the need for a binder, the porous film of the present 
invention allows the dyes contained therein to be 
diffused onto the receptor layer at a low thermal 
energy without entailing any thermal threshold. Thus, the present invention
