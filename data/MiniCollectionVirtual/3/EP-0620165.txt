<ABSTRACT>
The tubular container (1) comprises a multi-layer film (3), which is made up of a metal foil (3c) and at least one outer plastic film (3a). The outer plastic film (3a) has a region of weakness (4), acting as a predetermined breaking point, which is produced by thermal action. The region of weakness (4) reduces the mechanical strength of the multi-layer film (3) as a whole, so that opening aids of a processing device are able to open the tubular container (1) reliably at this point.

<CLAIMS>
Tubular bag of a composite foil (3) with a metal foil (3c) and at 
least one externally placed plastic foil (3a), comprising at the 

end a narrow defined opening area (4) which can be pierced 
open, 
characterised in that
 the pierceable opening area (4) is 
a thermally produced weakened area serving as a nominal 

breaking point in the externally placed plastic foil (3a), and the 
externally placed plastic foil (3a) in the weakened area remains 

undamaged and its wall thickness essentially unchanged. 
Tubular bag according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
weakened area (4) is pointed. 
Tubular bag according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
weakened area is in the shape of a line. 
Tubular bag according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
weakened area is ringshaped. 
Tubular bag according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the weakened area is placed in the area of a closure clip 
(2).
