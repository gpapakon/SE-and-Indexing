<DESCRIPTION>
 MOUNTING AND TENSIONING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SCREENSThis invention relates to screens and to screen mounting and tensioning arrangements in screening apparatus for use, for example, in the separation of solids from a slurry.In known vibratory screening apparatus, a sheet of woven mesh material is disposed between laterally spaced support members extending fore-and-aft with respect to the direction of travel of the material to be screened. The mesh material is effectively mounted or carried on the support members. The mesh must be placed under tension to obtain an effective screening action.One presently popular mounting and tensioning arrangement is shown in United Kingdom Patent Specification No. 1326133 (FMC Corporation) in which the fore-and-aft extending side edge portions of a mesh screen unit are reinforced with sheet metal strip material folded to define a hook configuration as viewed in cross-section and cooperable with similarly configured tensioners shiftable by means of a plurality of screw adjusters spaced along the side edges of the screen unit. When the screen unit is installed and the mesh material tensioned, the mesh is pulled against a set of mutually parallel laterally-spaced support bars which extend fore-and-aft between the support members and serve to sub-divide the full lateral span of the mesh. Usually, these support 

bars are disposed to lie not in the plane common to that containing the tensioners. Thus, the mesh surfaces define a cambered configuration. A similar arrangement is shown in United States Patent Specification No. 4846352 (Bailey) , but in which the mesh is first tensioned by laterally shiftable tensioners along the edges of the screen unit and then further tensioned and clamped by inflatable support bars adapted to shift against the mesh in a direction normal to its surface.A principal disadvantage of these prior proposals is that several mutually independent screw adjusters make it time-consuming to apply tension to a screen unit, are difficult to use in certain environments such as oil rigs, and are prone to problems attributable to corrosion and seizing of screw-threaded elements. The secondary tensioning using the inflatable support bars shown in United States Patent Specification No. 4846352 has a desirable feature of rapid action, but depends upon the accuracy of the primary tensioning to avoid distortion of the mesh which distortion can seriously impair the screening performance. A disadvantage of inflatable or shiftable support bars for tensioning is that

CLAIMS
1. Screening apparatus comprising substantially mutually parallel and laterally spaced side support members (11, 12) extending in a fore-and-aft direction, a screen unit (10) having a flexible mesh material (10A) extending between the support members (11, 12) , relatively rigid holding means (13, 14) engaging side edge portions of the mesh material (10A) along the fore-and-aft dimension thereof, pulling means (15) disposed along at least one support member (11) and connected to the holding means (13, 14) of at least one side edge portion of the mesh material (10A) and operable to pull this holding means (13, 14) towards the adjacent support member (11), and support bars (20) extending fore-and-aft between the support members (11, 12) and shiftable normally to the general plane of the mesh material (10A) for supporting the latter; characterised in that actuating means (17, 18) is arranged to operate the pulling means (15) to shift the holding means (13, 14) for the said one side edge portion of the mesh material (10A) to a fixed location relative to said adjacent support member (11) before the support bars (20) are to be shifted, said fixed location being set with reference to a predetermined width dimension (W) of the screen unit (10) so that the mesh material (10A) is pulled out evenly by the pulling means (15) .
2. Screening apparatus according to claim 1; 


characterised in that the said fixed location is set with reference to a predetermined width dimension (W) of the screen unit (10) so that the mesh material (10A) is pulled out evenly taut by the pulling means (15) .
3. Screening apparatus according to claims l or 2; characterised in that said actuating means (17, 18) is arranged to operate the pulling means (15) in a single-action or unison manner.
4. Screening apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims; characterised in that the pulling means (17, 18) comprises one or more actuators (18) operable by means of fluid under pressure, said one or more actuators (18) being connected to a single source of fluid under pressure by way of a control valve means (18B) .
5. Screening apparatus according to claim 4; characterised in that the one or more actuators (18) is/are pneumatic actuators.
6. Screening apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims; characterised in that the holding means (13, 14) comprises for each side of the mesh material (10A) a longitudinally slit tube (13), and rib means (14) secured to the side edge portion of the mesh material (10A) and received within the tube (13) with the mesh material (10A) extending through the slit of the tube (13) .
7. Screening apparatus according to claim 6; characterised in that said rib means (14) comprises several mutually separate rib elements arranged in a 


series along the mesh edge portion.
8. Screening apparatus according to claim 6 or 7; characterised in that the rib means (14) is of moulded construction formed in a mould or die cavity (25) by a settable material flowed around the mesh material edge portion.
9. Screening apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 8; characterised in that the rib means (14) is made of a flexible or pliable material.
10. Screening apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 9; characterised in that the rib means (14) is of circular cross-sectional configuration.
11. Screening apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims; characterised in that the pulling means (15) comprises several rods (15) which extend through respective openings (16) in the support member (11) , the inner end of each rod (15) being attached to the adjacent holding means (13, 14), and the outer end of each rod (15) being coupled to the actuating means (17, 18).
12. Screening apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims; characterised in that said fixed location is the location of the holding means (13, 14) when the latter abuts the support member (11) over the full fore-and-aft length of the holding means (13, 14).
13. A screen unit for use in screening apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, the screen unit comprising a sheet of mesh material (10A) having mutually 


substahtially parallel side edges, and rib means (14) attached to each one of said side edges for holding the mesh material (10A) ; characterised in that each rib means (14) is of moulded construction formed in a mould or die cavity (25) by a settable material flowed around the respective side edge portion of the mesh material (10A) to enclose said side edge portion, and comprises several mutually separate rib elements arranged in a series along the mesh edge portions.
14. A screen unit according to claim 13; characterised in that the rib means (14) is made of a pliable or flexible 
'
 material.
15. A screen unit according to claim 13 or 14; characterised in that the rib means (14) is of circular cross-sectional configuration.
