<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shoe which contains a flexible shaft (1) with shaft parts (1a, 1b) which can be braced in relation to one another in the instep region and with a heel cap (4, 24) provided towards the rear as well as, supported by the shaft (1), a rotary clamping closure (5) with a clamping cable (9) which can be wound up onto and unwound from a cable pulley (7) with the effect of mutual drawing together and loosening of the shaft parts. A particularly favourable arrangement of the rotary closure in terms of manufacturing as well as a particularly good drawing together of the corresponding shaft parts (1a, 1b) is achieved by the heel cap (4, 24) being designed in its central rear region with a raised extension section (13) for firm reception of the rotary clamping closure (5).
