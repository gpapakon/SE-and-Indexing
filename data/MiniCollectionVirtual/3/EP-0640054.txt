<ABSTRACT>
A cap (26) and container (10) combination wherein the cap (26) fits about the container (10) in at least two closure positions. Two circumferential bands (29, 30) are provided around the skirt (28) of the cap (26) and there is an internal thread (31) which engages an external thread about the container neck (13). In the first position, one band of the cap (26) engages a circumferential slot (21) about the container (10). The internal thread seals with the top of the container (10). The first band (29) is removed and the container opened by removing the cap. In the second position, the second band (30) engages the slot and the threads engage each other. In the second position, the second band (30) is located about the container (10). It remains in position when and after the cap (26) is removed. Tampering of the container (10) and cap (26) can be visually detected with this configuration. A bead (19) about the container (10) is formed of a reduced cross-section in portions circumferentially around the cap (26). This facilitates assembly and disassembly of cap (26) and container (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article comprising a cap and container,
particularly to an article comprising
a tamper evident cap and container for sample and specimen
collections for medical purposes.Cap-container configurations which are tamper proof are
increasingly important for modern society. This is particularly
the case where the container is to contain medical samples or
medical products.Different kinds of cap-container combinations are known.
Unfortunately most of these do not provide easy use to the
medical laboratory technicians or patients. Moreso, they are
also generally relatively complex to manufacture. Evidence of
tampering can often be disguised in many of the known cap-container
configurations.There is a need to provide a tamper evident cap-container
which minimizes drawbacks in such known configurations.US-A-4805792 discloses a litterless tamper indicating
closure in which an extension of the skirt of the closure cap has
lines of weakening and at a lower end thereof an anchoring band
which can permanently anchor the cap to the container.By the present invention there is provided a dual operation
cap-container which is a considerable improvement over known
tamper proof configurations.The present invention provides an article comprising a cap
and a container, the container including a neck and a mouth, and
the cap including a top face and a skirt, characterised in that
the cap is receivable on the container in at least two different
closure positions with the skirt over the neck; the cap having
a first means and a second means, the container having a primary
engaging element and a secondary engaging element, and wherein
in a first closure position the primary engaging element and the
first means interact and the secondary engaging element is
substantially free of interaction with the cap; and in a second 
closure position the primary engaging element and the second
means interact and the secondary engaging element interacts in
a mating relationship with the cap.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
cap has a first band and a second band, the bands being
circumferentially arranged around the skirt, and above the second
band there is an internal threaded formation which engages an
externally threaded formation about the neck of the container.
Engagement is effected when the cap is mounted on the container.
In a first position the first band is located in a slot and the
internal threads of the cap engage the cap rim about the neck of
the container to effect a sealing
