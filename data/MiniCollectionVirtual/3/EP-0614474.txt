<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric compositions made from arylcyclobutene
containing monomers and methods for preventing autoxidation of said polymers.Arylcyclobutene monomeric compositions are useful in preparing thermoset and
thermoplastic polymeric compositions. Such polymeric compositions are highly desirable
because they exhibit hydrophobicity, excellent thermal stability, chemical resistance and
electrical insulative properties. Such polymeric compositions typically can exhibit thermal
degradation temperatures above 300°C, are insoluble in many organic solvents and in water
and have dielectric constants of less than 3.0 at 1 MHz. Therefore, they find uses as films,
coatings, adhesives and as interlayer dielectrics in multichip modules and other multilayer
electronic circuits.Johnson et al. disclose in IEEE Transactions On Components, Hybrids, and
Manufacturing Technology, Vol. 13, No. 2, June, 1990, that a polymer of

1,3-bis(2-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-3-ylethenyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane(hereinafter
DVS), available as a partially polymerized solution in mesitylene from The Dow Chemical
Company as Cyclotene 3022® (hereinafter partially thermally polymerized DVS or DVS
prepolymer) may be used as an interlayer dielectric to construct thin film multichip modules.
The partially thermally polymerized DVS may be applied by spin coating a solution of a
prepolymer onto a substrate, evaporating the solvent and then polymerizing by heating to
250°C for one hour in nitrogen. Catalysts and/or initiators are not required for the
polymerization. When exposed to air arylcyclobutene polymers undergo oxidation. At elevated
temperatures the oxidation is accelerated. When the polymer oxidizes, its electrical insulating
properties are degraded. Oxidation may lead to a yellow discoloration of the polymer, and in
severe cases to an amber color even in thin films.One may encapsulate the aryicyclobutene polymer by forming an oxygen barrier
around it. However, this adds costly steps to a fabrication process. Barrier coatings are also
subject to breakage and/or cracking, particularly under thermal cycling, which leads to loss of
the barrier protection.To preserve optical clarity and important electrical properties such as low
dielectric constant and low water uptake without the use of hermetic packaging or barrier
coatings, it would be advantageous to have an arylcyclobutene polymer composition that is less
susceptible to oxidation when exposed to air.The invention is a composition containing a compound
