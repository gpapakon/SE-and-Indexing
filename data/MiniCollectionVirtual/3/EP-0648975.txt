<ABSTRACT>
THE DOMESTIC EXOTHERMIC REACTOR FOR THE COMBUSTION OF GAS 
OIL GASES
 incorporates two chambers. A cylindrical inner chamber formed by an 
element 1 and an outer chamber formed by such element 1 and the housing 4. The fuel 

arrives to the inner chamber and backs up at a concave bottom 2 where it evaporates due 
to the heat therefore producing an ascending flow which is interfered by two deflector 

rings 7 and 8. The upper ring supports a central element formed by two perforated plates 
16 and 17, which in turn support the reticulated tubular elements 18, 19 and 20 ending on 

a head 24 and which warm the evaporating gases which initiate their combustion by means 
of the air supply to the outer chamber through an orifice 6 and which reaches the inner 

part of the reactor through rows of orifices 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. The invention can be 
applied to industrial and domestic stoves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a domestic exothermic reactor for the combustion of gas oil 
gases. The gas oil evaporates at room temperature by adding hot air until a perfect 
combustion is achieved within the reactor where the evaporation cycle, the mixture of fuel 
and comburent and the combustion take place on a continuous basis with the purpose of 
delivering the temperature outside to heat an area by radiation and thermal convection. The reactor which is the object of the invention cannot be defined as a burner since its 
purpose, instead, is not to initiate a mere combustion which takes from the atmosphere the 
necessary air to burn leaving - along with the flame - unburnt gases which become 
environmentally dangerous smokes and noxious for living creatures due to their poisonous 
nature. In accordance with the invention, a tank stores at room temperature the gas oil which is 
spilled under control by means of a feeder. The temperature increases by hundred per cent 
when the gas oil reaches the feeder and such temperature increases further in the reactor 
thus evaporating the gas oil staggeredly and burning as it evaporates so that when the 
threshold temperature is reached a greater gasification and simultaneous combustion occurs 
while the gases ascend through the reactor and, once they are completely burnt, disappear 
providing the desired heat. The inventor is not in possession of the technical literature related to the previous state-of-the-art 
but he is aware of the prior technology and the problems it poses as a consequence 
of an incomplete combustion, since it is based on simple burners which do even need an 
asbestos roving where the flame is directly set. The roving is fed by capillarity and 
determines the kind of combustion which only produces flames with the most volatile gases  
 
wasting the energetic power of the gas oil along with the carbon and sulphur compounds 
to finally obtain a temperature around 200° to 300° C, i.e. well below the real capacities 
of gas oil. An evidence of the rudimentary technique applied until now is the fact that where a gas 
oil stove used there is no need to verify whether it is lighted or not. It suffices to smell 
because an incomplete combustion transfers polluting compounds to the detriment of the 
atmosphere. Obviously, there are different burners available in the market due to the fact that there also 
is an offer of feeders based on different principles although the most widely used are those 
incorporating a vertical slot, i.e. those

chamber which supplies atmosphere air to the inner chamber receiving the fuel from the 
feeder. It is characterized because the inner chamber incorporates two deflector elements 

formed by two trunco-conical rings of which the upper one supports and secures a central 
element which interferes the ascending flow and distributes it radially towards the wall of 

the reactor which presents four protruding peripheral recesses of a dihedral shape and 
incorporate orifices communicating the outer and the inner chamber. Orifices have also 

been foreseen outside the protruding recesses located between the recess closer to the 
orifice of the inner chamber and the orifice of the chamber.

a six to seven ratio between the height and the diameter and between the inner chamber 
wall and the outer chamber wall. From a lateral point of view, there is a distance of one 

tenth of the diameter of the inner chamber while the distance between the bottom of both 
chambers is twice the distance between the walls.

incorporates orifices that perforate such ring in radial orbits with a difference between the 

outer one and the intermediate one double to the difference between the intermediate one 
and the inner one so that the number of orifices reduces the mass of the deflector or upper 

ring by one tenth compared with the lower one leaving between the central ring opening

deflector ring.
