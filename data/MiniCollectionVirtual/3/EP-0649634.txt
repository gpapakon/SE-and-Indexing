<ABSTRACT>
A trocar (100) wherein the cannula (28) can derive a varying 
length. The cannula contains a distal portion (32) and a 

proximal portion (30). The distal portion is retractable with 
respect to the proximal portion. Generally, the distal 

portion retracts around the outside of the proximal 
portion. There is disposed a sealing (34) between the distal 

and proximal portions, to allow for sealing of the 
proximal portion wall with respect to the puncture cite, 

to enhance insufflation. There is further disclosed a 
mechanism which causes the distal portion to lock with 

respect to the proximal portion. Furthermore, the 
obturator contains a latching mechanism (70) which mates with 

the distal portion. When the obturator is retracted, this 
latching mechanism may be actuated by an actuation 

mechanism (64) contained in the handle (60) of the obturator.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally this invention relates to trocars. More
specifically, this invention relates to trocars which have
cannulas wherein one portion of the cannula is capable of
moving, and thereby being retracted with respect to another
portion of the cannula.Trocars are instruments which are insertable into the
abdomen of a patient. In their most basic sense, trocars
contain a obturator, which is a rigid shaft generally
containing a puncturing mechanism able to pierce tissue.
This obturator is placed within a hollow cannula, which
consists of a lumen which is disposed about the obturator
shaft during insertion into tissue, Thereafter, the
obturator may be removed and the hollow interior section of
the cannula be exposed. Thereafter surgical instruments
can be placed within the cannula so that endoscopic or
laparoscopic surgery can take place.In the use of such trocars, it is realized that it may
be desirable to allow for adjustment of the cannula within
the abdominal wall. That is, abdominal walls vary in
thickness from patient to patient, and indeed even in the
same patient. Moreover, even with a constant thickness of
a patient's abdominal wall, it may be desirable to adjust
the relative position of the cannula within the abdominal
wall, so that the distal end of the cannula lies a pre-determined
distance from the end of the abdominal wall.
Devices have been developed such as that disclosed by US-A-5236424
in which a catheter comprises a retractable
cannula. The retractable cannula allows simple adjustment
of the position of the distal end within the body of a
patient. However no such device has been developed to
assist the positioning of a trocar within the body of the
patient. For instance, if one desires to operate in or near 
the mesentery, just below the abdominal wall, it would be
favourable for the cannula distal end to be disposed only to
the extent that it is placed at the abdominal or just even
with the abdominal wall.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to
create a trocar with a cannula wherein the cannula can be
made to assume a varying length. This is possible in a
trocar comprising a cannula for use with an obturator which
contains a distal portion and a proximal portion extending
therefrom. The distal portion is retractable with respect
to the proximal portion. The trocar further comprises an
obturator insertable into said cannula, the obturator
comprising a mechanism for retracting said distal portion
with respect to said proximal portion. Generally, the
distal portion retracts around

<CLAIMS>
A trocar (100) comprising:

a cannula (28) for use with an obturator (66), said
cannula (28) having a proximal portion (30) and a distal

portion (32) extending therefrom, wherein said distal
portion (32) is retractable with respect to said proximal

portion (30) and
an obturator (66) insertable into said cannula (28),
said obturator (66) comprising a latching mechanism (70) for

retracting said distal portion (32) with respect to said
proximal portion (30).
The trocar (100) of claim 1 further comprising a
locking mechanism (48) capable of locking said proximal (30)

and distal (32) portions with respect to one another.
The trocar (100) of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said
distal portion (32) and said proximal portion (30) have a

seal (34,36) disposed between one another.
The trocar (100) of any preceding claim comprising
an actuator mechanism (64) for actuating said latching

mechanism (70).
The trocar (100) of claim 4 comprising a cannula
handle (20) from which said cannula (28) extends and an

obturator handle (60) from which said obturator (66)
extends, and said latching mechanism (70) attached to said

obturator.
The trocar (100) of claim 5 wherein said actuation
mechanism (64) is attached to said obturator handle (60).
