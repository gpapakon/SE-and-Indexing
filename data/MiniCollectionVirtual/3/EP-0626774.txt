<ABSTRACT>
When a caller making a collect call encounters a busy called party or 
one that does not answer after a prescribed time, the telephone network offers the 

caller the opportunity to store a voice message in a messaging system at no charge to 
the caller (207). After the caller stores a message (211), one or more attempts are 

made to establish a connection between the messaging system and the called party's 
telephone (303). This may be done by periodically alerting the called party's 

telephone when it is in an on-hook state. When the called party answers, e.g., by 
going off-hook, the messaging system informs the called party that a collect voice 

message awaits him and asks if he is willing to pay to receive same (309). If the 
called party signals that he is willing to pay to receive the voice message (311), the 

messaging system plays the stored voice message from the collect caller (313) and 
signals the telephone network to charge the account of the called party for supplying 

the message (315). If the called party signals that he is unwilling to pay to receive 
the voice message, the message is not delivered (317).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of collect calls.In the telephone network today, many collect calls go uncompleted. The reason
for this often is that the call is unacknowledged by the called party, i.e., the called party is
busy or does not answer. Thus, there is a loss of revenue to the telephone companies
which cannot charge for these uncompleted calls.It is known that an unacknowledged non-collect call can be routed to a messaging
systems that serves the called party. If a call is so routed, the caller pays for the time that
he speaks to the messaging system as if the call was completed to the called party.EP-A-0 480 622 discloses an apparatus for use in processing a collect call
according to the preamble of claim 1, a method of processing a collect call according to
the preamble of claim 7, and a method for use in a telephone network according to the
preamble of claim 9.EP-A-0 480 622 discloses an automated operator position. If a telephone call is
not completed, the automated operator system will provide the caller with the opportunity
to leave a voice message. In the case of a collect call, however, the caller is only able to
leave a voice message if they agree to pay for it. If the caller does not agree to pay to
leave a voice message, the automated operator system simply disconnects the call.US-A-4 933 966 discloses a method for completing a collect call, in which the
caller's name is recorded and played to the called party, to assist the called party in
deciding whether to accept the collect call.A first aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus for use in processing
a collect call as claimed in claim 1.A second aspect of the present invention provides a method of processing a
collect call as claimed in claim 7.A third aspect of the present invention provides a method for use in a telephone
network as claimed in claim 9.Preferred features of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. We have recognized that for an unacknowledged collect call, even if a
messaging system is available to serve the called party, the caller can not leave a
message because he cannot or will not pay the charges for the call connection to the
messaging system. To overcome this problem, we extend the concept of collect
calling to messaging, thereby yielding "collect messaging". In accordance with the
principles of the invention, when a collect call is unacknowledged, e.g., it encounters
a busy called party or one that does not answer after a prescribed time, the telephone
network offers the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for use in processing a collect call, the apparatus comprising:

means for determining that a collect call placed by a caller to a called party is
unacknowledged;
means for recording a message from said caller; and
means for supplying said message to said called party;

   
characterised in that
 the means for supplying the message to the called party is
adapted to supply the message to the called party only in response to an indication that

said called party agrees to pay to receive said message;

   and 
in that
 the apparatus further comprises means, responsive to said indication,
for charging said called party for being supplied with said message.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 further including means for informing said
called party that said message awaits him and that said message will be supplied to said

called party if said called party agrees to pay to receive it.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said message includes a voice
message.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said message includes a video
message.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said message includes a facsimile
message.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said message includes a data message.
A method of processing a collect call from a caller to a called party, the method
comprising the steps of: 


identifying a received call as a collect call;
determining that said called party is unavailable; and
storing a message for said collect call;

   
characterised in that
 it further comprises the step of delivering the message to said
called party only if said called party agrees to pay a required fee to receive said message.
A method as defined in claim 7 further including the step of:

   announcing to said caller that a message may be stored for delivery to said called
party and that said message will be delivered only if said called party agrees to pay a

required fee to receive said message.
A method for use in a telephone network, the method comprising the steps of:

determining that a message is stored for delivery to a telephone line presently
corresponding to a particular telephone number;
alerting a telephone terminating said telephone number; and
receiving an indication that said telephone is answered;
the method being 
characterised in that
 it comprises the further steps of
announcing that a message is stored and can be retrieved if a required fee is paid; and
supplying said message to said telephone only if a response to said announcement
indicates that said required fee will be paid.
A method as defined in claim 9 further including the step of:

   deactivating said message if a response to said announcement indicates that said
required fee will not be paid.
