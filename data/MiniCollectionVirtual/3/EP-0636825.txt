<ABSTRACT>
Connection takes place by means of an external bell socket (3) connected to the pipe (1), and acting as a heat shield and inserted into an orifice (4) made in the wall of the member (2), and   (a) the orifice (4) includes an internal step (5) lined with an annular seal (6) and is externally and at least partially surrounded by a upstand (10); (b) the wider end of the bell socket (3) has an external rim (7) bearing on the annular seal (6); (c) the external rim (7) of the bell socket is pressed against the annular seal (6) by at least one pin (8) inserted through the upstand (10) surrounding the orifice (4).

Sealed connection system for connecting a pipe (1) carrying a hot fluid to a 
plastic member (2), in which the connection is achieved via an external bell (3) fixed to 

the pipe, serving as a heat shield and inserted into an orifice (4) made in the wall of the 
member (2), said orifice (4) comprising an internal projection (5) lined with an annular 

seal (6) and the widest part of the bell (3) being provided with an external flange (7) 
bearing on the annular seal (6); characterized in that the orifice (4) is surrounded, on 

the outside, at least partially, by a lip (10), and the external flange (7) of the bell is 
applied against the annular seal (6) by at least one pin (8) inserted into the lip (10) 

surrounding the orifice (4). 
Connection system according to Claim 1, in which the bell (3) is fixed at that 
end of the pipe inserted into the orifice in such a way that its widest part is facing 

towards the opposite side from this end of the pipe. 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
pipe (1) and the bell (3) are, in whole or in part, formed by at least one metal. 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
common end of the pipe and of the bell extends substantially beyond the level of the 

wall of the member (2), inside the latter. 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which at 
least one of the pins (8) is in the shape of a U. 
Connection system according to Claim 5, in which the central portion of at 
least one pin is deformed so as to give it approximately the shape of an arc of a circle. 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
pin has a substantially rectangular cross-section. 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
lip (10) comprises, at least over a portion of its periphery, an external flange (11) 

contained in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the orifice (4). 
Connection system according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
lip (10) forms part of an insert produced separately, using a substance different from 

that from which the major part of the member (2) is formed.  
 
Use of a connection system according to one ofthe preceding claims in 
order to connect, in an internal combustion engine, an exhaust gas recirculation pipe 

to a plastic inlet manifold.
