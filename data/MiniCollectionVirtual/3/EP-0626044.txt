<ABSTRACT>
A resilient device for the lost motion coupling and centring of first (10) and second (12) coaxial rotary members by enabling limited relative angular movement thereof. The second rotary member (12) has a portion surrounding a portion of the first rotary member (10). At least one spring (14) is substantially coaxially arranged between said portions of the first (10) and second (12) rotary members. A first linking means is provided for co-operatively linking the spring (14) and the first member (10), and a second linking means is provided for co-operatively linking the spring (14) and the second member (12). Said first and second linking means hold the first member (10) in a centred position relative to the second member (12) by means of the spring (14). At least one of the first and second linking means allows limited relative angular movement of the spring (14). Said spring (14) comprises a substantially ring-shaped continuous portion completely surrounding the first member (10).

Elastic device for centring and coupling, with 
backlash, a first (10) and second (12) coaxial rotary 

member permitting a limited relative angular displacement 
of these members, the second rotary member (12) having a 

portion surrounding a portion of the first rotary member 
(10), at least one spring (14) arranged substantially 

coaxially between the portions of the first (10) and 
second (12) rotary members, first linking means being 

provided to make the spring (14) and the first member 
(10) interact, second linking means being provided to 

make the spring (14) and the second member (12) interact, 
the first and second linking means ensuring the first 

member (10) is held in the centred rest position relative 
to the second member (12) by means of the spring (14), at 

least one of the first and second linking means allowing 
the limited relative angular displacement of the spring 

(14), the spring (14) comprising a substantially annular 
continuous portion completely surrounding the first 

member (10), one of the means for linking between the 
spring (14) and one of the members (1
0, 12) comprising at 
least one part projecting radially from the spring or 

from the member and interacting with at least one radial 
opening formed in the member or in the spring, the other 

means for linking between the spring and the other member 
comprising at least one rotary element with spherical or 

cylindrical symmetry, characterized in that the rotary 
element is arranged between two recesses, each one 

having, in transverse section, a concave V-shaped profile, 
and which are formed, for one of them, on the 

spring (14) and, for the other, on the other member, the  
 

V-shaped profiles being aligned in a radial direction in 
the centred rest position and their concavities pointing 

towards one another. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bottom of the V-shaped profiles is rounded and 

has a radius of curvature less than or equal to the 
radius of the rotary element. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the walls of the V-shaped profiles formed on the 

spring and on the other member are substantially parallel 
in pairs when the first and second rotary members are in 

the centred rest position. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the first linking means comprises at least one 

rotary element with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, 
arranged between a V-shaped recess formed on the external 

periphery of the first rotary member and a V-shaped 
recess formed on the internal periphery of the spring, 

and in that the second linking means comprises at least 
one part projecting radially towards the outside of the 

spring and interacting with at least one radial opening 
formed in the portion of the second member surrounding 

the first member. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first linking means comprises at least one 

rotary element with spherical or cylindrical symmetry 
arranged between a V-shaped recess formed on the external 

periphery of the first rotary member and a V-shaped 
recess formed on the internal periphery of the spring, 

and in that the second linking means comprises at least 
one portion projecting radially towards the inside of the 

second member and interacting with at least one radial 
opening formed in the spring. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the first linking means comprises at least one 

portion projecting radially towards the outside of the 
first member and interacting with at least one radial 

opening in the spring, and in that the second linking 
means comprises at least one rotary element with  

 
spherical or cylindrical symmetry arranged between a 

V-shaped recess formed on the internal periphery of the 
second rotary member and a V-shaped recess formed on the 

external periphery of the spring. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the first linking means comprises at least one 

portion projecting radially towards the inside of the 
spring and interacting with at least one radial opening 

in the first rotary member, and in that the second 
linking means comprises at least one rotary element with 

spherical or cylindrical symmetry arranged between a 
V-shaped recess formed on the internal periphery of the 

second rotary member and a V-shaped recess formed on the 
external periphery of the spring. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first linking means comprises at least one 

rotary element with spherical or cylindrical symmetry
