<ABSTRACT>
The switch cabinet (50) has a housing which is provided with a door (7) and in which a circuit breaker (1), which is in the form of a box, is enclosed. The circuit breaker (1) can be moved by means of a pushing movement within the switch cabinet (50) into a connected position or into a disconnected position, and has a stationary part (2), which is mounted in the switch cabinet housing, as well as a moving housing body (3) which interacts with the stationary part (2) and can be removed from the housing. The circuit breaker (1) furthermore contains a disconnected device for reaching the disconnected position or the connected position, and a switching lever (4) which is passed to the exterior through a first opening (6) which is provided in the door (7). A second opening (11) is provided in the door (7) of the switch cabinet housing. This second opening (11) is used for a tool (8) to pass through which makes it possible to operate the disconnecting device when the door (7) is closed. This switch cabinet complies with particularly stringent safety requirements.

Switch cabinet having a housing exhibiting a 
door (7) and having a box-shaped switch (1) which can 

be brought in the switch cabinet (50) by means of a 
pushing operation into a connected position or into a 

disconnected position, the switch (1) containing a 
fixed part (2) mounted in the housing, a movable 

housing body (3) which interacts with the fixed part 
(2) and can be removed from the housing, a 

disconnecting device for achieving the connected 
position or the disconnected position, and a switching 

lever (4) guided to the outside through a first opening 
(6) provided in the door (7), and the door (7) having a 

second opening (11) which serves to guide through a 
tool (8) which facilitates the operation of the disconnecting 

device with the door (7) closed, characterized 
in that the switch (1) exhibits an additional 

unit (5), which is guided through the first opening (6) 
and has a blocking lug (10) which closes the second 

opening (11) upon actuation of the switching lever (4) 
during a closing operation. 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the fixed part (2) exhibits a housing 

body constructed in the shape of an L, a side part 
(18), which is constructed as a limb of the L, serves 

to guide the housing body (3) of the switch (1) and to 
accommodate a part of the disconnecting device, and 

there is provided in the side part (18) at least one 
guide groove (30, 31), constructed in an undercut 

manner, for accommodating a profile (32, 33), which can 
be displaced in the guide groove (30, 31), of a 

retaining shoe (101) of the switch (1) (Figure 8). 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the disconnecting device exhibits a 

spindle drive which is mounted in the side part (18) 
and has an actuating shaft (9) and a driver carriage 

(19) which is moved in a sliding fashion by the  
 

actuating shaft (9) and acts on the housing body (3) of 
the switch (1). 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the disconnecting device exhibits 

a coupling device which is arranged on the housing body 
(3) and interacts in the closed state with a lever 

mechanism (21), arranged on the fixed part (2), of the 
disconnecting device. 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the coupling device exhibits at least 

one hook (34, 35), which is pivotably mounted on the 
housing body (3) and in the disconnected position and 

in the connected position grips a bolt (36) of the 
lever mechanism (21) from behind, and the lever 

mechanism (21) exhibits a lever arm (25) which is 
pivotably mounted on the fixed part (2) and strikes 

against the driver carriage (19) when the driver 
carriage (19) is displaced into the connected position. 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the driver carriage (19) exhibits a 

link (190) which in the disconnected position withholds 
a locking element (20) from a guide groove (31) which 

serves for the displacement of the housing body (3) 
(Figure 7). 
Switch cabinet according to one of Claims 2 to 
6, characterized in that there is arranged in the side 

part (18) a control link (23) which upon insertion of 
the housing body (3) into the switch cabinet (50) 

interacts with a hook (22) which can vary the pivoting 
angle of the coupling device (Figure 5). 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the control link (25) is mounted 

displaceably. 
Switch cabinet according to one of Claims 2 to 
8, characterized in that there is mounted on the side 

part (18) a blocking device (13) having at least one 
latch (119, 120) which in the inactive state of the 

blocking device (13) facilitates unhindered  
 

displacement of the housing body (3) with respect to 
the fixed part (2), and which in the active state of 

the blocking device (13) prevents displacement of the 
housing body (3) with respect to the fixed part (2) of 

the housing body (3) (Figures 15-17). 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the at least one latch (119, 120) is 

supported on a surface (46, 47), or a window-like 
opening (41) of a plate (44), which is arranged 

obliquely relative to the direction of displacement of 
the housing body (3) and can be moved standing upright 

in the direction of displacement under the action of a 
compression spring (45). 
Switch cabinet according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the plate (44) can be moved by means of 

a push button (51) which can be displaced in a sliding 
fashion in a parallel guide (52, 53), and there is 

provided in the parallel guide (52, 53) an opening 
(127) which is exposed when the push button is moved in 

and in which it is then possible to hang padlocks (58, 
59, 60) provided for safety purposes.
