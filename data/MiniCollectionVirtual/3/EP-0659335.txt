<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for applying a 
liquid substance to cheeses, provided with a conveyor for 

the cheeses, a supply apparatus for the liquid substance 
to the cheeses, provided with a V-shaped reservoir having 

one or more discharge openings with a distribution plate, 
attached on the bottom side of the reservoir, and with at 

least one cylidrical brush, arranged parallel to the 
reservoir, having long brush hairs, which sweep along the 

distribution plate. 
According to the invention, at least one of the side walls 
of the V-shaped reservoir is perforated, the distribution 

plate is attached to the lowest part of the perforated 
side wall, such, that the brush hairs in their direction 

of rotation first sweep along the distribution plate and 
then along the perforated side wall, and the brush hairs 

consist of long narrow strips of a slack fabric having a 
porous structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an installation for applying a 
liquid substance to cheeses, as described in the preamble 
of claim 1. Such an installation is known from Dutch patent application 
No. 71.15512. In this known installation, a V-shaped 
reservoir for the liquid substance is provided at 
its lowest point in the "tip of the V" with one or more 
openings, while the wipe-off surface is attached adjacent 
to the tip of the V on a side wall of the reservoir, said 
wipe-off surface projecting downwards at an angle of about 
45Â° with the direction of conveyance. The brush is arranged 
with its longitudinal centre line parallel to the 
reservoir and approximately in the longitudinal centre 
plane of the reservoir below it and is driven such, that 
the brush hairs first wipe along the discharge opening for 
the liquid substance and subsequently downwardly along the 
wipe-off surface. A drawback of this known installation is that due to fact 
that the coating liquid is taken downwardly along by the 
brush hairs from the reservoir openings to the free edge 
of the wipe-off surface, difficulties will be met in 
achieving an even distribution of the liquid over the 
brush hairs in the short time available, resulting in the 
liquid dripping from the wipe-off surface onto the cheeses 
and especially onto the conveyor, due to which not only a 
loss of coating material occurs, but the conveyor and the 
cheeses moreover become soiled and will need to be cleaned 
or retreated.  
 It is an object of the invention to remove this drawback 
of the known installation. This object is realized by the measures of the characterizing 
part of claim 1. By applying these measures, it is achieved that the brush 
hairs wipe up and take up the liquid substance, which has 
flown out over the metering surface, in upward direction 
from the metering surface. In this way, the metering 
surface doses the liquid substance evenly over the brush 
hairs in circumferential direction of the cylindrical 
brush, as a consequence of which the loss of liquid 
substance and soiling of the cheeses and the conveyor is 
restricted to a minimum. A preferred embodiment of the installation according to 
the invention is described in claim 2. The wipe-off surface of the installation according to the 
invention ensures that a possible excess of liquid 
substance which is taken along by the brush hairs is wiped 
off on the wipe-off surface and is possibly taken along by 
subsequent brush hairs, such, that the distribution of the 
liquid substance over the

Installation for applying a liquid substance to 
cheeses (4), comprising a conveyor (2) for the cheeses, an apparatus (8) 

having one or more openings for the supply of the 
liquid substance to the cheeses, which supply apparatus (8) is
