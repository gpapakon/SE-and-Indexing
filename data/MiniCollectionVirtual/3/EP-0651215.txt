<ABSTRACT>
Cooling device for cooling slaughtered animals (8, 
9) which have been at least partially eviscerated, and the 

belly cavity of which forms an essentially closed space, 
comprising a cooling chamber (1) which is provided with 

conveyor means for conveying the animals through it, while 
cooling medium supply means are present for supplying a 

cooling medium to the animals, with one or more supply 
openings (4, 5), and it is possible to direct the cooling 

medium to be delivered thereby to the outside of the 
slaughtered animals (8, 9), essentially at the position of 

a part of the body with a relatively high heat content. The 
cooling medium supply means preferably also comprise one or 

more auxiliary supply openings (5, 7), by means of which at 
least some of the cooling medium to be delivered by them 

can be guided into the belly cavity (16) of the slaughtered 
animals (8, 9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in the first place to 
a cooling device for cooling slaughtered animals which have 
been at least partially eviscerated, and the belly cavity 
of which forms an essentially closed space, at least 
comprising a cooling chamber which is provided with 
conveyor means for conveying the slaughtered animals to be 
cooled through the cooling chamber, while cooling medium 
supply means are present for supplying a cooling medium to 
the slaughtered animals. Such a device is known, for example, from US-A-3,769,807. 
It is intended for cooling carcasses of animals 
which have just been slaughtered, following which the 
cooled product can be subjected to further processing, such 
as cutting, freezing and the like. The object of the above-mentioned 
device is to make cooling occur as rapidly as 
possible, in order to be able to limit the dimensions of 
the cooling device in a slaughter line. In this case carbon 
dioxide is sprayed as the cooling medium into the cooling 
chamber, in order to bring said chamber to a suitable 
temperature. However, the abovementioned device has a number of 
major disadvantages. The cooling which can be achieved with 
the abovementioned device is not ideal, since the cooling 
of the chamber through which the slaughtered animals move 
is insufficient to achieve a uniform and rapid cooling of 
the animals. This means that the slaughtered animals still 
have to remain in the cooling chamber for a relatively long 
time, with the result that the cooling device has to be of 
considerable dimensions. There is also the risk that if the 
temperature of the cooling medium lies below freezing 
point, parts of the slaughtered animals will already be 
frozen before others are at the desired temperature. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
cooling device which does not have the abovementioned 
disadvantages of the prior art, and to that end it is 
characterized in that the cooling medium supply means have 
one or more supply openings which are situated near the  
 
path to be taken by the slaughtered animals, and which are 
directed in such a way that the cooling medium to be 
delivered by them can be guided to the outside of the 
slaughtered animals, essentially at the position of a part 
of the body with a relatively high heat content. Setting up the supply openings of the cooling 
medium supply means near the path to be taken by the 
slaughtered animals means that the cooling medium can be 
directed to those parts of the body of the slaughtered 
animal

<CLAIMS>
Cooling device for cooling slaughtered animals 
which have been at least partially eviscerated, and the 

belly cavity of which forms an essentially closed space, at 
least comprising a cooling chamber which is provided with 

conveyor means for conveying the slaughtered animals to be 
cooled through the cooling chamber, cooling medium supply 

means being present for supplying a cooling medium to the 
slaughtered animals, characterized in that the cooling 

medium supply means have one or more supply openings (4, 5) 
which are situated near the path to be taken by the 

slaughtered animals (8, 9), and which are directed in such 
a way that the cooling medium to be delivered by them can 

be guided to the outside of the slaughtered animals (8, 9), 
essentially at the position of a part of the body with a 

relatively high heat content. 
Cooling device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the cooling medium supply means also comprise one 

or more auxiliary supply openings (5, 7), which are 
directed in such a way that at least some of the cooling 

medium to be delivered by them can be guided into the belly 
cavity (16) of the slaughtered animals (8, 9). 
Cooling device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the supply openings (4, 5, 6, 7) are slit-shaped 

and extend in the envisaged direction of movement of 
the slaughtered animals (8, 9). 
Cooling device according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the cooling medium 

supply means are designed in such a way that the cooling 
device, viewed in the envisaged direction of movement of 

the slaughtered animals (8, 9), is divided into two or more 
cooling regions and the type of cooling medium to be 

supplied can be set in each region. 
Method for cooling slaughtered animals which are at 
least partially eviscerated, and the belly cavity of which 

forms an essentially closed space, in which method the 
slaughtered animals are conveyed through a cooling chamber 

 
while a cooling medium is supplied thereto, characterized 

in that the cooling medium is guided to the outside of the 
slaughtered animals essentially at the position of a part 

of the body with a high heat content. 
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that 
cooling medium is also guided into the belly cavity of the 

slaughtered animals. 
Method according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the temperature of the cooling medium supplied 

increases in the direction of movement of the slaughtered 
animals. 
Method according to one or more of claims 5-7, 
characterized in that cooled air is used as the cooling 

medium.
