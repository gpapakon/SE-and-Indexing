<ABSTRACT>
Hose allowing visual early detection of a malfunction, the structure of which allows localised deformation in determined regions, by association with at least one radial expansion region (C), of at least one compensation region (A, B), the said localised deformation being produced as soon as the leakage pressure of the fluid reaches a threshold value which is only a fraction of the service pressure.

Flexible pipe allowing early visual detection of a 
malfunction, the wall (4) of which comprises, within 

the cylindrical body (1), from its innermost part to 
its outer part, a sealing skin (6), a main 

reinforcement (5), an interpolated layer separating the 
reinforcements (7), a lift bearing (8), a confinement 

stratum (10), a safety reinforcement (9) the structure 
of which permits a localised deformation in determined 

zones, at least one of said zones being a 
radial expansion zone (C), an interpolated lift 

cushion (11) and a peripheral covering (12), said 
flexible pipe being characterised: 


in that the safety reinforcement is coaxial with 
the main reinforcement (5) over its whole length 

and is held at a distance therefrom, within the 
cylindrical body (1), by a low-cohesion lift 

bearing (8), the tear-resistance of which is at 
most equal to 5 bars and the adherence to 

components in contact is at most equal to 5 daN/cm 

width, 
in that it has at least one compensation zone (A, 
B) in which the differential of the laying angle 

(α, β) of the safety reinforcement (9) relative to 
the angle of equilibrium is between -2 and +12 

degrees, 
in that at least one compensation zone is formed 
by a contractile zone (A) in which the 

differential of the laying angle (α) of the safety 
reinforcement (9) is between +3 and +12 degrees 

and by a zone of dimensional invariance (B) in 
which the differential of the laying angle (β) of 

the safety reinforcement (9) is between -2 and +2  
 

degrees, 
 
such that the localised deformation occurs as soon as 

the leakage pressure (Pf) of the fluid that has passed 
through the defective main reinforcement reaches a 

threshold value (Vs) that is a fraction of the normal 
operating pressure (Ps). 
Flexible pipe according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cables of the main reinforcement (5) are high-modulus 

cables, made of steel or aromatic polyamide, 
arranged at a laying angle that is close to 36 degrees 

relative to the diametral plane of said flexible pipe. 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the lift bearing (8) and the 

interpolated lift cushion (11) are constituted by a 
compact elastomeric compound of millimetric thickness. 
Flexible pipe according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the lift bearing (8) is constituted partly by a 

fabric which is locally devoid of adhesive treatment. 
Flexible pipe according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the lift bearing (8) is partly constituted by a 

thin polymeric film, by polyethylene, by polypropylene 
or by polyester. 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the lift bearing (8) and the 

interpolated lift cushion (11) are constituted by a 
cellular composition of centimetric thickness having a 

specific mass between 30 and 70 kg/m
3
. 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that, in connection zones (D), the 

assembly of plies of the safety reinforcement (9)  
 

includes a transverse strengthener (13) constituted by 
a winding of cables orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 

(XX') of the flexible pipe and embedded within the 
interpolated lift cushion (11). 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the threshold value (Vs) of the 

leakage pressure (Pf) is equal to one quarter of the 
operating pressure (Ps) and causes, in each radial 

expansion zone (C), a radial swelling up to a value of 
130% of its initial diameter (De) accompanied by a 

reduction in length of about 20% and, in each 
contractile zone (A), a reduction in diameter of about 

97% of its initial value (De), accompanied by an 
elongation of about 23%, compensating for the reduction 

in length of the radial expansion zone (C). 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that, in a transitory connection zone 

(3), a single radial hooping (16), constituted by a 
winding of textile or metal cables orthogonal to the 

longitudinal axis (XX') of the flexible pipe encloses 
the safety reinforcement (9) so as to ensure its 

intimate contact with the confinement stratum (10) and 
the main reinforcement (5). 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the hooping of the main 

reinforcement (5) and of the safety reinforcement (9) 
is carried out by an end hooping (19) and intermediate 

hooping (20). 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that a mechanical attachment layer 

(18) is inserted between two constituent elements of 
the safety reinforcement (9) from the inter-reinforcement 

contact line (15) up to the inner face of  
 

a mating flange (2') where it joins the upper face of 
the main reinforcement (5). 
Flexible pipe according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the mechanical attachment layer (18) is the 

extension of the main reinforcement (5). 
Flexible pipe according to one of Claims 11 or 12, 
characterised in that a collar (2) comprises the mating 

flange (2') so as to grip the free end of the main 
reinforcement (5) and an additional flange (17) which 

grips the free end of the safety reinforcement (9), the 
confinement stratum (10) extending to below the inner 

part of the mating flange (2') and in that a sealing 
band (F) is placed circumferentially over said collar 

(2).
