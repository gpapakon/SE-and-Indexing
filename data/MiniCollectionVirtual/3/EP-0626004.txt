<CLAIMS>
A process for stabilizing aqueous zeolite suspensions 
by addition of surfactants, 
characterized in that
 
solely fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol ethers corresponding 

to formula 
(I):
R¹O-(CH₂CH₂O)
n
H
 
in which R¹ is a strictly linear aliphatic alkyl radical 

containing 12 to 14 carbon atoms and n is a number of 4.2 
to 4.8,
 
are added to the suspensions. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol ethers are 
added to aqueous suspensions of zeolite A containing 

zeolites in quantities of 20 to 60% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol 
ethers are added to the suspensions in quantities of 0.1 

to 5% by weight, based on the suspension.
