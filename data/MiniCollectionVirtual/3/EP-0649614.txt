<ABSTRACT>
A lunchbox (10) including a lid (14) and base (12) pivotally engaged 
by snap together hinge assemblies (40) and including a pivotal 

latch assembly (64) and a separate lock assembly (98). The lock 
assembly includes a pair of locking collars (100) on the pivoting 

handle (16) on the base (12) which engage a pair of lugs (106) 
on the lid (12) with 

withdrawal of the lugs being prevented in the carrying 
position of the handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
Carrying boxes, and especially lunchboxes,
particularly when intended for use by small children, present
special design problems.The lunchbox must be relatively inexpensive, and at
the same time of sturdy construction. The lunchbox should
also be easily opened by a young child, while at the same time
secure against accidental opening, particularly when subjected
to relatively rough handling as might be expected as the
children interact in travelling to and from school, on field
trips, and the like.While a degree of safety might be said to reside in a
typical metal lunchbox incorporating duplicate spaced latches,
such dual latches do not individually prevent the release of
the other latch, but rather act independently of each other in
securing spaced portions of the lunchbox. Each latch of such
a dual latch arrangement must also be individually manipulated
to both secure the lunchbox lid and release the lid. While
the procedure involved is relatively simple and
straightforward, when dealing with very young children, for 
example children of kindergarten age, such procedures can be a source of
difficulty.It will also be recognized that most conventional lunchboxes, particularly those
of the type incorporating a handle, utilize a substantial number of individual
pieces, including separate shells, hinges, latches, handles, and the like.FR-A-2275170 discloses a moulded plastics carrying case comprising first and
second shells, each comprising a peripheral wall including a front wall portion
and a rear wall portion, the rear wall portions of the two shells being hinged
together for selective pivotal movement of the shells between a closed position
overlying each other and closing said box, and an open position in which the
shells are outwardly pivoted relative to each other. A carrying handle is
pivotally mounted on the front wall portion of the peripheral wall of the first
shell. The handle is pivotable between a carrying position extending generally
perpendicular to the peripheral wall of the first shell and a release position
parallel with that peripheral wall. The case includes lock means for locking the
shells in the closed position, the lock means comprising a first lock component
on the handle and a second lock component on the peripheral wall of the
second shell. These lock components are alignable and releasably engageable
upon movement of the shells to the closed position and with said handle in its
release position and the lock components lock against release upon movement
of the handle from its

<CLAIMS>
A carrying box (10) including first and second shells (12,14), each
shell (12,14) comprising a peripheral wall including a front wall portion (20,30) and a

rear wall portion (22,32), hinge means (40) joining said rear wall portion (22,32) for
selective pivotal movement of said shells (12,14) between a closed position

overlying each other and closing said box (10), and an open position with said shells (12,14)
outwardly pivoted relative to each other, a carrying handle (16), at least one

mount (90) on said peripheral wall of said first shell (12) remote from said rear wall
portion (22) thereof, means (92) engaging said handle (16) to said mount (90) for

movement of said handle (16) between a carrying positions extending generally
perpendicular to said peripheral wall of said first shell (12), and a release position

remote from said carrying position, and lock means (98) for locking said shells
(12,14) in said closed position said lock means (98) comprising a first lock

component (100) on said handle (16) and a second lock component (106) on
said peripheral wall of said second shell (14), said lock components (100,106) being alignable

and releasably engageable upon movement of said shells (12,14) to said closed position
and with said handle (16) in said release position remote from said carrying

position, said lock components (100,106) locking against release upon
movement of said handle (16) from said release position toward said carrying

position, characterised in that the box includes latch means (62,64) comprising
first and second se
lectively interlockable latch components (62,64), one on said
peripheral wall of each said shells (12,14), remote from said rear wall portions, said

latch components (100,106) aligning and engaging with each other in said closed position for retention of
said shells (12,14) against movement to said open position and in that said latch means 

(62,64) and said lock means (98) are both mounted on said front wall portions
(20,30) of said peripheral walls, said lock means (98) serving to lock said shells (12,14) in

said closed position independently of said latch means (62,64).
The carrying box of claim 1 wherein said means (92) engaging said
handle (16) to said mount (90) comprises pivot means (92) for pivotal movement of said

handle (16) between said carrying position and said release position.
The carrying box of claim 2 wherein said first lock component (100)
comprises a keeper (100) with an access opening (102) therein, said second

lock component (106) comprising a lug (106) receivable in said keeper (100)
through said access opening (102), said access opening (102) aligning with said lug (106)

solely in said release position of said handle (16) whereby withdrawal of said
lug (106) from said keeper (100) is precluded in other than said release position.
The carrying box of claim 3 wherein said pivot means comprises a
pivot pin (92) on said mount (90), and an aperture (86) defined in said handle

(16) and receiving said pin (92), said keeper comprising a collar (100) on said
handle (16) encircling and coaxial with said aperture (86) whereby said collar

(100) rotates, upon pivotal movement of said handle (16), about said pivot pin (92), said
access opening (102) being defined radially through said collar (100) at an area

on the periphery of said collar (100) for radial introduction of said lug (106) into said
collar (100).
The carrying box of claim 4 wherein said handle (16) is
substantially U-shaped and comprises a grip bar (82) with laterally extending

legs (84) at opposite ends thereof, said pivot means (86,92) being associated 
with one of said handle legs (84), with said pivot means aperture (86) being defined

in said one of said handle legs (84).
The carrying box of claim 5 including duplicate pivot means (86,92)

said first lock components (100).
The carrying box of claim 7 wherein said first latch component
comprises a latch (64), a pivot member (70) integrally mounting said latch on

said second shell wall (30), said latch including a catch (72) and a pressure area
