<ABSTRACT>
A variable area con-di nozzle (10) for use as an attitude control 
thruster on a VTOL 

aircraft is formed by a curved wall (35,36) forming a chamber (15) a 
convergent section a throat 

section (16) and a divergent section (17) and a pair of parallel side 
plates (13,14), one of the side 

plates being movable to alter the area of the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a variable area convergent-divergent nozzle and 
particularly to a variable area convergent-divergent nozzle acting as part of an attitude 
control system for a vertical take off or landing aircraft. Generally such attitude control systems are formed by a plurality of downwardly 
acting thrusters at the extremities of the aircraft - nose, tail and wingtips. In vertical take off and landing (VTOL) aircraft it is well known that some form 
of reaction attitude control system must be used in order to allow the aircraft to be 
manoeuvered and remain stable while hovering because the conventional flight control 
surfaces will not work in the hover because there is no movement of air over them. A known type of reaction attitude control thruster is shown in Figure 1. The 
thruster is supplied with high pressure air from the aircrafts gas turbine engine along 
a duct 1 as indicated by the arrow 2. The duct 1 ends at a convergent nozzle 3 which 
accelerates the air through the exit or throat of the nozzle 3. The air leaving the 
nozzle 3 as indicated by an arrow 8 produces an upward thrust on the nozzle 3 
parallel to the arrow 8 which depends on the exit velocity, the mass of air passing 
through the nozzle 3 and the pressure of the air leaving the throat 4. In order to allow 
this generated thrust to be controlled to allow the aircraft to be manoeuvered a gate 
5 is used which pivots about a pivot point 6 under the control of a servo mechanism 
(not shown) to open or close the throat 4 by sliding an end plate 7 of the flap 5 across  
 
the throat 4 of the convergent nozzle 3. Convergent nozzles are relatively inefficient, 
so in order to allow a large enough couple to be generated on the aircraft for the 
attitude control to be effective the end plate 7 of the flap 5 has a curved portion 7a 
shaped so that when the flap 5 is moved so that the curved portion 7a covers the 
throat 4 of the convergent nozzle 3 the air leaving the nozzle 3 is diverted in the 
opposite direction to its normal flow, i.e. upwards in Figure 1 to generate a downward 
thrust. By arranging a pair of attitude control thrusters on opposite sides of the 
aircraft's centre of gravity so that one thrusts upwards and the other downward 
simultaneously an increased couple on the aircraft is generated. However this creates 
a problem because the upwardly directed air generates a downward thrust on the 
aircraft causing it to loose altitude which is undesirable. The main problems with 
thrusters of this type are, firstly

<CLAIMS>
A variable area convergent - divergent nozzle comprising a pair of fixed 
opposed walls defining a convergent and a divergent region and a pair of 

parallel sideplates extending between the walls to form a convergent - 
divergent 

nozzle, the sideplates being arranged for relative motion to allow the area of 
the nozzle to be changed. 
A nozzle as claimed in Claim 1 in which a first one of the sideplates is fixed 
relative to the walls and a second one of the sideplates is movable relative to 

the walls. 
A nozzle as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which the sideplates are flat. 
A nozzle as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3 in which gas enters the nozzle 
through the plane of the fixed sideplate. 
A nozzle as claimed in Claim 4 in which the gas turns through substantially 90Â° 
before leaving the nozzle. 
A nozzle as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5 in which the movable sideplate can 
be moved into contact with the fixed sideplate to shut off gas flow through the 

nozzle.
