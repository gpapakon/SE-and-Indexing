<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for building a tire including 
storing strip material (44) in a spool storage arrangement (12) 

without crushing underlying layers of the strip material by 
threading a relatively stiff liner (40) into a spiral groove (36) 

which is on the opposing axially inner surfaces of the 
spool (12). The spool rotates, drawing the liner and strip 

material into it and storing it in a series of coaxial 
spiral hoops. Radially outward layers of liner and strip 

material do not contact radially inward layers of liner and 
strip material, thus protect
ing the profile of the strip 
material from crushing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
building a tire including storing strip materials such as 
tire tread or sidewalls after extrusion and before 
application to an unvulcanized tire without deforming the 
strip material while it is in storage. Heretofore, strip material for building a tire has 
been carried on a liner and stored on a spool with the 
individual layers of liner separating the individual layers 
of strip material. At the top of the spool the weight of 
the outer layers of strip material was carried by the inner 
layers of strip material and has deformed the inner layers. 
This has been especially undesirable when the strip 
material had a predetermined cross-sectional profile shape, 
as in the case of a tread or sidewall of a tire. The present invention provides for building a tire 
with a spool having a pocket and having a hub and flanges 
with a spiral groove on the inner faces of the flanges. 
The liner is fed into a spiral groove in the flanges of the 
spool and forms a pocket which supports and protects the 
strip material. The edges of the liner maintain the 
convolutions in spaced relation so that the strip material 
is not compressed or deformed. The liner is made of a 
material which is stiff enough to support the strip 
material when it is suspended between the interfaces of the 
flanges and has sufficient resiliency to bend and spring  
 
into the spiral groove during winding of the liner on the 
spool. This resilience of the liner permits removal of the 
liner from the spiral groove as it is unwound from the 
spool. By supporting the liner in a coiled configuration 
in the flanges of the spool, the liner is held in the shape 
of a hoop which provides increased strength to support the 
strip material. Guides may be provided to engage the edges 
of the liner before it enters the spool for deflecting the 
edges of the liner in a direction normal to the line of 
travel of the liner and decreasing the width of the liner 
so that it may pass between the flanges of the spool. According to an aspect of the invention there is 
provided an improved process for building a pneumatic tire 
having a casing and a tread comprising the steps of: 
(a) extruding a strip of tread;  (b) winding the strip of tread in a spiral about an 
axis, the length of the strip being greater than that 
required for application to a plurality of casings sized 
for the extruded tread profile; (c) unwinding the strip of tread and cutting the 
strip to a length; (d) applying the cut length of

An improved process for building a pneumatic tire having 
a casing and a tread, the process comprising the steps of: 


(a) extruding a strip of tread; 
(b) winding the strip of tread in a spiral about an axis, the 
length of the strip being greater than that required for 

application to a plurality of casings sized for the extruded tread 
profile; 
(c) unwinding the strip of tread and cutting the strip to a 
length; 
(d) applying the cut length of tread to the tire casing; 
 
   the improved process being characterized by step (b) 

above comprising the step of: 
   preventing deformation of the tread while being spirally wound 

by preventing the weight of a portion of one winding of the tread 
from being transferred to another winding of the tread located 

beneath the one winding. 
The improved process for building a pneumatic tire of 
claim 1 further characterized by step (b) including the steps of: 


(a) winding the strip of tread with the axis of the spiral 
being substantially horizontal; and, 
(b) maintaining said axis of the spiral substantially 
horizontal, preventing the weight of the wound tread layers in the 

spiral from being transferred to vertically underlying layers of 
the tread. 
The improved process for building a pneumatic tire of 
claim 2 further characterized by step (b) including the steps of: 


(a) spirally winding a liner material in wound liner material 
layers having rigidity sufficient to support at least one wound 

tread layer between the layers of the spirally wound strip of 
tread; and

 
tread; and 
(b) providing a spacing between said wound liner material 
layers that is greater than the maximum radial cross sectional 

dimension of the tread strip. 
A method of storing strip material in a spool without 
compressing portions of said strip material underlying other 

portions of said strip material, said method comprising the steps 
of: 


(a) attaching a first end of a liner to a spool, the method 
being characterized by said spool having spaced-apart flanges 

providing a spiral groove in the axially inward, opposing surfaces 
of said flanges for receiving edges of said liner;

is rotated.

core having axially outer ends and an axis; first and second 
flanges having axial centerlines which are coaxial with said axis 

of said core, each of said flanges having an axially inner surface 
and an axially outer surface, each said axially inner surface 

being fixedly attached to one of said axially outer ends of said
