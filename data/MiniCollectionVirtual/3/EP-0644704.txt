<ABSTRACT>
A point-to-multipoint communication system is presented to
enable a reliable, high quality communication using multiplexed

optical signals between a central office equipment (100) and a
plurality of subscriber's equipment (300,400,600). The system is provided

with a plurality of office transceivers (110,120) in the central office equipment

(100), and the each of the subscribers is provided with at least one subscriber
transceiver (310,320; 410,420; 620). The system is designed so

that a redundancy system is built-in by providing one of either
the office transceivers, a plurality of subscriber's

transceivers or the optical connection device, to connect the
two sets of transceivers at all times. One of these redundancy

systems provides an operating connection between each of the
office transmitters which are connected to the office

transceivers and each of the subscriber transmitters which are
connected to the subscriber transceivers. Therefore, when a

malfunction occurs somewhere in the optical network, the least
number of the malfunctioning components need to be switched over

the the normally functioning system to maintain continued
communication services. The present communication system is

designed with the least number of active components, therefore,
the failure probability is significantly decreased, and repairs

if necessary can be preformed quickly. The overall effect of
the present system is that interactive point-to-multipoint

communication services of high quality and reliability are
provided at reasonable cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a point-to-multipoint 
optical communication system to enable one transmission 
equipment at the central office to interactively communicate 
with a plurality of transceiver equipment at the subscriber 
premises. There have been many R & D activities to develop point-to-multipoint 
optical communication systems in which one 
communication equipment at the central office can interactively 
communicate with a plurality of subscriber's equipment which are 
connected through branched optical paths to the central office 
equipment. A known example of such a system is a passive double 
star (PDS) system. In the PDS system, branching of optical path lines is 
carried out by using an optical star coupler. The optical star 
coupler is a passive device which optically connects one optical 
fiber at the central office with any number (an integer) of 
subscriber's optical fibers, and performs the functions of 
optically merging subscriber's optical signal (referred to as 
upstreaming signals, or U-signals hereinbelow) and outputting 
the merged optical signal towards the central office. The 
optical star coupler also performs the functions of separating 
the optical signals from the central office equipment into the  
 
plurality of subscriber's optical fibers, and broadcasting the 
separated signals (referred to as downstreaming signals, or D-signals) 
to individual subscriber's equipment. The PDS subscriber system will be explained with reference 
to Figures 21 and 22. Figure 21 is a schematic illustration of the basic 
configuration of the PDS subscriber system using a set of 
unidirectional star couplers. To simplify the presentation, 
there are shown only two subscriber's equipment, however, it is 
quite possible to increase this number to any number of 
subscriber's equipment. In this system, the set of star couplers 210a, 210b is 
disposed at a branching point in the optical path line to 
optically connect the central office equipment 100 with two 
subscriber's equipment 300, 400. Here, the star coupler 210a is 
an optical merger for merging the upstreaming signals, and 
optically connects the optical signal receiver 112 of the 
optical signal transceiver 110 at the central office with the 
optical signal transmitter 311 of the transceiver section 310 of 
the subscriber's equipment 300 and with the optical signal 
transmitter 411 of the transceiver section 410 of the 
subscriber's equipment 400. The optical star coupler 210b is an 
optical signal splitter for branching the
