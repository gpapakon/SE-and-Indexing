<ABSTRACT>
A tape holding case (10) is described for use with a thermal 
printing device (4) which allows for more efficient cutting and 

feeding of tape (14). The cassette (10) has a slot into which a cutting 
blade (30) can pass which avoids the use of an anvil for cutting. 

Moreover, the cassette (10) can have a stepped portion for 
providing a so-called "peel cut" at the end of the tape (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette for a thermal 
printer, and to a thermal printer in combination with such a 
cassette. Thermal printers of the type with which the present invention 
is concerned are known. They operate with a supply of tape 
arranged to receive an image and a means for transferring 
image onto the tape. In one form, a tape holding case or 
cassette holds a supply of image receiving tape and a supply 
of an image transfer ribbon, the image receiving tape and 
transfer ribbon being passed in overlap through a printing 
zone of the printing device. A printing device operating with 
a tape holding case of this type is described for example in 
EP-A-0267890 (Varitronics, Inc.). Other printing devices have 
been made in which letters are transferred to an image 
receiving tape by a dry lettering or dry film impression 
process. In all of these printing devices, the construction 
of the image receiving tape is substantially the same. That 
is, it comprises an upper layer for receiving an image which 
is secured to a releasable backing layer by a layer of 
adhesive. Once an image or message has been printed on the 
tape, it is desired to cut off that portion of the tape to 
enable it to be used as a label. For this purpose, it is 
necessary to remove the releasable backing layer from the 
upper layer to enable the upper layer to be secured to a 
surface by means of the adhesive layer. In EP-A-0267890 
scissors are used to cut off the tape. EP-A-0,327.075 discloses a tape cut-off assembly which includes 
a secured blade and a movable blade mounted for shearing movement 
with respect to the secured blade.  
 In another type of printing device described for example in 
EP-A-0322919 (Brother) a tape holding case holds a supply of 
image receiving tape, a supply of an image transfer ribbon and 
a supply of adhesive backing tape. The adhesive backing tape 
has an adhesive layer for contact with the image receiving 
tape, a substrate layer and a second adhesive layer covered by 
a releasable backing layer. The characters are printed onto  
 
the image receiving tape, which is transparent, as a mirror 
image. In a further printing device, described for example in 
EP-A-0487313 (Esselte Dymo N.V.), a tape holding case holds a 
supply of image receiving tape and a supply of image transfer 
ribbon, the image receiving tape having the same construction 
as described above with reference to EP-A-0267890. In this 
device, the cassette includes a feed roller which is rotatably 
mounted and which
