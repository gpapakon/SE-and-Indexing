<ABSTRACT>
A water-permeable concrete formwork of thermo-plastic resin characterized in that a thermoplastic resin layer 
having water permeability is provided on at least one of the surfaces of a basic thermoplastic resin layer, whereby 

removal of moisture from placed concrete is promoted by absorption and/or permeation of moisture of said concrete 
by and/or through said water-permeable thermoplastic resin layer, thereby making it possible to significantly reduce 

the curing time of concrete.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water permeable 
concrete shuttering made of a thermoplastic resin having 
a water permeable surface layer. As a concrete shuttering, shutterings made of 
wood such as South Sea wood or the like have heretofore 
been used in large amounts. However, in view of the 
recent earth environmental problems, development of concrete 
shutterings made of other materials than wood 
material has been required, and concrete shutterings 
made of thermoplastic resins have been proposed as 
typical ones. This concrete shuttering made of a thermoplastic 
resin is usually such that the panel surface of the 
shuttering is composed of a thermoplastic resin sheet or 
a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin sheet whose 
strength has been enhanced with a fiber such as glass 
fiber or the like, and said sheet is prepared by melting 
a thermoplastic resin or a mixture thereof with glass 
fiber or the like and forming it into a sheet, and the 
surface of the sheet has the structure that it is completely 
covered with a resin. Such a concrete shuttering having a panel surface  
 
made of a thermoplastic resin has such many advantages 
that it does not cause any earth environmental 
problem resulting from the use of a large amount of 
wood, is lighter in weight than a concrete shuttering 
made of wood and is also excellent in releasability from 
concrete after the concrete has been poured using the 
shuttering. On the other hand, however, the panel surface 
contacting concrete does not absorb water content nor is 
permeated by water content, so that there has been such 
a disadvantage that the so-called curing time from the 
pouring of concrete to the complete hardening of 
concrete becomes long. Under such circumstances, the present 
inventors have made research for the purpose of 
developing a concrete shuttering made of a thermoplastic 
resin which satisfies the characteristics required as 
concrete shuttering and can shorten the concrete-curing 
time, and have consequently reached this invention. That is, this invention provides a water-permeable 
concrete shuttering made of a thermoplastic 
resin composed of a thermoplastic resin layer and a 
thermoplastic resin layer having water-permeability 
provided on at least one of the surfaces thereof.  Fig. 1 shows a sectional structure of the 
water-permeable concrete shuttering of this invention in 
which the base thermoplastic resin layer is a flat plate 
having a water-permeable thermoplastic resin layer on 
both surfaces thereof. Fig. 2 shows a
