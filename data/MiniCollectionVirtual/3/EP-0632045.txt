<ABSTRACT>
A method which can reduce fifty-fold the size of 
equipment required for making a given volume of alkyltin 

thioglycolic acid esters. An alkyltin thiocarboxylic acid 
ester is made from the corresponding alkyltin halide and 

thiocarboxylic ester in a continuous process that requires 
but one agitated reaction vessel. The organic reactants 

and an acid acceptor are added simultaneously to a vessel 
equipped with agitator impellers and containing a 

sufficient level of water to provide an agitatable medium. 
Extremely vigorous agitation (at least 75 turnovers per 

minute, which is sufficient to achieve a fluid velocity 
across the impeller(s) of at least 15.2m per minute) is 

employed to avoid side reactions which often cause the 
formation of a tenacious, stringy emulsion, the breaking of 

which requires a rather difficult and wasteful filtration. 
Continuous withdrawal of the reaction mixture from said 

reactor is commenced promptly after commencement of the 
additions and said mixture is continuously separated into 

the aqueous phase and an organic phase as it is withdrawn 
without the need of demulsification means. The pH of the 

reaction mixture is greater than 7 but the maximum is 8.2 
and the preferred temperature is from 40 to 80°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to PVC stabilizers. In particular, it
relates to a method for making an alkyltin thiocarboxylic acid
ester from the corresponding alkyltin halide and thiocarboxylic
ester. More particularly, it relates to a method for continuously
synthesizing such an ester in an aqueous medium in a single vessel
with extremely vigorous agitation.Because of the drawbacks associated with the use of an organic
solvent in batchwise preparations of such esters in the past (e.g.,
diminished yields based on the space and time allotted to the
process), some have turned to methods in which the product is still
made batchwise but with the elimination of the organic solvent.
These, too, have their shortcomings. If the reaction mixture is
strongly alkaline at the beginning of a batch, the pH decreases
only gradually as the alkyltin halide is introduced; such
conditions favor the hydrolysis of the starting materials. To
minimize such hydrolysis, low temperatures are necessary during the
rather long holding times associated with batchwise procedures.
Side reactions such as the formation of alkyltin oxide by the
reaction of ammonium hydroxide (an acid acceptor) and the alkyltin
halide, and the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the thiocarboxylic
ester cause loss of desired product and produce materials which
often cause the formation of a tenacious, stringy emulsion, the
breaking of which requires a rather difficult and wasteful
filtration.Maul et al
(EP-A-81458 and U. S. Patent
4,554,368) propose to provide a
continuous process for the Preparation of these esters which
comprises carrying out the reaction continuously in a system
consisting of 1 to 5 agitated vessels with an average dwell time of 
1 to 60 minutes at a constant pH value in the range from 3
to 8 and at a temperature from 40 to 80°C. Maul teaches
that it is convenient to initiate the reaction batchwise,
pumping the alkyltin chloride and the thiocarboxylic acid
ester in the required molar ratio into the first reactor to
fill it halfway before an aqueous solution of the base is
added with stirring to raise the pH to the desired value.
Then, the continuous addition of base, ester, and chloride
is started and the volume of the reaction mixture is
controlled by pumping it into a second agitator vessel. It
is not clear that the continuous process described by Maul
in terms of two agitator vessels would be successful when
only one agitator vessel is used.GB-A 1374024 discloses a process for preparing a di-organotin-bis(thioglycollate
ester) from a
