<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for at least partial desalination (demineralisation) of water, treating the water with a weakly acidic cation exchanger in the hydrogen form. In order to demineralise water as substantially as possible with the smallest possible amount of ion exchanger, and, in particular, not only to soften the water but also to remove nitrate from it, according to the invention it is proposed that the water, before or simultaneously with the treatment with the weakly acidic cation exchanger, is treated with a strongly basic anion exchanger in the hydroxyl or hydrogen carbonate form.
