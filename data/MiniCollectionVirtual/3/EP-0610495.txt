<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an arrangement including a microprocessor controller, PROM memory, and a digital to analog converter (DAC) arrangement for generating a plurality of control voltages for trimming respective ones of a plurality of varactor controlled tunable filters. The controller couples digital control signals to the respective DACs which generate respective analog control voltages which are applied to the respective tunable filters. A tuning voltage generated by a closed control loop, such as phased locked loop also under the control of the controller, is combined with the output control voltages generated by the respective DAC's in a resistance divider arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the frequency
alignment of a plurality of tunable filters of a tuner which have a
tuning frequency responses which are determined by the
magnitudes of respective control signals.US patent 4, 334,323 describes a tuning system, comprising a plurality
of tunable circuits for coupling an RF signal source to a frequency
conversion means, each of the tunable circuits including a reactive
element having a reactive value determined by the magnitude of a
respective analog control signal; a phase lock loop coupled to supply a
tuning signal to a local oscillator for providing a frequency conversion
signal to the frequency conversion means; control means responsive to a
channel selection signal source for providing a plurality of digital channel
selection signals; and circuit means for applying the plurality of digital
channel selection signals to the tunable circuits for tuning channels
selected by the channel selection signal.Tunable filters responsive to the magnitude of a
control signal, e.g., a tuning voltage, are employed to select one RF
carrier from a plurality of received RF carriers, and for generating
a local oscillator (LO) signal having the appropriate frequency for
heterodyning the selected RF carrier to produce the IF signal.
When the passband of the RF filters do not properly track with
each other and the frequency of the local oscillator signal, the
desired resultant IF signal may be degraded and the possibility of
crosstalk from adjacent TV channels is increased.Tunable filters usually include a voltage controlled
capacitance (varactor) diode as a frequency control element
because a varactor diode exhibits a capacitance vs. voltage
characteristic when they are reverse biased. Owing to the normal tolerances of components
employed in tuning systems and to normal production variations,
it is necessary that the tunable filters in the RF tuner be initially
adjusted in production. This is because the varactor diodes in the
RF filters and local oscillator circuits do not have precisely the
same capacitance characteristics over the voltage range
corresponding to the tuning band of frequencies. This initial
adjustment typically involves mechanically "trimming" inductive
and capacitive elements so that the frequency responses of the
various tuned circuits are aligned and track one another
throughout one or more frequency bands. However, these
alignment adjustments are often time-consuming, sometimes
requiring an iterative alignment procedure. The present invention which is
