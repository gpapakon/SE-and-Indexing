<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
treatment of diseases and disorders. More specifically, 
the present invention relates to retarding the aging 
process. Since the beginning of civilization, man has 
searched for ways to slow down the aging process. 
Although a variety of techniques, nutrients, and 
medicaments have been explored, the search for a method 
and/or composition for reducing the aging process has 
been elusive. One of the difficulties in developing 
useful methods is that there is very little uniformity 
in the scientific community regarding the mechanism of 
the aging process. A popular theory on aging is the free radical 
theory. Pursuant to this theory, oxidative damage of 
cell organelles and components (DNA, RNA, protein, 
lipids, etc.) caused by lipid peroxidation, ionizing 
radiation, ultraviolet rays, and chemicals results in a 
loss of functionality, degregation, degeneration, and the 
death of cells. A number of investigators have looked at the free 
radical mechanism of aging. See, Harmon, Free Radical

Unsaturation of Dietary Fat on Mortality Rate, J.

Nutrition 2 (2) 84-89. The aging process in human beings and animals is a 
combination of extremely complex biochemical phenomena. 
There may be one or more mechanisms involved in the aging 
process (e.g., free radical reactions, Malliard 
reactions, damaged proteins synthesizing machinery, 
etc.). However, at this time, the state of the art does 
not appear able to stop these naturally occurring 
processes. Senescence is especially defined as "an increased 
vulnerability occurring with advancing

Use in a preparation for the purpose of retarding the aging process 
in a mammal of a composition that stimulates the intracellular synthesis of 

glutathione in an amount to maintain in the mammal at least 5 nmol/mg 
protein level of glutathione in circulating lymphocytes. 
Use according to Claim 1 wherein said amount is sufficient to 

maintain the protein level at at least 7 nmol/mg. 
Use according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the composition includes at 
least one component for stimulating the intracellular synthesis of 

glutathione chosen from: L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; esters of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; 
glutathione esters; and proteins or peptides 

rich in cysteine. 
Use according to Claim 3 including proteins rich in cysteine in 
addition to at least one of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; esters of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; 

and glutathione esters. 
Use according to Claim 3 or 4 wherein the proteins rich in cysteine 
have a cysteine content of at least 2% by weight of the protein. 
Use according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein the cysteine-rich protein 
includes whey protein, egg white, lactalbumin and/or serum albumin. 
Use according to any preceding claim wherein the composition is 
enterally administrable. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the composition 
is parenterally administrable.

person comprising: 

   15 to 30% of the calories from cysteine-rich protein; 
   15 to 25% of the calories from lipids; 

   45 to 70% of the calories from carbohydrates; and 
   vitamin/mineral mixture meeting or exceeding US RDA values in 

 
1,000 or 2,000 calories of product. 
The diet, regimen or composition of Claim 9, including beta-carotene 
≧ 3,000 IU/1,000 calories, Vitamin C ≧ 150 mg/1,000 

calories, Vitamin E ≧ 45 mg/1,000 calories, zinc ≧ 20 mg/1,000 
calories, and selenium ≧ 150 micrograms/1,000 calories.

least one component chosen from L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; esters 

of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate; and glutathione esters. 
The diet, regimen or composition of Claim 9, 10 or 11, wherein the 
cysteine-rich protein includes whey protein, egg white, lactalbumin and/or 

serum albumin. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein the 
composition is according to Claim 11.
