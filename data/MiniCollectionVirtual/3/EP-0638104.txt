from the reaction, in an aqueous medium, at room temperature, of undecylenic acid

with at least one hydrophilic organic macromolecule possessing primary alcohol
and/or primary amine groups a
nd having a molecular weight greater than 2000
Daltons, as an antimicrobial, antibacterial or antifungal agent.
Use of an undecylenic acid derivative in the form of the product resulting
from the reaction, in an aqueous medium, at room temperature, of undecylenic acid

with at least one hydrophilic organic macromolecule possessing primary alcohol
and/or primary amine groups and having a molecular weight greater than 2000

Daltons, as an active agent in the manufacture of a cosmetic or pharmaceutical
composition with antimicrobial, antibacterial or antifungal activity, particularly in a

proportion by weight of said active agent of between 0.1 and 5% by weight, based
on the total weight of the composition.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the undecylenic acid
derivative is a principal or auxiliary preservative in a cosmetic or pharmaceutical

composition, particularly in a proportion of between 0.1 and 5% by weight,
preferably of between about 1 and about 3% by weight.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the undecylenic acid
derivative is an antidandruff agent, particularly in a proportion of between 0.1 and

5% by weight.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the undecylenic acid
derivative is an antiacne agent, particularly in a proportion of between 0.1 and 5%

by weight.

derivative is a deodorant and antiperspirant, particularly in a proportion of between

0. 1 and 5% by weight.
Use according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
proportion of undecylenic acid relative to the above-mentioned hydrophilic organic

macromolecule is 10 to 75% by weight, preferably between 50 and 75% by weight.

reaction product has been neutralized with an organic or mineral base such as an

amine or zinc or aluminium hydroxide.
Use according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
undecylenic acid derivative is in the form of the reaction medium which has been

neutralized with an organic or mineral base and then subjected to a lyophilization
step.
Use according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
undecylenic acid derivative is obtained by reacting the undecylenic acid as a 

mixture with another saturated or unsaturated fatty acid having in particular from 8
to 28 carbon atoms.
