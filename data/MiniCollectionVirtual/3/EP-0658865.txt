<ABSTRACT>
An inexpensive smoke detector having excellent general 
versatility and reliability which allows an increase in a 

range of selecting light emitting devices used for such 
smoke detectors and which allows reductions in the number of 

processes and the adjustment equipment, thereby reducing the 
cost and avoiding human adjustment errors. The smoke 

detector includes an A/D conversion circuit for measuring an 
output from a photo transistor which receives a light output 

of at least a light emitting diode used for a smoke 
detection. A MPU generates a signal for driving the light 

emitting diode, based on a value measured by the A/D 
conversion circuit. The smoke detector also includes an 

EEPROM. A D/A conversion circuit adjusts a light emission 
quantity of the light emitting diode based on a value read 

from the EEPROM. The smoke detector further includes a 
voltage/current conversion circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a smoke detector arrangement comprising at least one 
photo-electric smoke detector comprising a smoke detection chamber including at least one 
light emitting device for detecting smoke, and light receiving means receiving a light output 
from said light emitting device influenced by smoke in the detection chamber, measurement 
means for measuring an output from said light receiving means , and signal generating means 
for generating a drive signal for driving said light emitting device, based on a value measured 
by said measuring means. Smoke detectors of the above type are disclosed in GB-A-2 188 725, EP-A-0 122 489 
or JP-A-59/210 347, e.g. With these smoke detectors, the following problems arise: Generally, in the manufacturing process of smoke 
detectors, the sensitivity of the smoke detector varies 
depending on variations in the individual parts of the smoke 
detector provided for use. It is thus necessary to adjust 
the smoke detector to reach correct sensitivity. The variations in the parts of a photoelectric-type 
smoke detector, which variations have an adverse influence 
on sensitivity, largely include a variation in light 
emission quantity due to a variation in luminous efficiency 
of a light emitting device, a variation in light receiving 
quantity due to a variation in the light receiving 
efficiency of a light receiving device, a variation in 
amplification degree of an amplifying circuit, and other 
variations.  
 Conventionally, the following sensitivity adjustment 
methods are available by way of example for correcting the 
level of sensitivity required because of the foregoing 
variations in parts. Test smoke is applied to the smoke 
detector, or alternatively, a test instrument exhibiting an 
effect similar to smoke is inserted into the detection 
section of the smoke detector, and the amplification degree 
or other factors of an amplifying circuit are adjusted using 
a variable resistor, or the like, so that a light receiving 
output obtained after being amplified when the test 
instrument is in the detection section becomes a correct 
value. Alternatively, adjustments are made, using a 
variable resistor, or the like, for a fire determining 
threshold of a fire determining circuit used for determining 
whether an output from the amplifying circuit has reached 
such a threshold. Conventional smoke detectors perform sensitivity 
adjustments as described above. However, there is a limit 
to the range of the sensitivity adjustments performed by a 
va
