<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spraying attachment (10) for a liquid container (11) which is designed to be essentially cylindrical at least in an opening region (28), having an outer part (12) which is of cap-shaped design and whose top wall (26) is provided on the inside with a projection (25) and can be fitted, with its opposite end provided with a container receiving opening (27), over the opening region (28) of the liquid container (11) and is displaceable relative thereto. An inner part (13) has a rising pipe (14) which is designed as a piston rod and is provided with a piston (15) at its end which can be introduced into the liquid container (11) and with a pressure relief valve (16) in its top plate (17) which can be connected to the outer part (12). A valve compartment (20) formed between the pressure relief valve (16) of the inner part (13) and the top wall (26) of the outer part (12) is connected in terms of flow via an eddy channel (22) to an outlet opening (23) arranged in the outer part (12). By displacing the outer part (12) axially into the liquid container (11), scent samples can be delivered sensitively. The spraying attachment (10) is reusable.

Spray cap (10) for a liquid container, particularly for dispensing perfume
samples, the opening region (28) of which is of at least substantially

cylindrical construction, including

an outer portion (12) in the nature of a closure cap, the top wall
(26) of which is provided on its inner surface with a projection (25) and

whose opposite end is provided with a container receiving opening (27)
for the opening region (28), the outer portion (12) and the liquid

container (11) being movable with respect to one another, and
an inner portion with a feed tube (14), which is constructed as a
piston rod, which is provided at its end which may be introduced into the

cylindrical opening region (28) of the liquid container (11) with the
piston (15),

characterised in that

the feed tube (14) is provided at the opposite end with a top plate (17),
associated with which is an overpressure valve (16), the top plate (17) of

the inner portion (13) being firmly held against the underside of the top
wall (26) of the outer portion (12), a valve space (20) defined between

the overpressure valve (16) of the inner portion (13) and the top wall (26)
of the outer portion (12) being in liquid communication with a discharge

opening (23) arranged in the outer portion (12) by means of a vortex
passage (22).
Spray cap as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the mounting of
the inner portion (13) in the outer portion (12) comprises a projection 

(25) on the inner surface of the top wall (26) of the outer portion (12) and
an axial opening (35) in the top plate (17) of the inner portion (13) into

which the projection (25) may be force-fitted.
Spray cap as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the overpressure
valve comprises a slit valve (16).
Spray cap as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the piston rod (14)
of the inner portion (13) is provided at its end, spaced above the piston

(15), with a support ring (32).
Spray cap as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the outer portion
(12) is provided with a sliding guide (29) at its end provided with the

container receiving opening (27).
Use of a spray cap as claimed in Claim 5 for closing a liquid container
(11) for perfume samples, the sliding guide (29) being provided with an

annular shoulder (30) to secure the outer portion (12) behind a sealing
edge (31) on the liquid container (11).
Spray cap as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the outer portion
(12) is provided with a device for fastening it to an article of clothing,

preferably a retaining clip (37).
