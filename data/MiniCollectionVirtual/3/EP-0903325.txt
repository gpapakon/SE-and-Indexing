<ABSTRACT>
An apparutus and a method for ozone treatment
of secondary sludge under contemplation of reducing biosludges

occurring during a biological treatment of aqueous
organic waste, wherein the apparatus comprises


a plurality of reactors for effecting the
ozone treatment of the biosludge by contacting the

biosludge with an ozone-containing gas,
biosludge passages (11,12,13) for flowing the biosludge to
be ozone-treated through all the reactors in series,
gas supply (16) means for supplying the ozone-containing
gas to each of the reactors,
a pressurization means (29) for maintaining each of
the reactors under a pressurized condition and
stirrers (21) each disposed in each reactor for
realizing a nearly equalized ozone absorption rate for

all the reactors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method for ozone-treating biosludges, such as
activated sludge, digested sludge and the like,
occurring in biological treatment of aqueous organic
wastes and to a method for such ozone treatment.In an aerobic or anaerobic biological treatment
of an aqueous organic waste, biosludges are formed,
such as activated sludge and digested sludge. While
excessive biosludges formed in the biological treatment
system should be removed therefrom, they exhibit a high
biological stability, which makes disposal of such
biosludges through biodegradation or biolysis difficult.
In addition, they are highly persistent to
dehumidification, which makes disposal of such biosludge
by having recourse to dewatering difficult. Under the
contemplation of solving the problem of disposal of
such biosludges occuring upon biological treatment of
aqueous organic wastes, a technique was proposed for a
biological treatment of such biosludges, which comprises
subjecting the biosludge to an ozone treatment and
recycling the so-ozonized biosludge to the original
biological treatment of the waste by an activated sludge 
in order to subject it to a biolysis (Japanese Patent
Kokai Hei-7-206088). In this technique by an ozone
treatment, the biosludges are converted into BOD
components susceptible to biological metabolization by
the living microorganisms in the activated sludge under
decomposition into gases and inorganic substances.The method for ozone-treating excess amount of
biosludge of this prior art uses an apparatus in which
an ozone-containing gas is blown into a layer of a
biosludge contained in an ozonizing reactor to cause a
gas/liquid contact to facilitate the ozonization of the
biosludge. The reactor used in the apparatus of the
prior art is designed to be filled with the biosludge
up to a liquid depth of about 1 meter or so and to blow
the ozone-containing gas thereinto under atmospheric
pressure, so that only a relatively low ozone
concentration in the liquor can be attained for
effecting the ozonization, resulting in a lower yield
of ozonization. Thus, it is necessary for increasing
the ozonization yield in this prior art to increase the
biosludge residence time in the reactor and any
efficient ozonization cannot be expected.For improving such circumstances, a technique
was proposed, in which the ozone treatment of biosludge
is effected with an ozone-containing gas under an
elevated pressure (Japanese Patent Kokai Hei 8-192196).
While this technique attains an increased ozone
absorption rate

<CLAIMS>
A method for ozone-treating biosludge, comprising
passing the biosludge through a plurality of reactors

(3a,3b,3c) in series, while supplying an ozone-containing
gas to each of the reactors with agitation of the

biosludge, under pressure, in such a manner that there are
nearly equal (within Â±20%) rates of ozone absorption in all

the reactors.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein three reactors
are employed.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the ozone-containing
gas is supplied to the three reactors by causing

the gas to flow through them in series.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the ozone-containing
gas is supplied to the three reactors in

parallel.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the biosludge passes from an upper part of a first reactor

(3a) to a lower part of a second reactor (3b) and from an
upper part of the second reactor to a lower part of a third

reactor (3c).
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
biosludge is agitated by a stirrer (21a,21b,21c) that

rotates about a vertical axis.
A method for the treatment of aqueous organic waste,
which comprises aerating the waste in the presence of

activated biosludge, settling the biosludge from the
aerated waste, and treating part of the biosludge by a

method according to any of claims 1 to 6.
