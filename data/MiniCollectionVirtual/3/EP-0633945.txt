<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to monoclonal antibodies to the av beta 3 integrin receptor known to be expressed in large amounts on the surface of osteoclasts and accordingly, associated with bone resorption. The disclosed monoclonal antibodies are believed to recognize unique epitopes on av beta 3 and are useful in the treatment of conditions associated with excessive bone resorption and/or in the inhibition of tumor cell growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to hybrid cell lines (lymphocyte hybridomas) for the production
of monoclonal antibodies to αvβ3 integrin, to such homogeneous antibodies, and to the use
of such antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.αvβ3 is a member of the integrin supergene family of cell-surface glycoprotein receptors
that promote cellular adhesion. Each cell has a specific repertoire of receptors that define its
adhesive capabilities. The integrins are expressed as heterodimers of noncovalently
associated α and β subunits. According to the nomenclature proposed by Hynes, R.O. [Cell
48, 875-886 (1987)], the integrins can be divided into families each with a common β-subunit
and a set of variable o-subunits known to associate with the common β-subunit. The
different α chains are denoted by the original cell type, by a subscript used by the original
discoverer, or, as in the case of the αvβ3 receptor, by the nature of the ligand (i.e. αv stands
for a vitronectin receptor α-chain). Many, but not all, integrin receptors have been shown to
interact with proteins via a tripeptide sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp (or RGD using the single letter
amino acid code), originally defined from studies of the cell binding domains of fibronectin
[Ruoslahti, E. and Pierschbachter, M.D., Cell44, 5170518 (1986); Ruoslahti, E. and
Pierschbachter, M.D., Science238, 491-497 (1987)].αvβ3 (also referred to as vitronectin receptor or VNR) is a member of the β3 integrin
subfamily and is expressed on a variety of cells, including endothelial, melanoma, smooth
muscle cells and, along with another integrin α2β1 (VLA-2) (the receptor for Type I collagen
and laminin), on the surface of osteoclasts [Horton, M.A. and Davies, J., J. Bone Min. Res.
4, 803-808(1989); Davies, J. et al., J. Cell. Biol.109, 1817-1826(1989); Horton, M., Int.
J. Exp. Pathol.71 741-759 (1990)]. αvβ3 mediates cell adhesion to vitronectin, fibrinogen,
fibronectin, thrombospondin, osteopontin, bone sialo protein II and von Willebrand factor.Osteoclasts are the main type of bone cells involved in the resorption of bone tissues.
The resorption process involves the proliferation and chemotaxis of developing osteoclasts
to the skeleton from hematopoietic sites migration of mature cells to sites of subsequent
resorption, attachment of osteoclasts to bone substrate and the eventual formation of the
polarized, functional mature end cells which are directly involved in bone resorption. The
αvβ3 integrin mediates adhesion of osteoclasts to RGD sequence-containing bone matrix
