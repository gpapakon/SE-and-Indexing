<ABSTRACT>
A portable telephone includes a telephone body, 
a receiver unit, a supporting mechanism and a display 

unit. The telephone body includes a transmitter attached 
to one end thereof and an antenna attached to the other 

end thereof. The telephone body includes at least one 
aperture defined on one side surface thereof so as to 

communicate with the transmitter. The receiver unit has a 
receiver attached thereto and is provided on the other end 

of said telephone body. The supporting mechanism supports 
the receiver of the receiving unit such that the receiver 

is projected from the telephone body not only in the 
direction away from the antenna but also with a 

predetermined angle with respect to the longitudinal 
direction of the telephone body. The display unit is 

provided on side surface of the telephone body. A part of 
the display unit is covered with the receiver unit when 

the portable telephone is in the telephone call standby 
mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to portable
telephones and, particularly to a portable telephone
having a movable portion.A wide variety of radio communication system
devices have hitherto been proposed to make a mobile
communication. Radio communication system devices, such
as mobile telephones, personal radio transceivers and
portable telephones, in particular, of a stationary type,
a shoulder type or a handy type are now commercially
available on the market.Figure 1 shows an example of a portable
telephone that is now in general use. While personal
transceivers make a communication by using the 90 MHz
band, mobile telephones and portable telephones make a
communication by using the 800 MHz band and antennas of
the mobile telephone and the portable telephone are
relatively short in length.In Figure 1, reference numeral 1 generally
depicts a portable telephone which is of a handy type
cordless telephone. As shown in Figure 1, this portable
telephone 1 includes an outer casing 2 of a rectangular
box configuration made of synthetic resin. The outer
casing 2 includes a front panel 2a, and the front panel 2a
has a receiver 3 provided on its upper end face so as to
be housed in the outer casing 2. The telephone 1 includes
an operation key group 4 disposed at its substantially
central position. The operation key group 4 includes a
plurality of operation keys, such as ten keys or the like.
The telephone 1 includes a transmitter (microphone) 5
provided on its lower surface side so as to be housed in
the outer casing 2. The telephone 1 includes an antenna 6 upwardly
extended from the upper surface portion of the outer
casing 2. Some portable telephones include a liquid
crystal display (LCD) unit provided on the front panel 2a
of the outer casing 2 in order to display information
entered by the user, though not shown.The portable telephone 1 thus arranged includes the
receiver 3 and the transmitter 5 both of which are housed
within the outer casing 2. Therefore, the outer casing 2
has to be long enough to the extent that it can
substantially cover the length between the user's ears and
mouth. As a result, the whole portable telephone 1
becomes too large in size to be put into user's suitable
carrying means, such as a purse or the like.To solve the above-mentioned problem, there is
proposed a portable telephone which includes a telephone
body composed of two telephone body portions joined by a
hinge. These two telephone body portions are rotated to
open when this portable telephone is in use.DE-A-34,01,518
