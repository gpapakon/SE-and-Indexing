<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for recording multiple channels (305) of digital audio data onto one-half inch tape using a rotary head recorder. The tape format includes sector spaces (306) and a write timing sector (308) to provide reduced susceptibility to errors arising from head misalignment, provides improved punch-in and punch-out capabilities using overdub identification values (415) recorded within each channel of audio information, and provides a unique time code word (420) that facilitates accurate high-speed scan and search operations, as well as multiple device synchronization. Each pair of audio tracks (203) terminates with a write timing sector that serves as an absolute location marker for the rotary head, and allows the digital audio system to determine precise head location with respect to the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a storage tape and a method of forming a digital format pattern on a
storage tape for use by a digital recording system.A full fidelity digital audio recorder requires a 1 MHz storage bandwidth
per recorded audio channel. Because a rotary head digital recorder has a wide
bandwidth, it is an ideal storage device for digital audio signals. Using digital
processing techniques, an audio signal is converted into a digital format and
recorded onto a magnetic medium. Upon playback, the digital signal is
converted first to a corrected digital audio bit stream and then to an analog
waveform.The high bandwidth required to effectively record a digital audio signal
necessitates a high tape speed. Rotary head recorders achieve a high
bandwidth as a result of high relative head-to-tape speed. Media recorded
using a rotary head can achieve 60,000 flux transitions/inch, about the same as
stationary head recording, but track density may reach 2,000 tracks/inch, or
about 10 times that of stationary head recording. Data transfer rates of 1 to 4
Mbytes/second are obtained, as the rotary head records the digital audio data
onto the tape using a technique called helical scanning. In helical scanning,
two or more electromagnetic heads are positioned on a head cylinder. The
head cylinder is rotated at a speed (e.g., 3,000 revolutions/ minute) that allows
the use of a lower tape speed while still maintaining a high relative head-to-tape
speed. As shown in Figure 1, the tape is helically wrapped around a
portion of the cylindrical drum.Helical scanning records diagonally aligned tracks onto the tape.
Because the tape is guided past the heads at an angle, each recorded track is 
placed diagonally across the tape width. Figure 2 illustrates the diagonal tracks
created by helical scanning. Each of the two heads on the cylinder alternately
lays down a track 201 onto the tape 202. Each pair of tracks 203 represents a
specified amount of audio signal. The tracks are recorded side by side without
any space separation.When re-recording a signal onto digital tape, the new signal is recorded
over the signal previously recorded on the tape. The accumulation of debris
on the tape can cause a media dropout, or recording omission, so that the new
data is not properly recorded and old data is therefore not completely erased.
After the re-recording operation is performed, and the debris is removed from
the surface of the magnetic tape, the read head may detect old data on the track
at the point where the dropout
