<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vertical bipolar transistor and a method for the production thereof. The aim of the invention is to produce a vertical bipolar transistor and to disclose a method for the production thereof, whereby excellent high frequency properties can be obtained for said transistor using the simplest possible production technology involving an implanted epitaxy-free collector and only one polysilicon layer spread over a large surface and which can be easily integrated into a conventional mainstream CMOS process without epitaxially produced trough areas. It is possible to simplify technology, while at the same time improving the high frequency parameters of vertical bipolar transistors by reducing the parasitic lateral and vertical components of the resistance of the collector, by means of a self-adjusting transistor construction in conjunction with a special method of production, whereby a highly doped monocrystalline base connection area surrounding the active base in a ring-like manner is removed in the region of the collector connection by reactive ion etching, together with the underlying less doped area of the collector or a part thereof.
