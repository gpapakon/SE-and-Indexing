<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new inclusion complexes of cyclodextrin, to a 
process for their preparation and to their use, particularly in slow release 
formulation for the treatment of Lepidopterous pests. The olive is a tree of very special social and economical significance for 
the Mediterranean countries of the European Economic Community, where it 
occupies about 65% of the total world surface devoted to this crop and produces 
approximately 80% of the world production of olive oil and almost 50% of the 
world production of pickled olives. Thus any development which could reduce agricultural input costs, while 
increasing production and quality of fruits and hence oil would be of great 
economic significance both within the community and in respect to its external 
trade. This particularly applies for high quality olive oil (pesticide free olive oil). Control of the Lepidopterous olive pests depends almost entirely on the 
use of pesticides. Their wide-spread use has already produced some serious 
problems in water contamination and food supplies in several locations of the 
olive growing countries. One of the most serious effects of using exclusively 
chemical insecticides for the olive pest control has been the development of pest 
resistance to the pesticides, the consequence of which has been the use of higher 
dosages which increases the environmental pollution and also affects severely 
the natural enemy complex with subsequent appearance of secondary pests. Prays oleae is known to be a serious olive pest. The female produces and 
releases a sex pheromone which attracts the male. The major component of this 
pheromone is known and is Z-7-tetradecenal. The jasmine moth Palpita unionalis [Lepidoptera: Pyralidae] is an olive 
pest in all the Mediterranean countries. It attach the leaves of young olive trees 
and also green olives. The biology and ecology of this pest have been poorly 
studied. Control of this pest depends upon insecticide treatment. Extensive 
behavioral and chemical studies under laboratory and field conditions reveal that 
the females produce and release a sex pheromone which attracts the males. Up 
to now, the isolation and identification of the chemical components which 
compose the sex pheromone of the Palpita unionalis, had never been carried 
out.  
 The techniques which are used up to now to control the olive fruit pests, 
i.e. respectively Prays oleae and Palpita unionalis, are not quite adequate for 
the above-stated reasons, and particularly because they create water,
