<ABSTRACT>
In an internal combustion engine with cartridge-type camshaft drive, with at least one cartridge unit (4 and 5) fixable to the engine block (1), in which unit the drive and output pinions (21 and 23) are arranged preassemblable with attached chain (22), a chain guide (11) and a chain tensioning device (33) and can be fixed to the engine block (1) and to the cylinder head (2) by means of bolts (12), the cartridge unit (4) with the preassembled components of the chain drive can be laterally inserted from above radially towards the drive shaft into a chain well (6) in the engine block (1) and accommodated in a chain well (7) in the cylinder head (2) and can be fixed by means of at least two bolts (12 and 18) running parallel to the drive shaft.

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine having at least one overhead
camshaft and camshaft chain drive cassettes, comprising at

least one cassette unit (4 or 5) in which the drive and
driven sprockets (21 and 23 or 42 and 43) with the chain (22

or 42) placed thereon, a chain guide (11 or 32) and a part
of a chain tensioning device (13 o
r 33) are arranged so
that they can be preassembled, the drive and driven

sprockets (21 and 23 or 42 and 43) being non-rotatably
connectable to their shafts and the parts of the cassette

units (4 or 5) being fixable to the engine block (1) and to
the cylinder head (2 or 3) by means of at least two screw

bolts,

characterised in that

the at least one cassette unit (4 or 5) with the
preassembled components of the chain drive can be

inserted sideways from above, in a direction radial to
the drive shaft, into a chain chamber (6 or 8) in the

engine block (1) and is accommodated in a chain
chamber (7 or 9) in the cylinder head (2 or 3) and the

drive and driven sprockets (21 and 23 or 42 and 43)
can be placed on their shafts axially and centred and

screwed thereon.
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1,

characterised in that

each cassette unit (4 or 5) comprises:
a base plate (10 or 30) with a chain guide (11 or 31)
fitted directly thereon;
a chain tensioning rail (13 or 33) connected to the
base plate (11 or 31) by means of a pivot/screw bolt

(12 or 32)so as to swivel thereon; and 
the preassembled drive and driven sprockets (21 and 23
or 41 and 43) and the chain (22 or 42) placed thereon,

the latter being held with axial play by means of the
chain (22) fixed by the chain guide (11) and the chain

tensioning rail (13).
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1 or
claim 2,

characterised in that

the base plate (10 or 30) of the cassette units (4 or
5) comprises a metal plate or a plastics plate, on to

which the chain guides (11 or 31) of a plastics
material are injection moulded, clipped or fastened or

with which they are formed integrally,
the chain tensioning rails (13 or 33) consist of
plastics material and are arranged to swivel about a

metal bushing (16 or 36) inserted in the base plate
(10 or 30),
the metal bushing (16 or 36) serves at the same time
to fasten the cassette units to the engine block (1)

by means of a screw bolt (12 or 32) and
a securing bushing (17 or 37) is fitted in the upper
part of the base plate (10 or 30), said bushing being

provided for securing the cassette units to the
cylinder head (2 or 3) by means of screw bolts (18 or

38) by means of a tongue and groove joint (19/20 or
39/40) providing for length compensation.
An internal combustion engine according to claim 2 or
claim 3,

characterised in that

the screw bolts (12 and 18) can be tightened through
bores in a wall of the chain chambers (8 and 9) and

the bores closed by an O-ring seal at the head end of
the screw bolt (12) or by a pressed-in stopper of

sheet metal or plastics material.
