<ABSTRACT>
A transurethral needle ablation device (31) for the treatment of the prostate of a human male using radio frequency energy comprising a sheath (32) having a lumen (36) extending therethrough. A guide tube assembly (51, 52) is slidably mounted in the lumen in the sheath and having a lumen extending therethrough. A needle electrode (116) is slidably mounted in the lumen (84) in the guide tube assembly. An insulating sheath (83) is disposed about the needle electrode so that the distal extremity of the needle electrode is exposed, whereby when the sheath is positioned in the urethra with its distal extremity in the vicinity of the prostate, the needle electrode can be advanced through the urethral wall and into the tissue of the prostate to permit the application of radio frequency energy to the tissue of the prostate surrounding the needle electrode to form a lesion in the prostate.
