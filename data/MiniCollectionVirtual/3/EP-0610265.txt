<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses novel substituted aryl- and heteroarylphenyloxazolidinones which are useful as antibacterial agents. More specifically, the substituted aryl- and heteroarylphenyloxazolidinones of the invention are characterized by oxazolidinones having an aryl or heteroaryl group at the p-position of the 3-phenyl ring and additional substitutions at the m-position(s) of the 3-phenyl ring. A compound representative of this new class of oxazolidinones is (+/-)-5-(acetamidomethyl)-3-[4-(3-pyridyl)-3,5-difluorophenyl]-2-oxazo lidinone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel substituted aryl- and heteroarylphenyloxazolidinones 
which are useful as anti-bacterial agents. The oxazolidinones are a class of orally-active, synthetic antibacterial agents and there 
are numerous references in the art disclosing a variety of oxazolidinone derivatives. For 
example, there are a number of references to 3-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone compounds having one 
or two substitutions on the phenyl ring. References disclosing a single substitution to the phenyl 
ring include U.S. Patent 4,948,801; 4,461,773; 4,340,606; 4,476,136; 4,250,318; 4,128,654, and 
Re 29,607. Additional references to 3-[(monosubstituted)phenyl]-2-oxazolidinones can be found 
in EP Publication 0 312 000, Gregory, et al., J. Med. Chem. 32:1673 (1989), Gregory, et al., J. 
Med. Chem. 33:2569 (1990), and Wang, et al., Tetrahedron 45:1323 (1989). Compounds of this 
type also include the antibacterial DuP721. 3-[(di- or fused-ring substituted)phenyl]-2-oxazolidinones are reported in U.S. Patents 
4,977,173, 4,921,869, and 4,801,600; EP Publications 0 316 594, 0 184 170, and 0 127 902; and 
PCT Applications PCT/US89/03548 and PCT/US90/06220. We have discovered 3-[(di- and tri-substituted)phenyl]-2-oxazolidinones which are 
effective as antibacterial agents. The compounds of the invention are characterized by oxazolidinones 
having an aryl or heteroaryl group at the p-position of the 3-phenyl ring and additional 
substitution(s) at the m-position of the phenyl ring with radicals having an electron-withdrawing 
effect. These compounds are surprisingly effective as antibacterial agents, since early work by 
Gregory, et al, J. Med. Chem. 33:2569 (1990), suggests compounds having such radicals in the 
p-position of the phenyl ring are less effective antibacterial agents. Synthesis of 3-phenyl-2-oxazolidinones and derivatives thereof are well known in the 
art. However, due to the nature of the radicals, the substituted phenyls of the invention are 
difficult to synthesize. Thus, we also disclose a process by which the compounds of the 
invention may be synthesized. The following references disclose 3-phenyl-2-oxazolidinones having a single substitution 
on the phenyl ring: U.S. Patent 4,948,801 discloses 3-[(aryl and heteroaryl)phenyl]-2-oxazolidinones having 
antibacterial activity. U.S. Patent 4,476,136 discloses 3-[(p-arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, and arylacetylenic 
substituted)phenyl]-5-(aminomethyl)-2-oxazolidinones which have antibacterial activity. U.S. Patent 4,461,773 discloses substituted
