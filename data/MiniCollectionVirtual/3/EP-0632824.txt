A liquid dishwashing detergent bades on an aqueous solution of 
anionic surfactants, optionally together with nonionic and/or 

amhoteric surfactants, solvents, solubilizers, corrosion inhibitors, 
preservatives, thickeners and also dyes and fragrances, 

characterized in that it additionally cotains 0.001 to 1.0% by weight 
of a detergency-boosting practically uncrosslinked copolymer of
 
a) esters of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid containing 

1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alcohol component and b) 
unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids containing 3 to 5 

carbon atoms with an intrinsic viscosity [η] of ≥ 400 

ml·g
-1
, as measured in tetrahydrofuran at 20°C. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it contains a copolymer of 80 to 20% by weight and 

preferably 60 to 40% by weight of a) and 20 to 80% by 
weight and preferably 40 to 60% by weight of b). 
A detergent as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the alcohol component of the esters a) 

contains 1 to 2 carbon atoms. 
A detergent as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acid 

components of the copolymers emanate from acrylic or 
methacrylic acid. 
A detergent as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that it consists of an aqueous solution of 

5 to 65% by weight and more particularly 10 to 40% by 
weight of a mixture consisting of at least two of the 

following surfactants: 

0 to 40% by weight and preferably 5 to 20% by weight of 
a mixture of 50 parts by weight of a sulfated adduct of 

1 to 5 and preferably 2 to 4 moles of ethylene oxide with 
an n C
12
 alkanol and of a corresponding adduct with an n 
C
14
 alkanol, 
0 to 40% by weight and preferably 5 to 20% by weight of 
one or more anionic surfactants,  

 
0 to 20% by weight and preferably 1 to 5% by weight of an 
amphoteric surfactant, 
0 to 20% by weight and preferably 0 to 5% by weight of a 
nonionic surfactant, 
0.005 to 0.5% by 
weight of a detergency-boosting water-soluble anionic 

copolymer of a) around 80 to 20% by weight and preferably 
around 60 to 40% by weight of esters of acrylic and/or 

methacrylic acid containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 
1 to 4 carbon atoms and more particularly 1 to 2 

carbon atoms in the alcohol component and b) around 20 to 
80% by weight and pr
eferably around 40 to 60% by weight 
of unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids containing 3 to 

5, carbon atoms in the acyl component with an intrinsic 
viscosity [η]
 of ≥ 400 ml·g
-1
, as measured in THF at 20°C, 
0 to 20% by weight and preferably 2 to 10% by weight of 
a solvent, 
0 to 10% by weight and preferably 0.2 to 5% by weight of 
a solubilizer, 
0 to 10% by weight and preferably 0.5 to 8% by weight of 
a thickener, 
0 to 5% by weight and preferably 0.1 to 2% by weight of 
corrosion inhibitors and preservatives, 
0 to 0.1% by weight of dye, 
0 to 1.0% by weight of perfume oil and 
 
balance to 100% by weight water.
