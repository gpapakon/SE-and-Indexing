<ABSTRACT>
Hinge for doors or windows, having a frame hinge part (1) and a leaf/sash hinge part (2) which is connected to the frame hinge part (1) in an articulated manner. The leaf/sash hinge part (2) is made up of an abutment part (5) which can be fixed on the leaf/sash and of an adjustment part (6) which is guided displaceably with respect to the abutment part (5) and can be adjusted in a stepless manner by means of an adjustment drive and can be fixed by means of a fixing screw (12). The adjustment drive exhibits a sliding block (8) which is guided displaceably in the abutment part (5), parallel to the articulation axis (7), and can be displaced at right angles to the articulation axis (7) by means of an adjustment element which can be rotated with the aid of a tool applied from the front side of the adjustment part (6). In the case of a hinge which can be produced cost-effectively and operates reliably the adjustment element is an eccentric (10) which is mounted rotatably in the adjustment part (6) via a cylindrial body (25), coaxial with respect to the axis of rotation (9) of the eccentric (10), and which engages rotatably in a cylindrical cutout (19) of the sliding block (8) via a cylindrical protrusion (18) arranged eccentrically with respect to the axis of rotation (9).

An adjustable hinge joint for doors or windows, comprising 
a frame joint portion (1) to be attached to the frame and a 

wing joint portion (2) to be attached to the leaf or wing, 
said wing joint portion (2) being hingedly connected with the 

frame joint portion (1) and consisting of an abutment portion 
(5) fixable to the leaf or wing and an adjusting portion (6) 

comprising the wing-side hinge portion, the adjusting portion 
(6) being guided displaceably with respect to the abutment 

portion (5) at right angles to the hinge axis (7), being 
continuously adjustable by means of a self-locking adjusting 

drive supported on the abutment portion (5) and being 
securable with respect to the abutment portion (5) by means 

of at least one clamping screw (12) passing through an 
elongate hole (11) in the adjusting portion (6), the 

adjusting drive comprising a sliding pad (8) guided in the 
abutment portion (5) so as to be displaceable in parallel 

with the hinge axis, said sliding pad (8) interacting with a 
regulating element mounted in the adjusting portion (6) and 

rotatable by means of a tool attached from the front of the 
adjusting portion (6), characterised in that the regulating 

element is an eccentric (10) which is mounted rotatably in 
the adjusting portion (6) by means of a cylindrical part (25) 

coaxial with the axis of rotation (9) of the eccentric (10) 
and engages rotatably in a cylindrical recess (19) in the 

sliding pad (8) by means of a cylindrical projection (18) 
arranged eccentrically with respect to the axis of rotation 

(9). 
A hinge joint according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a toothed disk (21) is arranged between the eccentric (10) 

and the sliding pad (8), which toothed disk (21) blocks the  
 

eccentric (10) if the moment of the door leaf or window wing 
presses on the eccentric (10). 
A hinge joint according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the eccentric (10) is provided with a 

radially projecting cam (22) which moves freely into a semi-annular 
recess (24) in the wall of the adjusting portion (6) 

and strikes against limit stops (26, 27) at each end of this 
recess (24). 
A hinge joint according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cam (22) forms a pointer which 

interacts with a scale (28) which is attached to the edge of 
the semi-annular recess.
