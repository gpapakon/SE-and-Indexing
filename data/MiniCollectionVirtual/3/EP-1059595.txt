<ABSTRACT>
A computerized method is provided which enables Dynamic Property values to
remain valid for some time after they have been computed, thus avoiding recomputation and

inconsistencies. The method caches Dynamic Property values and associates them with a
certain caching policy which determines if the cached value is valid. In a first step at system

initialization time, Dynamic Properties are specified in terms of their name, their type, the
DPE used for computation, and a set of actual parameters needed to exercise this

computation. In a second step at run-time, if the policy indicates that the cached value is still
valid, the following additional data is stored: (a) the previously computed value, and (b) the

caching or expiration policy for the cached data. In a third step at run-time, if the policy
indicates that the cached value is expired, the value is computed again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for facilitating e-commerce and, more specifically, to
methods which allow customers using Virtual Market Places to search for offers in a huge
offer-space populated by various providers. This search is targeted at narrowing down the
offer-space to a set of offers that match the customer's requirements. Conversely, for certain
offer types, especially non-product service-oriented offers, it is necessary to filter potential
clients by matching requirements associated with the service offer against client properties.
This is implemented by a match-making facility (an entity with the purpose of matching client
constraints with offer properties and offer constraints against client properties) which initiates
a match-making process at the heart of any Virtual Market Place architecture. The
match-making process is triggered when a client sends his requirements along with his
properties to the market place in which the available offers are stored at some match-making
facility.Properties of clients and offers are represented as typed name-value lists. Each
property is referred to by a unique property name. The property itself has a certain type such
as integer, string or a more complex structured type, and an associated value. The set of all
properties associated with a particular client is called a property set for the client. These
property sets are stored at a match-making facility to be used when a client searches for a
certain set of offers. The values of the properties are usually specified at export time, that is
when the provider advertises them at a match-making facility. Those properties are called
static properties.The value of dynamic properties will be computed at match-making time rather than
at export time. As opposed to static properties for which the values are provided at export 
time, dynamic properties are specified by providing an identification of a computation
algorithm, such as a reference to a Dynamic Property Evaluator (DPE) and a set of optional
parameters required for the computation. At match-making time the match-making facility (in
terms of ODP/CORBA as described in Object Management Group: The Common Object
Request Brokery Â¨: Architecture and Specification, Revision 2.0, 1995 and the trader as
described in Object Management Group: CORBA Trading Service, Doc. no. Orbos/06-05-06,
1996) will trigger the evaluation of any dynamic properties found and then use the computed
values for the match-making process.Traditionally, client or offer constraints
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A computerized property resolution method (10) for matching potential clients and
offers of products or services, the method encoded on a computer-readable medium wherein

values (14) of dynamic properties (16) are cached and associated with a certain caching policy
which determines if the cached value (14) is valid thus enabling the values to remain valid for

some time after they have been computed and avoiding unnecessary recomputation and
inconsistencies.
The method of claim 1, comprising the steps of:

(a) at initialization time, specifying dynamic properties (16) in terms of their name, their
type (24), the DPE used for computation, and a set of actual parameters (26) needed to

exercise this computation;
(b) at match-making time, if the policy indicates that the cached value (14) is still valid,
the following additional data is stored:


(i) the previously computed value (14) which was cached; and
(ii) the caching policy associated with the cached value; and
(c) at match-making time, if the policy indicates that the cached value (14) has expired, a
new value (14) is computed.
The method of claims 1 or 2 in which the following rules are followed:

(a) a dynamic property (16) is evaluated only if:

(i) the value (14) of the dynamic property (16) is not cached, or
(ii) the cached value (14) is not valid anymore, and
(b) the dynamic property (16) is evaluated at most once for a given constraint.
The method of claim 1 wherein property resolution is independent of any particular
representation format of expiration policies which indicate the validity of a cached property

value (14).
The method of claim 1 wherein the values (14) are computed and cached as long as
the offer is valid, thus facilitating the representation of offers in virtual market places which

are only available at a certain time or for a certain period of time.
A computerized immediate property resolution method (10) encoded on a
computer-readable medium wherein values of dynamic properties (16) are calculated and

cached for retrieval in a data structure (12) together with any values (48) of static properties,
thereby enabling the evaluation of constraints with respect to these values.
A deferred property resolution method (10) encoded on a computer-readable medium,
the method reducing the frequency of computation of values (14) of dynamic properties (16)

which are not actually used by a constraint, by:

(a) deferring property resolution until a value (14) is actually needed; and
(b) extending the validity of cached values for a time utilized to evaluate the constraint.
A data structure (12) encoded on a computer-readable medium, for storing dynamic
properties (16) and related data for access as required during an evaluation of a constraint in a

virtual market place, the data structure including:

(a) offer property sets (32) comprising:

(i) dynamic properties (16) having a name, a dynamic property evaluator reference (25)
and associated parameters (26), a type (24), and a value (14), and
(ii) static properties (44) having a name, type (24) and value (48); and
(b) client property sets (33) comprising static properties (44) and, optionally, dynamic
properties (16).
