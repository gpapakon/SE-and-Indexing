<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for electronically controlling an automatic gear box. Torque transmission is reduced when the engine throttle setting and vehicle speed are below a threshold. The transmitted torque causes the vehicle to crip slightly, warning the driver that a gear is engaged. The slant and load of the vehicle are taken into account for controlling the drive torque.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the electronic control of an automatic 
gearbox (10) in a vehicle comprising clutches controlled by 

a microprocessor (7), a drive position selector (1), a 
sensor (2) which detects the vehicle speed, a sensor (3) 

which detects the engine throttle setting, a sensor (4) 
which detects vehicle inclination, the microprocessor (7) 

regulating a clutch lying in the power flow path in such a 
way that, when the travel speed is zero or virtually zero 

and the engine throttle setting is zero or virtually zero, 
the transmitted torque balances the effects of inclination, 

wherein the vehicle weight and loading also influence 
control, characterised in that the load distribution is 

detected and used to correct the inclination of the 
vehicle. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 

that load-dependent adjustment of vehicle lighting (5) is 
used as a measure of the load situation. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a signal (5) for the load situation is obtained from 

levelling of the vehicle. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the inclination of the vehicle with respect to the 

road is determined by distance sensors (5).
