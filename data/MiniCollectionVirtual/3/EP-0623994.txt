<ABSTRACT>
Power amplifiers, which include a feedback element, may be 
protected from excessive operating power levels by adjusting the feedback 

element to reduce the drive signals to the power elements. This is 
accomplished by sensing the output power of the power amplifier to 

produce a sensing signal (300, 301). When the sensing signal exceeds a 
predetermined threshold (302), a feedback element is adjusted (304) to 

produce an increased feedback signal. The increased feedback signal is 
subtracted from an input signal (306), thus decreasing the drive signal. 

With the drive signal reduced, the output power is reduced proportional to 
the adjustment of the feedback element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to protection of power
amplifiers and, in particular, to protection of power amplifiers from
excessive operating power levels.Power amplifiers are used in transmitters to rebroadcast, at
high power levels, amplitude modulation (AM) signals, frequency
modulation (FM) signals, and quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM) signals. As is known, information is carried in the
amplitudes of AM and QAM signals. Because of this, transmitters
must accurately rebroadcast these signals, thus the power amplifiers
within the transmitters must have high fidelity, i.e. linearly
rebroadcast the signals they receive.To maintain linear performance, the power elements (usually
transistors) are operated at levels much below their rated output
power levels. Thus, to achieve high output power levels, many
power amplifiers include cascaded elements, such that the amplified
output of one element is the input of the next element. In this
manner, a small change in a first stage typically produces a large
change in the final stage output. For this reason, the power
amplifier utilizes a feedback control loop, which is regulated by a
power control circuit, to maintain output power levels. However, when changes exceed the limits of the
feedback control loop, damage can occur to the power
elements (transistors). Once damage has occurred, excessive
feedback signal levels produce power amplifier instability which
results in the destruction of the power amplifier.U.S. Patent 5,196,808 teaches a method for preventing
such destruction of a power amplifier. This patent discloses an
amplifier protector that continually monitors the peak forward
and reflected voltages of a transmitter output which are
proportional to the forward and reflected power. When an
associated processor determines that the forward voltage is
below a threshold voltage, the processor via an automatic level
control circuit turns off the power amplifier in a timely fashion to
prevent damage to the transmission circuitry. Such a solution
does indeed protect the power amplifier. However, depending
on the device in which the power amplifier operates, it may not
be desirable to turn off the power amplifier. In wireless
communication systems, for example, it is certainly desirable to
protect amplifier components from damage, but it is also
desirable to maintain communication service to the extent
possible.Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus that
provides protection of power amplifiers from excessive
operating power levels.FIG. 1
