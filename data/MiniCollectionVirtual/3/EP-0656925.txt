<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to hot melt adhesives
comprised of syndiotactic polymers and a
tackifier.A class of adhesive compositions known as
thermoplastic or hot melt adhesives have enjoyed
continually increasing usage in many industrial
applications. These adhesives, or hot melts, as
they are commonly designated, are solid or
semisolid combinations of film forming resins,
tackifying resins, rubbery polymers,
plasticizers, waxes and similar materials which
are added to the adhesive composition in order to
impart various properties thereto.Adhesive bonds derived from hot melts are
particularly useful because (1) they are 100
percent solid materials and (2) they quickly form
tough adhesive bonds simply by cooling--i.e. no
need for solvent evaporation, etc.Adhesive derived from hot melts are
particularly useful because of their very rapid
set up or bonding time. Strong bonds are formed
when the adhesive cools below its melt point and
crystallizes. There is no long wait for solvent
or water evaporation or for chemical curing as
with other type adhesives. Depending on
composition, hot melt adhesives can be prepared
having good tack, high bond 
strength, good flexibility, low temperature
properties, good environmental resistance etc.A typical class of hot melt adhesive
composition utilizes polyolefin polymers as the
base or carrier material. The polyolefin base is
usually blended with other polymers and
copolymers, resin tackifiers and with modifiers
and additives.Therefore, it is one object of the invention
to provide a hot melt adhesive having: (1) a high
softening temperature; (2) improved toughness;
(3) slow crystallization kinetics which result in
longer "open times" between the application of
the adhesives and the formation of the joint; or
(4) less shrinkage than corresponding isotactic
polypropylene or ethylene/vinyl acetate based
adhesives.These and other objects are accomplished by
the present invention which provides a hot melt
adhesive comprising syndiotactic polypropylene
having a polymer chain including at least 80%
racemic dyads and having a melting point of about
100°C to 180°C, preferably 100 to 160°C.Figure 1 is a graph depicting peel strength
as a function of open time for an isotactic
copolymer (17% hexene-1).Figure 2 is a graph depicting peel strength
as a function of open time for an syndiotactic
copolymer (17% hexene-1).Figure 3 and Figure 5 illustrate stress-strain
curves on a C3/C6 copolymer/ECR-lll system
containing 6% hexene. Figure 4 depicts the results of a study
