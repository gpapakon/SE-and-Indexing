<ABSTRACT>
An encoding scheme resistant to transmission errors encodes a data bitstream for application to a quadrature amplitude modulator (QAM) in a high definition television system. The error-resistant code provides a rotationally symmetrical 32-point constellation on a plane defined by I, Q quadrature axes. The constellation is divided into first (A) and second (B) partitions arranged so that constellation points that are closest in distance to any constellation point of the first partition belong to the second partition, and constellation points that are closest in distance to any constellation point of the second partition belong to the first partition. The binary value of one bit of each of successive 9-bit packets in the bitstream determines that one of the two partitions (A, B) to which both of a consecutive pair of first and second constellation-point transmissions belong (the first and second transmitted constellation-points of that consecutive pair being selected by the then current 9-bit packet of the stream). The code is such that the binary values of such one bit of each of alternate ones of the successive 9-bit packets are opposite to one another. This permits a receiver decoder to decide whether each received constellation-point belongs to a first or a second constellation, thereby permitting the detection and, in most cases, the correction of transmission errors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encoder for
encoding a stream of information data bits to be applied to a
quadrature amplitude modulator (QAM). In particular, the
invention concerns such an encoder and associated decoder which
may be employed in a high-definition television system.Simulcast broadcast of 6 MHz channel-bandwidth
television signals employing both a standard (NTSC) analog format
and a high-definition television (HDTV) digital format has been
proposed. The HDTV format requires (1) that the television data
be processed into a data-compressed form in order to fit within a
standard 6 MHz channel, and (2) that the HDTV format be chosen
to minimize interference with an NTSC-format signal being
simultaneously broadcast over the same channel as an HDTV-format
signal. An HDTV transmitter and receiver system designed
for simulcast broadcasting, which employs QAM and which meets
both of the two aforesaid requirements, is disclosed in copending
U.S. patent application 07/650,329, filed February 4, 1991, (WO92/14343) which
is assigned to the same assignee as the present application.In such disclosed HDTV system, the digital QAM
channel signal at the transmitter is converted to analog form
before being transmitted over the air to the receiver, where it is
converted back to digital form. Because of transmission factors
such as noise, errors can occur that cause the received QAM signal
not to exactly match the transmitted QAM signal.Known in the art are a number of block coded modulation
techniques. EP-A-0122805 discloses an arrangement for sending a block of
digital data bits over a band-limited channel using a plurality of modulation
signal points from a two-dimensional constellation of signals in which the
constellation includes groups having equal numbers of signals. The Philips
Journal of Research, Vol.45, NO.2, Sept. 1990 (Pgs. 127-155) in an article
by Chouly et al. discloses a method to implement two block coded
modulation families and includes a rotationally invariant code design to
demodulate the received signal. US Patent 4,562,426 relates to transmitted
digital symbols including encoding symbols into discrete signals and in
which dependencies are provided between successive signals in the
sequence to increase immunity to noise and distortion.The invention concerns a video signal apparatus comprising :
means for providing a bitstream of symbols representing video
data, each of said symbols representing plural bits, andmodulation means responsive to said symbol bitstream for
producing a
