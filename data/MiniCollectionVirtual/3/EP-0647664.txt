<ABSTRACT>
Hybrid polymers of epoxy resins are provided by polymerizing 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the presence of epoxy resin using a 

combination of oil soluble and water soluble surfactants in separate 
organic and aqueous phases, respectively, made up prior to combining under 

polymerizing conditions. The organic phase contains the monomer and epoxy 
resin and oil soluble surfactant while the aqueous phase contains water and 

the water soluble surfactant. Initiator systems can be included in the 
organic phase or added independently to the reaction mixture. The 

resulting hybrid epoxy polymer exhibits excellent properties when applied 
as a protective film or adhesive, and aqueous dispersions of the polymer 

can be compounded with polyfunctional amine curatives and still remain 
stable for long periods of time, making a convenient one-pack system that 

can be cured on application, drying and heating at a relatively low 
temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a hybrid polymer of an 
epoxy resin. In another aspect it relates to preparing a stable aqueous 
dispersion of an epoxy-based hybrid polymer which is suitable for forming 
adhesive and protective films. In yet other aspects it relates to the 
products which result from these methods in the form of a hybrid polymer, 
an aqueous polymer dispersion and a protective film. Epoxy resins are widely used in industry for numerous applications 
including coatings and laminating adhesives. Manufacturers are not content 
simply to adapt their processes to the epoxy products available but insist 
that such resins be tailored to meet their needs. To remain competitive it 
is essential that suppliers of epoxy resins continually improve their 
products with their customers' requirements in mind. One approach for modifying epoxy polymer products has been by 
combining the epoxy resin with other polymers which provide certain 
advantages in their physical properties and processibility. This is 
complicated by another objective which is to place the combined polymers in 
aqueous dispersion for handling and use in order to avoid toxicity and fire 
hazards associated with organic solvents. Such combinations often have 
three serious disadvantages. One is incompatibility of the combined 
polymers, resulting in the final products having inferior mechanical 
strength and poor appearance. A second problem is instability of 
emulsions of the combined polymers owing to incompatibility of emulsions of 
each of the component polymers. The third difficulty frequently 
encountered is inadequate curing of the hybrid polymer because of the 
surfactant or emulsifier layer on the polymer particles of each 
constituent. In the past these problems have been addressed in different 
ways involving various polymerization recipes and blending sequences.  Evans, et al., U.S. 4,212,781 (1980) describes a method of modifying 
epoxy resins by graft polymerization. The addition monomer, such as an 
acrylate system, is polymerized by free radical initiation in the presence 
of the epoxy resin, either in the absence of a solvent or, preferably, in a 
two part system of miscible solvents, one of which dissolves the epoxy 
resin and the other the addition monomer, for example, benzene and ethanol. 
The product is said to be a blend of graft polymer, ungrafted polymerized 
addition polymer and unreacted epoxy resin. This solution of mixed 
polymers can be converted to an aqueous system by replacing the
