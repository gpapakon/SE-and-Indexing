<ABSTRACT>
A bimodal portable telephone provides cellular service and improved 
cordless service in a common handset (107). Operation of the bimodal portable 

telephone in a cellular telephone system provides telephone service over a wide 
geographical area of coverage through operation with multiple cellular bases (104), 

and in a cordless telephone system provides telephone service over a localized 
geographical area of coverage through operation with an associated cordless base 

(115). The cordless service provides improved performance over conventional 
cordless telephone service by advantageously employing a frequency hopping spread 

spectrum modulation technique for communications between the portable telephone 
(107) and the cordless base unit (115). This improved performance achieves 

increased operating range of the cordless telephone system. This increased operating 
range is particularly advantageous to the user of the portable telephone in that it 

permits this more economical system to be used over a much greater distance than is 
possible with conventional cordless telephone service. Also, commonality of 

circuitry within the portable telephone is facilitied through the selection of operating 

frequencies for the cordless telephone system to be in close proximity with those of 
the cellular telephone system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to portable telephones arranged for operation in 
wireless communication systems and more particular to a portable telephone 
arranged for operation in dissimilar wireless communication systems. Portable telephones are used in a variety of wireless communication 
systems. These communication systems include cellular radio systems and present-day 
cordless telephone systems which are growing in popularity; both having 
achieved broad customer acceptance. Both of these systems have different protocol 
interface requirements, however. Various types of cellular radio systems have been described which 
provide radio telephone service to a large number of mobile subscribers using a 
relatively small number of frequencies. Such service is provided by dividing the 
service area into a number of cells and reusing the frequencies in non-adjacent cells. 
Once such system is described in The Bell Systems Technical Journal, Volume 58, 
January 1979, Number 1, particularly in papers entitled "Advanced Mobile Phone 
Service: Introduction, Background and Objectives" by W. R. Young and "The 
Cellular Concept" by V. H. MacDonald. Although a cellular radio system is capable of satisfactorily providing 
telephone service to portable telephones over a wide area, a portable telephone 
operating in such system has to perform a number of complex procedures. These 
include registering with the closest cellular base station and communicating with this 
base station which, in turn, is arranged to receive, set-up or hand-off a telephone call. 
The base station equipment also has to perform a number of complex procedures for 
carrying out these functions in the cellular radio system. Thus telephone service in a 
cellular radio system is complex and, for the present, expensive. Cordless radio systems have been available in the art for some time. 
One such system was first described in, for example, Telephony, July 22, 1967, 
pages 38, 54 and 55, in an article entitled "Bell Labs is Developing New Lineless 
Telephone". In this article, the lineless telephone is described as performing the 
major functions or a regular telephone set, to wit, the unit connects with the 
telephone network via a radio link to a fixed station. This fixed station, in turn, is 
connected to a telephone line or extension line. This lineless telephone also provides  
 
simultaneous two-way conversation, as well as supervision (connecting and 
disconnection), dialing and ringing. Present-day cordless telephone arrangements, such as is

A portable telephone handset (107) including: 
   circuit means for communicating with a first base station (115) 

configured for operation in a frequency hopping system and for communicating with 
a second base station (104) configured for operation in a cellular radio system; and
