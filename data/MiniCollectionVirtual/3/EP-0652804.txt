<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a process for disposing of environmentally harmful substances adsorbed in particulate adsorbants which causes as few new problems as possible for the environment, the adsorbants loaded with environmentally harmful substances run through a moving bed reactor, a hot gas current flows through the moving bed reactor, thus thermally desorbing the environmentally harmful substances, the environmentally harmful substances desorbed from the adsorbants form with the current of hot gas a gas enriched with environmentally harmful substances and are recirculated again through the moving bed reactor through which the adsorbants are conveyed, and a partial amount of the current of enriched gas is diverted from the circuit in order to recover or to further process the environmentally harmful substances.

A disposal method for environmental pollutant(s) adsorbed
on adsorbing agents in particle form by means of desorption,

using a recirculating recycle gas stream passing through a
moving-bed reactor countercurrently to the adsorbing agent and

with feeding in of a flushing gas, and tapping off a part
quantity from the circulation for the recovery or further

processing of the environmental pollutant(s), wherein the
adsorbing agent still contaminated with the environmental

pollutant(s) is passed through a moving-bed reactor combining
several stages and comprising an incoming flow- and discharge

bottom, wherein bulk material discharge openings for
discharging the bulk material from an upper stage (partial

bed) serve as bulk material feed openings for the stage
(partial bed) located thereben
eath, and with heat being
directly introduced into the moving-bed reactor and the

recycle gas stream being a hot gas stream, the hot gas stream
flows through the moving-bed reactor with thermal desorption

of the environmental pollutant(s) and the simultaneous
formation of a rich gas enriched with the environmental

pollutant(s), and the hot waste gases of a gas burner are used
as a flushing gas introducing the heat into the moving-bed

reactor.
A disposal method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the recycle gas stream passing through the moving-bed

reactor is acted upon with a gas containing oxygen, such as
air or pure oxygen, and at least some of the adsorbing agent

is burned with oxygen, generating heat for the thermal
desorption.
A disposal method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the recycle gas stream passing through

the moving-bed reactor is acted upon with a reactant to
activate the adsorbing agent. 
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that some of the environmental pollutants

which are to be desorbed or have been desorbed are destroyed
by means of chemical transformation.
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the bulk material discharge from the

desorbing moving-bed reactor extends into the bulk material
inlet of a moving-bed reactor located therebeneath for cooling

the desorbed adsorbing agent.
A disposal method according to claim 5, characterized in
that a slight overpressure of the cooling gas in the region of

the said bulk material inlet relative to the gas pressure in
the region of the said bulk material discharge is maintained

so that a small amount of the cooling gas from the cooling
moving-bed reactor enters the desorbing moving-bed reactor.
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the bulk material discharge from the

desorbing moving-bed reactor extends into the bulk material
inlet of a moving-bed reactor located therebeneath for cooling

the desorbed adsorbing agent.
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the gas stream forming the hot gas

stream is heated before it enters the moving-bed reactor.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that the heating is effected partly by indirect heat

exchange with a cooling stage for the desorbed adsorbing
agent.
A disposal method according to claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that the heating is effected at least partly

by means of a gas burner. 
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that raising the temperature or adjusting the

temperature in the moving-bed reactor is effected by acting
upon the recycle gas stream passing through the moving-bed

reactor with an additional substance.
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the recycle gas stream passing through

the moving-bed reactor is acted upon with steam.
A disposal method according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that oxygen in excess is supplied to the

flushing gas.
