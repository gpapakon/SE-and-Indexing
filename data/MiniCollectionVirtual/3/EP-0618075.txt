<ABSTRACT>
An integrated printhead (10) which includes an M row 
by N column array of groups (18) of ink jet elements (30) 

wherein each group (18) has a unique row and column address; 
a first addressing control (12) coupled to the array of groups 

(18) for selecting one of the M rows of the M row by N column 
array of groups (18) of ink jet elements (30); and a second 

addressing control (14) coupled to the array of groups (18) 
for selecting one of the N columns for the M row by N column 

array of groups (18) of ink jet elements (30). One individual 
group (18) of ink jet elements (30) is addressed by the first 

addressing (12) and the second addressing (14) controls. In 
a specific embodiment a third dimension of addressing is 

provided by a plurality of address line controls (16) that are 
coupled to the ink jet elements (30) in each group (18). In 

an alternate specific embodiment the resistance (26) between 
the first addressing control (12) and the second addressing 

control (14) for each group (18) of ink jet elements (30) can 
be adjusted to balance the energy dissipated between the 

groups (18) of ink jet elements (30). The unique three 
dimensional addressing system provides for high density 

integrated printheads (10) that have significantly fewer 
interconnect pads, which minimizes cost and increases 

reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal inkjet printing 
and more particularly to the selection for activation of 
heater resistors within an inkjet printhead to expel ink 
from nozzles corresponding to the heater resistors. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention 
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in 
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional 
fields in which the present invention would be of 
significant utility. A major goal in an inkjet printer is to maximize 
print quality and speed while minimizing cost. To 
achieve this, more ink drop spray nozzles must be added 
to the pen while minimizing the circuit area needed. A 
major factor in chip area is the area of the interconnect 
pads which connect the die to the pen tape automated 
bonding (TAB) circuit. Decreasing the amount of 
interconnect pads on the chip not only reduces die area 
and cost but also tape automated bonding (TAB) circuit 
area as well as drive electronics in the product. The 
integrated drive head (IDH) is a means of reducing the 
printhead interconnect pads through the use of switching 
transistors formed on an integrated circuit substrate. 
The basic circuit consists of a heater resistor in series  
 
with a field effect transistor (FET) which controls the 
current through the resistor. By allowing current to 
flow through this resistor, power is dissipated in the 
resistor heating the ink and ejecting it through a 
nozzle. In the pen there are hundreds of these circuits. A conventional printhead has 200 nozzles and is 
designed with 8 groups of 25 pairs each consisting of a 
heater resistor in series with a field effect transistor 
(FET). Each group has 1 primitive select, 1 ground and 
25 address lines which are shared between all groups. 
Therefore for 8 groups of 25 pairs, there are a total of 
8+8+25 = 41 interconnect pads required. To implement a 
300 nozzle printhead, it is necessary to increase the 
number of groups to 12 resulting in 12+12+25 = 49 
interconnect pads to the printhead. FIG. 1 is an 
illustrative schematic diagram of a conventional two 
dimensional address control for a 300 nozzle integrated 
printhead having 12 primitive selects x 25 address 
selects. The grounds are not used for addressing and are 
always tied to a common ground. To turn on a
