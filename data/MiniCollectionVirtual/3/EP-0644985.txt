Pneumatic jack of the type having a rigid jack body (1) 
joined to the outer edge of a deformable membrane (2) so as to 

delimit together with the latter a chamber of variable volume 
designed to be subjected either to atmospheric pressure or a 

negative pressure by means of an air inlet provided in the 
said chamber, characterised in that the body (1) and the 

membrane (2) each have, substantially centrally, a 
substantially similar aperture (15, 14) capable of being 

closed at least partially respectively by an obturator (4, 3) 
of identical contour but of slightly larger size than the 

aperture. 
Jack according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said 
body (1) takes the form of a bowl whose peripheral rim (17) 

serves to hold the membrane (2) in place and whose face 
forming a base (16) has a substantially central aperture (15) 

closed at least partially by the obturator (3). 
Jack according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
membrane (2) takes a general bowl shape whose face forming a 

base (19) is provided with a substantially central aperture 
(14) closed at least partially by the obturator (4) joined to 

the periphery of the aperture (14), the obturator (4) 
cooperating with the membrane (2) so as to come to bear 

against the base (19) of the bowl when the chamber is 
subjected to a negative pressure. 
Jack according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
obturator (4) joined to the membrane (2) has a jack rod (5) 

which directly transmits the movement of the membrane (2) to 
the element to be actuated. 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that it has several contiguous chambers obtained by assembling  

 
modules each having at least one body (1) and a membrane (2), 

the connection between two adjacent modules being effected by 
one and the same obturator (3, 4) closing at least partially 

at the same time the body of one module and the membrane of 
the adjacent module, and keeping the membrane (2) joined to 

the body (1). 
Jack according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
modules are assembled by means of hollow and/or solid 

obturators (3, 4) so as to obtain modules connected in series 
and/or in parallel. 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the air inlet of a chamber is provided in the rigid body 

(1) of the jack and preferably consists of a nozzle (10) 
capable of being connected by means of a pipe to a source of 

negative pressure. 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the air inlet of the chamber consists of the aperture 

(15) provided at the base of the said body (1) and is at least 
partially closed by the obturator (3), the said aperture being 

capable of being connected by means of a joining piece and 
optionally by a pipe to a source of negative pressure. 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that it has means (13) of bracing the chamber of the jack 

connecting the obturator (4) closing the membrane (2) with the 
rigid body (1) of the jack, the said means being pivotally 

and/or slidably mounted on the obturator (4) closing the 
membrane (2) and slidably and/or pivotally on the base (16) of 

the body (1) and optionally on the obturator (3) at least 
partially closing the base of the body (1) so as to retract 

when the chamber is subjected to negative pressure and, on the 
other hand, to limit the travel of the obturator (4) closing 

the membrane (2) when the said chamber is subjected to 
atmospheric pressure.  

 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that the rigid jack bod
y (1) is held joined at its periphery 
to the outer edge of the deformable membrane by means of a 

ring (6) which grips the membrane (2) and the plate against 
the projecting peripheral rim (17) of the jack body (1). 
Jack according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that the jack body (1) is held joined at its periphery to the 

outer edge of the deformable membrane (2) by means of a second 
body (7) disposed symmetrically in relation to the first body 

(1), the outer edge of the membrane (2) being disposed in the 
joint plane of the said bodies (1, 7). 
Jack according to Claim 11, characterised in that this 
second body (7) forming the front face of the jack is fitted 

with an obturator (8) having an aperture allowing the passage 
of the jack rod (5). 
Jack according to Claim 12, characterised in that the 
seal between this aperture for passage of the jack rod and the 

rod (5) is provided by means of a second membrane (9).
