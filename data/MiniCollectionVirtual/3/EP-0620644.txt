<ABSTRACT>
The turn-off delay time of a low-side driver (output 
power transistor), may be independently reduced and 

eventually made identical to the turn-on delay time by 
employing an auxiliary current generator that may be 

controlled by the same switching signal that controls a 
current generator employed for discharging the control 

node of the low-side driver, in order to provide an 
augmented discharging current during a first phase of a 

turn-off process. The contribution to the capacitance 
discharge current provided by said third current 

generator is automatically interrupted by means 
responsive to the voltage present on the driving node 

of the low-side driver, when it approaches saturation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control
circuit for an output power transistor (low-side
driver) having means for reducing and
controlling switching delays and which permits
to make substantially identical the turn-off
and the turn-on delays of the output signal.Many power ICs are required to drive external
loads connected to a supply line (low-side driver).
The power switch that is commonly employed in
these ICs, whenever the fabrication technology
will permit it, is an integrated DMOS transistor,
because it offers numerous advantages as compared
with a bipolar transistor of similar power
rating.By driving the gate of the DMOS, its drain
voltage, i.e. the voltage (signal) on the output
node of the low-side driver stage, varies
between Vds=Rdson*Id and Vds=H.V., wherein Id is
the current flowing through the power transistor
and H.V. is the supply voltage of the external
load.In order to minimize the power dissipated
through the power transistor when it is conducting,
it is necessary to minimize its Rdson.
This is obtained by imposing to the gate a
voltage higher than the grounded source potential
of the power transistor by a well defined
quantity, equal to about 10V (overdrive voltage).
Most often in practice, the supply voltage Vcc
of the integrated circuit is applied to the
gate of the output power transistor during a
conduction phase.The document JP-A-1183214 discloses a control circuit for an output
power transistor including a first controlled current generator for charging
a control node of the power transistor and second and third current
generators for discharging the driving node capacitance of the power
transistor, whereby the third current generator helps in discharging the
driving node capacitance until the power transistor reaches a near
saturation condition.A control circuit that is normally used for driving  
an output power DMOS transistor is schematically
depicted in Fig. 1.The current generators I1 and I2, driven by the
switching signals S1 and S2 in phase opposition to each
other, have the function of charging and discharging,
respectively, the capacitance of the driving node
(gate) of the power DMOS. Fig. 2 shows the time-diagram
of the gate and drain voltages of the power transistor
during a turn-on phase and during a turn-off phase.
Three distinct operating regions of the characteristics
may be observed in both phases. During a turn-on, in a
first zone I of the characteristic, the gate voltage
rises from Vgs=0V to Vgs=Vth. In this region of the
characteristic, there isn't any
