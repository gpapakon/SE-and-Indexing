<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyolefin composition, and 
more specifically to a polyolefin composition comprising (A) 
an irradiated, normally solid, high molecular weight, 
amorphous to predominantly crystalline olefin polymer material 
and (B) a non-irradiated propylene polymer material or a 
mixture thereof with an olefin copolymer rubber. Olefin polymer materials, in particular propylene polymer 
materials, have been widely used in various applications, such 
as fibers, films, sheets and other shaped articles, because of 
their excellent physical and mechanical properties. However, 
some of the olefin polymer materials have been found 
undesirable for applications requiring low gloss, such as 
thermoforming, extrusion coating, blow molding, injection 
molding and sheet or film extrusion, because of their high 
gloss after processing. The high gloss of these processed 
parts interferes with applications, such as painting, over 
said parts. Thus, there is a need in the industry for olefin polymer 
materials having low gloss after processing, and which 
substantially retain their physical and mechanical properties. It has been found that by blending an irradiated, 
normally solid, high molecular weight, amorphous to 
predominantly crystalline olefin polymer material with a non-irradiated 
propylene polymer or a mixture thereof with an 
olefin copolymer rubber, a composition is obtained having 
reduced gloss, improved thermoformability, calendering and 
blow molding properties. Accordingly, there is provided a polyolefin composition 
consisting essentially of (A) from 5 to 95% by weight of an 
irradiated, normally solid, high molecular weight, amorphous  
 
to predominantly crystalline olefin polymer material, the 
molecular chains of which have a substantial amount of free-end 
long branches, a branching index of less than 1 and has 
significant strain hardening elongation viscosity, and (B) 
from 95 to 5% by weight of a non-irradiated propylene polymer 
material or a mixture thereof with an olefin copolymer rubber. All parts and percentages used in this application are by 
weight unless otherwise specified. Ambient or room 
temperature is approximately 25Â°C. Component (A), an irradiated, normally solid, high 
molecular weight, amorphous to predominantly crystalline 
olefin polymer material used in the composition of the present 
invention is selected from the group consisting of: 
(1) a homopolymer of propylene; (2) an ethylene polymer material selected from the group 
consisting essentially of: 
(i)
