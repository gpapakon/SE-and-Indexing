<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the production or treatment of semiconductor or other solid components, especially to a method for directly nano-structuring amorphous carbonlayers. According to the invention, a local, field-induced reaction is activated in the carbon with an electrically conductive or semiconducting probe. Said probe is positioned at a distance from the amorphous carbon layer or is passed over said amorphous carbon layer at a distance. The distance must be such that the electrical conduction mechanism 'field emission' or 'tunnelling' can still occur. An electrical voltage is applied to said probe in relation to the layer at the points where recesses are to be made in the layer or the layer is to be removed. This process alone produces the desired structure without any further technical steps. The inventive method can be used advantageously in the production of electronic components in the sub- mu m and nm areas, and is particularly suitable in those fields for producing nano-structured etching masks whose structures have to be transferred onto layers placed beneath them. The method can also be used advantageously for entering information into amorphous carbon layers for information storage.

Process for nanostructuring amorphous carbon layers, 
characterized in that
 an electrically conductive or semiconducting probe, which is located above or guided over the amorphous carbon layer at a distance within which the electrical conduction mechanism of field emission or tunnelling is possible, and to which an electric voltage is applied with respect to the layer, is used to activate a local, field-induced reaction of the carbon at the locations at which recesses are to be introduced into the layer or the layer is to be removed, the reaction products being volatile.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the electrically conductive or semiconducting probe is located above or guided over the amorphous carbon layer at a distance of up to 10 nm.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a negative DC voltage potential with a minimum voltage in the range from 3 to 8 volts with respect to the layer or an AC voltage is applied to the probe.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the distance between the electrically
 conductive or semiconducting probe and the amorphous carbon layer is defined by an electrically insulating layer with a layer thickness of up to a few nanometres, which is located on the surface of the probe.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the reaction is carried out in an oxygen environment, with oxides of carbon being produced as reaction products.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the reaction is carried out in a hydrogen or nitrogen environment.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the nanostructuring is carried out by means of a scanning probe microscope, with the electrically conductive or semiconducting probe of the microscope being used for the field-induced reaction of the carbon.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the electrically conductive probe used is a structured electrode, the structure of which is designed as the negative of the nanostructure which is to be produced in the layer.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the distance between the electrically conductive or semiconducting probe and the amorphous carbon layer is altered periodically at times during the structuring.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the negative DC voltage potential is altered periodically at times during the structuring.
Process according to Claims 1 and 3, 
characterized in that
 an electrically conductive or semiconducting probe made from silicon is used, and 
in that
 the polarity of the DC voltage potential is reversed for a certain time at certain intervals during the structuring, with the result that a layer of silicon oxide is formed or restored on the surface of the probe as a result of field-induced oxidation.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a constant current source is used instead of a DC voltage source, in which case the contact resistance between electrically conductive or semiconducting probe and the amorphous carbon layer is to be set in such a way that a certain minimum voltage is reached during the structuring.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 the process is used to produce structures which represent digital or analogue information items for the purpose of storing information items of this type in amorphous carbon layers.
