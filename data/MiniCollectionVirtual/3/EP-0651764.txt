<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of a previously filed copending 
US application Serial No. 07/915,923 filed July 17, 1992. The present invention relates to methods for inhibiting the 
bio-activity of enzymes. More specifically, the invention comprises 
molecules having cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen properties, and 
methods of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of cysteine protease 
using such molecules. Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-2 (abbreviated CTLA-2) is a 
molecule expressed by activated T-cells and mast cells. 
Complementary DNA (cDNA) for two distinct but homologous forms 
of CTLA-2 are known, namely CTLA-2α and CTLA-2β (Denizot et al., 
1989, Eur. J. Immunol., 19:631-635). The present specification describes the identification of the 
gene encoding for peptides with CTLA-2 activity, and the expression, 
purification and characterization of such peptides having CTLA-2 
activity. The identified gene for CTLA-2β codes for a protein 
consisting of 138 amino acids (15,900 g/mole) including a putative 
leader sequence. Removal of the hydrophobic N-terminus results in 
a protein of 110 amino acids (12,800 g/mole). There are a total of 
five cysteine residues in the molecule, two of which are in the 
putative leader sequence. Therefore, the mature protein should 
contain three cysteine residues indicating the formation of disulfide 
linked dimers. The CTLA-2α gene codes for a protein which is 98% 
homologous (90% identical) to CTLA-2β at the protein level. CTLA-2α 
has a total of three cysteines in the full-length protein but only one 
in the mature form. Therefore, CTLA-2α also has the potential of 
forming a disulfide linked dimer. The presently disclosed invention includes methods for 
inhibiting certain cysteine proteases with molecules having CTLA-2α 
and CTLA-2β activity. Members of the cysteine protease family all 
have cysteine in their active sites, and the family includes the 
enzyme papain found in the papaya plant, a developmentally 
regulated proteinase in the Dictyostelium slime mold, Chinese  
 
goosberry actinidin, and the mammalian lysosomal Cathepsins B, H, 
and L (Portnoy et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem., 261:14697). Cathepsins are proteolytic enzymes found in most mammalian 
cells and their functions include cellular autolysis and tissue 
degredation (Bohley et al., 1992, Experimentia, 48:151; Funabiki et 
al., 1990, Int. J. Biochem. 22:1303). Cathepsin L is a major lysosomal 
protease and is responsible for bulk turnover of intracellular 
protein. The cDNA sequence for CTLA-2β is
