<ABSTRACT>
A device for inserting and extracting a data carrier 
(2) into/from a reader. The device includes a data 

carrier holder (3) pivotally connected to a deck (1) of 
the reader, a locking member (5) slidably installed on the 

carrier holder (3) for performing a locking/release 
function, a locking release member (10) one end of which 

is rotatably installed on the deck (1), the release member 
(10) having a center of rotation above that of the carrier 

holder, so that its other end is lockably engageable with 
the carrier holder (3) to release a locking state of the 

locking member (5), and an extraction member (12) for 
enabling extraction/insertion of the data carrier (2). 

The extraction member (12) is pivotally connected to the 
carrier holder (3) and has a first end lockable by the 

locking member (5), a portion for raising the locking 
release member (10), and a second end for extracting an 

inserted data carrier (2) when released by the locking 
release member (10). The device has a simplified 

structure, and enables insertion/extraction of data 
carriers (2) such as disk cartridges solely by the 

engagement of the various members and without the need of 
a motorised loading mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for extracting an
inserted data carrier from a reader and particularly, but
not exclusively, to a device for extracting an inserted
disk cartridge for a recording/playback disk player.The development of magnetooptical disk cartridges of
a 64mm diameter (commercially referred to as "minidisks")
has been under way since the minidisk was first introduced.A portable player for recording and
playback operations with the minidisk, is on the market.
This player has a slot into which a minidisk is
insertable. A minidisk cartridge is loaded into the deck
by the driving force of a motor, with a shutter of the
cartridge being moved aside to open a communicating
aperture. The cartridge is thereafter mounted on a
turntable and rotated by a spindle motor during
playback/recording operations.Furthermore, reference is made to
EP-A-0 437091 disclosing a disc player with a disc extracting device
having the precharacterising features of appended claim 1.In general, it is desirable that a portable player
should be as light and small as possible, allow the rapid
insertion/extraction of a disk cartridge, and have a very
low power consumption. However, due to the specific 
construction of the insertion means, i.e., via a slot, the
Sony minidisk player has a complicated structure for
insertion/extraction of cartridges. Furthermore, due to
limitations which are imposed on the player by providing
it with a motorized loading mechanism, it is difficult to
miniaturize and reduce the weight of the player and to
speed up the inserting and extracting operations thereof.
A further disadvantage is that utilising a motorized
loading mechanism to insert and/or extract the minidisk
increases the player's overall power consumption.
Accordingly, battery power cannot be efficiently utilized.Therefore, it is an aim of preferred embodiments of
the invention to provide a device for inserting and
extracting a disk cartridge for a disk player in which
insertion and extraction of the disk cartridge are
performed by the engagement of meters without the use of
a motor, so as to reduce the number of device components
and, by removing the need for a motor to load disks,
achieve a means of rapid insertion/extraction of the disk
cartridge, a reduction in power consumption, and lower
production costs.According to the present invention,
there is provided a device for extracting an inserted data
carrier from a reader, the device comprising: 
a data carrier holder, one end of which is pivotally
connected to a deck of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for extracting an inserted data carrier (2)
from a reader, the device comprising:


a data carrier holder (3), one end of which is
pivotally connected to a deck (1) of the reader via a

first pivotal attachment having an associated first

pivotal axis;
locking means (5) associated with the carrier holder
(3) for performing a locking/release function;
locking release means (10) having first and second
ends, the first end being pivotally connected to the deck

(1) by a second pivotal attachment, wherein said second
pivotal attachment has a second pivotal axis which is

displaced from said first pivotal axis such that the
second end is capable of interlocking engagement with the

carrier holder (3) to perform said release function; and
extraction means (12) pivotally connected to the
carrier holder, the extraction means (12) being lockable

by said locking means (5)
characterised in that the extraction means consists of
a single extraction member (12) which has a first end which directly 

engages with said locking means (5) and a second end (16)
which is adapted to extract an inserted data carrier (2)

from the reader when released by said locking means (5).
A device according to claim 1, wherein said locking
means (5) comprises:


a stop (6) for blocking one end of said extraction
means;
a locking member having a locking release piece (52)
for releasing the device from the locked state, the

release piece (52) being provided between said first end
(14) of the extraction means (12) and said stop (6) when

the device is in said locked stated; and
a first spring (7) installed between said locking
member and said carrier holder (3) for resiliently biasing

said locking member (5) towards an insertion direction of
the data carrier (2).
A device as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein said locking release means (10) comprises:


a locking release member one end of which is
pivotally connected to said deck; and 
a second spring (11) provided between said locking
release member (10) and said carrier holder (3) or deck

(1), and for resiliently biasing said locking release
member (10) towards said holder (13).
A device as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
wherein said extraction means (12) comprises:


an extraction member (12) resiliently biased towards
an extraction direction of said carrier (2) by a third

spring (13) connected to said carrier holder (3);
a projection (14) formed on one end of said
extraction member (12) and lockably engageable with said

locking means (5);
a raised portion (15) formed on said extraction
member (12) for enabling said locking release means (10)

to be raised when said extraction member (12) is to be
released; and
an extracting piece (16) formed on the other end of
said extraction member (12) and bent towards an interior

region (31) of said carrier holder (3) for engagement with
said data carrier (2) during an extraction operation.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim:

   wherein, the locking release means (10) is adapted to
automatically release said locking means (5) when said

data carrier holder (3) is moved to a data carrier
insertion/ extraction position and to automatically lock

said locking means (5) into a locked position following
the insertion of a data carrier (2) into the data carrier

holder (3) and subsequent movement of the data carrier
holder (3) from the insertion/extraction position towards

a reading position.
