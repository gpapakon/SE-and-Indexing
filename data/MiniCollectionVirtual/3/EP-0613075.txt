<ABSTRACT>
A distributed clock generation scheme is provided 
for a microprocessor that reduces electromagnetic 

interference and power consumption. Rather than using a 
single, large internal clock generator circuit that 

meets the drive requirements of the remaining circuitry 
upon the microprocessor die, a plurality of smaller 

clock generator circuits are distributed across the die, 
each generating clock signals to drive a separate 

portion of the microprocessor circuitry. Each of the 
distributed clock generator circuits may be load matched 

with respect to the others to minimize the skew between 
clock signals, and each receives a synchronized timing 

signal provided from a master timing distribution 
circuit. As a result of the distributed clock 

generation scheme, the amount of current and the rate at 
which current is sourced or sunk at a given location on 

the semiconductor die is reduced, thereby reducing 
electromagnetic interference and increasing the signal 

to noise ratio. In addition, the loading upon the 
distributed clock generators due to the internal routing 

of the clock signals is decreased, also reducing 
electromagnetic interference and power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microprocessor circuitry and, more 
particularly, to the generation of internal microprocessor clock 
signals. US-A-5,140,184 discloses a circuit having four distributed clock 
circuits providing clock signals to four corresponding circuit areas. 
The four distributed clock generator circuits receive a master timing 
signal derived from an external clock signal. US-A-5,153,450 discloses a variable strength output driver 
circuit in which two driver circuits are coupled in parallel. Microprocessor circuits require clock signals to 
provide timing references for controlling activities 
within the microprocessor. A microprocessor typically 
receives an external clock signal generated by a crystal 
oscillator or other external clock source and, using 
this external clock signal, generates an internal clock 
signal having a high degree of stability with a fifty-percent 
duty cycle. The internally generated clock 
signal may have the same frequency as that of the 
external clock signal or may have a frequency that is a 
fraction or a multiple of the external clock signal 
frequency. CMOS integrated circuit microprocessors, for proper 
operation thereof, generally must be clocked by an 
internal clock signal having a first phase and a second 
phase for each clock cycle period. The clock signal 
first phase is at a high level for a first execution 
time period and the second phase is at a low level for a 
second execution time period to complete each clock 
cycle. The reason for this clocking procedure is that 
CMOS integrated circuits include circuitry wherein a 
first portion of the circuitry is active during the high 
level first phase of the clock signal and the other 
portion of the circuitry is active during the low level 
second phase of the clock signal. For this reason, the  
 
microprocessor typically generates a pair of internal 
clock signals that are 180 degrees out of phase, one 
being provided to the first portion of the circuitry and 
the second being provided to the other portion of the 
circuitry. The first and second phases of each clock signal 
cycle must be of sufficient duration to enable both 
portions of the microprocessor circuitry to complete 
their execution. Each such portion requires some finite 
minimum execution time because of internal 
microprocessor delays resulting from internal speed 
paths. To ensure that the minimum execution times are 
met for both portions of the microprocessor circuitry 
while maximizing the frequency of the internal clock 
signa
