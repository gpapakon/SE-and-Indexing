<ABSTRACT>
In order to transmit information between a sending station (STA) and a receiving station (STB) separated by a distance exceeding the direct communication range of the said stations, the method according to the invention consists in equipping aircraft (A1 to A25) which circulate in the space lying between these two stations, with open communications relay systems, of limited range, capable of being momentarily interconnected when they are within range of one another, in order to cause the information to transmit from relay system to relay system, up to its destination. The invention applies particularly to air-ground communications for data exchange in the field of air transport.

A method for transmitting information between an emitting station
(STA) and a receiving station (STB) separated by a distance exceeding the

range of direct communications of said stations,

characterized in that said method consists in equipping the airplanes (A
1
 -
A
25
) flying in the airspace within their normal activities and travelling in an
almost random manner in relation to one another, with open

communications relay systems of limited range which can momentarily
interconnect, when within range of one another, in order to pass

information from relay system to relay system up to its destination, said
relay systems constituting transmission nodes of which the configuration

varies constantly.
The method as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that said information is transmitted by HF or VHF type
radio.
The method as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that said information is in the form of data packets each
containing destination equipment identification data and routing

information.
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that each relay system comprises a routing data base (7)
susceptible of receiving routing information (4) from neighboring relay

systems within its range, and of elaborating routing information with a view
to transmission thereof to said neighboring relay systems, a relaying

means susceptible of receiving (2) the data packets transmitted by said
neighboring relay systems and which, with a view to transmission (1)

thereof to one of said neighboring systems, associates, with these data
packets, routing information determined as a function of the routing data

initially contained in said packets and routing information elaborated by
said base (7).
The method as claimed in claim 4,

characterized in that the routing information assigned to a data packet by a
relay system is determined by implementation of a path selection algorithm

(8) enabling a choice to be made between the different possible routes and
enabling determination of the route deemed the best. 
The method as claimed in claim 5,

characterized in that the path selection algorithm (8) is applied in an
identical manner by all the relay systems situated within the routing range.
The method as claimed in one of claims 5 and 6,

characterized in that the path selection algorithm (8) computes the
weighted sum of the values of the attributes selected and the route

selected is the one whose sum has the highest value.
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that, with a view to setting up a connection between two
relay systems, said two relay systems transmit messages containing

addressing data of their own system, and in that said connection is only set
up when each relay system has received an acknowledgement of its

message, addressed by the other relay system, the two relays in
possession of their respective addresses being then able to communicate

with one another.
The method as claimed in claim 8,

characterized in that, once the connection has been set up between said
two relay systems, each relay system can transfer information by using the

address it received from said other relay system, said transfer being
susceptible of comprising information concerning said routing data base (7)

or routing scopes accessible by each of said two relay systems.
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that said relaying means of a first relay system assigns to
said data packets to be transmitted to a second relay system the address

they received from said second relay system at the time said connection
was set up between said two relay systems.
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that each relay system saves the information concerning
the neighboring relay systems prior to setting up a connection with another

relay system, and in that, once this saving has been performed, said relay
can transmit a request to have a channel opened until it receives, from a

corresponding relay, an acknowledgement of its own request, and in that,
for a data packet to be transmitted, each relay system must have

previously informed the other as to the destinations contained within its
scope of routing. 
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that each time a connection has been set up between two
relay systems, each relay system must update its data base (7) defining

the rules enabling the determining of routes to destinations contained
within its scope of routing.
