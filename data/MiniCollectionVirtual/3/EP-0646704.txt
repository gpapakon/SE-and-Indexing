<ABSTRACT>
In a method for controlling a gas turbine plant essentially comprising a compressor unit (1), a high-pressure combustion chamber (4), a high-pressure turbine (6), a low-pressure combustion chamber (9), a low-pressure turbine (12) and a generator (14), the quantity of fuel (FH) for the high-pressure combustion chamber (4) is adjusted by a corrected temperature signal composed of the value of the temperature (T13) at the outlet of the low-pressure turbine (12) reduced by the respective temperature rise ( DELTA T) detectable there. This temperature signal (T13- DELTA T) is recorded by subtracting the temperature rise ( DELTA T) produced by the quantity of fuel (FL) introduced into the low-pressure combustion chamber (9) from the temperature measured at the outlet of the low-pressure turbine (12). For the quantity of fuel (FL) for the low-pressure combustion chamber (9), the uncorrected temperature signal at the outlet of the low-pressure turbine (12) is used.

Method for regulating a gas-turbine assembly, 
essentially consisting of a compressor unit (1), of a 

first combustion chamber (4) downstream of the 
compressor unit, of a first turbine (6) downstream of 

the first combustion chamber, of a second combustion 
chamber (1) which is downstream of this first turbine 

and operates by auto-ignition and the hot gases of 
which load a second turbine (12), and of at least one 

generator (14), characterized in that the rating of the 
fuel quantity (FH) for the first combustion chamber (4) 

is carried out by means of a corrected temperature 
signal (T13 - ΔT) which is recorded in that the 

temperature rise (ΔT) generated by the fuel quantity 
(FL) introduced into the second combustion chamber (9) 

is subtracted from the measured temperature (T13) at 
the outlet of the second turbine (12), and in that the 

uncorrected temperature signal at the outlet of the 
second turbine (12) is used for rating the fuel 

quantity (FL) for the second combustion chamber (9). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the temperature rise (ΔT) in relation to the fuel 

quantity (FH) for the first combustion chamber (4) is 
governed by a variable function.
