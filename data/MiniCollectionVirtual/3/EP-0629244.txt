<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to biocatalysts that are specifically targeted to bind pathogens, such as viruses, and to degrade components of pathogens in order to abrogate their pathogenicity, and to methods of preventing or treating infection by pathogenic organisms. The biocatalysts comprise a binding agent which specifically binds a surface component of a pathogen, for instance the gp120 viral coat protein of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and a catalytic moiety which degrades a component of the pathogen so that its pathogenicity is abrogated. The binding agent and the catalytic moiety are linked by chemical linkers or genetic engineering techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pathogenic organisms, including viruses, may be 
divided into different classes on the basis of their 
fate after being phagocytized. For instance, 
organisms that are promptly destroyed when 
phagocytized (i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) behave 
as extracellular parasites, damaging tissues only so 
long as they remain outside phagocytic cells. Pathogens that function as extracellular 
parasites owe their virulence to antiphagocytic 
surface components. Most pathogenic bacteria for 
example, maintain capsules comprising 
high-molecular-weight polysaccharides. The relation 
between capsules, phagocytosis and virulence is 
clearly exemplified by S. pneumoniae. A fully 
encapsulated S (smooth) strain is found to resist 
phagocytosis (in the absence of antibodies) and is 
highly virulent for mice, whereas its nonencapsulated 
R (rough) mutant is readily phagocytized and is 
essentially avirulent. However, enzymatic removal of 
the capsular polysaccharide, or combination with 
antibody, renders the S organisms both nonpathogenic 
and susceptible to phagocytosis. In contrast to extracellular parasites, there are 
two classes of intracellular parasites, both of which 
can multiply within phagocytic cells. One class of 
these intracellular pathogens comprise the obligate 
intracellular parasites (i.e., rickettsiae, 
chlamydiae). For these organisms, which include 
viruses, subtle differences in the cell surface 
receptors essential for their uptake may be important  
 
in resistance. Many pathogens, whether intracellular or 
extracellular, are organotropic. That is, they are 
highly selective in regard to the tissue or cell-type 
that they infect or invade. One determinant of tissue 
tropism is the presence of surface macromolecules on 
the pathogen that promote adherence to specific 
receptors on one host cell-type but not on others. 
For instance, the role of specific bacterial adherence 
is now increasingly recognized in the selective 
colonization of host tissue or cell-types. For many 
obligate intracellular parasites, the molecules 
responsible for organotropic adherence are also 
crucial to the internalization of the pathogen. Blocking this cell-specific interaction aids in 
the destruction of pathogenicity. For instance, 
antibodies to pathogen surface constituents promote 
immunity not only by opsonization but also by covering 
antigens involved in adherence. Moreover, in body 
secretions, secreted glycoproteins closely related to 
cell surface components may play a role in host 
defense by competing
