<ABSTRACT>
A point to point connection architecture for a computer I/O subsystem, resulting in a scalable tree structure. A Master I/O Concentrator (MIOC) is connected to the host bus and handles conversion between a bus oriented structure and the tree structure of the I/O subsystem. Ports away from the host bus are downstream ports and conform to a simple byt wide message protocol. Various IOCs and devices can be attached to one of the downstream ports on the MIOC. The MIOC directs transmissions to the appropriate channel based on a geographical addressing scheme. The IOC connections act as further points of branching. Ultimately IOD or I/O devices are reached, having an upstream port for connection to the IOC and a downstream port and internal logic appropriate for the particular peripheral device. Various registers are present in the IOCs and the IODs to allow determination of the topology and particular devices present. Messages and commands are transfered in the I/O subsystem in defined packets. Various read, write and exchange commands are used, with a read response being utilized to allow split transaction read operations. Certain status and control commands are also present. Interrupts are handled by having the interrupt levels correspond to memory addresses of the programmable interrupt controller, thus allowing simple selection of interrupts to be generated by the devices and no need for separate wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SCALABLE TREE STRUCTURED HIGH SPEED I/O SUBSYSTEM ARCHITECTUREThe invention relates to computer system architectures, and more specifically to an architecture having input/output devices arrayed in a tree configuration from a main bus, with data transfer being done with command and data packets.Personal computers have been developing very rapidly. Initial designs had relatively low performance microprocessors, with relatively low performance input/output (I/O) and peripheral devices. Therefore a simple conventional bus architecture was quite adequate. However, performance of some of the components began increasing at a very high rate. Soon the simple bus architectures, particularly those with separate I/O spaces became a limiting factor. The bus speeds were simply too slow for adequate peripheral and I/O throughput. Several variations were tried to improve the capabilities of the bus, mainly increasing the data path widths and transfer cycle speeds, but the bus architecture was still a limiting factor. Because interchangeable circuit boards were desired, widths were limited, as were speeds. Additionally, device loadings and capacitances became a problem, so that fewer slots were available at the highest of speeds. And yet the microprocessors continued to increase in performance, as did peripheral performance as increased use was made of local processors to allow parallel operation. But still the bus speed limitations remained. Variations were suggested that required removal of the card slots, but this solution provided only a short term solution, with the next generation of microprocessors again due to out strip this more integrated solution. Thus, while computer system performance was increasing, the effective rate of increase was significantly less than the basic processor' performance improvement, system 

flexibility was being reduced and costs and complexities were being increased.Further, the use of buses limited the number of available slots and layout of any slots. The number of slots available internally on a bus was practically limited to about eight due to electrical loading limitations. External expansion slots were not usually viable for high speed operations because of timing problems induced in the connection cabling. And the buses limited the layout alternatives of the slots. To be at all efficient of circuit board space the bus conductors had to run parallel, with the slots thus also being parallel, forming a rectangular box which had to be reserved for expansion cards.
