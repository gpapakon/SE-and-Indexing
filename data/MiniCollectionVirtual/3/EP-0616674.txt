<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for achieving an optimal energy exchange in regenerative heat exchange between the combustion air and in a cooling device (15) precooled, wet flue gases. By letting the moisture in said flue gases being condensed on the heat transfer surfaces the moisture will be transferred over to the air side where it is vaporized, resulting in some advantages, e.g. an increased energy exchange. According to the invention it has turned out to be possible to achieve a further increase of the energy exchange in a simple way by ensuring that the heat transfer surfaces of the flue gas side become really water-soaked when on the flue gas side, e.g. by letting the condensed water from the precooling device (15) drip or flow down onto the heat transfert surfaces such that said surfaces will remain wet during the entire passage through the combustion air side (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for achieving an optimal energy exchange in 
regenerative heat exchange between the combustion air and in a cooling device precooled, 
wet flue gases. Such a method is known from US-A-4 287 938. When flue gases containing water vapour are cooled down to temperatures under their dew 
point the water vapour can condense and the condensation heat be recovered. A further drop 
in temperature is possible by a regenerative heat exchange between the combustion air and 
the precooled, wet flue gases, further water vapour being condensed on the fume side and 
again being vaporized on the combustion air side. As the combustion air simultaneously with 
being heated is wetted an essential part of the energy can be transferred from the flue gases to 
the combustion air. The transferable energy amount, however, is limited by the fume side 
condensation being achieved during the regenerative heat exchange which is not sufficiently 
corresponding to the combustion air side vaporization capability. The invention has as an object in a simple way to achieve an optimal energy exchange for the 
method mentioned in the beginning. This object is according to the invention achieved by that the surfaces of a regenerative heat 
exchanger's heat exchanging elements on the fume side are sprinkled with water in such a 
way that a water layer is formed on the heat exchanger element surfaces in such a degree that 
the element surfaces during their whole stay on the air side are substantially 100 per cent 
covered with water. Without this water being added the heat transfer element surfaces dry up 
when passing the air side. The content of this procedure in comparison with the method 
according to the invention appears from the following description of an example, according to 
which by the method of the invention an increase of energy in the combustion air is achieved 
with 12,6 per cent. According to a simple especially preferred development of the invention the cooling device 
for the flue gas precooling is placed on top of the heat exchanger flue gas side, where the flue 
gases are led down into the heat exchanger in such a way that the condensation water formed 
in the cooling device can flow and/or drip down onto the heat exchanger elements It is then  
 
easily achieved a temperature of the supplied water being substantially equal to or somewhat 
higher than the flue gas temperature at the heat exchanger inlet, which is of importance for 
the heat exchange. The invention will be
