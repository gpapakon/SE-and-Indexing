<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a latent 
electrostatic image developing device for use in 
developing a latent electrostatic image to a toner 
image in image forming apparatuses such as 
electrostatic copying machines and electrostatic 
printing machines. More specifically, it relates to 
a latent electrostatic image developing device of the 
type using a developer comprising a toner and carrier 
particles. As is well known, a latent electrostatic 
image developing device of the type using a developer 
comprising a toner and carrier particles is widely 
used to develop a latent electrostatic image in image 
forming apparatuses. This latent electrostatic image 
developing device has a development housing for 
accommodating a developer, a developer applicator 
means for applying the developer in the development 
housing to a latent electrostatic image, a developer 
agitating/conveying means for agitating the developer 
in the development housing and conveying it in a 
desired direction, and a toner feed means for 
supplying a toner into the development housing. The 
developer applicator means usually includes a 
rotating sleeve member, on whose peripheral surface 
the developer is held to be conveyed to a developing 
zone. In the developing zone, a toner in the 
developer is selectively adhered to a latent 
electrostatic image, whereby the latent image is 
developed to a toner image. When the toner in the 
developer has been consumed with the development of 
the latent electrostatic image, a toner is supplied  
 
by the toner feed means into the development housing. 
The developer agitating/conveying means agitates the 
developer within the development housing to mix and 
frictionally charge the toner and the carrier 
particles, while conveying the developer in a 
predetermined direction. In the above-mentioned type of latent 
electrostatic image developing device, it is 
important that the developer be agitated sufficiently 
satisfactorily before being held on the developer 
applicator means and conveyed to the developing zone, 
and that the developer having the toner and the 
carrier particles mixed sufficiently uniformly in a 
proportion within a predetermined range be applied to 
the latent electrostatic image. It is also important 
that in the downstream side of the developing zone, 
the developer having the toner of the reduced 
proportion as a result of the adhesion of the toner 
to the latent electrostatic image be effectively 
released from the developer applicator means so as to 
be agitated and
