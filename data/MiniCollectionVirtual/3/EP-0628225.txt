Induction module for an asynchronous linear electric 
motor comprising an outer protective shell (7) of parallelepipedic 

shape constituted by a rectangular horizontal 
bottom (4), two opposite vertical and longitudinal walls 

(5) and two opposite vertical and transverse walls (6), 
a laminated magnetic circuit constituted by a bar (8), 

generally of parallelepipedic shape, of shorter length 
and of smaller width than the inner length and width 

of the protective shell (7), extending along the longitudinal 
axis (xy) of the outer protective shell (7), this 

bar (8) presenting in its upper part a succession of 
transverse recesses (9) regularly spaced apart from one 

another in the longitudinal direction, opening in the 
upper face (8b) and in the two vertical and longitudinal 

faces of the bar (8), defining therebetween projections 
(11) constituting polar pieces, field coils (13, 14, 

16, 17, 18) housed in the recesses (9) of the magnetic 
bar (8), and an insulating material (15) filling the 

space left free inside the protective shell (7) between 
the latter and the magnetic bar (8) and the coils that 

it bears, characterized in that the height of the magnetic 
bar (8) is greater than the height of the longitudinal 

(5) and transverse (6) walls of the protective shell 
(7), so that, after the insulating material (15) has 

been cast, the planar polar faces (8b) of the projections 
(11) of the magnetic bar emerge from the block of solidified 

insulating material (15). 
Induction module according to Claim 1, in which 
the field coils (13, 14, 16, 17, 18) are respectively 

disposed in different horizontal planes, characterized 
in that the field coil (13) located in an upper plane 

comprises a number of turns greater than that of the 
coil (14) located in the lower plane.
