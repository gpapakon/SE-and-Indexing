<ABSTRACT>
An ice layer (26) of an etchant is formed on the 
upper surface of a surface table (25) by a cooling mechanism 

(25b), and is kept at a temperature near the 
freezing point of the etchant. Thereafter, a semiconductor 

substrate (20) having an insulating layer 
formed on one surface thereof is fixed on the lower surface 

of a chuck mechanism (24) such that the other surface 
of the substrate (20) is in contact with the lower 

surface. The insulating layer is pressed against the 
ice layer (26) with a predetermined load. Then, the 

chuck mechanism (24) is rotated by a second motor in a 
first direction (27), together with a second shaft 

(24a), while the surface table (25) is rotated by a 
first motor in a second direction (28), together with a 

first shaft (25a). At the same time, the chuck mechanism 
(24) is slid on the surface table (25), thereby 

selectively etching the insulating layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a method 
for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which are 
used, in particular, to flatten an insulating layer. FIGS. 1 - 3 are cross sectional view, useful in 
explaining a conventional method for manufacturing a 
semiconductor device. First, an insulating layer 1 on a 
silicon substrate (not shown), and then an Aℓ-Si-Cu wiring 
layer 2a of a thickness of 1.0 µm is deposited on 
the lowermost insulating layer 1 by sputtering. The 
wiring layer 2a is patterned by photolithography, 
thereby forming a lower wire 2 on the insulating layer 
1. Thereafter, a first SiO₂ insulating layer 3 of a 
thickness of 1 µm is formed on the lower wire 2 and 
the insulating layer 1 by the use of CVD (Chemical Vapor 
Deposition). The insulating layer 3 is coated with a 
resist layer 4 having a thickness of 0.6 µm by a 
rotational coating method. Then, as is shown in FIG. 2, a resist etchback 
method is used to flatten the first insulating layer 3. 
Specifically, the resist layer 4 and the first insulating 
layer 3 are etched back by a RIE (Reactive Ion 
Etching) method, using an etching ratio of 1.2 : 1.0. 
As a result, the resist layer 4 is etched back by a 
thickness of 0.6 µm, and the first insulating layer 3 
is etched back by a thickness of 0.4 µm. As is shown in FIG. 3, a second SiO₂ insulating  
 
layer 5 of a thickness of 0.4 µm is formed on the 
first insulating layer 3 by the CVD. Thus, an 
interlayer insulating film consisting of first and 
second insulating layers 3 and 5 is provided on the 
insulating layer 1 and the lower wire 2. Subsequently, 
a via hole 7a is formed in that portion of the interlayer 
insulating film 7 which is located on the lower 
wire 2 by the use of the photolithography and RIE 
methods. An Aℓ-Si upper wire 6 having a thickness of 
1.0 µm and a predetermined pattern is provided in the 
via hole 71 and on the interlayer insulating film 7, 
thus completing two-layered wiring. Since in the above-described conventional method, 
the resist layer 4 is coated with the first insulating 
layer 3 by means of the rotational coating method; the 
thickness 4a of that portion of the resist layer 4, 
which is deposited on a wider portion of the wire 2, is 
inevitably greater than the thickness 4b of that portion 
of the resist layer 4, which is deposited on a narrower 
portion of the wire 2. Specifically, in the case of the 
above-described semiconductor device, the thickness 4a 
of the resist layer 4 deposited on that portion of the 
wire 2 which has a
