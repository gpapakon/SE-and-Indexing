<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aromatic and 
heteroaromatic compounds with nonlinear optical (NLO) 
properties. In particular, the present invention 
relates to NLO compounds having improved chemical and 
thermal stability. The compounds of the present invention are 
stable in processing solvents and at processing 
temperatures used in the production of electro-optic 
devices. When suitably oriented, the compounds are 
capable of highly efficient second harmonic generation 
and electro-optic modulation of an electromagnetic wave 
having a wavelength between 300 nm and 2,000 nm. The 
present invention further relates to polymer 
compositions of the disclosed compounds. Highly efficient NLO materials capable of 
doubling or tripling the frequency of incident light are 
currently of great scientific and technological interest 
for use in optical telecommunications, signal processing 
and the construction of optical computers. Nonlinear 
optics is concerned with the interaction of 
electromagnetic fields in various media to produce new 
fields which may be altered in phase, frequency or 
amplitude. The NLO effect of a material upon an 
electromagnetic field is a function of the second and 
higher order terms of the following equation:

P=αE+βE²+γE³+. . . 


 
P is the polarization of a material, E is the intensity 
of electric field, and the coefficients α, β and γ, etc. 
are indicative of the NLO susceptibility of the 
material. Such coefficients are constant for a given 
material, but vary from material to material. The 
second order coefficient, β, for a given material, is  
 
indicative of the second harmonic generation properties 
of the material, with second harmonic generation 
efficiencies increasing as the value of β increases. Candidate NLO materials should possess good 
physical properties, such as high optical transparency, 
low dielectric constant and high laser damage threshold. 
The materials should also possess the molecular 
nonlinearity required of NLO materials, in particular, 
high β values, fast response times and nonlinear 
susceptibility over a broad range of wavelengths, 
particularly of wavelengths between about 300 nm and 
2,000 nm. Recent efforts in the development of NLO 
materials have focused upon non-centrosymmetric organic 
materials with large delocalized pi-electron systems, 
which exhibit great nonlinear susceptibilities and can 
be varied to optimize the desired physical and 
mechanical properties. This includes the single benzene 
ring derivative disclosed by U.S.
