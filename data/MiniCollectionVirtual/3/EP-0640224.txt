<DESCRIPTION>
 MECHANICAL MOUNTINGThis invention relates to a substantially kinematic mounting for a rigid object and finds particular application in the mounting of optical elements in an interferometer. 5 Traditional methods of holding rigid objects firmly in place can make the maintenance of the objects difficult. In • interferometers the optical elements must be held firmly but without distortion and the usual methods of gluing or bolting the element in place makes re-aligning and replacing those elements 10 troublesome.A substantially kinematic mount for a rigid object comprising planar, linear and point contact constraining means is provided. At least one of the constraining means comprises a rigid body and a resilient body which together are adapted to 15 urge said rigid object into contact with the other two of the constraining means.The rigid body and the resilient body may together synthesize either a point force, a linear force or a planar force on the object. 20 The resilient body may be made of polytetrafluorethene(PTFE) or another suitably elastic material and may be substantially tubular, cylindrical or spherical in shape.Alternatively, the resilient body may be a spring or spring like device. 25 Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the following drawings, in whichFigure 1 shows a substantially kinematic mounting for a block, andFigure 2 shows an Michelson interferometer employing the mounting. 30 A block (1) is constrained between a rigid pin (2), the faces (3 and 4) of rigid blocks (5 and 6) and a tubular spring- ' like member (7) made of PTFE. The pin and the rigid blocks are'«• mounted on a support surface (8). The face (3) of rigid block (5) and the spring-like member (7) cooperate to create a force which 35 urges the block (1) into contact with the pin and the planar face(4) of the rigid block (6). 

 In figure 2 a beamsplitter block (1) and a compensator plate block (11) of a michelson interferometer, substantially as described in patent application GB90-19647, are mounted using a substantially kinematic mounting as shown in figure 1. Two rigid blocks (5 and 6) and two rigid pins (2 and 12) are mounted on a support surface (8). A tubular spring-like member (7) and a rigid face (3) of the rigid block (5) cooperate to create a force which urges the beamsplitter (1) into contact with the pin (2) and the planar face (4) of rigid block (6). Similarly, the tubular spring-like member (17) and the rigid face (13) of the rigid block (5) cooperate to create a force which
