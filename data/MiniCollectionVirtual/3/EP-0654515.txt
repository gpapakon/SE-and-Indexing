<ABSTRACT>
A method for obtaining antistatic polymer materials involves introducing into the polymer compound during processing 
an antistatic agent in the form of a solution in an organic solvent of an antistatic compatible with the polymer matrix. At least 

one of the following is used as the antistatic: organic and inorganic salts, complex compounds and bases. The compound is 
treated at temperatures not exceeding the minimum boiling point or decomposition temperatures of the antistatic agent and 

solvent. An organic acid is also added to the mixture. The organic solvents used will be glycols or ethers and their derivatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical technology
and particularly, to methods for production of antistatic
polymer materials by introducing antistatic additives into
them. These materials can be utilized for production of
various polymer coatings.It is common knowledge that a reduction of
electrostatic polarization of polymer coatings provides an
improvement of environmental conditions for human
activity. Therefore a considerable number of inventions
are aimed at the development of methods for improving the
antistatic characteristics of polymer materials.One of the most widely used methods for reducing the
static electricity of polymer materials and compositions
based thereon, is to introduce antistatic agents into
these materials.Particularly known in the art is a method for
reducing static electricity of polymer materials by the
introduction of various amine derivatives into these
materials (SU,A,484238).However, use of nitrogen-containing additives in said
prior art has an adverse effect upon the thermal stability
of polymer materials, and coatings based thereon, for
example, floor coatings, possess low antistatic
properties.Also known in the art is a method for production of
antistatic polymer composition by introduction into a
polymer composition during processing thereof of the
antistatic agent Syntamide-5 (Standard Technological
Regulation for Polyvinyl Chloride Linoleum Production,
All-Union Research and Design Institute for Polymer
Construction Material, Moscow, 1986, pp. 6, 44). The basic disadvantage of said prior art is an
essentially limited antistatic effect achieved by the use
thereof. This is caused by the fact that an insufficient
quantity of antistatic agent does not ensure appropriate
antistatic properties, whereas the excessive introduction
of Syntamide-5 into a composition results in a high
"sweating out" of the antistatic agent and reduces the
processability of said composition.The closest prior art with respect to the present
invention is a method for production of antistatic polymer
materials, including an introduction of an antistatic
agent in a form of an antistatic agent solution into a
polymer composition during processing thereof
(SU,A,1390230). In said prior art, the antistatic
agent are aqueous solutions of substances capable to
hydrate water of crystallization in a solid state. Such
substances can be solid conductive mineral filling agents.Said prior art allows one to produce polymer coatings
possessing sufficiently high antistatic properties.
