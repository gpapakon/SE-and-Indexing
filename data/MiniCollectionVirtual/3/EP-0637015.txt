<ABSTRACT>
A prerecorded magnetic master web (54) and an 
unrecorded magnetic slave web (14), such as a photographic 

film having a magnetic coating, are brought into intimate 
contact for anhysteretic recording by wrapping the moving 

master web partially around a small diameter gimballed 
roller (66) positioned in close proximity to a rotating 

transfer drum (36); wrapping the moving slave web partially 
around a larger idler roller (34) p
ositioned in close proximity 
to both the gimballed roller and the transfer drum; 

wrapping the slave web partially around the transfer drum 
with the master web wrapped outside the slave web; and evacuating 

a chamber or volume (68) formed among the webs, 
rollers and drum, to remove air from between the webs and 

cause them to converge into intimate contact at a nip up-stream 
of a signal transfer zone in which a magnetic head 

(70) applies a decaying magnetic field to cause anhysteretic 
transfer from the master web to the slave web.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anhysteretic recording
apparatus in which signals on a master magnetic medium
are transferred to a slave magnetic medium while the
media travel in intimate contact and without relative
motion through a signal transfer zone. More
particularly, the invention concerns such apparatus
which is capable of attaining recording speeds, for
example, in excess of 2540 mm per second. The
invention is especially suitable for transferring
magnetically encoded information from a thin master web
coated with a high coercivity magnetic medium to a
substantially thicker photographic film web coated on
one side with a photosensitive coating and on the
opposite side with a transparent, low density slave
magnetic medium. The slave magnetic medium may also be
cocast into the support surface opposite the
photosensitive coating.Apparatus and methods are known for making
duplicate magnetic records using anhysteretic or
thermoremanent transfer. Typically, a web on which the
master recording has been made and a web onto which a
mirror image of the master recording is to be
transferred are caused to travel in intimate contact
through a signal transfer zone where a decaying,
alternating magnetic field is applied for anhysteretic
recording or a beam of energy is applied for 
thermoremanent transfer. Inadequate contact or
slippage between the master and slave introduces
modulation and distortion of the magnetic signal being
transferred. Such distortion affects signal quality
and may introduce errors in digital data signals which
are transferred to the slave. The problem of
maintaining intimate contact between the master and
slave webs is aggravated when the webs are driven at
speeds in excess of 1524 mm per second and when the
webs are as wide as 35 mm. At such speeds the webs are
likely to entrain boundary layers of air which tend to
separate them, in spite of tension or pressure applied
to the webs. The difficulty of obtaining the required
intimate contact between wider master and slave webs in
the signal transfer zone has limited use of contact
duplication processes for such webs, particularly when
highly reliable transfer is required.In order to maintain intimate contact in the
signal transfer zone it has been proposed to use
pressure pads, pressure rollers or belts and air
clamps. Various air or pneumatic clamp designs have
been proposed, some including vacuum clamps. Where
excess air pressure has been used to press the webs
into contact, as much as five times atmospheric
pressure has been used for

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for anhysteretically transferring
signals from a first to a second recording medium

carried respectively by first (54) and second (14)
webs, of the type including: means (16-32, 38-52, 56-62)

for transporting the webs under tension along paths
which converge to form a signal transfer zone wherein

the webs are in intimate overlying contact; and

means (70) for applying a decaying magnetic field
to the webs in the signal transfer zone to cause the

transferring, characterized by:
means (34, 38, 66, 68, 73-114) for forming a
vacuum chamber upstream of the signal transfer zone

between the converging webs which chamber has edge
walls defined in part by the webs as they converge.
The apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein
the means for forming a vacuum chamber includes:

   a first drum (36) having a first peripheral
surface a segment of which extends through the signal

transfer zone; a first roller (66) having a second
peripheral surface around a segment of which the first

web is wrapped; the first drum and the first roller
being in proximity with each other to define a nip

between the first and second webs where they come into
intimate contact; the first and second webs being

wrapped in intimate contact around the segment of the
first peripheral surface downstream of the nip. 
The apparatus according to Claim 2 further
characterized by:

   a second roller (34) having a third peripheral
surface around a segment of which the second web is

wrapped, the third peripheral surface also defining an
edge wall of the vacuum chamber.
The apparatus according to Claim 3 further
characterized by:

   first and second support plates (76, 78) having
surfaces (82, 84) generally perpendicular to axes of

rotation of the first drum and of the first and second
rollers, the surfaces of the support plates facing each

other and defining side walls (86, 88) of the vacuum
chamber; and at least one vacuum port (104, 106) formed

in at least one of the facing surfaces for exhausting
the vacuum chamber in a direction transverse to the

webs.

the second roller is in proximity with the first drum

and the first roller, so that the vacuum chamber has a
first apex (102) at the nip, a second apex (98) between

the first drum and the second roller and a third apex
(100) between the first and second rollers.
The apparatus according to Claim 5 wherein
the first and second rollers are spaced from each other

adjacent to the third apex, the first web extending
around the first roller at third apex to define a

leakage path into the vacuum chamber between the first
web and the peripheral surface of the second roller;

and means including the second web for rotating the
second roller in a direction opposite to the first

roller so that the peripheral surface of the second
roller moves in a direction outwardly of the vacuum 

chamber and counteracts flow of air into the vacuum
chamber via the leakage path.
The apparatus according to Claim 4 further
characterized by:

   a length of the second web which extends across
the vacuum port while traveling from the second roller

to the nip, the length having a droop therein which is
a function of the pressure at the port and the tension

in the webs, the pressure in the vacuum chamber being
variable in accordance with the extent of the droop

across the port.
The apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein
the means for transporting is characterized by:

   a third roller (64) having an axis of rotation,

segment of which extends through the signal transfer

zone;
the first and second webs are wrapped in intimate
contact around the segment;
the second web is disposed against the first

effect to form in the transfer zone a nest facing

radially outwardly from the first peripheral surface;
and
the first web is disposed in the nest against the
second web whereby longitudinal edges of the first web

also curl radially outwardly due to anticlastic effect,
the curl of the first web being much less than the curl

the first web is a magnetic record master having

opposite side surfaces with a coating of magnetizable
material on at least one of the opposite side surfaces;
