<ABSTRACT>
The first terminal (T1), for each of the N channels to be aligned, measures a channel round-trip transit time between the two terminals (T1, T2) by looping back into the second terminal (T2) the outward path channel onto the associated return path channel together forming each of the said N channels, then by sending a sequence in the output path channel. A crossed-over channel round-trip transit time is then measured by this first terminal (T1), for each of the N channels, by looping back into the second terminal the outward path channel onto a respective one of the return path channels of the N channels which is different from the return path channel associated with each of the said N channels. Respective corrector delays between outward path channels on the one hand and between return path channels on the other hand are calculated by resolving a system of linear equations resulting from these measurements of channel and cross-over channel round-trip transit times for the N channels.
