<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention a luminescent article is disclosed comprising a self-supporting or supported layer of phosphor particles dispersed in a binding medium and a protective coating thereover characterised in that the binding medium substantially consists of one or more hydrogenated styrene-diene block copolymers, having a saturated rubber di-block or tri-block having a styrene endblock on respectively one or both sides of the said di-block or tri-block, as rubbery and/or elastomeric polymers. The ratio by volume of phosphor to binding medium is more than 70/30 and preferably more than 85/15. By said hydrogenated diene copolymers, for use as rubbery and/or elastomeric polymers, the phosphor layer has improved elasticity of the screen, high protection against mechanical damage and thus high ease of manipulation and high pigment to binder ratio without getting deteriorated by ageing after frequent reuse.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radiation-sensitive luminescent 
articles comprising a coated layer of phosphor particles in a 
binder. In radiography the interior of objects is reproduced by means of 
penetrating radiation which is high energy radiation belonging to 
the class of X-rays, γ-rays and high energy elementary particle 
radiation, e.g. β-rays, electron beam or neutron radiation. For the 
conversion of penetrating radiation into visible light and/or 
ultraviolet radiation luminescent substances are used called 
phosphors. In a conventional radiographic system an X-ray radiograph is 
obtained by X-rays transmitted imagewise through an object and 
converted into light of corresponding intensity in a so-called 
intensifying screen (X-ray conversion screen) wherein phosphor 
particles absorb the transmitted X-rays and convert them into 
visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation whereto a photographic 
film is more sensitive than to the direct impact of the X-rays. In practice the light emitted imagewise by said screen irradiates 
a contacting photographic silver halide emulsion layer film which 
after exposure is developed to form therein a silver image in 
conformity with the X-ray image. For use in common medical radiography the X-ray film comprises a 
transparant film support double-side coated with a silver halide 
emulsion layer. During the X-ray irradiation said film is arranged 
in a cassette between two X-ray conversion screens each of them 
making contact with their corresponding silver halide emulsion 
layer. Single side coated silver halide emulsion films combined in 
contact with only one screen are often used in autoradiography, in  
 
applications where improved image definition is of great importance 
e.g. in mammography and in particular fields of non-destructive 
testing (NDT) known as industrial radiography. An autoradiograph is 
a photographic record formed through the intermediary of penetrating 
radiation emitted by radioactive material contained in an object, 
e.g. microtome cut for biochemical research. Phosphors suitable for use in the conventional radiographic 
system must have a high prompt emission on X-ray irradiation and low 
after-glow in favour of image-sharpness. More recently an X-ray recording system has been developed 
wherein photostimulable storage phosphors are used that in addition 
to their immediate light emission (prompt emission) on X-ray 
irradiation, have the property to store temporarily a large part of 
the energy of the X-ray image which energy is
