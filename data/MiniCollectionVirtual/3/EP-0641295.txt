<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for purifying waste water, comprising a reservoir (2), supply means (3) for the waste water flowing out into the reservoir, means for maintaining a pre-determined fluid level (11) in the upper part of the reservoir and draining means (12) for draining purified water from the reservoir. Said reservoir forms part of a cycle of microbe supporting elements (8) that have a lower density than 1, and comprising means (15) for removing microbe supporting elements from the reservoir operative above the pre-determined level, cleaning means (17) for removing sludge from the supporting elements, and re-introducing means (20) flowing out into the lower part of the reservoir for re-introducing the cleaned microbe supporting elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for purifying 
waste water, in particular for removing organic waste 
material therefrom through biological fermentation, as known 
from EP-A-0 356 870. The device according to the invention comprises a 
reservoir, supply means for the waste water flowing out into 
the reservoir, means for maintaining a pre-determined fluid 
level in the upper portion of the reservoir, means for 
draining off purified water from the reservoir, said 
reservoir forming part of a cycle of microbe supporting 
elements having a density lower than 1, comprising elements 
operative above the pre-determined level for removing the 
microbe supporting elements from the reservoir, cleaning 
means for removing sludge from the supporting elements, and 
re-introducing means flowing out near the bottom of the 
reservoir for the cleaned microbe supporting elements. Microbe cultures grow on the microbe supporting 
elements that decompose the organic waste matter. After the 
microbe supporting elements have remained in the reservoir 
for a certain period of time the supporting elements are 
covered with decomposition products in the form of sludge. 
Because the supporting elements have a lower density than 1 
these will be pushed up to the top of the reservoir above 
the pre-determined fluid level by the supporting elements 
underneath in the fluid. Before the supporting elements are 
taken out of the reservoir these will be out of the fluid 
for some time and the adhering fluid will drip down. The 
relatively dry microbe supporting elements will then be 
taken out of the reservoir and the sludge will be removed 
therefrom in the cleaning means. Hence the released sludge 
has a relatively low water content and can be transported 
off in an economic way. After having passed the cleaning 
means the microbe supporting elements will for the most part 
be without any sludge but will still carry a large quantity  
 
of microbes. As soon as the supporting elements have been 
fed back into the reservoir, they can become immediately 
active. For a correct guiding of the microbe supporting 
elements in the upper part of the reservoir preferably the 
measure of claim 2 is adopted. A favourable further development of the device 
according to the invention is characterized in claim 3. 
While the microbe supporting elements stay in the reservoir, 
the purified water enters the toptank through the holes. The 
purified water is removed from the toptank. Herewith preferably the measure of claim 4 is 
adopted. If along
