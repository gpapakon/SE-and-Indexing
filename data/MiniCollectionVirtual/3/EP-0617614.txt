<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, there are provided methods to modulate processes mediated by retinoid receptors, employing high affinity, high specificity ligands for such receptors. In one aspect of the present invention, there are provided ligands which are more selective for the retinoid X receptor than is retinoic acid (i.e., rexoids). In another aspect of the present invention, alternative ligands (other than retinoic acid) have been discovered which are capable of inducing retinoic acid receptor mediated processes. In yet another aspect, methods have been developed for the preparation of such retinoid receptor ligands from readily available compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intracellular
receptors, and ligands therefor. In a particular aspect, the
present invention, relates to the use of compounds of
structure A and I-VII as specified in the description for the
manufacture of a medicament for modulating processes mediated
by retinoid receptors.A central problem in eukaryotic molecular biology
continues to be the elucidation of molecules and mechanisms
that mediate specific gene regulation in response to
exogenous inducers such as hormones or growth factors. As
part of the scientific attack on this problem, a great deal
of work has been done in efforts to identify exogenous
inducers which are capable of mediating specific gene
regulation.Although much remains to be learned about the
specifics of gene regulation, it is known that exogenous
inducers modulate gene transcription by acting in concert
with intracellular components, including intracellular
receptors and discrete DNA sequences known as hormone
response elements (HREs).As additional members of the steroid/thyroid
superfamily of receptors are identified, the search for
exogenous inducers for such newly discovered receptors
(i.e., naturally occurring (or synthetic) inducers) has
become an important part of the effort to learn about the
specifics of gene regulation.The retinoid members of the steroid/thyroid
superfamily of receptors, for example, are responsive to
compounds referred to as retinoids, which include retinoic 
acid, retinol (vitamin A), and a series of natural and
synthetic derivatives which have been found to exert
profound effects on development and differentiation in a
wide variety of systems.The identification of compounds which interact
with retinoid receptors, and thereby affect transcription
of genes which are responsive to retinoic acid (or other
metabolites of vitamin A), would be of significant value,
e.g., for therapeutic applications.Recently, a retinoic acid dependent transcription
factor, referred to as RAR-alpha (retinoic acid receptor-alpha),
has been identified. Subsequently, two additional
RAR-related genes have been isolated; thus there are now at
least three different RAR subtypes (alpha, beta and gamma)
known to exist in mice and humans. These retinoic acid
receptors (RARs) share homology with the superfamily of
steroid hormone and thyroid hormone receptors and have been
shown to regulate specific gene expression by a similar
ligand-dependent mechanism [Umesono et al., Nature 336: 262
(1988)]. These RAR subtypes are expressed in distinct
patterns
