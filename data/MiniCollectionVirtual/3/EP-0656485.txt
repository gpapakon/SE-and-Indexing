<ABSTRACT>
A baulkring-type synchronizer (18) for frictionally synchronizing 
and positive connecting gears (14,16) to a shaft (12). The synchronizer 

includes a plurality of tabs (54,56) with self-energizing ramps (54a,54b and 
56a,56b) which react synchronizing torque to self-energizing ramps defined 

by an axially slidable shift sleeve (34) secured against rotation relative to the 
shaft. Synchronizing is provided by cone clutch surfaces (24,48) and 

(26,50) which are engaged by an operator shift force (F
o
) and an additive 
force (F
a
), which forces are both applied to the cone clutch surfaces via 
angled blocker teeth surfaces (36a,44a and 36b,46a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clutch of the baulkring synchronizer type having self-energizing. Clutches of the Baulkring synchronizer type for use in multi-ratio 
transmissions are well known. Such clutches include pairs of friction and 
jaw members for respectively synchronizing and positive clutching a gear to a 
shaft, pre-energizer assemblies for engaging the friction members in response 
to initial engaging movement of a shift sleeve, a hub rotatably fixed to the shaft 
and having external spline teeth slidably receiving internal spline teeth of the 
shift sleeve which often defines one of the jaw member pairs, a baulkring having 
blocker teeth for arresting engaging movement of the shift sleeve until 
synchronization is reached and for transferring a shift force from the sleeve to 
increase the engaging force of the friction members. It is also known in the multiple ratio transmission art that 
synchronizer clutches may be used to reduce shift time of all or some of 
the transmission gear ratios. It is also known that the shift effort required by a 
vehicle operator, i.e., force applied to a shift lever, may be reduced by use of 
synchronizer mechanisms of the self-energizing type. Since operator shift effort 
generally increases with vehicle size and weight, synchronizer mechanisms of 
the self-energizing type are especially important for trucks, particularly for heavy 
duty trucks. A baulkring-type synchronizer clutch of the self-energizing type may be 
seen by reference to U.S. Patent 3,548,983. 
A pin-type synchronizer of the self-energizing type may also be seen 
by reference to U.S. Patent 5,092,439. An object of this invention is to provide a baulkring-type 
synchronizer with improved self-energizing.  
 According to the invention, a clutch, as 
disclosed in US-A-3548983, which represents the prior 
art as referred to in the pre-characterising part of 
claim 1, frictionally 
synchronizes and positive connects first and second drives disposed for 
relative rotation about a common axis. The clutch comprises first jaw 
means movable from a neutral position to an engaged position with a second 
jaw means for positive connecting the drives in response to engaging 
movement of the first jaw means by an axially directed first shift force Fo. 
The first jaw means includes a central opening having internal splines with 
axially extending flank surfaces slidably mating continuously with axially 
extending flank surfaces of external splines for preventing relative rotation 
between the internal and
