<ABSTRACT>
In a wire-cut EDM apparatus for cutting a workpiece (2) 
submerged in a processing tank (3) filled with a machining 

fluid (15), an opening (24) is made in the side wall of the 
tank through which an arm unit passes. A slide plate (14) 

also has an opening for passage of the arm unit and also 
prevents leakage from the space between the opening (24) 

and the arm unit. A low frictional member may be placed between 
the arm unit and the slide plate for axially sealing 

the arm unit. Frictional resistance from movement of the 
lower arm unit is reduced and machining accuracy improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
wire-cut electroerosion apparatus. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a wire-cut electrical
discharge machining ("EDM") apparatus for performing
submerged machining.In wire-cut EDM, electrical discharge machining
may be performed with the workpiece submerged in a
processing tank that is filled with a machining fluid. A
wire electrode runs between an upper guide head and a
lower guide head with the two guide heads mounted on an
upper arm unit and a lower arm unit, respectively.In such machines, an opening is made in the
processing tank for inserting the lower arm unit with the
lower guide head into the tank. Positioning of the workpiece
relative to the wire electrode is accomplished by
moving the processing tank in two orthogonal directions
in a plane parallel to its base. One direction is parallel
to the axis of the lower arm unit and the other
direction is parallel to the tank wall having the opening.In this type of wire-cut EDM apparatus, the
space between the opening and the lower arm unit must be
sealed to prevent leakage of the machining fluid from the
processing tank. Various configurations for sealing proposed
in the past are illustrated in U.S. Patent No.
4,565,915 to Girardin, U.S. Patent No. 4,918,279 to Babel
et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,647,747 to Goto, U.S. Patent
No. 4,808,786 to Shinkai, et al., and U.S. Patent No.
4,992,640 to Tanaka, et al. As shown in Figure 11, some
of these conventional arrangements use a sealing plate 4
provided between the opening 3 and the lower arm unit 1.
Sealing members are then placed between the sealing plate
4 and the wall of the processing tank 2 and also between 
the wall and the lower arm unit 1. The positioning of
sealing members between the sealing plate 4 and the lower
arm unit 1, however, creates a problem in terms of frictional
resistance, also called the sealing resistance.
Among other problems, the sealing resistance may cause
the lower arm unit to deform thereby degrading machining
accuracy.From EP-A-0 133 160 it is known to have the lower arm
tightly pass through a plate which is linearily moveable in
parallel to the wall of the processing tank. This plate is
slidingly guided in an also fluid-tight manner with respect
to the wall of the tank. This latter sealing necessitates a
significant force to overcome the friction. The friction
forces created by this sealing provisions tend to bend the
lower arm. Furtheron, the seal between lower arm and plate
has to withstand the forces needed to
