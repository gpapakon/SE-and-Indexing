<ABSTRACT>
A control system for power delivered to an 
inductive load includes the ability to share a single 

inverter power source (16) among plural inductive loads 
(10). The plural inductive loads may have different 

resonant frequencies. The control system causes a 
preselected amount of power to be drawn from the 

inverter power source and delivered to the loads in a 
time-shared manner. The control system varies the phase 

shift between load voltage and load current and 
selectably adjusts the amount of variation in response 

to overshoot and/or undershoot of power drawn from the 
inverter and delivered to a load which can occur when 

switching between loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and a method for
distributing power from a single inverter power source to plural inductive loads and
controlling timing of the delivery of the power to the plural inductive loads. The
invention varies the phase shift between load voltage and load current and selectably
adjusts the amount of variation in response to overshoot and/or undershoot of power
output which can occur when switching between loads. The invention is particularly
useful in distributing power to plural induction furnaces or to plural zones of a single
inductive load but is by no means limited to such uses.Induction heating involves the heating of a nominally electrically-conducting
material (i.e., a metal charge) by eddy currents induced by a time-varying
electromagnetic field. Typically the metal charge is placed in a furnace comprising
a refractory crucible surrounded by a liquid-cooled copper coil. Electrical power
in the form of alternating current from 50 Hz to 60,000 Hz is supplied to the coil
from a suitable power supply. This creates an alternating electromagnetic field
around the coil. Heat is produced in the metal charge by means of the eddy currents
induced in the charge by the electromagnetic field surrounding the coil.One type of power source for supplying the high frequency ac is a
solid state power supply which utilizes high-power thyristor solid-state devices such
as silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). A block diagram of a typical induction
heating apparatus (e.g., an induction furnace) and an inverter power supply for the 
furnace which employs SCRs is described and depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 of U.S.
Patent 5,165,049.An induction furnace is one type of inductive load. U.S. Patent
5,165,049 describes the problem of matching the resonant frequency of the inductive
load with the resonant frequency of the inverter power supply so as to maximize
energy transfer therebetween, in view of the constantly changing resonant frequency
of the load and the need to avoid making the frequencies exactly identical. If the
frequencies are made identical, the power supply will short out for reasons discussed
in that patent. As that patent also describes, the resonant frequency of the load
constantly varies. For example, the resonant frequency of a metal charge in a
furnace varies as the composition changes and as it is heated, cooled, and as metal
is added to or removed from the crucible. U.S. Patent 5,165,049 also discloses
circuitry for solving the problem of identical frequency of power
