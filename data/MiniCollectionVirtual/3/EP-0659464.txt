<ABSTRACT>
Advanced membrane compositions having high 
permeability characteristics, and optimal operating 

temperatures above ambient during only a portion of the 
year, are operated with a controlled reduction in 

operating feed air pressure under rising ambient 
temperature conditions. The overall efficiency of the 

air separation process is enhanced, and power 
requirements are significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - This invention relates to
the use of membranes for the recovery of nitrogen from
air. More particularly, it relates to the operation of
such membranes under variable temperature conditions.Description of the Prior Art - Recent developments
relating to permeable membranes have served to
significantly reduce the cost of on-site systems for
the production of relatively low purity, small tonnage
nitrogen. The inherent simplicity of permeable
membrane systems provides a strong incentive for the
development of such systems to satisfy the requirements
of a wide variety of commercial operations. The
availability of hollow fiber membranes and membrane
modules has enhanced the development of simple
processes and systems for the production of product
nitrogen and oxygen from air.In the use of membranes for air separation, feed
air is compressed and passed along the outside (inside)
of a hollow fiber membrane bundle, with oxygen
preferentially permeating through the surface of the
membrane and with nitrogen being preferentially
retained as a non-permeate or retentate stream on the
feed side of the membrane. As it progresses through
the membrane, the retentate stream becomes richer in
nitrogen, so that the retentate is withdrawn from the
discharge end of the module, on the feed side thereof,
as a nitrogen-rich product.The efficiency of membrane processes for air
separation depends on the properties of the membrane 
material employed and on the parameters of the
operating process. Two membrane material properties
are of particular significance, namely the
permeability/thickness ratio for oxygen, Po/t, and the
selectivity, or separation factor, α, which is the
ratio of the permeability of oxygen to that of
nitrogen. The membrane process efficiency is enhanced
when both of these factors is increased. Both factors
are temperature-dependent. In general, the value of
(Po/t) increases with increasing temperature, while the
value of α decreases as the temperature is increased.
For fixed values of pressure and other operating
variables, there is thus an optimum operating
temperature. The range of properties available from
many early hollow-fiber membrane materials was such
that the optimum operating temperature was above
ambient temperature. It is relatively easy to attain
and conduct membrane air separation operations at this
above ambient temperature, as by utilizing some or all
of the heat of compression of the feed air or by modest
heating of the feed stream. For consistent operation,
membrane
