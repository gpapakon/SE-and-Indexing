<ABSTRACT>
An actuating device for a vehicle top (soft-top) (2) and a top receptacle cover (3) of a motor vehicle comprises an actuating lever (12) and an adjustment device (14), in which case, using the actuating lever (12) which can be pivoted from the seat (8) on the driver's side, the top receptacle cover (3) can be moved between a closed position (BSD1) and an open position (BSD2) and the top (2) can be moved between a second operating position (BSV2) and a third operating position (BSV3). In order to develop an actuating drive of the generic type mentioned at the beginning in such a way that it is simple in design and functions well, it avoids incorrect operations and is easy to handle, there is provision that by pivoting the actuating lever (12) in a first direction the top cover receptacle (3) is moved by means of the adjustment device (14) which interacts with it from a closed position (BSD1) into an open position (BSD2) in which a first coupling component (29) which is operatively connected to the adjustment device (14) assumes a receiving position D in which a second coupling component (30) which is provided on the top (2) can be engaged in the first coupling component (29) when the top (2) is located in the second operating position (BSV2), and that by pivoting the actuating lever (12) again in a second, opposing direction the top receptacle cover (14) and the top (2) are both moved downwards into the closed position (BSV1) or the third operating position (BSV3) by means of the engaged coupling (29).
