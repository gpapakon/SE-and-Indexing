for use in the qualitative or quantitative measurement of 

substances to be assayed, such as proteins, antibodies and 
the like, in a small amount of test samples by a simple and 

easy operation without requiring a B/F separation step, as 
well as a process for the measurement by the measuring 

apparatus. 
More particularly, it provides a simplified measuring 
apparatus for use in the detection of the presence and 

quantity of substances to be assayed in test samples, which 
comprises: (a) a liquid permeable porous reaction membrane 

whose surface having at least one reaction area to which an 
affinity substance capable of directly or indirectly 

capturing a substance to be assayed or a soluble agent is 
immobilized; (b) a porous body arranged on the upper part of 

the porous reaction membrane, to which a soluble agent 
capable of being solubilized by the addition of a test sample 

is adhered in a releasable manner; (c) an absorption member 
arranged on the lower part of the porous reaction membrane, 

which contacts with a periphery, excluding the reaction area, 
of the porous reaction membrane via a liquid non-permeable 

sheet; (d) a liquid non-permeable transparent cover arranged 
on the lower part of the absorption member; and (e) a liquid 

non-permeable case which encloses the foregoing members (a)

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for use in simple 
and quick measurement in which a porous reaction membrane is 
employed, and to a measuring process making use thereof. Measurement of minor constituents in the living body has 
been used frequently for many purposes such as diagnosis of 
various diseases and judgement of therapeutic effects. In 
these days, such measurement is carried out not only at 
medical facilities but also domestically by unskilled persons 
in many cases. Depending on each purpose, diagnostic drugs 
are properly used in an accurate measuring method having high 
sensitivity and high accuracy or in a simplified measuring 
method which is easy to handle and can show results in a 
short time. Especially, since the simplified measuring 
method does not require a reaction apparatus, a measuring 
instrument and the like and is easily practicable by simple 
handling, this is a considerably handy method when a 
diagnosis can be made only by a semi-quantitative or 
qualitative measurement. Because of this, the simplified 
measuring method is used broadly for the diagnosis of 
pregnancy and the like. With regard to the immunoassay, several simplified 
methods are now used commonly which include for example an  
 
agglutination reaction or an agglutination inhibition 
reaction in which latex is used as a carrier, an enzyme 
immunoassay (EIA) in which an enzyme is used as a label and a 
simplified immunological measuring method in which colloidal 
non-metal particle or colored latex is used as a label. In recent years, methods in which porous reaction 
membranes are utilized have been used broadly as simplified 
immunological measuring methods. Almost such methods use 
colored substances directly conjugated to antibodies, unlike 
the case of EIA in which substrates for respective enzymes 
are used in the coloring process. The use of such methods 
has rendered possible further simplified operation and 
shortened assay period in comparison with other prior art 
techniques including the latex-aided agglutination or 
agglutination inhibition reaction and EIA. Illustrative examples of the process and measuring 
apparatus for use in such a type of simplified immunological 
measuring method are those disclosed in JP-A-3-504166 and JP-A-3-176659 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"). In 
these methods, a porous reaction membrane is used as a 
chromatograph strip, a reagent is set on a specified area on 
the surface of the strip and the
