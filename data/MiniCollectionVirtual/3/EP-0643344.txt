<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the modeling and control of
equipment processed in factories which have fabrication and other techniques.
The invention further relates to a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM)
system that includes a factory-specific model for automatic control and to the use
of the models for the design of the CIM systems.Most manufacturing plants or factories are distributed in that they
consist of heterogenous, unconnected factory stations to do work. The virtue of
this factory design is that it provides the adaptability to a varying product mix.
The drawback is the resulting complexity of operations, management, and
quality control.A distributed manufacturing plant is capable of fabricating a variety of
products through an ordered-process sequence of process steps. Each process
step can be performed by at least one station in the factory. Distributed factories
are common in the manufacture of modern electronic products. Six types of
distributed factories can be involved: wafer slicing, wafer fabrication,
semiconductor-component assembly, circuit-board fabrication, circuit-board
assembly, electric-product assembly. The arch type of the distributed factory is a
wafer-fabrication plant or "wafer fab," which may manufacture products
simultaneously according to over 1000 processes, averaging over 100 steps each. wafer fabrication factories with over 1000 fabrication sequences are
known. Such a collection of processes is difficult to represent in a drawing like a
fab graph. Such a factory, however, can be described to a computer system.The complexity of distributed factories is further illustrated by the
existence of tens of thousands of fabrication sequences in a general class of
distributed factory called a "job shop." The standard approach to describing the
collection of sequences in the job shop is to surrender to the complexity and
describe the product class through the factory as being random. These are
clearly not random, but only recently have computers provided the practical
computational power to describe highly complex factories accurately.The factory is a complex, data and information rich entity. The data
structure with tens of thousands of parameters may be required merely to
describe the factory. Furthermore, in operation, a dynamic factory produces
orders of magnitude of data describing the production flows. The sheer volume
of information has made the operation and control of distributed factories a
major problem.Despite the large data volumes and complexity of
