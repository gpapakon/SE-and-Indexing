<ABSTRACT>
A controller regulates a hydraulic pump for 
hydraulic equipment to allow long-term use of 

environmentally safe hydraulic fluids. This is accomplished 
by limiting the hydraulic pump power output to a level 

established to prevent the operating temperature from 
exceeding a specified level. A manual mode for switching 

between power curves permits alternative use of hydraulic 
fluids having different maximum operating temperatures. An 

automatic mode detects the type of hydraulic fluid and 
automatically selects and applies a suitable power mode 

curve to limit the maximum operating temperature to a value 
suitable for the detected type of fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices that control power output of hydraulic 
equipment and particularly to such devices that control the output of hydraulic 
equipment to permit the use of degradable, environmentally-safe, oils for 
hydraulic fluid. Although mineral oils have been used as working fluids for hydraulic 
systems, such as construction equipment, there is a trend, particularly in 
European nations, to proscribe the use of mineral oils under certain conditions 
because such oils are environmentally hazardous. Environmentally safe 
alternatives to mineral oils are available and used in jurisdictions that do not 
allow the use of mineral oils. For example, biodegradable fluids made from 
vegetable oil, such as rape (canola) seed oil, are among these few feasible 
alternatives. Unfortunately, from a practical standpoint, biodegradable working 
fluids are inferior substitutes, in some ways, for mineral oils. Such 
biodegradable fluids are not stable for long periods of time, especially at the 
high temperatures produced by some hydraulic systems. For example, the 
usable temperature range of biodegradable working fluid of a rape seed oil type 
of fluid is from -20°C to +80°C while the temperature of the hydraulic fluid in 
a working hydraulic excavator sometimes exceeds +90°C, despite the use of an 
oil cooler. Thus it is impractical to use such biodegradable working fluids in 
such systems. This is particularly true for systems with oil coolers that are 
sized for use with mineral oils because such systems lack the capacity to 
maintain the lower fluid temperatures required for continuous use of 
biodegradable oils. In countries where use of biodegradable working fluid is required, 
various measures have been adopted to accommodate the lower temperature 
requirements of biodegradable oils. One measure is to change the hydraulic 
fluid before it becomes degraded by increasing the frequency of replacement. 
Another is to increase the capacity of the oil cooler. Still another is to sound an 
alarm when excess temperatures are detected and allow the machine to cool  
 
down. However, these countermeasures present problems. 
Increasing the frequency of changes of the working fluid 
increases the operating cost of the machine. Increasing the 
capacity of the oil cooler adds initial cost to the 
hydraulic equipment. Waiting for the equipment to cool 
down, after excess temperatures are detected, decreases the 
duty cycle of the equipment and increases operating and 
labor costs. JP-A-04 32 5784 discloses
