<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide 
containing mixtures which are suitable to be used as feedstock in 

the epoxidation of olefins, whereby a starting mixture at least 
containing tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide, isobutane and water, is 

introduced into a distillation zone, the conditions in the said 
distillation zone being selected such that an overhead stream is 

formed, containing part of the isobutane and a major part of the 
water, and a bottom stream containing the remaining part of the 

isobutane and substantially all of the tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide containing mixtures, which are 
suitable to be used as feedstock in the epoxidation of olefins. Tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (hereinafter "TBHP") is a well 
known compound which may be used, either as such, or in admixture 
with one or more other compounds, in various industrial applications, 
e.g. as catalyst, as initiator in free-radical type 
reactions, as intermediate in the preparation of oxirane compounds 
such as propeneoxide (cf. Aldrichimica Acta, 12(4), 63 (1979)). A conventional method for preparing TBHP, disclosed in 
US Patent No. 2,845,461, consists in the oxidation of isobutane 
with the aid of molecular oxygen, at elevated temperature and 
pressure. According to US Patent No. 4,408,081, an improved selectivity 
with respect to the desired TBHP, without sacrifice in isobutane 
conversion, is obtained by conducting the oxidation process in a 
cascade of essentially steady-state reaction zones. In general in these isobutane oxidation processes a mixture of 
products is formed, containing besides TBHP, unconverted isobutane, 
tertiary-butanol, water and minor amounts of other by-products, 
such as acetone, methanol and organic acids. For some of the known uses for TBHP, it is desirable, or even 
essential, that the hydroperoxide, or the mixture containing the 
hydroperoxide, is substantially waterfree. In particular if the 
(mixture containing) TBHP is to be used for the preparation of 
oxirane compounds by epoxidation of olefins, it is of paramount 
importance that the hydroperoxide feedstock does not contain more 
than insignificant amounts of water, say less than 1000 ppm. It is known that water can be removed from TBHP by azeotropic 
distillation with methylene chloride or dichloroethane (cf. Chem.  
 
Berichte, 113, 3662-3665 (1980)) or, after addition of toluene, by 
separation using a Dean-Stark apparatus (cf. J. Org. Chem. 1983, 
48, p 3607/8). It will be appreciated that these methods, especially on a 
large scale, are economically not very attractive and, as regards 
the azeotropic drying with dichloroethane, may be hazardous. It is also known that water can be removed from an aqueous 
TBHP containing stream by contacting the said stream with a solid 
absorbant. Again, this procedure, for large scale operations, is 
economically unattractive, as it requires large amounts of 
adsorbant material and moreover may be hazardous, depending on the 
selected adsorbant. Furthermore it has been proposed
