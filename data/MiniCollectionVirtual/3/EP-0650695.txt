<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a method and a device for 
measuring the heartbeat pulse of a person during physical 

performance on an exercise device. The invention includes 
processing of a signal carrying pulse data and indicating the 

pulse frequency to the user of the exercise device. 
Furthermore, the invention comprises the steps of programming 

the exercise device to provide a sequence of exercise to the 
performer, detecting and transmitting during the exercise a 

heartbeat pulse signal with electrodes and a transmitter 
attached to the body of the performer, receiving the 

transmitted pulse signal with a receiver connected to the 
exercise device, processing the received pulse signal, and 

calculating a mean pulse value during the performance and 
presenting the value to the performer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
measurement of the heartbeat of a person during physical
performance on an exercise device, such as a cycle ergometer or
a treadmill.In various kinds of exercising and fitness training, it has
become common to measure the heartbeat with various handheld
measuring devices based on wired or telemetric wireless
transmission between a separate transmitter attached to the body
and a receiver worn on the wrist. Such a device is described in
US Patent 4,625,733, for example.On the other hand, it is known to combine the use of
programmable exercise devices, such as cycle ergometers, with the
use of pulse measuring devices, such as in US Patent 5,067,710.One very significant index of an individual's level of
fitness would be her or his mean pulse value calculated on pulse
values measured during a whole exercise performance. This kind
of index is, however, not useful if the performance varies from
one time to another, which is invariably does in sports, due to
outer circumstances, such as weather, disturbance from other
people, mistakes by the performer himself etc. Looking into this
problem the other way, there has so far not been a reliably and
easily calculated index for indicating a constant level of heart
performance at each fitness test occasion; which means that a
certain heart performance index is the target and the exercise
is continued and/or varied in order to achieve this target index.We have appreciated the desirability of providing a method for
measuring a fitness index, which is easy to measure and calculate,
and which is an accurate indicator of a person's fitness developments
when repeated with any frequency or over any period of time. We have also appreciated the desirability of providing an easy and
reliable way for a person to achieve exactly or nearly exactly a
constant level of performance each time a fitness test according to the
invention is made.We have further appreciated the desirability of combining a
distinctly known device for measuring heartbeat with an exercise device,
such as a cycle ergometer or a treadmill, in order to provide an
apparatus for computing the fitness index according to the invention.Accordingly, there is provided a method for measuring the heartbeat
pulse of a person during physical performance on an exercise device,
including processing a signal carrying pulse data and indicating the
pulse frequency to the user of the exercise device, the method
comprising the steps of:
detecting and transmitting during the
