controllable shunt field winding by means of controlling 

field winding with limiting switch relates to a shunt field 
winding of compound motor which is controlled by means of a 

limiting switch controlled with the operating state of

type limiting switch which gets closed during motor running 
speed is overhigh whereby the assisted exciting type shunt 

winding of compound motor is excited while motor running 
speed is reduced thereof; while motor is running at low 

speed the limiting switch appears closed state. Further the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present compound motor limiting control circuit for 
controllable shunt field winding by means of controlling 
field winding with limiting switch relates to a shunt field 
winding of compound motor which is controlled by means of a 
limiting switch controlled with the operating state of 
motor, and particularly to the control with over-speed close 
type limiting switch which gets closed during motor running 
speed is overhigh whereby the assisted exciting type shunt 
winding of compound motor is excited while motor running 
speed is reduced thereof; while motor is running at low 
speed the limiting switch appears closed state. Further the 
action point of the limiting switch can be controlled to 
change the motor running speed. FIG. 1 is an embodiment showing the compound motor 
limiting control circuit for controllable shunt field 
winding by means of controlling the field winding with 
limiting switch. FIG 2 is an embodiment showing the compound motor 
limiting control circuit for controllable shunt field 
winding by means of controlling the field with centrifugal 
switch. FIG 3 is an embodiment showing the compound motor  
 
limiting control circuit for controllable shunt field 
winding by means of controlling the field winding with 
limiting switch consisted of solid power transistor. The conventional series motor limiting control usually 
relates to a centrifugal switch series between the power 
supply and series motor in which the centrifugal switch will 
cut off power supply during over-speed condition and the 
switch will close while the speed is reduced to obtain a 
speed limiting function thereof. Besides, as each cut-off 
power involves the full power of motor so the motor capacity 
is greatly limited. The present compound motor limiting 
control circuit for controllable shunt field winding by 
means of controlling field winding with limiting switch 
relates to a shunt field winding of compound motor which is 
controlled by means of a limiting switch controlled with the 
operating state of motor, and particularly to the control 
with over-speed close type limiting switch which gets closed 
during motor running speed is overhigh whereby the assisted 
exciting type shunt winding of compound motor is excited 
while motor running speed is reduced thereof; while motor is 
running at low speed the limiting switch appears closed 
state. Further the action point of the limiting switch can 
be controlled to change the motor running speed. The limiting switch of the present design includes: (1)
