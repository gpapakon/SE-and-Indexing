<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retroviral protease inhibitors and, more
particularly relates to novel compounds and a composition and use thereof for
preparing medicaments for inhibiting retroviral proteases This invention, in
particular, relates to N-heterocyclic moiety-containing hydroxyethylamine protease
inhibitor compounds, a composition and use thereof for preparing medicaments for
inhibiting retroviral proteases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
protease and for treatment or prophylaxis of a retroviral infection, e.g., an HIV
infection. The subject invention also relates to processes for making such
compounds as well as to intermediates useful in such processes.During the replication cycle of retroviruses, gag and gag-pol gene products
are translated as proteins. These proteins are subsequently processed by a virally
encoded protease (or proteinase) to yield viral enzymes and structural proteins of
the virus core. Most commonly, the gag precursor proteins are processed into the
core proteins and the pol precursor proteins are processed into the viral enzymes,
e.g., reverse transcriptase and retroviral protease. It has been shown that correct 
processing of the precursor proteins by the retroviral protease is necessary for
assembly of infectious virons. For example, it has been shown that frameshift
mutations in the protease region of the pol gene of HIV prevents processing of the
gag precursor protein. It has also been shown through site-directed mutagenesis
of an aspartic acid residue in the HIV protease that processing of the gag precursor
protein is prevented. Thus, attempts have been made to inhibit vital replication
by inhibiting the action of retroviral proteases.Retroviral protease inhibition typically involves a transition-state mimetic
whereby the retroviral protease is exposed to a mimetic compound which binds
(typically in a reversible manner) to the enzyme in competition with the gag and
gag-pol proteins to thereby inhibit replication of structural proteins and, more
importantly, the retroviral protease itself. In this manner, retroviral proteases can
be effectively inhibited.Several classes of mimetic compounds are known to be useful as inhibitors
of the proteolytic enzyme resin. See, for example, U.S. 4,599,198; G.B.
2,184,730; G.B. 2,209,752; EP O 264 795; G.B. 2,200,115 and U.S. SIR H725.
Of these, G.B. 2,200,115; G.B 2,209,752; EP O 264,795; U.S. SIR H725; and
U.S. 4,599,198 disclose urea-containing hydroxyethylamine renin inhibitors.
