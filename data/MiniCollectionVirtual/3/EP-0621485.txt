<ABSTRACT>
A double-headed spring contact probe (20) for 
loaded board testing includes a barrel (22) having a hollow 

interior (25) and opposed plungers (30,50) which slide 
axially in the barrel. The plungers have outer portions 

(36,58) which extend through the opposite open ends (23,24) 
of the barrel, each terminating in a contact tip (38,60) 

outside the barrel for contacting a test point on a circuit 
board. One of the plungers (30) has a hollow receptacle 

(34) extending into the barrel (22) with a rectangular or 
notched keyway (44) opening into the receptacle. The 

keyway (44) is disposed at an angle of about 6° to the 
longitudinal axis thereof. The other plunger (50) has a 

twisted guide member (54) extending through the barrel into 
the keyway (44) of the other plunger whereby axial translation 

of the plungers (30,58) relative to each other also 
causes a rotation thereof and the keyway (44) rides in the 

groove (56) for electrical contact as translational movement 
occurs. A leafspring is further provided on the 

hollow receptacle (34) adjacent the notched keyway for 
contacting the twisted guide member (54) of the other 

plunger to minimize electrical resistance during axial 
translation. In addition, the plunger (30) may have an 

open end extending from the barrel (22) with inwardly 
directed fingers for engaging a contact tip for retaining 

the same therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electrical probes and, more
particularly, to miniature spring-loaded probes for
providing electrical contact between electrical
components mounted on parallel circuit boards.Testing, diagnosis, maintenance and calibration of
electronic devices often require supplying test signals
to, and receiving signals from, components of a Device
Under Test (DUT) or Unit Under Test (UUT). When an
electronic device is fabricated on one or more circuit
boards, electronic components mounted on the circuit
boards may not be accessible for testing using existing
circuit board mounted connectors. Therefore, connections
to components to be tested are made using external
electrical probes applied to the exposed leads of the
components and/or to a printed circuit board wiring
layer.Automatic testing of electrical circuits requires
simultaneous connection to many circuit test points. The
automatic testing equipment simultaneously supplies 
signals to, and receives signals from, combinations of
test points. A conventional test fixture used to
electrically probe a circuit card of a DUT includes a
"bed of nails" having a platform for supporting the
circuit card and an array of single headed spring probes.
Each spring probe includes a probe head which makes
positive electrical contact with an overlying portion of
the circuit board being tested. An opposite end of each
probe is connected to test equipment through single point
wiring.A conventional single headed electrical test probe
is described by Johnston et al., U.S. Patent 5,032,787
issued July 16, 1991.
The Patent describes a test probe assembly including a
barrel having a hollow interior and a plunger which
slides axially in the barrel. The plunger has an outer
portion extending through an open end of the barrel,
terminating in a contact tip outside the barrel for
contact with a test point and a hollow, elongated
receptacle extending through the barrel. The receptacle
has a square or rectangular pilot hole so that an
elongated fixed guide member in the barrel extends
through the pilot hole. The guide member extends through
the interior of the barrel away from the pilot hole and
has an outer surface which engages the pilot hole. A
spring inside the barrel extends along the guide member
and is biased against the internal end; of the receptacle
inside the barrel.Axial travel of the Johnston et al. plunger into the
barrel is against the spring bias. The outer surface of
the guide member engages the correspondingly shaped pilot
hole and controls

An electrical probe assembly (20) comprising:

a housing (22) having first and second opposite open
ends (23, 24) ;
a first elongated plunger (50) partially positioned
within said housing (22), said first plunger (50) being

rotatable about and slidable along its longitudinal axis within said
housing (22) and having


(i) a first portion (58) extending out from said housing
