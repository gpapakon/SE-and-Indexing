<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid delivery
apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1.
More particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus
for enteral feeding applications.When patients are comatose, or for some reason are unable
to take nourishment by mouth, enteral feeding becomes necessary.
Enteral nutrition, or tube feeding, is typically accomplished
by nasogastric administration or by direct delivery of
liquids to the stomach via a surgically implanted feeding tube.
Parastalic pumps are currently used for nasogastric feeding
when gravity flow from an elevated container is insufficient to
instill flow or when an exact amount of regulated feeding is
necessary. Such devices are cumbersome to use and at times
have proven unreliable.The apparatus of the present invention overcomes the draw-backs
of prior art enteral feeding systems by providing a self-contained
apparatus which includes an internal energy source
that automatically expels prepackaged nutritional liquids from
a sealed aseptic container at a desired uniform rate.Aseptic packaging is, of course, not new. Such packaging
is being used more and more in the food industry for packaging
fruit juice, milk products and the like. Additionally, some
use of aseptic packaging has been made in the medical field for
packaging medical solutions.When the packaged, aseptically filled liquid is a food 
product, such as fruit juice, the sealed package is typically
punctured at a specific site location and the juice is withdrawn
through a straw. When the packaged liquid is a medical
solution, the package is typically opened, mixed with other
components when required and emptied into a traditional, wide-mouth
flexible bag solution container for enteral delivery by
conventional gravity means and parastalic pump. However, in
U.S. Patent No. 4,826,500 issued to Rantsola, a system for the
enteral delivery of a medical solution directly from an aseptic
container is there described. In accordance with the methods
of the Rantsola patent, the solution is passed from a container
through an elongated giving set and metering system into a
nasal tube. The container is an aseptic carton having penetrable
side walls, with the giving set being provided with a
fitting having a fluid passage extending therethrough. The
fitting terminates at a carton cooperating portion which includes
a first portion for penetrating the carton side walls to
form an orifice therein, the orifice establishing fluid communication
between the carton interior and the fitting fluid
passag
