<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a clamp (7) for securing the top cover (3) of a screening machine (1). Clamping is not subject to galling or seizing and the force exerted is not temperature or displacement dependent. The clamp (7) is air pressure operated, with super-atmospheric pressure being applied for clamping and venting to atmosphere or sub-atmospheric pressure being applied to release the clamp. The clamp is mounted for easy swing away movement when not in use so as to permit the top cover (3) to be removed. Multiple clamps (7, 7) may be simultaneously operated from a common manifold (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to screening
machines, and more particularly to means for clamping
and securing a top cover to the screen box of a
screening machine.Commercial screening machines generally have
a removable top cover which extends over and closes
the top of the screen box in which the screen assembly
is mounted. The removable top cover may be completely
detachable from the screen box, or hinged to it along
an edge. The particulate material to be screened is
fed through the cover by an inlet chute which discharges
it onto the top screen of the screen assembly.
The cover encloses the particulate material being
screened, preventing it from being shaken off the
screen, minimizing dust, and preventing the entry of 
dirt and extraneous material. A gasket is often used
between the cover and box to provide a better seal.
From time to time it is necessary to open the cover,
for instance to change or replace a screen or the
entire screen assembly. Because the screen box is
shaken with substantial force in operation, the cover
is typically clamped to the box for movement with it.Various forms of cover hold-down clamps have
been proposed specifically for use on screening
machines, including manually operated over-center
hold-down clamps, for example of the type shown in
Nolte U.S. patent No. 3,433,357. In the use of such
clamps, a clamping member, adjustable by a screw, is
manually engaged with the edge of the cover or frame
and an arm is pulled from one side of a center position
to the other side, so as to draw together the two
members to be clamped. Such manual clamps provide a
strong but inflexible clamping force. However, the
adjusting screws of such clamps over time can become
clogged with dust from the material being screened so
that the screws cannot be easily turned to adjust the
clamps. An additional problem that may be exhibited
by screw type clamps is the tendency of the screw
threads to "gall" or seize with extended use, also
making it harder to turn the screws and adjust the
clamps. With a screw type clamp, the clamping force
applied increases as the screw is turned (i.e., with 
each degree of rotation of the screw). As the
clamping force increases, the normal force and therefore
the frictional force between thread surfaces also
increases, making it harder to turn the screws and
adjust the clamps. This problem can be exacerbated
when the clamps, after being set up, are subjected to
substantial heat in use, as for example when a hat
material is being screened. Thermal expansion of the

<CLAIMS>
A screening machine (1) having a screen box
mounting (5) a screen assembly (4), a removable top cover (3) on

said box, and a plurality of clamps (7) for clamping said
cover and said box together,

   each said clamp comprising:

an inflatable air actuator (9) having opposite
first and second ends (12, 13) and being expandable from an

unpressurized normal condition by internal pressurization;
at least one clamp (18) arm having a pivot end (20)
and an outer end (19), said pivot end being pivotally

mounted to one of said cover and said box, said first
end of said actuator being mounted to the outer end of

said clamp arm,
said cover and said box being clamped
together by pivoting said clamp arm to position said

actuator proximate to a clamping surface (22) provided by
the other of said cover and said box, and pressurizing

said actuator to bring said second end to bear against
said clamping surface.
The machine of claim 1 wherein each said
actuator is connected to a common conduit means for

supplying each with pressurized air, whereby all said
actuators are operated simultaneously by said supply

means. 
The machine of claim 1 wherein each said
actuator is pressurized individually.
The machine of claim 1 wherein clamp arms
are located on opposite sides of said actuator.
The machine of claim 4 wherein the first end
of said actuator and the outer end of each said clamp

arm are connected together by a cross bar.
The machine of claim 1 wherein said actuator
includes a pneumatic pressure port located on a

central axis of said actuator.
The machine of claim 1 wherein each pressurized
actuator is contracted by sub-atmospheric

internal pressure. 
A screening machine having a screen box
mounting (5) a screen assembly (4), a removable top cover (3) on

said box, and a clamping assembly (7) for clamping said
cover and said box together, said clamping assembly

comprising:

a plurality of inflatable air actuators (9),
each having a first end (12) and a second end (13), and 
being
expandable from a normal attitude by internal pressurization;
a cross bar (17) mounted to each of said first
ends;
a plurality of clamp arms (18), each having an
outer end (19) and a pivot end (20) with each outer end being

mounted to said cross bar and each pivot end being
pivotally mounted to one of said cover and said box,

   wherein each said second end can be urged
against a clamping surface (22) provided by the other of

said cover and said box by pivoting said clamp arms to
position said second end proximate to said clamping

surface and pressurizing said actuator; and
a common supply means (10) connected to said
actuators for selectively supplying each with pressurized

air, whereby all said actuators are operated
simultaneously by said supply means.
The machine of claim 8 wherein a conduit
line supplies the pressurized air to each actuator and

is attached to said cross bar.
