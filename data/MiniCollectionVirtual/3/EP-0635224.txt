<ABSTRACT>
A base for containers, intended to contain particularly but not 
exclusively cosmetics products, comprises an outer casing (13) in 

which there is mounted an insert (12) for receiving at least one 
interchangeable cup or pan (11). Said insert (12) can slide 

within said outer casing (13) between two positions, namely a 
first position in which said cup (11) is locked in the casing (13) 

and a second position of release in which said cup (11) can be 
removed, mutual engagement means being provided between the cup 

(11) and insert (12) and between the cup (11) and casing (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base for containers intended to
contain particularly but not exclusively cosmetics products,
provided with a movable insert for retaining one or more
interchangeable cups in a freely removable manner.Said interchangeable cups - generally known as pans in this sector
- contain cosmetics products such as eye shadow, blusher, lip
gloss, rouge powder, face powder, etc.Said containers could however also be used for containing products
of different type, such as parapharmaceuticals or others.As is well known to the expert to the art the construction of
containers in general and/or of cases for containing cosmetics
products such as the aforesaid requires the solution of various
technical problems.One of these is the possibility of reutilizing the container once
its contained product has been used up, by merely replacing the
empty pans, which are available commercially in the form of
specific refills for that container.In this respect, to assure the consumer that the product contained
in the refill is original, it is desirable for the pans and the 
insert incorporated into the container base to comprise precise
corresponding locators so that components of different origin
cannot be fitted in.DE-U-9215092 relates to a base for containers having inserts lockable inside the
casing according to the preamble of claim 1.Another technical problem relates to the facility for replacing
the pans contained in the container with other pans containing a
different cosmetics product or with a different number of modular
pans, with ease and without soiling the fingers.It is also desirable to provide a container with an interior in
which the assembled pans form a patten of pleasing appearance and
which can be varied.The general object of the present invention is to solve the
aforesaid problems in a simple, economical and functional manner,
while at the same time obtaining a container of very flat shape.Said object is achieved by a container base having the
characteristics defined in the claim 1 and dependent claims.The structural and functional characteristics of the invention and
its advantages compared with the known art will be more apparent
from the following description, given with reference to the
accompanying drawings which show one embodiment of a container
base with a movable insert and interchangeable pans formed in
accordance with the innovative principles of the invention. In
the drawings:

<CLAIMS>
A base for containers intended to contain particularly but
not exclusively cosmetics products, of the type comprising an

outer casing (13) in which there is mounted an insert (12) for
receiving at least one interchangeable cup or pan (11),

said insert (12) can slide within said outer
casing (13) between two positions, namely a first position in

which said cup (11) is locked in the casing (13) and a second
position of release in which said cup (11) can be removed, mutual

engagement means being provided between the cup (11) and insert
(12) and between the cup (11) and casing (13),

characterised in
that said insert (12) is constrained to the casing (13) by two

opposing channel-shaped recesses (14) provided externally in the
short sides of the insert (12), the recesses (14) being slidingly

engaged with complementary guides (15) provided on the inside of
the casing (13), said two positions being determined by a tooth

(17) on the casing (13) which snap-engages in notches (18, 19) in
the base of the insert (12).
A container base as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that said insert (12) comprises an edge (20) which slidingly rests

on the top of the front perimetral wall (21a) of the casing (13).
A container base as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that said mutual engagement means consist of a tooth (23) of the

cup (11) which engages in an undercut (22) in the insert (12), and
a tooth (24) of the cup (11), on the opposite side to the tooth

(23), which engages in an undercut (25) in the rear perimetral 
wall (21b) of the casing (13).
A container base as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that said cup (11) also comprises on its top a perimetral edge

(26) which rests on the top of the rear wall (21b) of the casing
(13).
