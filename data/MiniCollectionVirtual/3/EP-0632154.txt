crimped fibers (B) rounded around a central portion thereof 

as a core (C), the core (C) being formed with a molten-fused 
structure and having the following stipulations: 


(a) a density of the molten-fused structure is not 
less than 75% based on a density of the crimped fibers 

forming the ball-like structures. 
(b) a length of the molten-fused structure is 5 to 50% 
based on a diameter of the ball-like structures, and 
(c) a withdrawing strength of a crimped fiber strand 
connected with the molten-fused structure is not less than 

50% based on a linear strength of the crimped fiber strand

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention related to ball-like structures 
and contacting materials for wastewater-treatment composed 
of the ball-like structures, and more in particular, it 
relates to ball-like structures formed from bundled, 
crimped fibers rounded around a roughly central portion 
thereof as a core. The ball-like structures according to 
the present invention can be used suitably, for example, as 
contacting materials for water-treatment, materials for 
fish culture and filtering materials. Ball-like structures formed from bundled, crimped 
fibers rounded around a roughly central portion thereof as 
a core are known. For instance, Japanese Utility Model 
Publication No. 35278/1989 proposes contacting materials 
for wastewater-treatment, in which crimped fine fiber yarns 
are bundled and bound for gathering up at a roughly central 
portion into a bundle which is then rounded into a 
spherical shape and the bound portion is embedded to the 
inside of the bundle. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) 
No. 202837/1992 proposes a method of producing ball-like 
structures, which comprises binding a bundle composed of a 
plurality of crimped fibers aligned with each substantially  
 
constant interval successively, then cutting the bundle at 
an intermediate portion between the resultant adjacent 
bound portions, and further, applying a heat-treatment to 
the thus obtained fiber bundles in the form of short tufts. The ball-like structures have a large specific surface 
area, since the constituent fibers are entangled in a three 
dimensional manner to each other into a spherical shape. 
Such ball-like structures have an advantageous effect of 
providing favorable settling of microorganisms, deposition 
of sludges to the ball-like structures and enhancing the 
growth of the microorganisms, when the ball-like structures 
are applied to a cleaning-treatment of wastewater due to 
self-cleaning effect of the microorganisms as described in 
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 35278/1989. However, in a case of the ball-like structures as 
described in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 
35278/1989, the core at the central portion (bound portion) 
has a bound structure using synthetic fiber yarns, rigid 
plastic bands or fine metal wires, so that the synthetic 
fibrous yarns or rigid plastic bands incapable of providing 
a firmly bound structure have a drawback that fibers 
constituting the ball-like structures are liable to slip 
off through the bound portion. The foregoing drawback causes
