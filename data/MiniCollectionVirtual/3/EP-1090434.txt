<ABSTRACT>
A filler unit for automatically topping up a battery cell (14) includes a float vessel (16) for containing the liquid to be dispensed and a float valve assembly (34) for establishing a predetermined substantially constant head of liquid in the vessel (16). A baffle plate (40A) in the vessel (16) is spaced sufficiently close to a wall of the vessel (16) to define a capillary passage between the wall and the baffle plate (40A), with at least that surface of the baffle plate (40A) which defines the capillary passage being hydrophilic. In use, the replenishment water is able to flow from the vessel (16) to the cell (14) under gravity along a flowpath until such time as the water level in the cell (14) has risen to a desired level. This creates a pressure equilibrium in the flowpath which causes the flow from the vessel (16) to the cell (14) to cease automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a filler unit for automatically topping up a container
with liquid, and in particular to a battery filler unit for automatically topping up
battery cells with electrolyte in the form of purified water to compensate for
losses due to electrolysis and evaporation.One such battery filler unit consists of a vessel which may be positioned
immediately above a battery cell and supplied with water in a manner which
maintains a constant head in the vessel. An orifice in the bottom of the vessel
communicates with a downpipe which extends downwards from the orifice into
the top portion of the cell. Water flows from the vessel to the cell under gravity
along a flow path defined by the orifice and the downpipe thereby adding to the
electrolyte and causing the level of the electrolyte to rise progressively until the
lower end of the downpipe becomes submerged below the level of the
electrolyte.The orifice forms a continuous air seal by action of surface tension in the water
being dispensed. As the lower end of the downpipe becomes submerged, air in
the downpipe becomes trapped, and a condition is set up for pressure
equilibrium in the flow path causing flow from the vessel to the cell to cease. In one improvement of a battery filler unit a baffle plate is introduced and
spaced close to the bottom of the vessel to form a capillary passage which
operates in tandem with the orifice to improve the quality of the seal at the head
of the downpipe. This improvement forms the subject of US patent 4,544,004.
Resistance to the flow of water under the baffle plate is known to be dependent
on the physical dimensions underneath the baffle plate. Problems can
sometimes arise when these surface characteristics undergo variations sufficient
to interfere with the correct flow of the replenishment water. One method
which has been used to help alleviate the problem has been to vary the
clearance between adjacent faces formed by the bottom of the vessel and the
lower surface of the baffle plate appropriately so as to preserve the requisite
flow rate.An obvious disadvantage of this measure is that the capillarity diminishes with
increased spacing, leading to a corresponding sacrifice in the efficacy of the
airseal with an increase in through flow and uneven filling of the cells of a
multi-celled battery.According to the invention there is provided a filler unit for use in dispensing a
liquid into a container to top up the container to a predetermined desired level,
the container being divided by level sensing

A filler unit (12A) for use in dispensing a liquid into a container (14) to
top up the container (14) to a predetermined desired level (46), the filler

unit (12A) including level sensing means (22) for dividing the container
(14) into a first pressurizable chamber (26) and a second vented

chamber (27), a vessel (16) for containing the liquid to be dispensed,
means (34) for establishing a predetermined substantially constant

head of liquid in the vessel (16), an outlet orifice (38) defined in the wall
(18) of the vessel (16), a baffle (40A) in the vessel (16) spaced

sufficiently close to the wall (18) to define a capillary passage (42)
between the wall (18) and the baffle (40A), wherein the outlet orifice

(38) is arranged to communicate directly with the pressurizable

pressurizable chamber (26) until such time as the liquid level in the
container (14) has risen to the desired level (46) within the lower end of

the pressurizable chamber (26) to trap air therein, thereby to create a
pressure equilibrium in the flowpath (45) which causes the flow from the

vessel (16) to the container (14) to cease automatically.

(38).
A filler unit (12A) according to either one of the preceding claims 1 or 2
