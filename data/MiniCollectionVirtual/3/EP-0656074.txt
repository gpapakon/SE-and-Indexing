<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel target
electrode for use in preventing corrosion in
electrochemical cells. More particularly, the invention
is concerned with the prevention of corrosion in
electrochemical cells at junctures of electrically
conducting pipes to non-electrically conducting pipes as a
result of shunt currents.It is well known that shunt currents exist in
stacks of bipolar plate electrolytic cells with common
electrolytes. These shunt currents are undesirable for at
least two reasons: they can cause corrosion of some of the
components of the system, and they are currents that are
essentially lost in terms of the production of the desired
products of the system. The corrosion problem can be
particularly severe if the shunt currents leave the cells
via conducting nozzles to which there are attached the
inlet and outlet tubes for the cells. It is desirable,
therefore, to be able to reduce the effect of the shunt
currents for all of the inlet and outlet tubes for cells
in stacks.The piping carrying the anolyte or brine to the
stack of the cells is normally a titanium containing metal
which is connected to the stack by a non-conductive
tubing. During normal electrolysis, shunt currents pass
from the individual cells at the positive end of the stack
and enter the tubes. When the tubes are made of a poor
electrical conductor, the current flow that passes in the
tubes is conducted by ions. This current is also called
the bypass current. The current operates by a cathodic
electrolysis reaction such as:
2 H2O + 2e- → H2 + 2OH- E = -0.2VAt the negative end, the current leaves the piping
by an anodic electrolysis reaction, such as:
2 Cl- → Cl2 + 2e- E = +1.3VThe current then flows from the housing at the
positive end into the non-conductive tubes and returns to
the cells at the negative of the cell stacks. The current
flow in the non- conductive tubes is again conducted by
ions and in order for the current to enter the metal
structure at the negative end of the cell stack, a
reduction reaction such as reaction (1) must again occur. Because of these shunt currents, titanium may be
dissolved by an anodic reaction such as:
Ti + 4 Cl- → Ti Cl4 + 4e- E = +0.4Merely grounding the titanium piping as proposed by
the prior art does not solve the problem of protecting the
titanium against corrosion as a result of the shunt
currents since they still exist and corrosion can still
occur at those points where the current flows. TiH+ forms
as a result of penetration of atomic hydrogen into
titanium and
