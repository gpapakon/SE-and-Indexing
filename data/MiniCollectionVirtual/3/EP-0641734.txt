<ABSTRACT>
To provide a splicer which can form a spliced yarn portion 
having a fixed strength by yarn splicing of yarn ends after 

being drawn. 
The splicer (1) includes a mechanism for drawing two yarn end 
portions, a mechanism for cutting the two drawn portions of 

the yarns to a predetermined length, a mechanism for 
arranging the yarn ends (Ya, Yb) of the predetermined length 

and guiding them into a yarn splicing member (3) having a 
yarn splicing chamber (17) for entangling both ends of the 

yarns by air flows.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates principally to a yarn splicing 
apparatus for splicing supply yarns when a spent yarn supply 
package or bobbin is exchanged for a new one in a drawing and 
false twisting machine such as a draw-texturizing machine. In a conventional drawing and false twisting machine a 
running filament yarn unwound and supplied from a yarn supply 
package is drawn or stretched in a heated condition and false 
twisted, and then taken up onto a take-up package by way of 
the steps of heat setting, oiling and so forth. In order to secure a sufficient yarn supplying capacity, 
taking a balance of operation of the machine with that of 
automatic doffing by an automatic doffer into consideration, 
a plurality of yarn supply packages are mounted on a creel 
stand, and the last end of a yarn of a yarn supply package 
from which the yarn is being released is spliced in advance 
to the beginning end of a spare yarn supply package so that 
the yarn may be released from the packages successively. If the yarn splicing of the yarns is performed while the 
yarns remain as non-drawn yarns, then the spliced portion 
produces a yarn defect after the yarns have been processed in 
the drawing and false twisting operation, and accordingly it 
is necessary to draw each beginning end to be spliced in 
advance and then to splice such drawn yarn ends to each other 
by means of a yarn splicing apparatus. In this instance, 
since it is not only inefficient but also likely to cause 
unevenness of the extent of drawing to perform the drawing of 
each beginning end manually, various devices for performing 
such drawing mechanically have been investigated. However, 
they have disadvantages in that defects of yarn joints such 
as abnormal thickness or insufficient strength appear or that 
the operation is not satisfactory.  In view of the disadvantages of prior art such as mentioned 
above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a 
yarn splicing apparatus of improved operation for performing 
yarn splicing to produce yarn joints of sufficient strength. According to the present invention, this object is achieved 
by the subject matter of the patent claims. A yarn splicing apparatus, hereunder also referred to as a 
splicer, of the present invention includes a mechanism for 
drawing or stretching two yarn end portions and a mechanism 
for guiding the two drawn ends into a splicing chamber of a 
yarn splicing member and positioning the yarn ends for 
entanglement of both yarns ends by means of air flows. The 
splicer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A yarn splicing apparatus, including a mechanism for 
drawing two yarn end portions to be spliced, a mechanism for 

arranging the two drawn yarn ends in order and guiding them 
into a yarn splicing member (3; 111), with a yarn splicing 

chamber (17; 157) for forming entanglements at both end 
portions of the yarns by air flows. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein a mechanism 
for cutting the two drawn portions of the yarn ends to a 

predetermined length, said two yarn ends of the predetermined 
lenght being arranged in order in the opposite directions and 

being guided into the yarn splicing member (3; 111). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein a pair of 
first clamps (4, 5), a pair of yarn cutters (6, 7), a pair of 

yarn drawing and pulling levers (10, 11), and a pair of 
second clamps (12, 13) are disposed in order across and on 

the opposite ends of the yarn splicing member (3, 111) in the 
inside of which whirling air flows can be produced. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein drawing means 
which act upon clamped yarn end portions to draw the yarn 

ends serve also as yarn pulling means for drawing near the 
cut yarn ends in the drawn condition and placing the cut yarn 

ends one on the other in said yarn splicing member (3, 111). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein ends of two 
yarns to be spliced to each other are introduced into said 

yarn splicing member (3); while extremity sides of the yarn 
ends are grasped at two locations of said first clamps (4, 5) 

 
and said second clamps (12, 13), the yarns thus grasped are 

pressed are drawn by said yarn drawing and pulling levers 
(10, 11); the yarns at the thus drawn portions are cut to a 

predetermined length by said yarn cutters (6, 7); said first 
clamps (4, 5) on the opposite ends of said yarn splicing 

member (3) are opened; the yarns are pressed and pulled by 
said yarn drawing and pulling levers (10, 11) to position the 

cut drawn yarn ends in an overlapping relationship within the 
yarn splicing chamber (17); and then whirling air flows are 

produced in the yarn splicing chamber (17) to entangle and 
integrate fibers or filaments of the drawn yarn ends with one 

another and twist the drawn yarn ends to splice the yarns to 
each other. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, including a mechanism 
for fixing two yarn end portions by means of a first lever 

(105) and a pair of clamps (109, 110) and rocking said first 
lever (105) to draw the two yarn end portions, a pair of 

cutters (106, 107) for cutting the two yarn ends at the drawn 
portions to a predetermined length, a mechanism for arranging 

both ends of the predetermined length of the two yarns after 
being cut in order in the opposite directions by rocking 

motion of a pair of second levers (112, 113) while both ends 
are free and drawing the yarn ends into a cylindrical chamber 

(157) of a yarn splicing member, and said yarn splicing 
member (111) for jetting air flows into said cylindrical 

chamber (157) in response to a change-over signal of a valve 
switch (172) to sufficiently open filaments of the free yarn 

ends after being drawn and form entanglements to splice the 
yarn to each other, and said mechanism for fixing, said 

cutters (6, 7), said mechanism for arranging, and said 
splic
ing member (111) are successively operated by a 
mechanism having a plurality of cams driven by a pneumatic 

 
cylinder (103) which is one of driving means in accordance 

with the necessity. 
A yarn splicing method including steps of drawing two yarn 
end portions to be spliced, cutting the two drawn portions of 

the yarn ends to a predetermined length, arranging the two 
drawn yarn ends in order, guiding the yarn ends into a yarn 

splicing member, and forming entanglements at both ends of 
the yarns by air flow, characterized in that, when a drawn 

yarn end is cut to a predetermined length, the drawn yarn end 
portion is cut in a rather loosened condition.
