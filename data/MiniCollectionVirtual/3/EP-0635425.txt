<ABSTRACT>
The fixtures in which curved and reinforced flat 
plates (72,74,76) are held while being welded, cleaned, 

coated and cured include fixedly mounted exterior towers 
(94) and interior towers (82) removably mounted on rollable 

bogies (52) (i.e., rail cars or carriages) for ease of 
transport through a succession of work stations. 

Subcomponents (78,98,138) fabricated on respective bogies 
(52) are weldingly joined to form module subassemblies 

after coupling and manoeuvring the respective bogies (52) 
to align the subcomponents (i.e., units). A transverse 

bulkhead (156) is supported on fluid cushion pallets beside 
the bogie-supporting rails (32), so that the transverse 

bulkhead can be positioned for welding of each subassembly 
thereto, to provide each respective double-walled vessel 

hull midbody module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for fabricating a subcomponent for use in making 
a double-walled vessel hull. The US patent of Cuneo et al. 5,085,161, issued 
February 4, 1992, discloses a method and an apparatus for 
fabricating from steel plate subassemblies which are joined 
to one another and to transverse bulkheads to provide 
modules which are then serially joined to provide a 
longitudinal midbody for a double-walled tanker hull. Bow 
and stern sections are added to complete the hull. 
According to the method disclosed in this prior patent, 
much of the fabrication of the subassemblies is conducted 
using a set of towers which hold and position the various 
curved plates of the inner and outer hulls, and the wall-connecting 
plates, all arranged on end, as electrogas or 
electroslag welders vertically create T-joints among the 
respective sets of three juxtaposed plate edges. The U.S. patent of Goldbach et al. 
5,090,351, issued February 25, 1992, discloses 
certain improvements, e.g., for bending the curved 
plates, and welding, cleaning, painting and 
assembling the various elements of the modules and 
for serially joining the modules to provide the 
longitudinal midbodies. The U.S. patent of Goldbach et al. 
5,086,723, issued February 11, 1992, discloses an 
elaborated double-hulled vessel, in which each 
midbody module further includes a double-walled 
longitudinal bulkhead which can be fabricated as a 
subassembly using the methods and apparatus 
disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patents of 
Cuneo et al. 5,085,161 and Goldbach et al. 
5,090,351. An improved form of the longitudinal  
 
bulkhead (and other subassemblies of the double-walled 
vessel hull), which provides longitudinally 
staggered cell-to-cell access openings through the 
longitudinal wall layer-connecting plates is 
disclosed in EP-A-0590920 published 6 April 1994. According to a further development that is 
disclosed in EP-A-0550992 published 14 July 1993 (and 
in corresponding United States Patent No. 5,269,246 
of Goldbach et al. issued December 14, 1993) 
the newly fabricated modules are turned from 
their initially upended orientation to an upright 
orientation using a two-section floating drydock. 
One section is equipped with the module-rotating 
device. The two drydock sections can be 
independently flooded and pumped out for acquiring 
modules and shifting the growing midbody so as to 
spatially position the site where two modules are to 
be joined so that it is effectively between the
