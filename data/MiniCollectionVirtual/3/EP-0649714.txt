<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming concrete retaining wall blocks 
from a single mold (12) with selectable dimensions such that a 

retaining wall of a desired setback can be defined. One of 
a plurality of core bars (20) is implemented with the mold (12) 

during the manufacturing process to define a laterally 
extending recess of a same width (W) across the lower major 

surface of a composite block (40). Subsequently, the composite 
block (40) is split along a midsection thereof to form a pair of 

identical blocks, each block having a laterally extending 
front lip (34) and a laterally extending lower recess (48). The 

depth of the recess (W/2) corresponds to the setback of a 
retaining wall formed therefrom. The shallower the lower 

recess, the greater the setback of the retaining wall 
formed therefrom. Further, the present method facilitates 

creating a pair of blocks (40) with a textured front surface to 
provide an aesthetically pleasant retaining wall. A 

plurality of core bars (28) are available with different widths (W), 
and are used to form retaining wall blocks adapted to 

define retaining walls with setbacks from 0° to 12°. The 
core bars (20) can have a rectangular or trapezoidal cross 

section. Each formed retaining wall block has core 
openings (36) to reduce the weight thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related generally to the
construction of retaining wall blocks, and more
particularly to a unique method of forming a pair of
identical blocks each with a raised front lip and a lower
front recess, the depth of which lower recess can be
selectively defined during the manufacturing process to
correspond to the setback angle of a retaining wall which
can be constructed from the block.Retaining walls are commonly employed to retain highly
positioned soil, such as soil forming a hill, to provide a
usable level surface therebelow such as for playgrounds and
yards, or to provide artificial contouring of the landscape
which is aesthetically pleasant. Retaining wall systems
are typically designed to have a "setback" at an angle to
counter the pressure of the soil disposed behind the wall.
Setback is generally considered to be the distance in which
one course of a wall extends beyond the front of the next
highest course of the same wall. However, setback is not
always required for a wall of moderate height, and further,
may not be appropriate when constructed close to lot lines,
utilities, trees, or structures already in place. Thus, a
method of manufacturing retaining wall blocks which
accommodates selectively creating blocks of different
dimensions such that the blocks can be used to form
retaining walls with setbacks from 0° to 12° would be
valuable to accommodate the needs of various applications.It is known in the prior art to form blocks in pairs,
whereupon a composite block is split to form a pair of
substantially identical blocks to economize the production
of the blocks. Further, splitting a composite block allows
the formation of an irregular and aesthetically pleasant
textured front surface for each of the blocks defined.
Thus, splitting a molded composite block has the dual 
function of facilitating an economical method of producing
multiple blocks from a single mold, and which blocks have
an aesthetically pleasant exposed front surface.U.S.-A-4,909,010 which is -assigned to the
assignee of the present invention discloses a novel block
having a textured front surface, and which is ideal for
constructing retaining wall systems with a setback. The
blocks interlock to create a strong barrier wall. The
setback is determined by the thickness of the front lip.
The blocks are formed in pairs by splitting a single molded
block. There is no lower channel defined in the molded
block, thus, a wall cannot be built with no setback. There
is also no method disclosed of using a single mold to
defin

A method of creating a construction block [40] adapted

to form retaining walls or the like, comprising the steps
of:


(a) forming a member [10] having a major upper

surface [22] and major lower surface [24]
 and a plurality of edges,
said upper major surface [22]
 having a ridge [30] extending laterally

across a midsection thereof between opposing said edges,
said lower major surface [24]
 having a notch [28] extending laterally

across a midsection thereof between opposing said edges,
wherein said laterally extending ridge [30]
 is parallel to and
disposed vertically above said laterally extending notch [28]
;
and
(b) splitting said member along a center [42] of both

said ridge and said notch to define a pair of said
construction blocks [40]
, wherein each said construction block
has rough textured front surface [46]
 defined by splitting the
member in half, a recess [48]
 extending laterally thereunder,
and a lip [34]
 extending laterally thereover
characterised in that when the blocks [40]
 are stacked after splitting,
the lip [34]
 and recess [48], both lip (34) and recess (48) being

directly adjacent the splitting plane, conform and abut one
another.
The method as specified in Claim 1 further
comprising the step of selectively defining the width of

said laterally extending notch [28] to correspond to a selected

wall setback defined when said blocks [40] are stacked with the

lip [34] of a lower said block disposed in the recess [48]
 of a said
block stacked thereupon.
The method as specified in Claim 2 wherein said
laterally extending ridge [30]
 is defined with a width equal to
the width of the defined notch [28]
