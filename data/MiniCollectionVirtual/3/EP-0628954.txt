<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc (2) has a recording surface on which a 
spiral track having a predetermined track pitch is formed. A 

plurality of information units are formed on the track each of 
which has a predetermined unit length in a circumferential 

direction and a radial direction of the optical disc 
respectively. The information is converted in a shape and a 

disposed position of an information pit, which is formed in 
each of the plurality of information units. A method of 

reproducing the information includes the steps of: irradiating 
a reading light to form a light spot on the information pit; 

detecting an outer light portion, which corresponds to an outer 
circumferential side domain, among a reflective light shaped 

in a spot from the information pit, which is projected on an 
imaginary plane including a light receiving surface of a light 

detecting apparatus (30) to output a light detection signal 
indicating the detected outer light portion; and reproducing 

the information on the basis of the light detection signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related with an optical disc,
an apparatus for reproducing the optical disc and a method of
recording and reproducing the optical disc.As shown in FIG. 22, recording music information and
image information onto an optical disc 92, is performed by
converting it into a signal which has a parameter of pit length
of an information pit 91 on an information recording surface
95. An apparatus for reproducing the music information and the
image information from this optical disc 92, irradiates a laser
light to the information pit 91 so that it may become a light
beam spot LS having a predetermined diameter. And, it detects
the diffracted and reflected light by a light detecting
apparatus, which consists of a photodiode etc., outputs it as
an electric signal, and extracts and outputs the recorded music
information and the recorded image information from this
electric signal, by giving signal conversion contrary to that
at the time of recording.There are a compact disc (CD), a laser vision disc 
(LVD), etc. as an optical disc used in this manner. In FIG. 22,
a reference numeral 93 indicates a substrate which consists of
polycarbonate resin etc., and a reference numeral 94 indicates
a protection layer.The information recording density of such an optical
disc, is greatly influenced by an interval of the tracks, which
are the center lines of the pit arrays of the information pits
91 shown in FIG. 23 i.e. the value of the track pitch P1 (= 1.6
µm : micrometers), and the value of the diameter of the light
beam spot LS of the laser light irradiated onto the information
pit 91 (= 2.1 µm). Therefore, in order to record more
information on a disc, it may be considered to narrow the value
of the track pitch from the presently available value.However, although there arises no problem in examples
shown in FIG. 22 and FIG. 23, for example, if a track pitch is
set to a value P2 less than the conventional value P1 (for
example, P2 = P1 / 2) as shown in FIG. 24, information pits 91B
and 91C etc. of neighboring tracks are included within the
range of the beam spot LS of the laser light other than the
information pit 91A which should be read. Therefore, under
this condition, a crosstalk amount increases and it cannot be
practically used.On the other hand, it may be also considered to further
reduce the diameter of the beam spot LS of the laser light. As
shown in FIG. 25, a minimum beam diameter w at the time of
condensing a laser light having a wavelength λ at the position 
of a focal length f by an
