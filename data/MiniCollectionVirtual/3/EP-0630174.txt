<ABSTRACT>
Packaging for an electronics assembly. A base card (200) 
has a row of elongated slots (221). A number of individually 

insertable subassemblies (300) have standoff feet and a pair of 
offset hooks at their sides. The hooks snap into the slots in 

such a way that each slot can hold the hooks for four different 
subassemblies, which are positioned adjacent each other and on 

both sides of the base card.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the physical packaging of 
electronic circuits and similar items, and more particularly 
concerns a system for mounting multiple subassemblies at high 
density on a single base card. Such a system is known from DE-A-4 104 984. Electronic and optoelectronic circuits seem to decrease in 
physical size almost without limit. This usually does not 
result in a decrease in the size of the overall system, but 
rather the inclusion of ever increasing numbers of circuits 
within a single system. In many systems, such as switching 
systems, communications systems, and the like, the demand is to 
package larger numbers of a common subassembly within the same 
frame. For example, a system for interconnecting multiple 
optical fibers may require dozens of "link cards" which each 
convert a serial optical signal at gigabit frequencies into a 
parallel electrical signal and vice versa. In such systems, 
the high signal frequencies also make small physical size and 
dense packaging very desirable. Previous advances in electronics packaging at the card or 
subassembly level have required large spacing between adjacent 
subassemblies for insertion and removal, have been difficult to 
insert and remove, have been fragile or expensive, or have 
interfered with heat dissipation from the system. The present invention focuses upon increasing packaging 
density by decreasing the allowable spacing between  
 
subassemblies according to claims 1 to 9 mounted on a common base 
card, while preserving ease of inserting and removing the 
individual subassemblies; in fact, no tools are required for 
either insertion or removal. The packaging is inexpensive, 
rugged, easily manufactured, simple to operate, and does not 
interfere with heat dissipation, the other major problem of high 
packaging density. In a system or overall assembly according to claims 10 and 11, a 
base card has a row of elongated slots. A number of individually 
insertable subassemblies have standoff feet and a pair of offset 
hooks at their sides. The hooks snap into the slots in such a 
way that each slot can hold the hooks for four different 
subassemblies, which are positioned adjacent each other and on 
both sides of the base card. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a base card and a number of 
subassemblies according to an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the top of a subassembly shown in 
Fig. 1. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the bottom of the subassembly 
shown in Fig. 2. FIG. 4 is a perspective

<CLAIMS>
An electronics subassembly for mounting on a base card (200) 
positioned in a base plane (201) and having at least one row 

(220) of elongated slots each having an axis in a first 
direction (202), said slots being spaced across said base 

card in a second direction (201), and having a plurality of 
electrical base card connectors (211) mounted thereon, said 

subassembly comprising: 

a circuit card (310) positioned in a plane parallel to said 
base plane, 
a connector (315) for mating with one of said base-card 
connectors, 
a pair of substantially straight side edges (321) extending 
in a direction transverse to said second direction, 
at least two spaced-apart feet (323) projecting from said 
subassembly and having a length sufficient to rest on said 

base, 
at least two spaced-apart hooks (326) projecting from 
respective ones of said side edges of said subassembly, each 

of said hooks having a shape for engaging a different one of 
said slots so as to cause said feet to exert pressure upon 

said base card, and each of said hooks being located at a 
different position along its respective side edge, so that 

each of said hooks engages its respective slot at a location 
along said respective slot such that adjacent hooks of two 

different ones of said subassemblies engage the same slot at 
different locations along the axis of said same slot. 
A subassembly according to claim 1, wherein said subassembly 
includes a circuit card (310) and frame means (320) at least  

 
partially surrounding said card in the plane of said card. 
A subassembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said base 
card includes a row of locating means (231), and wherein 

said feet have corresponding subassembly locating means 
(325) fitting into said locating means on said base card. 
A subassembly according to claim 3, wherein said subassembly 
has four corners, and has one of said feet at each of said 

corners. 
A subassembly according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein 
said hooks are bevelled sufficiently for releasing said 

subassembly from said base card by upward pressure on said 
subassembly. 
A subassembly according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
said subassembly further includes a bail (341) for camming 

said subassembly away from said base. 
A subassembly according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, wherein 
said subassembly further includes socket means (331, 332) at 

one end thereof, for connecting cables parallel to said 
circuit-card plane. 
A subassembly according to claim 7, wherein said socket 
means accepts optical cables (111 to 117). 
A subassembly according to claim 7 or 8 which further 
includes an optical source (317) and optical detector (316), 

mounted in said socket means. 
An electronics assembly, comprising: 

at least one base card (200) positioned in a base plane 
(201) and having at least one row (220) of elongated slots  

 
(221, 223) each having an axis in a first direction (202), 

said slots being spaced across said base card in a second 
direction (201) and having a plurality of electrical base 

card connectors (211) mounted thereon; and 
a plurality of subassemblies (300) according to anyone of 
claims 1 to 8 removably mounted on each base card, each said 

subassembly being positioned in a plane parallel to said 
base card. 
An assembly according to claim 10, wherein said base card 
has upper and lower sides, each having a plurality of said 

electrical base card connectors, and wherein said plurality 
of subassemblies are mounted on both sides of said base card 

in said one row of said slots.
