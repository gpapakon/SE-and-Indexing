<ABSTRACT>
In a noise signal filter (5) of a noise level detector (3), the noise signals (Sr) to be determined in an information signal (Sn) transmitted in a transmission channel (1) are filtered out and, for obtaining noise signal components which directly exhibit a system reference line as base, are supplied to an envelope demodulator (8) via a rectifier (6) and an amplitude limiter (9). This demodulator generates from the input signal an envelope with locations at which the amplitudes of the noise signal alone determine the level of the envelope. The level of these locations is stored by a minimum-level store (11) which tracks the input signal and which in each case stores the previously lowest level value. To compensate for a drift in the signal guiding the minimum-level store (11), a second minimum-level store (13) is provided which stores the previously lowest minimum value of the output signal of the amplitude limiter and forwards it to a signal subtracting circuit (16) for compensating for the drift and for eliminating voltage differences during the tracking in the minimum-level stores.

An arrangement (3) for measuring the level (pr) of a 
noise signal (Sr) which is superimposed upon a useful 

signal (Sn), in particular an audio-, video- or data 
signal, and for generating a noise detector signal (Sg) 

corresponding to this level (pr), wherein the arrangement 
(3) comprises a noise signal filter (5) which transmits the 

noise signal (Sr) and differentiates the useful signal 
(Sn), characterised by 


a rectifier (6) for rectifying the signal components 
of the noise signal (Sn) and the noise signal (Sr) 

transmitted by the noise signal filter (5) 
an envelope curve demodulator (8) for generating an 
envelope curve signal (Sf) from the rectified signal 

components of the useful signal (Sn) and the noise 
signal (Sr) and 
a minimal level store (11) which controls the envelope 
curve signal (Sf) in such manner that the level value 

of the previously lowest level of the envelope curve

element with a large storage time constant. 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in

An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised by 
an amplitude limiter (9), arranged downstream of the

An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the noise signal filter (5) comprises a signal delay

An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the minimal level store (11, 13) comprises a storage 

capacitor (34), which is charged via a charging resistor 
(35) with a large storage time constant (Tsp), and a 

controllable discharge path (36) which is controlled by the 
envelope curve signal and has an adjustment time constant 

which is smaller than the time constant (Thk) of the 
envelope curve demodulator (8). 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that in a further circuit branch (28) corresponding to the 

envelope curve demodulator (8) and the minimal level store 
(11), a further circuit branch (29) consisting of an 

envelope curve demodulator (12) and a minimal level store

envelope curve demodulator (8) and at its output to one 
signal input (15) of a further signal subtracter (16) whose 

other signal input (14) is connected to the output of the 
first-mentioned minimal level store (11).  

 
An arrangement according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the two circuit branches (28, 29) formed between the 

signal input of the envelope curve demodulator (8) and the 
signal inputs (14, 15) of the second signal subtracter (16)

set and the set value of the signal parameters are 

dependent upon the noise detector signal (Sg).
