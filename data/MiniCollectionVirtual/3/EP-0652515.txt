<ABSTRACT>
A memory device (1) comprises a plurality of memory blocks (4, 6, 8, 
10) formed in a common substrate (30) and a memory manager (2). The 

memory manager (2) tests the memory blocks to identify working pages 
of memory and stores the addresses of the working pages in a further 

memory (46). Access to the working pages is then controlled by the 
memory manager (2) so as to simulate a contiguous area of memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory device, the manufacture of 
such a device and a method of simulating a contiguous memory. A semiconductor wafer may carry a plurality of memory modules. If the 
modules are connected to a common power supply rail, a short circuit 
within a module can cause the entire wafer to become unusable. Integrated circuit manufacturing techniques for devices, such as 
semiconductor memories, tend to provide yields of about 20% to 40%, 
the remaining devices being either totally or partially defective. 
However, effective yields could be increased if partially defective devices 
could also be used. EP 0 541 288 A discloses an arrangement in which a plurality of devices 
arranged in modules is fabricated on a wafer. A set of discretionary 
connections are associated with each of the modules and with 
interconnect/power segments associated with respective ones of the 
modules. Connections are made or broken in a multilayer structure of 
the substrate after a module has been tested. Thus the connections are 
made by the manufacturer of the wafer. Such an arrangement has little 
or no scope for subsequent reworking of the connections. US 4 703 436 discloses an arrangement in which a plurality of devices is 
formed in a matrix in a wafer. Each device is tested and thereafter a 
conductive grid is formed on the wafer to interconnect all the functional 
and partially functional circuits of the wafer. Each matrix row includes  
 
redundant decoder lines which are programmed to reassign functional 
circuits from a semiconductor wafer substrate location to a matrix row 
location in another matrix having defective circuits. Thus complete 
functional matrix rows may be formed. Associated input and output 
lines are similarly assigned. The assignment has to be done during the 
manufacture of the device. Also the device cannot be further updated to 
take account of further faults occurring after manufacture. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a 
memory device, comprising a plurality of memory blocks and a memory 
manager arranged to test the memory blocks to identify working pages of 
memory within the memory blocks, to store addresses of the working 
pages within a further memory and to control access to the working 
pages in accordance with the addresses stored in the further memory so 
as to simulate a contiguous area of memory. Thus fully functional and partially functional blocks of memory can be 
combined together to simulate a fully functioning
