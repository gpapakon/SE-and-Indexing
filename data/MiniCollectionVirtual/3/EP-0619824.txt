<DESCRIPTION>
 TROPHOBLAST INTERFERONS AND THEIR USEThe present invention relates to trophoblast interferon proteins, their preparation, and their use, as well as antibodies against the interferon proteins.The invention is based on the discovery that human tropho- blasts produce proteins which conform with the internatio¬ nally accepted characterizations of interferons, but which show properties indicating that they are not identical with known interferons, and on the isolation and characteriza- tion of the trophoblast-produced interferons. Thus, the interferon proteins are human interferon proteins/glycopro- teins produced by human trophoblasts, or the same or sub¬ stantially the same proteins when produced by other means, such as by recombinant techniques. The invention relates to these proteins when existing outside their natural environ¬ ment, in other words in non-naturally occurring forms, e.g. as homogeneous proteins, or in purified or pure or sub¬ stantially pure form, such as disclosed herein. The inven¬ tion also provides methods for producing these novel pro- teins by cell cultivation and protein purification, in¬ cluding methods for production in a scale which makes it possible to use the interferon proteins for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of humans and other warm-blooded animals, and in a scale which is realistic for the estab- lishment of the amino acid sequence of the interferon proteins as well as the sequence of DNA coding for the proteins.As described in the following, substantially pure human trophoblast interferon proteins/glycoproteins have been isolated by two-dimensional high performance liquid chroma- tography and other methods suitable for production in quan¬ tities sufficient for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of humans or other warm blooded animals. 

 The properties of the interferon proteins combined with the fact that present development makes it possible to produce them in large quantities will make it possible to use them, e.g., in the following applications:- Prevention of virus, in particular human immunodefi- ciency virus and herpes simplex virus, from infected mother to noninfected fetus during pregnancy- and during labour,- treatment of virus and non-virus infections of the placenta, such as treatment of the fetal membranes, treatment via the amnion fluid, and treatment of the fetus in cases where acute systemic maternal infec¬ tions are diagnosed,- treatment of benign and malignant tumors (choriocarci- nomas) arising from the placenta,- identification of the
