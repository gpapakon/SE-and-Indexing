<ABSTRACT>
A method for prolonged delivery of a therapeutic agent to the eye is disclosed. The method provides for the addition of a desired drug to a suitable, preferably non-aqueous, carrier. An amount of the carrier containing the therapeutic dose of the drug is placed on the skin exterior to the ocular surface near the lateral and lower lid margins. Movements of the orbicularis oculi associated with the scissor-like closing of the lids of the eye continuously transport small portions of the therapeutic agent and carrier into the interpalpebral space where the drug is released to the corneal surface. Further provided is a calcium-based ophthalmic composition which is particularly effective in treating dry eye syndrome and which is optimally delivered by the method just described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to compositions for use in the treatment of
dry eye syndrome.Dohlman. 1971. Trans. Ophthal. Soc. U.K. 91:105.Huth et al. 1981. Arch. Ophthal. 99:1628.Lamberts. 1980. International Opthalmology

Clinics. 13:231.Treatment of diseases of the human eye is often
accomplished through the topical administration of therapeutic
agents. Any topical method of drug delivery must take into
account and attempt to overcome many inherent physiological
systems that operate to protect and maintain the vital front 
surfaces of the eye. For example, the cornea and conjunctiva
are coated with mucin and bathed in a complex aqueous fluid
derived mainly from the lacrimal glands. The region between
the lids of the normal eye -- the interpalpebral space -- is
covered by the preocular tear film, a very thin (generally less
than 40ÂµM) liquid layer covering the cornea and conjunctiva.
The preocular tear film is provided on its anterior surface with a
thin film of lipids derived from the Meibomian glands that open
along the lid margin. Because the tear film is dynamic and
subject contamination, the tear film is continually replaced, the
effete tear residues being forced from the eye through the pair
of puncta and associated canaliculi at the medial corner of the
eye by blinking.In order to have therapeutic effect, a drug or other
compound must generally pass into the eye through the cornea.
Problematic to topical delivery of drugs is in fact that the cornea
is less permeable that the conjunctiva. Further, the surface area
of the conjunctiva is highly vascularized, and in surface area is
some 14 times greater than the surface area of the cornea. For
these reasons, the transconjunctival loss of instilled drugs is
considerable. Further, water soluble drugs are quickly
eliminated from the eye surface through tear outflow, a process
that is often accelerated in the diseased eye, and topical
delivery of drugs to the eye in sufficient quantity and for
sufficient periods is often difficult. Thus, the effectiveness of
prior art methods of topical drug application is often limited.The most common known topical delivery of ophthalmic
drugs is accomplished using water-based compositions, either
as a solution or a suspension. Such compositions are generally
delivered as drops or as a wash

<CLAIMS>
A calcium-based ophthalmic composition for treatment
of dry eye syndrome, comprising:


a)an ophthalmologically acceptable hydrophobic carrier
and
b)dispersed within said carrier, a minimally water-soluble
ophthalmologically acceptable salt of calcium.
A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
calcium salt is selected from the group consisting of

calcium carbonate, calcium tartrate, calcium magnesium
carbonate, calcium metasilicate, calcium sulphate, calcium

malate and secondary calcium orthophosphate.
A composition as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2
wherein said calcium salt is finely divided into particles

having a mean diameter of less than 60 microns.
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the carrier has sufficient viscosity to prevent

running or dripping of the carrier when the carrier is
applied to a more or less vertically orientated surface.
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the carrier is petrolatum-based.
A composition as claimed in claim 5 wherein the
petrolatum-based carrier comprises petrolatum and white

wax.
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6
which further comprises a polyol.
A composition as claimed in claim 7 wherein the polyol
is glycerol or propylene glycol. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8
wherein said ophthalmologically acceptable salt is calcium

carbonate.
A composition as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9
wherein said ophthalmologically acceptable calcium salt is

present in an amount of between 2% and 25% by weight.
A composition as claimed in claim 10 wherein said
ophthalmologically calcium salt is present in an amount of

10% by weight.
A composition according to any one of claims 4 to 11
wherein the more or less vertically orientated surface is a

lateral or inferior lid margin exterior to an ocular
surface.
Use of an ophthalmologically acceptable carrier having
sufficient viscosity to prevent running or dripping of the

carrier when the carrier is applied to a more or less
vertically orientated surface, and , dispersed within said

ophthalmologically acceptable carrier, a minimally water
soluble ophthalmologically acceptable salt of calcium

selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate,
calcium tartrate, calcium magnesium carbonate, calcium

metasillicate, calcium sulphate, calcium malate and
secondary calcium orthophosphate, said calcium salt being

finely divided into particles having a mean diameter of
less than 60 microns, in the manufacture of a medicament

for the treatment of a human ophthalmic disease.
