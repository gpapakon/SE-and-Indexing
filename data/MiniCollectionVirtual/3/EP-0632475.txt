<ABSTRACT>
A multi-directional switch (1) comprises a joy stick (6) which is inclined for 
selective operation of a plurality of switch portions. The joy stick (6) includes a 

support potion (6a) supported pivotally about the bottom end thereof; a slidable 
contact spherical portion (6b) bulging from the top end of the support portion (6a) 

and having a spherical surface (6e) slidably abutting throughout the circumference 
thereof against the inner peripheral surface of a through hole (5a) when pivoted; 

and an operating portion (6c) projecting through the through hole (5a) adjacent the 
spherical surface (6e). The outer periphery of a flat surface (6d) of the slidable 

contact spherical portion (6b) of the joy stick (6) is supported at four 
circumferentially spaced positions so that the joy stick (6) is returned to a neutral 

position by the elastic restoring force of the switch portions. A joy stick support 
structure for the multi-directional switch (1) requires neither a particularly part for 

returning the joy stick (6) to the neutral position nor a securely determined fulcrum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joy stick support structure for a multi-directional 
switch for selectively controlling a plurality of switch portions. This type of multi-directional switch is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model 
Application Laid-Open No. 57-128731 (1982) and Japanese Utility Model 
Application Laid-Open No. 1-111431 (1989), for example. The prior art multi-directional 
switch includes four switch portions formed on a printed wiring board 
or the like, a joy stick supported pivotally about a pivot fulcrum located centrally 
of the four switch portions, and a spring element such as a coil spring and a plate 
spring for returning the joy stick to its neutral position. An operating portion of the 
joy stick which projects from a through hole of a panel is inclined against the 
elastic force of the spring element, to incline the joy stick. One of the switch 
portions is selectively turned into the on position by the joy stick, depending on the 
direction of the inclination. When the operating force exerted upon the joy stick 
is released, the elastic force accumulated in the spring element forces the joy stick 
to return to the neutral position, and the one switch portion is returned to the off 
position by the restoring force thereof. The above-mentioned prior art multi-directional switch structure, however, 
is of the type wherein the joy stick is returned to the neutral position by the spring  
 
element such as a coil spring and a plate spring. In this structure, it is necessary 
to securely determine the pivot fulcrum of the joy stick so that the joy stick is 
returned to the neutral position spaced from the switch portions, resulting in an 
increased number of parts and deterioration in productivity. Further, an additional spring element such as a coil spring and a plate spring 
is required to return the joy stick to the neutral position, which results in an 
increased number of parts and the increased total size of the structure.  
 US-A-4408103 discloses a joy stick support structure according to the preambles of claims 1 and 8, 
having a plurality of contact regions and corresponding 
conductive regions mounted on a piece of resilient material 
resting on the surface, with each conductive region 
contained within a hollowed portion of the resilient 
material to be thereby spaced apart from the respective 
contact region, and having a swivelingly mounted joystick.  
 The present invention is intended for a joy stick support structure for a multi-directional 
switch, the
