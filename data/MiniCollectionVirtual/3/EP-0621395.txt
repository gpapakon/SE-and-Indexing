<ABSTRACT>
A supporting structure (1) lies in an opening, in a 
floating vessel (9), to which is connected a group of risers 

(3) running from the sea bottom to the sea surface, linking 
undersea oil wells to their respective production trees (5) 

on the floating vessel (9). The supporting structure (1) is 
provided with means that enable a group of risers (3) to 

articulate in relation to the supporting structure (1), and 
means to enable said supporting structure to be connected/articulated 

to the floating vessel (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
Ever since oilfields have been discovered in deep 
waters (deeper than 800 meters) considerable effort has been 
made to find ways of working them cheaply and easily. Among the many possibilities suggested, that of using 
semi-submersible platforms and risers linking undersea wells 
to Xmas trees lying afloat has proved to be quite suitable 
for dealing with the flow of oil from such undersea wells. 
Such risers have however to undergo great strain and twisting 
caused by environmental forces (waves, wind and ocean 
currents), as does the platform. All of these strains may 
lead to (i) breaking of such risers, (ii) serious setbacks to 
production and (iii) threats to the environment, and they 
call for heavy capital expenditure since sturdier equipment 
is needed. This invention concerns a system for tightening the 
risers used with floating production platforms operating in 
deep water. It is a system that ensures that an almost 
constant tension is applied to the top of the risers while at 
the same time compensating for the swaying of the platform. Various systems are known for tensioning platform 
risers; however in most of them each riser is dealt with 
individually. An example of this kind of system has been 
described in US-A-4616708. A weight-relieving structure is 
set up on the platform, and is fitted with several pulleys 
over which pass the cables that are to tighten each riser. 
There is also a clamp placed around each riser so as to 
enable each riser to move up and down. The system is also 
provided with side stops to prevent the clamp from rotating 
relative to the riser, if the riser comes adrift from its 
base. Another kind of system has been disclosed by de Paiva 
Leite, A. J. - "An alternative FPS concept for offshore oil 
production" - 22nd Annual OTC, Houston, Texas, May 7-10, 1990  
 
- pp. 59-68. In this system the risers are grouped together within 
a structure shaped like a grid, and the grid is then 
tensioned. This arrangement works along with a semi-submersible 
platform, anchored and designed to meet the following 
requirements: 
(i) cheaper to build, (ii) optimized dimensions, (iii) arrangement for economising on space requirements, 
and (iv) safety, due regard being had to appropriate environmental constraints 
so that all relative movement between risers and platform is 
absorbed and compensated for. Though this system is quite satisfactory there are in 
actual fact some disadvantages to it. For instance, there is 
a lack of a lateral guiding system to centralize the

<CLAIMS>
A system for tensioning risers by means of an 
articulated grid, which risers stretch from the sea bottom up 

to sea surface to link undersea wells to their respective 
production trees which lie on a floating vessel; wherein a 

supporting structure (1) lies within an opening in the 
floating vessel (9); wherein risers (3), arranged in a 

circle around a moon-pool, are connected to the supporting 
str
ucture by means of a system (4) lying inside openings (2) 
provided in said supporting structure (1) for risers (3) to 

pass vertically through them; wherein the risers (3) are 
articulatable in relation to said supporting structure (1); 

wherein said supporting structure (1) is connected to the 
floating vessel (9) by means of tensioners (7) operated by 

chains (11) running from points on the structure of the 
floating vessel (9) to said supporting structure (1) and 

arranged around said supporting structure (1), enabling the 
supporting structure to move vertically in relation to said 

floating vessel (9); and wherein an articulation system (8), 
consisting of sliding blocks (18, 19), is provided to enable 

the supporting structure (1) to tilt in relation to any 
horizontal plane. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein the 
articulating system (4) that enables the risers (3) to move 

in relation to the supporting structure (1) consists of a 
ball joint (12) resting on a stop (13) lying inside an 

opening (2) within said supporting structure (1) and through 
which risers pass vertically, said ball joint (12) being 

traversed by said riser (3) which is fixed to it by means of 
upper (16) and lower (17) locking nuts. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
articulating system (8) allows said supporting structure (1) 

for the riser (3) to tilt in relation to any horizontal 
plane, and consists of longitudinal sliding blocks (18) and 

transverse sliding blocks (19) in the shape of a cross, 
 

installed at directly opposite points of the supporting 
structure (1) and which slide inside the lateral guides (10) 

lying at corresponding inside corners of the moon-pool (6) of 
the floating vessel (9), said sliding blocks (18, 19) being 

mounted on circular spindles (20, 21) that enable said 
supporting structure (1) to rotate and to translate in 

relation to the sliding blocks (18, 19); and including means 
to ensure that said supporting structure (1) is in constant 

contact with the floating vessel (9). 
A system according to claim 3, wherein said means 
to ensure that said supporting structure (1) is in contact 

with the vessel (9) consist of springs and/or shock 
absorbers. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
including a retracting operating deck (26) below the supporting 

structure (1) and able to move up or down mechanically 
and guided by guiding beams (27) that traverse it, said 

operating deck being provided with a working platform (28) 
that runs on a rotating track (29) so as to enable it to be 

brought next to each riser (3) in turn. 
A system according to claim 5, wherein said moon-pool 
(6) in the supporting structure (1) provides access to 

said retracting operating deck (26) below said supporting 
structure (1), to allow passage through the moon-pool of 

portable tools to adjust the tension individually on each 
riser (3) whenever required during operation without needing 

to remove any Xmas tree and without the aid of a crane.
