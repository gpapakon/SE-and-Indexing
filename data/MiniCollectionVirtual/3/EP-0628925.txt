<ABSTRACT>
An article information printer is composed of a 
feeding mechanism (11) for feeding continuous paper in 

which a series of label regions are provided, a SRAM (3) 
for storing size data regarding a length of the label 

region, a printing head section (10) for printing article 
information on the continuous paper fed by the feeding 

mechanism (11), and a control circuit (1, 5, 7) for 
controlling the feeding mechanism (11) on the basis of 

the size data stored in the SRAM (3) to print the article 
information in the label region. Particularly, the 

control circuit (1, 5, 7) has a feed sensing section (7) 
for sensing ends of the label region from the continuous 

paper fed by the feeding mechanism (11), and a processing 
unit (1, 5), responsive to start of power supply, 

for driving the feeding mechanism, measuring the length 
of the label region on the basis of a sensing signal 

from the sensing section which is obtained each time the 
continuous paper is fed by a preset distance, and setting 

a result of measurement in the SRAM (3) as the size 
data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article information
printer which performs printing on various types
of continuous paper.Such a printer is known from JP-A-62146661 (see preamble of claim 1).In large-scale retail stores or physical
distribution, articles are managed on the basis of
labels (including tags), which are attached to the
articles so as to display article codes, article names
and other article information items. The labels are
issued by using an article information printer which
prints the article information on a roll of continuous
paper. A typical article information printer receives,
from a host computer, various control commands, such as
a label size setting command, a feed command, a format
command, a label data command, etc., and performs a
process of issuing labels according to the control
commands.The label size setting command contains size data
representing a feed length equal to the distance between
the front ends of adjacent label regions in the
continuous paper, a label length equal to the distance
between the opposite ends of each label region, and a
space length equal to the rear end of the first label
region and the front end of the second label region.
The size data is used to determine the size of
a printed pattern and to control the paper feed of setting
the front end of each label region to a printing 
position.Conventionally, the article information printer
need not receive a label size setting command again to
issue labels of the different contents but of the same
size. In this case, the size data is retained in the
printer until a new label size setting command is
supplied, and used for a control of printing.However, to retain the size data, power must be
continuously supplied to the printer. The operator of
the host computer is unable to omit the transmission of
the label size setting command after another one uses
the printer, since the operator cannot confirm whether
the size data is erased due to an interruption of the
power supply. If the transmission of the label size
setting command is omitted where the size data is
erased, a printing error occurs. At this time, the
label size setting command must be supplied together
with the other control commands. Further, such a printing
error often occurs also when the transmission of the
label size setting command has been erroneously omitted
at the time of replacing the continuous paper with
another type. This gives the operator the impression
that the conventional article information printer has
but low operability.It is the

<CLAIMS>
An article information printer comprising:

a feeding mechanism (PR1, 11) for feeding continuous paper in
which a series of predetermined regions are provided;
a volatile memory (3) for storing size data representing a length
of the predetermined region;
printing means (HD) for printing article information on the
continuous paper fed by said feeding mechanism (PR1, 11);

and
control means (1, 5, 7) for controlling said feeding mechanism
(PR1, 11) on the basis of the size data stored in said volatile

memory (3) to print the article information in the predetermined
region of the continuous paper, wherein said control means

includes sensing means (7) for sensing a distinguishable feature
of the predetermined region from the continuous paper fed by

the feeding mechanism (PR1, 11), whereat
said control means further includes processing means (1, 5),
responsive to power supply which is resumed for driving said

feeding mechanism (PR1, 11), measuring the length of the
predetermined region on the basis of a sensing signal from the

sensing means (7) which is obtained, as a result of sensing by
said sensing means (7), each time the continuous paper is fed by

a preset distance, and setting size data indicating the measured
length of the predetermined region in said volatile memory (3)

to recover the size data;

characterized in that,
 
the printer receives in addition size data from an external device

to replace the measured size data and that the size data is erased C
from the volatile memory (3) due to an interruption of power

supply. 
An article information printer according to claim 1,
characterized in that said processing means (1,5) is further

responsive to a change in the type of continuous paper to
update the size data.
An article information printer according to claim 2,
characterized in that said processing means (1, 5) includes

switch means (5) for selecting the type of continuous paper.
An article information printer according to claim 1,
characterized in that said processing means (1, 5) measures the

length of the predetermined region together with a space
between the predetermined regions.
An article information printer according to claim 1,
characterized in that said sensing means (7) includes sensors

(TS, RS) each assigned to a corresponding type of continuous
paper.
An article information printer according to claim 1,
characterized in that said distinguishable feature is a mark

provided on said continuous paper.
