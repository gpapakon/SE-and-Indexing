<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a containerization system comprising at least one inner water soluble bag located within an outer water insoluble bag. The inner water soluble bag contains an agrichemical that does not sustantially dissolve the bag. The outer water insoluble bag is flexible and collapsible and has a low stretchability; it is made of laminated polypropylene (outer layer) polethylene (inner layer).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a containerization system and to containers 
which are particularly suitable for storing, packaging and transporting fluid 
agricultural chemical compounds, such as pesticides and concentrates thereof. At present, most hazardous and toxic liquids are stored in metal drums 
or, where smaller quantities are involved, in plastic containers. Hazardous 
compositions, especially agricultural chemicals (agrichemical), are formulated 
in various compositions. Agrichemicals in liquid form, particularly in the form of concentrates, 
are most convenient for farmers because of the relative ease with which they can 
be handled. There are, nevertheless, difficulties in handling such liquid 
compositions. There is a danger of spillage or leakage if holes develop in 
containers that are accidentally dropped and thereby crack or fail. Containers 
have been developed which possess great resistance to impact and shock. While 
such containers are secure under normal storage and handling conditions, in the 
event of an accident, for example during transporting, there remains an 
appreciable risk of spillage or leakage with rapid loss of liquid. Leakage of toxic 
and hazardous chemicals can create damage to the environment. The chemical and packaging industries have long sought a secure 
container which provides a sufficient safeguard for those handling it, such as 
farmers and transporters, as well as adequate protection for the environment.  
 It is known, for example, to package agrochemicals in soluble bags or 
sachets made from water soluble films. While considerable effort has been made 
and tremendous success in improving the strength of such bags, there still 
remains problems with the fragility of such bags resulting from sudden impact, 
for example from dropping. One solution for this problem is exemplified in patent application WO 
89/12590 where a water soluble bag containing a liquid agrichemical 
composition is encased in an outer container made of rigid or semi-rigid 
polymer such as polypropylene. Currently, there is a product available 
commercially in France called Geludoseâ„¢ (Ciba-Geigy) which is also a water 
soluble bag which is stored in a rigid polymeric container. U.S. patent 3,892,905 
describes water soluble packages. In that patent, overwraps are described such as 
single layer polyolefins cellophane glassine, foils, PVC, waxed paper and the 
like or combinaisons of those as laminates. However the intented use of these 
and the selection criteria for these were base on the

<CLAIMS>
A containerization system which comprises an inner water 
soluble bag containing a hazardous composition which inner bag is contained in 

a sealed outer bag or overwrap, the walls of the outer bag comprising a laminate 
of an outer layer of polypropylene and an inner layer of polyethylene, said 

overwrap having a low stretchability and being not filled to complete capacity, 
wherein the surface of the area delimitated by the external largest outline of the 

inner bag when inside the outer bag should be at least 5% less than the surface 
area delimitated by the external largest outline of the effectively containing part 

of the outer bag when containing the inner bag.
