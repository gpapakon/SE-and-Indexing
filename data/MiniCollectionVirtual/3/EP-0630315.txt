Method for the separating out of thermoplastic plastics material 
components (23 to 26) from a mixed stream during sorting of different 

thermoplastic plastics material kinds in contact with separating bodies 
(4, 14 to 16), characterised thereby that the plastics material 

components (23 to 26) are softening specific to kind by heating in the 
mixed stream in defined temperature ranges before they are engaged by the 

separating bodies (4, 14 to 16), after which the softened plastics 
material components (23 to 26) are fixed at the separating bodies (4, 14 

to 16), which penetrate into the softened surfaces of the plastics 
material components (23 to 26) or pierce the softened surfaces, and are 

finally taken away by the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
penetration of the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) into the surfaces of 

the plastics material components (23 to 26), which are softened during 
the heating specific to kind, is effected under the influence of the 

gravitational force of the plastics material components (23 to 26). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
penetration of the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) into the surfaces of 

the plastics material components (23 to 26), which are softened during 
the heating specific to kind, is effected by pressure force exerted in a 

gap (20) between a support surface (1 to 3, 21, 30, 31) and a separating 
body (4, 14 to 16). 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that the force required for the penetration of the separating 

bodies (4, 14 to 16) into the surfaces of the plastics material components 
(23 to 26), which are softened during the heating specific to kind, is 

determined by elastic yielding of the support surfaces (1 to 3, 21, 30, 
31) or separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) as well as by size and shape of 

the plastics material components (23 to 26).  
 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby that the surfaces of the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) are 

coated with an anti-adhesion coating. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby that the separating bodies are additionally heated in defined 

manner. 
Device for the separating out of thermoplastic plastics material 
components (23 to 26) during sorting of different kinds of plastics 

wastes, especially for the performance of the method according to the 
preceding claims, characterised by at least one separating body (4, 14 to 

16), which is effective as conveyor, with flat or curved surface with 
structures (10, 11) for penetration into or piercing of the plastics 

material components (23 to 26), which are previously selectively softened 
by heating specific to kind, as well as for firmly holding the plastics 

material components (23 to 26) at the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16), 
and by means for taking away of the plastics material components (23 to 

26), which are fixed at the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16), after their 
removal from the mixed stream (1), and by means for generation of defined 

temperature ranges for the selective heating of the plastics material 
components (23 to 26) in the mixed flow before engagement thereof by the 

separating bodies (4, 14 to 16). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised thereby that a separating 

body (4, 14 to 16) has a structured surface which is formed by grooving 
or milling (11a to 11c). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised thereby that the 
separating bodies (4) are rollers, belts or plates and equipped with 

brushes (4a), needles, pins (4b) or platelets (4c). 
Device according to claims 8 to 9, characterised thereby that a 
separating body (4, 14 to 16) forms a gap with a support surface (2, 3, 

21, 30, 31) and the support surface in that case is formed by a presser 
roller (2, 31) or a running belt (3, 30), wherein this is, from case to 

case, pressed against the place to be supported by one or more presser  
 

rollers (2) at the separating bodies (4). 
Device according to claim 10, characterised thereby that the presser 
rollers (2, 31) consist of metal, plastics material or soft elastic 

materials such as rubber or foam material or are formed from rubber or 
plastics material with an inflatable jacket (31). 
Device according to one or more of claims 7 to 11, characterised 
thereby that the surfaces of the separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) are 

provided with an anti-adhesion coating. 
Device according to one or more of claims 7 to 12, characterised 
by separating bodies (4, 14 to 16) additionally heated in defined manner. 
Device according to one or more of claims 7 to 12, characterised 
thereby that several identically or differently constructed devices (14 

to 16) are connected one after the other in the manner of a cascade.
