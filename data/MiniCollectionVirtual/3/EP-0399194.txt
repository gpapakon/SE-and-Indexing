<ABSTRACT>
In a disc brake, which can preferably be operated hydraulically, a piston (5) is guided inside a housing insert, located in a brake calliper, which piston (5), when subjected to pressure, may act against a brake shoe (15) supporting a brake lining (17) in such a manner that the brake shoe (15) with its brake lining is pressed onto the brake disc which is to be braked. On the side of the piston (5) facing the brake shoe there is provided a pressure plate (13) which is used for transmitting the pressure forces and has lateral mobility inside the recess (19), which holds it, of the piston (5). The pressure plate (13) is placed onto the end of a ram (25) which extends axially inside the piston (5), is supported on the opposite end, with respect to the pressure plate, by means of a disc (27) on the base (29) of the hole (31) holding the ram, and is surrounded by a pretensioned compression spring (37). Sideward movements of the pressure plate (13) lead to tipping of the ram (25) and, in consequence thereof, to a restoring force which is exerted by the compression spring (37) onto the ram (25) and hence onto the pressure plate (13), and which can be defined exactly by means of a variable position screwed ring (39) which supports one end of the compression spring (37).

Disc brake for vehicles, having a piston 
(5) in a housing (3) of the brake device and preferably 

capable of being loaded hydraulically, the piston being 
capable of operating relative to a brake block (15), 

carrying a brake lining (17), for the purpose of 
braking a brake disc, wherein at the face of the piston 

(5) facing the brake block (15) there is located a 
pressure plate (13) which can be moved transversely 

within specified limits, which pressure plate can be 
returned by means of a spring mechanism of defined 

resetting force from a position which is laterally 
deflected upon brake actuation into the zero position 

on release of the brake, characterized in that the 
spring mechanism has the following features: 


a) in a rearward extension of the pressure plate (13) 
there is located an axially extending bore (31); 
b) at the far end (29) of the bore (31) with respect 
to the pressure plate (13) there is supported a 

disc (27), from which a pushrod (25) connected 
therewith extends with clearance from the inner 

wall of the bore up to and into the pressure plate 
(13), with the end of the pushrod opposite the 

disc (27) being received in a recess (35) of the 
pressure plate (13); 
c) the pushrod (25) is surrounded by a compression 
spring (37) which is supported on one side on the 

disc (27) and on the other side on a screw ring 
(39) screwed with respect to the inner wall of the 

bore (31); 
d) the pushrod (25) passes axially through the screw 
ring (39) with clearance in such a way that a 

specified degree of freedom for tilting movements 
of the pushrod (25) is given, and 
e) the end of the pushrod opposite the disc (27) is  
 

guided by means of a preferably rounded pushrod 
head (33) in an appropriately formed recess (35) 

of the pressure plate (13). 
Disc brake according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the screw ring (39) can be 

screwed within the thread of the bore (31) in a 
position-variable manner for the purpose of changing 

the prestressing of the compression spring (37). 
Disc brake according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there is 

located between the face of the piston (5) facing the 
pressure plate (13) and the pressure plate (13) a 

sliding plate (41) of low friction coefficient in such 
a way that the pressure plate (13) can be displaced on 

the sliding plate (41) in the lateral direction 
relative to it and can be returned into the zero 

position by means of the spring mechanism. 
Disc brake according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by the following 

features: 

a) a groove (43) is located at the outer 
circumference of the pressure plate (13); 
b) in the region of the recess (19) receiving the 
pressure plate (13) there is allocated a groove-shaped 

undercut on the piston (5), lying opposite 
the groove (43); 
c) for the assembly of the pressure plate (13) which 
can be undone quickly there is inserted into the 

groove (43) of the pressure plate a holding ring 
(21) which is of oval shaping, in such a way that 

the large diameter of the ring abuts the inner 
wall of the groove-shaped undercut of the piston 

and the small diameter of the ring abuts the inner 
diameter of the groove (43) of the pressure plate. 
Disc brake according to claim 4, 
characterized in that by means of a tool the holding  

 
ring (21) can be compressed into the shape of a ring 

and can be lifted from the groove-shaped undercut or 
the groove (43).
