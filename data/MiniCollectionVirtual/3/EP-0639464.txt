<ABSTRACT>
In a dot print head (1) of an impact type moved in a 
direction of spacing movement relative to a printing medium (32), 

and having a plurality of printing elements each having a 
printing wire (20) arranged substantially in an elongated circle 

centered at a line parallel with the direction in which the 
printing elements are driven, and which is provided with a 

wire guide (21) having guide elements for the respective printing 
wires for guiding tips of the printing wires to 

predetermined positions on said printing medium (32), the guide 
elements are divided into at least four rows each extending 

in the direction orthogonal to said direction of the spacing 
movement and orthogonal to the direction in which the 

printing wires extend, and distances between said rows are 
multiples of 1/240 inches. Each of the printing elements is 

driven for printing either at a reference timing which 
occurs once a standard printing cycle having a standard 

period, at a timing 1/4 of the standard period past said 
reference timing, at a timing half the standard period past 

said reference timing, or at a timing 3/4 of the standard 
period past said reference timing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dot print head used
in a serial dot printer, a printer having such a dot print
head, a method of control over a printer, and a method of
printing using such a control.Impact type printers performing printing by impact on a
printing medium with wires through ink ribbon are widely
used, as output devices of information processing systems
and the like, since they can be used for a variety of
printing media, and they are relatively less costly.The impact type printers can be divided into those of
the spring-charge type, those of the plunger type, and those
of the clapper type.In a printer of the spring-charge type, an armature to
which a wire is fixed is supported by a plate spring such
that it can be swung, and the armature is normally attracted
to a core by means of a permanent magnet, overcoming a
resilient force of the plate spring, and printing is
performed by energizing a coil wound on the core to create a
magnetic flux opposing the magnetic flux of the permanent
magnet, to thereby release the armature. As the demand for
higher printing speed is increasing in recent years,
printers having the dot print head of the spring-charge type 
having a high-speed response are widely used.Fig. 1 is a side view showing an example of the
structure of a dot print head of the spring-charge type in
the prior art. In Fig. 1, the left half shows a section for
illustrating the internal structure.Referring to Fig. 1, a wire dot print head 1 is
provided with an electrically conducting board 2 which is
mounted to a rear surface of a base 3 via an insulating
board, not shown.Stacked in turn on the upper surface of the base 2 are
a first yoke 4, a permanent magnet 5, a second yoke 6, and a
spacer 7. These are integrated by means not shown.Provided on the spacer 7 are a plate spring 8, a third
yoke 9, an armature 10, a guide nose 11 and a guide frame
12, which are positioned by knock pins not shown and stacked
in turn.Disposed on the rear surface of the base 3 is a cap 14
with heat radiating fins 13 covering and protecting the
printed circuit board 2.The print head 11 is integrated by means of a clamp
spring 16 which is engaged with the upper surface of the
guide frame 12 and an engagement catch 15 of the cap 14.More specifically, provided on the base 3 are
electromagnets comprising coils 19 wound via coil bobbins 18
on the outer periphery of the cores 17, the electromagnets 
being provided in number corresponding to the printing wires
20, and arranged radially. The terminals 19a of the
