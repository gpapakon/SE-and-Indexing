<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new enzyme and to its use.Current synthesises of the analgesic hydromorphone
(dihydromorphinone) and the antitussive hydrocodone
(dihydrocodeinone) use uneconomic reagents, chemical
catalysts and activating groups, and have undesirable
effects on the environment. For example, hydromorphone is
made by catalytic reduction of morphine with finely-divided
platinum or palladium in acidic media. The product is
purified by the addition of sulphur dioxide gas to
saturation point. This mixture is left to crystallise over
a period of 4-5 days, the complex is filtered, dried, and
then decomposed by heating at 90 °C in concentrated
hydrochloric acid until sulphur dioxide evolution ceases.Biocatalysts can provide a cleaner technology.
However, the range of enzyme activities presently available
is rather limited, and these enzymes do not catalyse the
reaction required.GB-A-2231332 describes an acetylmorphine carboxylase
that catalyses the hydrolysis of heroin, 3-acetylmorphine
and 6-acetylmorphine to morphine, and also a morphine
dehydrogenase that oxidises morphine to morphinone,
utilising NADP as a cofactor. These enzymes are obtained
from a novel strain of Pseudornonesputida designated as
"M10", NCIMB 40119. They can be used for the detection of
heroin and morphine.The present invention is based on the discovery of an
enzyme which can be used as a biocatalyst in the synthesis
of hydromorphone and hydrocodone. This is a highly
specific NADH-dependent reductase that catalyses the
reduction of the 7,8-unsaturated bond of morphinone and
codeinone. The reaction of the enzyme, morphinone
reductase, requires a cofactor such as reduced nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) which is oxidised to NAD+
concurrently with the reduction of morphinone to
hydromorphone.The morphinone reductase of the invention can be
defined in different several ways, but is probably best
defined by its partial amino-acid sequence shown below, in
the Sequence Listing.Alternatively, or in addition, the morphinone
reductase of the invention can be characterised by any of
the following properties. With the aid of a cofactor,
notably NADH, it reduces morphinone and codeinone to
hydromorphone and hydrocodone, respectively. It also
reduces neopinone to hydrocodone. It has no significant
activity with other compounds of similar ring structure.
Another distinguishing feature of the morphinone reductase
is that it has a native molecular weight of 81,000 Dalton
(as determined by elution from a gel filtration column
calibrated
