<ABSTRACT>
A carbon analyzer capable of measuring carbon contents of both 
liquid and solid samples under appropriate conditions includes 

not only basic components of a total organic carbon (TOC) 
analyzer such as a carrier gas supplying unit 22, a sample 

injection unit 2 for a liquid sample 6, a liquid sample 
combustion-oxidation vessel 12 and a CO
2
 detector 46, but also 
a solid sample intake unit 26 for receiving a solid sample, 

converting its carbon components into CO
2
 and sending it into 
the CO
2
 detector 46 together with a carrier gas. The CO
2
 
detector 46 is a non-dispersive infrared analyzer with two 

measuring cells 48a and 48b having different lengths and 
disposed in series with a light flux such that the light flux 

will have different optical path lengths through these 
measuring cells 48a and 48b. A switching valve 44 serves to 

direct the gas to be tested selectively to either of the 
measuring cells 48a and 48b and the carrier gas to the other 

as a purge gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carbon analyzer, and more
particularly to an apparatus for measuring both the total
organic carbon (TOC) content of a sample in the form of
aqueous solution and the carbon content of a solid sample.In the case of a liquid sample, TOC measurements in the range
of several ppm to several 100 ppm are of principal importance, 
and several 10Âµl (or several 10mg) of the sample is usually
used. It is difficult, however, to inject a large amount of
such a sample into a combustion-oxidation reaction tube at
high temperature because its water component is suddenly
vaporized and increases its volume. On the other hand, the
carbon content of solid samples is much higher, ranging
between several 1000 ppm to several %. The weight of a solid
sample can be easily measured by a balance, and it is
preferable to make use of several 10 - several 100 mg of a
sample in order to prevent uneven carbon concentration. This
means that about 100 times more CO2 is generated from a solid
sample than from a liquid sample.Since most carbon analyzers are designed primarily for samples
in the form of aqueous solution, the NDIR measuring cells are
also designed primarily for samples in the form of aqueous
solution. If such a measuring cell is used for the
measurement of a solid sample, either the measurement can be
done only for a lower concentration of carbon or only a small
amount of the sample can be used.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
a carbon analyzer capable of measuring the carbon content of
both aqueous solutions and solid samples under appropriate
conditions. It is another object of the invention to provide
a carbon analyser capable of varying sensitivity of
measurements when there is a change in the carbon
concentration in the sample or the amount of the
sample changes.DE-C-4,115,425 discloses a device for measuring
total organic carbon as set out in the precharacterising
part of claim 1. The device includes
an NDIR analyser provided with two measuring cells of
equal length, disposed in a parallel with respect to
the flux of light.US-A-3985505 describes a system for the
determination of the carbon content of solid samples.
The system comprises a single infrared gas analyser.EP-A-0,319,887 shows a device suitable for the
detection of CO2 in gases including an NDIR analyser
having a longer and shorter measuring cell disposed in
series with respect to the flux of light. The device
is arranged only to treasure the TOC content of
liquids.According to the present invention,
