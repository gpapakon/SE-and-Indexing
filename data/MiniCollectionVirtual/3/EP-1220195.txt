<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a singing voice synthesizing apparatus that synthesizes a singing voice, a method of synthesizing a singing voice, and a program for realizing the method thereof.In the past, there has been a wide range of attempts to synthesize singing voice.One of these attempts, an application of speech synthesis by rule, receives inputs of pitch data, which corresponds to the pitch of a note, and of lyric data, and synthesizes speech using a synthesis-by-rule device for text-to-speech synthesis. In most cases, raw waveform data or analyzed and parameterized data are stored in a database in units of phonemes or phoneme chains comprised of two or more phonemes. At the time of synthesis, required voice fragments (phonemes or phoneme chains) are selected, concatenated, and synthesized. Examples are disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications (Kokai) Nos. S62-6299, H10-124082, and H11-1184490, among others.However, since the object of these technologies is to synthesize a speaking voice, they are not always capable of synthesizing a singing voice with satisfactory quality.For example, a singing voice synthesized by a method of overlapping and adding waveforms as typified by PSOLA (Pitch-Synchronous OverLap and Add) has a good degree of comprehensibility, but often has the problems of unnatural sounding of elongated tones, for which the quality of a singing voice varies the greatest, and an unnatural sounding synthesized voice when there are slight fluctuations of pitch and vibrato, which are essential for a singing voice.Moreover, attempting to synthesize a singing voice using a waveform concatenating type speech synthesizing device with a large-scale corpus base would require an astronomically large number of fragment data if the original data are to be concatenated and output without any processing.On the other hand, synthesizers whose original purpose is for synthesizing a singing voice have also been proposed. A well-known example is the synthesis method of formant synthesis (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 3-200300). However, although this method offers a large degree of freedom with respect to the quality and fluctuations of vibrato and pitch of elongated sounds, the clarity of synthesized sounds (especially consonants) is poor, and therefore quality is not always satisfactory.US-A- 5029509 discloses a technique known as Spectral Modeling Synthesis (SMS) for analyzing and synthesizing a musical sound using a model that expresses an original sound as
