<ABSTRACT>
In the method described for forming hollow metallic profiles with the assistance of internal pressure to give workpieces (1) provided with branches or the like (12), a liquid pressure medium is fed to the interior of the blank, which is mounted in a die (2) and is brought into engagement at its two ends with movable press rams (3, 4), and the blank is pressed into at least one cavity (7) in the die (2) with the aid of the press rams, expanding in the process; during this procedure, the pressure (pi) of the pressure medium in the interior of the blank, which is closed off by the press rams (3, 4) and is heat-treated before the pressing operation, is controlled as a function of the progress made in pressing, the pressure (pi) being set in such a way in process phases in which there is little stretching of the material of the blank that essentially the yield strength of the material is just reached, whereas, in process phases in which the stretching is great, the pressure (pi) is increased in order to raise the breaking elongation of the material.

A method for internal pressure supported forming of
metallic hollow sections in tools to work pieces (1) provided

with bulges, necks, branchings or the like, wherein a liquid
pressure medium is supplied to the interior of a blank arranged

in the tool (2) which, at its front sides, is engaged with at
least one movable press die and one stationary counter-holding

tool part, preferably with two movable press dies (3, 4), the
blank is pressed, under bulging, into at least one cavity (7) in

the tool (2), by aid of the press die(s) (3, 4), and the
pressure of the pressure medium in the interior of the blank

sealed off by the press die and the stationary counter-holding
tool part or by the press dies (3, 4) is controlled in

dependence on the process progress at pressing, preferably in
dependence on the distance (5) passed by the press die,

characterised in that in process phases with slight elongations
(ϕ) of the material, the pressure (pi) of the pressure medium is

adjusted such that the comparative strain formed on the basis of
the spatial state of stress in the work piece (2) substantially

just reaches the mean tensile strength (k
f
) of the material,
whereas in process phases with strong elongations (ϕ), the

pressure (pi) of the pressure medium is increased so as to
sufficiently raise the elongation at break of the material by

lowering the mean tension.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
pressure medium is adjusted to a slight overpressure (pa), e.g.

in the range of from 300 to 600 bar, at the beginning of the
pressing procedure, and to a maximum value (pe), e.g. in the

range of a few kbar, towards the end of the pressing procedure.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
during the pressing procedure, the pressure medium is adjusted

to a maximum pressure (pe) of at least 80% of the tensile
strength of the material of the blank.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that in pressing phases, in which the material 

of the blank flows around small radii of curvature of the tool
(2), the pressure (pi) of the pressure medium is adjusted to 5%

to 40% of the maximum pressure during pressing, depending on the
wall thickness (w).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that already before pressing the blank, the

pressure medium is adjusted to an increased bias pressure (pv),
preferably 5% to 20%, in particular approximately 10% of the

maximum pressure (pe) reached during pressing, e.g. to a value
in the range of from 100 to 1000 bar.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the blank is filled with pressure medium

before the pressing procedure so as to be free from gas bubbles,
and that the pressure medium is adjusted to an increased

pressure (pi) by means of a pump (18).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that in case of blank materials exhibiting

segregations of alloying components to the grain boundaries, in
particular of high-strength aluminum alloys, a heat treatment is

carried out before the pressing procedure such that the
ductility of the material is increased by incorporation of these

alloying components into the grain lattices, and that the
pressing procedure is carried out within a given time-window,

e.g. 1h to 4h after the heat treatment, yet before the
occurrence of a renewed segregation of the alloying components

to the grain boundaries.
A method according to claim 7, characterised in that
blanks of AlMgSi alloys are heated in an annealing furnace at

approximately 400°C for, approximately, 100 minutes,
subsequently are cooled in air and are pressed approximately 3

hours after termination of the annealing furnace heat treatment.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein,
when compressing the blank in the (respective) tool cavity (7),

into which the material of the blank is moulded, a 
variable counter-holding tool part (13) having a cross-sectional

shape corresponding to the (respective) portion to be
bulged, is counter-held, characterised in that counter-holding

with the (respective) variable tool part (13) is effected under
the control of pressure and/or distance and the force introduced

thereby into the work-piece is selected such that the mean
tension
 (the hydrostatic tension portion) occurring in sum in
the work piece (1) is reduced so much that the elongation at

break determined thereby becomes greater than the greatest
elongation occurring in the respective work piece portion

supported by the variable tool part (13).
A method according to claim 9, characterised in that the
force (Fg) applied by the variable counter-holding tool part

(13) is adjusted to at least 5% of the force exerted by the
internal pressure in the blank on the portion to be bulged.
A method according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in that
when simultaneously making several bulges, branchings or the

like (12, 12') and thus when using several variable pressure-controlled
counter-holding tool parts (13, 13'), a distance

control or measurement, respectively, is carried out in addition
to the pressure control thereof so as to adapt their pressure

control when the variable counter-holding tool parts (13, 13')
perform movements of un-equal speeds.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the lubricant applied in zones having a

small surface-radius of curvature of the blank or of the tool,
respectively, in particular at rounded-off edges, is by at least

50% more than that applied on the remaining portions of blank
and tool (2), respectively.
