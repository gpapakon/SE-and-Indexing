<ABSTRACT>
An upper bearing assembly (20) for a bicycle steerer tube (10) which 
generally includes a lower race (21), a ball bearing (22) integral with an 

upper race (22a) and mounted in the lower race (21), a watertight cover (230) 
mounted above the ball bearing (22), a compression nut (23) mounted above 

the watertight cover (230), a compression washer (24) mounted around a top 
portion of a substantially inverted T-shaped cutout (231) of the compression 

nut (23), a compression cap (25) mounted above the compression washer (24) 
and having a skirt portion (254) surrounding the compression washer (24). 

The compression washer (24) includes a thinner portion (242) and a thicker 
portion (240) which has a substantially V-shaped groove (241) formed in an 

outer periphery thereof. The skirt portion (254) of the compression cap (25) 
has a threaded hole (250) extending obliquely therein in which a compression 

bolt (251) locates. The oblique threaded hole (250) aligns with the V-shaped 
groove (241) in the compression washer (24). When the compression bolt (251) 

is driven at a first end thereof (253) and is thus moved inward in the oblique 
threaded hole (250), the second end (252) of the compression bolt (251) 

contacts and compresses the compressing washer (24) at the V-shaped groove 
(241), the compression cap (25), the compression washer (24), the compression 

nut (23), and the steerer tube (10) as a whole are tightly engaged together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved upper 
bearing assembly for a bicycle steerer tube. In a bicycle, the steerer tube is rotatable relative 
to the head tube by means of upper and lower bearing 
assemblies which are conventionally coupled to the steerer 
tube by threading engagement which tends to be loosened due 
to vibrations during cycling. Complicated designs have been 
proposed to solve this problem, but cause the whole structure 
to become intolerably intricate. The present invention provides an improved upper 
bearing assembly to mitigate and/or obviate the above-mentioned 
problem. The present invention provides an upper bearing 
assembly which generally includes a lower race, a ball 
bearing integral with an upper race and mounted in the lower 
race, a watertight cover mounted above the ball bearing, a 
compression nut mounted above the watertight cover, a 
compression washer mounted around a top portion of a 
substantially inverted T-shaped cutout of the compression 
nut, a compression cap mounted above the compression washer 
and having a skirt portion surrounding the compression 
washer. A sealing ring may be provided between the outer 
periphery of the steerer tube and the inner periphery of the 
compression cap. The compression washer includes a thinner wall portion 
and a thicker wall portion which has a substantially V-shaped 
groove formed in an outer periphery thereof. The skirt  
 
portion of the compression cap has a threaded hole extending 
obliquely therein in which a compression bolt locates. The 
oblique threaded hole aligns with the V-shaped groove in the 
compression washer. When the compression bolt is driven at a first end 
thereof and is thus moved inward in the oblique threaded 
hole, the second end of the compression bolt contacts and 
compresses the compressing washer at the V-shaped groove. 
This urges the thicker portion of the compression washer to 
compress the compression nut, which results in a horizontal 
force between the compression cap, the compression washer, 
and the compression nut. Accordingly, the width of the upper 
portion of the inverted T-shaped cutout decreases. Since the 
inner diameter of the compression nut decreases, the 
compression cap, the compression washer, the compression nut, 
and the steerer tube as a whole are tight, i.e., the upper 
bearing assembly is securely mounted around the upper 
periphery of the steerer tube for steering function and the 
resultant structure is not easy to be loosened under 
vibrations during cycling.
