<ABSTRACT>
A process for filtering out solid particles from liquids and backwashing the filter operates with a filter drum 5 arranged completely beneath the liquid surface 6, the circumferential surface 7 of which filter drum is covered with a filter medium 8 and through which the flow passes from the outside to the inside. Any backwash apparatus for removing the filter cake from the filter medium 8 is provided. At the beginning of each backwash cycle, an air cushion 15 is introduced into the filter drum 5 and thus the liquid in the filter drum 5 is displaced in such a way that, via a spray device 19 which is arranged unsealed in the interior of the filter drum 5 and has a spray head 17, liquid is sprayed through the air cushion 15 onto the rear side of the circumferential surface 7 of the filter drum 5. The filter cake detached in this manner is transported away on the outside by a liquid current in accordance with arrow 22.

A process for the filtration of solid particles from liquids 
and the backwashing of the filter, with a filter drum (5) 

positioned completely below the liquid level (6) and arranged at 
least about horizontally, the filter drum having a cylindrical 

surface (7) coated with a filter medium (8), the liquid flowing 
through the outside of the filter drum to the inside, and a 

backwashing device for the removal of the filter cake from the 
filter medium, whereby a spraying liquid is sprayed by an 

ejection apparatus (19) including a spraying head (17) positioned 
in the interior of the filter drum (5) in the direction 

of the backside of the cylindrical surface (7) of the filter 
drum (5) so that the filter cake is removed by being withdrawn 

at the outside of filter drum (5) in a stream of liquid, 
wherein
 
at the beginning of each cycle of backwashing an air cushion 

(15) is introduced in the filter drum (5) and thus liquid in the 
filter drum (5) is displaced, and the liquid jets are sprayed 

from the ejection apparatus (19) arranged in the interior of the 
filter drum (5) without being sealed to the filter drum penetrating 

through the air cushion (15) to the backside of the 
cylindrical surface (7) of the filter drum (5). 
The process of claim 1, 
wherein
 the removed filter cake is 
withdrawn by a suction head (21) of a suction apparatus (20), 

the suction head (21) being spaced apart a distance from the 
filter drum. 
The process of claim 1, 
wherein
 the removed filter cake is 
withdrawn in a flotation reservoir (24). 
The process of claim 1, 
wherein
 the air cushion (15) is 
completed during a cycle of backwashing.  

 
An apparatus for carrying out the process of one of the 
claims 1 to 4, containing a filter drum (5) positioned 

completely below the liquid level (6) and arranged at least 
about horizontally and having a cylindrical surface (7) coated 

with a filter medium (8), liquid flown from the outside of the 
filter drum to the inside of the filter drum, and a backwashing 

device located in fixed manner with an ejection apparatus (19) 
including a spraying head (17) for removal of the filter cake 

from the filter medium (8), 
wherein
 an inlet conduit (14) for 
air provided to generate an air cushion (15) extends into the 

interior of the filter drum (5), and the ejection apparatus (19) 
including the spraying head (17) is fixed at a distance to the 

upper region of the interior of filter drum (5), without being 
sealed with respect to the cylindrical surface (7) of filter 

drum (5). 
The apparatus of claim 5, 
wherein
 above the spraying head 
(17) on the outside of filter drum (5) a suction head (21) of a 

suction apparatus (20) is located below the liquid level (6) at 
a fixed distance with respect to the surface (7) of the filter 

drum (5), the suction head in position with respect to the 
filter medium (8) of filter drum (5). 
The apparatus of claim 5, 
wherein
 above the spraying head 
(17) on the outside of filter drum (5) there is a connection to 

a flotation reservoir (24), which contains a device (28) for 
ejecting microbubbles (29). 
The apparatus of claim 7, 
wherein
 the flotation reservoir 
(24) has an overflow (30) and is connected with the liquid 

surrounding the filter drum (5). 
The apparatus of claims 5 to 8, 
wherein
 the filter drum (5) 
with its axis (4) is supported horizontally on an outlet tube 

(9).  
 
The apparatus of claim 9, 
wherein
 the outlet tube (9) 
extends into a filtration chamber (10), in which an overflow 

(11) is located below the liquid level (6).
