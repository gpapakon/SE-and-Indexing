<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a novel method for
preparation of high density peptide (or other polymer) libraries,
and for screening such libraries for peptide having the capacity
to recognize targets of choice.Many biological phenomena are known to involve the
interaction of peptides with a macromolecular target, such as a
protein. Such peptides include the vasoactive intestinal
peptide, the angiotensins, and the endothelins.For such an interaction to occur, the peptide must be able
to fold into a conformation in which it presents a surface which
is complementary to a critical region, e.g., a catalytic pocket,
of the target molecule. While short peptides that interact with
proteins or other biomolecules are used in research and clinical
therapy (Magazine, 1991; Bischoff, 1992; Baumbach, 1992), the
rational design of peptides to bind to new targets, or to enhance
or render more specific their binding to a known target, is
difficult.In peptides, the number of total chemical structures is
determined by the number of different amino acids used and by the
peptide length, e.g., from 20 amino acids it is possible to
synthesize 209 different peptides with a length of 9 amino acids.If one cannot rationally predict the peptides which will
have the desired binding activities, it is desirable to be able
to screen, simultaneously, a large number of peptides of
different sequences, which are prepared and presented in a manner
which facilitates identification of binding peptides. Such a 
collection of peptides is called a "peptide library." (Birbaum,
1992; Amato, 1992).One method for construction of a peptide library is by
genetic engineering (Scott 1990, Cwirla 1990, Devlin 1990).
Peptides are expressed as part of a surface protein on the pIII
protein on the outer surface of a filamentous phage. Phages
reacting specifically with a target of choice are selected by
panning and expanded. The relevant DNA sequence of the selected
phages is then determined. The identified peptide sequences are
deduced from the identified DNA sequences. The advantages of
this approach to peptide library are speed and convenience. The
major disadvantage is that the peptide library only contains
linear (non-branched) peptides composed of the 20 native, L-amino
acids.Another approach for the generation of a peptide library is
chemical synthesis. The major advantage of the chemical approach
is the ability to produce peptides whose composition is not
limited to the twenty genetically encoded amino acids. The use
of a large number of
