<ABSTRACT>
A dishwashing machine is described, comprising a washing chamber (3) wherein 
at least a crockery basket (4) is housed to which a vertical tubular element (9) is 

associated, the upper end of said vertical tubular element (9) being able to receive 
a liquid flow exiting the end of a conduit (11) coming from a pump (6), said end of 

said conduit (11) being upstream, substantially coaxial and at a certain distance 
from said vertical tubular element (9), and the lower end of said vertical tubular 

element (9) being connected to a spraying organ (8), in particular rotatable around 
the axis of said vertical tubular element (9). The main feature of the described 

dishwashing machine consists in the fact in the internal upper wall (3A) of said 
washing chamber (3), in correspondence of said end of said conduit (11), a 

terminal element (10) is provided having variable length, which, when said 
spraying organ (8) is supplied with liquid in pressure coming from said pump (6) 

through said conduit (11), lengthens downwards in the way of eliminating the 
distance existing between said end of said conduit (11) and said vertical tubular 

element (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a dishwashing machine as described in the 
preamble of the annexed claim 1. As is known, modern dishwashing machine are provided with a washing chamber 
wherein an upper crockery basket and a lower crockery basket are arranged; 
dishes are sprinkled by means of two rotary collectors, that spray the washing 
liquid onto the dishes, and which are fed with liquid in pressure coming from a 
suitable washing pump, arranged in the basement of the machine. The lower 
collector is generally fed, and supported, by means of a tubular element from the 
bottom, directly from body of the pump, while the upper collector is normally fed 
from the top: a nozzle arranged in the roof of the washing chamber, supplied 
through a conduit coming from the pump, sends downwards a liquid jet and said 
jet, after having crossed an air gap, reaches a suitable funnel-shaped receiving 
element, fixed to the upper basket of the machine; the air gap separating the 
nozzle and the receiving element is provided for allowing the horizontal sliding of 
the basket, for the normal crockery loading and unloading operations. The receiving funnel element, that bears the upper rotary collector and is in 
communication with it, usually uses a Venturi tube system, for avoiding turbulences 
and regurgitations in the flow of the liquid. The liquid jet that exits the nozzle, however, crosses the free air gap and enters 
with an high speed in the receiving funnel element, hiting the walls of the latter and 
generating a noise that can be heard for all the duration of the washing, so making 
the apparatus noisy.  Furthermore, the upper basket of the dishwashing machine usually is adjustable in 
height (i.e. capable of assuming two different positions, an higher one and a lower 
one, inside of the washing chamber), and the free air gap may be greater or minor, 
depending on the conditions of use of the dishwasher; it is clear that when the 
upper rack is placed in the lower position, the distance' in air that the flow has to 
follow is greater; in such a case therefore the possibility that a part of the liquid 
misses the receiving funnel element is increased, and so finishes out of it, 
decreasing the efficiency of the washing; another negative effect in such a 
condition of use is a greater noise developed by the flow for entering the funnel. 
In the attempt to solve the problem of minimizing the noise and the losses of the 
flow in pressure, dishwashing machine machines have been proposed, equipped 
with means apt at
