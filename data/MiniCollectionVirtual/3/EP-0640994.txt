<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide superconductor 
thin film of high quality and a method of manufacturing 
the thin film stably. Niobium nitride (NbN) and niobium germanium (Nb3Ge) 
of A15 type binary compound were known as high temperature 
superconductors. However, the superconducting transition 
temperatures of these materials are 23 K at most. On the 
other hand, perovskite structure compounds were expected to 
have higher transition temperatures and high temperature 
superconductors of Ba-La-Cu-O system were suggested (J. 
Bednorz and K. A. Muller, Zeitschrift für Physik B-Condensed 
Matter 64, 189-193 (1986)). Further, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O 
materials were found to have transition temperatures 
of 100 K or more (H. Maeda, Y. Tanaka, M. Fukutomi and T. 
Asano, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics 27, L209-L210 
(1988), and Z. Z. Sheng and A. M. Herman, Nature 332, 55-58 
(1988)). The details of the mechanism of the superconductivity 
of these kinds of oxide materials are not yet clear. 
However, there is a possibility that they have a transition  
 
temperature higher than room temperature, and applications in 
electronic device area are expected with use of these 
materials more than with use of the prior binary compounds. In order to use an oxide high temperature superconductor 
such as Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O practically, 
it is demanded to manufacture it in a form of thin film. 
However, it is difficult previously to prepare a thin film 
having good superconducting characteristics. It is known that 
Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system has phases having different 
superconducting transition temperatures, and it was very 
difficult to prepare the phase itself of 100 K or more of 
superconducting transition temperature in a form of thin film. Further, an insulator or a dielectric film of 
thickness of a few tens nanometers is needed in order to 
manufacture a periodic layered structure of superconductors 
and insulators layered alternately and an integrated device 
with use of such a layered structure. Especially, it is very 
difficult to manufacture a periodically layered structure of 
high temperature oxide superconductor films and insulator 
films. In order to prepare a thin film having good 
superconducting characteristics, it was necessary to conduct 
heat treatment or heating process on preparation. However, 
this causes mutual diffusion of atoms between the insulator 
and superconductor films so as to deteriorate the characteristics 
of the constituent layers. When an insulator
