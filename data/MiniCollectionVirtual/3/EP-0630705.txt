<ABSTRACT>
A process and system for the production of column 
radiator elements according to which the radiator 

elements (1), having two heads (2) and a plurality of 
columns (11) which connect the heads (2) together in a 

watertight manner are obtained by forming blanks (8, 60) 
by stamping, each of which blanks has at least one half-head 

(3, 61) which is coupled to another half-head (3, 
61) to obtain a hollow body (22, 73) defining at least 

one head (2) which is coupled by welding to another head 
(2) with the interposition of a plurality of columns 

(11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of elements for column radiators and, in 
particular, column radiators of the type comprising a 
plurality of elements each of which has two heads and at 
least two columns which connect the two heads together. It is known to make the above-indicated elements by means 
of a process according to which each element is obtained 
starting from two hollow blanks made by stamping and each 
incorporating two half-heads, which are positioned over 
one another with their concave sides facing one another, 
and are connected together by spark welding in such a way 
as to obtain a hollow body comprising two heads and 
having a welding bead, which latter is removed in part by 
means of a shear device, and in part by means of a 
lapping machine. Subsequently the said hollow body is cut transversely 
into two parts to obtain two heads which are again 
connected together by spark welding with the 
interposition of two or more tubular columns to form a 
said radiator element having, at each end of each column, 
a welding bead which is removed in part by a shear device 
and in part by means of a lapping machine. The known process described above has numerous  
 
disadvantages. In particular the use of spark welding makes it necessary 
that the bodies to be welded together have excess 
material at their respective edges to be joined so that 
the edges themselves can be brought to fusion 
temperature. During welding this excess material is 
partly sprayed away and partly enlarges the welding bead. In essence the known process described above causes the 
production of a relatively high quantity of waste 
material constituted by the welding beads, which must be 
reduced by suitable shearing and lapping machines with 
the use of specialised labour. At the completion of the known process described above, 
the radiator elements obtained still always have welding 
surplus in that, because of the relatively small working 
space, it is not normally possible to lap the parts of 
weld bead between adjacent columns. As far as the previously-mentioned spark welding is 
concerned, it is suitable to raise the point that the 
excess material which is sprayed away during welding 
contaminates the welding machines which must therefore 
frequently be stopped for cleaning and maintenance. 
Finally, spark welding also involves the use of a large 
quantity of welding electrodes and heat fatiguing of the  
 
material to be welded. From the above it will be immediately understood
