<ABSTRACT>
A device for kneading dough comprises a frame (1) to accommodate a container (7) for the dough to be processed, (which container can rotate about a vertical axis (9) under the action of a drive (8). The frame (1) supports two kneading tools (3, 4), both of which are coupled at their upper ends to a crank arm (19). Both crank arms (19) revolve in opposite directions about horizontal axes. Each kneading tool (3, 4) is also coupled to the frame (1) via a connecting rod (27) running from the kneading tool (3, 4) outwards to the coupling point (29) on the frame (1). Both crank arms (19) are arranged mutually offset so that the lifting and lowering movements of the two kneading tools (3, 4) occur at different times, thereby imitating manual kneading and improving the mixing action.

Apparatus for kneading dough, comprising a support (1) 
receiving a container (7) for the dough to be rotatable about a 

vertical axis (9), drive means (8) for such rotation, and at 
least two kneading tools (3,4) having rod-shaped basic bodies 

(17) which protrude into the container (7) from above and which 
are coupled at their upper ends with crank arms (44) rotating 

about horizontal axes (20) in opposite directions and in-between 
their ends with guide rod means (27) pivotally connected 

to the support (1) so that the lower end of each kneading tool 
(3,4) carries out a kneading movement with a closed trajectory 

of motion and the directions of both crank arms deviate from a 
mirror-inverted arrangement with respect to a vertical plane 

located centrally between the two crank arms (19) so that the 
lifting and lowering movements of both kneading tools (3,4) are 

effected at different times, characterized in that at each 
kneading tool (3,4), the assigned crank arm (19) is directly 

pivoted at the upper end of the basic body (17), and that the 
two guide rod means (27) respectively extend outwards from 

their pivoting points on the basic bodies (17) to the respective 
pivoting point (29) on the support (1) so that the 

trajectories of motion of the lower ends of the two kneading 
tools (3,4) overlap each other when seen in the direction of 

the horizontal axes (20). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the two crank arms (19) are mutually offset by 70 to 110°, 

preferably by 90°, relatively to the symmetrical arrangement 
with respect to the vertical plane. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that each guide rod means (27) is pivoted at its kneading tool 

(3,4) within the range of the middle third of the basic body 
(17). 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the pivoting points (28 or 29) of the guide rod 

means (27) on the kneading tool (3 or 4) and/or on the support 
(1) and/or the pivoting point (18) of the kneading tool (3 or 

4) on the crank arm (19) are adjustable.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claim 1 to 4, characterized 
in that each kneading tool (3,4) supports a blade (26) 

formed by a transverse part at its lower end, said blade extending 
unilaterally away from the longitudinal reach of the 

kneading tool (3,4) in perpendicular direction to its longitudinal 
reach, said blades (26) being oriented in the same 

direction. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the two kneading tools (3,4) circulate within the same plane. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the trajectory of motion (30,31) of each blade (26) extends 

from the centre region of the container (7) downwards to 
its bottom (34), then along the bottom (34) up to the lateral 

wall (35) of the container and rising along the same, and 
eventually back again to the centre region of the container 

(7). 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the guide rod means (27) are double guide rods 

engaging both sides of the kneading tool (3 or 4).
