<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor protection component comprising at least two main pairs of Shockley diodes (S1, S2, S3, S4), each pair comprising two diodes in anti-parallel mode which are connected between a front-face metallisation (M1, M2) and a rear-face metallisation (M3), the rear-face metallisation being common to the two pairs of diodes. Each of the diodes (S1, S3) of which the blocking junction corresponds to a separate well on the front face side is associated with at least one auxiliary diode (S7, S8) of the same polarity and with a lower firing threshold, the triggering of which causes that of the other auxiliary diode and of the associated main diodes.
