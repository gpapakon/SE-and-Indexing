<ABSTRACT>
An audio signal is encoded. The signal is first divided into bands (600) for each a band a "yardstick" signal element is selected (608), and its quantized magnitude used for allocating lists, with less accuracy for quantizing non-yardstick signal elements (624) the encoded signal is later decoded (918, 926).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of signal
processing, and more specifically to data encoding and compression. The
invention relates most specifically to a method and an apparatus for the
encoding and compression of digital data representing audio signals or
signals generally having the characteristics of audio signals.Audio signals are ubiquitous. They are transmitted as radio signals
and as part of television signals. Other signals, such as speech, share
pertinent characteristics with audio signals, such as the importance of
spectral domain representations. For many applications, it is beneficial to
store and transmit audio type data encoded in a digital form, rather than in
an analogue form. Such encoded data is stored on various types of digital
media, including compact audio discs, digital audio tape, magnetic disks,
computer memory, both random access (RAM) and read only (ROM), just to
name a few.It is beneficial to minimize the amount of digital data required to
adequately characterize an audio-type analogue signal. Minimizing the
amount of data results in minimizing the amount of physical storage media
that is required, thus reducing the cost and increasing the convenience of
whatever hardware is used in conjunction with the data. Minimizing the
amount of data required to characterize a given temporal portion of an audio
signal also permits faster transmission of a digital representation of the audio
signal over any given communication channel. This also results in a cost
saving, since compressed data representing the same temporal portion of an
audio signal can be sent more quickly, relative to uncompressed data, or can 
be sent over a communications channel having a narrower bandwidth, both
of which consequences are typically less costly.The principles of digital audio signal processing are well known and
set forth in a number of sources, including Watkinson, John, The Art of
Digital Audio., Focal Press, London (1988). An analogue audio signal x(t) is
shown schematically in Fig. 1. The horizontal axis represents time. The
amplitude of the signal at a time t is shown on the vertical axis. The scale of
the time axis is in milliseconds, so approximately two thousandths of a
second of audio signal is represented schematically in Fig. 1. A basic first step
in the storage or transmission of the analogue audio signal as a digital signal
is to sample the signal into discrete signal elements, which will be further
processed.Sampling the signal x(t) is shown schematically in Fig. 2.
