<ABSTRACT>
A radio communication apparatus capable of 
varying the level of its transmission output, comprising 

a receiving circuit, a transmitting circuit, an 
amplifier (14), an extractor, a detector (33), a variable voltage 

converter (40) and a control circuit (21). The receiving circuit 
receives a signal from an opposite station such as a 

base station, and the transmitting circuit transmits a 
signal to the opposite station. The amplifier (14) amplifies 

the output signal obtained from the transmitter, and the 
extractor extracts data from the output signal of the 

receiving circuit so as to control the level of the 
transmission output. The detector (33) detects the level of 

the transmission output obtained from the amplifier (14), and 
the variable voltage converter (40) converts a source voltage 

into the operating voltage of the amplifier. And the 
control circuit (21) produces a control signal to control the 

magnitude of the operating voltage supplied from the 
variable voltage converter (40) to the amplifier in response 

to both the detection signal (V33) from the detector and the 
output signal (V31) from the extractor, and supplies the 

produced control signal (V32) to the variable voltage 
converter. The transmission output obtained from the 

amplifier is varied by changing the operating voltage 
supplied from the variable voltage converter to the 

amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio
communication apparatus and, more particularly, to an
apparatus where the level of its transmission output is
variable.In a duplex mobile telephone system,inclusive
of portable telephones and car telephones such as a
cellular phone system, a base station is capable of
controlling or designating the transmission output level
of a mobile station. The reason is based on the purpose
of suppressing the transmission output of a mobile
station to the minimum value required for the base
station, so as to increase the number of mobile
stations, which can utilize the system, by using the
same channel even in a cell (service area) of the other
base station.In the TACS (Total Access Communication
System), the control or designation of the transmission
output of a mobile station is realized by transmission
of a 3-bit code termed MAC (Mobile Attenuation Code) 
from the base station to the mobile station. An
exemplary construction for controlling the level of a
transmission output in accordance with the MAC will now
be described below with reference to FIG. 1.FIG. 1 shows a portable telephone of analog
cellular system including a mouthpiece 11, an audio
circuit 12, a transmitting circuit 13, a power amplifier
14, a drive stage (former stage) 141 of the amplifier,
an output stage (last stage) 142 of the amplifier, a
duplexer 15, a transmitting/receiving antenna 16, a
receiving circuit 17, and an earpiece 18. In the
amplifier 14, the drive stage 141 performs a class AB
operation, while the output stage 142 performs a class C
operation.When a sound signal from the mouthpiece 11 is
supplied via the audio circuit 12 to the transmitting
circuit 13, it is converted into an up-channel
transmission signal (FM signal) S13. This transmission
signal S13 is supplied to the amplifier 14 and
amplified. Then this transmission signal thus amplified
S13 is supplied via the duplexer 15 to the antenna 16,
from which the signal S13 is transmitted to the base
station. Meanwhile a down-channel transmission signal
from the base station is received at the antenna 16.
The signal thus received is supplied via the duplexer 15
to the receiving circuit 17, so that the sound signal
from the talker is extracted. Thereafter the sound
signal thus extracted is supplied via the audio circuit
12 to the earpiece 18.Denoted by reference numeral 21 is a system
controller which consists of a microcomputer. The
system controller, transmitting circuit 13 and the
receiving circuit 17 are connected to each other via a
mode
