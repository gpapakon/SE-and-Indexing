<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic booster having a valve member (21) 
arranged to operate stably even under a large 

differential pressure. The inside of a housing (1) is 
divided into a constant-pressure chamber (3) and a 

variable-pressure chamber (4) by a diaphragm (2). A 
plunger (15) and a valve member (21) are disposed in a 

valve body (6) supported by the diaphragm such that the 
plunger and the valve member are slidable relative to 

each other. The valve member (21) is formed from a 
rigid reinforcing member (45) and an elastic 

member (45) bonded to the reinforcing member. The 
plunger (15) is movable in association with an input 

shaft (18). The movement of the plunger is transmitted 
to the valve member (21) through a valve spring (22) 

causing the valve member to separate from a seat 
portion (19) provided on the plunger. Thus, compressed 

air is introduced into the variable-pressure 
chamber (4) from a pneumatic device through passages to 

produce differential pressure between the 
variable-pressure chamber (4) and the constant-pressure 

chamber (3), which is supplied with a negative pressure 
from an engine, thereby driving the valve body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic booster used in a
brake system of a vehicle or the like.A known pneumatic booster is provided with a constant-pressure
chamber where a negative pressure constantly acts, and a
variable-pressure chamber whose pressure can be controlled by a
switching operation of a valve. When force is applied to an input shaft
connected to a brake pedal, the valve is actuated, so that the atmospheric
pressure acts on the variable-pressure chamber. Consequently, force is
applied to a diaphragm that divides the constant-pressure chamber and the
variable-pressure chamber, and the force is transmitted to an output
shaft. When the force applied to the input shaft is removed, the valve
allows the constant-pressure chamber and the variable-pressure chamber
to communicate with each other. Thus, the force applied to the output
shaft is cancelled. Such a booster is known from U.S 5,526,729.In the conventional pneumatic booster, the switching valve has a
readily deformable portion and hence suffers from the disadvantage that
when the pressure difference between the constant-pressure chamber and
the variable-pressure is large, air leakage occurs, and thus the desired
operation cannot satisfactorily be performed. This problem is particularly
remarkable in a pneumatic booster of the type in which pressurized air is
supplied to the variable-pressure chamber.In view of the above-described circumstances, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a pneumatic booster which is designed so that
the switching valve is capable of stably operating even under a large
differential pressure.We are aware of DE-A- 38 36 609 which discloses a pneumatic
booster of the type used to form the precharaterising portion of claim 1.
In this document, a booster is disclosed in which a valve member
comprising a rigid integral reinforcing member and a seal member is 
provided where the valve member extends radially outwards from one end
of the cylindrical portion to engage with a valve seat.To this end, the present invention provides
a pneumatic booster, comprising:a housing defining a space therein;a diaphragm dividing said space inside said housing into a constant-pressure
chamber and a variable-pressure chamber;a valve body hermetically attached to said diaphragm and having a
first passage communicating said constant-pressure chamber with said
variable-pressure chamber;a plunger slidably fitted in said valve body so as to be movable in
response to movement of an input shaft;a second passage having a
