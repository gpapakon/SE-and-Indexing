<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a commercial vehicle, in particular a forward-control lorry with pneumatic suspension, having a leading or trailing axle (twin axle) (9 and 10), which is assigned to a rear axle (6) and can be transferred, by a hydraulic or pneumatic lifting device, into a lowered position in which the wheels (11 and 12) are in contact with the carriageway, or into a lifting position in which the wheels (11 and 12) are not in contact with the carriageway, characterised in that the wheels (11 and 12) of the leading or trailing axle (9 and 10) have a considerably smaller tyre outside diameter than the wheels (8) of the adjacent rear axle (6). So as to be able to lower the loading area or lowest plane (13) of the vehicle body (4) as far as possible, but nevertheless to ensure that the leading and trailing axle (9 and 10) has an adequately high lift, the invention proposes fitting the wheels (11 and 12) of the leading or trailing axle (9 and 10) with tyres which have a considerably smaller outer diameter than those of the wheels (8) of the adjacent rear axle (6). This reduction in the diameter of the tyres results in a series of functional and manufacturing advantages in the vehicle.
