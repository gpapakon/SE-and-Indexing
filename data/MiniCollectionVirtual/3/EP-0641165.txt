<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cooking ovens
and more particularly to such an oven which cooks utilizing
steam at a reduced pressure as the heating medium.
Further, the invention relates
to methods of preparing food products by use of such ovens.There are a wide variety of known cooking techniques and
there has been, within each, a great deal of experimentation
with the several variables associated with such cooking
techniques. For example, the use of steam as a heat transfer
medium is well known. Such steam cooking devices may employ
the steam at atmospheric pressure as in U.S. Patent 4,011,805
with convection heat transfer. Steam as the heat transfer
medium at substantially atmospheric pressure with forced
convection heat transfer is also known in U.S. Patent
4,173,215. In this last patented arrangement, water is
introduced into the bottom of a steam chamber and a heat
source outside that chamber heats that water to produce steam.
The chamber is vented so as to maintain the pressure within
the cooking vessel at substantially atmospheric pressure.
Such steam cooking devices may employ the steam at an elevated
pressure as in the common "pressure cooker." U.S. Patent
3,800,778 discloses a steam cooker with a valve and pump
arrangement so that the pressure within the cooking vessel can
be maintained either above or below atmospheric pressure. The
stated reason for cooking below atmospheric pressure is to
cook at a reduced temperature so that delicate foods will not
be overcooked and their vitamins lost. U.S. Patent 3,223,021
employs this same general concept in a coffee roasting oven
which operates below atmospheric pressure for a period of time
and then has its internal pressure increased. The coffee in 
this roasting oven is cooled after roasting and before the
pressure is released. Finally, the concept of a food holding
cabinet is old and disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent
4,623,780. This patent points out that it is difficult to
maintain precooked food at a preferred serving temperature
while maintaining its moisture content. The patent suggests
food storage at a temperature below its cooking temperature
and in a steam atmosphere to maintain crust crispness, for
example, with fried chicken, while minimizing moisture loss.There has been a significant amount of research into
eating habits as they relate to health. For example, in the
article PREVENTION OF FORMATION OF IMPORTANT
MUTAGENS/CARCINOGENS IN THE HUMAN FOOD CHAIN by Weisburger and
Jones, it is pointed out that during cooking

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a food product within a vessel
comprising the steps of removing the air from the vessel and

reducing the ambient pressure surrounding the food product,
allowing steam to surround the food product for a

predetermined period of time to cook the food product
wherein the step of allowing steam to surround the food

product includes boiling water in the range of 71 to 77째C
(one-hundred sixty to one-hundred seventy degrees fahrenheit)

in the reduced ambient pressure, and reintroducing air
into the vessel to reduce the rate of heat transfer to the

food product and maintaining the food product at a preferred
temperature without further cooking wherein the effective

heat transfer rate to the food product is substantially
greater during said predetermined period of time and is

significantly reduced upon reintroduction of the air with
the water temperature being maintained in the range of 71

to 77째C (one-hundred sixty to one-hundred seventy degrees
fahrenheit) after restoration to atmospheric pressure.
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of allowing steam
to surround the food product includes enclosing the food

product within a non-hermetic vessel whereby heat transfer
is from the steam to the vessel and then from the vessel by

a combination of conduction and convection to the food
product whereby the food product is protected from becoming

too moist from direct exposure to the steam. 
A cooking and holding food preparation unit comprising a
food receiving compartment (20), the compartment including a

door (28) and a gasket (11) for hermetically sealing the
compartment (20) when the door (28) is closed; a liquid

receiving open-topped tray (13) near the bottom of the
compartment (20); means (18) for heating a liquid in the

tray (13); thermostat control means (16) coupled to the
compartment (20) and to the means (18) for heating for

maintaining the temperature of the compartment (20) at an
operator selected temperature; a pump (12) for selectively

reducing the air pressure within the compartment (20);
a vacuum release valve (14) selectively coupling the

compartment (20) to the exterior atmosphere; and a timer
(24) for measuring elapsed time after cooking is begun and

for converting the food preparation unit into its hold
cycle and opening the vacuum release valve (14) upon the

expiration of an operator determined time interval, the
thermostat control means (16) coupled to the means (18) for

heating maintaining the temperature of the compartment (20)
at the operator selected temperature.
The cooking and holding food preparation unit of claim 3
further comprising a start control (19) for initiating

operation of the thermostat control means (16) and the
timer (24), the thermostat control means (16) and timer (24)

otherwise operating independently of one another.
The cooking and holding food preparation unit of claim 3
further comprising a manually operable drain valve (26) near

the lowermost portion of the tray (13).
The cooking and holding food preparation unit of claim 3
further comprising a plurality of food receiving racks (21,

23, 25) supported in stacked relationship within the
compartment (20), and a grease catching pan (38, 40)

interposed between the lowermost of the racks (21, 23, 25)
and the tray (13). 
The cooking and holding food preparation unit of claim 3
wherein operation of the means (18) for heating continues

long after the opening of the vacuum release valve (14).
The cooking and holding food preparation unit of claim 3
further comprising a moisture collection pan (37), the pump

(12) having an inlet (33) located near the top of the
compartment (20) and an outlet (35) terminating immediately

above the moisture collection pan (37).
