<ABSTRACT>
The invention disclosed relates to novel branched 
chain hydroxy terminated aliphatic azido polymers and 

copolymers, and to a single step process for their 
production. The properties of the materials are 

preferably adjusted through the incorporation of 
suitable polyols which can provide additional 

branching of the materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for 
making branched-chain aliphatic azido ether polymers 
and copolymers, and to the novel polymers and 
copolymers produced by the process. Solid high-energy compositions, such as 
propellants, explosives, gasifiers, or the like, 
typically comprise solid particulates such as fuel 
particulates and/or oxidizer particulates dispersed and 
immobilized throughout a binder matrix comprising an 
elastomeric polymer. Binders previously used in composite solid 
propellant formulations have generally been non-energetic 
polymers such as polycaprolactones, 
polyethyleneglycols or polybutadienes. There is 
continuing interest in this field to develop suitable 
binders which are energetic, and which have 
satisfactory mechanical properties. Development of 
these improved energetic binders is of interest in this 
area in order to provide safer binders which can 
provide higher energy levels and/or increase the 
specific impulse in a propellant formulation. A number of materials have been suggested as 
energetic binders, including for example, poly(glycidyl 
nitrate), described, for example in European Patent 
publication EP-0,485,099-A1 published May 13, 1992, 
nitrocellulose, or poly(oxetanes). Further, alternative 
composite materials have been used which consist of  
 
non-energetic binders and energetic materials such as 
nitroglycerine, butanetriol trinitrate and the like. 
However, there remains a need to develop improved 
materials for these applications, and for improved 
processes for producing these materials. A further group of energetic materials which are 
of interest in the present application, are glycidyl 
azide polymers (GAP) and in particular, branched-chain 
aliphatic azido ether polymers and copolymers. These 
materials are potentially useful as binders in 
energetic formulations, such as rocket and gun 
propellants, composite explosives and pyrotechnics. Linear hydroxy-terminated aliphatic polyethers 
having azido alkyl substituents, e.g. GAP, and a 
process for producing GAP are described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,268,450, issued May 19, 1981. In this patent, 
epichlorohydrin (ECH), as a starting material, is 
polymerized to polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) using a 
catalyst, such as boron trifluoride (BF₃), in the 
presence of a dichloro compound such as 
dichloromethane. In a second reaction step, PECH is 
azidized using a molar excess of sodium azide in the 
presence of a polar organic solvent such as dimethyl 
formamide (DMF). A final purification step
