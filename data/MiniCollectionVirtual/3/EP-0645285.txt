<ABSTRACT>
A method of synchronising two control devices is characterised by the following:   a) in the synchronised state the first control device transmits an item of raw information to the second control device and the second control device transmits back to the first control device an item of test information acquired from the said raw information b) the first control device produces an enabling signal when there is correspondence between the transmitted-back test information and the expected test information c) when at least one of the two control devices is first activated the said control device supplies an item of characteristic information which differs from other information which is output and d) a renewed exchange of information cannot be initiated until a prescribed period of time has elapsed.

<CLAIMS>
An antitheft method for vehicles with two control devices which 
exchange information, characterised by the following steps of the 

method: 

a) in a synchronised state the first control device provides raw 
information to the second control device and the second control 

device returns check information derived therefrom to the first control 
device; 
b) the first control device generates a release signal if the returned check 
information corresponds to the expected check information; 
c) upon start-up for the first time at least one of the two control devices 
delivers a characteristic information which differs from the other 

output information; and 
d) a renewed information exchange can only be initiated after the elapse 
of a pre-determined time period. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the initialisation 
of the renewed information exchange is carried out automatically. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that upon each 
attempt at initialisation before elapse of the pre-determined time 

period, the time required for carrying out the new information 
exchange is extended relative to the pre-determined time period.
