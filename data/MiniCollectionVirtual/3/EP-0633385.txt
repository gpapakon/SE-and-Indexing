<ABSTRACT>
An expandable and contractible tubular cell window 
covering (20) includes a plurality of contiguous cells (24) which have 

been bonded together to form a wavy or undulating pattern 
along the length of the cells. The undulating or wavy 

patterns can be created by initially stretching the cells 
before bonding adjacent cells and subsequently releasing the 

stretch so that the fibres engaged with the bonding medium 
remain in a stretched or separated condition while the 

remaining fibres are relaxed. The cells can also be bonded 
with an adhesive that expands on curing to create the same 

effect without having the pre-stretch the fabric before 
applying the bonding medium. In a third embodiment of the 

invention, adjacent tubular cells are bonded together with 
curved lines of adhesive which again create an undulating or 

wavy configuration along the length of each tubular cell. 
The methods for forming the window covering is also 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to expandable 
and collapsible window coverings comprised of a plurality 
of contiguous tubular cells and more particularly to such 
a window covering wherein the tubular cells are bonded to 
adjacent cells to form undulations along the length of the 
cells. Window coverings formed from a plurality of 
collapsible contiguous tubular cells have acquired 
considerable desirability in recent years. The window 
coverings are desirable both from a utilitarian and 
aesthetic standpoint. From a utilitarian standpoint, air 
within each of the cells circulates only minimally such 
that when the shade is expanded so as to cover the window 
opening in which it is mounted, the covering provides good 
thermal insulation. From an aesthetic standpoint, since 
such window coverings are typically made of soft fabrics, 
they provide a softer appearance than conventional venetian 
blinds or minishades. Window coverings made out of contiguous tubular cells 
are sometimes referred to as honeycomb panel window 
coverings and the tubular cells may extend horizontally or 
vertically depending upon the desired aesthetic appearance. 
There are various prior art disclosures relating to window 
coverings of the tubular cell type with the following being 
illustrative: U.S. Patent No. 4,347,887 to Brown shows a "Thermal 
Shutter." A wide band of material is folded transversely 
to form a double column of adjacent cells, which may have 
rounded visible contours. The cells are adhesively bonded 
to one another. The Brown structure is symmetrical, so  
 
that both sides of the shade thus formed have essentially 
the same appearance. U.S. Patent No. 4,450,027 to Colson shows a method and 
apparatus for fabricating a multiple cell shade wherein a 
continuous relatively narrow strip of fabric is folded 
longitudinally in order to define pleats in the shade 
material and the edges folded over on the center portion to 
create a tubular cell. Successive cells are assembled by 
applying an adhesive to folded-over edges of the cells and 
adhering each cell to the preceding cell when wound on a 
stacking rack. U.S. Patent No. 4,631,217 to Anderson shows in 
Figure 3 a shade of asymmetrical construction. A rear wall 
section of each cell is essentially straight or linear when 
the shade is in its expanded position. The width of these 
wall sections thus define the spacing of the adjacent 
cells, while the front of each cell, containing more 
material, presents a pleaded outward appearance. The

An expandable and collapsible window covering 
comprising a plurality of elongated, transversely 

collapsible tubular cells bonded together longitudinally by 
at least one line of adhesive which extends along an 
area of 
engagement between adjacent cells, characterised in that 

said tubular cells undulate along their length. 
A window covering according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said line of adhesive is substantially 

sinusoidal in configuration. 
A window covering according to claim 2, 
characterised in that there are two lines of adhesive and 

each is substantially sinusoidal in configuration. 
A window covering according to claim 3, 
characterised in that said lines of adhesive extend in 

adjacent relationship and are substantially in phase with 
each other. 
A window covering according to claim 3, 
characterised in that said lines of adhesive are out of 

phase with each other. 
A window covering according to claim 5, 
characterised in that said lines of adhesive are 180° out of 

phase with each other. 
A window covering according to any one of claims 3 
to 6, characterised in that corresponding lines of adhesive 

which are separated by a tubular cell are approximately 180° 
out of phase. 
A window covering according to any one of claims 3 
to 6, characterised in that corresponding lines of adhesive

A window covering according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that said tubular cells are made of 

fabric having fibres with a uniform construction pattern and

adhesive are spaced a greater distance than the fibres which 
are not along said lines of adhesive.
