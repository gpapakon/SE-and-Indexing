<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a luminescent optical indicator, for determining the activity of alkali metals on the basis of decay time measurement, provision is made for the indicator to have at least three components chemically bonded together, namely a fluorophore, a functional group by means of which the luminescence decay time of the fluorophore can be influenced, and an ionophore which selectively and reversibly binds the alkali metal ions to be measured, by means of which the action of the functional group on the decay time of the fluorophore can be altered as a function of the activity of the alkali metal ions.

of alkali metal ions in a sample solution, the said solution 

being at least in indirect contact with the indicator, 
wherein
 
the indicator has at least three components that are chemically 

bound to one another, i.e., a fluorophor, a functional group with 
which the luminescence decay time of the fluorophor can be 

influenced, and a ionophor selectively and reversibly binding the
