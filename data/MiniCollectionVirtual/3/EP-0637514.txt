<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a laser marking 
method which comprises coating a laser marking 

composition containing as essential components a color 
former, a color developer and an inorganic compound 

having the absorption peak on the infrared absorption 
spectrum in the region of 900-1,000 cm⁻¹ on a substrate 

to form a color developing layer, and irradiating laser 
light to the color developing layer; the laser marking 

composition; and articles having a color developing 
layer made of the laser marking composition. The method 

of this invention is capable of forming a mark with 
vivid color development even when the color developing 

layer is a thin film of less than 5 µm in thickness or 
when marking is carried out at high speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser 
marking method 
and a use of a composition as 
a laser marking composition. A thermosensitive recording medium designed to 
form a color image by melting and contacting a color 
former with a developer and making use of a color 
reaction by the two substances is known. For carrying 
out recording with such a thermosensitive recording 
medium, a recording system is generally employed in 
which the recording medium is run with its color 
developing layer in close attachment with a recording 
head (thermal head) having a heat generating element. 
In operation of such recording system, however, there 
are involved various problems such as wear of the head, 
adhesion of tailings to the head surface and sticking of 
the head with the color developing layer of the 
recording medium. Further, since the recording speed 
depends on the heat dissipation time of the thermal 
head, it is hardly possible to carry out high-speed 
printing and also there is a limitation to the  
 
resolution of the color image formed by diffusion of 
heat. Recently, for real-time marking of letters and 
signs such as maker's name, product name, date of 
production, lot number, etc., on the surfaces of various 
commercial articles, for example, electronic parts such 
as IC's, resistors, condensers, inductors, etc., 
electrical parts such as relays, switches, connectors, 
printed circuit boards, etc., housings of the electrical 
devices, automobile parts, machine parts, cables, 
sheets, packaging sheets, cards, various containers of 
foods and medicines, caps of containers, etc., the laser 
marking system is popularly employed for its various 
advantages such as high speed printing, capability of 
fine marking, etc. Such laser marking system is 
essentially based on the principle that marking is made 
by breaking, that is, laser light is applied to the 
necessary part alone of the substrate surface to cause 
denaturing or removal of said part of the substrate, or 
laser light is applied to the coating film formed on the 
substrate surface to remove the coating film alone, so 
as to produce a contrast between the laser irradiated 
portion and the non-irradiated portion of the substrate. When this laser marking method is applied to 
said color former and developer combination system, it 
may happen that break takes place even in the substrate 
to make it unable to perform desired marking. Also, 
when it is tried to lower the laser energy so as to  
 
prevent undesired break of the color developing
