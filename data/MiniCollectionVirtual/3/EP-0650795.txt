<ABSTRACT>
High melting temperature Pb/Sn 95/5 solder balls (18) are 
connected to copper pads on the bottom of a ceramic chip 

carrier substrate (10) by low melting temperature eutectic 
Pb/Sn solder. The connection is made by quick reflow to 

prevent dissolving Pb into the eutectic solder and raising its 
melting temperature. Then the module is placed on a 

fiberglass-epoxy circuit board with the solder balls on 
eutectic Pb/Sn solder bumps on copper pads of the board. The 

structure is reflowed to simultaneously melt the solder on 
both sides of the balls to allow each ball to center between 

the carrier pad and circuit board pad to form a more symmetric 
joint. This process results in structure that are more 

reliable under high temperature cycling. Also, to further 
improve reliability, the balls are made as large as the I/O 

spacing allows without bridging beam on balls; the two pads 
are about the same size with more solder on the smaller pad; 

the pads are at least 75% of the ball diameter; and the 
eutectic joints are made as large as possible without bridging 

between pads. For reliability at even higher temperature 
cycles or larger substrate sizes columns are used instead of 

balls.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surface mount solder connections
using HMT (high melting temperature) metal-balls between a
grid of contacts on a component and a mirror image array of
contacts of an electrical interconnect structure and more
specifically to the composition of the HMT solder balls and
LMT (low melting temperature) solder joining the balls to
the contacts, the specific geometry of the connections, FR-4
(glass and epoxy) circuit boards and MLC (multi-layer
ceramic) chip carriers for such interconnections, the
processes for producing the boards and carriers, and the
process for attaching the carriers to the boards.Solder-ball connections have been used for mounting ICs
(integrated computer chips) using the C-4 (controlled
collapse chip connection) technology since first described
in U.S. patents 3,401,126 and 3,429,040 by Miller.
Packaging Electronic Systems by Dally ( McGraw-Hill 1990 p.
113) describes flip chip or C-4 connections. In Dally,
"Chip bond pads are deployed in an area array over the
surface of the chip. ... These bonding pads are 5 mil in
diameter on 10 mil centers. Matching bonding pads are
produced on a ceramic substrate so that the pads on the
chip and the ceramic coincide. Spheres of solder 5 mil in
diameter are placed on the ceramic substrate pads ... and 
the chip is positioned and aligned relative to the
substrate. The assembly is heated until the solder spheres
begin to soften and a controlled collapse of the sphere
takes place as the solder simultaneously wets both pads. A
myriad of solder structures have been proposed for mounting
IC chips as well as for interconnection to other levels of
circuitry and electronic packaging.""Ball Grid Arrays: The Hot New Package" by Terry Costlow
and "Solder Balls Make Connections" by Glenda Derman both
in Electronic Engineering Times March 15, 1993, describe
using solder balls to connect ceramic or flexible chip
carriers to circuit boards.U. S. patent 4,132,341 to Bratschum describes the self-centering
action of conductors spanning between solder pads
of two components when both pads are simultaneously
reflowed. U.S. patent 4,831,724 describes the self-centering
of a component when it is vibrated during reflow.Fabrication of multi-layer ceramic chip carriers is
described in U.S. patents 3,518,756; 3,988,405; and
4,202,007 as well as "A Fabrication Technique For MultiLayer
Ceramic Modules" by H.D. Kaiser et al., Solid State
Technology, May 1972, pp. 35-40 and "The Third Dimension

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an interconnect assembly
comprising the steps of:


producing a first substrate (10) with an approximately
plana pattern of multiple, metal contacts (12) on a

major surface;
depositing a volume of a first joining-material
(16) on each of the contacts of the first

substrate;
connecting a conductive metal-ball (18) to the
first joining-material on each of the contacts on

the first substrate to define a plane of
metal-balls for maintaining a predetermined

distance between the first substrate and a second
substrate when connected;
producing a second substrate (11) with a major
surface having an approximately planar pattern of

multiple, metal contacts which are approximately a
mirror image of the pattern of contacts of the

first substrate;
depositing a volume of a second joining-material
(13) for positioning between the metal-balls and

each respective contact of the second substrate;
positioning the substrates together for
interconnection with contact patterns parallel,

with mirror image pairs of contacts in confronting
approximate alignment, and with each volume of the

second joining-material approximately in contact
with a respective metal-ball and a respective

contact of the second substrate; and 
simultaneously melting the first and second
joining-materials while the substrates are

positioned together, at a temperature in which the
metal-balls remain solid for providing the

predetermined separation between substrates,
for moving the metal-balls by surface tension of

the melted joining-material in directions within
the plane of the joining metal-balls to positions

approximately between the pairs of approximately
aligned contacts;
cooling the substrates below the melting
temperatures of the joining-materials to form

electrical interconnections between the pairs of
contacts.
The process of claim 1, in which the step of connecting
a metal-ball (18) to the first volumes of

joining-material (16) includes the steps of:

positioning a metal-ball (18) on each volume of first
joining-material (16);
heating the first substrate (10) up to connect the
metal-balls to the contacts (12) of the first substrate (10)

by melting the first joining-material (16) without
melting the metal-ball (18) ; and
cooling the first substrate (10) down to form a
mechanical joint between the metal-balls (18) and the

contacts (12) of the first substrate (10) before the step of
positioning the substrates (10, 11) together for

interconnection.
The process of claim 2, in which there is a metal
element which can migrate between the metal-balls and

the first joining-material and increase the melting
temperature of the first joining-material and during the

step of heating the first substrate up the substrate is
heated to a minimum temperature and for a minimum time

for minimizing migration of a metal elements between the
metal-balls and first joining-material to minimize the

increase of the melting temperature of the first
joining-material.
The process of claim 3, further comprising the step,
selecting a different joining-material for the first and

second joining-materials for compensating for migration
of the metal element between the metal-balls and first

joining-material in order for the first and second
joining-materials to simultaneously melt during the step

of heating the substrates up while positioned together.
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
in that
 metal-columns (165, 171) are used instead of
metal-balls.
