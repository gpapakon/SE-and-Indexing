<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing aluminium hydride (alane, AlH3) by reaction of magnesium hydride with aluminium halide in the presence of solvents, characterised in that the magnesium hydride used is obtainable by reaction of magnesium with hydrogen at a temperature of 
>
/= 250 DEG C and a pressure of from 0.5 to 5 MPa with the proviso that the magnesium to be hydrogenated has added to it, prior to the hydrogenation, magnesium hydride having a particle size of 
<
/= 400 mu m in amounts of at least 1.2 % by weight, based on magnesium to be hydrogenated, and the reaction is carried out with continual milling of the reaction products MgH2 and AlX3 (X = halogen) in a molar ratio of at least 3 : 2 in 1,4-dioxane within a temperature range from 20 DEG to 110 DEG C over a period of from 30 minutes to 5 hours.

Process for preparing aluminium hydride (AlH
3
) by 
reacting magnesium hydride with aluminium halide in the 

presence of solvents, characterized in that the magnesium 
hydride used is obtainable by reacting magnesium with 

hydrogen at a temperature of ≧ 250°C and a pressure of 
from 0.5 to 5 MPa with the proviso that magnesium hydride 

having a particle size of ≦ 400 µm is added prior to the 
hydrogenation to the magnesium to be hydrogenated in 

amounts of at least 1.2 % by weight, based on magnesium 
to be hydrogenated, and in that the reaction is carried 

out with continual milling of the reaction products MgH

and AlX
3
 (X = halogen) in a molar ratio of at least 3:2 
in 1,4-dioxane within a temperature range from 20° to 

110°C over a period of from 30 minutes to 5 hours. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the reaction is carried out within a temperature 

range from 40° to 100°C.
