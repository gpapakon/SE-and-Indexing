<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEIN COMPOUND CAPABLE OF INHIBITING TUMORAL GROWTHThis invention relates to a substantially proteic com¬ position which is capable of inhibiting selectively the div- ision of tu oral cells sensitive to estrogens and/or of exerting a cytotoxic activity on said cells. This invention also relates to a cell line isolated from a human Hposarcoma capable of dividing in a culture, which line produces said- composition, as well as to its culture conditioned medium in which- said composition is present.This invention is also concerned with the employments of said products in diagnostic and in clinical applications.A large number of, cell lines capable of growing n vitro and originally isolated from human- tumors are already known from the prior art. Such lines are particularly useful for th study of their biochemical and physiological properties, as well as for the production of specific factors".In spite of the large number of attempts made up to the present time, no cell lines are known from the Drior art whic have a differentiated phenotype that can be associated to tha of the adipose cells or adipocytes, and no lines are known which are isolated from tumors belonging to the class of lipo sarco as. Such cells would be particularly useful as they derive from the stromal tissue, a tissue which at the present time has been very little characterized and for which a con¬ trolling role has been suggested as regards some of the func¬ tions performed by the adjacent tissues. Indeed, in vivo, in the mammary gland in the presence of the hormone testostero¬ ne, adipose cells induce the regression of epithelial tissue [Kratochwill , . Development and loss of androgen responsive¬ ness in the embryonic rudiment of the mouse mammary gland. 

Dev. Biol. 61: 358-365, 1977] so exerting paracrine action which possibly is mediated by one or more compounds released by said adipose cells [Kratochwill, K. 1987, in "Cellular and Molecular Biology of Mammary Cancer" (D. Medina, . Kidwell, G. Heppner, e E. Anderson, eds.), pp. 1-8 Plenum, New York]. The investigations mentioned above put particularly into evidence the need for isolating and growing in vitro a cell line capable of performing the functions observed in vivo.The Author of this invention has isolated and character- ized for the first time a cell line which is capable of div¬ iding in a culture, with a phenotype associable with that of adipose cells. Surprisingly, the cell line produces in the culture medium, denominated as conditioned medium, at least one compound that
