<ABSTRACT>
A wheel (1) for use on a potentially vulnerable surface such as grass on a golf course, includes a sleeve (12) of elastomeric material having a plurality of projections in the form of teeth (16) on each peripheral edge thereof, the teeth on one edge being independently movable with respect to the teeth on the opposing edge, thereby to provide differential movement therebetween upon a directional change in the path of the wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO WHEELS This invention concerns improvements in or relating to wheels.In particular, the present invention has reference to such wheels employed on vehicles for the purpose of reducing the loading per unit area, thereby to minimise the damage to the supporting surface through frictional and mechanical contact therewith, especially when turning.The wheel of the present invention has particular but not exclusive application to a vehicle intended to be driven on a sensitive and easily damaged surface, for example, the grass of a golf course. One of the problems attendant upon the use of conventional wheels with pneumatic tyres on golf carts is that of changing direction, especially when moving on wet or heavy grass. The act of turning the wheel occasions damage to the grass and causes ruts and general surface disruption.There have been various proposals for attempting to achieve the same objective and one particular idea involves the use of a plurality of ground engaging pads connected to and laterally across the tread of a pneumatic tyre in such a manner that the pads are rotatable about radial axes relative to the tyre. This arrangement purports to allow the tyre to move through a small angular movement whilst the pad or pads currently in contact with the ground remain in such contact until the wheel has rotated through a sufficient angle to bring the relevant pad or pads out of contact with the ground, the pad or pads returning to their normal position by virtue of resilient loading. The whole 

of the pad across its full width moves in unison, and thus, when one extremity moves in a particular direction, the other moves in the opposite direction to the same extent. A serious drawback to that idea resides in its relative inflexibility and complexity, not only in use, but also and perhaps more especially, in manufacture.An object of the present invention is to provide an improved wheel of simplified form but capable of spreading the wheel loading to avoid damaging a supporting surface.According to the invention, there is provided a wheel including a plurality of spaced apart projections extending laterially and circumferentially of the wheel in such manner as, in use, sequentially to provide areas for contact, with a supporting surface, wherein the projections are provided on or integrally with a sleeve secured directly to the wheel to afford differential movement between each side of the wheel.The sleeve may conveniently be in the form of a track securable to the periphery

 CLAIMS :
1. A wheel including a plurality of spaced apart projections extending laterially and circumferentially of the wheel in such manner as, in use, sequentially to provide areas for contact with a supporting surface, wherein the projections are provided on or integrally with a sleeve secured directly to the wheel to afford differential movement between each side of the wheel.
2. A wheel according to Claim 1, in which the sleeve is in the form of a track securable to the periphery of the wheel.
3. A wheel according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which the wheel includes a hub carrying a tyre, the sleeve being securable to the tyre.
4. A wheel according to Claim 1, in which the sleeve is in the form of a cage mountable on the wheel.
5. A wheel according to Claim 1, in which the sleeve is annular or formable into an annular shape to circumscribe the wheel.
6. A wheel according to any preceding claim, in which the projections are of elastomeric material.
7. A wheel according to Claim 6, in which the elastomeric material is a laminated structure.
A wheel according to any preceding 


claim, in which the projections are in the form of teeth equisapced around the periphery of the wheel.
9. A wheel according to Claim 8, in which the spaces between the teeth are of constant or varying cross section.
10. A wheel substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the accompanying drawings.
11. A vehicle comprising one or more wheels as defined in any preceding claim.
