<ABSTRACT>
A food package (10) including a package body forming a food receiving 
cavity (14) for 

storing and heating a food item (12) in a microwave oven. Specifically, 
the package body includes a bottom panel (20) and 

a top panel (16) with side panels (18) 
joining the bottom and top panel. An impedance matching element (22) is provided 

on at least one of the panels for impedance matching microwave energy 
entering the package. The impedance matching element is preferably a 

contiguous film of thinly flaked material embedded in a dielectric binder which 
is sized and shaped with respect to the food to cause impedance matching to 

elevate the temperature of the food in predetermined areas dependent upon the 
size and spacing of the film without interacting with the microwave energy to 

produce heat. The film may also be shaped in the form of a convex lens to 
direct impedance matched microwave energy toward the food to elevate the 

temperature of the food in a predetermined area. Further, the flake material 
may be present in the binder in an amount sufficient to provide microwave 

shielding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microwave cooking of a food item. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a package for storing and microwave heating food
according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method for producing such a package.The popularity of microwave ovens for cooking all or a part of a meal has led to the
development of a large number of food packages capable of cooking a food item in a
microwave oven directly in the food package in which it is stored. The convenience
of cooking food in its own package or a component thereof appeals to a large number
of consumers. However, one dissatisfaction of microwave cooking for some foods
is the inability to heat or warm the center of the food without burning or severely dehydrating
the exterior thereof. In particular, larger servings are very difficult to heat
uniformly using conventional food packages in a microwave oven. Even when the
outer portions are thoroughly cooked, the center is generally undesirably cool.Microwave interactive films have been produced which are capable of generating
heat at the food surface to crispen some food products. US - A - 4,641,005 discloses a
microwave interactive material useful in food packaging which is capable of browning
the surface of a food item. Specifically, the interactive material includes a very
thin metal film applied to a polymer material which is adhered to a rigid substrate.
Such a film actually interacts with microwave energy to produce heat at the surface
of the food. The heat provided by such an interactive material is advantageous for
browning the surface of a food item, but is not advantageous for cooking a thick
food item having a large dielectric constant because the outer portion of the food will
cook even faster than without interactive material resulting in a deficiently heated inner
portion.Additional microwave heating devices have also been developed primarily for use in
food packaging. US - A - 4,876,423 discloses a medium for producing localized
microwave radiation heating wherein the medium is formed from a mixture of polymeric
binder and conductive and semiconductive particles that can be coated or printed
on a substrate. Again, however, such a medium is designed to interact with the
electromagnetic, microwave energy to produce heat and thereby, brown or crispen
the surface of a food item, while providing no enhanced heating of the center of the
food. A number of microwave food packages or containers have also been developed
which are designed to uniformly heat or adjust
