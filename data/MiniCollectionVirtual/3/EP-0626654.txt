<ABSTRACT>
Horizontal edges, vertical edges, symmetrical axes, T-shaped 
edges, +-shaped edges, L-shaped edges, □-shaped 

eges, part of a preceding vehicle and the like are extracted 
as a vehicle characteristic in images picked up from two 

video cameras mounted to a vehicle, and a disaprity is 
determined by utilizing of the correspondece relationship of 

the exracted vehicle characteristic, thereby measuring a 
distance to the preceding vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
measuring intervehicle distance. Conventional distance measuring apparatus using stereo 
vision include an apparatus disclosed by A. Grumet in 
U.S.Pat. No. 4,601,053. In the patent, A. Grumet describes 
the apparatus in which part of an object to be measured is 
set as a reference in one of two images obtained by two view 
points having a spacing between them in the horizontal 
direction, and searching a horizontal brightness arrangement 
similar to the reference in the other image causes a 
disparity as a shift in the horizontal direction to be 
determined, whereby a distance to the object is calculated by 
the determined disparity. However, such conventional distance measuring apparatus 
have performed a processing using only brightness 
information, so that it has been difficult to set and limit  
 
a reference to a preceding vehicle, which reference is 
required for measuring intervehicle distance. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus for measuring intervehicle distance, by which a 
reference on a preceding vehicle essential for the 
intervehicle distance measurement using stereo vision is 
provided in an image, thereby allowing a distance to the 
preceding vehicle to be positively measured. An intervehicle distance measuring apparatus of the 
present invention has:
 
   image memories for storing right/left or upper/lower 
imagas picked up from image pick-up means for picking up a 
preceding vehicle,
 
   a vehicle characteristic extraction section for 
extracting a vehicle characteristic from the respective 
images stored in the image memories,
 
   a correspondence searching section for determining a 
correspondence relationship between these images of the 
extracted vehicle characteristic,
 
   a disparity calculation section for determining a 
disparity as a shift between these images , of the vehicle  
 
characteristic determined for correspondence relationship, 
and
 
   a distance calculation section for calculating a 
distance to the preceding car by a use of the determined 
disparity. Fig.1 is a block diagram showing the basic composition 
of an intervehicle distance measuring apparatus of one 
embodiment according to the present invention. Fig.2 is a sketch view showing an example of 
installation of video cameras to a vehicle. Fig.3 is a flowchart of the operation of the same 
intervehicle distance measuring apparatus. Fig.4 is an illustrative view showing stereo images 
picked up by the video cameras of the
