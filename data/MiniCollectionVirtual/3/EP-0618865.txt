<ABSTRACT>
A device for stapling superposed printed products laid on a conveyor (8) with successive spaced supports (4), leads past a stapling machine (5) with a plurality of rotating stapling heads (10) operating in synchronism with the supports (4), whereby the rotary paths (13, 14) of the oppositely arranged stapling heads (10) and the supports (4) form a common section (B, D) in the region where they are closest together on which the stapling heads (10) or the supports (4) are deflected from the predetermined rotary path (13, 14).

Device for stapling superposed printed products of the leaf type 
laid on spaced successive supports (4) of a rotary conveyer (8) 

which are externally guided along by a stapling machine (5) 
which comprises at least one approximately circular peripheral 

stapling head (10) which co-operates with the supports (4), and 
that during stapling each stapling head (10) is driven jointly with 

the supports (4), 
characterised in that
 the peripheral paths 
(13, 14) of the stapling head(s) (10) and the supports (4) have in 

the area of closest nearness a joint path section (B) on which 
the peripheral path (14) of the stapling head(s) (10) is arranged 

by a movement control, which is driven by the guide paths, of 
the stapling heads (10) to extend parallel to the peripheral path 

(13) of the supports (4). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the joint 
path section (B) is arranged on an at least partially circular area 

of the peripheral track (13) of the supports (4). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
joint path section (B) is respectively arranged on both sides of a 

plane which connects the rotary axes (11, 6) of the at least 
partially circular peripheral paths (14, 13) of the stapling head(s) 

(10) and the supports (4). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 
the stapling head(s) (10) and/or the supports or their associated 

bending mechanisms (9) are mounted on driven notches (15). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
the distance between a support (4) and a thereto associated 

stapling head (10) or its peripheral paths (13, 14) is adjustable.
