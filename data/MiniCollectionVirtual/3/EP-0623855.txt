<ABSTRACT>
Labels are printed from a liquid ink having mineral oil by printing on a sheet 
having a Teslin brand synthetic paper lamination followed by an organic 

adhesive lamination in contact with the synthetic paper, followed by a 
supporting lamination. The synthetic paper can be as thin as 8 ml and no 

barrier layer is needed to protect the adhesive from the mineral oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printing on labels using liquid toner or ink having
mineral oil. The labels have an outer lamination which receives the printing, a
layer for support during printing, and a intermediate adhesive layer so that the
printed label can be peeled from the support layer and affixed by the adhesive
to ordinary surfaces.This invention is a label having no barrier layer between the print-receiving
lamination and the adhesive layer. Since a liquid toner or ink containing
mineral oil must be absorbed by the print-receiving medium, the print-receiving
medium must be porous. Normally, that porosity results in the mineral oil
reaching the adhesive and degrading its condition as an adhesive. A barrier
layer prevents that, but is an additional expense in material cost and in
manufacturing, as well as adding some bulk to the label.This invention employs a known paper substitute, Teslin, a trademark product
of PPG Industries, Inc., for label preparation in a lamination not having or
requiring a barrier layer. U.S. Patent No. 4,861,644 to Young et al describes
what appears to be Teslin material and teaches printing on it as a paper
substitute. Liquid inks and xerographic printing are both mentioned. U.S.
Patent No. 5,140,934 to Pennelle teaches a bookmark, including an
embodiment in which Teslin sheets, each having an adhesive layer, are
stacked. No specific mention is made of printing on the sheets.
US-A-3 794 439 discloses composite labels comprising a
print-receiving layer, an adhesive layer and a release layer. Labels are printed from a liquid ink having mineral oil by printing on a sheet
having a Teslin print-receiving lamination, an organic adhesive lamination
contacting the Teslin lamination, and a support lamination contacting the
adhesive.The Teslin lamination immobilizes the printing to give excellent permanent
printed images. The adhesive is not degraded by the mineral oil, which means
the mineral oil is held from the adhesive, so the expenses and added bulk of a
barrier layer are avoided.The present invention as claimed in claim 1 is a method of preparing labels.
The synthetic label system accepts liquid
electrophotography toners without requiring a barrier layer between the print-receiving
material and the adhesive layer, and that requires no pre-treatment of
the print-receiving material to enhance oil absorption. This label employs a
synthetic material, such as Teslin, a trademark for microporous, plastic printing
sheet. Teslin is described by its manufacturer as a polyolefin based,

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing labels having an organic adhesive backing degradable
by mineral oil for affixing said labels to surfaces, comprising printing on a print-receiving

lamination with imaging ink or toner containing mineral oil as a vehicle, said
print-receiving lamination being in contact with a lamination of said adhesive, and

said adhesive being in contact with a supporting lamination, said print-receiving
lamination being of a porous material which holds said mineral oil in said porous

material away from said adhesive.
The method as in claim 1 in which said material of said print-receiving
lamination is a porous polyolefin base having a major amount of siliceous filler.
The method as in claim 2 in which said material of said print-receiving
lamination is Teslin brand synthetic paper.
The method as in claim 3 in which said material of said print-receiving
lamination is about 0,2 mm (0,008 inch) thick.
