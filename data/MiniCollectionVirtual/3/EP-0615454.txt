<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a biological adhesive involves preparing and collecting a cryoprecipitate, constituting said adhesive, from a frozen plasma and is characterized in that the initial plasma used is a platelet-enriched plasma. This method is simpler than existing methods. Furthermore, the biological adhesive obtained containes endogenous prothrombine and can therefore be coagulated without the addition of thrombine, this being particularly advantageous in the case of an autologous biological adhesive. Application particularly in treating wounds or in placing and holding grafts or portions of prostheses.

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a biological adhesive, in which a cryoprecipitate,
constituting said adhesive, is prepared and recovered from a frozen plasma,

wherein a platelet-enriched plasma is used as the starting plasma.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said enriched-plasma contains
at least 50 million platelets per ml.
The method according to the preceding claim, wherein said starting
plasma contains from 100 million to 1 billion platelets per ml, and in particular

from 100 million to 500 million platelets per ml.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
cryoprecipitate is heated in order to obtain said adhesive in liquid form.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a platelet-enriched
plasma is prepared in first place from collected blood.
The method according to the preceding claim, wherein said plasma is
obtained from one donor, and all steps of said method are carried out in a

system of bags used for collecting blood.
Use other than in a method for treatment of the human or animal body by
surgery or therapy ; of a biological adhesive obtained according to the method of

any one of the preceding claims, wherein an agent which promotes activation of
endogenous prothrombin is added to said adhesive.
Use according to claim 7, wherein said agent is an aqueous solution
containing calcium ions.
Use according to claim 7, wherein said agent is thromboplastin, in the
presence of calcium ions.
Use according to claim 7, wherein said agent is an activator of
coagulation factor XII, in the presence of calcium ions. 
Use according to the preceding claim, wherein said activator is selected
from solid compounds which are insoluble in the biological adhesive and have

negative charges.
Use according to the preceding claim, wherein said solid compound is
selected from silicates, silica glass, calcium carbonate and tricalcium dicitrate.
