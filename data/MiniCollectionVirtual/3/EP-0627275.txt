<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for casting metal strip in 
which molten metal is introduced between a pair of parallel 

casting rollers (16) via a tundish (18) and metal delivery 
nozzle (19b). Casting rollers (16) are cooled so that 

shells solidify on the moving roller surfaces and are 
brought together at the nip between them to produce a 

solidified strip product (20) at the roller outlet. A 
casting pool is established by pouring a first batch of 

molten metal at a relatively high temperature above the 
liquidus temperature of molten metal through the delivery 

nozzle (19b) and is thereafter maintained by pouring 
through the delivery nozzle (19b) a second batch of m
olten 
metal at a relatively lower temperature. The bottom of the 

tundish (18) is formed with a well (26) to hold the first 
batch of molten metal and there is heating means (48) to 

heat the metal in the well (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the casting of metal
strip. It has particular but not exclusive application to
casting of ferrous metal strip.It is known to cast metal strip by continuous
casting in a twin roll caster. Molten metal is introduced
between a pair of contra-rotated horizontal casting rolls
which are cooled so that metal shells solidify on the
moving roll surfaces and are brought together at the nip
between them to produce a solidified strip product
delivered downwardly from the nip between the rolls. The
term "nip" is used herein to refer to the general region at
which the rolls are closest together. The molten metal may
be poured from a ladle into a smaller vessel from which it
flows through a metal delivery nozzle located above the nip
so as to direct it into the nip between the rolls, so
forming a casting pool of molten metal supported on the
casting surfaces of the rolls immediately above the nip.
This casting pool may be confined between side plates or
dams held in sliding engagement with the ends of the rolls.Twin roll casting has been applied with some
success to non-ferrous metals which solidify rapidly on
cooling, for example aluminium. However, there have been
problems in applying the technique to the casting of
ferrous metals. As a consequence of the much slower rate
of solidification of ferrous metals, it is absolutely
critical to achieve an even cooling and solidification at
the casting surfaces to allow continuous casting to proceed
satisfactorily. This can be very difficult to achieve,
particularly at the commencement of a casting run.
Generally it requires that the molten metal be caused to
flow through small flow passages formed in refractory
material in a metal delivery nozzle. Although the metal
delivery nozzle is preheated prior to a casting run, the
refractory material around the small flow passages is very
prone to localised cooling which can lead to premature 
solidification of the molten metal, particularly during
start-up. It has therefore been necessary to supply the
molten metal to the delivery nozzle at temperatures well in
excess of the liquidus temperature of the molten metal in
order to ensure that none of the metal solidifies
prematurely due to localised cooling effects as it passes
through the delivery nozzle. Typically, the metal may need
at start-up to be preheated so as to have more than 100°C
superheat, i.e. to a temperature more than 100°C above the
liquidus temperature of the metal. Prior to the present
invention, in the case of low carbon steels which have

A method of casting metal strip of the kind in
which molten metal is introduced into the nip between a

pair of casting rolls (16) via a metal delivery nozzle
(19b) disposed above the nip to create a casting pool of

molten metal supported on casting surfaces of the rolls
immediately above the nip and the casting rolls are rotated

to deliver a solidified strip (20) downwardly from the nip,
characterised in that casting is initiated by introducing,

through delivery nozzle (19b), a first batch of molten
metal having a first temperature into the nip between the

casting rolls (16) to form the casting pool at an initial
casting pool temperature, casting a strip of metal by

passing a first portion of the first batch of molten metal
between the casting rolls (16), adding to the casting pool,

through the delivery nozzle (19b), a second batch of molten
metal having a second temperature, wherein the second batch

of molten metal and the first batch of molten metal are
substantially the same molten metal, and wherein the second

temperature is less than the first temperature, and
continuing the casting step using a remaining portion of

the first batch of molten metal and the second batch of
molten metal to produce a continuous cast strip, wherein

the first temperature is at least 50°C greater than the
second temperature and the second temperature is such as to

reduce the casting pool temperature to less than 50°C above
the liquidus temperature of the molten metal.
