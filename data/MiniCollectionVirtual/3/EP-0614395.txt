<ABSTRACT>
A constructional toy component (13) which has on at least one edge (11), two portions (15, 16) each of which has associated therewith one of two complementary members (19, 18), the arrangement being such that when two similar edges are brought into abutment but in the opposite sense, the complementary members (19, 18) can interengage if one of the components is initially flexed to effectively vary the spacing between the complementary members thereon. In one form of the invention, the edges are formed of rod like members and thus the component is basically defined by a peripheral frame. After engagement is completed, and the flexure is released, there is effectively no deformation of either component, but the components are held together by the interrelationship of the complementary members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an educational toy and, in particular
to constructional toys which can be interconnected.There have been many different forms of educational toys which
are known generally as constructional toys in which the various
components connect together.Some of these, and the ones to which this invention relate are
basically in the form of flat members which may have various
shapes, such as triangles, squares, pentagons etc. and which are
connected together by complimentary portions along adjacent
edges.One well known toy of this type is sold under the registered
trade mark "Polydron". The Polydron toy has along its length one
portion which extends outwardly to a notional periphery of the
side and a portion which is located inwardly of this, the
outwardly directed portion having a cut away portion adjacent its
outer edge and the inward portion having an outwardly extending
portion on its outer edge, the inward edge portion being
effectively in line with the inward portion of the edge and the
outward end portion being effectively in line with the outward
portion.In the Polydron toy at the junction of the two portions there is 
a spring member which is formed of the same material as the body
of the toy and defined by two cut outs directed towards the
centre of the toy.The portions are formed with a pip on the outer edge of the
outwardly directed portion and a dimple on the outwardly directed
end portion adjacent the inward portion so that when two like
members are engaged but are inverted one relative to the other,
the pips and dimples engage and there is a resilient outward
pressure provided by the spring members which are in contact with
each other.It will be seen that the two members so inter-engaged are
effectively pivotally connected to each other and by proper
relationship with other members, structural members can be
produced.The Polydron toy, whilst satisfactory has a number of
disadvantages.First of these is that the spring members are put under stress
when adjacent members are interconnected and they can well break
and, once, one of these members is broken, there is no pressure
put on the junction between the pips and dimples and the
components do not hold together.The second is that where the members are solid it can be 
difficult to construct a complex shape as the building
of the shape has to all be done from effectively the
outer surface. A further disadvantage is that the
members are relatively expensive in that they are
formed from solid plastics material and the quantity
of

<CLAIMS>
A constructional toy component being in the form
of an open frame having at least three sides

(10,11,12), each side being formed of rod-like members
(15,16) at least two of which have parallel spaced

axes and are interconnected (17) at their contiguous
ends, the members being capable of co-operating with a

similar pair of members on another component, an
extension (18) located substantially axially on the

non-contiguous end of the member further from the
interior of the component, a recess (19) complementary

to the extension located adjacent the non-contiguous
end of the other member and being substantially co-axial

with the axis of the member further from the
interior of the component, each side being resiliently

deformable about an axis between the two ends of the
side so that when two sides of different components

are brought together, at least one of the sides can be
flexed about its axis to enable inter-engagement,

whereby the extension of one member enters the
complementary recess of the other, and vice versa, the

arrangement being such that, when the flexure is
released there is no deformation of the sides and the

components are held together by the inter-relationship
of the complementary members.
A toy component a claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the extension (18) is a

generally hemispherical extension and wherein the
recess (19) is a complementary generally hemispherical

recess.
A toy component as claimed in either claim 1 or 
claim 2, characterised in that the toy component is an

injected plastics moulding.
A toy component as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that the plastics material used is a

generally non-resilient plastics material.
An educational toy comprising at least two
components as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4

interconnected together to form a construction.
