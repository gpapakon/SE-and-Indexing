<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a exterior rear view mirror assembly for a 
motor vehicle which is of modular design, allowing a variety of vehicle 

styles and fold-back mechanisms to be catered for. The assembly, made up 
of components chosen from sets, comprises: a base (10), for attachment 

to the vehicle side; a housing (20), which contains the mirror (30) and 
the mirror tilting arrangement (40); and a housin
g positioning unit 
(50,50A). The positioning unit allows the housing (20) to be folded to a 

parking position generally parallel to the vehicle side, either towards 
the front or towards the rear of the vehicle, or from such a position to a 

viewing position, where the housing protrudes from the vehicle side. The 
positioning unit (50,50A) comprises a stationary part (51,51A) fixed to 

the base (10), a rotary part (52,52A) for attachment to the housing 
(20), the two parts being coupled by a rotating mechanism which includes 

a means of blocking the rotation when the housing is in a parking 
position. The positioning unit mounting portion (55,55A) and the 

complementary seating formed in the housing (23) are of a fixed shape, 
so that different positioning units can be used, for example manual 

units (50A) or motor-driven units (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
positioning device of a rearview mirror according to the preamble portion of claims 1,
2 and a series of rearview mirrors for vehicles according to the preamble portion of
claims 5, 7.
The rearview mirrors can be installed with their housing
on either side of a car body, for example, and can be turned by
hand or as driven by a motor to a viewing position (normal position) where it
protrudes laterally from the car body and gives the car driver a rearview and to
a viewing position (folded position) where the mirror housing is nearly parallel
to the car body.Various rearview mirrors of this type have been proposed so far,
including a typical one disclosed in
JP-A-61-94845. In this conventional
door mirror, the mirror housing having a mirror assembled therein is adapted
to take three positions: Viewing, first and second parking positions. Namely,
when in the viewing position, the mirror housing protrudes laterally from the
car body and gives the car driver a rearview. When in the first parking
position, the mirror housing outer end is directed toward the tail of the car body
while the housing mirror side faces the lateral side of car body. When in the
second parking position, the mirror housing outer end is directed toward the
head of the car body while the housing rear side faces the lateral side of car
body. The mirror housing can be turned from the second parking or viewing
position to the first parking position or from the first parking position to the
viewing or second parking position, depending upon the direction in which it is
pressed by hand, body of a person or any other thing. The mirror housing can
also be turned as pressed by hand. This rearview mirror has a positioning device
to turn the mirror housing in the above-mentioned directions. The positioning 
device has a stationary member that is to be fixed to a base, and a rotary member
that is to be fixed to the mirror housing. A shaft is provided in the stationary
member and the rotary member is rotatably mounted on the shaft. The rotary
member is forced by a coil spring fitted on the shaft to the stationary member.
When the mirror housing is pressed by hand, the rotary member can be rotated
along with the mirror housing to the viewing or first parking position against
the pressure of the coil spring.Also, another rearview mirror of the above-mentioned type in which the
mirror housing is turned as driven by a motor is disclosed in
-4 JP-U-114839.
In this example, the positioning device comprises a shaft on a
