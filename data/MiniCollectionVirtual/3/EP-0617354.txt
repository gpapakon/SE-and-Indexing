<ABSTRACT>
A portable computer system which includes a 
portable computer preferably a notebook computer, and an 

integral projector. The system includes a base portion 
containing a central processing unit and a user input 

device, such as a keyboard. The system also includes a lid 
portion which is removably hinged to the base portion and 

includes a display and a projector adjacent the display. 
When removed from the base portion the projector may receive 

information from the central processing unit through a cable 
or through a wireless communication circuit. The system may 

additionally include a sound system and a storage medium 
containing information to be projected, as well as a camera 

for capturing projected images and altering further images 
in real time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable
computer system and more specifically to a portable computer
system comprising a projection device for presenting
information on a screen.Computer displays are suited for use by an
individual or at most small viewing audiences. The typical
display used by most people is the 14-inch display. Such
displays are not well suited for large viewing audiences.
Projectors which operate in conjunction with computers are
available, although such projectors are not portable. Such
projectors have a limited bandwidth, which makes them
unsuitable for producing large images for large viewing
audiences.Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a
computer-based projection system which is both portable and
suitable for large audiences.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a portable computer system which is capable of
presenting information to large audiences.In accordance with the present invention there is
provided a portable computer system including a base portion
incorporating a central processing unit and a user
interface, and a lid portion incorporating a display coupled
to the central processing unit characterized in that the lid
portion further incorporates a projector coupled to the
central processing unit and capable of producing large images for the benefit of large audiences.The system may additionally include a sound system
and a storage medium containing information to be projected,
as well as a camera for capturing projected images and
altering further images in real time.An embodiment of the present invention will now be
explained by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a projection system
in accordance with the present invention;Figure 2 is a perspective view of the projection
system of Figure 1 illustrating a display mode of operation;Figure 3 is a side view of the projection system
of Figure 1 illustrating disassembly of the projector and
display;Figure 4 is a perspective view of the projection
system of Figure 1 illustrating assembly of the projector-display
unit;Figure 5 is a perspective view of the projection
system of Figure 1 in a projector mode of operation; andFigure 6 is a diagrammatic view of the projector
of Figure 3.Referring now to Figure 1, system 10 of the
present invention includes central processing unit (CPU) 12,
user interface device 14, display adapter 16, display 18,
sound device 20, storage device 21, projector 22, and camera
25.CPU 12, user input device 14,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A portable computer system (10) including a
base portion (40) incorporating a central processing unit

(12) and a user interface (14), and a lid portion (42)
incorporating a display (18) coupled to the central

processing unit (12) characterized in that the lid portion
(42) further incorporates a projector (22) coupled to the
