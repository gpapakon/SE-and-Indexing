<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing multilayered carbonless sheets on which indicia can be xerographically produced with little or no non-specific development. The process involves coating a sheet with a CB composition containing a carboxymethyl cellulose polymer, a crosslinker, a salt of a polyvalent metal ion and a small amount of a wall forming acrylic resin. The CB coating formed resists breakage and release of dye when non-specific pressure is applied to the sheet thereby resulting in CF copies having improved brightness and reduced non-specific development.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing
carbonless forms, in particular interleaved carbonless
forms comprising pressure-sensitive coated-back (CB)
sheets and coated front (CF) receiver sheets which can
be printed xerographically and which resist smudging
caused by non-specific development of the coated front
receiver sheets.Carbonless copy paper comprises two or more
juxtaposed sheets. The back surfaces of the sheets have
a coating containing a color-forming material often
referred to as a "coated back" or "CB" coating. The
coating consists of a continuous matrix or microcapsules
containing a pale or colorless color-forming material
and the CB coating is designed to rupture and release
the color-former when a threshold pressure is applied to
the front or opposite side of the sheet. Such a
microencapsulated dye CB system is described in EP-A-134818
by Mitsubishi Paper Mills. The front surfaces of
the receiver sheets, which in use are placed in contact
with the coated back surfaces of the overlaid sheets,
are coated with a composition containing a developer
component reactive with the color-forming material in
the CB sheets to change it to colored condition. These
sheets are referred to as "coated front" or "CF" sheets.
The multi-layered set of carbonless forms will consist
of a top sheet having only a CB coating, a bottom sheet
having only a CF coating and one or more intervening
sheets having both CB and CF coatings. Typically, the
forms also include printed indicia on the top surface of
at least the top sheet and one or more of the underlying
sheets, and blank spaces where information is filled in
by writing or typing. Upon the application of pressure
to the top sheet, the CB coatings are ruptured thereby
releasing the color-forming material imagewise to
contact, react with and form a visible color in the 
developer coating on the CF sheets. A visible color
image is produced in areas corresponding to the
locations where pressure has been applied to release the
color-forming material. Pressure applied to the top
sheet causes a corresponding mark on the front of each
sheet in the manifold set. Thus, multiple "carbon"
copies can be made at once.These carbonless forms are widely used in business,
particularly in retailing. One drawback to these sheets
is that the application of non-specific pressure, such
as a heavy object being placed on the sheets, can
rupture the CB coating, causing smudging or non-specific
development of the underlying CF sheets. Non-specific
development can occur when CB

A method for producing carbonless forms having
a dye-containing CB layer, said method comprising

coating the back surfaces of cellulosic sheets with a
formulation which comprises an emulsion of an oil

containing an acid-developable colour forming reactant

having a degree of substitution of at least 0.65, said
formulation also comprising a wall-forming acrylic

resin, a salt of a polyvalent metal and an organic
cross-linker whereby to form said CB layer,

characterised in that said formulation has a solids

(ii) providing a master sheet having indicia imprinted

thereon, and (iii) activating the copy cycle of said
machine to transfer a facsimile of said indicia onto the

front surfaces of said cellulosic sheets thereby to
produce sheets having on the front surfaces thereof

printed indicia and blank spaces for the insertion of
alphanumeric data by writing or impact typing and on the

back surfaces thereof an intact dye-containing CB layer.
