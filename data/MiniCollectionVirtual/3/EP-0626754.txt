<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention consists in breaking down a radio frequency signal to be modulated into at least a first and a second signal (@1(t) and @2(t)), representing respectively the sum of the output voltages of identical amplitude of a first and of a second defined number of modules, with which are associated respectively a first and a second vector (@1 and @2) the respective amplitude (E1, E2) and the phase ( phi 1,  phi 2) satisfy the condition that the vectorial sum (@S) of the two vectors (@1 and @2) coincides with a defined reference (@ref) serving as a phase reference for the two vectors (@1 and @2), in matching the phase ( phi ) of the load impedance of each module so that the vector (@) associated with the current delivered by each of the amplifier modules is phase delayed with respect to their output voltages, in modulating the phase ( phi 1,  phi 2) of the two signals (V1(t) and V2(t)) by the modulation signal and in adding the first and the second signal (V1(t) and V2(t)) which are phase modulated in order to obtain a resultant amplitude modulated signal (Vs(t)).
