<CLAIMS>
A munition (1, 101), of the smoke-generating type, 
comprising at least two smoke pots (7a, 7b) arranged in 

and ejected from a casing (2, 102) by means of an ejection 
composition (15, 115), each pot having an axial channel 

(14a, 14b), the axial ducts being aligned so as to form a 
priming channel for the smoke pots, priming being ensured 

by the ejection composition, which munition 
is 
characterized in that
 it comprises means (18) to ensure a 
temporary axial link between the two smoke pots (7a, 7b) 

when they are ejected and on their trajectory. 
A munition according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the linking means are formed by a substantially 

cylindrical ring (18) which penetrates into the axial 
channel (14a, 14b) of each of the smoke pots (7a, 7b) via 

holes arranged in the cartridges (12a, 12b) of each of the 
pots, this ring having an outer diameter (d) less than 

that of the axial channel and tightly fitting into the 
holes provided in the cartridges. 
A munition according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that ring (18) has a collar (20) pinched between the 

mutually contacting surfaces of the smoke pots (7a, 7b). 
A munition according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the ring (18) penetrates into each 

axial channel (14a, 14b) for a length (L) substantially 
equal to the outer diametre (d) of the ring. 
A munition according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the bore diameter of the ring (18) increases 

regularly from a median zone to each end. 
A munition according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the ring (18) is made of a natural 

or synthetic polymer material. 
A munition according to one of Claims 1 to 6 and in 
which the smoke pots (7a, 7b) generate a cloud of smoke 

opaque to infrared radiation, which munition (101) also 
has, forward of the casing (102) in the ejection 

direction, a housing (26) containing a dispersable powder  
 

charge that is intended to provide instant masking of 
infrared radiation, which munition is characterized in 

that it comprises a spring (18) arranged between the 
housing (26) containing the powder charge and the smoke 

pots (7a, 7b), which spring brakes the smoke pots by means 
of the housing when they are ejected outside the casing. 
A munition according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the spring (28) has a tapered shape. 
A munition according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the spring (28) is made integral with a smoke pot by 

means of a link (29).
