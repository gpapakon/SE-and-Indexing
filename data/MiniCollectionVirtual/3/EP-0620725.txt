Process for the production of homogeneous mixtures 
of liquid and/or solid perfume raw materials by mixing 

of the components and liquefaction of the mixture, 
characterised in that from 


a) solid 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene, 
b) solid or oily α,n-hexylcinnamaldehyde, 
c) oily p-t.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde, 
d) solid p-methoxyacetophenone and 
e) solid benzyl α-hydroxybenzoate 
 
there is formed a binary or ternary eutectic mixture 

liquid at room temperature which, in the case of binary 
mixtures, contains 10 - 90% and, in the case of ternary 

mixtures, 10 - 70% of the individual materials and into 
this mixture are introduced the remaining solid and 

liquid products simultaneously or in a sequence as 
desired for the mixture in question, independently of 

the chemical and physical nature of the materials. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the mixture is kept at a temperature between the 

melting point of the eutectic premixture and the melting 
temperature of the solid materials. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the melting or dissolving heat of 

the solid materials is introduced with an ultrasonic or 
microwave generator. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that several premixtures of different 

composition are mixed together to the desired formulation 
as scent components. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that scent components are modified by 

addition of further perfume materials.  
 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the addition of the liquid 

eutectic mixtures and of other perfume raw materials is 
carried out in an automatic computer-controlled mixing 

process without addition of solvents. 
Eutectic perfume premixture, characterised in that 
it consists of a binary or ternary eutectic mixture 

liquid at room temperature which is formed from 2 or 3 
of the following materials: 


a) solid 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene, 
b) solid or oily α,n-hexylcinnamaldehyde, 
c) oily p-t.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde, 
d) solid p-methoxyacetophenone and 
e) solid benzyl α-hydroxybenzoate, 
 
whereby, in the binary mixtures, are contained 10 - 90% 

and, in the ternary mixtures, 10 - 70% of the individual 
materials. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene 

and α,n-hexylcinnamaldehyde. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene 

and p-y.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene 

and p-methoxyacetophenone. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene 

and benzyl o-hydroxybenzoate.  
 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain α-n-hexylcinnamaldehyde 

and p-t.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain α,n-hexylcinnamaldehyde 

and p-methoxyacetophenone. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain α,n-hexylcinnamaldehyde 

and benzyl o-hydroxybenzoate. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterized in that they contain p-t.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde 

and p-methoxyacetophenone. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterized in that they contain p-t.-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamaldehyde 

and benzyl o-hydroxybenzoate. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterized in that they contain p-methoxyacetophenone 

and benzyl o-hydroxybenzoate. 
Eutectic perfume premixtures according to claim 7, 
characterised in that they contain 6-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyltetrahydronaphthalene,
