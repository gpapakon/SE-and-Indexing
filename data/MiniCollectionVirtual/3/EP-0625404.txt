<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a gear wheel, especially for a windscreen-wiper control device, of the type having, on one (2) of its front faces, a conducting track (5), consisting in providing, in the front surface, an impression (6) of a shape complementary to the shape of the conducting track (5), in fixing the conducting track (5) in the said impression (6) and in fastening the conducting track (5) to the front face (1) of the gear wheel. The front face (1) has a rim (10, 11, 13) extending the peripheral edge of the impression (6) and projecting as a rim (10, 11, 13) from the said impression (6). Application: control of a windscreen-wiper device.

A method of making a toothed wheel, especially for a
screen wiper control apparatus, of the type having a

conductive track (5) on one of its front faces (2),
consisting in providing in the front face a recess (6),

the form of which is complementary to the form of the
conductive track, fixing the conductive track (5) in the

said recess (6), and securing together the conductive
track (5) and the front face (2) of the toothed wheel,

the method further including forming on the front face an
edge element (10, 11) extending along the peripheral edge

of the recess (6) and projecting as a border (10, 11) of
the said recess (6) by stemming from the front face (2),

and wherein the said projecting edge element (10, 11) is
deformed, when the conductive strip (5) is disposed in

the recess (6), by exerting on the said projecting
peripheral edge element (10, 11) a substantially radial

stress directed towards the conductive track (5) until it
overlies the edge of the said conductive track (5),

characterised in that the front face (2) of the toothed
wheel is formed of a thermoplastic material, and in that

the peripheral edge element (10, 11) is deformed with the
aid of a hot matrix (20) exerting a pressure on the

peripheral edge element (10, 11).
A method of making a toothed wheel according to Claim
1, characterised in that the hot punch has a groove (14),

the width of which corresponds substantially to the width
of the peripheral edge element (10, 11), the side edges 

of the groove (14) being inclined towards the direction
of the conductive track (5).
A method according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the edge element (10, 11)

is situated in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the
conductive track (5).
A method according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the edge element (13) is

situated in the vicinity of the inner periphery of the
conductive track (5).
A method according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the conductive track (5)

stands proud of the surface of the wheel by an amount
between 0.20 millimetre and -0.05 millimetre.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the front face (1) has an axial

crown portion (3) constituting a projection, the
conductive track (5) having a cut-out of complementary

cross section in which the inner periphery (19) is
formed.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the axial crown portion comprises a projecting

positioning boss, the conductive track (5) having a
complementary cut-out.
