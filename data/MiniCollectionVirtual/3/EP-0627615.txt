<ABSTRACT>
A boiler water level system comprises a 
plurality of electrodes arranged to sense the 

resistivity of the fluid at each of a plurality of 
different levels in a pressure vessel. The pressure 

vessel is coupled to one end of the boiler such that 
the level of the water in the pressure vessel is 

substantially the same as the level in the boiler, and 
each electrode senses the resistivity of the fluid (ie 

water or steam) between the tip of the electrode and 
the wall of the pressure vessel. Such a system on its 

own inherently produces a digital output of relatively 
low resolution, so to improve resolution, and to 

provide an analogue output if desired, additional 
circuitry is provided to sense the progressive change 

in the impedance sensed by each electrode as the water 
rises to progressively immerse that electrode and then 

carries on rising towards the next electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid level sensing
systems, and is more particularly but not exclusively
concerned with boiler water level sensing systems of
the general kind disclosed in United Kingdom Patents
Nos 1 056 032 and 1 438 271.Boiler water level sensing systems of the kind
described in United Kingdom Patents Nos 1 056 032 and
1 438 271 typically comprise a vertically extending
cylindrical pressure vessel, sometimes called a "water
column", adapted to be connected near its top and near
its bottom to one end of a boiler, such that the water
level in the pressure vessel is substantially the same
as the water level in the boiler. A plurality of
vertically spaced electrodes sealingly project into the
pressure vessel, and are used to sense the electrical
impedance of the fluid in the pressure vessel at the
respective level of each electrode. Since the minimum
electrical impedance of steam is significantly greater
than the maximum electrical impedance of water, the
position of the water/steam interface can readily be
established. Systems of this kind are currently
commercialised by the Applicant under the trade mark
HYDRASTEP.Although this known kind of system is
extremely reliable and works well when used to provide
a visual display of water level, its output varies in a
relatively small number of discrete steps, typically 12
to 16. This is well suited to providing a
correspondingly stepped visual display, but is less
well suited tc control applications, for which an
output of considerably greater resolution, preferably a
continuous or analogue output, would be more suitable.
It is an object of the present invention to alleviate
this drawback. According to the present invention there is
provided a fluid level sensing system for sensing the
level of the interface between a first fluid and a
second fluid, the first fluid being beneath and of
lower electrical impedance than the second fluid, the
system comprising an electrically conductive vessel for
containing the fluids and a plurality of vertically
spaced sensors each of which has a sensing portion
which projects into and is electrically insulated from
the vessel and which is arranged, in use, to produce a
signal representative of the impedance of the fluid
between the sensing portion and the vessel, further
comprising output means responsive to said
impedance-representative signals for producing a first
signal which is dependent upon the ratio between the
impedance sensed by the sensor at or immediately below
said interface and a value for the
