Switched-capacitor network having a first
capacitor (Ca), which is alternately charged and discharged

by means of a first switching device (Sa1, Sa2)
and is connected to a first voltage source (Va) in order

to be charged, characterized by a second capacitor (Cb),
which is charged and discharged by means of a second

switching device (Sb1, Sb2) sychronously with the first
capacitor (Ca) and is connected between the first voltage

source (Va) and a second voltage source (Vb) in order to
be charged, the product of the capacitance of the first

capacitor (Ca) and the voltage of the first voltage
source (Va) being equal to the product of the capacitance

of the second capacitor (Cb) and the voltage difference
between the two voltage sources (Va, Vb), and the product

of the capacitance of the first capacitor (Ca) and the
contact resistance of the first switching device (Sa1) in

its lead path being equal to the product of the capacitance
of the second capacitor (Cb) and the sum of the

internal resistance (R
ib
) of the second voltage source
(Vb) and the contact resistance of the second switching

device (Sb1) in the lead path of the second capacitor
(Cb).
Switched-capacitor network, according to Claim 1,
characterized by two first capacitors (C12, C12'; C22,

C22') having the same capacitance, which are charged, by
means of the first switching device (S5, S5' to S8, S8'),

alternately and in antiphase with one another from the
first voltage source (V1, V2) with identical polarities

with respect to a reference-earth potential (M) and are
subsequently discharged via a respective input circuit of 

a differential amplifier (OP1, OP2), and by two second
capacitors (Ck12, Ck12'; Ck22, Ck22') having the same

capacitance, which are alternately charged and discharged
by means of the second switching device (Sr12, Sr12',

Sr22, Sr22', Sp12, Sp12', Sp22, Sp22') synchronously with
the first capacitors (C12, C12', C22, C22') and are

connected between the first voltage source (V1, V2) and
the second voltage source (2V1, 2V2) in order to be

charged.
Switched-capacitor network according to Claim 2,
characterized by two third capacitors (C11, C11', C21,

C21'), having the same capacitance, which are charged, by
means of a third switching device (S1, S1' to S4, S4')

from a signal voltage source (+E, -E) synchronously with
the first capacitors (C12, C12', C22, C22') with opposite

polarities to one another with respect to the reference-earth
potential (M) and are subsequently discharged via

a respective input circuit of the differential amplifier
(OP1, OP2), and by two fourth capacitors (Cr12, Cr12',

Cr22, Cr22') having the same capacitance as the first
capacitors (C12, C12', C22, C22'), which fourth

capacitors are charged, by means of the third switching
unit (S1, S1' to S4, S4'), in antiphase with the respectively

corresponding first capacitor (C12, C12', C22,
C22') from the signal voltage source (+E, -E) with

identical polarities with respect to the reference-earth
potential (M) and are subsequently discharged via a

respective input circuit of the differential amplifier
(OP1, OP2).
