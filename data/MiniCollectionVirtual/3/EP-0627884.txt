<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with spread products, in
particular with spread products of low fat content, and
processes for their preparation.Many attempts have been made to formulate low fat spread
products. Amongst the various reasons why such products are
desired is the wish to reduce the caloric content of the
spread and other dietetic considerations and the wish to
lower the production costs, in particular by reducing the
raw material costs.A substance that has widely been applied as a fat extender
is water. This use of water has, for example, led to the
introduction of so-called halvarines. If relatively high
levels of water are used, often thickening agents and/or
gelling agents are used for avoiding adverse effects of the
high water level.For example EP 298 561 (Unilever N.V.) describes the
preparation of edible plastic dispersions not having a
continuous fat phase, said composition including at least
two gelling agents forming two gel-forming compositions.A problem with the products of EP 298 561 is that they
often do not have a flavour which is highly appreciated by
the consumer. Furthermore products according to EP 298 561
sometimes do not have an optimal texture and/or appearance
and sometimes are somewhat grainy.GB 2,229,077 relates to margarines containing 5-30 wt% of
fat, 8-15 % maltodextrin, 0.5-3% modified starch, 1-2 %
whey protein concentrate, 0.4-0.6 % carrageenan and
0.4-0.6 % gelatin. EP 237 120 relates to fat-continuous spreads containing at least
10% fat phase, and in which the dispersed aqueous phase may be
based on gelatin and hydrolysed starch.EP 509 707 which was not published before the priority date of
this application and discloses spreads comprising 2-20%
hydrolysed maltodextrins and 0.05-1.5% alginate, 0.5-5% gelatin
and a calcium source. It is the object of the present invention to formulate low
fat spread products having a good flavour, texture,
appearance and which are not grainy. Surprisingly it has
been found that these high quality, low fat products can be
obtained if specific gelling agents are used at specified
levels in combination with a narrowly defined level of fat.Accordingly the present invention relates to a water-continuous
spread comprising:
(A) from 2 to 7 wt% of gelatin;(B) from 5 to 30 wt% of gelling hydrolysed starch;
and(C) from 1.2 to 4 wt% of fat.Although applicants do not wish to be bound by any theory
it is believed that the good quality of the product may be
caused by the fact that the gelatin and gelling hydrolysed
starch may form two
