<ABSTRACT>
Introduction of futile cycles in the glycolytic pathway of 
yeast strains enables enhanced gas production and ethanol 

production under stress conditions, e.g. in a sugar-rich 
dough having a sugar content of higher than 3% weight 

percentage based on flour, e.g. 20%, or at high ethanol 
concentration in an industrial ethanol production process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement of gas
and alcohol production by yeast.Yeast strains, e.g. those belonging to the genus
Saccharomyces, are used worldwide in the production of
ethanol and leavening of bread. The yeast cell is equipped
with a highly efficient machinery for the rapid fermentative
conversion of fermentable sugars that are available in the
dough, e.g. maltose, glucose and sucrose, into equimolecular
amounts of CO2 and ethanol. For many years, one of the major
goals in yeast research has been the improvement of the CO2
production rate of baker's yeast, which is commercially
available as active dry 92-94%, instant dry 94-97%,
compressed 26-33%, or cream yeast 15-21% dry matter. To this
end, various classical hybridisation and molecular genetic
approaches have been applied.One such approach has been presented in published
international application WO 87/03006. This application
describes that the introduction into yeast cells of a
process that reduces the cellular level of ATP stimulates
glycolysis, presumably by stimulating those glycolytic steps
in which ATP is generated. For this purpose, the fdp* gene
was introduced into Saccharomycescerevisiae and
constitutively expressed. The mutant fdp* gene encodes a
modified form of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
(FBPase), in which Ala replaces Ser-12
thereby preventing allosteric negative control during growth
on glucose. In addition, to prevent transcriptional
repression during growth on glucose, the fdp* gene was
placed under control of the constitutive gpdh promoter. In
this way, a futile cycle was introduced in the glycolytic
pathway of Saccharomycescerevisiae at the level of the 
phosphofructokinase enzyme, resulting in the net hydrolysis
of ATP. At the end of the anaerobic growth cycle,
significantly higher CO2 production (25% higher) was
observed. However, no increase in CO2 production was observed
during the exponential growth phase of anaerobic growth. In
lean dough (0-2% sugar), no or only a slight increase in CO2
production rate was observed. Therefore, the use of the fdp*
gene alone for the improvement of gas production in lean
dough is of limited value since any improvement will likely
be confined to the end of the fermentation.Angeles Navas et al. (Angeles Navas, M., Cerdan, S.,
and Gancedo, J.M. (1993) Futile cycles in Saccharomycescerevisiae
strains expressing gluconeogenic enzymes during
growth on glucoase, Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA 90, 1290-1294)
