<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a controlled deflection roll or an extended 
nip press, such as is used in the papermaking industry to process a 
traveling paper web. More particularly, this invention relates to the piston 
which is supported in a channel on a support shaft within a controlled 
deflection roll or extended nip press to bias a shoe outwardly relative to 
the shaft to engage and control the deflection of the roll shell rotating 
about the shaft. Still more particularly, this invention relates to a unique 
seal arrangement between the piston and the side walls of the channel and 
end dams at the ends of the channel. In prior controlled deflection rolls as being known from US-A-3 624 880, the piston, which actuates a shoe 
which contacts the inner surface of the rotating roll shell to control the 
deflection of the roll shell and to load the roll shell into nipping 
engagement with a mating roll, has a pair of continuous slots extending 
around the piston in which corresponding seals are disposed to engage the 
side walls of a channel in which the piston is disposed. At the ends of the 
piston, the seals contact a flat surface of an end plate which is vertically 
arrayed in an end dam mounted to the support shaft. The end plate is, in 
turn, biased toward the seal by hydrau!ic pressure which is introduced 
between the end plate and end dam. The end plate is movable relative to  
 
the end dam toward the piston and its seal. When the piston is 
hydraulically actuated to move radially outwardly relative to the support 
shaft, the same hydraulic fluid is also introduced into a space between the 
end plate and the end dam which restrains the end plate from movement 
in any direction except toward and away from the piston in a direction 
parallel with the longitudinally extending length of the piston in the 
channel in the support shaft. The seals in the side slots in the piston are biased outwardly with 
springs. The end seals are fitted to the ends of the side seals so as to 
maintain sealing continuity around the ends of the piston. The fluid seal at 
the ends of the piston is effected, as explained above, by maintaining the 
end plates disposed in the end dams biased against the end seals by the 
same pressurized hydraulic fluid which is used to actuate the roll shell-supporting 
shoe, which is either supported by the piston or is an 
integral part of the piston. The piston is, thus, sealed about its entire 
periphery such that the hydraulic fluid which pressurizes and actuates the 
piston cannot
