<ABSTRACT>
The cable coupling clamp is to be used in cableways for transporting workpieces in a production plant with suspension gear (2) which can be coupled to a circulating conveying cable (4), receives the workpieces and is supported by rails (1). The cable clamp (5) has two clamping jaws (11, 12) which grasp the conveying cable (4), one clamping jaw (11) being secured to a clamping frame (6) and the other clamping jaw (12) being capable of being pressed onto the conveying cable (4) by means of spring force and lifted off from it by means of a lever (16) which is pivotably mounted on the clamping frame (6) and can be controlled by a fixed connecting member. The clamp frame (6) is coupled to the suspension gear (2) by means of a pivotably mounted link (7). When the cable clamp (5) is secured to the conveying cable (4), the link (7) or the straight element (10) which connects its two pivot axes (8, 9) is approximately vertical. The pivot axes (8, 9) of the link (7) lie parallel to the axis of the clamping mouth, formed by the two clamping jaws (11, 12), of the cable clamp (5). When the clamping mouth is open and the clamp (5) has been pivoted down laterally from the carrying cable (4) by means of the link (7), the clamping mouth lies at the side of and below the conveying cable (4).

<CLAIMS>
A connectible cable clamp for cable conveyors for
transporting production parts in a manufacturing plant,

comprising suspension gear (2) which may be connected to a
circulating conveyor cable (4), holds the production parts and

is supported by rails (1), and the cable clamp (5) has at
least two clamping jaws (11,12) gripping the conveyor cable

(4), wherein one clamping jaw (11) is fixed to a clamp frame
(6) and the other clamping jaw (12) may be pressed against the

conveyor cable (4) by means of spring force and lifted off the
said conveyor cable by means of a lever (16) which is

pivotally mounted on the clamp frame (6) and is controllable
by a fixed slotted link, characterised in that the clamp frame

(6) is linked to the suspension gear (2) by means of at least
one pivotally mounted link (7) and, when the cable clamp (5)

is fixed to the conveyor cable (4), the link (7) or the
straight line (10) joining its two axes of rotation (8,9), is

approximately vertical, wherein the axes of rotation (8,9) of
the link (7) lie parallel to the axis of the clamp mouth of

the cable clamp (5) formed by the two clamping jaws (11,12),
and when the clamp mouth is open and the clamp (5) is pivoted

laterally off the supporting cable (4) by means of the link
(7), the clamp mouth is located at the side of and underneath

the conveyor cable (4).
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 1,
characterised in that the standard distance of the axis of the

clamp mouth from the axis of rotation (9) of the link (7)
located on the clamp frame (6) is approximately the same as,

possibly slightly greater than, the distance between the two
axes of rotation (8,9) of the link (7).
A connectible cable clamp according to one of claims 1 or
2, characterised in that the axis of rotation (9) of the link

(7) on the clamp frame (6) and the axis of rotation of the 
lever (16) controllable by a slotted link and used for

displacing the movable clamping jaw (12) coincide.
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 1,
characterised in that the clamp frame (6) having one clamping

jaw (11) is peripherally closed and, on the side directed away
from the clamping jaw (11), freely rotatable guide rollers

(13,14) are mounted on transverse spars (18,19) fixed above or
beneath the clamp frame (6), the axes of the said guide

rollers being at right angles to the axis of the clamp mouth.
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 1,
characterised in that the movably mounted clamping jaw (12)

has a shaft (21) which is positioned laterally and passes
through a spring assembly (26), the side of the said shaft

directed away from the clamping jaw (12) bearing a pressure
roller (29) which may be brought into operative connection

with the pivotable lever (16) operating the clamp.
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 5,
characterised in that the pressure roller (29) has a shaft

(28) passing therethrough and this shaft is at least as long
as the width of the clamp frame (6) and the ends of the shaft

(28) project into oblong recesses (30) provided in the clamp
frame (6).
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 1 or 5,
characterised in that the pivotable lever (16) controlled by

the slotted link is U-shape and the clamp frame (6) is located
between the legs (33) of the in-shape lever (16), and a

spherical rolling body (15) is mounted, rotatable freely, on
the transverse spar (20) of the U-shape lever (6) [sic, recte

16] and on the side thereof directed away from the clamping

jaws (11,12), and, when the clamp is closed, the inside of the
transverse spar (20) adjoins the pressure roller (29) in a

detent action. 
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 5,
characterised in that the shaft (21) of the displaceably

mounted clamping jaw (12) is held by a sleeve which is divided
in the longitudinal direction and, on their sides directed

away from one another, the sleeve parts (22,23) bear
respective flanges (24,25) which the spring assembly (26)

adjoins, and the sleeve part (22) located next to the clamping
jaw (12) is fixed to the shaft (21) of this clamping jaw (12)

and the other sleeve part (23) is mounted so as to be
displaceable relative to the shaft (21) or to the other sleeve

part (22).
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 8,
characterised in that, on its side directed away from the

clamping jaw (12), the sleeve part (23) displaceably mounted
on the shaft (21) is constructed like a fork (27) and the

pressure roller (29) and the shaft (28) thereof guided in the
clamp frame (6) are held in this fork (27).
A connectible cable clamp according to claim 6,

relative to the frame sides (17) and hook-like protuberances
(32) are fixed to the legs (33) of the lever (16), these

protuberances adjoining the protruding ends of the shaft (28)
