<ABSTRACT>
In order to manufacture a small-size thin-film electret having a charge distributed in a very homogeneous way, even on its edges, use is made of apparatus comprising an earthed electrode (2) for supporting a dielectric (1) to be charged, means for generating ions (3) in the vicinity of the dielectric, a grid (4) extending parallel to the surface of the dielectric to be charged, at a slight distance from this face, and taken to an electrical potential different from that of earth, and a conducting frame (7) insulated from the electrode and electrically connected to the grid, the said frame surrounding the dielectric and forming a single unit with the electrode.

A device for manufacturing an electret in the form of 
a thin dielectric layer or sheet that is permanently 

charged electrically, the device comprising an electrode 
(2) for supporting the dielectric (1) that is to be 

charged in order to become an electret, means for 
generating electric charge and for entraining it towards 

the dielectric, and a frame disposed close to the 
periphery of the dielectric, which frame is constituted 

and installed in such a manner as to carry electric 
charge of the same sign as the charge being implanted in 

the dielectric, at least while the dielectric is being 
charged, the device being characterized in that said 

frame (7, 12) forms a single block with the electrode 
(2). 
A device for manufacturing an electret according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the frame (7) is 

electrically conductive and is insulated from the 
electrode (2) by a solid electrically-insulating layer 

(8, 10). 
A device for manufacturing an electret according to 
claim 2, characterized in that the frame (7) forms an 

integral portion of a conductive plate (9) itself 
supporting the electrode (2) with the insulating layer 

(10) being interposed therebetween. 
A device for manufacturing an electret according to 
claim 2, characterized in that the frame (7) is pierced 

by an opening in which it receives the electret (1) and 
is placed on the electrode (2) with the 

insulating layer (8) being interposed therebetween. 
A device for manufacturing an electret according to 
clam 1, characterized in that the frame (12) is 

constituted by a dielectric suitable for receiving  
 

permanent electric charge, as is the dielectric (1) 
surrounded by said frame. 
A device for manufacturing an electret according to any one of claims 
4 and 5, characterized in that the frame (7, 12) itself
 
forms a portion of a grid or perforated layer or sheet 

designed for simultaneous manufacture of a plurality of 
electrets (1), and defines one of the meshes thereof.
