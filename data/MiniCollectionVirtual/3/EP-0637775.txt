<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a card used to express 
something or to transfer information or for other 
purposes utilizing a photograph together with some 
words. The card according to the present invention can 
be used, for example but not limited to, for a business 
card, a post card, an invitation card, an information 
card, a New Year's card, a Christmas card, a post-marital 
announcement card and the like. In the aforementioned cards, an appropriate 
photograph is often shown together with some words. In 
the case of a post card, for example, a photograph will 
be shown on one face thereof together with some messages 
written thereon and the name and address of the 
addressee will appear on the other face of the card. 
Hitherto, the following methods have been used as ways 
of exhibiting a photograph together with letters on a 
card. A first method is resolving of color constituting 
the letters and photograph and then repeatedly printing 
on a mounting sheet each time using a different 
constituting color. A second method is adhering a photograph directly 
onto a mounting sheet printed with an appropriate 
message thereon. A third method follows the developing process of 
photographs. In this method, a sheet of photographic 
paper is exposed to light through a negative film for 
the photographic part and simultaneously through a 
positive lith film for the letters. In the first method, however, complicated work is 
required for resolving the constituting color and the 
printing process requires much time and labor because 
printing must be repeated using each different  
 
constituting color. Moreover, the quality of the 
finished product is not always good because of color 
diffusion caused by slipping from the correct place by 
repeated printing. In the second method, because of the difficulty of 
adhering a photograph onto a mounting sheet so that both 
corresponding edges may coincide precisely with each 
other, there is a defect that the adhering process 
requires time and labor. In the third method, because photographic paper 
which is already developed and printed is used as a 
card, color diffusion of the letters and photograph 
tends not to occur, unlike the case of the first method. 
However, the color for the letters is restricted to 
white only, and in the case of slender letters such as 
Ming style letters some diffusion may occur so that the 
letters become illegible. Furthermore, it is difficult 
to print or write a message or the name and address of 
the sender on the face including a
