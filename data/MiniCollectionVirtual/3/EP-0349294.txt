<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit device of a 
master slice system has I/O cells (3) forming an input-­

output circuit formed so as to be able to select an input 
function or an output function. The I/O cells (3) are 

arranged in a radial layout around an internal cell array 
region (A). Each region forming an I/O cell has smaller 

and larger circuit elements (3a, 3b), the smaller circuit 
elements (3a) of the I/O cell forming the input-output 

circuit being located adjacent the internal cell array 
region (A), and larger circuit elements (3b) of the I/O 

cells (3) being adjacent the periphery of the 
semiconductor pellet (1). Thus, the semiconductor pellet 

(1) is provided with more regions forming I/O cells than 
of a conventional semiconductor integrated circuit device 

on a semiconductor pellet of the same size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit and, more particularly, to a 
semiconductor integrated circuit fabricated by a master 
slice approach, such as a gate array. A master slice approach method is able to produce various 
semiconductor integrated circuits respectively having 
different logic functions and memory functions from a master 
wafer by modifying a wiring pattern formed on the master 
wafer. The master wafer comprises, for example, rows each 
of a plurality of basic cells each consisting of complementary 
MISFETs. A plurality of basic cells for an I/O buffer 
circuit, respectively corresponding to external terminals 
are arranged in the periphery of the semiconductor integrated 
circuit along the direction of arrangement of the external 
terminals. Recent advancement in the function of the gate array type 
semiconductor integrated circuit device brought about urgent demand for 
the further miniaturization and increase in the degree of integration of 
the circuit elements of the gate array.  
 A technique for the miniaturization of circuit 
elements and the augmentation of the degree of integration 
of the gate array is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open 
No. 63-53948. According to this known technique, a rectangular 
basic cell for an input-output buffer circuit (hereinafter 
referred to as "I/O cell") disposed outside an internal 
cell array region in which a plurality of rows of basic 
cells are arranged at predetermined intervals along the 
direction of lines with wiring regions therebetween is 
divided into a basic cell for an input buffer circuit 
(hereinafter referred to as "input circuit cell") and a 
basic cell for an output buffer circuit (hereinafter referred 
to as "output circuit cell"), such input circuit 
cells and such output circuit cells are arranged alternately 
along the direction of arrangement of such I/O cells, and 
external terminals (hereinafter referred to as "bonding 
pads") are arranged around the I/O cell region in 
correspondence with the I/O cells. This known technique divides an I/O cell forming 
region into input circuit cell forming regions and output 
circuit cell forming regions to decide the size of the input 
circuit cell forming regions without being restricted by the 
size of the output circuit cells. The size of the input 
circuit forming region is diminished by an area corresponding 
to a vacant space in which no circuit element is formed  
 
or an area saved by the miniaturization of the circuit 
elements.
