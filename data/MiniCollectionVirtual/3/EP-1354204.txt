<DESCRIPTION>
 HCV ANTIGEN/ANTIBODY COMBINATION ASSAYTechnical FieldThe present invention pertains generally to viral diagnostics. In particular, the mvention relates to an antigen/antibody combination assay for accurately diagnosing hepatitis C virus infection.Background Of The InventionHepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the principal cause of parenteral non- A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) which is transmitted largely through blood transfusion and sexual contact. The virus is present in 0.4 to 2.0% of blood donors. Chronic hepatitis develops in about 50% of infections and of these, approximately 20% of infected individuals develop liver cirrhosis which sometimes leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Accordingly, the study and control of the disease is of medical importance. HCV was first identified and characterized as a cause of NANBH by Houghten et al. The viral genomic sequence of HCV is known, as are methods for obtaining the sequence. See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 89/04669; WO 90/11089; and WO 90/14436. HCV has a 9.5 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and is a member of the Flaviridae family of viruses. At least six distinct, but related genotypes of HCV, based on phylogenetic analyses, have been identified (Simmonds et al., J. Gen. Virol. (1993) 74:2391-2399). The virus encodes a single polyprotein having more than 3000 amino acid residues (Choo et al., Science (1989) 244:359-362; Choo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991) 88:2451-2455; Han et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991) 88: 1711-1715). The polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally into both structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. 

 In particular, as shown in Figure 1, several proteins are encoded by the HCN genome. The order and nomenclature of the cleavage products of the HCV polyprotein is as follows: ΝH2-C-El-E2-p7-ΝS2-ΝS3-ΝS4a-ΝS4b-ΝS5a-ΝS5b-COOH. Initial cleavage of the polyprotein is catalyzed by host proteases which liberate three structural proteins, the N-terminal nucleocapsid protein (termed "core") and two envelope glycoproteins, "El" (also known as E) and "E2" (also known as E2/NS1), as well as nonstructural (NS) proteins that contain the viral enzymes. The NS regions are termed NS2, NS3, NS4 and NS5. NS2 is an integral membrane protein with proteolytic activity. NS2, either alone or in combination with NS3, cleaves the NS2-NS3 sissle bond which in turn generates the NS3 N-terminus and releases a large polyprotein that includes both serine protease and RNA helicase activities. The NS3 protease serves to
