Packing device for articles such as, for example, 
furniture parts, electrical appliances, ceramic tiles and 

the like, having a base element (6) with four jaws (1, 2, 
3, 4) which are disposed at the corners and of which 

opposite pairs of jaws (1, 2; 3, 4) can be adjusted in 
relation to one another along a first axis and the jaws 

of each pair of jaws can be adjusted along a second axis 
perpendicular thereto, wherein the jaws can be fixed in 

the desired settings in accordance with the dimensions of 
the article to be packed and wherein the jaws have guide 

elements (5) which are in engagement in such a way with 
the base element (6), which can be drawn out in the 

direction of the first axis, that the jaws can be 
adjusted in the direction of the second axis, 


characterized in that
 the base element is formed by a 
two-part baseplate (6) which consists of a receiving part 

(6a) with a recess in which guide grooves (9) are 
disposed, and of an insertion plate (6b) with lateral 

guide rails (10), which insertion plate can be inserted 
in the receiving part (6a). 
Packing device for articles such as, for example, 
electrical appliances, ceramic tiles, furniture parts and 

the like, having a base element (6) with four jaws (1, 2,

elements (5) which are in engagement in such a way with 
the base element (6), which can be drawn out in the 

direction of the first axis, that the jaws can be 
adjusted in the direction of the second axis, 


characterized in that
 the base element (6) is formed by a 
two-part frame consisting of an outer and an inner frame  

 
part, which parts are in engagement with one another via 

guide rails and can be displaced in relation to one 
another in the direction of drawing out. 
Packing device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the jaws and/or the base element are constructed 
in an impact-absorbing manner and are preferably 

provided with a profiling in the form of a pattern of 
knobs, inner honeycomb structure or the like. 
Packing device according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the adjusting arrangements of the jaws and the 
base frame parts are provided with latching and/or 

locking arrangements for securing the adjustment 
positions of the device on the article to be packed and

characterized 
in that
 the jaws (1 to 4) are provided, on surfaces that 
touch the base element (6), with a profiling, preferably 

after the manner of a saw-tooth or pawl profile, which is 

in engagement with a corresponding profiling or latch on 
the base element (6) for fixing the position of the jaws, 

and the receiving part (6a) and the insertion plate (6b) 
are designed so as to be capable of latching into one 

another. 
Packing device according to one of Claims 1 or 3, 

characterized in that
 the said device can be connected
