<ABSTRACT>
The closing of the lid (13) of the hopper (16) causes the end (32) of the door (30) of the drum to come into contact against the catch (12) for actuating a locking hook (40), having an operating handle (5) free to rotate with respect to a spindle (10) located in front of the locking tip (41), until the said rotary handle (5) comes into contact with the ramp (14) of the lid (13) of the hopper (16). Setting the drum into rotation, in one direction or the other, causes the tip (41) of the locking hook (40) to be engaged in the cavity (31) in the door (30), by the handle (5) rolling along the ramp (14) of the lid, or by passing under the front base (161) of the hopper (16).
