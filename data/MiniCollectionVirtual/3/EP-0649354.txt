<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a die set
in combination with a rotary apparatus
for processing a
work piece, in two stages in a single die, and in
particular
for first of all blanking out an opening, and then forming
edge formations in the work piece around the opening.In various work piece processing operations, and in
particular in the processing of sheet metal, it is
frequently desirable to form openings in a work piece, and
then to form a variety of formations around the edge of the
opening.In the past, traditional engineering has generally
dictated that these two steps be carried out in two
separate dies sets. In certain cases progressive dies have
been used, in which a series of dies treat the same work
piece, and the work piece moves in an intermittent start
stop fashion through the progressive dies. In other
proposals, a work piece of a predetermined size is inserted
into a die. In a first operation the edge of the work
piece is trimmed, and then the die descends further and
forms the rest of the work piece.This process is relatively slow however and is
unsuitable for many applications.Still other proposals have been made in which a work
piece is punched out of the sheet, and the punched out
piece is then worked in the same die. Again this is a
relatively slow process.It is desirable as far as possible to speed up the
processing of a metal work piece, thereby reducing its
cost.This is particularly true in the case of a rotary
apparatus for processing a work piece on a continuously 
moving line. Such rotary apparatus is disclosed in U.S.
Letters Patent 5,040,397, inventor Ernest R. Bodnar (nearest state of
the art).In such an apparatus a plurality of die sets are
mounted on respective upper and lower die supports on
respective upper and lower rollers. The sheet metal work
piece passes between the two rollers and is processed by
the die sets.The operation of the dies on the work piece or sheet
metal must therefore be carried out at high speeds so that
the line can be run at an economical speed.A typical product manufactured on such a line is shown
in U.S. Letters Patent 4,793,113, inventor Ernest R.
Bodnar. It will be observed that the products illustrated
in the second patent comprise a series of openings formed
through a work piece, and flanges formed around the
openings. Longitudinal bend formations are formed in the
product, but these of course would be formed by
conventional roll forming dies.If old technology single stage dies were used on the
rotary apparatus, to make this product, then it was
