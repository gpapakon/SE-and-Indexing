<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer sheet for the formation of a 
color image is disclosed which has a high heat 

sensitivity and can provide a full-color image having 
good color density and light fastness even when the heat 

energy applied is low and, at the same time, can realize 
very excellent reproduction in a wide range of colors. 

The thermal transfer sheet for the formation of a color 
image comprises a substrate sheet and, formed on one 

surface of the substrate sheet in a successive manner, 
dye layers of at least three colors of yellow, magenta 

and cyan respectively comprising dyes of three colors of 
yellow, magenta and cyan and resin binders for respective 

dyes, wherein the yellow dye is a dye represented by the 
formulae (1) and/or (2), the magenta dye is at least one 

member selected from the group consisting of dyes 
represented by the formulae (3) to (5) and the 

cyan dye is a dye represented by the formulae (6) and/or 
(7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer 
sheet for the formation of a color image. More 
particularly, it is concerned with a thermal transfer 
sheet for the formation of a high-sensitivity full-color 
image, which thermal transfer sheet can reproduce a wide 
range of colors comparable to various types of 
conventional color printing on a commercial scale and can 
provide images having excellent light fastness. Color printing has hitherto been carried out in 
large volumes by offset printing, gravure printing or 
other printing methods. In such color printing, an 
original per se or a combination of an original with 
other originals, letters, symbols and the like, is 
subjected to color separation to prepare plates for three 
colors of cyan, magenta and yellow. A plate for black is 
further prepared according to need, and the hue and 
pattern of the original is reproduced using printing inks 
for respective colors. In most cases, pigments are used as colorants for 
inks of three primary colors of cyan, magenta and yellow 
in the above printing system. In this case, three 
primary color pigments known to be best suited for color 
printing from various experience in the past are selected 
so that a wide variety of colors ranging from the three 
primary colors to colors intermediate between them can be 
reproduced. The above-described conventional printing system 
has a problem that high equipment cost and large space 
are necessary because it is indispensable to always 
prepare plates respectively for the three primary colors 
or plates respectively for four colors (i.e., black in 
addition to the three primary colors). For example, 
color printing cannot be simply carried out in small 
workshops and offices.  
 In order to solve the above problem, a proposal has 
been made on a thermal transfer system where a thermal 
transfer sheet for three primary colors is prepared using 
sublimable (or thermomigratory) dyes and the dyes are 
transferred by means of thermal energy using the thermal 
transfer sheet system requiring neither a large printing 
machine nor other various equipment and enables color 
images to be simply formed, which renders the thermal 
transfer system promising. In the above-described thermal transfer system, a 
material, to which an image is to be transferred, and a 
thermal transfer sheet are put on top of the other, and 
thermal energy is applied by a thermal head or other 
means from either the material, to which an image is to 
be transferred, or the thermal transfer
