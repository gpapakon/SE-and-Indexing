A device for varying the pitch of the blades of a
turbomachine rotor, the blades being disposed on a disc

rotated by a shaft of the turbomachine, each blade
having a root pivotable around a longitudinal axis of

the blade, characterised in that it comprises actuating
means for changing blade pitch and means for locking

the blade root, the actuating means comprising an
electric motor having a wound stationary stator (5)

and a rotor (7) secured to the turbomachine shaft (2)
and having no electrical connection to the stator and

being rigidly secured to a toothed wheel (8) meshing
with pinion sectors (9) rigidly secured to the root (4)

of each blade (1), the locking means comprising an
electromechanical actuator (13) rigidly secured to the

turbomachine shaft (2) and electrically energised by
way of a rotating transformer (25).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the system embodied by a pinion (9), the toothed

wheel (8) and the rotor (7) of the electric motor has a
maximal angular movement defined by two fixed abutments

(10, 11) corresponding to two blade end positions.
A device according to claim 2, characterised in
that it comprises at least one movable abutment (20)

corresponding to at least one intermediate blade
position between the two end positions.
A device according to claim 3, characterised in
that the movable abutment (20) is an electromagnet (12)

energised by way of a rotating transformer. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in
that the electromagnet (12) comprises in a casing

rigidly secured to the shaft (2) a winding in which a
metal rod (22) is movable in translation.
A device according to claim 5, characterised in
that a return spring is disposed around the rod (22).
A device according to any of the previous claims,
characterised in that the electromechanical actuator

(13) is associated with a bolt (14) for retaining the
blade root in a predetermined position and comprises in

a casing rigidly secured to the shaft (2) a winding in
which a metal rod (15) movable in translation is

disposed, the rod (15) being rigidly secured to the
bolt (14).
A device according to claim 7, characterised in
that it also comprises means for monitoring the

position of the rod (22) of the electromagnet (12)
serving as the movable abutment (20) and/or means for

monitoring the position of the rod (15) of the bolt
actuator (13), the position-monitoring means comprising

for each of the rods (22, 15) a position detector (17)
associated with a position monitor (28) electrically

energised by way of at least one rotating transformer
when the rod (22, 15) is in its retracted position.
A device according to claim 8, characterised in
that the position detector (17) is a limit contact.
A device according to claim 9, characterised in
that the position monitor (28) is electrically 

energised by way of two rotating transformers (25, 29),
the first (25) of which comprises a fixed primary

winding (18) connected to an electric power supply (26)
and a secondary winding (19) secured to the shaft (2)

whereas the second (29) comprises: a primary winding
(30) secured to the shaft (2) and connected by way of

the position detector (17) to the casings of the
secondary winding (19) of the first rotating

transformer (25); and a secondary winding (31)
connected to the position monitor (28).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in
that the position monitor (28) is electrically

energised by way of a single rotating transformer (32)
comprising two independent sets of windings, the first

of which comprises a primary winding (33) connected to
an electric power supply (26) and a secondary winding

(34) connected to an oscillator (37) by way of the
position detector (17), the second set of windings

having only a few turns and comprising a primary
winding (35) connected to the oscillator (37) and a

secondary winding connected to the position monitor
(28).
A process for controlling the device for varying
the pitch of the blades of a turbomachine rotor

according to any of the previous claims, characterised
in that to change over from a locked position on a

first abutment to a locked position on a second
abutment it resides in: 


measuring the speed of rotation of the
turbomachine shaft (2) and monitoring the position of

the bolt (14);
energising the electric motor;
producing between the stator (5) and rotor (7) of
the electric motor a magnetic field rotating at a

different speed from the shaft (2) and producing a
magnetic torque able to lock the blades on the first

abutment for unlocking and to retain the blades in the
same position during the unlocking operation;
energising the bolt actuator (13) to release the
blade root (4);
altering the speed of rotation of the rotating
field so that the direction of the magnetic torque is

reversed and the blades rotate around their
longitudinal axis from the first abutment as far as the

second abutment;
interrupting the energisation of the locking
system to lock the blade root on the second abutment,

and
interrupting the energisation of the electric
motor.
A process according to claim 12, characterised in
that it also comprises, for changing over from a locked

position on the first abutment to a locked position on
the second abutment: 


monitoring the position of the movable abutment

energising the actuator (12) of the movable
abutment (20) before energising the bolt actuator (13),

and
interrupting the energisation of the movable
abutment (20) after rotation of the blades on to the

secondary stationary abutment so as to prevent the
accidental return of the blades to their initial

position in the event of a malfunctioning of the
locking system.
A process according to claim 12 or 13,
characterised in that it comprises, in the event of

simultaneous malfunctionings of the bolt (14) and
movable abutments (20), energising the electric motor

to produce a rotating magnetic field in order to lock
the blades permanently on a mechanical abutment.
