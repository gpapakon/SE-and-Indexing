<ABSTRACT>
DNA construct for use in transforming plant cells which comprises an exogenous coding sequence with upstream promoter and downstream terminator sequences, the promoter being a DNA sequence homologous to the DNA control sequence found upstream of a gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, for example the gene encoding phytoene synthase. The invention also includes plant cells containing such constructs and plants derived therefrom. Plants according to the invention may be stimulated to express the exogenous coding sequences by application of ethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EXPRESSION OF GENES IN TRANSGENIC PLANTSThe present invention relates to the expression of genes in transgenic plants. In particular it is concerned with the isolation and use of DNA sequences which control the expression of foreign genes in ripening fruits and in response to ethylene.The ability to isolate and manipulate plant genes has opened the way to gain understanding about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of plant gene expression. This knowledge is important for the exploitation of genetic engineering techniques to applied problems such as the expression of genes in genetically manipulated crop plants exhibiting improved quality and production characteristics. Many examples are now in the literature of plant DNA sequences which have been used to drive the expression of foreign genes in plants. In most instances the regions immediately 5' to the coding regions of genes have been used in gene constructs. These regions are referred to as promoter sequences. They may be derived from plant DNA; or from other sources, eg, viruses. It has been demonstrated that sequences up to 500-1000 bases in most instances are sufficient to allow for the regulated expression of foreign genes. This regulation has involved tissue-specificity, regulation by external factors such as light, heat treatment, chemicals, hormones, and developmental regulation. However, it has also been shown that sequences much longer than 1 kb may have useful features which permit high levels of gene expression in transgenic plants.These experiments have been carried out using gene fusions between the promoter sequences and foreign genes such as bacterial promoter genes, etc. This has led to the identification of useful promoter sequences. In work leading to the present invention we have identified a gene which expresses an enzyme involved in the ripening of 

 tomatoes. We have now shown that it is involved in carotenoid synthesis. The gene in question is encoded (almost completely) in the clone pTOM5, disclosed by Ray et al (Nucleic Acids Research, 15, 10587, 1989). Hereinafter this gene is referred to as the phytoene synthase (or PS) gene; the enzyme for which the pTOM5 gene codes is the pTOM5 gene product. We have shown that the pTOM5 gene is involved in the step or steps of the pathway between geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and phytoene, and that the pTOMS gene product is the enzyme known as phytoene synthase. Among the products produced by this branch of the pathway are carotenes, lutein, xanthophylls, and pigments such as
