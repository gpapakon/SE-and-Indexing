<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing a composite material 
of glass matrix carbon fibre, and related 

products is described. The process consists of 
the following successive stages: 


a) coating, in an inert environment, of a large 
number of carbon strands with a layer of melted 

glass; 
b) cutting of the coated strands in pieces of the 
required length; 
c) disposition and alignment of the pieces on a 
work surface; 
d) application of a thermal load capable of 
bringing the glass to its softening temperature 

thus obtaining a layer of carbon and glass fibre 
composite material; 
e) direct pressure thermoforming of a large 
number of layers of said composite material thus 

obtaining an object made of the carbon and glass 
fibre composite material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a process for 
manufacturing a carbon fibre composite material, 
and related products; In the search for materials with a high modulus 
of elasticity and reduced weight, the 
manufacturing of composite materials made of 
carbon fibres impregnated with glass is being 
studied, as is the use of carbon fibre 
impregnated with thermosetting resin such as 
epoxy resin. Recently there have been various attempts at 
obtaining a mixed fabric of carbon fibre and 
glass by heating the carbon fibre and glass to 
the glass softening temperature followed by 
direct compression molding after a light 
composite material with a high modulus of 
elasticity has been obtained. These attempts have failed due to the fact 
that, at the glass softening temperature the 
carbon fibres burn in the presence of oxygen. One solution to this problem is to soak the 
carbon fibres in melted glass in order to form a 
glass coating around the carbon fibre before 
carrying out the molding operation; even in this  
 
case, however, carbon oxidation, at the 
temperature of the melted glass used to cover the 
carbon fibres, has to be avoided. The aim of this invention is to manufacture a 
material of the above mentioned type by avoiding 
the exposure of the carbon fibres to high 
temperatures in the presence of oxygen. Another aim of this invention is to propose a 
process for the manufacturing said composite 
material paying particular attention to the 
coating of the fibres with glass before joining 
them to a glass matrix by molding. To achieve these and other aims, which will 
become clear from the following description, this 
invention proposes a process for the 
manufacturing of a carbon fibre glass matrix 
composite material, characterized in that it 
consists of the following successive stages: 
a) coating, in an inert environment, of a large 
number of carbon strands with a layer of melted 
glass; b) cutting of the coated strands in pieces of the 
required length; c) disposition and alignment of the pieces on a 
work surface;  d) application of thermal load of bringing the 
glass to its softening temperature thus obtaining 
a layer of carbon and glass fibre composite 
material; e) direct pressure thermoforming of a large 
number of layers of said composite material thus 
obtaining an object made of the carbon and glass 
fibre composite material. A preferred embodiment of the invention will 
now be described by way of example only, with 
reference to the enclosed drawing which shows 
schematically a device
