<ABSTRACT>
In a wear-resistant, fibre-reinforced floor covering (1) with a substrate (7) and a layer of cork (2) and a binder (3) thereon, the layer of cork (2) and the binder (3) is arranged between the substrate (7) and a covering layer (6) and the three layers are bonded together by means of needled fibres (4), with the cork (2) in particle form. In order to produce this wear-resistant, fibre-reinforced floor covering, a core layer of cork particles is laid on a substrate, a covering layer is laid on the cork layer lying on the substrate, the three layers are needled together by retaining fibres taken from the covering layer and/or the substrate through the core layer containing cork particles through which they can be passed and, after needling, the floor covering is impregnated with a binder. This provides a floor covering suitable as a substitute for linoleum and which can, however, be made more elastic than linoleum.

Wear-resistant fibre-reinforced floor covering (1) with a carrier
layer (7) and a layer of cork (2) and a binder (3) applied to it,

characterised in that the layer of cork (2) and the binder (3) is arranged
between the carrier layer (7) and a covering layer (6) and the three layers

are joined together by means of needled fibres (4).
Floor covering according to claim 1, characterised in that the cork
(2) is present in the form of particles and has a grain size of from 0.01 to

10 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mm.
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the cork grains (2) are present in expanded form.
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that fibre aggregates (8) of fibres wound into balls are

arranged in the core layer in addition to the cork grains (2).
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that in addition to the cork grains (2) pieces (5) or strips

of plastics, e.g. polyethylene, in particular pieces or strips of
polyethylene scrap, are present.
Floor covering according to claim 5, characterised in that the
pieces (5) of plastics have a grain size of from 1 to 5 mm.
Floor covering according to claim 5, characterised in that the strips
of polyethylene, in particular of polyethylene film, have a length of from

to 10 mm. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the binder (3) is oil-based and in particular comprises

a linseed oil, wood oil or the like.
Floor covering according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the binder (3) is water-based.
Floor covering according to claim 9, characterised in that the
binder (3) is a latex, in particular a natural latex.
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the fibres project partially beyond the binder (3) on

the side opposite the carrier layer (7).
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the fibres of the covering layer (6), the carrier layer

(7) and the needled fibres (4) are enclosed by the binder (3).
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the floor covering (1) has an additional surface

binder coating (9).
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that fillers (5), in particular different-coloured pattern

pieces, are worked into the binder (3) and/or into the surface binder
coating (9).
Floor covering according to claim 14, characterised in that the
fillers (5) are in the form of particles. 
Floor covering according to claim 14 or 15, characterised in that
the fillers (5) are scrap materials and preferably comprise rendered-down

polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, needle-felted carpets or rubber.
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the floor covering (1) has a pattern, at least on the

covering layer side (6).
Method of manufacturing a wear-resistant fibre-reinforced floor
covering according to one of the foregoing claims, in which a core layer

of cork particles is arranged on a carrier layer and the layers are joined
together with a binder, characterised in that a covering layer is deposited

on the core layer lying on the carrier layer, the three layers are needled
together by fibres taken from the covering layer and/or the carrier layer

through the core layer containing piercable cork grains and at least the
cork is impregnated with a binder before or after the needling step.
Method according to claim 18, characterised in that the binder is
cross-linked at the latest after the needling step.
Method according to claim 18 or 19, characterised in that expanded
cork grains are introduced.
Method according to one of claims 18 to 20, characterised in that
after the needling step on the three layers and the possible subsequent

application of the binder the floor covering is passed through reducing
rollers and the binder is forced at least into the core layer, whereupon the

binder is cured and the cork grains are bonded together. 
Method according to one of claims 18 to 21, characterised in that
the needled and impregnated floor covering is pressed between reducing

rollers and the final thickness of the floor covering which is to be
produced is set before the binder is cured or cross-linked.
Method according to one of claims 18 to 22, characterised in that
oily or aqueous binder is applied to the needled floor covering.
Method according to one of claims 21 to 23, characterised in that
the floor covering treated with binder is rolled between the reducing

rollers to level the surface, after which the binder is cured.
Method according to one of claims 18 to 24, characterised in that
the surface of the floor covering is additionally structured with a pattern

and/or coloured.
The use of the floor covering according to one of claims 1 to 17 as
a floor covering instead of linoleum.
