<ABSTRACT>
A flange lock (10) for retaining a disc or blade on a spindle of a 
power tool and for facilitating removal therefrom, comprising a 

support member (22) for threadedly engaging a spindle of a power 
tool, a plurality of cam devices (30) mounted through the support 

member (22), a pressure plate (44) for applying pressure to a flange of a 
disc or blade to hold the disc or blade on the power tool, the 

pressure plate (44) including a cam surface (46) for bearing against the 
cam devices (30), and a housing for receiving the support member (22), 

the cam devices (30) and the pressure plate (44) and including means 
(14,34) for driving the cam devices (30) between an active position 

(Figure 3) in which the pressure plate (44) is held spaced from the 
support member (22) and an inactive position (Figure 2), wherein the 

flange lock (10) can be partially released to facilitate removal of a 
disc 

or blade from the spindle of the power tool by operating the drive 
means (14,34) to move the cam devices (30) into their inactive position 

and thereby allow pressure between the pressure plate (44) and the 
disc or blade to be reduced. Such a flange lock (10) is particularly 

useful for use with angle grinders and circular saws which, after use, 
often have their flange locks extraordinarily tight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flange locks for securing
rotary discs on to the spindles of power tools, such as a
grinding wheel on to the spindle of an angle grinder or a
circular saw blade on to the spindle of a circular saw.Conventionally the spindles of such tools are screw
threaded and the discs have been secured by a clamp nut
which is locked in place by a spanner and which must also be
released by use of the spanner. More recently flange locks
have been developed which can be safely secured and released
by hand without the use of a tool and examples of such
flange locks are to be found in US Patents Nos. 4850154,
4941790 and 5042207.In particular, European Patent Application 0,381,809, which
forms the base for the preamble of claim 1,
discloses a flange lock which comprises a support member for
threadedly engaging a spindle of a power tool having a
plurality of ramped castellations mounted thereon, a
pressure plate for applying pressure to a flange of a disc
or blade to hold that disc or blade on a power tool, the
pressure plate having a plurality of ramped castellations
mounted thereon which correspond to and mesh with the ramped
castellations on the support member, locking members mounted
on a spring loaded setting ring which releasably lock the
support member and pressure plate together and a housing for
receiving the support member, the pressure plate, locking
members and the spring loaded setting ring. When the
locking members are disengaged, the support member is able
to rotate in relation to the pressure plate resulting in the
co-operating ramped castellations either riding down or up
each other reducing or increasing the space between the
support member and the pressure plate. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an
improved flange lock which can be secured and released by
hand.To this end, the present invention provides a flange
lock for retaining a disc or blade on a spindle of a
power tool and for facilitating removal therefrom,
comprising
a support member for threadedly engaging a spindle
of a power tool,a pressure plate for applying pressure to a flange
of a disc or blade to hold the disc or blade on a power
tool, the pressure plate including at least one cam
surface, anda housing for receiving the support member the
pressure plate and a plurality of cam devices for bearing against the
cam surface or surfaces,
characterised in that;the plurality of cam devices is
rotatably mounted through the support member
and the housing is
rotatable relative to the support member such

<CLAIMS>
A flange lock for retaining a disc or blade on a

spindle of a power tool and for facilitating removal
therefrom, comprising;


a support member (22) for threadedly engaging a
spindle of a power tool,
a pressure plate (44) for applying pressure to a
flange of a disc or blade to hold the disc or blade on a

power tool, the pressure plate (44) including at least
one cam surface (48),
a housing (12) for receiving the support member (22)
and the pressure plate (44) and a plurality of cam devices

for bearing against the cam surface or surfaces (48, 48'),

characterised in that;
the plurality of cam devices
(30) is rotatably mounted through the support member (22)

and the housing (12) is rotatable relative to the support
member (22) such that rotation of the housing (12)

relative to the support member (22) actuates a drive
means for driving each of the cam devices (30) rotatably

between an active position in which the pressure plate
(44) is held spaced from the support member (22) and an

inactive position, in which said spacing is reduced.
A flange lock as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that the drive means includes a gear pinion (14) which

interacts with the cam devices (30) to rotate the cam
devices (30). 
A flange lock as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in
that the gear pinion (14) is integral with the housing

(12).
A flange lock as claimed in either of claims 2 or 3
characterised in that the gear pinion (14) interacts with

gear wheel sectors (34) attached to the cam devices (30).
A flange lock as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in
that the cam devices (30) each include a square stud (32)

which engage with a square aperture in its respective
gear wheel sector (34).
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the cam devices (30) are rotated

about 90Â° when moving from their active to their inactive
positions.
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the pressure plate (44) includes a

central bore (42) having flats (40) which abut flat walls
extending from the support member (22) to ensure that the

support member (22) and the pressure plate (44) do not
rotate independently.
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that a support member (22) includes a

central threaded aperture (24) for receiving a spindle of
a power tool.
A flange lock as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the support member (22) includes an

axial threaded stud (24) for engaging in a threaded bore
of a spindle of a power tool. 
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the cam surface (48) of the

pressure plate (44) comprises a circular rib.
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that each cam device (30) includes a

groove (52) having a profile complimentary to the cam
surface (48) of the pressure plate (44) such that, in

their inactive position the cam devices (30) straddle the
cam surface (48) of the pressure plate (44).
A flange lock as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9
characterised in that each cam device (30) includes a

helical cam profile (50') and the cam surface (48) of the
pressure plate (44) includes a plurality of corresponding

helical cam profiles (48') for interaction therewith.
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the support member (22) includes a

friction device (64) to ensure that the cam devices (30)
are in their active position before the flange lock is

tightened onto a spindle of a power tool.
A flange lock as claimed in Claim 9 characterised in
that the friction device (64) comprises a nylon plug in

the threaded portion of the support member.
A flange lock as claimed in any preceding claim
characterised in that the support member (22), the cam

devices (30) and the pressure plate (44) are held in the
housing (12) by means of a circlip (54) which engages a

groove (20) in the inside surface of the housing (12).
