<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for purifying polluted exhaust air by heterogeneous catalysis, comprising a nonmetallic gas-permeable support element which can be coiled, is provided with individual fibres coated with an adsorptive layer of a material and is joined sandwich-like to a heatable metallic cloth strip and the complete element having a catalyst material is arranged in a housing which is furnished with an inlet and an outlet through which the polluted gas can be fed and the purified gas can be lead off. The apparatus is characterised in that the support element for the coating substances is a strip (1) knitted from glass yarn, which strip is shaped, together with the metallic cloth strip (2) having the same width, spirally coiled on end to give a disc (6) having a central hole (3) and this disc (6) is coated with a zeolite molecular sieve known per se in powder form and catalyst material, preferably platinum, is implanted in this adsorptive layer by means of the sol-gel process known per se.

<CLAIMS>
A device for cleaning exhaust air which is laden with harmful substances
by means of heterogeneous catalysis, consisting of a non-metallic gas-permeable

carrier element (1) which is able to be coiled and which has individual fibres
coated with an adsorptively acting layer of a substance and which is connected in

the manner of a sandwich with a heatable metallic fabric band (2) and the
overall element, having a catalyst material, is arranged in a housing which is

provided with an inlet and an outlet, through which the gas, loaded with harmful
substances, is able to be supplied and the purified gas is able to be carried off,

characterised in that

the carrier element for the coating substances is a band (1) knitted from glass
yarn, the yarn being a filament yarn of individual glass fibres, which is coated

with a finish and which together with the metallic fabric band (2), which has the
same width and which is connected to a voltage source, wound standing upright

in a spiral shape is constructed into a disc (6) having a central hole (3) and this
disc (6) is coated with a zeolithic molecular screen, known per se, in powder

form and in this adsorptively acting layer, catalyst material, preferably platinum,
is implanted by means of the sol-gel method known per se and the disc (6) is

arranged in a cylindrically constructed housing and the housing has a perforated
inner casing (9) and outer casing (8) and the front faces are provided with a

cover (10, 11) closing the disc (6) and embracing the inner (9) and outer casings
(8), of which a cover (10) covers the central hole (3).
The device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the knitted material (1) has a right/right cross-weaving.
The device according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that
 
the zeolith which is used is hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic.
The device according to Claims 1-3,

characterised in that

the metallic fabric band (2) is provided at the ends with electrical connections
(4, 5) in the form of tongues which are connected with the voltage source.
The device according to one of the preceding Claims 1-4,

characterised in that

at least two, preferably up to six discs (6.1-6.6) are arranged lying one on the
other in the housing, separated in each case by a mica washer (7), and the discs

(6.1-6.6) lying on the exterior are covered by the covers (10, 11) closing the
front faces of the housing.
The device according to Claim 5,

characterised in that

always two discs (6.1 + 6.2, 6.3 + 6.4, 6.5 + 6.6) are connected electrically in
series and are connected in each case with a phase of a three-phase mains and

star-connected.
The device according to Claim 5,

characterised in that

the cover (10) covering the central hole (6) has a centrally arranged opening
(12) through which a rod is able to be inserted securing the module (13) on a

mounting.
