<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel class of peptidyl derivatives, to
processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine.In normal tissues, cellular connective tissue synthesis is offset by
extracellular matrix degradation, the two opposing effects existing in
dynamic equilibrium. Degradation of the matrix is brought about by the
action of proteinases released from resident connective tissue cells and
invading inflammatory cells, and is due, in part, to the activity of at least
three groups of metalloproteinases. These are the collagenases, the
gelatinases (or type-IV collagenases) and the stromelysins. Normally
these catabolic enzymes are tightly regulated at the level of their
synthesis and secretion and also at the level of their extracellular activity,
the latter through the action of specific inhibitors, such as α2-macroglobulins
and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase), which
form inactive complexes with metalloproteinases.The accelerated, uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissues by
metalloproteinase catalysed resorption of the extracellular matrix is a
feature of many pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis,
corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumour metastasis or invasion;
periodontal disease and bone disease. It can be expected that the
pathogenesis of such diseases is likely to be modified in a beneficial
manner by the administration of metalloproteinase inhibitors and
numerous compounds have been suggested for this purpose [for a
general review see Wahl, R.C. etal Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 25, 175-184,
Academic Press Inc., San Diego (1990)].Although numerous metalloproteinase inhibitors have been described,
many have not been suitable for further development as medicines since
they have lacked any useful activity when administered orally at 
pharmaceutically acceptable doses. What is therefore
needed is a potent and selective orally active compound with
a good duration of action.WO 92/09564 describes peptidyl derivatives that are
metalloproteinase inhibitors having selective gelatinase
action, and having formula (1)
