<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing water absorbent resin comprising a step of 

adding a high-molecular crosslinking agent which has at 
least 2 azetidinium salt groups in the molecule and has at 

least 1000 weight-average molecular weight to the water 
absorbent resin paticles having carboxylic groups and 

carboxylic acid salt groups and a step of efficiently 
crosslinking the vicinity of the surface of the water 

absorbent resin particles. In the process for producing 
water absorbent resin according to the present 
invention, 
the use of high-molecular crosslinking agent achieves less 

permeation of the crosslinking agent into the water 
absorbent resin particles and enables efficient 

crosslinking of the vicinitiy of the surface of the water 
absorbent resin particles. Consequently, the water 

absorbent resin having high water absorbency both under 
pressure-free state and under loading can be manufactured. 

Because the crosslinking agent contains a large amount of 
azetidinium salt groups highly reactive to carboxylic acid 

groups or carboxylic acid salt groups in the molecule, the 
water absorbent resin having high crosslinking efficiency, 

good safety, and good flowability can be manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing water absorbent resin. More specifically, it
relates to a process for producing water absorbent resin
having high water absorbency under loading and high
safety.Water absorbent resins have been extensively used for
hygienic materials such as paper diapers, sanitary
materials, etc. as a material which can replace pulp or
water absorbent paper, based upon its marvelous water
absorbency, as well as for applications as water retaining
material, water sealing material, etc. and food processing
applications making use of their characteristics.For water absorbent resins applied for hygienic
materials, neutralized salts of polyacrylic acid or
polymethacryl acid are generally used from the viewpoint
of composition. However, when they are used for paper
diapers, they should exhibit not only simply high water
absorbency under a pressure-free state (absorption rate of
urine at no load), but also high water absorbency under 
loading (absorption rate with load). In order to increase
the water absorbency under loading, the crosslinking
degree must be increased because the water absorbent resin
must absorb urine and other liquids while overcoming the
load. However, in the conventional method, if the dosage
of copolymerizable crosslinking agent is increased for
uniform crosslinking, the water absorbency under loading
is increased by the increase of crosslinking degree but
has a defect of decreasing the water absorbency under a
pressure-free state. This decreasing of the water
absorbency under pressure-free state restrains the
improvement of the water absorbency under loading.To solve this problem, methods have been proposed for
lowering the crosslinking degree of the inner part of the
water absorbent resin in order to maintain the water
absorbency under a pressure-free state, and crosslinking
the vicinity of the surface of a water absorbent resin
particle with a crosslinking agent having at least 2
functional groups which react with the carboxylic acid
group and/or carboxylic acid salt group. That is, surface
crosslinking methods have been proposed. In this event,
for the crosslinking agent, epoxy compounds represented by
ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, etc. (e.g.
JP-A-57-44627), polyhydric 
alcohols represented by glycerin (e.g.
JP-A-58-180233), polyvalent amine
compounds, polyaziridine compounds, or polyvalent
isocyanate compounds (e.g.
JP-A-59-189103), polyvalent epoxy compounds
having an amino group (e.g.
JP-A-63-199205), and reactants of epihalohydrin
