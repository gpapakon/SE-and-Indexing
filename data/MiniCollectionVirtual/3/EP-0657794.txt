<ABSTRACT>
The radiowaves including time data are received at 
receiving means (2, 3, 1). When the current time data 

in current time counting means (7) has been corrected by 
correction means (1) on the basis of the current time 

data obtained at the receiving means, it is judged 
whether or not an alarm time is present between the 

time data before correction and the time data after 
correction. If an alarm time is present, the user is 

informed of the alarm time. This avoids the problem of 
failing to inform the user of the alarm time at that 

day. Furthermore, the correspondence between the 
current time data in the current time counting means (7) 

and the time data in different functional means (20) is 
prevented from changing as follows when the current 

time data has been corrected on the basis of the 
received time data, the time data in the different 

functional means (20) is also corrected as much as the 
same correction time, or while the different functional 

means (20) is operating, the time correcting operation 
is prevented from being carried out even if the time 

correction timing has been reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a time data receiving
apparatus which receives the radiowaves containing a
time code, extracts time data from the radiowaves, and
corrects the time on the basis of the time data.At present, in Germany, England, Switzerland,
Japan, etc., where the radiowaves containing a time code
are being transmitted, radio-controlled timepieces have
been put to practical use which receive the radiowaves,
extract time data from the radiowaves, and corrects the
current time data in the current time count circuit on
the basis of the time data.Furthermore, for example, a radio-controlled
timepiece provided with an alarm function that goes off
at the alarm time previously set has been disclosed in
U.S. Pat. No. 5,083,123.In such a radio-controlled timepiece with an alarm
function, the alarm time data previously set is compared
with the current time data in the current time count
circuit every minute, and the alarm is given when they
coincide with each other.Therefore, even when a radiowave correction timing
has occurred immediately before the current time data in
the current time count circuit reaches the alarm time
data, and the received accurate time data becomes the
time data behind the alarm time, this time data will
still be used to correct the current time data in the 
current time count circuit. As a result, the alarm time
has passed, so that the coincidence of the alarm time
data with the current time data in the current time
count circuit cannot be sensed, and consequently the
user is not informed of the alarm time.The idea has been proposed that such a
radio-controlled timepiece is provided with a timer
function of informing the user when the preset time has
been reached.A case will be considered where the elapsed time is
measured using a radio-controlled timepiece with such a
timer function.For example, it is assumed that the user plans to
start specific work at 4:50 p.m. and end at 5:20, sets
the timer for 30 minutes, and starts the timer function
at 4:50 to inform him at 5:20.In the case where the radiowaves containing a time
code is received at 5:00, the time data is extracted
from the radiowaves, and the current time data in the
current time count circuit is corrected on the basis of
the time data, when the user is informed after the time
set in the timer has elapsed, the current time data in
the current time count circuit is other than 5:20 and
consequently the time different from 5:20 is displayed.
For this reason, the user may think that he must have
set the wrong time in the
