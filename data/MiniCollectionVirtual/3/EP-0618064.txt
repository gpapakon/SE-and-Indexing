<ABSTRACT>
Splicing machine, in particular for the overlapped splicing of cord band strips of steel or textile cord, in which a strip (45) is conveyed by a conveyor belt (2) up to the edge of the spliced cord band (37) and is bonded to the latter by moving together between an upper splicing bar (13) and a lower splicing box (14), having a first correcting device, by means of which the upper splicing bar and the lower splicing box are aligned parallel to the edge (38) of the spliced cord band, the splicing bar and the splicing box being swivelled with respect to the stationary cord band, and a second correcting device, by means of which the edge (44) to be spliced of the strip is aligned parallel to the edge (38) of the cord band, the alignment taking place by mechanical displacing of the strip with respect to the stationary cord band edge.

Splicing machine for the overlapping splicing of corded flat strip composed of 
steel or of a textile, in which the leading edge of a strip is brought up to the trailing 

edge of the spliced corded strip by means of a conveyor belt and, by moving the two 
ends together between an upper splicing strip and a lower splicing box, is joined to 

said splicing box, the edges, the splicing strip and the splicing box being aligned 
with one another by means of an adjusting device, characterised in that the splicing 

strip (13) and the splicing box (14) are capable of being aligned parallel to the rear 
edge (38) of the spliced corded strip (37) by means of a first adjusting device, the 

splicing strip (13) and the splicing box (14) being swivelled relative to the rear edge 
(38) of the stationary corded strip (37), and in that the leading edge (44) of the strip 

(25) is capable of being aligned parallel to the trailing edge (38) of the stationary 
corded strip by means of a second adjusting device, the leading edge (44) (whose 

position is not known) undergoes a non-specific machine-operated relative 
displacement dependent only on the position of the trailing edge (38) until it 

assumes its final position, which is determined by the trailing edge (38) of the 
stationary corded strip (37) and which is detected by sensor elements disposed on 

the splicing strip (13) and/or the splicing box (14). 
Splicing machine according to claim 1, characterised by a lower splicing table 
(12) rotatable via a drive (7), on which table the splicing strip and the splicing box 

(14) are disposed, and by a rotatably mounted upper splicing table (11) which 
supports the corded strip (37) and the strip (45) and which is centred with the lower 

splicing table (12) via two pressure springs (34), the tables being pivotable relative 
to one another against the pressure of the spring. 
Splicing machine according to claim 2, characterised in that the upper splicing 
table (11) is capable of being detachably clamped by a clamping device, preferably 

a clamping cylinder (36). 
Splicing machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised by one or more 
further sensor elements, which are disposed on the splicing strip and/or the splicing 

box and/or optionally to the splicing table and which are for detecting the position of 
the edge (38) of the spliced corded strip (37).  

 
Splicing machine according to claim 4, characterised by a first sensor (42) in 
controlling connection with a conveyor belt (3) and disposed on the upper face (18) 

of the splicing box (14) and discharging the spliced corded strip (37). 
Splicing machine according to claim 4 or 5, characterised by a second sensor 
(43) disposed on the splicing strip (17) and in controlling connection with the drive 

(7) of the lower splicing table (12). 
Splicing machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised by one or more 
clamping elements, in particular pincers, which detachably clamp, convey and/or 

align the strip being supplied. 
Splicing machine according to claim 7, characterised by a first pincer (40), 
preferably pair of pincers, which acts laterally on the strip (45) supplied and which is 

movable via a first drive in and perpendicular (H) to the strip conveying direction (G) 
in such a manner that the strip (45) is conveyable with the pincers (40) in the 

clamping position. 
Splicing machine according to claim 8, characterised in that a measuring sensor 
(48) for detecting the position of the longitudinal edge (49) of the strip (45) is 

disposed on the first pincer (40). 
Splicing machine according to one of claims 7 to 9, characterised by a second 
pincer (41), which is disposed substantially opposite the first pincer (40), is movable 

and rotatable via a second drive in and perpendicular (I) to the conveying direction 
(G) of the strip (45), and clamps the strip (45) laterally so as to convey the strip. 
Splicing machine according to claim 10, characterised in that a stop guiding the 
strip (45) is disposed on the second pincer (41). 
Splicing machine according to one of claims 7 to 11, characterised in that the 
first and/or the second pincer drive is coupled to the conveyor belt (2), preferably via
