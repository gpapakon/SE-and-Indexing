<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyimide resins, a class 
of organic polymers known for their outstanding thermo-oxidative 
stability. Polyimide resins are used to form the matrix of 
fiber-reinforced composite materials. These types of 
composite materials are increasingly used as the preferred 
structural materials in military and civil applications such 
as jet engine cowls and ducts, because of their light-weight 
and load-bearing characteristics and their oxidative stability 
at temperatures between 500 and 700°F (260 and 371°C). Upper use temperature in conjunction with processing 
cost considerations determine the true value of a polyimide. 
Glass transition temperature (Tg) and thermo-oxidative 
stability are key determinants of upper use temperature. In 
order to use a polyimide composite for a load bearing 
application at a given temperature, the resin must have a Tg 
substantially above that given temperature, otherwise the 
resin will soften and the composite will undergo creep. 
Thermo-oxidative stability is commonly measured as the percent 
weight loss during long term aging at high temperatures in an 
oxidative environment. Materials that rapidly lose weight have 
a short use life at that temperature.  
 Processing costs include cost of monomers, handling 
costs, and fabrication costs. Ideally, the polyimide resin 
should be prepared from low cost, minimally hazardous, 
starting chemicals. It should be readily converted into fiber 
reinforced prepreg tapes. Most importantly the prepreg tapes 
must be easily molded into void-free parts in standard 
composite fabrication equipment known as an autoclave. 
Materials that have insufficient flow under 200 psi (1.38 MPa), the 
maximum operating pressure for the vast majority of 
autoclaves, have little commercial utility. Polyimides are generally prepared either through 
direct condensation reactions to afford linear, long chain, 
polyimides, or through addition reactions performed on end-capped 
imide oligomers to give crosslinked polyimides. In 
both cases, it is well known that high stability is conferred 
by the use of aromatic or heteroaromatic moieties, while the 
use of aliphatic moieties reduces thermal-oxidative stability. Condensation type polyimides have the highest 
thermal-oxidative stability because aliphatic end caps (which 
are used in addition type polyimides) are not used. 
Condensation type polyimides are typically prepared by 
treating an aryl dianhydride with an aryl diamine in an 
aprotic solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidinone,
