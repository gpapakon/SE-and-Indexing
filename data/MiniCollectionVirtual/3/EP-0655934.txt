<ABSTRACT>
Described is a pressure filter with a liquid space having a liquid feed inlet and at least one filter surface with a multiplicity of apertures, one side of the filter surface being bounded by the liquid space while the other side is bounded by a filtrate space with a filtrate discharge outlet, the device also having a back-flushing device. The back-flushing device has a head which passes over the filter surface and seals off part of the filter surface with respect to the liquid space. The back-flushing head delimits a back-flushing space with at least one suction chamber which presents a slit-like opening towards the filter surface and to which a reject line is connected. The filter has two filter surfaces at the end of a boss. Rotatably mounted in the boss is a hollow shaft whose ends are each linked to a back-flushing head and whose cylindrical body is coupled to a drive unit located outside the liquid space. The ends of space inside the hollow shaft are connected to the spaces in the back-flushing heads, while the space inside the body of the shaft is connected to the reject line. The filter does not have to have its own pressure housing and, if fitted with a suitable support pipe, can be installed in any container.

A pressure filter comprising a fluid compartment (21)
with a fluid inlet (18), at least two filter surfaces

having a plurality of openings within the fluid
compartment (21), one side of the filter surfaces

being delimited by the fluid compartment (21) and the
other side thereof being delimited by a filtrate

compartment having a filtrate outlet (19), and at
least two backwashing means having each a slat-like or

plate-like backwashing head sweeping over the filter
surface and sealing a part of the filter surface with

respect to the fluid compartment (21), the backwashing
head delimiting a backwashing compartment having at

least one suction chamber open to the filter surface
in a slot-like manner and connected to a reject

discharge line (25), wherein a hollow shaft (9) is
rotatably supported within the filter and is connected

to at least two backwashing heads and a drive means
(11) disposed outside of the fluid compartment (21),

the interior space of the hollow shaft being connected
to the backwashing compartments of the backwashing

heads and to the reject discharge line (25),
characterized in that the filter surfaces are disposed

within the front side range of a hub (23), the hollow
shaft (9) is rotatably supported within the hub (23)

and is connected to a respective backwashing head at 
its front sides and to the drive means (11) at its

cylindrical portion, and the interior space of the
hollow shaft (9) is connected to the backwashing

compartments of the backwashing heads at its front
sides and is connected to the reject discharge line

(25) in its cylindrical portion.
The pressure filter according to claim 1,
characterized in that the hub (23) has a hollow space

surrounding the hollow shaft (9) and connected to the
reject discharge line (25) and connected to the

interior space of the hollow shaft (9) through at
least one opening in the wall of the hollow shaft.
The pressure filter according to claim 2,
characterized in that a venting line (17) is connected

to the hollow space in the hub (23).
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a drive shaft (10)

disposed within a protection tube (24) extends from
the drive means (11) to a hollow space of the hub (23)

and is connected to the hollow shaft (9) there.
The pressure filter according to claim 4,
characterized in that the drive shaft (10) and the

hollow shaft (9) each have a dish gear or bevel gear
meshing with one another.
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the hollow shaft (9) is

connected to the backwashing heads by means of hollow
connection pieces connected to the backwashing heads

and to the hollow shaft (9) in a rotatably fixed
manner. 
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the filter portion

enclosing the filtrate compartment is fixed to a
filter housing (3) by means of ribs (28).
The pressure filter according to one of the claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the filter portion

enclosing the filtrate compartment is fixed to a
support means by means of a carrier tube (30).
The pressure filter according to claim 8,
characterized in that the carrier tube (30) takes up

the drive shaft (10) and the reject discharge line
(25).
The pressure filter according to one of the claims 8
or 9, characterized in that the carrier tube (10) is

fixed to a man hole cover (31).
The pressure filter according to one of the claims 8
to 10, characterized in that the pressure filter does

not have an own housing.
