<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a quality-control sieve which is highly reliable in operation and which is particularly suitable for installation in a pneumatically driven conveyor line. The material to be sieved is distributed uniformly, in a first zone (A), over the whole peripheral surface of the mesh (11) of the sieve. In the adjacent zone (B), the coarse particles are completely separated out and removed through an outlet. A centrifugal rotor (7) with elastic cleaning fins (23) disposed in a spiral so that they project out from the rotor bars (22) ensures a high throughput and particularly careful removal of even large foreign bodies.

Quality-control sieve, in particular with a pneumatic 
material supply means (1), a sieve housing (16), a cylindrical 

mesh (11) with a centrifugal rotor (7) revolving therein, an 
outlet (12) for material rejected by the sieve and an outlet 

(21) for the undersize, wherein the centrifugal rotor (7) has 
several rotor bars (22) extending substantially over the 

entire length of the mesh (11) with radially projecting 
conveying and cleaning fins (23) which are preferably formed 

from elastic material and operate in the vicinity of the mesh, 

characterised in that the conveying and cleaning fins (23) are 
arranged on the same rotor bar (22) with longitudinal spacing 

from one another, with an offset arrangement from the next 
rotor bar (22) for forming a helical conveying component from 

the inlet into the mesh (11) to the outlet (12) for material 
rejected by the sieve. 
Quality-control sieve according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the conveying and cleaning fins (23) consist of an 

elastomeric material and easily contact the internal surface 
of the mesh (11). 
Quality-control sieve according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the material supply means (1) is designed as a 

rotatable housing (4) with an inlet nozzle (3) opening 
radially or tangentially to the axis of rotation of the 

centrifugal rotor (7). 
Quality-control sieve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a distribution section (A) is formed 

within the mesh (11), for example in the first third, for the 
mechanical uniform distribution of the material at the inlet 

into the mesh (11) directly over the entire circumference of 
the sieve.  

 
Quality-control sieve according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the distribution section (A) is limited by a co-revolving 

baffle plate (24) and the outlet (12) for material 
rejected by the sieve is formed by an elastic disk (13). 
Use of the quality-control sieve according to claims 1 to 
5 for the quality-control sieving of flour-like materials.
