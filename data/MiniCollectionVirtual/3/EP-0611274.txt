<ABSTRACT>
In a holder (1), on which disc-like articles are supported on a gas cushion which is formed according to the Bernoulli principle from a compressed gas emerging from a nozzle (12) in the surface of the holder facing the article, cams (45) are provided all around as lateral stops for the disc-like article. The cams (45) are arranged eccentrically on shafts (44) which can be rotated in the holder (1). The shafts (44) can be rotated with the aid of a toothed ring (40) received in the holder for the radial displacement of the cams (45). The space (31, 33), in which the toothed ring (40) is received, is separated and sealed in relation to the space (50, 53, 54), through which the compressed gas flows to the nozzle (12). It is thus prevented that the flow of the gas through the displacement mechanism for the cams (45) is adversely affected and that abrasion material is carried along and blown out of the nozzle (12) by the gas against the article to be treated.

Holder (1) according to the Bernoulli principle for
disc-shaped articles, with at least one nozzle (12),

disposed in the circumferential area of the holder (1),
in the surface of the holder (1) facing the article to

which compressed gas is supplied, to form a gas cushion
between the holder (1) and the disc-shaped article, and

with stops disposed in the circumferential area of the
face of the holder (1) facing the article, for lateral

support of the disc-shaped article, said stops being
formed by cams (45), which are disposed on shafts (44)

rotatably mounted in the holder (1) and eccentric to
their axis of rotation, the shafts (44) carrying pinions

(43), which mesh with a gear ring (40) mounted to rotate
in a space of said holder about its central axis (11),

the gear ring (40) being coupled to the carrier shaft
(2), on one end of which the holder (1) is provided, the

compressed gas flowing through the hollow carrier shaft
(2) via a space in the holder (1) to the nozzle (12), a

rotational drive (3) engaging in order to rotate the
holder (1) on the carrier shaft (2) at a distance above

its end lying opposite the carrier (1), there being
associated with the holder (1) a brake, and the holder

(1) consisting of a basic member (20), which sits on the
carrier shaft (2), of an annular member (21), in which 

the shafts (44) of the cams (45) are mounted to rotate,
and of a central member (22), which together with the

annular member (21) defines the nozzle (12) at its outer
edge, characterised in that the space through which

compressed gas is supplied to the nozzle (12), is formed
by a blind hole (50) in the centre of the central member

(22), into which the free end of the support shaft (2)
engages, by two or more ducts (53) leading outwards from

this blind hole (50), in the central member (22), and of
an annular space (54) provided between the annular member

(21) and the central member (22), in that the space (31),
in which the gear ring (40) is accommodated for actuating

the cams (45), is defined by surfaces (25,32) facing one
another of the basic member (20) and of the central

member (22) and radially towards the centre by the
carrier shaft (2), and in that the gear ring (40) extends

radially outwith this space (31) into a slot-shaped space
(33) between the basic member (30) and the annular member

(21), so that the space (50,53,54) which leads to the
nozzle (12) is a space separated from the space (31,32)

in which the gear ring (40) is housed.
Holder according to claim 1, characterised in that
the space (31,33) accommodating the gear ring (40) is

separated by a seal (52) from the space (50,53,54)
leading to the nozzle (12) and charged with compressed

gas, and is not charged with compressed gas. 
Holder according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that it is a holder (1) for silicon discs during etching

of the same.
Holder according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the nozzle (12) disposed in the

circumferential area of the holder (1) is annular.
Holder according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the surface of the holder (1)
facing the article is circular.
Holder according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the rotational drive (3) for the

holder (1) is a gearwheel-synchronous belt drive (5,6,7).
Holder according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the annular member (21) has a step

(27) facing the central member (22), and against which
abuts a shoulder (26) of the central member (22), and in

that the central member (22) is connected to the basic
member (20), and holds the annular member (21) against

the basic member (20).
Holder according to claim 7, characterised in that a
plurality of slide blocks (46) are provided in the basic

member (20) for guiding the gear ring (40). 
Holder according to claim 8, characterised in that
the slide blocks (46) consist of Teflon.
Holder according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in
that the slide blocks (46) guide the gear ring (40) in

its areas remote from the carrier shaft (2).
Holder according to one of claims 2 to 10,
characterised in that the seal (52) is disposed between

the open end of the blind hole (50) in the central member
(22) and the free end of the carrier shaft (2).
