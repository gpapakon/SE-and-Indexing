<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for heat treating food products by means of a fluid, such as hot steam air, steam or steam-air mixtures, the amount of energy transmitted to the fluid can be controlled via the energy absorption of the food products. Here, the energy absorption of the food products is to be determined, for example, via temperature difference between two measured points. This is preferably effected by at least two temperature sensors (19, 20) which are provided in a treatment space (5) for the food products. The temperature sensors (19, 20) are arranged here, in particular, in air-guiding ducts (21, 22).
