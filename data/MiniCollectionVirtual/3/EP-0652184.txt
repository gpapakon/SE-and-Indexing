<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing a preform for a silica glass multiferrule, the preform consisting of a piece of silica glass exhibiting a plurality of mutually parallel lengthwise channels. A slip comprising a suspension of silica soot is prepared; it is cast into a mould (1) made of plastic containing calibrated removable rods (2). After drying and densification the preform obtained can be made into fibre.

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a multi-ferrule blank out of silica glass, the 
blank being constituted by a silica glass part having a plurality of 

mutually parallel longitudinal channels, and the method being 
characterized by the fact that it comprises the following operations: 


preparing a slip having at least 50% by weight synthetic silica 
with specific area of not less than 40 m
2
/g, and an additive selected 
from among ammonium fluoride, ammonium bifluoride at a concentration 

of not less than 2% by weight, or hydrofluoric acid at a 
concentration of not more than 0.1 moles per liter; 
casting said slip into a cylindrical mold made of plastics 
material and containing a plurality of removable rods of circular or 

lozenge section at the locations of said channels; 
allowing to set at room temperature; 
drying for at least 8 hours at a temperature of not more than 
60°C; 
unmolding; and 
applying densification heat treatment in the range 1300°C to 
1450° for a period lying in the range 1 hour to 3 hours in a vacuum 

or in an atmosphere of helium.
