<ABSTRACT>
A push-pull converter (GW) having a preregulator (VR) is equipped with two push-pull resonant circuits (C1, C2) in order to achieve high efficiency. Means for decoupling (Sp, g1, g2) the push-pull paths as far as alternating currents are concerned are provided in order to prevent equalisation currents between the push-pull paths of the push-pull converter (GW). The arrangement according to the invention is particularly suitable for supplying power stages (output stages) where high efficiency is required, for example for travelling wave tube amplifiers in satellites.

Arrangement comprising a push-pull converter (GW) 
having at least one resonance capacitor (C1, C2) in each 

push-pull path, and having an upstream, pulsed preregulator 
(VR) which contains at least one storage 

inductance, characterized in that an inductor, in 
particular in the form of an economy transformer (Sp) 

having push-pull windings (g1, g2), is provided between 
the preregulator (VR) and the push-pull paths of the 

push-pull converter (GW) to provide AC decoupling of the 
push-pull paths (C1 w1; C2, w2) which are connected 

indirectly or directly in DC terms, the one set of 
winding ends leading to in each case one of the push-pull 

paths, and the other set of winding ends being connected 
directly or indirectly to the preregulator (VR). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the push-pull windings (g1, g2) are designed to 

be DC-isolated from one another, and in that their ends 
facing away from the push-pull paths are connected to one 

another in DC terms at least via parts (L2, L3) of the 
preregulator (VR). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the DC connection of the push-pull windings (g1, 

g2) is produced via two inductance elements (L2, L3) of 
the preregulator (VR), which is designed in particular as 

a step-down or step-up controller. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the push-pull windings (g1, g2) are 

connected to damping means (R1; R2, R3). 
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the damping means (R2, R3) are designed such that  

 
power can be output via them and represents a balanced 

load on the push-pull paths of the push-pull converter 
(GW). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that further push-pull windings (g3, g4) 

are connected to the push-pull windings (g1, g2) in order 
to output power for a secondary circuit.
