<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a herbicidal composition in the form of an aqueous concentrated microemulsion comprising: (a) a herbicidal active component consisting of a combination of a C1-C8 alkyl ester of 2-(4-(2'-fluoro-4'-cyanophenoxy)phenoxy)propionic acid and a water soluble salt of 3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazine-4-(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide; (b) ethoxylated styrylphenol as a surfactant; (c) one or more organic solvents selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, fatty acid esters and aromatic carboxylic acid esters; and (d) water. The composition exhibits a good prolonged storage stability both at high and low temperatures, is transparent and uniform, and useful as a herbicide for paddy field.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a herbicidal composition 
in the form of an aqueous microemulsion and more 
particularly to a herbicidal composition in the form of 
an aqueous microemulsion containing as an active component 
a specified alkyl ester of a fluorophenoxyphenoxyalkanoic 
acid and water soluble salts of Bentazone. Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 
66156/1989 discloses that some fluorophenoxyphenoxyalkanoic 
acids and derivatives thereof are useful as 
selective herbicides for controlling weeds such as barnyard 
grass (Echinochloa crus-galli P. Beauv.) in farmlands 
where there grow useful crops such as broad leaf 
vegetables and wheat, barley and especially rice plant. 
As described in the publication, the compounds together 
with inert additives commonly used can be used as formulations 
such as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable 
powders and granules. On the other hand, Bentazone (3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazine-4-(3H)-one 
2,2-dioxide) and salts 
thereof are herbicides that are used widely as herbicides 
for broad leaf weeds, and in Japan Bentazone sodium salt 
solutions are commercially available and commonly used. 
However, the compounds are inactive on barnyard grass 
which are strong weeds for paddy field rice crop and, 
hence, it is necessary to use the compound in combination 
with other herbicides that are active on barnyard grass. Oil soluble active components of agricultural 
chemicals such as the above-described fluorophenoxyphenoxyalkanoic 
acids and derivatives thereof are usually 
formulated into emulsions together with organic solvents  
 
and emulsifiers and therefore, it has been impossible to 
obtain uniform mixtures with aqueous formulations such as 
Bentazone sodium salt solutions. As a method for preparing 
an aqueous formulation from an oily agricultural 
active component, there have been developed various 
methods in which concentrated aqueous emulsion formulations 
(EW) are prepared as described in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 4799/1966, Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publication Nos. 80306/1982, 169401/1982, 169403/1982, 
162504/1983, 162505/1983, 11850/1983, 39810/1984, 
37707/1986, etc. However, these formulations are thermally 
unstable and, hence, it has been difficult to 
obtain high enough a stability to endure a prolonged 
storage and a wide temperature variation. As a countermeasure 
for solving this problem, there have been developed 
microemulsion formulations (of. Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. 13696/1978, 17721/1983, 29761/1983 and
