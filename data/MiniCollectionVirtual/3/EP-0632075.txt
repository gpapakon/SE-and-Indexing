<ABSTRACT>
Star polymers of isoprene or butadiene having terminal
hydroxyl groups have reduced viscosity when the hydroxyl groups are

located on poly-meric arms that are grown from the core of the star
molecules. The polymers are useful in making coatings, sealants,

and binders.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diene based star polymers suitable 
for crosslinking and to adhesive, sealant, and coating compositions 
made from the star polymers. Diene based polymers having low viscosity can be used without 
solvents to make coatings and related compositions as disclosed in 
several United States Patents. For unsaturated 1,3-butadiene 
polymers it is known that high 1,4-addition obtains low viscosity 
as taught in U.S. Patents 4,518,753 and 3,652,732. However, when 
the polymers described in these patents are hydrogenated the 
products are crystalline solids. Such a crystalline hydrogenated 
diene polymer having terminal hydroxyl groups is available from 
Mitsubishi and is designated POLYTAIL H polymer which has a melting 
point of 72Â°C. The hydrogenated butadiene polymers are non-crystalline when 
the 1,4-addition of butadiene is below 70% as stated in United 
States Patent No. 4,020,125. The non-crystalline hydrogenated 
butadiene polymers are viscous liquids at low molecular weights as 
described in United States Patents Nos. 4,866,120 and 4,020,125. 
POLYTAIL HA polymer produced by Mitsubishi and NISSO GI-2000 
polymer produced by Nippon Soda are commercial examples of low 
molecular weight hydrogenated butadiene polymers which have 
terminal hydroxyl groups and 1,4-addition of about 16%. Star polymers having three or more polymeric arms of a diene 
connected to a central nucleus are known in the art as described in 
Canadian Patent No. 716,645 and United States Patent No. 3,985,830. 
The star polymers are also useful as low viscosity components for 
coatings as evidenced by the fact that several diene polymers 
described in Example 3 of United States Patent 3,652,732 are 
inherently mixtures of star diene polymers and linear diene 
polymers. The star diene polymers facilitate crosslinking of the  
 
diene polymers. However, the diene polymers have at least 80% 
1,4-addition and are crystalline solids after hydrogenation. The termination of living anionic polymers to form functional 
end groups useful for adhesives, sealants, and coatings is 
described in United States Patents 4,417,029, 4,518,753, and 
4,753,991. Capping of anionic polymers with hydroxyl, carboxyl, 
amine, epoxy, and phenolic groups is known. Of particular interest 
for the present invention are diene polymers having terminal 
functional groups for production of coatings. It is an object of the present invention to provide star 
diene polymers having terminal functional groups and low viscosity 
at room temperature.
