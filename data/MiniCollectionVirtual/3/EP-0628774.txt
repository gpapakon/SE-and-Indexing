<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heater (heating boiler), comprising a water-carrying housing which is penetrated by a flue (4) reaching through the housing (8) and carrying the heating gases, and said flue being of double-walled construction and the inner wall (1) being provided with longitudinal ribs (9) directed radially inwards. In order to be able to manufacture such a boiler with a minimum of welding work on the flue (4) and the inner wall (1), said flue is constructed according to the invention in such a way that the flue-side rib interstices (2) of the inner wall (1), which is folded to form the longitudinal ribs (9) or formed from u-sections, are covered at their two end regions (1') with weld seams (3) which are very short in relation to the overall length of the inner wall, connect the foot regions of the rib interstices (2) and do not project beyond the outer circumferential surface of the inner wall (1), and that the flue (4) encloses the inner wall (1) in a cold-stressed manner, bearing against the latter.

A boiler, comprising a water-carrying casing traversed by a tubing (4) passing through 
the casing (8) and guiding the heating gases, with the tubing (4) being of a dual-walled 

configuration and the inner wall (1) of the tubing (4) being in the form of radially 
inwardly directed dual-layered longitudinal fins (9), with the tubing-sided fin spandrels 

(2) of the dual-layered longitudinal fins (9) being provided with welding seams (3) not 
protruding beyond the outer circumferential face of the inner wall (1), and with the 

tubing (4) in abutting relationshiop with the inner wall (1) cold-clamping the latter, 
characterized in that the welding seams (3) are arranged on the end areas of the inner 

wall (1) by a length which relative to the total length ofthe inner wall is very short. 
A boiler according to claim 1, characterized in that arranged centrally between the 
welded end areas (1'), at least in some of the fin spandrels (2), are correspondingly short 

welding seams (3'). 
A boiler according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the sheet blank (Z) forming 
the tubing (4) on one of its ends (5) includes an edge (6) cranked out by the sheet 

strength, with the edge (6) overlapping the other end edge (7) of the blank (Z), and with 
the free end (6') thereof being welded to the other end edge (7). 
A boiler according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the folded or bent 
sheet material, in the area of the fin spandrel (2) externally of the short welding seams (3) 

is of an approximately rectangular configuration, and that in the area of the welding 
seams (3) the spandrels, in cross-section, are substantially larger than the small fin 

spandrels (2) in the non-welded areas (5).  
 
A boiler according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that welded to at least 
one end of the inner wall (1) shorter than the tubing (4) and formed by the longitudinal 

fins (9), is a ring (14) corresponding in width to the difference in length and comprising a 
centrally circumferential and inwardly directed bead (13) with the outer diamter of the 

said ring (14) corresponding to the inner wall (1), and that the ring (14) is connected to 
the circumferential edge (1') of the tubing (4) which with the other edge (1") thereof is 

in communication with the other end edge of the inner wall (1). 
A boiler according to claim 5, characterized in that the bead (13) is of a greater height 
than width, with the legs (13') thereof being arranged in parallel or approximately 

parallel with respect to one another. 
A boiler according to claims 5 or 6, characterized in that the short welding seams (3) 
are replaced by the connecting weld points between ring (14) and inner wall (1).
