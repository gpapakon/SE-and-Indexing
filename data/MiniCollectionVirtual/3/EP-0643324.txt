<ABSTRACT>
A photographic processing apparatus capable of 
printing films having different widths. An exposure unit 

for printing film images on photographic paper has a 
negative mask to guide the movement of the films. The 

negative mask (18) is provided with a plurality of film guide 
paths (21a,21b) which correspond to widths of the films. A transfer 

unit (25) is provided to move the negative mask in a direction 
perpendicular to the feed direction of the film. Along the 

film feed path toward the negative mask are provided 
sensors (pH) to detect the film size. Printing is carried out 

in such a manner that after the film size has been detected 
by the sensors (pH), the transfer unit (25) is controlled by the 

signal from the sensors to bring one of the film guide 
paths which corresponds to the film size into alignment 

with the exposure axis (X).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic processing
apparatus in which a film is developed and dried, images on
the film are printed on photographic paper, and the
photographic paper is developed.A photographic processing apparatus is know from EP-A-0 136 979 in which
a series of operations including the development and drying
of film, printing on photographic paper and development
thereof are automatically carried out.In such a photographic processing apparatus as
mentioned above, a negative mask having a film guide path
is provided in the exposure unit. The images are printed
on the photographic paper by emitting the light to a film
supported by the negative mask.In such a conventional photographic processing
apparatus, the film guide path has one common size and the
negative mask is fixedly supported in the exposure unit.
Thus, it was possible to process the film of only one size.Printing machines not containing a developing
and drying unit for the negative film nor a print paper
developing unit are known from Patent Abstracts of Japan,
Vol. 009, No. 323 (P-414), December 18, 1985, JP-A-60 149
039 and JP-A-60 149 040. In these documents, negative
masks for holding the developed negative film are shown
which have openings of different sizes for different
sized negative films and guide means for guiding the
negative film across the respective opening. The openings
have to be selected and adjusted manually with respect
to the print gate. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
photographic-processing apparatus which can process films
of different widths.In order to solve the abovesaid problems, in the
present invention, there is provided a photographic
processing apparatus having the features as set out in
claim 1.With this photographic processing apparatus, the
width of the film is detected by the sensors. A film guide
path is selected to the detected film size. The position
of the negative mask is adjusted so that the selected film
guide path will be aligned with the exposure axis. The
printing is carried out by feeding the film thereto.As described above, with this photographic processing
apparatus according to the present invention, a plurality 
of film guide paths each corresponding to the film size are
provided in the negative mask in the exposure unit. The
negative mask is moved according to the width of the film
fed therein until the film guide path corresponding to the
film size is aligned with the exposure axis. Thus, the
films of different sizes can be printed in one
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A photographic processing apparatus comprising a film developing unit (1), a drying unit (2),
an exposure unit (11) to which a film (F) developed and dried is fed, said units being connected

together so that the operations of development, drying and printing of the film frames on a
photographic paper are automatically carried out, and a photographic

paper developing unit, said exposure unit (11) having a negative mask (18) having a film
guide path, said film (F) being fed along said film guide path and illuminated by light to

print images on said film to photographic paper (P), which is fed to said photographic
paper developing unit for development, characterised in that a plurality of said film guide paths (21a,

21b) having different widths are provided in parallel to one another in said negative mask (18) for
a corresponding plurality of possible different

widths of the film (F), a transfer means (25) for transferring said negative mask (18) is
provided for moving the negative mask in a direction perpendicular to said film guide paths so as

to bring one of said film guide paths into alignment with an exposure axis (X) of the exposure unit,
and a plurality of automatic sensors (PH) are provided inside the apparatus along a film feed path toward said negative

mask (18) to detect the width of the film, so that the film guide path corresponding to the width of the film detected
by the sensors can be selected based on

the signal from said sensors (PH) and the film can be aligned with
said exposure axis.
