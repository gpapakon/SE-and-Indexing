<ABSTRACT>
A control mechanism 18 is provided for a turnstile 10 of 
the type comprising a plurality of arms 12 which meet at 

a central hub 14 and are rotatable on a rotational axis 
16. The turnstile 10 is adapted to stop in a position 

with an arm 12 forming a barrier across a passageway and 
is operable to rotate through an arc defined by the 

angle between adjacent arms 12 when the control 
mechanism 18 is actuated to allow a person to pass 

through the passageway. The control mechanism 18 
comprises a first gear wheel 20 adapted to be mounted to 

the turnstile to rotate therewith on the rotational axis 
16 of the turnstile, and second gear wheel 22 adapted to 

be driven by the first gear wheel 20. A drive means 24 
connects the first and second gear wheel 20, 22 together, 

and a release mechanism is adapted to coact with the 
second gear wheel 22 to releasably lock the second gear 

wheel 22 against rotation each time said turnstile 10 
has rotated through the arc. An actuating mechanism is 

adapted to operate the release mechanism. Preferably 
the drive means 24 comprises an endless chain which 

passes around the two gear wheels 20, 22 keeping the two 
gear wheels in registry with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a turnstile control mechanism of the type 
which permits single person access through the turnstile on the actuation 
of a release mechanism but which will bar access to further persons 
passing through the turnstile until the release mechanism is again 
actuated. Most turnstile control mechanisms would operate satisfactorily if they 
were permitted to operate without significant pressure being applied to 
the turnstile arms. However, this is usually not the case and persons 
pressing on the turnstile arms tend to apply a significant load to the 
release mechanism. Damage can be caused to the mechanism, 
particularly when a load is being applied to the arms at the same time 
as the release mechanism is being operated. Most turnstile control mechanisms include a hub fixed to rotate with the 
turnstile arms and some form of release mechanism which is engagable 
with or disengagable from the hub. The diameter of the hub is generally 
significantly less than the diameter of the rotational arc of the outer 
ends of the turnstile arms. Thus, due to the principle of mechanical 
advantage, the load applied to the release mechanism is significantly 
larger than the load applied to the arms by the person pressing against 
the arms. Where the release mechanism comprises a solenoid or like 
electrically operated release catch it will need to be relatively powerful 
to overcome the load applied to it in this manner. If is often found that 
the release mechanism will fail over a period of time.  A further problem with prior art turnstile mechanism is that the rotation 
of the turnstile is not damped in any significant manner. Thus, where 
persons are passing through the turnstile rotate the turnstile arms on 
their way through, the release mechanism is placed under undue strain 
as it clicks into its locked position. This too can result in early failure 
of the control mechanism. According to the invention there is provided a control mechanism for a 
turnstile of a type comprising a plurality of arms which meet at a central 
hub and are rotatable on a rotational axis, the turnstile being adapted 
to stop in a position with an arm forming a barrier across a passageway 
and being operable to rotate through an arc defined by the angle 
between adjacent arms when the control mechanism is actuated to allow 
a person to pass through the passageway, said control mechnanism

second gear wheel (22) is a factor of the number of
