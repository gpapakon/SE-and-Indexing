<CLAIMS>
A test apparatus with a basic unit of at least two
contiguous reagent carriers (30) which have a nominal

dividing line at their joint and which are separable by
tearing along the nominal dividing line, characterised in

that the separated reagent carriers (30) can be releasably
connected to one another by being clipped together, for

which purpose each reagent carrier (30) is provided with at
least one locating projection (38) and a complementary

locating aperture (36).
A test apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the reagent carriers (30) consist of a flat plastics

strip, in which is formed at least one compartment to
accommodate a reagent and, in he same direction, the

locating projection (38).
A test apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the locating aperture (36) is punched

in the plastics strip.
A test apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that if there is only one locating aperture

(36) and locating projection (38), they are provided in an
off-centre, mutually opposite arrangement at the edge of the

plastics strip.
A test apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the locating aperture (36) and the

locating projection (38) are elongate, in particular
elongate oval, and extend preferably in the longitudinal

direction of the plastics strip.
A test apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that retaining webs, are formed on the 

underside (46) of the plastics strip protruding by
approximately the thickness thereof, positioned on either

side of the locating projection (38).
A test apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised in
that the retaining webs are elongate oval wall protrusions

(44) of the locating projection (38).
A test apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the locating projection (38) is in the

shape of a stud projecting from the plastics strip, having a
slight conical widening towards its end remote from the

plastics strip and having a tip or bevel (40) at its end.
A test apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that a multilayer duplicating adhesive

label strip (20) is applied to the reagent carriers (30) and
projects thereover, which has a separable perforated line

(34) at the level of the nominal dividing line at the joint
of adjacent reagent carriers (30).
A test apparatus according to Claim 9, characterised in

that the reagent carrier (30) has a bevel (42) at one corner
and at this location the adhesive label strip (20) projects

thereover.
A test apparatus according to Claim 9 or 10,
characterised in that the adhesive label strip (20) is

attached to the reagent carriers (30) in a tab-like manner
so as to project laterally thereover and is adhered to the

reagent carriers (30) in a narrow edge zone (24) thereof.
A test apparatus according to Claim 11, characterised in
that the adhesive label strip (20) has a notch (32) which

extends over the edge zone (24), which opens towards the
nominal dividing line and from which the separable

perforated line (34) extends.
