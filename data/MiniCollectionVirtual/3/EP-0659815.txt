<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyolefin films suitable
for packaging having specific Elmendorf values in both machine
direction (M.D.) and cross (transverse) direction (T.D.).Said films have been developed to be used in those
packaging fields, the food field in particular, wherein the
packaging must be easy to tear in all directions and the tear
must occur in a given direction. For example, the above
mentioned property is required for ready-to-use food packaging,
such as for sweets, ice creams and milk derivatives, and up to
now was achieved by using paper, cardboard and metallic foils.The films of the present invention enable all of the
previously used materials to be replaced, thus introducing in
the above mentioned packaging field all of the advantages
derived from the superior properties of olefin polymers, such
as high chemical inertia, light weight, inexpensive production
of the films and their inexpensive conversion into packaging,
and above all, the fact that they are easy to recycle. In
particular, the films of the present invention allow one to
replace the multi-layered sheets of paper and metal, which
involve considerable recycling problems.Accordingly, the present invention provides films
essentially made from a composition comprising (percentages by
weight):
A) from 70% to 90%, preferably from 75% to 90%, more
preferably from 75% to 85%, of a polyolefin matrix 
containing not less than 30%, preferably not less than
50%, most preferably not less than 70%, of one or more
crystalline propylene homopolymers and/or copolymers
having a flexural modulus (measured according to ASTM D
790 at 23°C) greater than or equal to 1800 MPa, preferably
greater than or equal to 1900 MPa, most preferably
greater than or equal to 2000 MPa;B) from 10% to 30%, preferably from 10% to 25%, more
preferably from 15% to 25%, of one or more mineral
fillers.Said films possess Elmendorf values (measured according
to ASTM D 1922) lower than 0.8 N, in particular ranging from
0.3 to 0.8 N, preferably from 0.3 to 0.5 N, both in the machine
and cross direction, therefore they tear easily in any
direction. In fact, in order to be able to tear the film easily
the Elmendorf values, which represent the tear strength offered
by the film to the tear propagation, must be relatively low.
In order for the above property to be about equal in any
direction (isotropy), the Elmendorf values in the machine
direction and cross direction must be comprised within a very
narrow interval, thus avoiding the possibility that the tear
