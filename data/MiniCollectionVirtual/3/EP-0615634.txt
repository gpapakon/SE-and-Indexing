<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-developable silver-based 
photosensitive imaging element coated from aqueous 
compositions and to a method for producing a lithographic printing 
plate in a dry manner by means of said imaging element. Lithography is the process of printing from specially prepared 
surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting lithographic 
ink, whereas other areas, when moistened with water, will not accept 
the ink. The areas accepting ink are the printing image areas and 
the ink-rejecting areas are the background areas. In the art of photolithography, a photographic material is made 
image-wise receptive to oily or greasy inks in the photo-exposed 
(negative- working) or in the non-exposed (positive-working) areas 
on a hydrophilic background. Common photographic materials employed 
for making a lithographic printing plate are materials based on a 
photosensitive polymer or are silver salt diffusion transfer 
materials. Silver salt diffusion transfer materials offer the advantage of 
having a high speed in a broad spectral range, whereas common 
photosensitive polymer materials are only sensitive to light of a 
narrow spectral range, commonly between 300 and 500nm. Furthermore, 
photosensitive polymers do not offer the speed of a silver halide 
material. Silver salt diffusion transfer materials require the use of 
liquid processing baths. As a consequence, the formation of a 
lithographic printing plate by means of such materials takes much 
time and requires much labour. The chemicals used in the wet-processing 
are harmful to the human body and they soil the cloths 
and hands of the operators.  
 In GB-P 1,454,271 a method of making a lithographic printing 
plate in a dry manner has been described, which method comprises 
image-wise exposing to actinic radiation the sensitive layer of a 
photosensitive heat-processable photographic material, which layer  
 
contains a binder and, as part of an image-forming system, a light-insensitive 
reducible metal salt of a straight-chain fatty acid 
having at least 10 carbon atoms, heating the layer to develop a 
first image therein by reduction of the metal salt and thereby 
liberate fatty acid, and holding the layer in contact with a 
receiving sheet e.g. a hydrophilic grained anodized aluminium foil, 
whilst being held at a temperature above the melting point of the 
fatty acid so that fatty acid-containing material transfers from the 
developed areas to the receiving sheet to produce an oleophilic 
transfer image. However,
