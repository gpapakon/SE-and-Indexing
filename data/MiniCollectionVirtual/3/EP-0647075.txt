<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for delivering called party identification (shown
on 150 for example) to a called telephone wireless station set (e.g.115) during paging

of the called wireless telephone, or, advantageously, after call set up but before
ringing starts. A control unit then may cause the called line to be displayed, may

cause a distinctive ring to be made, or take other action depending upon its program.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for use in a wireless communications
system, to methods for use in a cellular telephone network, and to wireless
communications devices.With the expansion of wireless communication and the development of
wireless personal communications services, more people are using wireless
communications devices as their primary telephone for both personal and business
use. As such wireless usage expands, it is increasingly important to provide wireless
customers with the same types of features available to line-based home and business
telephone customers. One feature that is not available to wireless users is having
multiple directory numbers terminate to the same telephone.Most businesses, and many homes, have multiple directory numbers
(DNs) that terminate at the telephones in the location. In these systems, each DN is
associated with a line (a pair of wires) that physically come into the premises.
Generally, a line-based system automatically identifies which of the multiple lines is
ringing. In a business, a multibutton keyset shows the user which line is ringing by
lighting a button ("key") associated with the ringing line. In a residential setting,
each line has its own bell that the user can audibly identify. While it is theoretically
possible to have a wireless communications device with several telephone numbers,
it is currently not possible to distinguish which one is ringing.Additionally, business customers frequently use a "call pickup" feature.
Call pickup is simply answering a ringing telephone from another phone. Call
pickup is practical in offices that have several telephones physically located near
each other, so that the ringing telephone can be heard. A person who hears the
ringing phone can enter a code into a second phone and the call is transferred to the
second phone. This is not possible in current wireless systems, as call pickup is not
available. When wireless phones are not physically co-located, there is no means of
alerting a person to the fact that another phone is ringing. Accordingly, a need exists in the art to provide a user of wireless
telephone equipment that has a plurality of DNs a means to identify which DN is being
called, and a need exists to alert multiple phones (that share DNs with other phones) so
that a call can be picked up and inform the users which phone is ringing.EP-A-0526981 discloses a cellular radio telephone having two or more
telephone numbers. The telephone numbers are stored in a memory (e.g., RAM or
EEPROM) in the telephone.

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a wireless telecommunications system, said system
including a switching system and a plurality of cells, said method being for identifying a

called directory number at a wireless communications device when multiple directory
numbers are assigned to said wireless communications device, said wireless

communications device being usable in any of said plurality of cells and movable from
cell to cell while in use, and said method being 
CHARACTERISED BY
 the steps of:

receiving, in said switching system, TCLID signals identifying which one of the
multiple directory numbers assigned to said wireless communications device has been

called;
responsive to receipt of said TCLID signals identifying said one of said multiple
directory numbers, said switching system using said signals to set up a call directly to

said wireless communications device, and also transmitting said TCLID signals directly
to said wireless communications device; and
indicating at said wireless communications device which of said multiple
directory numbers is the called directory number without regard to information

associating said directory numbers with said wireless communications device and stored
in said wireless telecommunications device prior to receipt of said TCLID signals.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step of transmitting includes
sending said TCLID signals with a paging message to said wireless communications

device, in order to locate said device, as part of said setting up of said call.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said wireless telecommunications
system sends a page message to said wireless communications device in order to

establish a call thereto, and said wireless communications device rings in response to a
message from the wireless telecommunications system, said switching system 

transmitting said TCLID signals to said wireless communications device in a message
separate from said page message before said wireless communications device begins

ringing.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step of transmitting includes
generating an audio encoding of said TCLID signals and sending it on an audio channel

to said wireless communications device.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said wireless communications
device includes a display, and said method includes the step of displaying said called

directory number on said display of said wireless communications device.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said wireless communications
device includes an audible signaling device, and said step of indicating includes audibly

signaling differently for each of said multiple directory numbers responsive to said
transmitted data.
A method as claimed in claim 1 including the steps of:

transmitting TCLID information during an existing telephone call to said
wireless communication device; and
generating a call waiting alert at said wireless communications device.
A method as claimed in claim 7 wherein said substep of generating a call
waiting alert includes generating a different call waiting alert corresponding to each of

said plurality of directory numbers responsive to said TCLID signals. 
A method as claimed in claim 7 wherein a second message is sent to said
wireless communication device including an incoming calling line identification

(ICLID) which is decoded and displayed at said wireless communication device.
A wireless communications device having a plurality of directory numbers
assigned to it, said device being for communicating with a wireless communications

system by messages and audio signals, said wireless communications system including
a switching system and a plurality of cells, said wireless communications device being

usable in any of said cells and being 
CHARACTERISED BY

means for receiving from said switching system information relating to a
terminating calling line identification (TCLID) identifying one of said plurality of

directory numbers; and
means for communicating said information to said user without regard to
information associating said directory numbers with said wireless communications

device and stored in said wireless telecommunications device prior to receipt of said

TCLID signals.
A device as claimed in claim 10 wherein said means for receiving said
information includes means for receiving and translating messages from said switching

system.
A device as claimed in claim 10 wherein said information relating to said
TCLID is transmitted via said audio signals from said switching system, and said means

for receiving includes means for receiving said audio signals from said switching
system and translating it into a visual display.

said information includes an audible device that can indicate each of said plurality of

directory numbers by a different sound.
