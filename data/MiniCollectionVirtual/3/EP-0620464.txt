<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lens barrel holding 
apparatus for a projection optical system used in an 
exposing apparatus or the like for the manufacture 
of semiconductive elements. In a projection exposing apparatus for 
manufacturing semiconductive elements, the image of 
the pattern of a mask is projected onto a photosensitive 
substrate (wafer) on a stage through a projection 
optical system. The stage for holding the wafer is 
held on a fixed board (a base portion). The projection optical system includes a 
refracting system, a reflecting system or a catadioptric 
system comprising a combination of the two, and is 
comprised of a plurality of optical elements (a lens, 
a mirror, a concave mirror, etc.). Usually, a lens 
barrel for holding the projection optical system is 
fixed to a lens barrel holding bed, which is coupled 
to the aforementioned base portion so as to be spaced 
apart by a predetermined spacing in the direction of 
the optical axis of the projection optical system. 
The structure of such a projection exposing apparatus 
is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,137,349.  Figures 5A and 5B of the accompanying drawings 
show a prior-art apparatus for fixing the lens barrel 
of a projection optical system to a lens barrel holding 
bed. The lens barrel 40 is provided with a projection 
optical system. Although only one lens L is shown 
in Figure 5A, the lens barrel is actually provided 
with a plurality of lenses. Further, the lens barrel 
40 is formed with a flange portion 44 substantially 
orthogonal to the optical axis 41 of the projection 
optical system and protruding from the substantially 
central portion of the lens barrel 40. Also, the lens barrel holding bed 42 is formed 
with a through hole 45 into which the lens barrel 40 
is loosely inserted. As shown in Figure 5B, the flange portion 44 
of the lens barrel 40 is placed on the supporting 
portion 42a of the lens barrel holding bed 42, and 
the flange portion 44 and the lens barrel holding bed 
42 are fastened by means of bolts 43, whereby the lens 
barrel 40 is mounted on the lens barrel holding bed 
42. In the prior art as described above, usually 
the lens barrel is mounted on the lens barrel holding 
bed while the environmental temperature is controlled 
to a predetermined temperature. However, the lens barrel and the lens barrel 
holding bed are formed of different materials and  
 
therefore, when for example, the environmental 
temperature changes due to the transportation or the 
like of the exposing apparatus,
