<DESCRIPTION>
 EARTH SUPPORT FLUID COMPOSITIONAND METHOD FOR ITS USEThis invention relates to fluids for use in boring and trenching operations in the foundation drilling industry, the subterranean construction industry, and in well drilling. More specifically, this invention relates to earth support fluids, their composition, and techniques for preparing, using, and maintaining them.In creating foundations and shorings for buildings, bridges and other structures and in excavating and subterranean boring for installation of utilities, barrier walls, transit ways and drainage systems, fluids have been used to support the surrounding earth during construction operations. Whenever subterranean construction must be accomplished in granular, unstable, water-saturated or gas-charged soils, it has been customary to fill the boreholes, tunnel faces or excavations temporarily during construction with water-based earth-support fluids, also known as slurries or muds. These slurries have consisted essentially of water, a thickening agent and earth solids from the excavation.The conventional materials for making these slurries are clays such as bentonite and attapulgite. More recently, water-soluble polymers have been introduced and used in place of or in combination with such clays. The most widely used type of water-soluble polymer in these 

applications is a partially-hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) , in the form of a primarily linear, or non- crosslinked, long chain polymer with an anionic charge density of twenty to thirty mole weight. This chemistry is available in both liquid water-in-oil emulsion form and in dry form. Other polymers include dry forms of guar gum, xanthan gum, cellulosic polymers, and blends of these. All of these polymers, including the PHPAs, have been optimized to be completely water soluble and/or homogenizable.These polymers are designed to mix without forming masses or pearls of undissolved or semi-hydrated polymer. It has been customary to prehydrate and maximize solubilization and homogenization of these materials before introduction of the fluid into the excavation or borehole. This has been accomplished through the use of induction systems, recirculation, agitation, and processing of the polymer, and retaining the prepared fluid in a maturation tank for a period of time to maximize solubilization and homogenization of the constituents of the fluid, prior to introduction of the fluid into the excavation or borehole.Clay slurries or muds are formulated with about five to ten percent bentonite in
