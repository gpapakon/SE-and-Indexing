<ABSTRACT>
Distorsion control in a push-pull output stage of a 
speech amplifier of a telephone powered through the 

telephone line is more effectively and advantageously 
implemented by independently sensing an eventual state 

of saturation reached by any of the two output 
transistors (PW
H
,PW
L
) of the amplifier, summing the current 
signals (ε) representative of the sensed state of 

saturation of either or both output transistors, 
integrating (RC) the resulting sum current signal to produce 

a DC signal and using the DC signal for activating an 
AGC loop. The DC signal indiscriminately accounts for 

any cause of saturation, though virtually representing 
the level of the amplified AC signal. 
Distorsion may be controlled without penalizing 
output voltage swing and power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
distortion control system for an amplifier, the 
effectiveness of which is substantially independent 
from variations of the supply voltage, from the load 
level and from the process spread, while not requiring 
any substantial reduction of the output dynamic 
characteristics of the amplifier. The system of the 
invention is particularly though not exclusively useful 
in speech circuts of telephones powered through the 
telephone line. In many known applications such as in line-powered 
telephones containing an amplifier that drives a 
loudspeaker, an automatic control of distortion is 
required, which is commonly implemented by an automatic 
gain control system (AGC). The ability of delivering 
the maximum power to the load, compatibly with the 
supply voltage and current is an attendant important 
requirement of a power amplifier. In telepowered systems, as for example in common 
telephones, the functional circuits of the apparatus 
are powered directly by the telephone (signal carrying) 
line when the handset is lifted from its cradle, thus 
closing a supply switch. In this activation condition, 
a current may therefore flow through the speech 
circuits of the apparatus. In terms of continuous 
current (DC), the speech circuit of a telephone may, in 
a first approximation, be considered similar to a 
resistance connected in series with a battery. On the 
other hand, a telephone line may be considered as a 
series of RC networks, the number of RC cells being a 
function of the lenght of the telephone line. As a  
 
consequence, the DC current that flows through a remote 
telephone is a function of the local substation's 
battery, of the electrical characteristics of the 
telephone line as well as of the speech circuit that is 
powered through the line. This in turn determines a 
certain supply voltage across the speech circuit of the 
apparatus. Commonly, the DC current that is absorbed from the 
telephone line is divided by a dedicated current 
divider circuit in a priority mode in order to ensure 
as far as possible a correct operation and 
functionality of the telephone as a whole. In more 
sophisticated telephones, a part of the current drawn 
from the telephone line may be used for powering an 
amplifier that drives a loudspeaker, for implementing 
so-called "monitor" and "amplified listening" 
functions. The "monitor" function (monitoring of the state of 
the line) becomes operative when the user, without 
unhooking the handset but by pressing a
