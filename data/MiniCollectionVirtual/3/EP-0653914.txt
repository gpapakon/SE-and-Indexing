<ABSTRACT>
Footwear, particularly athletic shoes, that has a sole structure (28) copying the underlying support, stability and cushioning structures of the human foot. Still more particularly, this invention relates to the use of relatively flexible and inelastic fiber (155a, 182) within the material of the shoe sole to provide both flexibility and firmness under load-bearing pressure. It also relates to the use of sipes, particularly those that roughly parallel the foot sole of the wearer in frontal plane cross sections (152, 181), contained within the shoe sole under the load-bearing structures of the wearer's foot to provide the firmness and flexibility to deform to flatten under weight-bearing loads in parallel with the wearer's foot sole. Finally, it relates to providing additional shoe sole width (figures 19-22) to support those areas identified as mandatory to maintaining the naturally firm lateral support of the wearer's foot sole during extreme sideways motion while load-bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the structure of footwear. More specifically,
this invention relates to the structure of athletic shoe soles that copy the underlying
support, stability and cushioning structures of the human foot. Still more particularly,
this invention relates to the use of relatively inelastic and flexible fiber within the
material of the shoe sole to provide both flexibility and firmness under load-bearing
pressure. It also relates to the use of sipes, particularly those that roughly parallel the
foot sole of the wearer in frontal plane cross sections, contained within the shoe sole
under the load-bearing structures of the wearer's foot to provide the firmness and
flexibility to deform to flatten under weight-bearing loads in parallel with the wearer's
foot sole. Finally, it relates to providing additional shoe sole width to support those
areas identified as mandatory to maintaining the naturally firm lateral and medial
support of the wearer's foot sole during extreme sideways motion while load-bearing.GB-A-807,305 discloses a shoe sole which is produced from an unvulcanized
microcellular sponge rubber composition prepared in sheet form without addressing a
problem relating to contoured sides.This application is built upon the applicant's earlier Applications, especially
including PCT publication no. WO 91/10377. That earlier application showed that
natural stability is provided by attaching a completely flexible but relatively inelastic
shoe sole upper directly to the bottom sole, enveloping the sides of the midsole,
instead of attaching it to the top surface of the shoe sole. Doing so puts the flexible
side of the shoe upper under tension in reaction to destabilizing sideways forces on the
shoe causing it to tilt. That tension force is balanced and in equilibrium because the
bottom sole is firmly anchored by body weight, so the destabilizing sideways motion is
neutralized by the tension in the 
flexible sides of the shoe upper. Still more particularly,
this invention relates to support and cushioning which is
provided by shoe sole compartments filled with a pressure-transmitting
medium like liquid, gas, or gel. Unlike
similar existing systems, direct physical contact occurs
between the upper surface and the lower surface of the
compartments, providing firm, stable support. Cushioning
is provided by the transmitting medium progressively
causing tension in the flexible and relatively inelastic
sides of the shoe sole. The compartments providing support
and cushioning are similar in

<CLAIMS>
A shoe sole (28) for a shoe (22), including at least the
following:


an inner sole surface (30) adjacent a wearer's foot (27)
having at least a first concavely rounded portion, as viewed in a

frontal plane, from the wearer's foot (27), and during an
unloaded, upright shoe condition;
an outer sole surface (31) extending from the inner sole
surface (30) defining at least a sole side;
at least a second concavely rounded portion forming the
outer sole surface (31) of the sole side below a first point

located at a first lateral extent (A) of the outer sole surface
(31), as viewed in the frontal plane, from the wearer's foot

(27), and during an unloaded, upright shoe condition;
characterized by
 at least one layer of fiber strands
embedded in said shoe sole (28); and
said fiber layer is relatively flexible and inelastic; and
said fiber layer substantially parallels at least said
second concavely rounded portion of said outer sole surface (31)

of said sole side.
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in claim 1, wherein said
first concavely rounded portion of said inner sole surface (30)

has a naturally contoured shape which conforms to the naturally
curved shape of at least one side of a sole (29) of an unloaded

wearer's foot (27).
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-2,
wherein said fiber layer is embedded in a bottom sole structure (149) of

said sole (28).
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-3,
wherein said fiber layer is embedded in a midsole (147, 148)

of said sole (28). 
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-4,
wherein the second concavely rounded portion extends through a

midpoint (B) of the outer sole surface (31) as viewed in the frontal
plane taken at the heel of a wearer's foot (27).
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-5,
wherein said fiber strands compose an embedded capsule shell

(191) that substantially surrounds a cushioning compartment (161)
containing a pressure-transmitting medium like gas, gel, or

liquid.
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-5,
wherein said fiber strands compose a capsule shell (191) that

substantially directly envelopes a cushioning compartment (161)
containing a pressure-transmitting medium like gas, gel, or

liquid.
The shoe sole (28) as set forth in any one of claims 1-5,
wherein said fiber strands compose a capsule shell (191) that

substantially directly envelopes the surface of an internal
midsole section (188).
