<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vacuum cleaner (floor-type vacuum cleaner, cylinder vacuum cleaner) (43), more particularly nozzle (attachment) or part of same (1), preferably a suction brush device (10) for the care of carpeted floors or hard floors, having a drivable rotating brush (11) and a suction space (15) bounded by skirt means (V), the skirt means (V) being liftable and lowerable relative to the vacuum cleaner (43). In order to improve a vacuum cleaner (43) of the generic type in a manner which is simple in terms of production, especially to the effect that optimal suction power is achieved both on carpets and on hard floors, it is proposed that a movement of the skirt means (V) can be executed independently of a floor clearance of the vacuum cleaner (43).
