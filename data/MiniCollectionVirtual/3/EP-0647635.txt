These compounds are said to have an extremely high
selectivity between paddy rice or crop plants and weeds,
and a strong activity against various weeds. These
compounds are also said to exhibit a very low
phytotoxicity to paddy rice and crop plants.EP-A-0418667 discloses certain carboxylic acid
amides which contain an isoxazole or isothiazole group.
These compounds also exhibit herbicidal activity.US 3991067 discloses certain 1,2,4-oxadiazole
compounds which are substituted at the 3- and 5- positions
by a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic,
araliphatic, aryl or heterocyclic group, or a carbamoyl
group of the formula -CONR1R2 where R1 and R2, which can be
the same or different, are hydrogen atoms or aliphatic,
cycloaliphatic,
