<ABSTRACT>
In a flux apparatus with a tank containing a flux, in order to guarantee reliable flux wetting of the joints of the connection pins (42, 42'; 44, 44') to be soldered with wire ends of the electric coils (40), a spring-mounted suspension of trough-shaped cups (20-1, 20-2) is provided on a bearer (28) of a ladle (18). Compression springs (26) are vertically arranged between each cup (20-1, 20-2) and the bearer (28), the trough-shaped cups (20-1, 20-2) having a predetermined plunge depth (e) which corresponds to the length of the joints to be soldered of the connection pins (42, 42'; 44, 44'). This ensures that, even if relatively large height tolerances of the electric coils (40) occur, in particular at the pin height and/or the coil receptacles, the joints are wetted in a vertically accurate manner. By pressing the cups (20-1 or 20-2) against the, for example, two connection pins (42, 42'; 44, 44') projecting downwards out of the coil body and arranged at a distance from one another, first of all the longer connection pin (42 or 44') is supported against the cup base, the cups (20-1, 20-2) tilting into a sloping position (b1:b2 or b3:b4) until the second connection pin (42' or 44) is likewise supported against the cup base so that both connection pins (42, 42' or 44, 44') are reliably wetted over the same height (pin height).
