<ABSTRACT>
A method of data retrieval reduces the number of Instrumentation 
message flows in a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) device 

(38). The method uses "look-ahead" algorithms whereby data 
items which have not yet been requested by the Agent (36) (but are 

expected to be) are retrieved from Instrumentation (42). The method 
comprises the step of retrieving from the Instrumentation an entire row 

of data from an SNMP table whenever a GetRequest or GetNextRequest 
Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is issued by the Manager (22) to the Agent. 

A SubAgent (40) saves this row in anticipation of a subsequent request 
for another column in this same row thereby eliminating the need for 

further Instrumentation message flows for further data retrieval from 
this row. Whenever a new GetRequest is issued by the Manager, a new 

set of data is retrieved from the Instrumentation. The method further 
comprises the step of retrieving the next subsequent data item in response 

to a GetNextRequest against the last row in a given column 
thereby eliminating the need for a second message exchange at an 

"end of column" condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to network management using the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and, more particularly,
to a method of reducing the number of message flows to and from an
Instrumentation in an SNMP device.Data communication has become a fundamental part of computing.
World-wide networks gather data about such diverse subjects as atmospheric
conditions, crop production, and airline traffic. These networks
evolved as independent entities without the ability, or, until
recently, the need, to interconnect with one another. New technologies,
generically named "internetworking", have emerged making it
possible to interconnect many disparate physical networks and make
them function as a coordinated unit. Using internetworking technologies,
a host, for example, on one network, may traverse multiple networks
and communicate with another host on a different network.The size of an "internet", or group of interconnected networks, can
vary quite significantly. For instance, the resulting network may be
enormously large, such as the nation-wide DARPA (Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency)/NSF (National Science Foundation) Internet
which connects most major research institutions, including universities,
corporate and government labs. Conversely, the network may be
relatively small, comprising only a single corporation's individual local
area networks (LANs).No matter the size of the network, it is clear that the task of effectively
managing the resulting interconnected network is quite important
and has been given a great deal of attention in the networking community.
In managing a network, a network manager must keep track 
of the devices on the networks, monitor the network's performance and
load, and diagnose and correct any problems.While products that manage homogeneous networks have been
available, managing heterogeneous networks is more complex and,
until recently, no generally accepted heterogeneous network management
standard existed. The Simple Network Management Protocol
(SNMP), which originated as a means for managing the TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and Ethernet networks, has
broadened rapidly since its monitoring and control transactions are
completely independent of TCP/IP and Ethernet. SNMP only requires
datagram transport mechanisms to operate.Using SNMP, network administrators can address queries and
commands to network nodes and devices. SNMP monitors network
performance and status; controls operational parameters; and reports,
analyzes and

<CLAIMS>
A method for retreiving data items from a table in a
Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP device by a

manager, said device comprising means (36, 40) including
an agent or an agent and a subagent, and an

instrumentation (42), said instrumentation having at
least one table having a plurality of rows and a

plurality of columns, said at least one table having
plurality of data items in corresponding table locations

defined by said plurality of rows and said plurality of
columns, said method characterized in that it includes

the following steps:

a) said agent (36) receiving a request issued by said
manager for retrieving at least one data item from a

table location defined by one of said rows and at least
one of said columns;
b) said means requesting said instrumentation to
retrieve all of said data items from said table in said

one row;
c) said means receiving from said instrumentation all of
said data items in said one row;
d) said means storing said data items from said one row
in an internal storage area; and
e) said means responding with said at least one data
item from said 
table location defined by said one row
and said at least one column.
The method according to Claim 1 wherein said means (36,
40) are an agent (36).
The method according to Claim 1, in which said means
(36, 40) include an agent (36) and a subagent (40), said 

method being characterized in that:

it includes, between step a and step b the sub-step
of:

   said agent sending a request to said subagent for
retrieving one data item from a table location

defined by said one row and one of said at least
one column;
