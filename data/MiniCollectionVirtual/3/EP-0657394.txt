<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silane compositions, and more particularly, 
to silane compositions comprising a silane coupling agent and a tris(silylorgano)amine 
or alkane. The silane compositions are useful as adhesives, and more particularly, 
as adhesives in the preparation of multi-layer laminates such as printed circuit boards 
(PCBs). Silane compositions and silane coupling agents are well known. The 
use of silane coupling agents can increase the adhesive characteristics of many bonds, 
particularly the bond of thermosetting resins to glass, metal and metal oxide surfaces. 
It is well known that the bond formed by silane coupling agents is often deleteriously 
affected by moisture and, occasionally, the exposure of silane-coupled bonds to humid 
conditions can lead to the premature failure of the bond. To minimize the effect that moisture has on silane-coupled failures, 
cross-linking agents have been combined with the silane coupling agents. For 
example, US-A-4,689,085 describes silane compositions which comprise (I) a 
silane coupling agent; and (II) a disilyl cross-linker compound represented by the 
general formula  
 
(RO)3SiR'Si(OR)3 
wherein RO denotes an alkoxy group containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R' is a 
divalent organic group, and the weight ratio of (I) to (II) is between 1:99 and 99:1 
inclusive. The silane compositions are reported to be useful as primers in the 
production of laminates and other composite materials. US-A-5,073,456 describes multi-layer printed circuit boards and 
processes for preparing multi-layer printed circuit boards utilizing a silane bonding 
mixture consisting essentially of (I) a ureido silane, and (II) a disilyl cross-linking 
agent generally represented by the formula 
(RO)3SiR'Si(OR)3 
wherein each R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms and R' is an 
alkylene group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Unfortunately, the disilyl cross-linking agents described in US-A-4,689,085 
and 
US-A-5,073,456 recently have been found to possess highly toxic properties as 
disclosed in several TSCA 8(e) submissions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(for example, 8EHQ-0388-0347, 8EHQ-0392-1047, etc.). Therefore, the continued use 
of disilyl cross-linking agents must be closely examined. It is the object of the present 
invention to provide materials which can be substituted for the toxic disilyl 
cross-linking agents. This object has been achieved by the surprising finding of silane 
compositions which comprise (A) a silane coupling agent; and
