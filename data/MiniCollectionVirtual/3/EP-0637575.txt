<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymer concrete having improved 
adhesion to substrates. In particular, this invention relates to a 
composition for preparing a polymer concrete in which metal salts of 
α, β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids are utilized to improve 
adhesion of the polymer concrete to substrates. "Polymer concrete", as used herein, is a composite material 
formed by polymerizing a liquid monomer in admixture with an 
aggregate. The polymerized liquid monomer serves as a binder for the 
aggregate. The liquid monomer typically contains one or more 
monomers and polymerization additives, i.e., catalysts. Additionally, 
the liquid monomer may include crosslinking agents, coupling agents, 
initiators, solvents, dissipators, surfactants, accelerators and viscosity 
control compounds. Polymer concrete materials are prepared from 
substantially anhydrous compositions. Polymer concrete materials are to be distinguished from 
polymer-impregnated concrete and polymer-portland cement 
concrete. Polymer-impregnated concrete is a precast portland 
cement concrete subsequently impregnated with a monomer that is 
polymerized in situ. Polymer-portland cement concrete is a premixed 
material in which either a monomer or a polymer is added to a fresh 
concrete mixture in a liquid, powder or dispersed phase and 
subsequently polymerized, if needed, and cured. Polymer concrete compositions, polymer-impregnated 
concrete, and polymer portland cement concrete are reviewed in 
Chemical, Polymer and Fiber Additives for Low Maintenance 
Highways, edited by G.C. Hoff et al. Chemical Technology Review No. 
130, Noyes Data Corporation, Park Ridge, N.J., 1979 and Chemical 
Materials for Constructions, Phillip Maslow, Structures Publishing 
Company, Farmington, Michigan, 1979. Representative patents 
regarding polymer concrete materials are US-A-4,500,679 and US-A-4,460,625. Generally, a composition for preparing a polymer concrete is a 
substantially non-aqueous slurry of an aggregate component, a 
monomer binder component and a polymerization catalyst. These 
components may be packaged separately and mixed on-site to avoid 
premature polymerization. Monomers used as binders include, but are  
 
not limited to, methyl methacrylate and styrene used singly or in 
admixture and, at times, with other monofunctional monomers or 
with polyfunctional monomers such as trimethylolpropane 
trimethacrylate. Polyester-styrene, furan, vinyl ester and epoxy resins 
and oligomers have also been used in preparing polymer
