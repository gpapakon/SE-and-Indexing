<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing high purity chloroaldehyde 
monomers at a high yield by depolymerization of a 

chloroaldehyde cyclic trimer represented by the following 
formula, 


wherein R is a hydrogen atom, methyl group, or an ethyl 
group. The depolymerization reaction can be carried out 

in the presence of activated clay. Said chloroaldehyde 
cyclic trimer can be stored in a stable manner and 

chloroaldehyde monomers obtained by the depolymerization 
can be used as are as a raw material for the synthetic 

reaction of chloroaldehyde derivatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method 
for depolymerization of cyclic trimers of aliphatic 
aldehydes with the chlorinated 2-position (hereinafter 
referred to as chloroaldehyde) which is useful as a raw 
material for synthesis of organic chemicals. Chloroaldehydes having the chlorinated 2-position, 
such as monochloroacetaldehyde (hereinafter referred to 
as MCA) and 2-chloropropionaldehyde (hereinafter referred 
to as CPA), are useful compounds as raw materials for the 
synthesis of drugs, agricultural chemicals, and polymers. 
Because these are extremely unstable compounds, MCA is 
sold as an aqueous solution with a concentration of 
approximately 40% and CPA is not commercially available. 
Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) Nos. 223575/1990 and 
173785/1992 therefore propose to store these 
chloroaldehydes in a stable manner as cyclic trimers and 
obtain MCA or CPA by depolymerizing the trimers upon use. The method disclosed by these Japanese Patent Laid-open 
specifications comprises depolymerizing the chloroaldehyde 
cyclic trimers using a catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic  
 
acid or sulfuric acid at 120-130°C in the 
absence of a solvent. However, the depolymerization of 
these trimers using p-toluenesulfonic acid or sulfuric 
acid as a catalyst in the absence of a solvent involves 
various side reactions of monomers produced, causing 
production of high boiling point components. Because of 
this, it is essential to separate the products by 
distillation after the depolymerization reaction. 
Carbonated residues obtained by the distillation must be 
appropriately treated and washed, which makes it 
difficult for the catalyst to be recycled for reuse. In view of this situation, the present invention has 
an object of providing a method for the depolymerization 
of chloroaldehyde cyclic trimers, such as MCA trimer and 
CPA trimer, in which a distillation is not required to 
remove the catalyst used. This object of the present invention can be achieved 
by a method for the depolymerization of a chloroaldehyde 
cyclic trimer represented by the following formula,  
 
 
wherein R is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, or an ethyl 
group, characterized by carrying out said 
depolymerization reaction in the presence of activated 
clay. In the present invention a chloroaldehyde cyclic 
trimer is depolymerized in the presence of activated clay 
in the absence or presence of a solvent. According to the present invention chloroaldehyde 
monomers which can be used as are for the synthesis of 
chloro
