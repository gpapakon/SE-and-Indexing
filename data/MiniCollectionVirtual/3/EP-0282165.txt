<ABSTRACT>
The power consumed in recovering argon from 
ammonia synthesis purge gas is substantially reduced by 

a process which includes the steps of scrubbing (2) the 
gas to remove ammonia, drying (3) the gas to remove 

water vapour, expanding (5) the gas and introducing the 
expanded gas into a cryogenic separation unit (6) which 

provides a hydrogen rich product stream and a 
substantially pure argon stream. In the preferred 

embodiment, the use of a generator loaded expander (5) 
reduces the power consumed per tonne of argon recovered 

from 1175 kw to 600 kw.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a plant 
for recovering hydrogen and argon from ammonia synthesis 
purge gas. Figure 1 is a simplified flowsheet of our 
previous (unpublished) plant for recovering hydrogen and 
argon from ammonia synthesis purge gas. The feed 1, which comprises (by volume)
 
63.32% hydrogen
 
20.38% nitrogen
 
4.31% argon
 
10.00% methane; and
 
1.99% ammonia
 
at -23°C and 95.0 bar A is first passed through a water 
wash column 2 to remove the ammonia and then a dryer 3 
to remove the water. The feed, now at 12°C, is then 
passed via a dust filter 4 into a cold box 6. A hydrogen 
rich product is recovered from pipe 68, whilst 
substantially pure argon is recovered from pipe 20. A 
nitrogen rich stream is recovered from pipe 70 whilst 
fuel gas is recovered from pipe 69. The power consumed in recovering the argon is 
approximately 1175 kw/tonne argon. The object of at least preferred embodiments 
of the invention is to reduce the power consumed in 
recovering the argon. This is achieved by first removing ammonia and 
water vapour from the feed and then expanding the feed 
through an expander. In the preferred embodiment 
described hereinafter, which utilises a generator loaded 
expander, the power consumed in recovering the argon is 
reduced to approximately 600 kw/tonne argon. According to one aspect of the present  
 
invention, there is provided a method for recovering 
hydrogen and argon from ammonia synthesis purge gas, 
which method comprises the steps of scrubbing said gas 
to remove ammonia, drying said gas to remove water 
vapour and cryogenically separating the dry, ammonia 
free gas to recover a hydrogen rich stream and argon, 
characterized in that the dry, ammonia free gas is work 
expanded prior to being cryogenically separated. Preferably, the gas is expanded in a generator 
loaded expander or a compressor loaded expander. Typically the temperature of the gas 
immediately prior to expansion will be between 0°C and 
40°C, and more preferably between 5°C and 15°C. Advantageously, the gas is expanded from 
between 70 bar A and 250 bar A to between 15 bar A and 
80 bar A. More preferably the gas will be expanded from 
between 70 bar A and 150 bar A to between 20 bar A and 
60 bar A. The method is particularly (but not 
exclusively) advantageous when the cryogenic separation 
is carried out by a method comprising the steps of 
partially condensing the expanded, dry, ammonia free gas 
to provide a liquid fraction and a gaseous hydrogen rich 
product, separating the
