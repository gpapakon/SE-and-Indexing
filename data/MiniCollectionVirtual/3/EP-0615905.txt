<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an air-conditioning system for a passenger aircraft, the conditioning air essentially being supplied by an air-conditioning unit and the passenger cabin being split into three mutually adjacent air-conditioning zones in the cabin longitudinal direction, each zone having a zone sensor and a temperature regulating system being provided for each air-conditioning zone, the invention comprises the cabin being split into introduction sections A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, the number of which is a multiple of the number of air-conditioning zones 2, 3, 4 and the temperature controllers of the individual air distribution systems 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 being connected to a zone control device 41, as a result of which each air distribution system 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is selectively allocated to a specific air-conditioning zone 2, 3, 4. In this case, it is particularly advantageous that a new configuration of the air-conditioning zones can be produced without any installation cost.

<CLAIMS>
Air conditioning system for a passenger aircraft, the 
conditioned air being supplied substantially by means of 

an air conditioning unit and the passenger cabin 
preferably being divided into three air conditioning 

zones (2, 3, 4), which are adjacent to one another in 
cabin longitudinal direction and each have a zone sensor 

for temperature detection, each air conditioning zone 
comprising at least one air distribution system (5, 6, 7, 

8, 9, 10) which is connected on the one hand to the air 
conditioning unit and on the other hand by a controllable 

mixing valve to an air dispensing system, one temperature 
control device per distribution system being provided 

such that the temperature of the air supplied by the 
respective air distribution system (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 

arises as mixed temperature t + delta t from the air of 
the air conditioning unit at a predetermined base 

temperature (t) and the admixture of hot dispensed air, a 
temperature regulating system further being provided for 

each air conditioning zone,
characterized in
 that the cabin is divided into inlet 
portions (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6), each inlet portion 

(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6) having an air distribution 
system (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), the number of inlet portions 

(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6) being a multiple of the air 
conditioning zones (2, 3, 4) and the temperature control 

devices of the individual air distribution systems (5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10) being connected to a zone control device 

(41), as a result of which each air distribution system 
(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) is selectively assigned to a specific 

air conditioning zone (2, 3, 4). 
Air conditioning system according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that a keyboard is provided for entering 
the commands to the zone control device (41) for 

assignment of the air distribution systems (5 - 10).  
 
Air conditioning system according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that a diskette drive is provided for 
entering the commands to the zone control device (41) for 

assignment of the air distribution systems (5 - 10). 
Air conditioning system according to one of claims 1 
to 3,
characterized
 in that the zone control device (41) has an 
interface (48) for entering the assignment commands. 
Air conditioning system according to one of claims 1 
to 4,
characterized
 in that the zone control device (41) is 
connected to a cabin configuration unit (49). 
Air conditioning system according to claim 5,
characterized
 in that the cabin configuration unit (49) 
has an insertion slot for a plug-in module (51). 
Air conditioning system according to claim 6,
characterized
 in that the plug-in module (51) is based on 
an electrically programmable semiconductor memory.
