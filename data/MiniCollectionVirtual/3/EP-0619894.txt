<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the area of
input devices for computer systems, and pertains
in particular to keyboard input devices.All computer systems require user input to
perform dedicated functions. In some cases the
only input needed is a signal to commence
processing according to a preprogrammed list of
instructions, typically called a program.There are dedicated computer systems for
receiving special signals, and for automatically
processing the signals to some purpose, and
storing or displaying a result. An example
would be a computerized environmental monitoring
station. More commonly, however, computer
systems need periodic, and often frequent,
alphanumeric input. An example is in the case
of word processing programs, which accept
"typewritten" information and store the input,
which may be further processed, displayed, or
printed in some desired fashion. Computer
systems, as a result, almost invariably have
keyboards, simulating typewriter keyboards, as
an interface for user input. Keyboards for computers are demanding
projects for electromechanical designers, and
are arguably the most used and abused part of a
computer system. The keyboard, moreover, is a
relatively intricate mechanical system,
typically requiring a number of moving and
interacting parts, and the parts must be capable
of being exercised many thousands of times
without failure.Keyboards, too are subject to a constant
rain of foreign matter, none of which is usually
beneficial to operation. Dust, dirt, moisture,
spilled liquids, skin and fingernail material,
and more, are common intruders to a keyboard. A
good keyboard design has to protect the working
elements from intrusion of foreign matter.Another demanding aspect of keyboard design
is the matter of sensitivity to keystroke. For
example, some users apply considerable pressure
in operating a key, and prefer to use a keyboard
that is insensitive to relatively light touch.
Other users, however, prefer response to very
light touch. There are among users, of course,
all shades of preference between the extremes.
A related characteristic important to users is
the feel of the keys.In the development of relatively small
computer systems, such as desktop computers,
useful for word processing, accounting, and
related tasks, portability has become an
important characteristic. Laptop models. and
even smaller notebook computers, continue to be
developed for users who desire and need to work
with their computers in a variety of places.

<CLAIMS>
A keyboard for a computer, comprising a first contiguous layer
(13) which is flexible and comprises a plurality of flexible keys (21)

formed therein for converting finger motion into keystrokes;

a second contiguous layer (15) proximate said first contiguous
layer (13) comprising a plurality of sensing means for converting said

keystrokes to electrical signals;
electrical conductor means for communicating said electrical
signals away from said sensing means;
joining means for fastening said first and second flexible layers
(13, 15) together; and
communication means for communicating information relative to
said electrical signals away from said keyboard;

   characterised in that
the joining means fastens the first and second layers (13, 15) together

in a manner allowing relative motion between said first and said second
contiguous layers (13, 15) when rolled and in that said keyboard (11)

is rollable into a cylinder of spiral aspect for storage.
A keyboard according to claim 1 characterised in that said
communication means comprises a microprocessor-based keyboard

controller carried within said keyboard and in contact with said
electrical conductor means, and a cable for carrying said coded signals

to an associated computer, said controller serving to create coded
signals based on said electri
cal signals, and said cable serving to
bring power from said computer and carrying said coded signals to said

computer. 
A keyboard according to claim 1 characterised in that each of
said keys comprises:


a molded dome shape (23) in said first contiguous layer (13)
configured to collapse under pressure from a user's finger motion and

to return to its original shape upon release of said finger pressure,
said collapse and return being a single keystroke; and
an electrically conductive area (45) under said dome shape (23).
A keyboard according to claim 3 characterised in that each said
sensing means comprises:


a surface (33) facing said electrically conductive area (45)
under said dome shape;
a first electrically conductive region (35) on said surface (33);
a first electrically conductive trace (41) contacting and leading
away from said first electrically conductive region (35);
a second electrically conductive region (37) on said surface
(33), spaced apart from said first electrical conductive region (35);

and
a second electrically conductive trace (43) contacting and
leading away from said second electrically conductive region (37);
wherein collapse of said dome (23) brings said conductive area
(45) under said dome into contact with said surface (33) establishing

electrical contact between said first trace (41) and said second trace
(43).
A keyboard according to claim 1 characterised in that said
joining means comprises extensions of flexible material from one of

said layers (13, 15) entering and being retained in openings in the
other of said layers to permit said layers to move relative to one

another by stretching said extensions of flexible material during
rolling of the two connected layers into said cylinder of spiral aspect

for storage.
A keyboard according to claim 2 characterised in that each of
said layers (13, 15) define retaining pockets formed as matching

depressions to receive said keyboard controller.
A keyboard according to claim 1 characterised by:

a battery for power, and
wherein said communication means comprises a coil driven by
electrical current supplied by said battery to produce a magnetic

field; and
wherein said keyboard controller converts keystrokes and
keystroke combinations to encoded signals transmitted as changes in

flux in said magnetic field.
A computer system comprising:

CPU means for performing logic and computations;
bus data transmission means connected to said CPU means for
transmitting data;
electronic storage means connected to said bus data transmission
means for storing data and programs; and
a keyboard according to any of claims 1, 2 and 7.
