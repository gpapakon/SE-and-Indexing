<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a drug for human use, having 
contraceptive and mestrual cycle controlling properties, comprising 

N-acetyl-2-bromo-5-metoxytryptamine (2-bromomelatonin) in a 
dose of 25-50 mg per day or N-acetyl-2-iodo-5-methoxytryptamine 

(2-iodomelatonin), in a dose of 20-40 mg per day, in association with 
a progestinic compound. 
The drug is administred for 23 days, by using an association 
of 2-iodomelatonin or 2-bromomelatonin and a progestinic compound, 

followed by 5 days in which only 2-iodomelatonin or 2-bromomelatonin 
is administred; the drug having oconstatic preventive 

and therapeutic proprieties, in mammary tumours and melanomas, 
characterized by the use of 2-iodomelatonin, or 2-bromomelatonin 

respectively with doses of 20-40 mg, 25-50 mg per day; the drug 
having moreover antikinestosic properties, and being characterized 

by the use of 2-iodomelatonin in a dose pro die of 2.5 mg, melatonin, 
in a dose pro die of 10 mg and 2-bromomelatonin in a dose per day 

of 3.5 mg, either individually and/or in association with acetyl coenzime 
A-(AcCoA), in a dose of 8-10 mg per day.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a contraceptive
and menstrual cycle controlling drug
having antikinetosic, oncostatic preventive and
therapeutic properties for treating mammary tumours,
melanomas and a method therefor.After several years of studies and experiments,
related to the mechanism of action of melatonin,
this indole is at present considered
the most important hormonal product of the pineal
gland.The developments in the field of receptor
research have led to the localisation of two important
receptor sites of melatonin in SNC: the
pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, and the
suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus.Intensive studies have discovered the biological
basis for the mechanism of action of melatonin
and its two halogen derivatives (2-bromo
and 2-iodomelatonin).Experiments carried out by several researcher
groups have confirmed some of the previous
discoveries, and have shown that the
ability of melatonin to inhibit reproduction,
under given experimental conditions, can be related 
to a direct action of the indole on the
hormone responsive elements in the SNC and the
pituitary gland.Thus, from prior research it has been
known that melatonin can potentially be used as
human contraceptive drug.In fact, recently performed research has
shown the possibility of using melatonin in association
with a progestinic compound (norethisterone),
as a powerful contraceptive, which,
moreover, provides several advantages such as a
low conception risk (less than 1%), lower risk
of vascular disturbances (no estrogenic compounds
are used) and less painful premenstrual
and menstrual periods as well as a less painful
premenstrual period (melatonin and agonists
thereof are known to have sedative effects).Norethisterone alone, as well as other
progestinic derivatives, have been used as contraceptives
in the recent years, and they are
generally known under the name "minipill".Norethisterone, when used as a "minipill",
however has not provided remarkable results in
preventing undesired pregnancies (conception
risk of about 2.35%). Other progestinic compounds, such as 1-norgestrel,
have been found to provide better
results, with reduced doses (0.08-0.16 mg).On the other hand, it has been found that
melatonin, in order to express its contraceptive
action, required comparatively high doses (100-200
mg).The document WO 88/07370 discloses the use of melatonin as a contraceptive possibly
in combination with a progestagen.The document EP-A-0 513 702 discloses the use of 2-bromomelatonin as a contraceptive.The main
