A screen wiper, especially for a motor vehicle, 
which includes a swinging linkage comprising a first 

element (6) having a U-shaped cross section and a 
second element (8) received in the U of the first 

element, with, interposed between them, an insert piece 
(20) having side walls (22) which are interposed 

between the side walls (12, 16) of the first and second 
elements, the insert piece (20) carrying on its side 

walls annular bushes (32, 34) cooperating with through 
holes (26, 28) provided on the side walls (12, 16) of 

the first and second elements (6, 8), characterised in 
that one of the elements (6) has on each of its side 

walls (12) a through hole (26) which is open through an 
aperture (46) extending to one of the free edges (44) 

of the said wall, and in that the insert piece (20) 
carries a projecting element (42), the shape of which 

corresponds to that of the aperture (46). 
A screen wiper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the intersection between the through hole (26) 

and the aperture (46) has a width smaller than the 
external diameter of the annular bush (32).

Claims, characterised in that the annular bushes (32, 

34) are made of a resiliently deformable material. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the projecting element (42) extends from the 

annular bush (32), to terminate on one of the edges of 
the said insert piece. 
A screen wiper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the width of the 

apertures (46) increases from the through hole (26) to 
the edge (44). 
A screen wiper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the aperture (46) extends 

substantially horizontally. 
A screen wiper according one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the aperture (46) extends
