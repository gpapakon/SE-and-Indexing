<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated laser which is rapidly 
tunable over a wide optical frequency range comprises a frequency 

router formed in a semiconductive wafer defining a tuned cavity. 
A control circuit applies electrical energy to predetermined 

controllably transmissive waveguides connecting the frequency 
routing device with reflective elements defined in the wafer. 

This tunes the laser to a desired one of a plurality of optical 
frequencies. Application of
 such electrical energy creates 
frequency selective pathways through the wafer able to support 

selected lasing frequencies. This laser is economical to 
construct and is useful in high capacity, high speed optical 

communications networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More
particularly, this invention relates to lasers used in optical communications systems.The capacity and speed of communications systems may be 
increased by transmitting information in optical form over
networks composed of optically transmissive nodes, fibers,
waveguides, and the like. High capacity optical communications
systems require that many optical signals be frequency division
multiplexed in the components of an optical network. This
requires that there be a way of conveniently producing
electromagnetic energy at many different frequencies. An ideal
device for producing optical energy useful in an optical
communications system is a laser. Until now, there has been no
convenient approach to creating a large number of optical
frequencies with lasers. The performance of prior lasers have
been limited in terms of tuning speed, frequency selectivity, or
tuning range. All of these prior devices also have been
expensive to implement.J.B.D. Soole and others, in Applied Physics Letters, vol. 61, no. 23, 7th
December 1992, pages 2750-2752, disclose a multistripe array grating integrated
cavity (MAGIC) laser which is essentially a two-dimensional implementation of the
external grating cavity laser in which an array of active elements and a fixed,
etched-in, diffraction grating replace the single active stripe and movable external
diffraction grating of the conventional bulk device. Instead of rotating the grating to
obtain lasing from the single active element at different wavelengths, the different
stripes when separately pumped lase at different wavelengths determined by their
position relative to the etched-in grating.The invention is defined in claim 1.In accordance with this invention, a rapidly tunable
laser has been developed which provides a well-defined set of
frequencies. This laser may be based upon photonic integrated
circuitry which has a wide gain bandwidth. Such tunable lasers
can be realized at a cost lower than that needed to implement
prior lasers used in optical communications systems.In one example of the invention, the inventors
have realized that integrated optical multiplexers and
demultiplexers may be used to create a tunable laser. Examples
of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,002,350 and  
5,136,671. They may be used to create a monolithic laser rapidly
tunable over a wide frequency range. In specific terms, one
example of the invention comprises an NxN frequency routing
device formed on a semiconductive

first and second spaced reflective surfaces (20, 24) formed in said
semiconductor wafer (10), said first and second reflective surfaces defining a laser

cavity, wherein said semiconductor wafer (10) contains doped waveguide sections
which act, depending on the applied bias, as optical amplifiers or gates for transmitting or preventing the flow of optical energy; and

first plurality of waveguides, each comprising a said doped waveguide section, connect the first reflective surface to the frequency routing

device and a second plurality of waveguides, each comprising a said doped waveguide section, connect the second reflective surface to the
frequency routing device such that selective activation of said doped waveguide sections causes one or more

of said waveguides and sections of said routing device to form frequency selective
pathways to provide a lasing route between said two reflective surfaces (20, 24) so that

selected one or more lasing frequencies are supported in the laser cavity thereby
providing tunability of the laser.
