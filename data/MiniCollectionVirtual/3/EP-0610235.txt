<ABSTRACT>
In an information gathering system especially suited to the monitoring of vegetable products in sorting apparatus, a light beam (23) is directed by a scanning source such as a laser (11) at the surface of an object (2) such as a tomato moving in the direction x-x through a scanning zone. The scanning operation is conducted in the y-y direction. Directly reflected light returned from the surface of the object (2) along a path (17) extending from light beam target region (12) is sensed by a line detector (14), which provides an output signal indicative of the level of the directly reflected light. Light entering into the material of the organic product (2) is subjected to a light scattering or diffusing process within the material of the product, so that at least a region (13) of the surface of the product (12) surrounding the target zone (12) of light beam (23) becomes lit-up or illuminated from within. Further photosensitive line detectors (15) and (16) located one to each side of reflected light detector (14) monitor the levels of light emanating from this illuminated zone (13) surrounding light beam target zone (12) and reaching the detectors (15) and (16) along paths referenced (18) and (19) respectively. Comparison of the relative levels of the directly reflected light and emanating light signals enables information to be derived as to surface and sub-surface defects on or in the product (2). The use of suitable logic circuitry enables rejection of defective product in response to the information provided by the light signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionScattered/transmitted light information systemTechnical FieldThis invention relates to systems for revealing information about a material by controlled illumination of the material and the monitoring of diffused or scattered transmitted light from the material. The material may be comprised in a physical object or objects but not necessarily so. The invention also relates to establishing information about the properties of, for example, a fluid or flowable material. In particular, however, the invention is based on scanning an object with a point light source and comparing directly reflected light levels with diffused or scattered transmitted light levels.The invention has a multiplicity of applications. A particular application relates to the detection of defects on individual fruit or vegetable products such as tomatoes for separation out or rejection, and/or to grading the ripeness of such products. A further application of the invention is directed to a sorter for separating extraneous matter from vegetables such as 

 potatoes, in particular at high capacities in excess of 50 tons per hour. The invention may thus be employed in general in the detection of characteristics of organic or living material. The invention may also be applied to the provision of information about the characteristics of inorganic but light-transmitting substances.Background ArtNumerous systems are known for, in particular, classifying articles by optical characteristics, such as their colour. In U.S. Patent Specification No. 2,678,725, a classification system is described in which two light beams of different colours are directed at articles to be classified. The system is arranged to provide dual outputs, one of which is related to the chromaticity of the articles, this being defined as their redness or blueness, and the second output being related to the brightness of the article, namely its lightness or darkness.According to U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,675,769, a mixture of potatoes and stones and soil is conducted beneath a source of visible and invisible light. A detection system responsive to the light reflected by the mixture of materials classifies the material monitored into two categories based upon the ratio of their reflectivities within selected radiant energy bands. Associated sorting means directs useful product into an appropriate collection feature while discarding the unwanted stones and soil.U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,776,381 provides a method for sorting products in which light
