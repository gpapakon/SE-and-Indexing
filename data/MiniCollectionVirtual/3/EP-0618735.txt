<ABSTRACT>
The subscriber device (1) has a housing (4) with a triangular cross-section, on the front surface (7) of which operating and display elements (5, 6) are disposed, and the rear surface (8) of which contains a video camera (10) and a picture reproduction unit (9). A lid (2), comprising two virtually identical parts (2a, 2b) which are connected by a further joint (12) so that they can be swung open, is articulated (11) on the lower rear edge. A mirror (3) which, when the lid (2) is swung open, diverts the radiation axes of the video camera (10) and the picture reproduction unit (9) towards a user located in front of the device, is attached in the outer part (2b). In a different version of the subscriber device (15), the picture reproduction unit (9) is permanently attached above the housing (16). The mirror (3) is in turn attached to a lid (20) which is articulated on the upper edge of the picture reproduction unit (9). The video camera (10), which is aligned with the mirror (3), is installed in the housing (16).

Subscriber videophone device with a casing for
receiving circuit and also operating and display elements,

comprising a video camera, a picture reproduction device
and an adjustable mirror which deflects the beam path of

the video camera to a user, characterized in that the
picture reproduction device (9) close to the user is

mounted so as to be inclined backwards over the casing
(16), and a flap (20) which carries a mirror (3) on its

inner side is linked to its upper edge, and in that the
video camera (10) sits in the casing (16) and is aimed at

the user (B) via the mirror (3).
Subscriber device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, given a distance (a) from the user (B) to the

virtual camera (VK) of 95 cm, the visual contact line (AA)
from the eyes of a user (B) to those of a call partner (P)

on the picture reproduction device (9) is inclined at an
angle (γ) of 15°, the visual line from the eyes of the user

(B) to the virtual camera (VK) is inclined at an angle (β)
of 7° and the optical axis of the virtual camera (VK) is

inclined at an angle (δ) of approximately 3°, respectively,
with respect to the horizontal.
Subscriber device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a further mirror is placed in front of the video

camera (10) to produce a laterally correct picture.
Subscriber device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the picture re
corded by the video camera (10) is
electronically laterally reversed.
Subscriber device according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the video camera (10) can be switched between

mirror and normal picture.
