<ABSTRACT>
The auxiliary switching device, with an electromagnetic undervoltage release and an auxiliary switch with a bridge slider carrying a movable contact cooperating with stationary contacts, uses a two-armed coupling lever for switching in the auxiliary switch and subsequent release of the undervoltage release. One arm of the coupling lever cooperates with the switch slider and the other cooperates with the bias spring (31) acting on the pivot armature (59) of the undervoltage release so that the rotation of the coupling lever about its axis causes closure of the auxiliary switch contacts and the release of the pivot armature.

Auxiliary switching device for an electrical switching device equipped with a
switch latch, especially for circuit-breaking devi
ces and motor protection
switches, including an undervoltage release (1) located in a casing (10a,

10b), and at least one advancing auxiliary switch (2), which can be operated
by means of the switch latch, which contains a bridge slider (12) carrying

movable contacts (4), and fixed connection contacts (5), and which applies
voltage to the undervoltage release (1) prematurely during the switching-on

stage, with the undervoltage release (1) presenting a hinged armature (59)
that is actuated by an electromagnet (56), that can be swivelled subjected to

the tensile force exerted by a tension spring (63) on one side, and that is
maintained under the action of the pressure exerted by a spring energy

storing device (31) in the attracted position in the switched-off condition, while
the hinged armature (59) cooperates with a triggering slider (27), which is

maintained in an ineffective position when attracted and subjected to the
action of the spring energy storing device (31), for the switching of the switch

latch in such a way that, when no required voltage is available for the
undervoltage release, an open-circuit switching operation is carried out at the

switch latch after the triggering of the auxiliary switch (2), 
characterized in
that
 a coupling lever (38) equipped with an axle shaft (380), and two arms
(381, 383), that project radially at places differing from one another, that point

in directions differing from one another, and that are designed differently from
one another, is provided for the switching-on of the advancing auxiliary switch

(2), and for the subsequent triggering of the undervoltage release (1), while
the rotational axis (Z) of the axle shaft (380) of the coupling lever (38) is

arranged running in parallel with regard to the slewing axis (xa) of the hinged
armature (59) in the casing (10a, 10b), and one arm (381) of the coupling 

lever cooperates with a slider (23) that brings about the closing movement of
the advancing auxiliary switch, and the second arm (383) of the coupling lever

cooperates with the spring energy storing device (31), that holds the hinged
armature (59) down, so that, during the rotational movement (D1) of the

coupling lever (38) around its rotational axis (Z), the contacts (4, 5) of the
auxiliary switch (2) are closed and the hinged armature (59) is unblocked.
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a
reversing shaft (25), which extends with its rotational axis (Y) running in

parallel with regard to the attracted hinged armature (59), is supported at the
casing (10a, 10b), rests upon the hinged armature (59) by means of one

projecting lever arm (251), is subjected to the action of the spring energy
storing device (31), and pressed onto the hinged armature, and which is

hinged upon the triggering slider (27) by means of an additional lever arm
(250), in such a way that the reversing shaft (25) can be tumed around its

axis (Y), and that the triggering slider (27) can be moved during the
unblocking of the spring energy storing device (31) and the lifting off of the

hinged armature (59) from the electromagnet.
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in any claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the slider (23), which can be moved back and forth along a straight line
by means of the arm (381) during the rotational movement of the coupling

lever (38), crosses the frame-like bridge slider (12), which carries the movable
contacts and belongs to the auxiliary switch, in a transverse direction with

regard to the closing direction (S2) of the contacts, and that the bridge slider
(12) can be lifted or, correspondingly, lowered as a consequence of the

movement of the slider (23).
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in any claim 1 through 3, 
characterized
in that
 the arm (381) of the coupling lever (38) engages into a slot (232) of
the slider (23) by means of a projecting pin (382). 
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in any claim 1 through 4, 
characterized
in that
 the coupling lever (38) is accessible at its ends (385, 384), which limit
the axle shaft (380) around the rotational axis (Z), through the openings (104,

105) in the casing (10a, 10b).
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in any claim 2 through 5, 
characterized
in that
 a blocking device (36) is provided for the rotation of the reversing shaft
(25) around its rotational axis (Y), which can be unblocked by means of a

radial cam (387) formed at the circumference of the axle shaft (380) of the
coupling lever (38), in such a way that the unblocking of the reversing shaft

(25) is only brought about after the closing of the contacts (4, 5) of the
auxiliary switch (2) during the rotation of the coupling lever (38) around its

rotational axis (Z).
Auxiliary switching device as claimed in any claim 1 through 6, 
characterized
in that

direction downward from the holding plate in order to rest on the lever arm
