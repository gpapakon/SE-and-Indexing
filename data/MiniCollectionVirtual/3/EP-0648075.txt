<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses the use of the antibiotics lincomycin, spectinomycin, pirlimycin, clindamycin, and/or combinations thereof to control, eliminate, and/or prevent the growth of algae. In one embodiment of the invention, a combination of lincomycin and spectinomycin is added at a dose of about 6.6 mg/liter to eradicate green algae. In another embodiment lincomycin is combined with spectinomycin in a 1:4 part ratio to provide a composition of matter suitable for the control of algae.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTROL OF ALGAE WITH ANTIBIOTICS Field of the Invention This invention relates to the use of antibiotics to control algae. More specifically, this invention discloses the use of lincomycin, spectinomycin, pirlimycin, clindamycin. and/or combinations thereof to control, eliminate, and/or prevent the growth of algae.Background of the Invention The control of algae in industrial and commercial water systems, cooling towers, swimming pools, etc., as well as in lakes, ponds, streams, etc. is of importance for economic and aesthetic reasons. It is also desirable to minimize environmental and ecological side effects common to many of the substances which are currently used to control the growth of unwanted algae.Natural and synthetic antibiotics are legion in the art; however, we have found no disclosure of their use as an algicide.Disclosed herein are a series of antibiotics which are surprisingly effective in the control of algae in water systems, aquaria, lakes, ponds, etc. These antibiotics are the natural product of microbiological fermentation, thus they are biodegradable and less likely to cause untoward environmental effects. An additional advantage is that this series of antibiotics has been shown to be nontoxic to all fish and other aquatic fauna tested to date.Information Disclosure US 4,938,958 (Niira, et al) discloses an antibiotic zeolite and its use as an anti-algal in water systems, and when incorporated into paints, adhesives, paper, etc.US 4,613355 (Omura, et al) discloses an antibiotic isolated from Actinomycete, having activity as a herbicide. The patent also discloses the use of this antibiotic against aquatic plants which is broadly defined to include algae. US 4,402,971 (Edwards) describes the isolation of a natural toxin from Scytonema spp. and it use in the treatment of water supplies, swimming pools, etc.US 3,574,697 (Welcher) describes haloalkene bisthiocyanates which are asserted to be useful against Chlorella (green algae).Gauthier, A., et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 214:192-197 (1988) report the mapping of genes conferring chloroplast resistance to erythromycin, spiramycin, and streptomycin in Chlamydomonas.Gleason, F.K. and CA. Baxa, FEMS Microbiology Letters 33: 85-88 (1986) report that cyanobacterin is toxic to cyanobacteria at 5Î¼M and that cyanobacterin is toxic to, or can also be used to inhibit the growth of, photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms. Krajcovic, J., et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 33:1883-1889 (1989) report that the simultaneous treatment of chlora

CLAIMS We claim:
1. A method of controlling the growth of algae comprising exposing the algae to an effective amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of lincomycin, spectinomycin, pirlimycin, clindamycin, or combinations thereof.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the compound is lincomycin.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the compound is spectinomycin.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the compound is pirlimycin.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the compound is clindamycin.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the compound is lincomycin and spectinomycin.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the lincomycin and spectinomycin are combined in a ratio of 1 part lincomycin to 4 parts spectinomycin.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the effective amount is about 0.001 to about 1 gram per liter.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the effective amount is about 0.05 to about 0.1 gram per liter.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein the effective amount is about 0.006 to about 0.01 gram per liter.
1 1. The method of claim 8 for the control of blue-green algae.
12. The method of claim 8 for the control of green algae.
1 . The method of claim 6 wherein the effective amount is about 0.006 to about 0.01 gram per liter. 


14. The method of claim 7 wherein the effective amount is about 0.006 to about 0.01 gram per liter.
15. A composition for the control of algal growth comprising an effective amount of a compound selected from the group consisting of lincomycin, spectinomycin, piriimycin, clindamycin, or combinations thereof, and a formulation agent.
16. A method of controlling the growth of algae comprising exposing the algae to an effective amount of a composition of claim 15.
17. A composition for the control of algal growth comprising an effective amount of lincomycin and spectinomycin combined in a ratio of 1 part lincomycin to 4 parts spectinomycin.
18. A method of controlling the growth of algae comprising exposing the algae to an effective amount of a composition of claim 17.
