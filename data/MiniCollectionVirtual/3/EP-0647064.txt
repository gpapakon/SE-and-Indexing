<ABSTRACT>
An imaging optical system includes an array of 
photodetectors (78), and a focusing system (50) f
or focusing a 
beam of electromagnetic infrared energy on the surface of the 

array (78). The focusing system (50) includes a means (20) for 
periodically defocusing the beam of electromagnetic infrared 

energy on the surface of the array (78). Fixed pattern noise 
associated with the array (78) can be decreased by subtracting the 

array output obtained during defocused reception from the array 
output obtained during focused reception. The means for 

periodically defocusing the beam of energy may be a rotating 
dielectric disc (20) having one half thicker than the other, or, 

in a catadioptic system (Fig. 6), a piezoelectrically dithered 
secondary mirror (212), or a liquid crystal apparatus 120 (Figs. 

7 and 8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of operating an imaging
optical system comprising the steps of:
focusing a beam of infrared energy on an array of
photodetectors and forming an in-focus image comprising an array
of pixels, each pixel represented by a digital word;defocusing the beam of infrared energy on the array of
photodetectors and forming an out-of-focus image comprising an
array of pixels, each pixel represented by a digital word; anddifferencing the digital word of each pixel of the out-of-focus
image with the digital word of a corresponding pixel of the
in-focus image to provide a difference image comprising an array
of pixels, each pixel represented by a digital word indicative of
a limited field of view of the optical system.The invention also relates to an imaging optical system
for carrying out the method. One type of an infrared missile
seeker includes a gimballed focusing system for focusing infrared
energy from an external scene which may include a target, into an
image on a focal plane within the seeker. At the focal plane,
detectors are disposed in an array for detecting infrared energy
impinging thereon. The signals produced by the array of detectors
are treated as indicating the presence and characteristics
including location on the field-of-view of a target as well as
other background objects.Various methods of processing infrared energy to obtain
an indication of a target include the technique disclosed in U.S.

U.S. Patent Nos. 3,872,308, 4,339,959 and 5,072,890 being
assigned to the same assignee as the present invention.An infrared seeker with a detector array disposed at a
focal plane forms an image (i.e. picture) of a scene within
the field of view of the infrared seeker. The image is
formed from a plurality of pixels (i.e. picture elements)
with each pixel corresponding to each detector element of
the detector array. For example, a 128 x 128 element
detector array would provide an image with 128 x 128 pixels
and a 256 x 256 element detector array would provide an
image with 256 x 256 pixels. For images that are to be
further processed by a computer, the image would most likely
be represented by an array of digital words, with each word
indicative of
