<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crystalline loracarbef
hydrochloride C1-C3 alcohol solvates and uses thereof. The β-lactam
antibiotic of the formula (I)

is the potent orally active antibiotic known as loracarbef.
This antibiotic is described, for example, by Hashimoto et al,
in U.S. patent 4,335,211, issued June 15, 1982.The above compounds come in various forms, including the
crystalline monohydrate form, which is disclosed in European
Patent Publication 0,311,366 having a publication date of April
12, 1989. The crystalline dihydrate form of loracarbef is
disclosed in European Patent Publication 0,369,686, having a
publication date of May 23, 1990.
Other known solvate forms of the compound are disclosed in
Eckrich et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,977,257 issued December 11,
1990 and Pfeiffer et al., European Patent Publication No.
0,439,353, having a publication date of July 31, 1991. The
Pfeiffer et al. reference discloses the crystalline
hydrochloride form of loracarbef.Continuous efforts are being made for alternative methods
for isolation, purification and recovery of loracarbef to
increase the possible total yield.This invention provides for crystalline hydrochloride C1-C3
alcohol solvate forms of the compound of formula (I): 

In particular, crystalline hydrochloride ethanol, methanol, and
propanol solvates are disclosed. Also disclosed are processes
for preparing and using the above compounds.The present invention is directed to crystalline
hydrochloride C1-C3 alcohol solvates of the compound of formula
(I):

In the present solvates of formula (I) the C-2' asymmetric
center has the R absolute configuration. Furthermore, the
solvates may encompass the Zwitterionic form of the compound of
formula (I).A preferred embodiment of the invention is the crystalline
hydrochloride ethanol solvate of the compound of formula (I)
exhibiting the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Table 1: 
dI/I119.92-2.09.77100.07.3958.86.1716.35.6540.95.0558.94.8521.24.650.74.4966.44.371.54.2713.24.0010.23.893.13.830.83.6938.43.620.73.5291.03.397.53.357.93.2726.03.20-0.63.1413.93.0912.72.976.42.875.62.826.12.746.22.706.42.6410.12.602.3
The diffraction pattern in Table 1 was obtained with a nickel-filtered
copper radiation (Cu:Ni) of wavelength γ=1.5406Å and
are uncorrected. The interplanar spacings are in the column
marked "d" and are in Angstroms and the relative intensities are
in the column marked "I/I1". Another embodiment of the instant invention is the
crystalline hydrochloride methanol solvate of the compound of
formula (I)
