<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for the bidirectional transmission of data on a two-wire bus system is proposed which operates in single-wire operating mode when there is a large number of line disturbances and, at the same time, prevents power loss even in the event of a short circuit with respect to a high battery voltage.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for bi-directional data transmission in a two wire bus
system in which the transmission lines (CANH, CANL) are connected via

load circuits (R21, R22) and/or transmission stage circuits (R3, R13) in
connected subscriber modules with operating potentials (GND, VCC), with

devices for monitoring the transmission lines (CANL, CANH) for faults
and to switch between operating modes, with means (T1, T11, T25, T26) of

opening the transmission stage and/or load circuits being provided and it
being possible to trigger these means (T1, T11, T25, T26) in accordance

with any faults detected in such a way that when switched to operating
mode a transmission line (CANH and/or CANL) not required for data

transmission is isolated from operating voltages (GND, VCC)
characterised in that

the means of opening each transmission line (CANH, CANL) have a switch
(T11/T26) to earth and a further switch (T1/T25) to the supply voltage

(VCC), in the case of single wire faults the transmission line not required
(CANH and/or CANL) can be isolated from both the earth wire (GND) and

the supply wire (VCC) by opening both appropriate switches (T1 and T26 /
T11 and T 25) and that these same control signals (S1, S11) are used to

control the switch between operating modes and to control the means of
opening the circuits.
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 1 characterised in that the
actuation of the means specified (T1, T11, T25, T16) takes place at the

same time as the switch between operating modes.
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the
switch between operating modes is effected by means of a multiplexer

arrangement (MUX, M). 
An arrangement in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3 characterised
by non-statically saturated transistors as means of opening circuits.
An arrangement in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4 characterised
by decoupling means (50 to 56, 61 to 66) to attenuate faults coupled into

the transmission lines (CANL, CANH).
