<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a submount 
used for mounting a semiconductor laser element on a 
heat sink, particularly a novel submount for semiconductor 
laser element, promising electrical conduction 
between said element and a heat sink. Specifically, the 
present invention provides a submount which has high 
reliability and which can be made in a small size. A submount is placed between a semiconductor 
laser element and a heat sink (a metal block made of 
copper or the like) and has a function of efficiently 
conducting the heat generated in the semiconductor laser 
element, to the heat sink. In one type (A) of conventional submount for 
semiconductor laser element, the insulating substrate 
has an electroconductive layer on each of the two opposing 
surfaces and has no electroconductive layer on the 
sides. A semiconductor laser element is bonded on one 
of the electroconductive layers and a heat sink is 
bonded on the other electroconductive layer, both by 
soldering or the like. Since the substrate per se of 
the submount is an insulating material and has no electrical 
conductivity and moreover the substrate has no 
electroconductive layer on the sides, there is no electrical 
conduction between the two electroconductive 
layers formed on the two opposing surfaces of the substrate. 
When electrical conduction is necessary between 
the two electroconductive layers, the conduction has 
been achieved by arranging a wire, by bonding, between 
the electroconductive layer adjacent to the semiconductor 
laser element and the surface of the heat sink. In other type (B) of conventional submount,  
 
the insulating substrate has an electroconductive layer 
on each of the two opposing surfaces and moreover has an 
electroconductive layer(s) on part or the whole part of 
the sides [this electroconductive layer(s) is (are) 
hereinafter referred to as side metallization layer(s)]. 
A semiconductor laser element is bonded on one of the 
electroconductive layers and a heat sink is bonded on 
the other electroconductive layer, both by soldering or 
the like. When electrical conduction is necessary 
between the two electroconductive layers, the conduction 
has been achieved by the side metallization layer(s). In still other type (C) of conventional 
submount, the insulating substrate has an 
electroconductive layer on each of the two opposing surfaces 
and moreover has therein a throughhole whose inner 
wall has an electroconductive layer (this layer is 
hereinafter referred to as throughhole metallization
