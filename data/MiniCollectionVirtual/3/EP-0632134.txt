<ABSTRACT>
Methods are provided for the replication and amplification of RNA sequences by 
thermoactive DNA polymerases. The reverse transcription reaction is performed in an 

appropriate buffer comprising a metal buffer which buffers the divalent cation concentration 
and which buffer preferably buffers both the pH and the divalent cation concentration. Said 

divalent cation is preferably Mn²⁺. In a preferred embodiment, high temperature reverse 
transcription is coupled to nucleic acid amplification in a one tube, one enzyme procedure 

using a thermostable DNA polymerase. Methods for eliminating carry over contamination of 
amplifications due to prior reverse transcription reactions are also provided. Reagents and 

kits particularly suited for the methods of the present invention are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of molecular biology and provides methods and
reagents which are particularly useful for the replication and amplification of ribonucleic
acid (RNA) sequences. In another aspect, the invention provides methods for sterilizing a
reverse transcription reaction, a homogeneous reverse transcription/amplification reaction
or an amplification reaction contaminated with nucleic acids generated from a previous
reverse transcription reaction. In a further aspect, the invention provides methods for
reverse transcribing a target RNA molecule in a sample.For a description of the related art and the explanation of the term used in the
present patent application it is referred to a related patent application, viz. International
Patent Application, Publication No. WO 91/09944, which provides high temperature
reverse transcription methods.In Abstract C-344, page 181, 94th Meeting, May 23-27, Las Vegas, there is
mentioned an buffer containing Mn2+ for RT-PCR with Thermus thermophilus DNA
polymerase. The document is published after the priority date of the present application.With regard to the present invention it is noted that Taq polymerase has been
reported to inefficiently synthesize cDNA using Mg2+ as the divalent metal ion (Jones and
Foulkes, 1989, Nuc. Acids. Res. 176:8387-8388). Tse and Forget, 1990, Gene 88:293-296;
and Shaffer et al., 1990, Anal. Biochem. 190:292-296, have described methods for
amplifying RNA using Taq polymerase and Mg2+ ion. However, the methods are
inefficient and insensitive. For example, Tse and Forget demonstrate that 4 µg of total
RNA is required to generate sufficient PCR product for ethidium bromide-stained gel
visualization, using an abundantly expressed mRNA target. In addition, false positive
signals from DNA template (PCR product from prior reactions or plasmid DNA
contamination) were not rigorously excluded.The present invention addresses this need and provides improved methods and
reagents, in particular improved buffer systems for high temperature cDNA synthesis by
thermoactive DNA polymerases. The reagents of the present invention are particularly
suitable for a one enzyme, one tube, coupled reverse transcription/amplification assay using
a thermostable DNA polymerase. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for amplifying a target RNA
molecule in a sample, the method comprising the steps of: (a) treating the sample in a
reaction mixture comprising a first and second primer, wherein the first primer is sufficiently
complementary
