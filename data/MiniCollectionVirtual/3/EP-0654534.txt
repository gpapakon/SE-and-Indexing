<ABSTRACT>
An (R)-2-amino-1-phenylethanol derivative shown by 
the general formula (IIa) 


   wherein R¹ and R⁵ represent a hydrogen atom, etc.; 
R², R³ and R⁴ independently represent a halogen atom, 

etc., or a salt thereof, can readily be produced (1) by 
permitting a microorganism belonging to the genus 


Rhodosporidium,
 the genus 
Comamonas
 or the like to act 
on a mixture of corresponding (R)-form and (S)-form to 

asymmetrically utilize, or (2) by permitting a microorganism 
belonging to the genus 
Lodderomyces,
 the genus 

Pilimelia
 or the like to act on a corresponding aminoketone 
derivative to asymmetrically reduce. An 

(R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl) amino]ethanol 

derivative having a high optical purity can easily be 
obtained from the compound of the formula (IIa) or a 

salt thereof. Said derivative is useful as an intermediate 
for producing an anti-obesity agent and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for
producing optically active enantiomers of 2-amino-1-phenylethanol
derivatives which are important
intermediates for synthesis of (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]ethanol
derivatives. The
present invention further relates to processes for
producing the (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]
ethanol derivatives which are useful
as medical compounds or intermediate products thereof.As anti-obesity agents or anti-diabetic agents
belonging to a new category of agents without using
insulin, 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]
ethanol derivatives are noted since the derivatives act
selectively on a β3-receptor in vivo, thus having
extremely low side effects. Pharmacological studies on
the 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]ethanol
derivatives have revealed that the β3-action substantially
depends on (R,R)-form thereof (see J. Med.
Chem., 35, 3081 (1992), and U.S. Patent 5,061,727).
For example, the above-mentioned U.S. Patent discloses 
that an (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylic
acid disodium salt has a higher activity than
the corresponding (S,S)-form by a factor of 47.For the production of an optically active 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]ethanol
derivative,
there is known an optical resolution of a racemic
form or a racemate, or an asymmetric synthesis.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 320153/1993 (JP-A-5-320153) corresponding to the
above mentioned U.S. Patent 5,061,727, U.S. Patent
5,106,867 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
18340/1983 (JP-A-58-18340) disclose a method of producing
an (R,R)-1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]
ethanol derivative which comprises (1) allowing a
racemic phenylethanol derivative to react with a phenylacetone
derivative and a reducing agent such as sodium
cyanoborohydride to produce a mixture of four species
of optical isomers of a 1-phenyl-2-[(2-phenyl-1-alkylethyl)amino]ethanol
derivative, (2) isolating and
removing an (R,S)-isomer and an (S,R)-isomer from the
mixture, and (3) optically resoluting an (R,R)-isomer
and an (S,S)-isomer by a diastereomer method. According
to the method, however, it is necessary to isolate
and purify the only (R,R)-isomer from a mixture of the
four species of optical isomers, therefore, the processes 
are complicated and the yield is decreased.
Further, since large quantities of raw materials are
required, the method is also disadvantageous in economical
facto

A use of a microorganism or a preparation
derived therefrom,

which is capable of acting on a mixture of
enantiomers of a 2-amino-1-phenylethanol compound shown

by the general formula (I)


wherein R

, R
3
, R

 represent, the same
or different, a group selected from the group consisting

of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an optionally
substituted lower alkyl group, a hydroxyl group which

may be protected with a protective group, an optionally 
substituted alkoxy group, an optionally substituted cycloalkyloxy

group, an optionally substituted aralkyloxy
group, an optionally substituted aryloxy group, an

optionally substituted lower alkylthio group, an optionally
substituted acyl group, a carboxyl group which

may be protected with a protective group, an optionally
substituted lower alkoxycarbonyl group, a nitro group

and an optionally substituted amino group, or a salt
thereof, to selectively utilize the (S)-form of said

compound or a salt thereof, for the production of the
(R)-form of said compound or a salt thereof,

wherein said microorganism is a strain of microorganism
as used in Claim 1.
