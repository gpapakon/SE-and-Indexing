<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new class of tricyclic quinoxalinedione 
derivatives which are selective antagonists of glycine binding site of the NMDA 
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. Particularly, the compounds provided by the 
present invention show in vivo antagonism against the excitation of the NMDA 
receptors under systemic administrations and therefore, are especially useful 
for minimizing damage of central nervous system induced by ischemic or 
hypoxic conditions such as stroke, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest, and physical 
trauma, (see, J. McCulloch, Br. J. clin. Pharmacol., 34, 106 (1992)). The 
compounds are also useful in treatment of a number of neurodegenerative 
disorders including epilepsy, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, and 
Alzheimer's disease (reviews: G. Johnson, Annu. Rep. Med. Chem., 24, 41 
(1989) and G. Johson and C. F. Bigge, ibid., 26, 11, (1991)). The present 
compounds may also have analgesic, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antischizophrenic 
activities, by virtue of these NMDA-glycine antagonism, as 
indicated by recent reports, e.g. A. H. Dickenson and E. Aydar, Neuroscience 
Lett., 121, 263 (1991), R. Trullas and P. Skolnick, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 185, 1 
(1990), J. H. Kehne, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 193, 283 (1991), P. H. Hutson, et 
al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 103, 2037 (1991), in which the reagents affecting glycine 
binding site of NMDA receptors have shown such activities. Excessive release 
of glutamic acid and/or glycine from neuronal and glial cells results in 
overexcitation of NMDA receptor-Ca²⁺ channel complexes and successive 
massive amount of Ca²⁺ influx into the cell, which leads to neuronal cell death. 
NMDA-glycine antagonist described in the present invention would obviously 
regulate the amount of Ca²⁺ influx from the glycine modulatory site of NMDA 
receptor-channel complex to maintain normal activities of neuronal cell. 
Therefore, the compounds of the present invention may be potential 
therapeutic agents for any diseases of animals including human caused by 
excessive glutamic acid and/or glycine release in addition to the diseases 
indicated above. Tricyclic quinoxalinediones, 6,7-dihydro-1H, 5H-pyrido[1,2,3,-de]quinoxaline-2,3-diones  
 
and 5,6-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]quinoxaline-2,3-diones 
are disclosed in WO 93/08188, published after the priority date of this 
application, as selective antagonists of glutamate receptors such as NMDA 
receptors and AMPA (2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) 
receptors. The compounds
