<ABSTRACT>
A cutting device for cutting an objection such as a 
citrus fruit includes a cutting assembly (10) and an outer casing 

(12) about the cutting assembly (10). The casing (12) is generally 
cylindrical having a central axis, and has open ends. The 

cutting blade assembly includes a first cutting blade (20) 
extending radially outward from the central axis to a sidewall 

of the casing (12), the first cutting blade (16) cutting the fruit in a 
manner so as to completely sever one portion thereof from 

another. The cutting assembly further includes a second 
cutting blade (22) extending outwardly radially from the central 

axis toward the sidewall of the casing (12), but not reaching the 
sidewall, the second cutting blade (22) cutting the object in a 

manner so as to partially sever one portion of the object from 
another. In use, the fruit is introduced into the cutting 

device at the first open end, is forced over the cutting 
assembly, and exits the cutting device at the second end. The 

invention also describes a scooping device (220) for use on a fruit 
having a generally spherical shape with an outer peel and an 

inner edible portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cutting devices and systems, 
and particularly cutting systems for cutting and segmenting 
fruit. The invention has particular application to fruit 
having a skin, wherein segments of the fruit without the skin 
are required. In the food industry, there is a considerable need for 
prepared fruit dishes comprising, for example, oranges and 
grapefruit, which have been peeled and cut into a number of 
segments. The peeling and segmenting of fruit such as oranges 
and grapefruit is labor intensive in that it requires a 
considerable amount of time to peel an orange, remove the 
undesirable center core, and thereafter segment the remainder 
of the orange. Preparing of an orange and cutting it into 
segments in this way is a multi-step operation, and a 
relatively long period of time is required to peel and cut the 
fruit in this way. It is therefore of benefit and advantage to this 
particular industry to have a device which efficiently 
mechanically removes the skin from fruit, and cuts it into 
segments with minimal loss of the fruit itself, at the same 
time maintaining a high output of the final product. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a cutting device for cutting an object, the device 
comprising a cutting assembly; an outer casing about the 
cutting assembly, the casing having a sidewall, a first end, 
a second end, and a substantially central axis extending 
between the first and second ends, the first and second ends 
being open whereby the object to be cut enters the casing at 
the first end in an uncut condition, passes over the cutting  
 
assembly and exits the casing through the second end; the 
cutting assembly comprising a first cutting member extending 
within the sidewall of the outer casing, the first cutting 
member cutting the object in a manner so as to completely 
sever one portion of the object from another; the cutting 
assembly further comprising a second cutting member extending 
within the sidewall of the casing thereof, the second cutting 
member cutting the object in a manner so as to partially sever 
one portion of the object from another. Preferably, the cutting device includes a coring blade 
for removing a core of the object, and the outer casing is 
generally in the form of an open ended cylinder, the central 
axis comprising the axis of the cylinder, and the coring blade 
is also of generally cylindrical form and coaxial with the 
outer casing, the coring blade having a sharpened upper edge. 
Preferably, the first

<CLAIMS>
A cutting system for peeling and segmenting a 
substantially spherical shaped fruit, the system comprising: 

   a cutting assembly; 
   an outer casing about the cutting assembly, the 

casing having a side wall, a first end, a second end and a 
substantially central axis extending between the first and 

second ends, the first and second ends being open whereby the 
object to be cut enters the casing at the first end in an 

undercut condition, passes over the cutting assembly and exits 
the casing through the second end; 

   the cutting assembly comprising a first cutting 
member extending within the side wall of the outer casing, the 

first cutting member cutting the object in a manner so as to 
completely sever one portion of the object from the other; 

   the cutting assembly further comprising a second 
cutting member extending within the side wall of the casing 

thereof, the second cutting member cutting the object in a 
manner so as to partially sever one portion of the object from 

another; 
   a scooping device comprising a generally 

hemispherical scooping member having a dome or apex and a 
substantially circular edge, the edge forming a cutting blade; 

   a shaft member on the scooping member, the shaft 
member having a longitudinal axis extending outwardly from a 

point on an outer surface of the scooping member near the edge 
thereof to facilitate rotation of the scoop in a direction 

normal to the longitudinal axis. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein the cutting 
assembly further comprises a coring blade for removing a core 

of the fruit. 
A system as claimed in claim 2 wherein the first 
cutting member comprises a pair of blades extending radially 

 
outwardly from the coring blade to the inner surface of the 

casing, one end of each of the pair of blades having its upper 
edge level with an upper edge of the coring blade and other 

end of each of the pair of blades having its upper edge level 
with and contacting the upper edge of the casing. 
A system as claimed in claim 3 wherein the second 
cutting member comprises at least one blade extending radially 

outwardly from the coring blade, one end of said blade having 
an upper edge level with the upper edge of the coring blade, 

the other end of said blade having an upper edge which extends 
downwardly away from the upper edge of the outer casing, the 

blade having its other end a predetermined distance from the 
inner surface of the casing. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 further comprising 
a base member of hemispherical shape, the base member being 

adapted to accommodate and hold a piece of fruit the inside 
of which is removed by the scooping member. 
A system as claimed in claim 5 wherein the inner 
surface of the base member has a plurality of projections 

thereon for engaging the peel of the fruit to prevent slippage 
thereof while contained in the base member.
