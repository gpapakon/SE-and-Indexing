A meal-taking device, comprising handle means (10) and 
receptacle-forming means (12) for receiving foods, said handle means (10) 

including a first end (16) for connecting to the receptacle-forming means 
and a second end (18) that is free, the distance between the two ends being 

sufficient to enable the handle means to be grasped in the hand, said 
handle means (10) taking up a position that is substantially central with 

respect to the receptacle-forming means (12) and being in the form of a 
hollow truncated cone forming a housing that is open at its top end and that 

is suitable for receiving beaker-forming means, the device being 
characterised in that the receptacle-forming means (12) have a bottom and 

a side wall (20), said bottom being connected to said first end of the handle 
means (16), a portion of said bottom being substantially in the same plane 

as the second end of the handle means, the portion of said bottom that 
connects to the handle means (10) leaving empty space (26) around the 

handle means (10) to allow the hand of the user to be engaged around the 
handle means and comprising a projecting portion (40) extending the side 

wall to the space that surrounds the handle means in order to pass the wrist 
of the user. 
The meal-taking device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said handle means (10) is in the form of a hollow truncated cone 

forming an internal housing, said connecting first end (16) having a diameter 
greater than the diameter of said second end (18). 
The meal-taking device according to any one of claims 1 and 
2, characterised in that the receptacle-forming means (12) is substantially 

circularly symmetrical about an axis (X) passing substantially through the 
center of the first end of the handle means (10). 
The meal-taking device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the section of the receptacle-forming means (12) on an axial half-plane 

is flared in shape with an apex forming the bottom of the receptacle, 
with one of its branches forming the side wall, and with the second branch 

forming the connecting portion for connecting to the handle means. 
The meal-taking device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the receptacle-forming means (12) further comprise  

 
partition elements extending from the first end of the handle means to said 

side wall. 
The meal-taking device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it further comprises individual receptacles (64) suitable 

for being disposed in the receptacle-forming means (12). 
The meal-taking device according to claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that said internal housing is open at its first end, in that said 

receptacle-forming means (12) have an opening (52) that extends 
substantially radially relative to said axis, and in that the side wall of the 

handle means (10) has a slot (50) extending between the two ends thereof 
and in register with said opening, thereby enabling the stem of a stemmed 

glass to be engaged in the inside housing of the handle means. 
The meal-taking device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the second end of the handle means (18) is closed by a partition, and in 

that said partition is provided with a slot (56) extending the slot (50) formed 
in the side wall of the handle means to the center of said second end. 
The meal-taking device according to any one of claims 1 and 
2, characterised in that the wall forming the bottom of the receptacle-forming 

means (12) includes projecting portions extending from the side 
wall to the connecting portion, whereby the receptacle-forming means 

comprise a plurality of distinct compartments. 
The meal-taking device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that said receptacle-forming means (12) comprise a plurality of individual 

receptacles (92, 94, 96) that are removable relative to the handle means 
(10), each individual receptacle (92, 94, 96) comprising a bottom, a side 

wall, and means (102) for securing it to said first end (100) of the handle 
means, said bottoms of the individual receptacles being disposed 

substantially in the same plane as the second end of the handle means 
when said receptacles are secured to said handle means.
