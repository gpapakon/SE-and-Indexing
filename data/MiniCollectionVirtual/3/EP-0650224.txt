<ABSTRACT>
An electrical contact (11) adapted for plugging connection, 
comprising a pair of contact spring arms (25) for 

pluggably receiving a tab contact. The contact (11) has 
arranged on its outside an outer back-up spring (13) 

including a pair of outer back-up spring arms cooperating 
the the contact spring arms (25). The outer back-up spring 

(13) can be slid onto the outside of the contact (11) from

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical contact
adapted for plugging connection, comprising at least one
pair of contact spring arms for pluggably receiving a tab
contact, the contact having arranged on its outside an
outer back-up spring including at least one pair of outer
back-up spring arms cooperating with the contact spring
arms.A contact of this type is known from
DE-A- 32 48 978. This contact comprises a box-shaped
contact body, and the outer back-up spring also has
a box-shaped outer back-up spring body fitting onto the
contact body. Locking of the outer back-up spring on the
contact is effected in that, after sliding of the outer
back-up spring onto the contact, predetermined portions of
the outer back-up spring body are bent into recesses and
behind transverse edges of the contact body, respectively.
It is also known to bend locking lances projecting fron
the outer back-up spring about corresponding sidewalls of
the contact and to clamp them there after placement of the
outer back-up spring onto the contact. GB-A-2 220 310 discloses an electrical contact having a back-up spring
which includes an upper plate comprising an end flap which extends
from a rear edge of the plate and is bent downwardly to provide a rear
plate for abutment with a sliding plate retaining member when the
contact is in a connector housing. The plate retaining member is slidable
between a locking position in which it effects secondary locking of the
contact within the connector housing, and a non-locking position in
which the contact is free to be moved into the housing.It is the object of the invention to provide an improved contact with
outer back-up spring receivable in a connector housing with secondary
locking means.This object is met with a contact according to claim 1 of the European
patent designating PT.A different set of claims has been filed for the European patent
designating DE, ES, FR, GB, IT and NL in view of EP-A-0 492 086
forming prior art pursuant to Art. 54(3)(4) EPC. Further developments of the contact according to the
invention are indicated in the dependent claims.The invention and further features and advantages
thereof will now be elucidated in more detail by way of an 
embodiment with reference to the drawings in which
Fig. 1 shows a perspective side view of a contact
according to the invention;Fig. 2 shows a bottom plan view of a contact substantially
identical with that of Fig. 1;Fig. 3 shows a side plan view of the back-up spring;Fig. 4 shows a longitudinal side view of this contact;
