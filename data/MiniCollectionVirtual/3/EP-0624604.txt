<ABSTRACT>
Amorphous copolymers of ethylene with α-olefins and 
optionally minor amounts of polyenes are disclosed, having the 

following characteristics: 

(A) the % by mole content of α-olefin in the copolymer (%α) 
and the ratio between the molar amount of α-olefin diads 

and the molar content of α-olefin in the copolymer (αα/α) 
satisfy the following relationship:



(%α) - 250 (αα/α) ≧ 10 
(B) less than 2% of the CH₂ groups in the polymeric chain are 
in sequences (CH₂)
n
, wherein n is an even number. 
These copolymers are obtainable by operating in the presence 
of particular metallocene-based catalysts having two 

fluorenyl groups joined together through a bridging group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copolymers of ethylene
with α-olefins and to the process for their preparation. More
particularly, the present invention relates to substantially
amorphous copolymers of ethylene with one or more α-olefins
containing 4 or more carbon atoms, and optionally with a minor
amount of polyenes.Copolymers of ethylene with one or more α-olefins and
optionally a minor amount of polyenes are known which, after
vulcanisation, exhibit elastomeric type properties. The most
common of these are copolymers of ethylene with propylene
(EPR), which can contain small amounts of non-conjugated diene
monomers (EPDM).Thanks to their good resistance to high temperatures,
chemical and atmospheric agents, and their dielectric properties,
these elastomers find uses in various application
fields. Principally they can be used as additives for lubricating
oils, covering materials in building, electric insulators,
components in the automotive industry or modifiers in
mixtures with thermoplastic polymers.Elastomeric copolymers of ethylene with α-olefins different
from propylene, at the date of the present invention, do
not have interesting industrial applications.The above mentioned ethylene copolymers are generally
prepared in the presence of Ziegler-Natta catalysts.Natta et al, for example, in "La Chimica e l'Industria, 
41, 769 (1959)", describe copolymerization reactions of
ethylene with 1-butene in the presence of vanadium halides and
trialkyl aluminium compounds.The copolymers so obtained have a high tendency to produce
blocks of α-olefin comonomers in the chain, and this
gives rise to crystallinity negatively influencing the final
characteristic of the product. Therefore, in order to obtain
vulcanised copolymers which are endowed with good elastomeric
properties, it is important that the distribution of the
monomeric units within the chain is as homogenous as possible.
Zambelli et al., in "Makromol. Chem., 115, 73 (1968)"
describe the preparation of copolymers of ethylene and 1-butene
in the presence of a catalytic system comprising VCl4,
AlEt2Cl and anisole. The copolymers obtained have a tendency
to an alternating distribution of the comonomer.More recently, ethylene copolymers of this type have been
prepared in the presence of homogeneous catalysts obtained
from metallocenes and aluminoxane compounds.U.S. Patent No. 5,001,205, for example, describes a process
for the preparation of elastomeric copolymers of ethylene
with α-olefins, in which the product obtained from the reaction
