<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use of catoites of the formula (I): Ca3Al2(OH)12, as stabilizers for polymers made from chlorine-containing olefins, a method of stabilizing such polymers and a stabilizer mixture containing zinc soaps, calcium soaps and/or calcium complexes of 1,3-diketones and catoites of the formula (I).

 (I) for 
stabilizing polymers based on chlorine-containing olefins, characterized in 

that the katoites of formula (I), which are optionally surface-modified, are 
used in stabilizer mixtures containing the following components (based on 

100 parts by weight of polymer): 

0.1 to 10 parts by weight of katoite, 
0.2 to 4 parts by weight of zinc soap of C
8-22
 fatty acids and 
0.1 to 1 part by weight of calcium soap of C
8-22
 fatty acids and/or 0.1 
to 4 parts by weight of calcium complexes of 1,3-diketones. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) have an average particle diameter of 0.1 to 100 Âµm. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) are used in quantities of 1 to 5 parts by weight to 100 parts by 

weight of polymer. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) are surface-modified with one or more additives selected from the 

groups 

a) optionally alkoxylated alcohols containing one or more hydroxyl 
groups, 
b) partly or completely epoxidized unsaturated fatty acids, fatty alcohols 
and/or derivatives thereof, 
c) full and partial esters of polyols containing 3 to 30 carbon atoms and 
2 to 6 hydroxyl groups with carboxylic acids containing 6 to 22 carbon 

atoms, 
d) alkyl and aryl phosphites, 
e) homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, 
f) lignin and naphthalenesulfonates and/or trimer fatty acids, 
g) salts of fatty acids. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) are modified with polyols containing at least one hydroxyl group 

or one ether oxygen for every 3 carbon atoms, preferably modified with 
glycerol and/or technical oligoglycerol mixtures with average degrees of 

condensation of 2 to 10. 
The use claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) are modified with homopolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic 

acid and copolymers thereof with styrene, acrolein, alkyl styrenes containing 
1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, styrenesulfonic acid, maleic acid, 

maleic anhydride and a salt of maleic acid. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the katoites of 
formula (I) are used in the form of a mixture with calcium and/or aluminium 

hydroxide in quantities below 50% by weight, based on katoite. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
the stabilizer mixtures are used to stabilize polyvinyl chloride.

olefins, characterized in that, before thermoforming, the polymers are mixed 

with the stabilizer mixtures to be used in accordance with one or more of 
claims 1 to 7.
