<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pyrazole-glycolic 
acid amide derivatives and to herbicides 
containing them as the active ingredients. At present, a lot of herbicides have been put to 
practical use as those applicable to paddy fields, and 
they are popularly used as single products or combination 
products. Herbicides may be applied to various kinds of 
paddy weeds. A lot of herbicides effective against annual 
broad-leaved weeds are known, and herbicides effective 
against perennial weeds are increasing in these several 
years. However, since Echinochloa crus-galli, which is one 
serious paddy weed and which grows mostly in large areas 
of paddy fields, belongs to the same family of Gramineae 
as a paddy rice plant belongs to, herbicides which are 
effective against only, Echinochloa crus-galli, 
especially those that have grown tall, without injuring 
paddy rice plants at all are not almost known.  As the prior art relating to compounds which are 
similar to the compounds of the present invention with 
respect to their chemical structures, compounds having a 
glycolic acid amide moiety bonded to the 2-position of a 
benzothiazole ring have been disclosed in JP-A 54-154762, 
compounds having the same moiety bonded to a 5-membered 
aromatic mono-cyclic ring containing an oxygen atom or a 
sulfur atom along with from 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms have 
been disclosed in JP-A 55-147267, compounds having the 
same moiety bonded to-the 5-position of a tetrazole ring 
have been disclosed in JP-A 56-86175, and compounds having 
the same moiety bonded to the 5-position of an isoxazole 
ring have been disclosed in JP-A 63-152367. However, 
compounds having a glycolic acid amide moiety bonded to a 
pyrazole ring, such as those of the present invention, are 
not known at all up to the present and are novel 
compounds. We, the present inventors have continued assiduous 
studies for many years so as to develop herbicides that 
are selectively effective against only harmful weeds 
without injuring important crop plants, while having 
investigated a lot of compounds with respect to their 
herbicidal activity so as to create herbicidal compounds 
which have a higher herbicidal activity and a broader  
 
selectivity in the activity. As a result, we have found 
that pyrazole-glycolic acid amide derivatives of the 
following formula (1) (hereinafter referred to as 
compounds of the present invention) have a high herbicidal 
activity against Echinochloa crus-galli and other paddy 
weeds, while having a high safety for
