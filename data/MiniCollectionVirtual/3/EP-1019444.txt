<DESCRIPTION>
 Glyoxylic compound comprising one or more active ingredientField of the inventionThe present invention relates to glyoxylic compounds comprising one or more active ingredient, in particular alcohol or mixed alcohol/aldehyde ingredients. More particularly, it relates to glyoxylic compound comprising one or more active ingredient for use in laundry and cleaning products.Background of the inventionCleaning and laundry products are well-known in the art. However, consumer acceptance of laundry and cleaning products is determined not only by the performance achieved with these products but also the aesthetics associated therewith. The perfume components are therefore an important aspect of the successful. formulation of such commercial products.It is also desired by consumers for laundered fabrics to maintain the pleasing fragrance over time. Indeed, perfume additives make laundry compositions more aesthetically pleasing to the consumer, and in some cases the perfume imparts a pleasant fragrance to fabrics treated therewith. However, the amount of perfume 

carry-over from an aqueous laundry bath onto fabrics is often marginal and does not last long on the fabric. Furthermore, fragrance materials are often very costly and their inefficient use in laundry and cleaning compositions and ineffective delivery to fabrics result in a very high cost to both consumers and laundry and cleaning manufacturers. Industry, therefore, continues to seek with urgency for more efficient and effective fragrance delivery in laundry and cleaning products, especially for improvement in the provision of long-lasting fragrance to the fabrics.One solution is to use carrier mechanisms for perfume delivery, such as by encapsulation. This is taught in the prior art and described in U.S. 5,188,753. Still another solution is to formulate compounds which provide a delayed release of the perfume over a longer period of time than by the use of the perfume itself have been provided. Disclosure of such compounds may be found in WO 95/04809, WO 95/08976 and pending application EP 95303762.9.However, notwithstanding the advances in the art, there is still a need for a compound which provides a delayed release of the perfume component.The Applicant has now found that glyoxylic compounds comprising one or more active alcohols also provide a delayed release of the active such as a perfume.Another advantage of the invention is that these glyoxylic compound can suitably be copolymerised with a monomeric unit, of which an active aldehydic monomeric
