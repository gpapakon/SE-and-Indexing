<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coating composition, to a process for the colouring of shaped articles with the coating composition, and to the coated shaped articles, especially shaped articles (mouldings) of thermoplastic or thermoelastic plastics, with a primarily optically clear, scratchproof and weather-resistant coating in the form of a hardened thin layer which is formed on the plastic material by polymerisation of a monomeric coat of the coating composition which essentially comprises polyfunctional acrylic and/or methacrylic compounds and which contains, in accordance with the invention, fluoroalkyl (meth)acrylates of the formula I

 in which R1 is H or CH3 and R2 is a fluorine-containing C2- to C20-alkyl radical, as levelling agents, and which are essential in order to achieve a good optical quality of the hardened coating.

A coating agent for provision of a scratch-resistant
and weatherproof coating, with good

optical qualities, on a moulded plastic body by
means of application of a varnish coating with

radically-polymerisable crosslinking monomers
and/or oligomers with at least two polymerisable

carbon double bonds mixed with further monomers
which contain a polymerisable double bond and the

usual additives, and hardening of the varnish by
means of polymerisation, characterised in that the

coating agent, as an eluent, contains fluoralkyl
group-containing (meth)acryl monomers of formula



where R

, where a = 2 to 20, b =
0 to 4, c = 2a + 1-b;

in quantities of 2 to 40% by weight, based on the
total weight of the polymerisable components

present in the coating agent, and at least 30% by

weight based on the monomers which are to be
polymerised, or oligomers of a monomer, or

oligomers with at least three carbon double bonds. 
A coating agent according to claim 1, characterised
in that based on the monomers and/or oligomers

which are to be polymerised, this contains at least
30% by weight of a monomer or oligomer with at

least three carbon double bonds and 5 to 20% by
weight of a fluoroalkyl group-containing

(meth)acryl monomer of formula I.
A coating agent according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that at least 70% by weight of

monomers with acrylate units are used as monomers
with at least two carbon double bonds.
A coating agent according to claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it contains UV protection

agents, especially those which can be polymerised
therein.
A process for coating moulded bodies with coating
agents according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the moulded bodies are
plastics.
A process according to claim 5, characterised in
that the moulded body comprises

polymethylmethacrylate or a mixture of polymers
comprised of at least 60% by weight

methylmethacrylate or a polycarbonate.
A process according to claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that a moulded body formed by

extrusion is coated.
A process according to claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that injection-moulded parts are

coated. 
Moulded bodies of thermoplastic or thermoelastic
plastic with a scratch-resistant and weatherproof

coating, produced by means of a coating agent
according to claims 1 to 4 and according to claims

5 to 8.
