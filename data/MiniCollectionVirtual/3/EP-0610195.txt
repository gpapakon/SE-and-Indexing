<ABSTRACT>
Triggering (T) is initiated at a preset difference (Z) in the voltage level after the maximum amplitude of the trigger pulse, whereby a displacement in the trigger point is brought about as the speed of rotation increases. As the amplitude of the trigger pulse reaches a preset level (N) as the speed of rotation increases further, triggering occurs instead only once this preset level is passed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling 
the trigger sequence in a flywheel magneto system, which 
system includes a magnet system for inducing a trigger 
pulse for a gate trigger current switch. Previously disclosed within the area of ignition circuit 
design is the arrangement in the primary ignition coil 
circuit of magneto ignition systems containing an ignition 
transformer of a gate trigger current switch, for example 
a thyristor or a transistor, which is caused to conduct at 
a specific ignition time, resulting in the induction of an 
ignition voltage in the secondary winding of the coil. A 
control circuit of this kind, possibly containing a special 
trigger coil, is connected between the generator circuit 
and the control input to the gate trigger current switch. 
Such systems are previously disclosed, for example, through 
SE-B-357 032, SE-B-455 216, and SE-B-457 373. These 
previously disclosed systems are more or less complicated 
and contain sensing devices to control the release of the 
trigger at an appropriate ignition time. A flywheel magneto system of the kind mentioned above, in 
which the method in accordance with the invention can be 
applied, comprises, for example, a flywheel with a magnet 
unit installed in the wheel, in which two or more magnetic 
poles lie on an outer or inner periphery. Arranged directly 
adjacent to that periphery is a low-retentivity unit 
consisting of one or more essentially radially oriented  
 
legs. Coils are then arranged around one or more of these 
legs for the purpose of receiving energy from the passing 
magnetic poles. One common method of executing such a unit 
is to install all the coils belonging to the ignition 
system and the other electrical components in such a way 
that only a single core leg carries the necessary coils. 
Because capacitor ignition systems are concerned 
specifically, it is customary to utilize the most energy-rich 
partial wave in the induced voltage for charging the 
ignition capacitor. The following partial wave is used in 
order to initiate the ignition sequence. This permits 
simple and inexpensive solutions, which make effective use 
of the available energy. Nevertheless, the partial wave 
used to start the ignition sequence, "triggering", is too 
narrow to provide an acceptable advance of the trigger 
point as the speed of rotation increases, which is 
desirable. The form of the pulse is also influenced by the 
delay caused by charging of the ignition capacitor. One 
method of avoiding this

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the trigger sequence in a 
flywheel magneto system including a magnet system for 

inducing a trigger pulse for a gate trigger current switch, 

characterized
 in that triggering is initiated at a specific 
difference in voltage level after the highest value of the 

trigger pulse, whereby, as the increasing speed of rotation 
causes an increasing amplitude in the trigger pulse, a 

displacement is achieved in the trigger point T involving 
an advance in the ignition sequence. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that, 
for a further increase in the speed of rotation, from the 

point at which the amplitude of the trigger pulse reaches 
a preset level N, triggering is initiated only when the 

trigger pulse passes the aforementioned preset level N, 
resulting in a further displacement of the trigger point T. 
Method according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in 
that, in order to eliminate triggering interference, an 

arrangement (8), which requires a specific voltage level to 
be reached in order to permit current to pass, is connected 

in series with the gate trigger current switch (9).
