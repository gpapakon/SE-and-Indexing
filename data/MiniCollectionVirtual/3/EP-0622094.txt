<ABSTRACT>
A golf iron head has a main body and, securely 
attached to at least part of the front face of the 

main body, a face insert (5) having a flexural modulus 
in the range 1 to 20 GPa, especially a face insert 

of a thermoplastic composite of nylon reinforced with 
glass fibre. There is also provided a golf iron head 

wherein the face insert is located in a correspondingly 
shaped recess in the front face of the main body and 

is mechanically interlocked with the recess by 
peripheral mating flange and groove formations, 

especially partial dovetail shaped formations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the head structure of golf 
clubs. In co-pending International Patent Application No. 
PCT/GB92/01765 there are described golf iron heads in which 
at least part of the ball-striking face of the head 
comprises at least one face-piece component selected for 
one or more characteristics such as surface friction, 
hardness, flexural modulus, resilience, specific gravity, 
weight and geometric configuration, in order to confer play 
characteristics such as to improve performance of balls 
struck by the head and/or to improve weight distribution in 
the head. Various shapes and materials for the face-piece 
component and various means of securing the component to 
the head main body are described. It is found that, suitably, the face-piece component 
(hereinafter called 'face insert' or 'insert') has a 
flexural modulus in the range 1 to 20, preferably 2 to 10, 
GPa as measured at 23°C. Suitably also the face insert has 
a Rockwell M hardness in the range 70 to 130, preferably 95 
to 115. It is found also that one of the face insert materials 
referred to in the aforementioned co-pending Application is 
especially suitable, namely a thermoplastic composite of 
nylon, preferably reinforced by glass fibre. Suitable 
nylons, which may or may not be impact-modified, include 
Nylons 6, 6.6, 6.10 and 11. Examples of suitable ratios of 
glass:nylon are up to about 60:40 by weight. The glass 
fibre suitably is in the form of short fine fibres, such as 
of length in the range of about 0.2 to 3 mm. If desired, 
the composite may contain pigment, for example carbon 
black. Examples of suitable face insert materials are the 
glass fibre reinforced nylons available under the trade 
names 'Zytel 80G43' and 'Zytel 80G33' ex. Du Pont, which 
contain respectively about 43% and about 33% by weight of 
glass fibre.  The face insert suitably may be produced by 
compression- or injection-moulding. Its thickness may 
be, for example, in the range 1 to 4 mm, for instance 
2 mm. The material(s) of the main body of the head, 
to which the face insert is attached, may be selected 
from a wider range than those which normally are 
considered suitable for one-piece heads. The main 
body material(s) suitably may be of metal, plastics 
or resin, which may or may not contain a reinforcing 
material. For use with a glass reinforced nylon face 
insert, the main body material suitably is a metal, 
for instance steel, especially mild or stainless steel, 
which may be forged or cast, or a metal alloy for 
instance

<CLAIMS>
A golf iron head having a main body and, securely 
attached to the main body, a face insert located in a 

correspondingly shaped recess in the front face of the main 
body and wherein the face insert is mechanically 

interlocked with the recess by means of mating flange and 
groove formations on the peripheral walls of the insert and 

recess. 
A head according to Claim 1 wherein the face insert 
has a flexural modulus in the range of 1 to 20 GPa as 

measured at 23°C. 
A head according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the face 
insert has a Rockwell M hardness in the range 70 to 130. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
wherein the face insert comprises a thermoplastic nylon 

composite. 
A head according to Claim 4 wherein the face insert 
comprises a thermoplastic composite of nylon reinforced 

with glass fibre. 
A head according to Claim 5 wherein the ratio of 
glass:nylon in the composite is up to 60:40 by weight. 
A head according to Claim 5 or 6 wherein the glass 
fibre is of length in the range 0.2 to 3 mm. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
wherein the face insert has a sheet thickness in the range 

1 to 4 mm. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
wherein the face insert and recess have a quadrilateral 

peripheral shape positioned to have toe-side and heel-side 
walls and wherein the recess is open at the top edge of the 

head, and the top wall of the face insert is coincident 
with the top edge of the head. 
A head according to Claim 9 wherein the toe-side, 
heel-side and sole-side walls of the face insert have a 

continuous flange of partial dovetail tenon shape and the 
corresponding walls of the recess have a continuous groove 

of complementary partial dovetail mortise shape. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
 

wherein the rear edges of the flange and groove formations 
are coincident with the peripheral wall rear edges of the 

face insert and recess, and the front edges of the flange 
and groove formations are remote from the peripheral wall 

front edges of the face insert and recess. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
wherein the contacting corners of the face insert and 

recess are radiused. 
A head according to any of the preceding Claims 
wherein the face insert has grooving on its rear surface to

being out of coincidence with grooves which may be present 

on the front face of the face insert. 
A set of golf clubs comprising a series of irons 
having heads according to any of the preceding Claims.
