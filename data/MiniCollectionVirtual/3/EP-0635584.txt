<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to electronic radiation
detectors and more particularly to detectors which make use of
chemical vapor deposited diamond film.One type of solid state radiation detector has a strong
electric field established between two electrodes within free-standing
insulating material. When the insulating material is 
exposed to radiation of sufficient energy to bring electrons or
electron-hole pair carriers into the conduction band, the carriers
are swept to the electrodes by the electric field. Their arrival
at the electrodes can be measured by an electronic signal detection
device connected to the electrodes.It has already been recognized that diamond in general is a
particularly advantageous material for use in a solid state
particle detector, especially for SSC (superconducting super-collider)
particle physics research, because diamond is much more
resistant to radiation damage than are alternative detector
materials, such as silicon with a P-N junction. SSC accelerators
produce an intense amount of radiation at their collision points.
Silicon detectors suffer crystal structure defect damage in such an
environment which leads to an increased leakage current and a
decreased pulse height in their output signal. Furthermore, in
silicon, the maximum field that can be applied before avalanche
breakdown is about 103 V/cm. This limits the charge velocity to
approximately 106 cm/s, so that the collection time is at least 20ns
(nanoseconds) for a detector with a thickness of a few hundred
microns. However, such a long collection time can lead to
difficulty in interpreting results from an SSC accelerator, since
in such an accelerator the beam collisions occur on a timescale of
less than 20ns.It has also already been recognized that CVD (chemically vapor
deposited) diamond film is a particularly advantageous material for 
the detection of particle radiation. Diamond film of the CVD type
can be made with lower impurity levels than natural diamond or
diamond made by a high-temperature high-pressure process and can be
readily provided in the wafer geometry preferred for particle
detectors.For making a CVD diamond detector, a free-standing CVD diamond
film, typically several hundred microns thick, is metallized with
a complementary electrode pattern on each of its faces. The
dimensions of the electrode pattern will determine the spatial
resolution of the detector. A voltage is applied between the
electrodes, so that the electrons and holes will be accelerated to
their respective, opposite
