<ABSTRACT>
A faceplate (10a) for directly viewing an image generated by a digital 
micromirror device (10b), which generates images by tilting tiny mirror 

elements (11) to on or off positions. The faceplate (10a) has a number of 
optical fibres (12) parallel to each other and closely spaced together. The 

ends of the optical fibres (12) are the top and bottom surfaces of the faceplate 
(10a). Both ends of each fibre (12) is sliced at an angle determined by the on 

position of the mirror elements (11). This permits light to travel down the 
fibres (12) and be reflected back to the viewer by only those mirror elements 

(11) that are on.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display systems, and more particularly
to a direct view
display system of the type defined in the precharacterizing portion of
claim 1 and to a method as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 8.A display device of the type mentioned above is known from
EP-A-0 122 829. This display device comprises a faceplate
made of a fiber optic filter which provides a certain amount
of directional filtration and, on the other hand, permits a
geometric directional filter to be placed directly on an
image bearing surface. Setting the fibers of the faceplate
at an angle causes the acceptance cone of vision to be
shifted at the angle of the fibers.Real-time display systems based on spatial light modulators (SLMs)
are increasingly being used as an alternative to display systems using
cathode ray tubes (CRTs). SLM systems provide high resolution displays
without the bulk and power consumption of a CRT system.Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) are a type of SLM, and may be
used in display applications. A DMD has an array of micro-mechanical pixel
elements, each having a mirror and a memory cell. Each pixel element is
individually addressable by electronic data. Depending on the state of its
addressing signal, each mirror is tilted so that it either does or does not
reflect light to the image plane, i.e., so that it is on or off. The proportion of
time during each video frame that a mirror is in an on state determines
shades of gray -- from black for zero on time to white for 100 percent on time.Existing DMD display systems are projection systems. Light from the
on mirrors passes through a projection lens and creates images on a large
screen. Light from the off mirrors is reflected away from the projection lens
and trapped. Color may be added in two ways, by a color wheel or by a three-DMD
configuration.DMDs may be fabricated using semiconductor fabrication techniques.
To fabricate a DMD, standard CMOS processing steps are completed for a
static RAM, which comprises the memory cells, and for address electrodes.  
Then, a "roof' of tilting mirrors is fabricated over the memory and address
circuit. The height of this superstructure is enough to allow the mirrors to
tilt plus and minus 10 degrees or so about a torsion axis.The display optics for viewing the image generated by the DMD is
easily implemented for projection viewing. For example, the DMD may be
coupled with dark-field projection optics. Here, a bright light source is
directed to the chip at an angle to its surface. Mirrors
