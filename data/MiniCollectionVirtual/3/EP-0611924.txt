<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air curtain device (1) comprising a 
housing (3) to be arranged close to a passage opening in a 

building (2), which housing is provided with an elongate air 
outflow opening (6), air supply means connected to the opening (6) 

and air guiding means (7) for causing directed outflow out of 
the opening (6) of air supplied by the air supply means (10,30). The air 

supply means (10,30) herein comprise flow control means with which 
the supplied amount of air can be varied. The device further 

comprises valve means (11) for varying the active surface of the 
air outflow opening (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an air curtain device 
as described in the introductory part of claim 1. An air curtain device of this kind is known 
from DE-A-3 523 937. In this known device the flow 
control means increase the velocity of air flowing out of 
the guiding means with falling outside temperatures. The 
valve means increase the active surface of the air 
outflow opening and at the same time direct the air flow 
more outwardly, with increasing wind velocity. 
Accordingly the air curtain is adapted to changing 
weather conditions to maintain the separation between the 
climate in the building and the climate outside as good 
as possible. The invention has for its object to further 
improve an air curtain device of the type specified in 
the preamble. This object is achieved with the air curtain 
device according to the invention as characterized in 
claim 1. When it is for instance desired to supply more 
heat with the air curtain device because the outside 
temperature has for instance fallen, this can take place 
with the device according to the invention by increasing 
the amount of air. It is then unnecessary to increase the 
temperature of the outflowing air, which could be 
unpleasant for passers-by. The active surface of the air 
outflow opening is enlarged at the same time with the 
valve means so that the speed of the outflowing air 
remains the same and the efficiency and good operation of 
the device are retained. Holding the air speed constant 
is important because when the air speed increases the  
 
turbulence in the air flow increases, thereby resulting 
in increased mixing with the ambient air, in particular 
the outside air, which on the one hand results in 
immediate waste of energy and on the other causes some 
discomfort in the room area. A suitable embodiment of the device according 
to the invention is characterized in claim 2. When the 
amount of delivered air is increased by operation of the 
flow control means the buffer plate will be moved into 
another position as a result of the impulse of the air 
colliding therewith. Due to the active connection with 
the valve means the active surface of the air outflow 
opening is simultaneously altered. A further favourable development is 
characterized in claim 3. The supplied air strikes 
against the valve member whereby this functions as buffer 
plate which is moved by the outflowing air. The end edge 
of the valve member covers a larger or smaller portion of 
the air guiding means in accordance with the position of 
the valve

<CLAIMS>
Air curtain device (1) comprising a housing 
(3) to be arranged close to a passage opening in a 

building, which housing is provided with an elongate air 
outflow opening (6), air supply means (10) connected to 

the opening and air guiding means (7) for causing 
directed outflow out of the opening of air supplied by 

the air supply means (10), wherein the air supply means 
(10) comprise flow control means with which the amount of 

air supplied can be varied and wherein the device further 
comprises valve means for varying the active surface of 

the air outflow opening, 
characterized in that
 the flow 
control means and the valve means (11) are functionally 

coupled such that when there is a change in the amount of 
air supplied by the flow control means the valve means 

(11) change the active surface of the air outflow opening 
(6) in the same sense such that the speed of the outflowing air is held substantially constant. 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 1, 

wherein a movable buffer plate (11) urged by preloading 
means (13) in a direction counter to the air flow is 

arranged in the housing transversely of the air flow 
direction, which plate is actively connected to the valve 

means for adjusting these latter. 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the valve means comprise a valve member (11) 

which is pivotable on a shaft (12) parallel to the air 
guiding means and which is arranged in the air flow 

direction in advance of the air guiding means (7) and an 
end edge of which extends close to the air guiding means. 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the valve means comprise a fixedly mounted first 

perforated plate (28) and a second corresponding  
 

perforated plate (29) guided slidably thereon and an 
actuator (31) for sliding the second plate (29) relative 

to the first (28). 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein the percentage of openings in the perforated 

plate (28) is limited such that a relevant flow 
resistance is formed. 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein the air supply means comprise at least one fan 

(30) driven by an electric motor (35) and the actuator is 
an electrical actuator such as an electromagnet (31) or 

electric motor and wherein in the device are arranged 
control means controlling both the electric motor (35) 

and the actuator (31). 
Air curtain device as claimed in claim 6, 
wherein the control means can adjust the rotational speed 

of the electric motor (35) in a number of steps and 
wherein the valve means comprise a number of valves equal 

to that number of steps minus one.
