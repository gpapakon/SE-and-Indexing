<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for using microporous solid 
catalysts to convert oxygenates and substituted paraffins into olefinic 
hydrocarbons and, more particularly, relates to a process for converting 
alcohols into light olefins using ECR-1, mazmorite, or ECR-18 catalysts. Light olefins have traditionally been produced through the process of 
steam or catalytic cracking. Because of the limited availability and high cost 
of petroleum sources, the cost of producing light olefins from such petroleum 
sources has been steadily increasing. The search for alternative materials for light olefin production has led 
to the use of oxygenates such as alcohols, and more particularly to methanol, 
ethanol, and higher alcohols or their derivatives. These alcohols may be 
produced by fermentation or from synthesis gas. Synthesis gas can be 
produced from natural gas, petroleum liquids, carbonaceous materials, 
including coal, recycled plastics, municipal wastes, or any organic material. 
Thus, alcohol and alcohol derivatives may provide non-petroleum based 
routes for the production of olefin and other related hydrocarbons. Molecular sieves such as the microporous crystalline zeolite catalysts 
are known to promote the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbon mixtures. 
Numerous patents describe this process for various types of zeolite catalysts: 
US-A-3,928,483, 4,025,575, (Chang et al.); 4,496,786 (Santilli et al.); 4,547,616 
(Avidan et al.); 4,677,243 (Kaiser); 4,843,183 (Inui); 4,499,314 (Seddon et 
al.); and 4,447,669 (Harmon et al.). However, none of these patents teach 
the conversion of oxygenates to hydrocarbons using the type of zeolite 
catalysts described herein. US-A-4,467,133 (Chang, et al.) discloses the conversion of alcohols 
and ethers to hydrocarbons, wherein the zeolite can be paulingite. However, 
inclusion of Paulingite is incidental, and not intended to suggest that 
paulingite can be used to convert oxygenate feeds to olefins or to 
hydrocarbons containing substantially only light olefins. Most of the zeolites 
listed by Chang, et al., are well known to have no hydrocarbon porosity (such  
 
as analcite, noselite, phillipsite, datolite, leucite, scapolite, and kaolin). From 
this list, only faujasite, L, gmelenite, and mordenite have pores greater than 6 
angstroms, fitting the constraint index qualification of column 2 lines 43 to 53. 
From a catalytic perspective, Chang's list of zeolites has no significance. 
Rather, the list apparently refers to aluminosilicates in general, and
