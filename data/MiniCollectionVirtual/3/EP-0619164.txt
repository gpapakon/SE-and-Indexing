<ABSTRACT>
A processing machine comprises at least three 
powered guides (13,15,27) for movement along Cartesian axes 

for a support (12) to hold a tool (21) on a horizontal table 
(11). Motors (14,16,19) for movement along the three guides 

are connected to an integrated control device in the machine 
comprising a microprocessor sending to the motors movement 

signals reading data for position and moving from memories 
connected thereto. To the microprocessor are also connected 

a keyboard (130) for sending command signals and means (131) 
for display of operating information. The tool 21 is a 

router having its base (70) still attached so that a dust 
hood (76) incorporated in the base may be employed for dust 

extraction. A router (21) has a base (70) joined to a body 
(60) by columns (62,64), the latter being slidable in 

sleeves (66) in the body (60). A spring (90) between the 
base (70) and the body of the router serves as a guard for 

the router bit (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to machining centres and 
particularly to a router for such a machine or for 
independent use, and to guards therefor. A machining centre usually comprises a work table 
on which a processing tool, for example, a router or milling 
cutter, moves along three Cartesian axes. The centre may be 
controlled by a computer, e.g. a personal computer, in which 
must be first installed a processing program. A vertical 
guide supports a first carriage which runs along the guide 
by means of a first motor. The tool is fixed to the first 
carriage. The vertical guide is supported by a second 
carriage, running by means of a second motor along a first 
horizontal guide which is supported at one end by a third 
carriage running by means of a third motor along a second 
horizontal guide. The second horizontal guide is arranged at 
a right angle to the first horizontal guide, and the support 
moves along the three Cartesian axes over the horizontal 
work table. The three motors are connected to the computer, 
which may be integrated in the machine and may comprise a 
microprocessor sending to the motors signals for movement by 
reading position and movement data from memories connected 
thereto. In stationery machinery, such as the type to 
which the present invention relates, and where the tool is a 
standard router, or indeed any milling tool, it must be 
provided with guarding in order to protect operators from 
inadvertently contacting the tool bit and possibly injuring 
themselves. Such guarding is not normally available for 
hand held routers because the operator must hold the router 
and consequently has no occasion to insert his/her hand into 
contact with the tool bit. Moreover, it is highly desirable to provide dust 
extraction facilities, so that the environment around the 
centre can be kept clean and dust free. Hitherto, it has 
been the practice to surround the cutter of the tool with a  
 
depending curtain of brush, the interior of which is 
supplied with vacuum from a dust extraction device. Such an 
arrangement suffers a number of disadvantages, namely that 
the curtain shrouds the tool bit so that the cutter cannot 
be viewed by the operator, and secondly, at the maximum 
depth of cut, the brush is often so distorted by its contact 
with the workpiece that gaps appear which reduce the 
effectiveness of the extraction. Consequently, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a machining centre which overcomes 
these disadvantages, or at least mitigates their effects.

<CLAIMS>
A machining centre (10) comprising a tool 
(21) mounted in a frame for movement along three Cartesian 

axes (X,Y,Z), in which the tool is a router comprising a 
body (60) fixed to the frame and which body houses a motor 

driving a rotary tool bit (76) depending from said body, at 
least one column (62,64) being slidable with respect to said 

body along an axis parallel the rotation axis of said bit 
and mounting a router base (70) having an aperture (74) 

through which said tool is adapted to plunge to perform 
cutting operations, characterised in that said base 

comprises a hood (76) having openings (80) towards said bit 
and leading to a dust extraction port (84,86) for connection 

to a vacuum source. 
A centre as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
hood is received in said aperture, and has its own aperture 

(78) through which the tool bit is adapted to pass, said 
aperture having said opening (80) in a wall defining said 

aperture, which opening leads to a passage (82) around said 
aperture and said dust extraction port for connection to 

said vacuum source. 
A centre as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said tool comprises a body which houses a motor driving said 

rotary tool bit depending from said body, and a guard in the 
form of a coil spring (90) between said base and body and 

surrounding the rotation axis of said bit. 
A centre as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the 
spring has a pitch when fully extended which is insufficient 

to permit easy insertion of a standard finger between 
adjacent turns of the spring. 
A centre as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, wherein 
said spring is employed as the return spring for said base, 

and serves to bias the base and body apart. 
A centre as claimed in any preceding claim,

a) said tool; 
b) a first carriage (12) for the tool; 
c) a vertical guide (13) in which said first 
carriage runs;
