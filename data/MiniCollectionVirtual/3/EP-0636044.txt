<ABSTRACT>
A front clip for a safety binding with a housing base (3) securable to a ski and a housing top (2) which has at least one adjustable release spring (4) and two pivoting sole holders (14a, 14b) on which said release spring acts, in which, with the front clip in its operative position, the housing top (2) can pivot about a transverse axis (Q) running substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal central axis (L) of the front clip and the pivoting range of the housing top in relation to the housing base is limited by a horizontally movably fitted locking member (15, 115) in the base (3) or top (2) of the housing with at least one stop surface (32a1, 32b1, 32a2, 32b2, 32a3, 32b3, 32a4, 32b4). Said locking member (15, 115) co-operates, with the ski binding in the operative position, with a stop (29a, 29b) on the top or base of the housing so that the pivoting movement of the housing top in relation to the base is restricted in this position.
