<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a device aiming the administration, in humans and animals of therapeutical or diagnostic fluids, with the device already containing the fluid for injection, ready for use, eliminating the need for glass vials, ampules and conventional syringes. The device is constitued, basically, by a recipient (1), preferably made of plastic material, flexible, neutral not reacting with the fluid, pressure resistant, non elastic or little elastic for some applications, internally coated by a teflon film, with a conical or cylindrical shape in an upper view, oval in transversal cut-off, containing at its tapered portion (5) the terminal (6) with the fitting connection (7) and the tubular section (8) with the wing (9), heat sealed to the wall (3), reinforced by a pressure ring. For low injection volumes, the recipient (1) is placed between the plates (13) and (14), with the anterior tappered end of the upper plate (13) fitted under the upper catcher (18) fixed, by the pins (19) and (20), to the lower catcher (26) made part of the lower pressing plate (14). At the extremity of the upper pressing plate (13) there is the scale portion (21) with the injected volume indicator (22) that moves in the slot (23). Between the scale portion (21) and the extremity of the lower plate (14) it is placed the arm (27) connected to the foil (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Descriptive Report of the Patent of In vention: "MEDICATION INJECTING DEVICE AND ITS ACCESSORIES'.'The present invention refers to a de¬ vice intended to inject, in humans and animals, solutions for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, preferably, with the device already containing the fluid for injection, re ady for use, disposable, eliminating the need for the pre sent glass vials and bottles and conventional syringes.Presently, injectable solutions, inc- eluding pharmaceuticals and contrast media, are available being contained in glass vials, transferred, at the time of administration, to glass or plastic syringes. Syringes already containing contrast media and some pharmaceutic¬ als, ready for use, are also available. Another available device is the pressure injection pistol, usually for vac¬ cines administration thru the skin.Aiming to present a more efficient al¬ ternative, easier to use and more cost effective, to the conventional systems, by means of an injecting device al- ready containing the fluid simplifying procedures, the present medication injecting device and its accessories has been developed.The invention can be better understood with the detailed description of the attached schedules, being:The figure 1 illustrates the basic el¬ ement of the new device, being constituted by the main bo dy of the recipient (1) containing the injectable solu¬ tion, formed by molding or, preferably, by heat sealing of two plastic films, with a conical shape in an upper 

view, and oval in a transversal cut-off (cut-AA-) at its larger volume portion (2) , whose wall (3) is made, prefer¬ ably, of neutral plastic material, not reacting with the fluid for injection, flexible, pressure resistant, prefer- ably non elastic, or a little elastic for some applicat¬ ions, with a teflon inner coating (4) as needed, separating the fluid and the wall, increasing safety. At its tappered extremity (5) the recipient (1) is fixed, e.g. by heat se aling, to the terminal element (6) containing the fitt- ing connection luer-lock (7) , and the tubular section (8) with the wing (9) to be fixed to the inner face of the tappered wall (5) , with the tubular section (8) having its proximal end (12) (cut-BB-) preferably vertically depress; ed and laterally enlarged to conform to the container (1) depression at the time of fluid ejection. The external co ver (10) (cut-CC-) protects and maintains the fluid steri lity before use. At the luer-lock (7) , the standard nee¬ dle (11) is fitted.In the figure 2 it is illustrated an upper

 CLAIMS
1 - MEDICATION INJECTING DEVICE AND ITS ACCESSORIES, characterized by being constituted by the main recipient (1) containing the fluid for injection, pre ferably with a conical or cylindrical shape in an upper view and oval in transversal cut-off, with the larger vo¬ lume extremity (2) , opposite to the fluid ejection end, whose wall (3) is made, preferably, of neutral plastic ma terial, not reacting with the fluid, flexible, pressure resistant and non elastic or little elastic for some ap¬ plications, internally covered by a teflon coating (4) se parating the fluid and the wall, increasing safety.At its tappered end (5) the recipient (1) is heat sealed to the terminal element (6) , containing the fitting connection luer-lock (7) and the tubular section (8) with a wing (9) having its proximal end (12) vertically depressed and ho¬ rizontally enlarged. The fixing of the wall tappered end (5) and the tubular section (8) can be reinforced by a ring (36) . The cover (10) maintains the fluid sterility before use. At the luer-lock terminal (7) the standard in jecting needle (11) is fitted for fluid administration.
2 - MEDICATION INJECTING DEVICE AND ITS ACCESSORIES, according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that, for small volume injections, the recipient (1) be installed between two pressing plates (13) upper and (14) lower, fixed to the upper and lower external sur faces of the said recipient (1) by tappets (15) and (24) respectivelly fixed into the orifices (16) and (25) in the upper (13) and lower (14) pressing plates. At its ante- rior end the device has two catchers (18) upper and (26) 


lower, for handling at the time of injection to get firm¬ ness during the needle insertion, with the lower catcher being made, preferably, part of the lower pressing plate (14) . At the upper pressing plate (13) extremity there is the scale portion (21) with the injected volume indicator (22) that moves in the slot (23) . Between the scale por¬ tion (21) and the extremity of the lower plate (41) it is placed the arm (27) connected to the foil (28) .
