<ABSTRACT>
For washing one's back an elongated, flat pad (3) is provided, the surface of which is formed on both sides by a long-fibre plush and to the ends of which are joined two ribbons (5) which are to be held with both hands and by means of which the pad can be moved in contact with the back. The pad is to be inherently softer and more flexible than a brush with its more or less rigid basic structure. It is, however, to be considerably stiffer and more substantial than even a strong washcloth. This enables, together with the oblong, preferably elongated, flat shape, adaptation to the body curves, even the depression between the shoulder blades, and this with sufficient pressure over the entire area even though the pad (3) is held only at its ends by the ribbons (5). This is also assisted by the preferred wide dimensioning of the ribbons (5). The ribbons (5) transmit the force into the elongated, flat pad (3) over a relatively large width.
