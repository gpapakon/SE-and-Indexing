A method of steering a road vehicle with front-feel steering, 
which has a wheel base ℓ(in m), a front cornering stiffness 

c
v
(in N/rad), a centre of gravity distance ℓ
h
 (in m) from the 
rear axle and a mass m (in kg), and in which method the 

lateral acceleration a
v
 (in m/s²) at the front axle, the 
travelling speed v (in m/s), the steering wheel angle δ
L
 (in 
rad) and the yaw rate r (in rad/s) are measured and an output 

signal a
vsoll
 serving as command variable is formed from a 
measured steering angle (δ
L
) by a prefilter, characterized in 
that
 
after subtracting the lateral acceleration a
v
 from the output 
signal a
vsoll
 of the prefilter (1) in a following first adder 
member (2), the required time constant T of the steering 

transfer function is achieved by means of setting a gain 
factor 


k
p
 =  
m
ℓ
h
c
v
ℓ
T
 (in s/m) 
 
the reciprocal of the velocity v multiplied by the lateral 

acceleration a
v
 is added in form of 
(1/v) · a
v
 in a second 
adder member (4), so that a command variable w
v
 of the 
decoupling control in the form of 


w
v
 = 
k
p
(
a
vsoll
 - 
a
v
) + 
1
v
a
v
 (in l/s) 
 
is applied at the output of the second adder member (4);
  
 

by substracting the measured yaw rate r from the command 
variable w
v
 in a third adder member (5), an input quantity u 
required as an input signal for a steering motor (6) is 

obtained and at the output of the integrating steering motor 
(6) a quantity δ
v
 corresponding to the steering angle of the 
front wheels is then present which steering angle is linked via 

the differential equation of steering dynamics (7) by which the 
real vehicle is described, with the lateral acceleration a
v
 of 
the front axle fed back for controlling to the first and second 

adder members (2, 4) and with the yaw rate r fed back to the 
third adder member (5), so that by such an integrating feed 

back of the signal corresponding to the yaw rate r to the front 
wheel steering, the yaw movement is decoupled from the lateral 

movement of the front axle.
