<ABSTRACT>
An antifouling paint composition containing as the active ingredient a heavy metal compound and a copper salt of 2-pyridinethiol 
1-oxide, represented by general formula (I), wherein n represents 1 or 2. The composition is not only excellent in antifouling 

performance, but also lowly toxic and safe for the human body, does not cause gelation, and is excellent in a long-term storage 
stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antifouling
paint composition. More specifically, the present
invention relates to an antifouling paint composition
which is able to prevent various aquatic organisms from
adhering to a surface of an underwater structure such as a
ship, harbour facilities, a buoy, a submarine station, a
conduit of a power station, or a net for aquaculture, by
painting the surface thereof.Many aquatic organisms of various kinds such as
Balanus, Ascidiacea, Serpula, Cristaria and Enteromorpha
are living in the sea, the river, lakes and marshes. The
aquatic organisms adhere to an underwater surface of a
structure having an underwater part, such as an equipment
placed in water or a ship's hull, and cause various
damages. For example, when the aquatic organisms adhere
to a hull, the resistance in water increases, and the
navigation speed decreases, and then a consumption of
additional fuel is necessary to keep the same speed. When
the aquatic organisms adhere to an equipment placed in
water, not only the normal function of the equipment is
disturbed, but also sometimes the corrosion of the
equipment is promoted.In order to prevent the above-mentioned adhesion
of the aquatic organisms for a long term, an antifouling
paint has been used. The antifouling paint is classified
into two types: soluble matrix type and insoluble matrix
type. In case of the antifouling paint of soluble matrix
type, the effect is exerted by releasing the contained
antifouling component into water. Generally, not only an
antifouling component but also all components in the film
are released from the outer layer into water. In case of 
the antifouling paint of insoluble matrix type, a soluble
component such as an antifouling component is released
into water, but an insoluble resin remains.Hitherto, a tin compound having broad
antibacterial spectrum, such as TBT (tributyltin) or TPT
(triphenyltin), has been widely used as an antifouling
component. However, the use of the tin compound is
limited strictly because the compound has high toxicity.The antifouling effect of a copper compound
represented by cuprous oxide has been known for a long
time, and the safety thereof is also high. Especially,
cuprous oxide has been often used as an antifouling
component because it has suitably low solubility in water
and is more inexpensive than other organic antifouling
components. However, the antifouling effect of cuprous
oxide against Ulotrichaceae and Enteromorpha is
insufficient. Thus, cuprous oxide by itself could not
keep away
