<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at reducing a cost by avoiding the use of concentrated ¹⁷O and to make it possible to obtain accurate 
data on metabolism without undergoing any change in a signal intensity due to the influences of the blood circulated later 

even when a large amount of an NMR agent is dosed. The NMR agent of this invention is characterized in that it contains 
oxygen at least in such a concentration as to be necessary for maintaining life and the content of an oxygen isotope ¹⁷O in 

the oxygen is set to be less than a natural occurrence. It can be produced extremely economically by concentrating ¹⁶O, for 
example, and even when a large quantity of the agent is dosed, it mixes with the blood having a high H₂¹⁷O concentration 

during circulation inside the body, and the H₂¹⁷O content in the blood as a whole does not change much. Accordingly, the 
circulating blood does not greatly affect the signal inten
sity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a nuclear magnetic 
resonance agent which is used upon causing hydrogen H in 
H₂¹⁶O present in a living body to nuclear magnetic resonance 
and detecting change with time of resonance signals thereof. Nuclear magnetic resonance tomography (NMR-CT) used 
for a nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic method can 
conduct tomograph for an inclined surface at an optional 
angle more easily as compared with conventional X-ray CT 
scanners, further does not suffer from hindrance for imaging 
by bones or air and has extremely high safety with no 
worry of causing X-ray exposure. Then, tomographic images are formed, for instance, by 
irradiating sinusoidal signals depending on the resonance 
frequency of hydrogen atom H to a living body and detecting 
the state of the proton of hydrogen H present as a water 
content H₂O in the living body by detecting resonance 
signals. By the way, oxygen includes, in addition to ordinary 
oxygen ¹⁶O, radioisotope ¹⁵O and stable isotope ¹⁷O and ¹⁸O,  
 
in which the stable isotope ¹⁷O has quite the same chemical 
property as that of ordinary oxygen ¹⁶O and, accordingly, 
it gives no undesired effects at all when it is intaken 
into the living body and is served to the metabolism in 
the same manner as ordinary oxygen. In view of the above, the present inventor, et al 
have proposed a nuclear magnetic resonance agent capable 
of obtaining information on the metabolism by inhaling 
oxygen isotope ¹⁷O in the form of an oxygen gas to produce 
H₂¹⁷O by the metabolic function and detecting the intensity 
change of resonance signals by the effect thereof (refer 
to Japanese Patent Laid-Open Hei 3-167843). According to this, since H₂¹⁷O is produced and increased 
by the metabolism of living cells merely by inhaling 
the nuclear magnetic resonance agent, if NMR-CT detects, 
for example, the proton of H₂O, since the relaxation 
time for the proton is shortened for a portion in 
which the metabolism is vigorous to produce a great amount 
of H₂¹⁷O, the signal intensity is weakened, whereas the 
signal intensity does not change for a portion in which 
the metabolism is failed to produce no H₂¹⁷O such as a 
focal portion. Accordingly, it can be judged simply where a focal 
portion is present by detecting the change of the signal 
intensity or observing the change of the brightness of  
 
tomograph images based on the resonance signals. However, in a case of finding the focal portion by 
the effect of H₂¹⁷O, while it is judged that a portion in which 
the signal
