<ABSTRACT>
A fine-particle inorganic filler whose individual particles consist of a macrofiller particle of glass and microfiller particles, which partially cover the macrofiller particle and are firmly connected to it by sintering, of glass or ceramic is described. Plastic materials reinforced with the filler are distinguished by improved abrasion resistance.

Process for the preparation of a finely divided
inorganic filler in the form of a composite filler

comprising macrofiller particles and microfiller
particles, characterized in that, for the preparation of

composite filler particles which each consist of a
macrofiller particle and a number of microfiller

particles partly covering said macrofiller particle and
which have a mean particle size of 0.3 - 12 micrometers,

an intimate mixture of a) a glass macrofiller particle
having a lower boiling point than the microfiller

particles and having a mean particle size of 0.2 -
