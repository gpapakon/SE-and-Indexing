<ABSTRACT>
To the end of reliably and accurately detecting a 
failure to properly eject a master plate (S) and positively 

preventing the occurrence of secondary failures due to 
a failure to properly eject a master plate (S), the passage 

of both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the 
ejected master plate (S) beyond a prescribed point in the 

conveying path of ejected master plates (S) is used as an 
indication of a successful ejection of a master plate (S). 

An ejected master plate sensor (61) for detecting the 
presence of a master plate (S) in a path for conveying a 

stencil master plate (S) to an ejected master plate 
receiving box (57) is provided in the conveying path, and 

the state of the ejected master plate sensor (61) is 
monitored if the change of its state from the one 

indicating the absence of a master plate (S) to the one 
indicating the presence of a master plate (S) is followed 

within a prescribed time period by the change of its 
state from the one indicating the presence of a master 

plate (S) to the one indicating the absence of a master 
plate (S) so that a start of a next operation may be 

permitted when such a sequence of the change of the 
state of the stencil master plate detecting sensor (61) took 

place, and a start of a next operation may be otherwise 
prohibited as being a case of a failure to properly 

eject a stencil master plate (S).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil 
printing device equipped with a stencil master plate 
ejecting device, and in particular to a stencil 
printing device equipped with a stencil master plate 
ejecting device for removing a stencil master plate 
mounted around an outer circumferential surface of a 
printing drum and conveying it to an ejected master 
plate receiving unit. Already known is a stencil printing device 
equipped with a stencil master plate ejecting device in 
which a stencil master plate mounted around the outer 
circumferential surface of a printing drum is peeled 
off therefrom by using a peeling claw, and the thus 
removed stencil master plate is conveyed to a master 
plate receiving unit by master plate ejecting feed 
rollers. Such stencil master plate ejecting devices 
are disclosed for instance in Japanese utility model 
laid open publication (kokai) No. 58-3266 and Japanese 
utility model publication (kokoku) No. 04-18867. Conventionally, such a stencil printing device is 
provided with stencil master plate detecting means for 
detecting the presence of a stencil master plate in the 
path of conveying stencil master plates to an ejected 
master plate receiving unit, and the state of the 
stencil master plate detecting means is monitored if it 
changes from the one indicating the absence of a 
stencil master plate to the one indicating the presence 
of a stencil master plate within a prescribed time 
period after the issuance of the command to start the 
operation of ejecting a stencil master plate so that a 
start of a next operation may be permitted when such a  
 
sequence of the change of the state of the stencil 
master plate detecting means took place, and a start of 
a next operation may be otherwise prohibited as being a 
case of a failure to properly eject a stencil master 
plate. This process of determining the occurrence of a 
failure to properly eject a stencil master plate is 
based on the detection of the leading edge of the 
stencil master plate that is to be ejected as it passes 
through the conveying path leading to the ejected 
master plate receiving unit, and, therefore, the 
succeeding operation of the stencil printing device is 
permitted as if the ejection of the stencil master 
plate were completely executed even though it is 
possible that the leading edge of the stencil master 
plate to be ejected has passed through the conveying 
path leading to the ejected master plate receiving unit 
but may have failed to be delivered to the ejected 
master plate

A stencil printing device equipped with a master 
plate ejecting dev

plate mounted around an outer circumferential surface 

of a printing drum and conveying it to an ejected 
master plate receiving unit, comprising: 


stencil master plate detecting means for detecting 
presence of a stencil master plate in a path for 

conveying a stencil master plate to said stencil master 
plate receiving unit; and 
control means for allowing a next operation to be 
carried out only when it has determined from an output 

from said stencil master plate detecting means that a 
stencil master plate removed from said printing drum 

has passed through a prescribed point in said stencil 
master plate conveying path. 
A stencil printing device according to claim 1, 
wherein said control means determines from an output 

from said stencil master plate detecting means that a 
stencil master plate removed from said printing drum 

has passed through a prescribed point in said stencil 
master plate conveying path when it has determined that 

a trailing edge of said stencil master plate has passed 
said prescribed point. 
A stencil printing device according to claim 2, 
wherein said control means determines from an output 

from said stencil master plate detecting means that a 
stencil master plate removed from said printing drum 

has passed through a prescribed point in said stencil 
master plate conveying path when it has determined that 

a trailing edge of said stencil master plate has passed 
said prescribed point followed by a passage of a  

 
leading edge of said stencil master plate within a 

prescribed time period. 
A stencil printing device according to claim 3, 
wherein said control means determines that a stencil 

master plate removed from said printing drum has passed 
through a prescribed point in said stencil master plate 

conveying path when it has determined that a change of

plate to a state indicating presence of a stencil 

master plate is followed within said prescribed time 
period by a change of a state of said stencil master 

plate detecting means from a state indicating presence 
of a stencil master plate to a state indicating absence 

of a stencil master plate. 
A stencil printing device according to claim 1, 
further comprising stencil master plate ejection 

failure warning means for warning a failure to properly 
eject a stencil master plate when such a failure is 

detected by said control means. 
A stencil printing device equipped with a master
