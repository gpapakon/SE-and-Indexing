<ABSTRACT>
There is a demand for very clear tough polymers or polymer blends, 
particularly in the packaging industry. Crystal polystyrene is clear but lacks 

toughness. HIPS is tough but lacks the required clarity. Blends of styrene-ester 
polymers with a very small amount of HIPS do provide a very clear tough 

polymer alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to clear, toughened blends having a low 
haze. These blends are useful in household articles and rigid packaging such as 
containers or e.g. boxes. General purpose or crystal polystyrene is used in a number of 
applications, including household and rigid packaging, where clarity or 
translucency is required. While general purpose polystyrene is suitable for such 
applications, it has a fairly low toughness. That is, it has low impact 
resistance. This drawback can be overcome by incorporating rubber into the 
polystyrene but it results in a loss of clarity or increasing haze. US-A-5,079,296, issued January 7, 1992 to the assignee 
herein, discloses clear tough alloys. However, to obtain the combination of 
clarity and toughness, it is necessary to use a three component system, namely: 
(i) a brittle polymer which is a clear thermoplastic; (ii) a block copolymer (typically K resin ®); and (iii) an impact modified polymer (e.g. HIPS). The K resin ® is a relatively expensive component in the above blend. 
Applicants have discovered a blend having high clarity and good toughness 
while eliminating an essential component of US-A-5 079 296. There is a need for a relatively tough, clear polymer blend. The present invention provides a polymer blend 
characterised by comprising or consisting essentially of:  
 
(1) from 97 to 99 weight % of a 
copolymer comprising or consisting essentially of: 
(a) from 70 to 90 weight % of one or more monomers 
selected from: styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, 
p-methyl styrene, and t-butyl styrene; and (b) from 30 to 10 weight % of one or more monomers selected 
from: methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, 
methyl acrylate, and butyl acrylate; and (2) from 3 to 1 weight % of an impact 
modified polymer comprising or consisting essentially of: 
(a) from 4 to 15 weight % of a rubbery polymer selected from 
from : 
(i) co- and homopolymers of C4-6 
conjugated diolefins; and (ii) copolymers comprising: 
(A) from 60 to 80 weight % of one or more C4-6 
conjugated diolefins; and (B) from 40 to 20 weight % of one or more 
monomers selected from styrene, 
alpha-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, 
and t-butyl styrene,  
to which has been grafted at least a portion of:  
 (b) from 85 to 96 weight % of a polymer prepared by 
polymerizing a monomer mixture comprising: 
(i) from 100 to 70 weight % of one or more monomers 
selected from: styrene, alpha-methyl 
styrene, p-methyl styrene, and t-butyl styrene; and (ii) from 0 to 30 weight % of one or more monomers
