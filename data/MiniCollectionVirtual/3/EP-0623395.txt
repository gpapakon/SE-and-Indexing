<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, it is proposed to influence the decay characteristic and decay period of an ultrasonic transducer by electrical means so that reflections of the spurious spectra are largely suppressed. In this arrangement, the transmitting power of a pulse sequence is reduced in accordance with a predetermined envelope curve. The circuit arrangement can be used for measuring distances between motor vehicles.

Circuit arrangement for attenuating an ultrasonic 
transducer which is designed for operating both as a 

transmitter and as a receiver, the circuit arrangement 
having a generator (4) and the generator (4) being 

designed to control the drive voltage (V) for the ultrasonic 
transducer (32) in such a way that the amplitude, 

corresponding to the drive voltage, of the emitted 
ultrasonic transducer signal decays in accordance with a 

prescribed envelope for the decay period (V), characterized 
in that the generator (4) has a further means (20, 

21) by means of which the prescribed envelope (V) 
initially drops within a period t1 to a voltage value U1 

other than zero, and in that subsequently the voltage 
value U1 of the envelope (V) is virtually constant for a 

specific period T-t1. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the generator (4) has a means (2) by 

means of which the prescribed envelope (V) of the drive 
voltage drops approximately to the value of zero after 

the period T. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the means (2) has an RC element (1, 2) 

connected as a low-pass filter. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the further means (20, 21) has a low-resistance 

scurce (20) which is connected upstream of the 
drive circuit (3) and has a diode (21) connected in 

series. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the ultrasonic  

 
sensor (32) is arranged in the shunt arm of a transistor 

bridge circuit (61, 62, 63, 64), in that the transistors 
(61, 62, 63, 64) can be driven in antiphase via their 

inputs (U
S1
, U
S2
) in the operational case, and in that the 
bridge is connected to the generator (4) for the purpose 

of supply. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the circuit 

arrangement can be used for distance measurement on a 
motor vehicle. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the circuit arrangement can be used as a 

parking aid.
