<CLAIMS>
Hair roller for a permanent wave, having a hollow cylindrical roller body (1) of small
diameter, which at one end (2) is closed and at the other end (5) has an opening

corresponding to the internal diameter of the tubular body, into which opening hair
treatment agents can be introduced, and having a holding means, especially a fastening

band (4) or fastening clip (14), which is arranged to be attached to the roller body (1) at
both ends, 
characterized in that
 a cylindrical wall of the roller body (1) has, at least in a
central region (12), a lattice-like structure composed of rods which cross one another,

and the other end (5) of the roller body (1) forms, for accommodating an outlet of a spray
container holding the hair treatment agent, an insertion socket of crown-shaped

construction having a plurality of notches (6), in which notches (6) one end of the holding
means (4, 14) is arranged to be attached.
Hair roller according to claim 1, characterized in that the tubular roller body has
encircling stabilisation rings (7).
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that both
ends (2, 5) of the roller body (1) have an enlarged diameter, on the periphery of which

ends (2, 5) there are arranged grooves (15) for better handling.
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the closed

end (2) of the roller body (1) has a spherical seating for the loop of the fastening
band (4), which seating can also be used for the snap-fit device of a fastening clip (14).
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the crown-shaped
open end (5) has an internal diameter larger than the internal diameter of the

tubular roller body (1).
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the lattice-like
wall of the roller is completely or partially surrounded by a highly air-permeable

band (10) having nylon hooks or loops or mushroom-shaped elements. 
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that, near the
ends (13), the lattice-like wall is closed at its circumference.
Hair roller according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the interior
of the tubular roller is completely or partially filled with absorbent material.
