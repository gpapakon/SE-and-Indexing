<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable protective helmet (20) for sporting activities comprising a first shell (22)
and second shell (24), having respective cooperating inner and outer overlapping

portions (46,47) extending transversely across the top portion of the wearer's head
for connecting together the shells (22,24) to form a bowl shaped shell assembly

circumscribing the wearer's head. The shells (22,24) are movable relative to one
another in the overlapping portions (46,47) to provide size adjustability of the helmet.

The helmet (20) includes a shock absorbing liner (19) inside the shell assembly. The
shell assembly comprises a ramp (60) defined by a plurality of raised formations

on the inside surface of the shell assembly, that is adjacent and facing a free
edge of the inner overlapping portion (47) thereby increasing the contact surface

area between the liner (19) and the shell assembly around said overlapping
portions (46,47) in order to reduce the concentration of force of an impact in the

vicinity of the overlapping portions (46,47).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable protective helmet for sporting
activities and more particularly, to an improved adjustable helmet for use by
hockey players.Protective helmets comprising adjustability features are well known. In this
regard, it is known to provide an adjustable helmet having two shell portions
that are held together by screws. The loosening and tightening of the screws
allow for adjustment of the helmet. In use, the two shell portions are fixedly
held together, thus are adapted to move relative to one another when the
screws are loosened. When the desired size is obtained, the screws are
tightened and the two shell portions are locked in place. The two shell
portions usually have overlapping surfaces to enable the shell portions to be
moved relative to one another while not leaving any gap between the two
shell portions. Shock-absorbing foam padding is positioned inside the helmet
shells to cushion the wearer's head. For practical reasons, there are usually
two sections of padding: One section of padding being attached to each shell
portion of the protective helmet. This arrangement simplifies the assembly of
padding and shell portions and also facilitates assembly of the components.An important drawback of this known configuration is that the overlapping
surfaces of the two shell portions create a step or ridge on the inner surface
of the shell assembly directly above the head of the player. More particularly,
in the area of the separation of the two shell portions, the interior curvature of
the helmet shell is broken by the feature of adjustability of the helmet. This
seems to creates an area of concentration of forces. When an impact occurs,
the step or ridge has a tendency to dig into the foam padding and apply a 
localized force to the head of the wearer, which is highly undesirable in a
protective helmet. A protective helmet's main task is to spread the force of
impact to as wide a surface as possible without bottoming out, in order to
absorb impact and prevent injuries to the cranium.A second drawback of this known configuration of an adjustable helmet is the
reduced amount of foam padding at the junction of two padding sections. For
practical reasons, the foam padding sections separation coincides with the
shell portions separation. This arrangement entails that when the shell
portions are spaced apart, a gap is formed between the padding sections in
the area where the two shell portions overlap each other. As a result, certain
circumstances may leave an area of

An adjustable protective helmet for sporting activities comprising a first
shell and second shell, one of said shells covering the forehead and a

portion of the sides of a wearer's head, and the other one of said shells
covering the top, back and a portion of the sides of a wearer's head; said

first and second shells having respective cooperating inner and outer
overlapping portions extending transversely across the top portion of the

wearer's head for connecting together said shells to form a bowl shaped
shell assembly circumscribing the wearer's head; said inner overlapping

portion lying inwardly of said outer overlapping portion and its associated
shell; said shells movable relative to one another in said overlapping

portions to provide size adjustability of said helmet; said helmet including
a shock absorbing liner inside said shell assembly; said shell assembly

comprising a ramp defined by a plurality of raised formations on the inside
surface of said shell assembly, said ramp adjacent and facing a free edge

of said inner overlapping portion thereby increasing the contact surface
area between said liner and said shell assembly around said overlapping

portions in order to reduce the concentration of force of an impact in the
vicinity of said overlapping portions.

located in the central portion of said inside surface of said shell assembly.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 2 wherein said raised
formations define a plan substantially co-planar with a plan defined by the

inside surface of said inner overlapping portion.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 3 wherein said raised
formations are a series of ribs extending from said overlapping portions.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 4 wherein said series
of ribs decreases in height from said overlapping portions to blend with an

inner curvature of said shell assembly.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 3 wherein said raised
formations extend longitudinally from said overlapping portions.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 6 wherein said raised
formations extend substantially perpendicular to said overlapping portions.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 4 wherein said ramp is
a means for providing a smooth inner curvature of said inside surface of

said shell assembly.

defined by a plurality of raised formations laid out in a criss-cross pattern.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 1 wherein said liner is
made of a foam material.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 10 wherein said liner is
made of dual density having a hard back foam contacting said shell

assembly and a softer foam contacting the wearer's head.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 10 wherein said liner
comprises a plurality of foam material sections juxtaposed to each other to

substantially cover said inside surface of said shell assembly.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 12 wherein said
sections are juxtaposed to each other in a location ahead of said

overlapping portions.
An adjustable protective helmet as defined in claim 12 wherein said
sections are juxtaposed to each other in a location behind of said
