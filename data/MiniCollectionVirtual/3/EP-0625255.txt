A water heater with a gas inlet (8) for a mixture of combustion gas and air, an 
inlet for fluid (2) to be heated, at least two combustion stages (16, 20) traversed by the 

mixture of combustion gas and air and having catalytic combustion chambers which are 
at least partially surrounded by a fluid chamber (4, 7) filled with the fluid (2), and a 

waste gas heat exchanger traversed in different chambers by this fluid (2) and by the 
waste gas leaving the combustion chambers, wherein the second combustion stage (20) 

is designed as a monolithic burner (18, 19, 38, 39), characterized in that the first 
combustion stage (16) is designed as a catalytic gap burner (11), wherein the 

combustion gap which forms the combustion chamber of the first combustion stage 
(16) and is traversed by the gas mixture is defined between a wall (30) on the fluid 

chamber (4) side clad with a ceramic layer (14) and a side (12, 31) coated with a 
catalyst layer, and in that the gap width is so predetermined in dependence on the 

throughflow speed given by the gas throughput that the flame backfiring speed is 
smaller that the said throughflow speed. 
A water heater according to claim 1, characterized in that the combustion gas 
mixture can pass in counter-flow over the rear side of the wall (31) carrying the 

catalyst layer (13) to preheat the gas mixture before its introduction into the catalytic 
combustion gap. 
A water heater according to either of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the monolithic burner (18, 38) can be traversed in the plane normal to the flow 

direction of the gas mixture only through a predetermined area (32, 36) in a central 
region (21) of the gas mixture emerging from the first combustion stage (16), so that 

the remaining edge regions (35) of the second combustion stage (20) are not involved 
in the conversion process and form a heat shield for the outer wall (1) of the water 

heater.  
 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
an electric heating coil (34) surrounds the feed pipe (25) in the region of the inlet (8) 

for the gas mixture into the first combustion stage (16), for preheating the same, and 
in that a temperature sensor is provided in the region of the catalytic combustion gap 

(11) of the first combustion stage (16), whereby the heating coil (34) be switched on 
by the temperature signal of the temperature sensor when there is a low gas mixture 

temperature and can be switched off on reaching a predetermined gas mixture 

temperature. 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that a 
distributing and turbulence gap (17) is provided between the two combustion stages (16 

and 20). 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the fluid jacket (4) containing the fluid (2) to be heated is arranged only around the 

first combustion stage (16). 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the monolithic burner (18, 38) has the form of a catalyst honeycomb (38). 
A water heater according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 
monolithic burner (18, 38) has the form of a catalyst foam (18). 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
at least one turbulence chamber (9) is provided in the feed channel for the gas mixture. 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the catalyst layer (13) of the first combustion stage is applied to a thin metallic 

substrate layer (12, 31), so that good heat distribution along the conversion region of 
the combustion gap (11) is ensured.  

 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the catalyst material (13, 19, 39) consists of platinum, palladium or oxide materials. 
A water heater according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the combustion gas is an alkane or an alcohol.
