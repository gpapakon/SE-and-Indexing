<ABSTRACT>
A spacer, in particular for replacing an intervertebral disk, has a convex wall (1) with a plurality of recesses (4, 5) provided in the wall and a plurality of indentations (6) at both edges of the wall. In order to dispense with the need for the surgeon to keep in stock different models for the different cross-sections, the indentations (6) have detachable sections (7) which allow the cross-sectional shape to be trimmed.

<CLAIMS>
Spacer for intervertebral disc, with a shell-like wall (1) with a plurality of cut-outs
(4, 5) in the wall and a plurality of teeth (6) with portions which can be taken off on the two

edges of the wall (1), wherein the two edges are inclined relative to one another so that the

spacer has a wedge-shaped cross-section and the height of the cut-outs (4, 5) viewed in the
direction between the two edges on one side of the shell decreases from a greatest value to a

smallest value on the opposite side of the shell.
Spacer for an intervertebral disc according to Claim 1, characterised in that the cut-outs
in the wall (1) are constructed as quadrilaterals or rhombi (5) which extend substantially

in the axial direction of the hollow body.
Spacer for an intervertebral disc according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
inclination is between 8째 and 12째.
Spacer for an intervertebral disc according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
inclination is between 9째 and 11째.
Spacer for an intervertebral disc according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the cross-section of the cavity surrounded by the shell is oval.
