<ABSTRACT>
A device comprises a vehicle (1) on which is fitted a steam generator (2) to whose steam outlet are connected steam nozzles (4', 4'') which form at least one nozzle beam (5') extending substantially across the width of the roadway transversely to the direction of travel (F) and fitted beneath the vehicle (1) chassis by means of an adjustable-height support and having lateral support sections (7) with nozzle beam sections (5') which may be pivoted about a pin (B) aligned in the direction of travel and which are adjustable vertically and laterally. The support and lateral support sections (7) take the form of a casing open at the bottom with a base (6') and side (6'') and face (6''') walls, and the nozzle beam (5') is adjustable in the direction of travel on the casing base and is fitted to pivot about a pin running transversely to the direction of travel, and has at least two rows of nozzles (4', 4'') at different angles to the direction of travel.

Device for destroying unwanted vegetation in the 
region of roadways, in particular on railway track beds, 

with a vehicle (1), in particular a rail vehicle, on which 
is mounted a steam generating unit (2) to the steam outlet 

of which are connected steam nozzles forming at least one 
nozzle beam (5) which extends transversely to the direction 

of travel essentially across the width of the roadway and 
which is mounted beneath the frame of the vehicle by means 

of a support (6) of adjustable height which extends in the 
direction of travel and which is designed as an open-bottomed 

hood with a top, side walls in the direction of 
travel and end walls, wherein side support portions (7) 

which extend in the direction of travel and are pivotable 
about an axis (B) extending in the direction of travel, and 

which are in each case also designed as a hood and mounted 
with their pivot axis (B) on the vehicle (1) both 

adjustable in height and displaceable transversely to the 
direction of travel, and with nozzle beam sections (5") 

which extend in extension of the nozzle beam (5') which is 
mounted adjustably on the hood top in the direction of 

travel, preferably in the first front third of the support 
extent in the direction of travel, pivotable about a pivot 

axis (A) extending transversely to the direction of travel 
and comprises at least two rows (4', 4") of nozzles 

directed towards the ground and inclined differently to the 
direction of travel. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
support is divided relative to the longitudinal centre 

plane (M) of the vehicle (1), wherein each support portion 
(6) is also provided in the region of the longitudinal 

centre plane with a side wall (6") and adjustable in height 
independently. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the  
 

side walls (6") and end walls (6"') of the support or of 
each support portion (6, 7) are formed in each case by a 

heat-insulating double casing. 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that, in the horizontal position of the nozzle beam or 

of the nozzle beam sections (5', 5"), one nozzle row (4') 
is oriented vertically and the other (4") is oriented 

obliquely to the direction of travel (F). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the steam generating unit (2) is formed by a steam 

boiler (9) with output pressure regulator supplied from a 
water tank (11) via a pump (10), wherein the pump is 

supplied electrically by a diesel power unit (12) and the 
steam boiler (9) is heated by a gas burner (13) supplied by 

gas bottles (14).
