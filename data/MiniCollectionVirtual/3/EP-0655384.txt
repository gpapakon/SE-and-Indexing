<ABSTRACT>
The retention component is formed by two grip jaws (7,8) which at their front end are joined to one another by a hinge axis (9) parallel to the guide and at their rear end they are located along guide components (3,4). The grip jaws on their insides have a profile corresp. to the engaged tyre and rim of the front wheel. The grip jaws correspond to the negative form of parts of the front wheel clamped between them. Between the pref. elastically bendable grip jaws two or three accommodations are provided one behind the other for tyres of various thicknesses. The guide components are inclined or bent in the direction of travel of the bicycle and/or crossways to it.

Appliance to hold bicycles in vertical position by the help of a holding-organism 

sliding along an almost verticl frame for each bicycle,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the vertical conducting (frame) for the sliding holding-organism is 

developed of parallel running bars, tubes or ropes in pairs, which reduce their 
inbetween distance the higher they come and which operate together with the 

sliding holding organism in that way that the pressing energie of the holding 
organism increases towards the front wheel while advancing higher. 
 
Appliance according to claim 1,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the holding organism essentially is shaped of two grab-cheeks (7,8) which 

are joined together at their front end by an hinge axe (9) running parallel to 
the frame and that at their behind end are carried along each on one of the 

parallel running bars (3, 4). 
 
Appliance according to claim 2,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the grab cheeks (7, 8) are furnished with a profile inside that conforms to 

the held front wheel (6) and its felloe. 
 
Aplliance according to claim 2,
 
characterized in a way,
  
 

that the grab cheeks (7, 8) conform to negative shape of the held front wheel's 
parts. 
 
Appliance according to claims 2-4,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that between the prefered flexible and bendable grab cheeks (7,8) two or 

three holdings are provided, one behind the other (a, b, c) to hold different 
wheel measures. 
 
Appliance according to claims 1-5
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the parallel running bars (3, 4) are bent in the bicycle's driving forward 

position and/or across towards it are bent as well. 
 
Appliance according to claim 6,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the running bars (3, 4) are more bent together especially in the height of 

the front-wheel's axel in lower postion (3a, 4a) and/or in driving forward 
position than in the upper area. 
 
Appliance according to claims 1-7,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that between the running bars (3, 4) there is installed in driving forward 

position an inclined rising running-on surface or else a lifting barrier whose 
height, length and rise are apportioned and adjusted towards the running bars 

in a way that the lower part of the behind wheel's mud-guard is lifted from the 
floor during the last phase of running up and keeps the mud-guard in distance 

to its environment.  
 
 
Aplliance conforming to claim 8,
 
characterized in a way,
 
that the running-on inclined rise and its following run-down inclination are built 

as a balance situated above the floor and swinging around its horizontal axel.
