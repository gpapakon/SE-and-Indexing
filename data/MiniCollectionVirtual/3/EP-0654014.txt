<ABSTRACT>
The object of this invention is a new conditioner apparatus fit to transform the physical characteristics of the water, as it is able to determine the suspension of the lime, present in said water, without allowing it to settle as solid scaling along the walls of the pipes, of boilers and the like. The said apparatus is composed of two parallelepiped magnetic elements (4, 5), enclosed in a different way in an iron tubular casing (3), making to ensure that the water, which is forced to flow through the spaces in between these, undergoes the aforementioned physical transformations, as they are forced to pass through the magnetic field formed by them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The above mentioned invention is a new instrument with magnetic 
properties, for application to water works so that it will enable the water to 
reach the areas where it is to be used, without scaling pipes and tanks. At the moment, among the many known anti-calcareous magnetic water 
conditioning instruments, there is one which has been studied and perfected 
and which is capable of equipping the water works which convey the water 
where it is to be used. Many are the instruments which have been 
manufactured, and all of them are in more or less a position to carry out their 
function of intercepting the water which is made to pass through them. 
This new instrument has also been studied and tested in order to 
avoid the difficulties which create many inconveniences to the water works, 
without using complex and costly procedures, and without using chemical 
substances and connections to sources of electric energy.- The action of the above mentioned water conditioner suspends all the 
needle-like particles floating in the water which are inevitably transported by it. 
This avoids these particles from gathering together on the surface of 
containers and piping, thus transforming the mineral salts contained in the 
water, from CA (HCO3)2 (calcium hydrate carbonate or bicarbonate), to CO2 + 
H2O + CA CO3 (calcium carbonate, a sub-form of calcite); this avoids the 
formation of calcareous deposits and the consequent partial or total occlusion 
of the pipes and the loosening of the scales which damage, pipes, taps, valves 
and reservoirs. The above mentioned water conditioner, has the following advantages: 
Fitted to pipes, it creates a sole efficient point for the treatment of cold or hot 
water.  
 It protects everything that contains, controls or intercepts water 
   movement against the formation of scales, improving the thermal efficiency of 
the water work. 
In swimming pools and in spas it favours the diffusion of chemical reagents, 
improving their bacteriological efficiency. 
In water boilers and home appliances, it avoids the formation of scales, 
and the use of detergents for their periodical cleaning. It is easily assembled because it is composed of a few simple parts which are 
easy to use and to put together. 
It is easily fitted to machines and water works. 
It can be placed next to equipment which does not tolerate the proximity 
of magnets, since it doesn't cause any difficult situations. It has been created to obtain relevant results regarding the water to be treated 
at high degrees of
