<ABSTRACT>
The artificial acetabular cup according to the invention comprises an outer shell (1) composed of several, relatively rigid outer shell segments (1a, 1c) which are mutually connected via resilient regions. The outer shell (1) thus has areas of high dimensional stability resiliently connected to one another. The outer shell segment (1) in the region of the principal loading direction (F) is designed as an anchorage region (1a) and has passage openings for bone screws, as well as a guidance and fastening hole (3) for an inner shell (10). The guidance hole (3) is arranged on the pole (P2) with respect to the entire outer shell (1). In the region of the principal loading direction (F), the outer shell (1), that is to say the anchorage region (1a) rests positively on the inner shell (10), whereas the remaining outer shell segments (1c) have a gap (D) to the inner shell (10), so that as a result of the bell-like suspension of the inner shell (10) on the pole (P2) it is movable, in particular perpendicular to the axis (18), shock-absorbing elements (13a) of the inner shell (10) transmitting, in particular, intermittent forces in a shock-absorbed manner onto the outer shell (1).

<CLAIMS>
An artificial acetubular cup comprising of a metallic outer
shell (1) having anchorage aids (6,8a,8b) and an inner shell (10)

to incorporate a ball-joint head, whereby inner shell (10) has
an annular-shaped damping element (13) on its outer surface in

the circumferential direction and has a centring pin (12) on its
pole (P1), and where outer shell (1) has a guide (3), concentric

to the rotation symmetry axis, for incorporating the centring pin
(12), characterised in that outer shell (1) has an anchorage area

(1a), likewise spring areas (1d) in the circumferential
direction, having a small wall thickness (d), alternating with

outer shell segments (1b,1c,1e) of greater wall thickness (D),
that anchorage area (1a) has anchorage aids (6,8a,8b) likewise

the guide (3), and that outer shell (1) has a gap (2) on the side
opposite the anchorage area (1a) opening to the equator, which

extends along a meridian circle (9) through pole (P2).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that inner
shell (10) is comprised of metal.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that inner
shell (10) is comprised of synthetic material.
A device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
damping element (13) is comprised of polyethylene.
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
damping element (13) is a component of inner shell (10), in which

the outer surface of inner shell (10) close to the equator is
recessed in the circumferential direction, and thereby has a

springy lip (13a). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that anchorage area (1a) of outer shell (1) is in extensive

contact with inner shell (10) in the assembled, non-loaded state,
against which a clearance (32) is present between outer shell

segments (1b,1c,1e) and inner shell (10) with the exception of

damping element (13).
A device according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that damping element (13) is radially supported on a recess of

outer shell (1), and thus forms a snap fastening.
A device according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that at least two outer shell segments (1b,1c) have anchorage

aids (8c,8d).
A device according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that outer shell (1) has a plurality of gaps (2,2b,2c,2d) and

that a re-absorbable body (40,41) is insertable in at least one
gap (2,2b,2c,2d), so as to lend an increased primary stability

to outer shell (1).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the reabsorbable
bodies (40,41) are comprised of polylactate.
