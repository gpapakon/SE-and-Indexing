<ABSTRACT>
Modified chimaeric antibodies, and antibody heavy and light 
chains, which comprise variable domains derived from a first 

mammalian species, usually mouse, and constant domains from a 
second mammalian species, usually human. Modification concerns 

the variable domains, in particular the framework regions of the 
variable domains. The modifications are made only in T-cell 

antigenic structures present in framework regions, and do not 
cover canonical structures or Vernier zone. The modifications 

adapt the amino acid sequences concerned to those occurring in 
corresponding antibodies derived from said second mammalian 

species. Thus, the modified chimaeric antibodies retain the 
original antigen recognition and binding properties but become 

less immunogenic to said second mammalian species, which 
improves their therapeutical utility with said second mammalian 

species. Recombinant DNA technology may be used to construct and 
produce the modified chimaeric antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the field of 
immunology, in particular to a method for obtaining modified 
immunoglobulins with reduced immunogenicity of murine antibody 
variable domains and compositions containing them. The immune system builds antibodies that bind to a vast 
range of antigens with high avidity and specificity, and trigger 
effector mechanisms. Antibodies have been used in medicine as 
diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and their potential has been 
successively enhanced with the advent of new technologies. Hybridoma technology allowed isolation of cell lines 
secreting antibodies of a single specificity (KÃ¶hler G., 
Milstein C. (1975) Nature (London) 256, 495-497), and gene 
technology has allowed the construction of a range of engineered 
antibodies from hybridomas. Engineering of antibodies is facilitated by their domain 
structure and may further improve the utility of many antibodies 
by the acquisition or loss of some of their properties. The 
antigen-binding properties of the antibody provide the recognition 
function and this can be attached to one or more of a 
number of effector agents. The combination of these two features 
must then be tested against the criteria of efficacy, 
specificity and immunogenicity. Monoclonal antibody producing hybridomas have been most 
readily obtained from immunized rodents. At present the use of 
several murine monoclonal antibodies has been widespreaded for 
the imaging and treatment of malignancy, prophylactic administration 
to guard against toxic shock, modification of graft 
rejection episodes, and to temper acute inflammatory reactions.  
 In most of the cases where rodent antibodies have been used 
for therapy, the recipients have elicited an immune response 
directed towards the antibody. These reactions have limited the 
duration and effectiveness of the therapy. Development of similar reagents from human sources has been 
frustated, although several options exist, using for example 
SCID-hu mice, in vitro immunization, recombinatorial libraries, 
or some useful combination of these. Because there are many 
well-characterized rodent monoclonal antibodies already 
available which might be used in the clinic if the immune 
response could be abolished, the production of engineered 
antibodies has received much attention. Engineered antibodies have been designed to replace as much 
as possible of the xenogeneic sequences with the equivalent 
human sequence. Among the genetically engineered antibodies are 
chimaeric antibodies in

<CLAIMS>
A method of modifying an antibody comprising: 

comparing the framework amino acids of a variable domain of a first 
mammalian species with the framework amino acids of variable domains of a 

second mammalian species; 
determining a subgroup of the second mammalian species to which the 
first mammalian species most closely corresponds; 
selecting an antibody from said subgroup whose framework sequence is 
most similar to the first mammalian species' framework sequence; 
identifying amino acid residues of the first mammalian species which 
differ from the amino acid residues of the selected second mammalian species 

framework and which are within T-cell antigenic sequences in the variable 
region of the selected antibody; 
selecting the amino acid residues that are not within complementarity 
determining regions and are not directly involved with canonical structures or 

Vernier zone; 
replacing the amino acid residues in the first mammalian species 
framework which differ from the amino acid residues of the second mammalian 

species with the corresponding amino acid residues from the most similar 
second mammalian species thus identified; and 
obtaining the modified antibody.
