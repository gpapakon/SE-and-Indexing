<ABSTRACT>
Load handling apparatus including load handling means provided for picking up a load (21) from a supply location therefor (A), and for subsequently off-loading the load at an off-loading location (C) is used for handling/supporting the load (21) throughout any load transfer between said locations (A, C) and at least one activity location (B) at which at least one predetermined operation/process activity may be required to be performed on the load (21); and for supporting said load whilst any such operation/process activity location. When the load is a circular saw blade the blade is carried by a mandrel (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOAD HANDLINGThis invention relates to the handling of loads.In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention is concerned with the handling of loads in situations in which a plurality of elements, in particular similar elements, are required to be successively positioned at a work station for the purposes of carrying out some operation/process on the elements and then to be transfered, after such operation/process has been carried out, to a receiving position in which elements can be subsequently handled as required. For example, stacked until a predetermined number has beeen assembled.There are many forms of apparatus for the handling of loads .However, with such known apparatus there is conventionally involved several load transfer stages in which the elements are transfered from support arrangements provided for moving the elements from a first position to a work/process station at which they are transfered to further means for supporting the elements whilst they are at the work/process station and then to transfer the elements from such further means to still further transfer arrangements serving to transport the elements away from the work/process station to, for example, a storage position.It will be appreciated that in relation to present day industrial activities it is invariably desirable to reduce as far as possible the times involved in the working/processing or the like of workpieces. Since the 

 total work time involvement in relation to the processing of a workpiece obviously includes transfer times to and from a work/process station including the transfer to arrangements for supporting an element whilst at the work/process station it is of interest to eliminate wherever possible handling operations.Broadly, according to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a load handling apparatus characterised by means adapted to pickup/en rain an article/element•^Q from a supply thereof, to transport the article/element to a position at which it is to be subjected to some operation/process, to support the ar icle/element whilst being subjected to a said operation/process, and also to transfer the article/element from said position to a1 location at which it is required to place/deposit the processed/worked upon articles/elements.In accordance with a further aspect of the invention in a pick and place load handling apparatus the means provided for picking up a 3oad, and subsequently placing the load 20 is/are the same as the means used for handling/supporting the load whilst any

CLAIMS
1. Load handling apparatus characterised in that load handling means (1,6,28,29) provided for picking up a load
(21) from a supply location (A,22) therefor, and for subsequently off-loading the load at an off-loading location (C,23) is used for handling/supporting the load throughout any load transfer between said locations (A,C) and at least one activity location (B) at which at least one predetermined operation/process activity may be required to be performed on the load (21); and for supporting said load (21) whilst at any such operation/process activity location.
2. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 1, and characterised in that the load handling means (1,6,28,29) is adapted to pickup/entrain a load (21) from said supply
(22) when the latter is at a predetermined supply location (A), to transport the load to a said activity location (B), to support the load whilst it is being subjected to a said activity, to support the load during any transfer operation on the load from the activity location to a location (C) at which it is required to off-load the load, and to off-load said load at said off-loading location.
3. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 2, and characterised in that the supply location (A) and the off-loading location (C) are separate one from the other.

4. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or 3, and charac erised by means ( 22A.23A 24) for enabling selective setting of the operational positions of the supply location and said off-loading location relative to any said activity location.
5. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 4, and characterised in that the means for enabling selective setting of the operational positions of said supply and off-loading locations (A,C) allows relative positional adjustment of said locations according to the physical size and form of the load (21) and the nature of any said activity to be carried out on the load.
6. Load handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, and characterised in that the means for defining the positions of said locations includes a guide arrangement for enabling the locations to be selectively established relative to a predetermined path.
7. Load handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, and characterised in that the load handling means includes a pivotally mounted arm (1) adapted at one end (5) to mount load pick-up and delivery means (28,29), and means (9,10,11) for enabling the load pick-up and delivery means to be selectively positioned at said locations according to a preselectable sequence.
8. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 7, and characterised in that the selective positioning positioning of the pick-up and delivery means at said locations by means of the pivotal movements of the arm (1) are arranged to be controlled in response to control signals arising from position sensors (45,45A).

9. Load handling apparatus as claimed in 7 or 8, and characterised in that when the load comprises magnetisable material the pick-up and delivery means is adapted magnetically to cooperate with the magnetisable load.
10. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 9, whereing electromagnetic means (36,46) are provided upon a support member (37) carried by the load-pick-up and delivery means, and in that the support member (37) is arranged to be displaceable relative to said guide path (24) in such manner that in a first position the electromagetic means (36,46) is able to remove a load from the supply and entrain the load with the handling arm (1) and in a second position to off-load the load when the handling means is cooperating with the off loading location (C).
11. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 10, and characterised in that means (49,48,) are provided for so controlling the electromagnetic means whilst the load is a a said activity location (B) that the load can be positionally adjusted in accordance with position adjustment demands for the load when at a said activity location.
12. Load handling apparatus as claimed in when the pivotal displacements of the load supporting arm (1) are arranged to be under the control of a hydraulic control system (10) . 


 13. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim any preceding and charaterised in that when the load (21) is formed by a circular saw blade whose teeth are required to be provided with hard material tips the load handling ; means includes a mandrel (29) for mounting the blade thereto and further mandrels (22,23) at said loading and off-loading locations.
14. Load handling apparatus as claimed in claim 13, and characterised in that the mandrels (22,23) at the loading and off-loading locations (A,C) are horizontally arranged, and in that the mandrel (29) associated with the load handling means is operationally horizontal.
15. Load handing apparatus as claimed in claim 14, and characterised in that the mandrels (22,23) at the loading and off-loading locations are vertically arranged, and in that the load handing means (28,29) is adapted for positioning its mandrel (29) so that it is axially horizontal when at an activity location (B) and in a axially vertical direction when at a loading or off-loading location (A,C).
