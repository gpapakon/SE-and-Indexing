<ABSTRACT>
Left eye and right eye images of an autostereoscopic display are 
displayed on LCD spatial light modulators (1a,1b) which are illuminated 

by movable light sources (2a,2b) via converging lenses (3a,3b) or 
mirrors. A tracking system tracks the position of an observer and a 

control system controls the positions of the light sources (2a,2b) so 
that the images of the light sources formed by the lenses (3a,3b) or 

mirrors track the observer. The observer thus sees the 3D image while 
having an enlarged degree of freedom of movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display for three dimensional images.Known display devices for producing three dimensional (3D) images create the illusion
of a 3D opaque object by displaying a number of two dimensional (2D) images to the
observer. Each of the 2D images is a view of the object from a particular direction and,
during reproduction of the 3D image, each component 2D image is replayed in its
respective direction.The freedom of movement of the viewer location is limited by the total angular range
over which the views are imaged. Known displays capable of imaging only a low
number of 2D views provide a 3D image within a highly restricted range of viewing
angles. Consequently the viewer is constrained to be within a limited range of positions
in order to maintain the appearance of a 3D image. Similarly, the number of observers
of a 3D image may also be restricted due to the limited number of 2D views."Subjective Assessments of the Resolution of Viewing Directions in a Multi Viewpoint
3D TV System", S. Pastoor, K. Schenke, p 217 Proc. SID Vol. 30/3 1989 describes the
requirement for the number of views in a 3D display. It is estimated that, for a typical
scene, 60 or more views may be required in an interocular spacing. For a wide field of
view, several hundred views will have to be displayed at some time. It is currently not
possible to achieve this with a simultaneous view presentation type of display.A display described by Akiyama.K, and Tetsutani.N in a paper titled "Three
dimensional visual communication" 1991 ITE Annual convention, p607, has a two view
display produced by providing an interlaced image on a liquid crystal device (LCD)
behind a lenticular screen. The position of an observer is monitored and, as the observer
moves from an orthoscopic viewing zone to a pseudoscopic viewing zone, the sequence
in which the images are interlaced is reversed so as to maintain the appearance of an
orthoscopic image to the observer. Such a system requires precise tracking of the 
observer's head so as to determine the time at which the image sequence should be
reversed. Further, such a display is limited to use by a single observer and the black
mask of the LCD is made visible by the lenticular screen.EP-A-0 404 289 "Television set or the like for creating a three dimensional perception
of images and apparatus for creation of same" describes a 3D display in which a
lenticular screen is moved with respect to a high resolution display device in response to
movement of an observer. Such an apparatus
