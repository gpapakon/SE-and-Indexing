<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive blasting apparatus is provided which 
comprises a blast nozzle (2) arranged in a blast chamber (1) 

for blasting, toward a workpiece (W), two different kinds of 
abrasive particles separately supplied from a first abrasive 

container (5) and a second abrasive container (6). The 
abrasive particles falling to the bottom of the blast chamber 

(1) is collected by an abrasive collector (15), and the 
collected abrasive particles are separated by an 
abrasive 
separating system (11) into those of the first abrasive 

material and those of the second abrasive material. The two 
different portions of the abrasive particles are returned 

separately to the first and second abrasive containers (5, 6) 
through feedback conduits (12, 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an abrasive blasting apparatus
which utilizes a blast of abrasive particles for surface
treatment of a workpiece, for example to finish the inner cavity surfaces
of a die or mould.For simplicity, the term "die" is used in the following
description to mean either one of a die or a mould.An abrasive blasting apparatus utilizes a blast of
abrasive particles entrained in a high-speed air flow, and is
widely used for performing surface treatments (e.g. ground
conditioning and Butler finishing) of, for example, metal workpieces
   or for removing flashes or burrs of formed resin or
metal products. The hardness, grain size and/or other
characteristics of the abrasive particles are suitably selected
depending on the nature of the workpiece and/or the purposes of
the blasting operation.Typically, a suction-type abrasive blasting apparatus
comprises a blast chamber, a blast nozzle arranged in the blast
chamber, and an abrasive container for storing particles of an
abrasive material. The blast nozzle is connected to an
external air source through an air supply hose on the one hand, and
to the abrasive container through an abrasive supply hose on
the other hand. When the air source is actuated to pass a
high-speed air stream through the blast nozzle, the abrasive 
particles gravitationally introduced into the blast nozzle are
drawn in the high-speed air stream for blasting under the
assistance of the suction force generated by the air stream.For improving the quality of surface finishing, it is
often necessary to perform the surface finishing at least in
two successive stages which include rough finishing (primary
finishing) and final fine finishing (secondary finishing).
Relatively hard, coarse abrasive particles are used for the
rough finishing, whereas relatively soft, fine abrasive
particles are used for the final fine finishing.The conventional abrasive blasting apparatus described
above is not suitable for performing such a two-stage surface
treatment. Specifically, since the conventional apparatus
utilizes a single abrasive material, it is necessary to
entirely replace the abrasive material by a new batch of a
different abrasive material for the secondary finishing after
completing the primary finishing. Obviously, such a change of
abrasive materials is very troublesome which results in low process
efficiency. Further, if a portion of the abrasive material for
the primary finishing is unexpectedly left in the system (which
is quite likely) and mixed with the later loaded abrasive
mat
