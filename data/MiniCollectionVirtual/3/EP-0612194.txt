<ABSTRACT>
A speaker system including a speaker unit, a cabinet, 
and a pair of ducts. The cabinet has a baffle plate. The 

speaker unit is mounted to the baffle plate. The pair of 
ducts have parallel axes. Each of the ducts has a first 

end mounted to the baffle plate and a second end disposed 
in the cabinet. The first end of each duct defines an 

outer opening formed in a plane parallel to a surface of 
the baffle plate, and the second end of each duct defines 

an inner opening at least a part of which is formed in a 
plane not parallel to the plane forming the outer opening. 

Each duct has a shape such that a sectional area of each 
duct is gradually reduced from one of the inner and outer 

openings to the other opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speaker system, 
and more particularly to a phase-inverted type of speaker 
system. Widely known is a phase-inverted type of speaker 
system (which will be hereinafter referred to as a 
bass-reflex type of speaker system) having a duct for 
giving a suitable change in phase to sound wave radiated 
from a rear surface of a speaker unit and radiating sound 
wave according in phase with sound wave radiated from a 
front surface of the speaker unit. Such a bass-reflex type of speaker system has a 
structure as shown in Figs. la and 1b, wherein Fig. 1a is a 
front elevation of the speaker system, and Fig. 1b is a 
cross section taken along the line X-X in Fig. la. The 
speaker system includes an enclosure 1, a baffle 
plate 2 forming a front surface of the enclosure 1, a 
speaker 3, and a pair of bass-reflex ducts (which will be 
hereinafter referred to simply as ducts) 4. The 
speaker unit 3 is mounted to the baffle plate 2. Each  
 
duct 4 is cylindrical, and it is integrally formed with 
the baffle plate 2 or is mounted to the baffle plate 2. The phase of sound wave A₂ radiated from the 
rear surface of the speaker unit 3 is opposite to the 
phase of sound wave A₁ radiated from the front surface 
of the speaker unit 3. The sound wave A₂ radiated to an 
inside space 5 of the enclosure 1 is introduced from an 
inner opening 4a of the duct 4 into the duct 4, and is 
then radiated from an outer opening 4b of the duct 4 to 
the front side of the speaker system. The volume of the 
inside space 5, the length of the duct 4, the areas of 
the inner and outer openings 4a and 4b, etc. are set so 
that the phase of the sound wave A₂ to be radiated from 
the outer opening 4b becomes the same as the phase of 
the sound wave A₁. However, the bass-reflex type of speaker 
system as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b has the following 
problems. First, there is a problem in production. As 
the duct is formed usually in a cylindrical or prismatic 
shape, a large space for packaging is required in 
packaging a plurality of such ducts as independent 
parts, thus greatly reducing a transporting efficiency 
and increasing a transporting cost.  That is, as the duct is cylindrical or 
prismatic, a plurality of such ducts cannot be stacked 
together in a telescopic fashion. In the condition 
where the duct is mounted to the baffle plate, a 
plurality of such baffle plates cannot be stacked in 
close relationship to each other. Accordingly, a depth 
corresponding to the total length of the ducts is 
required
