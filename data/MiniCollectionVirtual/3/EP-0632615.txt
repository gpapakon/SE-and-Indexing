<ABSTRACT>
For data security in a pay-TV system, a public key is in each case determined from a secret key which is allocated by the programme provider to the pay-TV receiver and which is used in the programme distribution centre to encrypt secondary-key information in order to adapt the pay-TV receiver to repeatedly modified modes of transmission which are provided in the programme distribution centre for the pay-TV receiver. The programme provider can define new keys from time to time. The initial settings of scramblers and descramblers can be modified as modes of transmission.

<CLAIMS>
Method for data security in a digital
telecommunications system which comprises a central

telecommunications device (CU) and a plurality of local
telecommunications devices (DU), in particular a B-ISDN

telecommunications system, in which the signals are
transmitted from the central telecommunications device

(CE) in the direction of the local devices (DU) by
means of ATM cells, characterized in that, in the case

of pay-TV distribution by means of ATM, a public key
which matches a secret key specified for a pay-TV

receiver (DU) is used in the programme distribution
centre (CU) to encrypt secondary-key information in

order to match the pay-TV receiver (DU) to transmission
modalities which change repeatedly and are provided in

the programme distribution centre (CU) for the pay-TV
receiver (DU).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the initial position and/or the structure of a

scrambler (Scr) which is provided in the programme
distribution centre (CU) and of a de-scrambler (Descr)

which is provided in the pay-TV receiver (DU) are/is
changed repeatedly at the start of the frame, in that

the programme distribution centre (CU) in each case
uses a random number generator to determine a random

new initial position and/or structure for the scrambler
(Scr), and reports the associated initial position

and/or structure of the de-scrambler (Descr) in
encrypted form to the relevant pay-TV receiver (DU) 

using a public key which matches the secret key which
is specified for the respective pay-TV receiver (DU),

which pay-TV receiver (DU) decrypts this message using
the associated secret key, after which the change is

carried out starting from a specific pulse frame.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the transmission modalities are changed at

different times for different pay-TV receivers (DU) or
groups of pay-TV receivers (DU).
