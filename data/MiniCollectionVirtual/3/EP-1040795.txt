<ABSTRACT>
A bifurcated stent for insertion into a bifurcated
vessel such as a blood vessel. In one embodiment, a first sheet

is formed into a first leg, a second sheet is formed into a
second leg, a third sheet is formed into a stem, and the two legs

are attached to the stem. In a second embodiment, a first sheet
is formed into a member having a first leg and half of a stem, a

second sheet is formed into a second member having a second leg
and half of a stem, and the two stem halves are combined to form

the bifurcated stent. In a third embodiment, the stent comprises
two sections that are serially inserted and assembled within the

vessel at the site of the bifurcation to be treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stents, and more particularly to bifurcated stents
and methods of making bifurcated stents for insertion within a branching vessel.Stents are well known in the art. They are typically formed of a cylindrical metal
mesh which can expand when pressure is internally applied. Alternatively, they
can be formed of wire wrapped into a cylindrical shape or sheets of material
formed into a cylindrical shape.Stents are devices which are usually implanted within bodily conduits including
the vascular system to reinforce collapsing, partially occluded, weakened, or abnormally
dilated sections of the blood vessel. Stents also have been successfully
implanted in other areas, e.g., the urinary tract or the bile duct to reinforce such
bodily conduits.U.S. Patent No. 4,994,071 (MacGregor) discloses an expandable, bifurcating stent
having a main cylindrical lattice formed from interconnected, flexible loops. Two additional
cylindrical lattices, having smaller diameters than the main lattice, are
similarly constructed. The main lattice includes a flexible wire interconnecting the
main lattice to one of the additional lattices. A second flexible wire interconnects
the main lattice to the other additional lattice. The flexible wires form backbones
that extend axially along the length of the main lattice and along each of the additional
lattices. One disadvantage of this bifurcating stent is the complex nature of 
the interconnection of the flexible wires forming the backbones within the loop
structure of each lattice.EP-A-0 551 179 discloses a bilateral intra-aortic bypass graft including two tubular
grafts which are intraluminally delivered to the aorta and secured to the aorta
by the expansion and deformation of two expandable and deformable tubular
members.WO-A-9 521 592 discloses a bifurcated stent
comprising two legs connected to a stem portion.The invention is as
defined in the appended set of claims.
According to the invention, the bifurcated stent is formed by preparing two stent
sheets. For each sheet, the longitudinal edges of a portion of the sheet are turned
up and secured to each other to form one of the two leg portions of the bifurcated
stent. The remaining free edges of each of the two sheets are then joined to form
the stem portion of the stent.FIG. 1shows a bifurcated stent

A method of making a bifurcated stent (50, 250) comprising two legs connected to a

single-lumen stem portion, comprising the steps of:

a) preparing a first sheet (70, 270), having a proximal end
and a distal end;
b) deforming said distal end of said first sheet (70, 270) to
form a first leg (55, 255) and deforming said proximal end

of said first sheet to form a first stem half (65',
265');
c) preparing a second sheet (75, 275) having a proximal end
and a distal end;
d) deforming said distal end of said second sheet (75, 275)
to form a second leg (60, 260) and deforming said proximal end

of said second sheet to form a second stem half (65",
265"); and
e) joining said first stem half (65', 265') to said second stem half
(65", 265"), thereby obtaining said single-lumen stem portion (65, 265).
