<ABSTRACT>
An input auxiliary transmission system is disclosed for a compound 
transmission (15) comprising an auxiliary transmission section (17) in series with a 

change gear mechanical main transmission section 19. The auxiliary section 
includes an input splitter (41) including first (53,47) and second (53,49) jaw 

clutches. When each of the jaw clutches is disengaged, the splitter is in a third 
position in which the input shaft (13) is disengaged from the auxiliary section 

output gear (45). The invention provides a fluid pressure actuator (61) having a 
third position operable to move the jaw clutch to the disengaged condition. The 

transmission includes means (121) to sense the shift mechanism (21) of the main 
section being in a neutral condition, and valve means (89) which communicates 

pressurized fluid to the actuator (61) to move it to its third position, thus 
eliminating a major portion of the inertia as the main transmission section 19 

passes through neutral prior to making a gear shift. As a result, it is possible for 
the synchronizers in the main section to be much smaller and less expensive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to British Application Serial No. 9312014.5, filed 
June 10, 1993. The present invention relates to a compound change-gear vehicular 
transmission having an input auxiliary section of the splitter type, preferably 
connected in series with a mechanical main transmission section, preferably of the 
synchronized type. In particular, the present invention relates to such a 
transmission having an input auxiliary section including a splitter section utilizing 
selectively engageable and disengageable jaw clutches, and will be described in 
connection therewith. Compound mechanical transmissions of the input splitter type, and 
compound transmissions utilizing input auxiliary sections having clutch devices are 
known in the art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 2,886,982; 
3,741,035; and 4,485,692, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Automatic and semi-automatic transmissions and clutch controls therefore 
are known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,081,065; 4,361,060; and 4,648,290, the disclosures of which are incorporated 
herein by reference. Synchronized mechanical change-gear transmissions and transmission 
sections are also well known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,018,319; 4,373,403; and 4,432,251, the disclosures of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. In compound mechanical change-gear transmissions of the type having an 
input auxiliary section and a change-gear mechanical main transmission section, it 
has become common practice to provide the main transmission section with  
 
synchronizers, in accordance with the teachings of the above-incorporated 
references. In synchronized main transmission sections for relatively heavy-duty 
commercial truck applications, the synchronizers are subjected to high inertia 
loads, resulting primarily from the size of the gear train components in the main 
transmission section, and also the size of the fly wheel in the main engine clutch. As a result of such high inertia loads, relatively larger and more expensive 
synchronizers are required, in order for the transmission to achieve the desired level 
of life, and reliability. Unfortunately, larger, heavier synchronizers in turn require 
something such as a power assist in order to reduce operator effort and fatigue, 
thus adding further complication and expense to the synchronizer system. U.S. Patent No. 4,882,951, which is assigned to the assignee of the
