<ABSTRACT>
A sliding block (11) with adjustable track positioning comprising a 
prismatic body, in one face of which there is a longitudinal 

recess (12) arranged to receive a rail (13) by way of rolling elements 
(16) positionable in respective tracks (14,14'), the body being 

essentially of 
C-shaped cross-section consisting of a central part (17) from which two 

flanges extend, wherein in at least one of the two flanges of the 
C-shaped cross-section there is provided a second longitudinal 

recess (18) which divides it into separate portions (19,20) 
connected together 

at the central part (17), the second recess (18) containing elements 
(21) for 

adjusting the distance between the two separate portions (19,20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sliding block with adjustable track
positioning.Linear sliding guide units generally comprise two main constituent
elements, namely an inner element and an outer element slidable
relative to each other by way of rolling elements. The inner
element is of prismatic shape whereas the outer element is of C-shape,
the recess of which carries the inner element. The former
is usually known as the rail while the latter is known as the
sliding block.A required basic characteristic of the sliding block is that its
rolling tracks for the rolling elements be of adjustable distance
apart. This adjustment has two main purposes, namely to adapt the
distance between the tracks to the type and size of the rolling
element used, and to enable the user to directly adjust the
loading or the slack.In this respect in sliding blocks formed by extrusion, as the
distance between the tracks can vary within a range of a few
tenths of a millimetre as allowable tolerance in accordance with
the relevant standards, the exact distance must be able to be
reset. In addition the user must be able to choose the most 
suitable slack or preload condition for his specific requirements.In known linear sliding units this is not always possible or is
inherently difficult because of their structure.GB-A-2 109 479 discloses a sliding block in a linear
bearing unit according to the preamble of claim 1.The object of the present invention is to provide a sliding block
in which the distance apart of the rolling element tracks can be
adjusted in order to be able to use the prechosen best operating
condition.This object is attained according to the present invention by a
sliding block according to claim 1.The characteristics and advantages of a sliding block according to
the present invention will be more apparent from the description
given hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with reference to
the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a partly sectional elevation of a linear sliding unit
using a sliding block with adjustable track positioning according
to the present invention;Figure 2 is a partly sectional top plan view of the sliding block 
shown in Figure 1;With general reference to Figure 1, this represents an elevational
view of a linear sliding unit using a sliding block with
adjustable track positioning according to the present invention.
The figure shows specifically a sliding block, indicated overall
by 11, within a recess 12 of which there is located a rail 13.

<CLAIMS>
A sliding block with adjustable track positioning
comprising a prismatic body, in one face of which there

is a longitudinal recess (12) arranged to receive a rail
(13) by way of rolling elements (16) positionable in

respective tracks (14, 141, 15), said body being
essentially of C-shaped cross-section consisting of a

central part (17) from which two flanges extend, whereby
in at least one of said flanges of said C-shaped cross-section

there is provided a second longitudunal recess
(18) which divides it into separate portions (19, 20)

connected together at said central part (17), said
second recess (18) containing elements (21) for

adjusting the distance between said two separate
portions (19, 20), wherein said adjustment elements (21)

consist of screws (28) arranged transversely to said two
separate portions (19, 20) and acting to bring said two

portions (19, 20) further apart or closer together,
characterised in that said screws (28) pass through a

seat (29) provided in a first (19) of said two portions
(19, 20) and are screwed into a threaded second seat

(30) in the other (20) of said two portions (19, 20),
said adjustment elements (21) further comprising a

longitudinal eccentric shaft (24) inserted within a
relative profiled housing (25) provided in facing 

surfaces of said two portions (19, 20) and interacting
with said transversely arranged screws (28).
A sliding block as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that that one (20) of said two separate portions (19,

20) facing said first recess (12) is connected to said
central part (17) by a reduced section (22).
A sliding block as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said second recess (18) has a cross-section in

the form of an open L with its lower end facing said
first recess (12).
A sliding block as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said shaft (24) is provided with recesses (27)

for receiving said screws (28).
A sliding block as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said rolling elements (16) are balls.
A sliding block as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said rolling elements are rollers.
