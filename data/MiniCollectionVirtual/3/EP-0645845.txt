<ABSTRACT>
Device for coupling electric components in supporting 
frames including, on two oppositely arranged edges of a 

supporting frame (1), a flexible tooth (4) that can engage 
a complementary tooth (5) correspondingly formed on 

oppositely arranged edges of the casing (3) of an electric 
component in order to apply a retaining action along a 

direction that is substantially at right angles to the 
plane of arrangement of the supporting frame (1). The 

particularity of the invention resides in that it 
comprises, on the casing (3) of the electric component, 

engagement means (10) that can be coupled in guiding means 
(11) which are formed on the frame (1) and are suitable to 

apply a retaining action along a direction that is 
substantially parallel to the plane of arrangement of the 

frame (1) and is substantially perpendicular to the 
oppositely arranged edges of the supporting frame (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for coupling
electric components in supporting frames.As is known, frames for supporting electric components
such as switches, outlets, indication devices and so forth
are currently commercially available and are manufactured in
different lengths according to the number of components they
support.The frames normally have a flexible tooth on their
transverse side; said tooth couples in a snap-together
manner with a complementary tooth which is provided on the
oppositely located edges of the casing of the electric
component. Coupling is normally achieved by inserting the
electric component from the rear face of the frame.In the case of frames having relatively large
dimensions, i.e. frames preset for three or more components,
during the insertion of said components the transverse sides
on which the elastic tooth is provided may splay, thus
making component retention unreliable.Likewise, under stress, if the components are subjected
to pressure they may disengage from the frame due to the
splaying of the sides, i.e. due to the mutual spacing of the
transverse sides, which allows the disengagement of the
tooth from the complementary tooth.US-A-4 046 449 discloses a system for interchangeable
attachment of electrical equipment, as described above, and
which is affected by the above-mentioned drawbacks.A principal aim of the invention is indeed to solve
the above described problem by providing a device for 
coupling electric components in supporting frames which
allows to create a stiffening element that prevents the
mutual spacing of the transverse sides, without thereby
entailing cross-members or similar elements that join the
transverse sides, since such cross-members would prevent the
various components from being arranged mutually adjacent.Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of
the invention is to provide a coupling device which in
addition to making the frame stable is also capable of
facilitating and guiding the insertion of the various
components.Another object of the-present invention is to provide a
device which, by virtue of its particular constructive
characteristics, is capable of giving the greatest
assurances of reliability and safety in use.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
device which, despite having improved characteristics, does
not create additional complications during manufacture and
does not change the conventional method for applying
electric components.This aim, these objects and others which will become
