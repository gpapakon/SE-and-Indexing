<ABSTRACT>
A wall (1), in particular a containment wall (1) for a nuclear plant, a pool or cavern, has at least one sealing element (4) that covers at least one surface of the bearing wall (2). A protecting wall (5) covers the sealing element (4) and is frictionally connected to the bearing wall (5). The protecting wall (5) may be composed of several parts (5a to 5f). The frictional connection may be ensured by anchors (6, 8), by pre-stressing means or by bonding.

Wall (1), in particular a wall (1) of a 
containment for a nuclear plant, of a pool or of a 

cavern, characterised by a supporting wall (2), a 
sealing element (4) which is arranged so as to cover at 

least one surface of the supporting wall (2), a 
protective wall (5) which is arranged so as to cover 

the sealing element (4), and a frictional connection of 
the protective wall (5) to the supporting wall (2). 
Wall (1) according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the supporting wall (2) and/or the protective 

wall (5) are/is pretensioned and as a result the 
supporting wall (2) is frictionally connected to the 

protective wall (5). 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 or 
2, characterised in that the protective wall (5) is 

frictionally connected to the supporting wall (2) by 
means of anchors (6, 8) which penetrate the sealing 

element (4), and in that the sealing element (4) is 
connected to the anchors (6, 8) in a gas-tight and/or 

liquid-tight manner. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the sealing element (4) is 

frictionally connected to the supporting wall (2) 
and/or the protective wall (5) is frictionally 

connected to the sealing element (4) by means of at 
least one bonding connection. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the protective wall (5) 

consists of a plurality of parts (5a to 5f). 
Wall (1) according to claim 5, characterised 
in that each part (5a to 5f) is frictionally connected 

to the supporting wall (2) by means of anchors (6, 8) 
or by means of a bonding connection. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 5 or 
6, characterised in that the parts (5a to 5f)  

 
communicate with each other by means of clamping 

elements, whereby the parts (5a to 5f) are frictionally 
connected to the supporting wall (2). 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 5 to 
7, characterised in that arranged on the protective 

wall (5) there is a supporting framework (7, 8) by 
means of which the parts (5a to 5f) are frictionally 

connected to the supporting wall (2). 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 5 to 
8, characterised in that the parts (5a to 5d) are 

arranged so as to leave joints free between them. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the sealing element (4) is or 

contains a layer which consists of a material which is 
elastic and/or plastic and/or the viscosity of which 

increases in the case of a rise in temperature. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that the sealing element (4) is or 

contains a resistant layer, in particular a layer of a 
glass fibre-reinforced or carbon fibre-reinforced or 

metal fibre-reinforced plastics laminate. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
11, characterised in that the protective wall (5) is 

heat-resistant and/or radiation-resistant and/or 
impact-resistant and/or impact-attenuating and/or 

corrosion-resistant. 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 5 to 
12, characterised in that holding supports (7) are 

frictionally connected to the supporting wall (2) by 
means of anchors (8) and in that the parts (5e, 5f) of 

the protective wall (5) are held by means of the 
holding supports (7). 
Wall (1) according to claim 13, characterised 
in tha
t the holding supports (7) are double T-shaped 
and respectively accommodate two adjacent parts (5e, 

5f) and in that a respective leg of the holding  
 

supports (7) is frictionally connected to the 
supporting wall (2) by means of at least one anchor 

(8). 
Wall (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 
14, characterised in that the sealing element (4) has 

at least one cavity which can be monitored for 
penetrating substances.
