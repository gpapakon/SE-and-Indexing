<ABSTRACT>
A device is indicated which operates with active units for line-based digital data transmission between a telecommunications network exchange and subscribers connected to said exchange. At least one cable distributor operating with active electrical components is connected to the exchange via at least one line containing optical and/or electrical transmission elements. At least two terminal distributors operating with active electrical components are connected to the cable distributor in each case via at least one line containing optical and/or electrical transmission elements. At least one subscriber is connected via an electrical line to the terminal distributors in each case installed in physical proximity to a subscriber.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the transmission by wire of digital
communications between a switching centre (VST) of a

telecommunications network and the subscribers (Tln)
connected to same in which the messages are transmitted

between the communications centre (VST) and at least two
terminal blocks (EVZ) operating with active electrical

components as signals in transmission channels over lines
(L1, L2) comprising at least optical transmission elements

and in which, in each case, at least one subscriber (Tln)
is connected by an electrical line (L3) with a terminal

block (EVZ) 
characterised in that:
at the switching centre (VST) at least one cable
terminal (KVZ) operating with active electrical

components is connected by way of a line (L1)
containing at least one optical and/or electrical

transmission element, to which the terminal block
(EVZ) is connected by means of a line (L2) containing

at least one optical and/or electrical transmission
element,
that the active electrical components in the cable
branch box (KVZ) and in the terminal blocks (EVZ) are

adapted to separate the transmission channels in one
direction and to combine them in the other direction

and
that both in the cable branch box (KVZ) and/or in the
switching centre (VST) as well as in the terminal

blocks (EVZ) a channel allocator (KK, KE) is provided
which is adapted to combine the number of

transmission channels for each subscriber (Tln) and
to separate the transmission channels to the 

subscribers (Tln) and to combine them in the reverse
direction.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1 
characterised in
that
 an electrical line (L4) from a terminal (EVZ) to at
least one subscriber (Tln) leads to a transfer point (P)

from which a bus (B) leads to which a subscriber's (Tln)
various equipment can be connected in parallel with the

insertion of service units (SU) adapted to provide
interface signals for each item of equipment.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 2 
characterised in
that
 a four line wire is used for the electrical line (L4)
between a terminal block (EVZ) and the transfer point (P).
Arrangement in accordance with claims 1 - 3 
characterised
in that
 a power supply (SV) is arranged in the cable
branch box (KVZ) which is employed to supply its own

equipment as well as simultaneously to supply the
equipment of the terminal (EVZ) and at least the

subscribers (Tln) telephone (TEL), where between the cable
branch box (KVZ) and the terminal block (EVZ) a line (L2)

is employed which has at least one pair of electrical
conductors.
Method for the digital transmission of messages with an
arrangement as in one of the claims 1 - 4 
characterised in
that
the signal between the switching centre (VST) and
cable branch box (KVZ) is transmitted at a

transmission rate in the range of 100Mbit/s,
preferably at 140Mbits/s or 155Mbit/s, 
the signals between the cable branch box (KVZ) and
the terminal block (EVZ) are transmitted at a

transfer rate of about 10Mbit/s and
that each subscriber (Tln) connected by way of
electrical lines (L3, L4) with a terminal block (EVZ)

has available a transfer rate of at least 2 Mbit/s.
Method in accordance with claim 5 
characterised in that

the channel allocator (KK, KE) provided in the cable
branch box (KVZ) and in the terminal block (EVZ) is

controlled from the switching centre (VST).
