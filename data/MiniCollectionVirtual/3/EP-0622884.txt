<CLAIMS>
Device for detecting and transmitting data and/or
addresses via an installation bus, a standardized n-fold

binary input device (3) known per se serving for data
input and/or address input, switching states of n potential-free

contacts (31-34) being interrogated by the
input device (3) and interpreted as data and/or

addresses, characterized in that a data source (11) is
provided which encodes data and/or addresses with a

number m of possible different values with a bit number
matched to the input device (3) and provides them to the

input device in the form of switching states of n potential-free
contacts, the condition m
>
n
>
=4 being valid, and
the input device (3) having a modified software which

interprets the detected contact points as binary coded
data and/or addresses.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the binary input device (3) contains an evaluation

device (37) and a bus coupling device (38) with a
programmable processor, and in that these device components

(37, 38) are set up for detecting the data or
addresses and for controlling terminals (5), connected to

bus lines (4) of the bus system, as a function of such
detected information.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that apart from at least one binary input device (3) and

terminals (5), there is connected to bus lines (4) of the
installation bus system a measured value controller (8)

which is set up for evaluating measured values which are
detected by the binary input device (3) and are transmitted

via the bus lines (4), and which is set up for 
controlling the terminals (5) as a function of the result

of the evaluation.
