<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a liquid crystal display device for use in 
computers, word processors, liquid crystal television receivers, and so forth, and 
more particularly to its backlight structure. A light conductive panel system described in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication Nos. 3-190004 and 3-203304 is known as one that may be used 
with liquid crystal display devices. This system, however, does not use a light 
transmissive film having a flat surface on one of its surfaces and a parallel 
prismatic surface on the other and said system uses a diffuse film. Therefore, the 
system has a problem in that its lighting power is not sufficient when it is used as 
a backlight for a color liquid crystal. A display device shown in Figure 2 is 
known as a device that solves this problem. This display device uses a light 
conductive panel 1, a diffuse film 2. a light transmissive film 3 having a flat 
surface on one of its surfaces and a parallel prismatic surface on the other, and a 
liquid crystal panel 4, laminated in this order. Though this device can increase the 
brightness of a display panel, it has a problem in that grooves of the prism and 
transparent electrodes of the liquid crystal display panel interfere with one another 
and the interference fringe of a moir√© can be seen. To solve this problem, it may be possible to use a display device 
obtained by stacking a light conductive panel 1, a diffuse film 2, a light 
transmissive film 3 having a substantially flat surface on one of its surfaces and 
a parallel prismatic surface on the other, a diffuse film 6 and a liquid crystal panel 
4 in this order, as shown in Figure 3. Such a device is disclosed by 
"IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin", vol. 33, No. 9, February 1991. 
However, one can easily anticipate the 
drawbacks in this device, i.e., the number of components increases and brightness 
drops.  
 It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a liquid 
crystal display device having a high degree of brightness and that is free from the 
occurrence of a moire. The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive 
studies in order to solve the problems described above, and have found that the 
said problems are not present in a display device according to claim 1. Figure 1 is a sectional view showing schematically the section of a 
display device according to the present invention; Figure 2 is a sectional view showing schematically the section of a 
conventional display device; and Figure 3 is a sectional view showing
