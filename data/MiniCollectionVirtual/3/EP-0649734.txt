<ABSTRACT>
A folding and tucker-tacker station operates upon a flat bottom 
end closure of a packaging sleeve, which closure comprises four panels 

(6, 8, 9 and 17) and a minor panel (12) protruding from the outermost 
edge of the panel (8). The station comprises a mounting (30 to 33) 

supporting three jaws (39c, 42 and 43) oscillatable transversely of the 
sleeve axis A for folding inwards the respective panels (8, 9, and 7), 

and a jaw (40) displaceable along, but not transversely of, the axis A 
for folding inwards the panel (6). The jaw (39c) has a recess (39d) for 

receiving the minor panel (12). The jaw (40) is disposed after the jaw 
(39c) along the path of a mandrel (48) transporting the sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for folding-in end
closure portions at an end of a packaging sleeve.Various apparatus and methods of folding-in end closure portions
of packaging sleeves are known from, for example, United States
Patents 3820303; 4337059 and 4524460; British Patent 1292822; German
Patent 687399; Federal German Patent 1952266 and French Patent
7024151.French Patent 7024151 discloses a system for folding inwards a
smaller pair and a larger pair of end closure flaps of a carton. The
system includes a compressed-air piston-and-cylinder device which
advances, along a supporting rod, an encircling yoke having a smaller
pair and a larger pair of arms, the four arms of the yoke being
angularly distributed at 90Â° spacings around the yoke. Mounted
diametrically opposite each other upon a ring axially movable along
the rod against a spring bias is a first pair of spring-biassed, bell-crank
levers, outer free ends of which form a first pair of jaws
oscillatable transversely of the axis of the rod. The larger pair of
arms acts upon inner free ends of the bell-crank levers to swing the
pair of jaws inwards against the spring bias on the levers to fold
inwards the smaller end closure flaps. Mounted diametrically opposite
each other upon a ring fixed onto the rod is a second pair of spring-biassed,
bell-crank levers, outer free ends of which form a second
pair of jaws oscillatable transversely of the rod axis. After the
larger pair of arms has began to act upon the first pair of bell-crank
levers, the smaller pair of arms begins to act upon inner free ends of
the second pair of bell-crank levers to swing the second pair of jaws
inwards against the spring bias on their levers to fold inwards the
larger flaps. Thus, the smaller flaps are folded inwards before the
larger flaps. The spring bias on the ring mounting the first pair of
levers allows the yoke to advance that ring and the first pair of jaws
to remain in their innermost positions while the jaws of the second
pair of jaws continue to move towards each other. This system has the 
disadvantage that the first pair of levers remains in the closure
throughout the folding-in of the larger flaps and is thus unsuitable
for use in a packaging method in which tucking-tacking of outer sub-panels
is required.United States Patent 3820303 discloses a system in which a mandrel
wheel transports carton sleeves anti-clockwise through various
treatment stations. In a folding station, score lines of bottom end
closure panels of the slaves are "broken"

<CLAIMS>
Folding apparatus for folding-in first and second end
closure panels (8,6) arranged opposite to each other at an

end of a packaging sleeve, comprising a jaw (39c)
oscillatable relative to the sleeve, transversely of the

longitudinal axis (A) of the sleeve, for bearing upon the
first panel (8) to fold the same inwards, and bearing means

(40) displaceable, relatively to said sleeve, to bear upon
the second panel (6) to fold the same inwards, characterized

in that a recess (39d) is formed in said jaw (39c) along a
leading edge zone of said jaw (39c) and at least as long as

a relatively short, longitudinally outermost, edge zone of
the first panel (8) for extending transversely of said

longitudinal axis (A) and for receiving said edge zone of
the first panel (8) during folding thereof thereby.
Folding apparatus according to claim 1, and further
comprising mounting means (31-33) and supporting means (30)

displaceable relatively to each other, and camming means
(39b,41) connected between said supporting means (30) and

said mounting means (31-33), connected to said jaw (39c),
and effective to produce the oscillation of said jaw (39c)

upon relative displacement of said supporting means (30) and
said mounting means (31-33).
Folding apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, and further
comprising a mandrel (48) movable along a path for receiving

said sleeve therearound and for carrying said sleeve past
said bearing means (40) while said bearing means (40) bears

on said second panel (6).
A method of folding-in first and second end closure
panels (8,6) arranged opposite to each other at an end of a

packaging sleeve comprising producing relative displacement
between a jaw (39c) and the sleeve transversely of the

longitudinal axis (A) of the sleeve to cause the jaw (39c)
to bear upon the first panel (8) to fold the same inwards,

and producing relative displacement between bearing means
(40) and said sleeve to cause said bearing means (40) to

bear upon the second panel (6) to fold the same inwards,
characterized in that said relative displacement between

said jaw (39c) and said sleeve also causes a relatively 
short, longitudinally outermost, edge zone (12) of the first

panel (8) to be received in a recess (39d) in said jaw
(39c), and said edge zone (12) of the first panel (8)

becomes folded back outwardly relative to the remainder of
the first panel (8).
A method according to claim 4, and further comprising
causing a mandrel (48) to receive said sleeve therearound,

and producing relative movement between said mandrel (48)
and supporting means (30) at a folding station, then causing

said jaw (39c) and said bearing means (40) to bear upon the
first and second panels (8,6) as aforesaid and tuck the

first panel (8) under the second panel (6), and advancing
said mandrel (48) past said bearing means (40), which is

arranged after said jaw (39c) in the direction of advance of
the mandrel (48), while said bearing means (40) presses said

second panel (6) onto said first panel (8).
