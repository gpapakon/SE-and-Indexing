<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vibratory parts-feeder
apparatus and more particularly to a vibratory
parts-feeder apparatus in which noises generated from a
vibratory parts-feeder can be cancelled.Fig. 1 shows a Prior Art vibratory parts-feeder and
it is generally denoted by a reference numeral 1. A
spiral track is formed on the inner surface of a bowl 2.
It is nearly circular in plan view. The bowl 2 is
combined with a base block 3 by plural leaf springs 5
obliquely arranged at regular angular intervals. A
movable core 4 is fixed at the bottom of the bowl 2. It
is facing to an electro-magnet 7 spacing by a gap g. When
an electro-magnetic coil 6 wound on the electro-magnet 7
is energized by alternating current, an alternating
magnetic attracting force is generated between the
movable core 4 and electro-magnet 7. Thus, the bowl 2 is
tortionally vibrated in a well-known manner. The base
block 3 is supported by rubber springs 8 which function
to prevent vibrational force from transmitting to the
ground S. The rubber spring 8 is fixed at the ground S
through a fixing plate 9 by a bolt.A torsional vibratory force generator is composed of
the movable core 4, the electro-magnet 7, the 
electro-magnetic coil 6 and the leaf springs 5. The
whole of the torsional vibratory generator is covered by
a cylindrical cover member 10. The above described
vibratory parts-feeder 1 is widely used to supply
different parts to a next stage in a desired posture.
Recently, small parts such as semi-conductor device and
electronic part are widely handled by the vibratory
parts-feeder 1. The size of the part is, for example,
1mm x 2mm x 0.5mm. It is difficult to obtain a
satisfactory orientating function at the commercial
electric source frequency supply of 50Hz or 60Hz.
Accordingly, a driving frequency of the electric-magnetic
coil is increased to a higher frequency such as 100Hz,
while an amplitude of this bowl is smaller. The small
parts can be sufficiently orientated. However, the level
of the sound generated from the vibratory parts-feeder
driven by the high-frequency is very high and the sound
is jarring. It is a public nuisance to the neighborhood.The problem with which the present invention is
concerned is the noise produced by such a vibratory
parts-feeder apparatus.A sound reducing enclosure for a vibratory feeder is
known from United States Patent 3,960,237. The sound
reducing enclosure includes two semi-cylindrical elements
surrounding the vibratory feeder. Bottom flanges of the
semi-cylindrical elements are bolted to a
