<DESCRIPTION>
 PARATHYROID HORMONE FRAGMENTS AND ANALOGSThis invention relates to parathyroid hormone peptides and their use in treating bone disease. In particular/ this invention relates to human parathyroid hormone peptide fragments and analogs which stimulate bone formation without the undesirable side effects associated with known parathyroid hormone peptides.Degenerative bone disease, such as osteoporosis, is the most frequently occurring disease of the skeletal system. It is characterized by an imbalance in cell biological activity between bone formation and bone resorption which results in a reduction of bone mass. The problems involved ' in treating osteoporosis and conditions of reduced bone mass are largely unresolved. This is especially true in cases where a considerable reduction of bone mass has occurred and remodeling of the bone has decreased, as seen in the late stages of osteoporosis. Successful treatment should not only prevent progression of the disease, but should also stimulate new bone formation. Present treatment of osteoporosis includes hormone therapy, calcium and vitamin D supplements and sodium fluoride treatment, which for the most part are unsatisfactory. Bone loss may be slowed down by such treatment, but the total net gain in bone mass is limited. 

 It has been known for some time that the parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium and phosphorus metabolism and has a potent effect on bone metabolism. Administration of PTH however, induces a rapid proliferation of osteoclast cells associated with bone destruction, as well as a slower stimulation of osteoblast cells, which are necessary for bone formation. It is also well established that the first 34 N-terminal amino acids, (1-34)PTH, of the 84 amino acids, which make up PTH, are responsible for nearly all of the biological activity of the native hormone. Numerous clinical trials and experimental work have shown that both PTH and (1-34JPTH are only of very limited clinical value in treating osteoporosis. This is because of poor, inconsistent and unpredictable total net gain in bone mass, due to their stimulating osteoclastic activity as well as osteoblastic activity. In addition, continued use of PTH or (1-34) PTH induces tachiphylaxis within 12 to 18 months after treatment starts. Removal of the first one or two amino acids is known to reduce the activities of PTH and (1-34) PTH associated with stimulation of osteoclasts and bone resorption in vitro. It has been suggested that the parathyroid hormone fragment (3-34) PTH would
