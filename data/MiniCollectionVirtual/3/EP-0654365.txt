<ABSTRACT>
A low noise tyre having a block type tread pattern 
capable of reducing a running noise. The block 

pattern comprises a pair of axially outermost main 
grooves (2A), at least one axially inner main groove 

(2B), first axial grooves (4A) extending between one 
of the axially outermost main grooves (2A) and the 

adjacent axially inner main groove (2B), and second 
axial grooves (4B) extending between one of the 

axially outermost main grooves (2A) and the adjacent 
tread edge (3). The axially outer ends of the first 

axial grooves (4A) are disconnected from the axially 
outermost main groove (2A) by a shut-off rubber wall 

(8) therebetween, but the axial inner ends of the 
second axial grooves (4B) are connected with the 

axially outermost main grooves (2A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low noise tyre
having an improved block pattern reducing running
noise.In off-the-road cars, tyres having a block type
tread pattern are widely used for their superior
road grip performance.In recent years, as the expressway network is
developed, opportunities for off-the-road cars with
block pattern tyres to run on well-paved expressways
is increasing. Thus it is required to reduce the
running noise from such block pattern tyres since
they generate much noise when running on well-paved
roads at a high speed.As a running noise from a tread pattern, the so
called air pumping noise has been known. During
high speed running, air between the tyre tread and
the ground is compressed. The compressed air is
released, passing through the main grooves (the
circumferentially extending wide grooves) and the
wide axial grooves extending from the main groves to 
the axially outside of the tyre. Accordingly, there
is a high speed air flow from the tread centre
region towards the axially outside thereof. As a
result, this high speed air flow at the time of air
release generates a noise, and the resonance of the
wide axial groove in its longitudinal direction
generates noise. Such noise has a relatively high
frequency range and therefore is uncomfortable.The pumping noise may be reduced if the number,
width and/or depth of the axial grooves are
decreased, but the road grip performance during off-the-road
running especially on-the-snow running is
then greatly deteriorated.EP-A-0 231 448 shows a tyre in which the pumping noise has been
reduced by means of transverse walls in the middle of the axial
grooves.It is therefore, an object of the present invention
to provide a low noise tyre having a block type
tread pattern, in which the running noise during
high-speed running on a well-paved road is reduced
without sacrificing off-the-road performance
especially on-the-snow performance.According to the present invention a
low noise tyre comprises a tread portion provided
with a block type tread pattern, said block type
tread pattern comprising circumferentially extending 
main grooves including a pair of axially outermost
main grooves and at least one axially inner main
groove, and axial grooves (including first axial
grooves extending between one of the axially
outermost main grooves and the adjacent axially
inner main groove and second axial grooves extending
between one of the axially outermost main grooves
and the adjacent tread edge, characterised in that
the axially outer ends of the
