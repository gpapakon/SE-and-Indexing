<ABSTRACT>
For the injection-moulding from thermoplastic material of articles 10 which enclose a hollow space 15 by their walls 13, 14, a process is proposed in which a mould cavity 23, pre-limited in its volume, of a mould 20 is initially fully injected with the polymer melt 31 and then enlarged in its volume and is subjected to a fluidic pressure medium in order that the polymer melt 31 is distributed along and applied to the walls of the enlarged mould cavity volume, thereby forming the hollow space. In order that the desired or required hollow spaces 15 can be moulded in the articles 10 exactly reproducibly, the fluidic pressure medium is injected into the polymer melt 31 completely filling the pre-limited mould cavity volume - if appropriate after the elapse of an interval or rest period following after the polymer melt injection operation - and the volume of the mould cavity 23 is not deliberately enlarged until during or with the injection of the said pressure medium and/or in a manner dependent on this injection of the fluidic pressure medium into the polymer melt 31.
