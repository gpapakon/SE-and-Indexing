openings (3,4) of both chambers, forming there a connecting 
part, the chambers being filled with different materials, 

two sealing steps being provided for the closing process, 
characterised in that the first chamber is filled with the 

first material under aseptic conditions and is closed off by 
means of a first partial seal (51) with a covering sheet 

(6), after which the second chamber is filled with the 
second material and is closed off by means of a second 

partial seal (52), so forming a completely sealed two-chamber 
tub. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that after 
the aseptic filling of the first chamber, this and the still 

empty second chamber are provided simultaneously with a 
covering sheet (6) resting on the edge flange region of the 

tub and, after partial sealing of the filled chamber, the 
area of the covering sheet over the second chamber is opened 

up by lifting of that portion of the covering sheet, the 
chamber is filled and subsequently the lifted portion of 

covering sheet is returned to its starting position and is 
sealed. 
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that during 
sealing of the first chamber the unsealed portion of the 

covering sheet is placed on the edge flange area of the 
second chamber opening and in that after the unsealed 

covering sheet portion has been tilted in the direction of 
the first covering sheet portion and into the open position 

along a sealing edge formed when the first chamber is sealed 
and tilted back into place and is sealed after the second 

chamber has been filled.  
 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the unsealed part of the covering sheet which is in the 

region of the second chamber opening has at least portions 
which are fixed to the edge flange region via a detachable 

connection. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that a plurality of two-chamber tubs which are associated 

with one another in pairs are provided as a composite unit 
in a strip-like tub sheet, after which the first chambers 

are filled under aseptic conditions, a covering sheet is fed 
to this tub sheet composite unit, the appropriate 

aseptically filled first chambers are sealed by a first 
partial seal and afterwards the two-chamber tubs with the 

area of covering sheet placed on them and sealed are 
separated into single tubs. 
A method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
two-chamber tubs are stamped out together with the areas of 

covering sheet. 
A method according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that 
the unsealed covering sheet portion of the relevantly 

separated two-chamber tub is moved into an open position, 
the second chamber is filled under aseptic conditions and 

afterwards the second chamber is sealed via a second partial 
seal. 
An apparatus for filling and closing a two-chamber tub (2) 
which is filled with different materials, said apparatus 

consisting of a tub sheet unrolling means (7), starting from 
which the tub sheet (5) can be fed through a sterilising 

station (8) and a heating zone (10) to a tub moulding 
station (11) adjacent to which there is in the region of a 

sterile tunnel (9,9') a first filling unit (12) and a  
 

covering sheet feeder (15) with a marginal sealing means 
(16), characterised in that at the end (17) of the 

sterilising tunnel (9') there is, forming a first partial 
sealing means for the respectively filled first chamber (3) 

of the respective two-chamber tub (2), a sealing station 
(18) adjacent to which there is a severing station (22) 

which separates the two-chamber tub (2) and any areas of 
covering sheet (19,19') which may be covering the said tub 

jointly from the respective feed sheets, the said severing 
station being followed by a lifting member (27,27') which 

brings the relevant unsealed portion (19,19') of covering 
sheet on the two-chamber tub (2) into an open position so 

that the two-chamber tub (2) can with the second chamber (4) 
accessible be fed to the second filling unit (25) after 

which a closing element (31) which moves the unsealed 
portion (19') of covering sheet into a sealing position is 

so connected to a final sealing station (32) which forms the 
second partial seal that afterwards the completely sealed 

two-chamber tub (2) can be delivered onto a transporting 
unit (33). 
An apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
severing station (22) is provided with a stamping unit. 
An apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the lifting element (27) takes the form of a suction 

nozzle (35) which takes hold of the covering sheet portion 
(19') by means of a vacuum. 
An apparatus according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
the suction nozzle (35) is pivotably mounted. 
An apparatus according to Claim 10 or 11, characterised in 
that there is in the region of the covering sheet portion
