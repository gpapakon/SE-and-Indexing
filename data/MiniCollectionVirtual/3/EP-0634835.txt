<ABSTRACT>
A single bias block for a single or multiple low voltage RF circuits including one or more 
amplifiers and one or more single or double balanced mixers with compensation for temperature and 

integrated circuit process parameters. The power supply may be a lower voltage without sacrificing the 
dynamic range of the amplifier and/or mixer by applying full power supply voltage to the load with the 

bias applied to the base circuit through an operational amplifier and/or buffer circuit. For the mixer, a 
lower noise figure may also be realized by moving the gain control impedance from the emitter to the 

collector circuit. The circuits may be discrete components or part of an integrated circuit. Methods are 
disclosed for reducing the power supply vo
ltage without affecting the dynamic range of an amplifier, for 
temperature and process parameter compensation, and for controlling the gain of a mixer without affecting 

input or output impedance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to low voltage RF amplifiers and mixers and to the integration 
thereof into a semiconductor circuit in which a single bias block may serve multiple low voltage RF 
circuits with compensation for both temperature and semiconductor process parameters. With reference to the drawings, and particularly Figure 1, radio frequency amplifiers are well 
known and in common use. Such amplifiers generally operate at high voltage, e.g., 12 to 15 volts, in a 
common emitter (I.e., a.c. grounded emitter) configuration. With respect to prior art radio frequency amplifiers, and as shown in Figure 1, a radio frequency 
input signal RF may be applied to an input terminal 20 across a coupling capacitor to the base electrode 
of a NPN transistor Q1. The collector electrode is connected to the bias circuit through a load resistor RL. 
The amplified output voltage signal may be taken from the collector electrode of the transistor Q1 and 
applied across a coupling capacitor to an output terminal 22. The bias circuit for the amplifier illustrated in block form in Figure 1 may conventionally take 
several forms as shown in Figures 2 and 3 and as disclosed in greater particularity in Heyward and 
DeMaw, Solid State Design For The Radio Amateur, American Radio Relay League, Inc. Newington, 
Connecticut 1986. (See pp. 11-12, Figs. 13 & 14) In the bias circuit of Figure 2, temperature stability is 
enhanced by the use of a transistor, and in Figure 3 by the use of an operational amplifier. As is well known, the voltage on the collector electrode of common emitter amplifier at zero 
collector current applies a constraint on the upper end of its dynamic range. Dynamic range affects 
interference with other frequency channels because of the overtones produced as a result of the gain 
compression when voltage clipping begins. As a result of the voltage drop across the bias circuit in the 
amplifier of Figure 1, the maximum voltage which can be applied to the load resistor is much less than 
Vcc, typically about 0.6 Vcc. More recently, and as shown, for example, in the Specification of U.S. Patent No. 5,105,165, it 
has been proposed to bias the base of a RF amplifier rather than the emitter thereof where the emitter 
includes an inductor. However, the bias of such amplifiers does not include means for buffering the bias 
circuit transistor from the effects of loading.  An object of one aspect of the present invention to provide a novel low voltage RF amplifier
