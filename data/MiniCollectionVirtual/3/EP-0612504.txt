<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a peelable foil package for 
sutures and, in particular, for absorbable and pre-moistened 
nylon sutures. It is important for sutures to be easily and quickly 
supplied to sterile or scrubbed personnel working in a 
sterile field of use. Typically what is considered to be 
a sterile field is a designated area in which everything 
to be touched or used in surgery or a medical procedure is 
to remain sterile. It is important that the sterile 
personnel working in the sterile field do not contaminate 
the field by touching unsterilized packages. Therefore 
any suture packaging transferred into the sterile field 
must be sterile. It is also important that once in the sterile field, 
a sterile user, can easily and quickly ready the sutures 
for use without compromising suture sterility. In packaging absorbable sutures, it is important to 
provide a barrier to moisture and oxygen and prevent the 
moisture and oxygen from entering the package. It is well 
known that water will react with absorbable suture 
material to cause the polymer structure to break down. 
Even minute amounts of water or moisture can accelerate 
absorbable suture degradation. Some stability studies 
have indicated oxygen also may cause suture degradation.  
 In the packaging of hydrophilic nylon sutures, the 
sutures are pre-moistened and packaged in a humid 
environment so that the nylon material will remain 
pliable. It is important to provide a barrier to moisture 
to prevent the moisture from escaping the packaging. Thus 
a similar packaging is used for pre-moistened nylon 
sutures as is used for absorbable sutures. Presently, both absorbable sutures and pre-moistened 
nylon sutures are packaged in foil and have a secondary 
plastic and paper overwrap. In the existing art, the foil 
packaging for absorbable and pre-moistened nylon sutures 
is made from two or more sections of foil having a polymer 
lamination or coating to enhance the ability of the foil 
to act as a sufficient barrier to moisture and oxygen. It 
is believed that the intimacy of the bonds of the 
lamination or coating with the foil plays a significant 
role in closing off voids in the foil. An example of 
polymer laminated foil suture packaging is described in 
U.S. patent No. 4,014,433 and US-A-4 135 622. US-A-4 135 622 discloses the features of the preamble of claim 
1. In the prior art, the foil laminates, i.e., the foil 
sections with a coating and/or lamination, are heat-sealed 
together around their periphery forming a heat-seal around
