<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic resin composition, in which B) 0.1-30 
parts by weight of microcapsules composed of an enveloping 

layer made up of a composition that undergoes thermosensitive 
decomposition at a temperature of 200-1,000°C and a core 

component with heat resistance higher than that of said 
composition of the enveloping layer is added with A) 100 parts 

by weight of thermoplastic resin. The surface of a molded 
product of the thermoplastic resin composition can be 

subjected to vivid and durable laser marking simply and in a 
short period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a resin composition for use 
in laser marking. Examples of methods for marking thermoplastic resins include 
spraying ink by an ink jet system, screen printing and ink 
inscription systems. Generally, these methods have problems of 
thermal shock resistance (peeling of the ink surface), weathering 
resistance (discoloration of the ink) and abrasion resistance 
(abrasion of the ink surface). The ink jet system and screen printing involve applying and 
drying ink upon the resin surface to bond it there. However, in 
these methods, the ink and the resin are made of different 
materials, making it difficult to achieve a complete bond, and 
this point must be taken into consideration when choosing the 
ink. In ink-embedding systems, hollows are formed during molding 
beforehand at the locations on the resin to be marked, or it is 
engraved after it is molded, after which it is marked by 
embedding ink or paint in those locations. However, in the method where hollows are formed during 
molding, the marking configuration is limited by the product 
shape, and therefore difficulties are entailed by changing the 
marking configuration with each different product. In the method 
where engraving is performed, long periods of time are expended 
in the marking. In addition, because it is subsequently 
necessary to remove the excess ink or paint left by the 
embedding, the process becomes complex, making these methods 
unsuitable as mass production marking techniques. For the above reasons, the laser marking method, which 
features no contact, a high marking speed and ease of automation 
and process control, has recently come into frequent use on an  
 
industrial basis. Existing laser marking methods entail using 
laser light to form marks, bar codes, images, etc., on the 
surface of metals, ceramics, organic polymer materials, etc. Existing laser marking methods include irradiating the 
subject surface with laser light and 
1) marking the irradiated area by etching it to alter the 
condition of the surface (roughening or hollowing); 2) marking by utilizing decoloration or discoloration of the 
pigment or dye, etc., in the irradiated area, as recorded in 
Japanese Kokai Patent Application Nos. Sho 56[1981]-144995, Sho 
60[1985]-155493, Sho 60[1985]-166488, Sho 60[1985]-172590, Sho 
60[1985]-47065, Sho 62[1987]-50360 and Hei 3[1991]-10884; and 3) marking by utilizing changes in the condition of the 
surface (protuberances) due to foaming of the base resin, as 
recorded in Japanese Kokoku
