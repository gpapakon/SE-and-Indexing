Two-piece plastic clip for closing sausage casings, bags 
or the like, which pieces embrace the casing end, which is 

gathered into a pleat, and can he interlocked, at least one 
(1; 1') of which pieces is formed as an elongate, closed 

frame extending transversely to the longitudinal extent of 
the pleat and consisting of side members (2) and transverse 

members (3), and the other piece (1; 10; 10'), which 
overlaps the frame, comprises at least one projection, which 

faces one piece, in the form of a rib (2a; 4a; 13) which, 
when the clip is in the interlocked closed state, extends 

parallel to the side members (2) of the frame, projects into 
its interior (5), deflects the pleat in an undulating 

fashion and subjects it to pressure, the side members (2), 
the height of which is greater than their wall thickness, of 

the frame comprising at their narrow sides which face the 
pleat curved recesses (4) which are arranged between the 

transverse members, are aligned in the longitudinal 
direction of the pleat, extend over the side members and 

increase the elasticity thereof with respect to the pressure 
of the casing pleat. 
Plastic clip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the two pieces are in the form of frames and are constructed 

in an identical manner with a respective projection (2a; 
4a), which is arranged eccentrically between the side 

members in the longitudinal extent of the pleat, and can be 
interlocked by way of recesses (4) directed towards one 

another. 
Plastic clip according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the recesses (4) in the side members (2) are curved and the 

rib is an intermediate member (2a) which is recessed to a 
lesser degree and extends parallel to the side members. 
Plastic clip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a first piece (1; 1') comprises an open frame, the side 

members (2) of which have recesses in the form of U-shaped  
 

notches, and that a second piece closes the U-shaped notches 
of the first piece (1; 1'), the rib (13) being moulded onto 

the second piece (10; 10'). 
Plastic clip according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that locking notches (6) are formed in the 

transverse members (3) of one piece (1; 1'), behind which 
notches locking arms (12, 14), which are moulded onto the 

other piece (10; 10'), engage in the closed state. 
Plastic clip according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the rib (13) runs into at least one of the locking arms 

(12). 
Plastic clip according to claims 2 and 5, characterised 
in that a locking notch (6a) and a locking arm (12) are in 

each case formed in or at the two transverse members (3) of 
each piece such that they are next to one another but 

transposed relative to a central plane extending 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the pleat and 

centrally between the side members (2) (Figure 1). 
Plastic clip according to one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that, when in the closed state, the locking 

arms (12) of the second piece (10; 10') - viewed in the 
direction of the U-shaped recesses (4) - are arranged next 

to the recesses (4) on both sides (staggered in the viewing 
direction). 
Plastic clip according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the locking arms (12) taper. 
Plastic clip according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the frame of the first piece (1') is divided by a central 

member (20) extending parallel to the side members (2), that 
the central member (20) has a notch (21) which is not as 

deep as the notches (4) in the side members (2), and that 
the second piece (10') comprises two pairs of locking arms 

(12) which in each case engage in one of the two frame  
 

interiors (5). 
Plastic clip according to claim 10, characterised in 
that a slit (22) is provided in the plane of the central 

member (20) in the second piece (10'), into which slit the 
central member (20) pushes the casing pleat. 
Storable chain of plastic clips according to at least 

one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
plurality of like pieces (1, 10; 1', 10') are each connected 

by connecting bridges (e.g. so-called film hinges) which are 
integrally moulded on at the sides. 
Storable chain of plastic clips according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the pieces (1, 10; 1', 10') are 

connected by means of continuous (possibly self-adhesive) 
tapes, threads or the like.
