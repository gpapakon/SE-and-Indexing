<ABSTRACT>
Bioadhesive microemulsions or liposomic dispersions containing proteic substances, especially calcitonin, that allow the systemic, local or topical administration of drugs by transmucosal route are described. This type of administration shows some considerable advantages of activity, tolerability, dosage individualization and drug stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to pharmaceutical 
compositions in the form of microemulsions or liposomic 
dispersions for the transmucousal administration of 
proteins or peptidic substances pharmacologically 
active; they differ from the known liposomic or 
microemulsified compositions in that they contain in 
addition a thermosetting agent able to enhance the 
residence time on the administration site and, 
consequently, to promote the absorption of the 
delivered drug. The administration of proteinic substances has 
been, from few years ago, limited to the parenteral 
route as it was the only one which granted a good 
absorption to molecules having a complex structure and 
not able to tolerate environments with a high acidity 
and rich of proteolytic enzymes such as that ones can 
be found in the digestive apparatus. The need to apply 
by means of an invasive way, the difficulty in 
obtaining, on a large scale, many proteins from natural 
sources and the very high activity of such substances, 
with the consequent risks of overdosage, have 
determined the limited diffusion of such substances in 
the clinical practice. Recent attempts to orally administer the peptide 
substances with drug delivery systems such as 
microparticles and liposomes, did not obtain relevant  
 
results in absorption or reproduciblity of the same: 
the transit time variability in the digestive 
apparatus, associated to the large presence of 
proteolytic enzymes, has made the researcher to 
consider the oral administration as a problem. More recently, always in the attempt to avoid the 
more invasive parenteral administration, formulations 
suitable to the nasal administration of proteinic 
substances have been proposed. The tipical disadvantage of this way of 
administration consists in: the relatively reduced area 
available for the absorption, the high clearance (which 
reduce the time of contact) and the particular 
characteristic of the muconasal epithelium which covers 
the upper respiratory organs, that is the presence of 
cilia in association with mucus producing glands. In addition, the "absorption promoters" frequently 
used in formulations for nasal administration produce a 
relevant damage to the mucociliary clearance of the 
deposit zone of the formulation and give problems to 
the repeated or chronic treatment cycles. With the same aims,it has also been proposed the 
rectal administration of protein substances: this kind 
of administration is nevertheless confined in the 
mediterranean area and even considered
