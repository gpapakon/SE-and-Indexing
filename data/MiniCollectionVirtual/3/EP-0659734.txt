<ABSTRACT>
The invention is aimed at an improved process for the continuous preparation of 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine in high yield and high purity (isophoronediamine) from 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (isophoronenitrile) by aminating hydrogenation with hydrogen and ammonia in the presence of a solid bed catalyst. Isophoronediamine is a raw material for the preparation of isophoronediisocyanate, an amine component for polyamides and a curing component for epoxy resins. According to the invention, the aminating hydrogenation is carried out by allowing a mixture of isophoronenitrile, ammonia and a C1-C3-alcohol to trickle over a trickle-bed reactor provided with a Co and/or Ru solid-bed catalyst at 3 to 8 MPa and a temperature of 40 to 150 DEG C, preferably 90 to 130 DEG C, in the presence of hydrogen and working up the reaction mixture by distillation. A high-boiling by-product fraction, containing a bicyclic amidine, is preferably added to the mixture to be hydrogenated, whereby the yield is appreciably increased.

A process for the preparation of 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine 
(isophoronediamine, IPDA) 

from 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (isophorone 
nitrile, IPN), wherein a mixture of isophorone 

nitrile, an organic solvent selected from the C
1
- to 
C
3
- alcohols and ammonia, at a pressure in the range 
from 3 to 10 MPa and at a temperature in the range 

from 80 to 150°C, is hydrogenated by hydrogen in the 
presence of at least one hydrogenation catalyst 

selected from the cobalt and/or ruthenium fixed bed 
catalysts and the reaction mixture is worked up by 

distillation, characterised in that the aminating 
hydrogenation is carried out in a trickle-bed reactor, 

the mixture of isophorone nitrile, organic solvent and 
ammonia being introduced at the upper end of the 

reactor onto the catalyst bed and the reaction mixture 

obtained after the reactants have trickled through the 
catalyst bed being withdrawn at the lower end of the 

reactor. 
The process for the preparation of isophorone diamine 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature in the 
range of from 90 to 130°C and at a pressure of from 5 

to 8 MPa. 
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the solvent used is methanol, the mixture 

introduced onto the catalyst bed contains from 10 to 
40 wt.%, preferably 10 to 30 wt.%, of isophorone 

nitrile and from 10 to 40 wt.%, preferably 20 to 
40 wt.%, of ammonia and the mixture forms a 

homogeneous solution. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the hydrogenation catalyst used 

is a supported catalyst which consists substantially  
 

of an inorganic support, preferably an oxide or 
silicate material, and cobalt, the catalyst containing 

in total from 10 to 70 wt.% of cobalt. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a high-boiling fraction which 

distils off after the isophoronediamine main fraction 
during the working up of the reaction mixture by 

distillation and which contains, in addition to 
residues of isophoronediamine, 3,3,5-trimethyl-6-imino-7-azabicyclo-[3,2,1]
octane 
as main component 

together with the mixture of isophorone nitrile, 
solvent and ammonia, is passed to the trickle-bed 

reactor. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the aminating hydrogenation is 

carried out in a trickle-bed reactor having an upper 
layer arranged therein consisting of a ruthenium 

supported catalyst, preferably ruthenium 
on γ-aluminium oxide, and a lower layer consisting of 

a cobalt fixed bed catalyst, the said upper layer and 
the said lower layer possibly also being arranged, 

instead of in one reactor, in two separate reactors 
arranged one behind the another in the sequence 

referred to. 
The process according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the volume of the fixed bed catalyst containing 

ruthenium constitutes 3 to 30%, preferably 5 to 20%, 
of the total volume of fixed bed catalyst. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that hydrogen is supplied at the 

upper or lower end of the trickle-bed reactor in a 
quantity such that no hydrogen is discharged from the 

reactor and has to be recirculated.  
 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the mixture of isophorone 

nitrile, solvent and ammonia, which preferably 
contains from 10 to 30 wt.% of isophorone nitrile and 

from 20 to 40 wt.% of ammonia and methanol as solvent, 
is caused to trickle over the catalyst bed of the 

reactor at an LHSV value (liquid hourly space 
velocity) of from 0.8 to 1.5 h
