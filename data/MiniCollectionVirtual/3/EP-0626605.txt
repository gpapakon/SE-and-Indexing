<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an optical scanning 
device, an optical sensor device employing said optical 
scanning device, a device to read coded data and a point-of-sale 
(POS) system. More specifically, it the present 
invention is directed to an optical scanning device to be 
used with a laser beam printer, a bar code scanner, or an 
area scanner with a beam scanning scheme, and in particular 
an optical scanning device capable of scanning a light beam 
in two dimensions. In the past, various schemes have been advanced to 
enhance the reading capability of bar code scanners which 
read a bar code by scanning a light beam. To prevent 
reading errors caused by a scratch or dirt on part of the 
bar code, and to ensure that the code be read properly, the 
polygonal scanner was developed. This scanner employed a 
raster scanning scheme by which a light beam was scanned 
along a number of parallel lines 91, as shown in Figure 16 
(a). The scheme by which the polygonal scanner operated was 
as follows. A polygonal mirror caused a light beam to scan 
as it rotated and reflected the beam. If each of the 
mirror surfaces was made to have a different slope with 
respect to the rotational axis of the polygonal mirror, the 
scanner could be realized with a relatively simple 
configuration. However, with a polygonal scanner using a 
raster scanning scheme, if the fixed orientation of the bar 
code, that is to say, the path along which the bar code is  
 
arranged, is not kept virtually parallel with the path 
along which the beam is scanning, the beam will fail to 
scan the entire code and consequently be unable to read it. To insure that the light beam will make an accurate 
parallel scan of the bar code regardless of its 
orientation, a device was developed which used a hologram 
disc or a number of mirrors to scan a beam along the radial 
or X-shaped pattern 92, as shown in Figure 16 (b). Bar code scanners like these, which can scan a beam of 
light in many directions or in a radial pattern, can can read 
bar codes with relative accuracy regardless of how the code 
may be oriented. For this reason they are widely used for 
such applications as supermarket checkouts where the 
orientation of the code will vary. However, this type of 
bar code reader requires a hologram disc or multiple 
mirrors to scan the beam of light in numerous directions, 
which results in the reader itself becoming a relatively 
large item. Further, since it is necessary to use a large 
number of extremely accurate optical components,
