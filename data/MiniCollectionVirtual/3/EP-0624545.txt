<ABSTRACT>
The production of spring inserts (9) can be considerably 
improved by means of the method according to the invention, 

whereby use is made according to requirements of strings 
(15) with different resiliency and/or damping 

characteristics. 
This makes it possible, in one and the same plant, to produce 
spring inserts (9) which are built up of strings with 

different characteristics, whereby spring inserts (9) with 
improved characteristics can be produced. 
The joining of the strings (15) in the formation of the 
spring insert (9) is carried out using an adhesive (26) 

which is applied to one side of the string as this passes a 
nozzle (24). The rate of production can hereby be increased 

in relation to the known methods of adhesive application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of producing a spring insert 
from strings of springs which are individually encased 
in a pocket of material, so-called pocketed springs, said 
strings having an adhesive applied and being compressed to 
form the spring insert, said strings having different resiliency 
and/or damping characteristics, and said strings 
are cut from at least one length, and where each length is 
fed to a cutting mechanism. The said method is known from EP-A-0089789, and by this 
known method it is possible in a surprisingly simple manner 
to produce a spring insert with ideal characteristics, in 
that there can be built up a spring insert which is in 
accordance with the load on the individual parts of the 
spring insert. This permits production of spring inserts, 
and herewith mattresses, cushions etc., which are in 
complete accordance with the degree of support they are 
desired to provide. Further another method is known from EP-A-0421495 which 
method involve the following steps and features in producing 
a spring insert: 
A string is cut from a length in a cutting device to which 
several lengths are supplied, and each length is fed to a 
cutting mechanism by means of an adjustable feeding 
arrangement in such a manner that the selection of the 
length and the length of the string can be adjusted, an adhesive is applied to the string during its movement 
past one or more nozzles before the compression,  
 the adhesive is applied only to the outer side of the 
pockets where pockets of abutting strings lie up against 
each other after the compression, and the adhesive is pumped out through the nozzle(s) in a 
jet on the outer side of the pocket when the pocket is 
opposite the nozzle(s). However, none of the mentioned applications shows a 
suitable way of orienting the length before applying the 
adhesive so that the lengths and the strings can be conveyed 
without risk for being displaced in relation to the 
support and one another. With the method according to the invention, this can be 
effected in a simple manner, 
such as disclosed in the characterising portion of the claim, 
when the lengths are arranged 
so that they are fed with the longitudinal axes of the 
pocket-springs being horizontal, and thereafter the string 
are tipped 90Â° before applying the adhesive, whereby the 
length and the string are conveyed without risk of displacement 
in relation to their support or one another. In the following section, an example of a plant for the 
execution of the method will be

said strings (15) having different resiliency and/or

is fed to a cutting mechanism (12, 13), 
characterized
 
in that the length(s) (7, 8) are fed over 

wheels/sprockets (6, 11) with horizontally-extending axes 
to the cutting mechanism (12, 13), after which the string 

(15) is fed in a commonly-known manner on to a turning 
table (2) where the string (15) is tipped upright, whereafter 

the string (15), by means of a chain conveyor (23) in 
the form of an endless chain over carrier wheels with vertical 

axes, is fed past the adhesive application nozzle(s) 
(24) before being positioned on a horizontally-displaceable 

arm (27) which thereafter presses the string (15) up 
against the preceding string in the spring insert (9).
