<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel 6-alkylphenanthridines which are used in the pharmaceutical industry
for the production of medicaments.German Patent Application DE 11 99 773 describes the preparation of 6-methyl-8,9-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b-octahydrophenanthridine,
which should have analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic
properties. In the Indian Journal of Chemistry 7, 1969, 674-677 the preparation of ethyl
1,2,3,4,4a,10b-hexahydrophenanthridine-6-butyrate is described. European Patent Application
EP 0 045 171 discloses 9-amino-1-hydroxyoctahydrobenzo(c)quinolines
useful as CNS agents.It has now been found that the novel 6-alkylphenanthridines which are described below in greater detail
have surprising and particularly advantageous properties.The invention thus relates to compounds of the formula I

in which
R1is hydroxyl, 1-4C-alkoxy, 3-7C-cycloalkoxy, 3-7C-cycloalkylmethoxy or completely or predominantly
fluorine-substituted 1-4C-alkoxy, R2is hydroxyl, 1-4C-alkoxy, 3-7C-cycloalkoxy, 3-7C-cycloalkylmethoxy or completely or predominantly
fluorine-substituted 1-4C-alkoxy,
or in which
R1 and R2together are a 1-2C-alkylenedioxy group,R3is hydrogen or 1-4C-alkyl,R31is hydrogen or 1-4C-alkyl,
or in which
R3 and R31together are a 1-4C-alkylene group,R4is hydrogen or 1-4C-alkyl,R5is hydrogen,R51is hydrogen,
or in which
R5 and R51together are an additional bond,Ais 1-6C-alkylene or 5-7C-cycloalkylene,R6is COOR61 or CON(R62)R63, where
R61 is hydrogen, 1-7C-alkyl, 3-7C-cycloalkyl or 3-7C-cycloalkylmethyl and
R62 and R63 independently of one another are hydrogen, 1-7C-alkyl, 3-7C-cycloalkyl or
3-7C-cycloalkylmethyl,
and the salts of these compounds.1-4C-Alkyl represents a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples
which may be mentioned are the butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, propyl, isopropyl and, preferably,
the ethyl and methyl radicals.1-4C-Alkoxy represents radicals which, in addition to the oxygen atom, contain a straight-chain or
branched alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are the butoxy,
isobutoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy and, preferably, the ethoxy and methoxy
radicals.3-7C-Cycloalkoxy represents cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclohexyloxy and cycloheptyloxy,
of which cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy and cyclopentyloxy are preferred.3-7C-Cycloalkylmethoxy represents cyclopropylmethoxy, cyclobutylmethoxy, cyclopentylmethoxy,
cyclohexylmethoxy and cycloheptylmethoxy, of which
