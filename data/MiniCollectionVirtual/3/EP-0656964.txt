<DESCRIPTION>
Wet-laid nonwoven sheets of synthetic polymeric fibrids and short length
staple fibers are known from U.S. Patent No. 2,999,788. As taught in said
patent, the fibrids are prepared by shear precipitation of solutions of the
polymer, preferably in an aqueous medium which extracts the polymer solvent
and causes the polymer to come out of solution. Generally, the fibrids are
readily converted into paper by paper-forming techniques similar to those
employed with wood pulp.Activated carbon is well-known to be useful in removing impurities from
air, water and solvents because of its very high microporous surface area ( > 500
m2/g). In large industrial systems, beds of loose carbon are commonly used for
removing impurities from gaseous and liquid streams. In smaller operations,
fibrous systems (e.g. felts, papers) in which carbon is mechanically entrained or
adhesively attached, are often used.Fibrous systems employing mechanically entrapped carbon particles are
invariably "dirty". That is, the fibrous matrix sheds small particles when pulsed,
shaken, or "worked". The shed particles are messy and can interfere with
electrical equipment because they are conductive.To help alleviate the shedding problem, low porosity fibrous sheets can
be bonded to the face of the fibrous system or the fibrous system can be
impregnated with a resin. These methods increase the pressure drop needed to
maintain flow and do not completely solve the shedding problem, especially if
the fibrous system is vigorously worked.Non-shedding, high porosity structures can be obtained by affixing carbon
particles to the fibers of high-loft non-wovens with an adhesive. However, the
adhesive reduces the activity of the carbon. Also, the method is suitable only for
a highly open porous fiber matrix wherein the carbon particles can penetrate
into the center of the structure.EP-A-0,031,719 teaches absorbent textile quality films
or fibers. Starting at page 2, line 6 to line 24 of EP-A-0,031,719,
the limitations of earlier attempts to incorporate
sorptive material into fiber forming polymers is described.
The reference describes the limitation on both the amount of
sorptive material that could be incorporated into the
polymeric fiber or film as well as the less than desirable
sorptive activity of the material once it was incorporated 
into the polymer. Low sorptive activity was attributed to
occlusion of the pores of the sorptive agent by polymer. The
inventors of EP-A-0,031,719 sought to solve this problem by
incorporating into the polymer spin
