<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to patent claim 1 
to transfer wind energy into electric energy. In the wind power 
station there are a number of rotors rotated by wind energy and 
coupled to function partly by same wind stream. Wind power stations are previously known a.o. from Finnish 
patent No. 11.121 and application No. 863734. Further, in the 
USA and in Denmark wind power stations with 3-blade rotors are 
known, but the utilization of wind dynamics for producing 
electricity is poor in these stations. By means of this iventional method and the wind power station 
a decisive improvment is achieved in this respect. The invention 
is characterized in what is presented in the patent 
claims. The most important advantages of the invention is that the wind 
stream is effectively guided in the right direction simultaneously 
to a number of rotors and the rotative wind stream of 
the lower rotors activates the rotation of the upper rotors and 
there are several generators connected to the rotors. The wind 
speed is raised before reaching the main rotor and traversal 
wind quiding plates at the blade tips can retain the wind and 
make the wind wind along with the blades in order to improve 
the efficiency of the wind power station. In the following the invention is presented in detail with 
reference to the enclosed drawing, where 
Fig. 1 is a side view of a wind power station. Fig. 2 is a front view of a wind power station. Figure 1 shows a wind power station mounted on a base 1 on 
which it can turn by means of a slewing bearing in point 2. In 
the lower part of the wind power station frame 13 four superposed 
rotors 4 are arranged, which have a radial blade system 
5. The rotors have lateral axles fastened with bearings and 
rotating clockwise. The rotation energy of the rotors is  
 
utilized for production of electricity. The wind is directed to 
the rotors by means means of guiding plates, of which a part 6 
is visible in this sectional illustration. The wind stream, 
still increasing in channel 7, is directed to the main rotor 8. 
The stream enters from an advantageous direction from channel 
7 and turns the main rotor. Further, the main rotor is rotated 
by direct wind and direct wind entering through a guide 12, the 
direction of which wind is also advatageous by means of this 
arrangement. The traveral wind guiding plates 10 at the tips of 
the rotor blades 9 can retain the wind and make the wind wind 
along with the blades, thus activating the production of electricity 
by a
