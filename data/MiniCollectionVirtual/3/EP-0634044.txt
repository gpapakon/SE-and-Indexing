<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an improved belt for a belt-driven 
recording tape pack such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,692,255 (Von 
Behren). In the cartridge of the Von Behren patent, magnetic recording tape is 
driven by a thin, continuous, flexible, pretensioned belt which in turn is driven 
by a single reversible drive motor that provides rapid acceleration and 
deceleration of the recording tape in either direction. In such a cartridge, 
pressure is exerted by the belt on the tape pack over an extended area, and the 
pressure arises solely from the tension in the belt. Since the development of the belt-driven cartridge by Von Behren in 
1972, there has been a continuing effort to develop cartridges which have a 
higher storage capacity than that of the original Von Behren cartridge. The 
cartridge of the Von Behren patent operated at tape transport speeds of about 76 
cm/sec with a linear recording density of about 630 flux reversals per cm, and 
a total storage capacity of about 3 Megabytes. By the early 1980s, the total 
storage capacity had been expanded to 67.5 Megabytes (formatted) by using a 
thinner tape (which increases the amount of the tape that will fit in a cartridge), 
a tape speed of 230 cm/sec, and a recording density of 3,900 flux reversals per 
cm. This new tape had a much finer surface texture than the old tape, in which 
average surface asperities were about 22 nm, compared with over 100 nm for the 
old tape. The higher tape speeds and recording densities of the newer tapes 
required intimate tape-to-head contact and improved uniformity of tape speed to 
avoid data handling errors. Intimate tape-to-head contact requires uniform tape 
tension, which in turn requires good contact between the drive belt and tape 
pack.  
 In 1984, a new textured drive belt having a microscopically rough surface 
was disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,466,564 (Smith). The textured belt surface 
provided for better traction at the belt/tape interface, enabling higher and more 
stable tape tension at increased tape speeds. The textured belt allowed air 
molecules to rapidly escape from between the belt and tape during high speed 
tape winding. This reduced hydrodynamic "lift-off," much like ordinary tread 
on an automobile tire prevents hydroplaning on wet highways. Since 1984, the effort to increase the storage capacity of data cartridges 
has continued. Today's data cartridges have a total storage capacity in excess of 
a Gigabyte (formatted), a tape speed of 305 cm/sec and a recording

<CLAIMS>
A thin, continuous, flexible data cartridge drive belt 
for use as a drive belt for driving a tape pack of a 

belt-driven data cartridge, the drive belt being adapted 
to contact the tape pack for driving it, wherein the belt 

(34, 40) has a single raised portion (36, 42) which extends 
longitudinally along the center of the face of the 

belt that is provided to contact the tape pack (17) contained 
within the data cartridge (10). 
The belt recited in claim 1, wherein the raised portion 
comprises a rectangular rib. 
The belt recited in claim 1, wherein the width of the 
raised portion is about one-third of the width of the 

face of the belt. 
A pair of thin, continuous, flexible data cartridge drive 
belts for use as a drive belt for driving a tape pack of 

a belt-driven data cartridge, the drive belt being adapted 
to contact the tape pack for driving it, wherein the 

first belt (34) is narrower than the second belt (36) and 
extends longitudinally along the center of the face of 

the second belt that is provided to contact the tape pack 
(17) contained within the data cartridge (10). 
The pair of belts recited in claim 4, wherein the width 
cf the face of the first belt is about one-third of the 

width of the face of the second belt. 
A belt-driven tape pack comprising:  
 


a pair of hubs (12, 14) on which is wound a length of 
tape (16); and 
a drive belt (40) entrained around a drive roller (20), a 
pair of guide rollers (22, 24), and a tape pack (17), 

wherein the belt has a single raised portion (42) which 
extends longitudinally along the center of the face of 

the belt that contacts the tape pack (17). 
The belt-driven tape pack recited in claim 6, wherein the 
raised portion of the belt comprises a rectangular rib. 
The belt-driven tape pack recited in claim 6, wherein the 
width of the raised portion of the belt is about one-third 

of the width of the face of the belt. 
A belt-driven tape pack comprising: 

a pair of hubs (12, 14) on which is wound a length of 
tape (16); and 
a first and second drive belt (34, 46) entrained around a 
driver roller (20), a pair of guide rollers (22, 24), and 

a tape pack (17), wherein the first belt (34) is narrower 
than the second belt (36) and extends longitudinally 

along the center of the face of the second belt that contacts 
the tape pack (17). 
The pair of belts recited in claim 9, wherein the width 
of the face of the first belt is about one-third of the 

width of the face of the second belt.
