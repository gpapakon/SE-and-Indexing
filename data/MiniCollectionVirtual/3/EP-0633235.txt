<ABSTRACT>
A process is intended for composting organic materials (biodegradation material), in particular waste, for example domestic waste or waste which resembles domestic waste. The biodegradation material is introduced into a sealed container and subjected to microbial degradation while passing in oxygen. A mixture of pure oxygen and waste air is furthermore added to the biodegradation material. To improve such a process, the CO2 in the waste air is returned to the biodegradation material. The water in the waste air which emanates from the biodegradation material is removed.

<CLAIMS>
Process of composting, in which the material
undergoing biodegradation is introduced into a sealed

container and subjected to microbial biodegradation while
passing in oxygen, during which process a mixture of pure

oxygen and outgoing air is furthermore passed to the
material undergoing biodegradation, characterized in that

the CO
2
 which forms part of the outgoing air is returned
to the material undergoing biodegradation and that the

water which forms part of the outgoing air that escapes
from the material undergoing biodegradation is separated

off by means of cooling and condensation.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the outgoing air which escapes from the material

undergoing biodegradation is essentially returned to the
material undergoing biodegradation.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the outgoing air which escapes from the material

undergoing biodegradation is returned continuously to the
material undergoing biodegradation.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of gas recirculated per

unit time is increased when the temperature in the
material undergoing biodegradation rises.
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the amount of gas circulated per

unit time is reduced when the temperature in the material
undergoing biodegradation drops.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the moisture content in the gas 

circulated is kept constant at a particular set value.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the temperature in the container is

at least 60Â°C.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the water which forms part of the

outgoing air is separated off in a heat exchanger by
means of cooling and condensation.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
that electrical energy is generated from the heat conveyed

during condensation.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of oxygen passed in per

unit time is increased when the CO
2
 content rises.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the outgoing air is not filtered in

a separate step.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the outgoing air is passed through

a water bath.
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the outgoing air is passed through the condensate.
Process according to Claim 12 or 13, characterized
in that the heat conveyed by the outgoing air to the

water bath is conveyed to a heat exchanger.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the outgoing air is cleaned before

the biodegradation process is complete.
