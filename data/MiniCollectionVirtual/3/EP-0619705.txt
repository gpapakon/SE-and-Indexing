<ABSTRACT>
A device for cutting out shapes out of flat bodies has a first cutting edge and second cutting edges that laterally projects away from the first cutting edge. An imaginary envelope (3) of the second cutting edges (2) at the side opposite to the first cutting edge (1) extends essentially parallel to the first cutting edge (1). The shapes are thus completely delimited by the first cutting edge (1) and/or envelope (3) and by the second cutting edges (2). Shapes for pastry or the like that can be preferably produced with this device are cut out of dough next to each other and are essentially U shaped. The adjacent shapes (7, 8) may be delimited by an essentially sinusoidal cutting line (15) and by cutting lines (16, 17) that envelop the sinusoidal cutting lines (15) on both sides. Shapes for pastry having only two corners may thus be produced without clippings.
