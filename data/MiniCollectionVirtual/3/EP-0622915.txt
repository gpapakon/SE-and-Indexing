<ABSTRACT>
A technique for reducing signal degradation and fading within a long optical 
transmission by utilizing a rotating waveplate arrangement to r
otate the SOP of an optical 
signal launched into the transmission system, and thereby minimize polarization dependent 

hole-burning ("PDHB"). This effectively reduces the degree of polarization of the launched 
optical signal, without degrading the noise and dispersion characteristics of the signal. The 

rate of waveplate rotation is chosen to ensure that the SOP of the launched signal does not 
remain at a particular SOP long enough to anisotropically saturate any optical amplifier 

employed within the transmission system, and give rise to PDHB.

<DESCRIPTION>
Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in undersea
or trans-continental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems which employ optical amplifier
repeaters, are subject to decreased performance due to a host of impairments that increase as
a function of the length of the optical fiber comprising the transmission path. Typically, in
such long optical transmission systems, these impairments vary with time and cause a random
fluctuation in the signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") of the transmission path. This random
fluctuation contributes to a phenomenon known as signal fading. Signal fading can result in
an increased bit error rate ("BER") for digital signals transmitted via the optical fiber path.
When the SNR of a digital signal within such a transmission system becomes unacceptably
small (resulting in an undesirably high BER), a signal fade is said to have occurred.
Experimental evidence has shown that polarization dependent effects, induced by the optical
fiber itself and/or other optical components (e.g., repeaters, amplifiers, etc.) along the
transmission path, contribute to signal fading and SNR fluctuations. In particular, one of these
effects has now been identified as polarization dependent hole-burning ("PDHB"), which is
related to the population inversion dynamics of the optical amplifiers. A discussion of hole-burning
is provided by D.W. Douglas, R.A. Haas, W.F. Krupke, and M.J. Weber in "Spectral
and Polarization Hole Burning in Neodymium Glass Lasers"; IEEE Journal of Quantum
Electronics, Vol. QE-19, No. 11, November 1983.PDHB reduces gain of the optical amplifiers within the long haul transmission
system for any signal having a state of polarization ("SOP") parallel to that of the primary
optical signal carried by the transmission system. However, the gain provided by these
amplifiers for optical signals having an SOP orthogonal to that of the primary signal remains
relatively unaffected. In simplified terms, the primary optical signal produces an anisotropic
saturation of the amplifier that is dependent upon the SOP of the primary optical signal. The
anisotropic saturation reduces the level of population inversion within the amplifier, and
results in a lower gain for optical signals having the same SOP as the primary optical signal.
This effectively causes the amplifier to preferentially enhance noise having an SOP orthogonal
to that of the primary signal. This enhanced noise lowers the SNR of the transmission system 
and causes an increased BER.Prior methods for
