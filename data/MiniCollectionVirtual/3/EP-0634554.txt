<ABSTRACT>
A structural element, in particular for door and 
window frames, made up of profiles (1,7,8,9) made from different 

materials such as wood and metal, is joined together by 
means of interference fixing elements (12) engaged in slots (3,10) 

to hold the component profiles together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite 
structural element made up of profile components made 
of different types of material and a method for joining 
them together to form a composite profile capable of 
being used as a structural element. Said composite profiles are destined in particular 
for use in the field of door and window frames. At present, in the field of door and window 
frames, there are profiles made up of different 
materials such as aluminium and wood, metal and plastic 
and the like. These door and window frames are 
manufactured according to specific processes described 
in the following. A first type of profile is formed by joining 
together two components of different materials by means 
of the deposition of a layer of synthetic resin on the 
connecting surface of one of the profiles. The resin 
causes the surface to adhere to the connecting surface 
of the other profile, so that the two profiles are 
connected to each other in a fixed manner. However, this system does not allow any 
substitution of a single component in the composite 
profile in case of need, and furthermore the operation 
for forming the composite profile requires the use of 
expensive and complex apparatus to work the resin. A second type of composite profile is formed by 
joining components of different materials by means of 
continuous fixed joint devices along the whole length 
of the profile. This solution does not require use of the resin 
working apparatus, but employs more simple apparatus 
made up of a roller press. However, even in this form 
of embodiment of the composite profile it is not 
possible to replace a single component in the profile, 
in case of need. Object of the present invention is therefore to  
 
eliminate the problems described above by supplying a 
method for joining together composite profiles and 
supplying fixing elements, made for that purpose, in 
such a way that joining together of the composite 
profiles is surprisingly easier and takes place by a 
simple operation to lock the fixing elements on each of 
the components making up the composite profile, using a 
locking tool. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a method for joining together composite 
profiles and structural fixing elements in such a way 
that it is possible to replace a single component 
forming the composite profile, in case of need, without 
having to replace the whole of the composite profile. The object of the invention is a composite 
structural element, in particular for door and

<CLAIMS>
A composite structural element, in particular 
for door and window frames, made up of components in 

different materials joined together, characterized in 
that it comprises: 

   a first profile in a first type of material, 
having a tubular shaped central body (1) on which a 

longitudinal surface is defined, said surface having a 
corner lying along a line generally opposite to the 

position of a shaped element of an aesthetic type, and 
a pair of shaped fins (5) being arranged along said 

surface to form an engagement slot (3) therewith; 
   a second profile of a second type of material, 

having an upper visible surface (7) and a lower 
engagement surface, said lower surface being shaped 

with an undercut slot (10); and 
   fixing elements (12) having a cylindrical body and 

two shaped ends (13, 14), said fixing elements (12) 
being capable when in a first position of being 

slidingly received and simultaneously held in the slot 
(3) of the first profile and in the slot (10) of said 

second profile, and when in a second position, turned 
by 90° around the axis of said cylindrical body with 

respect to said first position, being capable of 
blocking said ends in said slots by interference fit 

and of fixing said two profiles together in a non-permanent 
manner. 
A structural element according to claim 1, in 
which said fixing elements have between said two shaped 

ends a central portion, that can be engaged with a 
locking key to carry out said rotation. 
A structural element according to claims 1 or 
2, in which said ends (13), (14) of the fixing elements 

are of double cam shape to engage in an interference 

fit with said slots (3), (10). 
A structural element according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, in which a thin, gauged profile (11) is 

 
received in the undercut slot (10) in said second 

profile to cover the walls thereof. 
A structural element according to claim 4, in 
which said thin profile (11) is of extruded synthetic 

material. 
A structural element according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, in which said first structural element 

is of metal. 
A structural element according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6, in which said second structural element 

is of wood. 
A structural element according to any one of 
claims 1 to 7, in which the above mentioned central 

tubular body (1) of the first profile is defined by a 
further longitudinal surface adjacent to the 

aforementioned longitudinal surface provided with 
shaped fins (4) to define an additional slot (2) for 

engagement with elements supporting and serving the 
door or window frame. 
A method for joining together in a non-permanent 
manner components of materials of different 

types, to form composite profiles, in particular 
structural elements for door and window frames, in 

which a first component of a first type of material 
with a substantially tubular central body (1) has a 

longitudinal surface provided with shaped fins (5) 
which form an engagement slot (3), and a second 

component of a second type of material has a lower 
surface with an undercut slot (10), characterized in 

that the fixing elements (12) with a cylindrical body 
are provided at both ends with shaped heads, so that 

said heads are slidingly engaged simultaneously with 
said engagement slot (3) and with said undercut slot 

(10), respectively, and subsequently said fixing 
elements are rotated by 90° using a locking tool so as 

to engage said shaped heads in an interference fit with 
said slots and block the two components together to 

 
form the composite profile.
