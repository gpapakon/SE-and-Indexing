<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the separation of oxygenated compounds, comprising, mostly, methanol and optionally a minor part of water and/or of dimethyl ether, from a mixture of hydrocarbons, which can have 3 to 8 carbon atoms, containing the oxygenated compounds. A distillation stage of the mixture is carried out in a distillation region (D). A gaseous distillate (line 2) comprising methanol, optionally water, optionally dimethyl ether and hydrocarbons, is collected at the head of the distillation region. This gaseous distillate is separated by settling in a knockout vessel (B) and the collection is carried out (line 6) of at least one liquid organic phase, conveyed as reflux into the head of the distillation region D, and optionally of a liquid aqueous phase (line 5), as well as optionally of a gaseous phase (line 4). A phase is withdrawn laterally from the distillation region (line 8) and is conveyed into a permeation region (PV) comprising at least one membrane which is selectively permeable to methanol; a permeation stage of the said phase is carried out. The collection is carried out, downstream of the permeation region, of at least one permeate (line 14), preferably in the vapour phase, which is enriched in methanol and, upstream of the permeation region, of at least one retentate (line 11), which is optionally recycled in the distillation region, and the mixture of purified hydrocarbons (line 16) is withdrawn at the bottom of the distillation column.

A process for the separation of oxygenated 
compounds, containing mainly methanol and possibly a 

minor amount of water and/or dimethyl ether, from a 
mixture of hydrocarbons containing 3 to 8 carbon 

atoms containing the oxygenated compounds, 
comprising a distillation step of the mixture in a 

distillation step in a distillation zone under 
appropriate temperature and pressure conditions, wherein 

a gaseous distillate containing methanol, if the case 
arises water and/or dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons, is taken overhead 

and at least partially condensed and at least 
partially recycled, a phase is extracted as a side 

stream from the distillation zone and sent under 
suitable conditions to a permeation zone comprising 

at least one membrane which is selectively permeable 
to methanol; a permeation step is carried out on 

said phase, at least one permeate is recovered 
downstream of the permeation zone, preferably as a 

vapour enriched in methanol and at least one residue 
is recovered upstream of the permeation zone, and 

the purified hydrocarbon mixture is extracted from 
the bottom of the distillation zone.  

 
Process according to claim 1 wherein the phase is 
extracted as a side stream from at least one tray in 

the distillation zone where the methanol 
concentration is at least equal to that of the 

methanol in the hydrocarbon mixture, preferably to 
the tray where the methanol concentration is 

substantially maximal. 
Process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the 
pressure in the distillation zone is above 1 bar 

absolute, the head temperature is 40째C to 120째C and 
the bottom temperature is 70째C to 200째C, and wherein 

the pressure in the permeation zone is greater than, 
equal to or less than the pressure in the 

distillation zone. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the residue is recycled to the distillation 

zone under suitable conditions, advantageously to a 
lower tray than that of the side stream extraction 

of said phase. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
wherein the residue is recycled under suitable  

 
conditions to the tray where the composition is 

substantially the same as that of the residue. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
wherein the gaseous distillate is decanted and 

condensed, an organic liquid phase which may be 
saturated with water is recovered and recycled to 

the head of the column with a reflux ratio of 0.3 to 
3 times the mass flow rate of the hydrocarbon 

mixture, and an aqueous phase may be recovered and a 
liquid or gaseous phase containing methanol and 

dimethyl ether may be recovered. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 
wherein the membrane is substantially permeable to 

dimethyl ether and wherein the permeate containing 
methanol and at least a portion of the dimethyl 

ether is recovered. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
wherein the purified hydrocarbon mixture from the 

bottom of the distillation zone has a water content 
of less than 10 ppm by weight, preferably less than 

1 ppm by weight, a dimethyl ether concentration of 
less than 100 ppm, advantageously less than 50 ppm  

 
by weight, and a methanol concentration of less than 

50 ppm by weight, preferably less than 5 ppm by 
weight. 
Use of a process according to any one of claims 1 to 
8 in a process for the etherification of a 

hydrocarbon cut comprising olefin hydrocarbons 
containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms with methanol, in 

which said cut is reacted with the methanol in a 
reaction zone under suitable conditions, an effluent 

is recovered which contains the organic ethers such 
as MTBE or TAME, hydrocarbons and oxygenated 

compounds comprising methanol, water if present and 
dimethyl ether if present, distillation is carried 

out under suitable conditions to recover said ethers 
and said hydrocarbon mixture including said 

oxygenated compounds, said mixture is separated 
using the process described in any one of claims 1 

to 8, and at least a portion of the methanol-enriched 
permeate obtained is recycled to the 

reaction zone. 
Use according to claim 9 wherein distillation is 
carried out in a catalytic distillation
 zone and at  
 

least a portion of the permeate is optionally 
recycled to said catalytic distillation zone.
