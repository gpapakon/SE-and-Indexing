<DESCRIPTION>
Nanophase materials composed of nanosize particles are 
used in a variety of applications to produce a variety of products. 
The ceramic industry frequently utilizes nanophase 
solid state materials to produce ceramic based products. 
Nanosize materials are also useful in forming thin coatings 
for electronic and superconducting applications. Other uses 
of nanophase solid state materials include catalysts, 
superconductors and oxides for recording media. Such 
nanophase materials are particularly useful in these and other 
applications because they can be densified by various 
techniques resulting in high strength materials and materials 
containing a relatively high percentage of the densified 
material. Nanophase materials are also useful in the fabrication 
of electronic devices since small particles calcine at 
lower temperatures to form continuous structures. Co-precipitation processes are normally employed to manufacture 
such nanophase materials. The co-precipitation method, 
however, has the disadvantage of producing materials which 
are not exceptionally homogeneous and the reproducibility of 
the process is often poor and it is not a general process for 
the synthesis of nanophase materials. In addition, the 
materials produced by the conventional co-precipitation 
require relatively higher calcination temperatures to cause 
densification. Higher calcination temperatures are 
disadvantageous because they lead to higher defect 
concentrations resulting in decreased resistance to fracture. 
Gas phase processes have been used for synthesizing a few 
nanophase compounds. These processes are usually not suitable 
for general metal oxide syntheses. Moreover, production rates 
are very low. As a result, there is a need for a process to synthesize  
 
such materials generally which is both easily reproducible and 
which provides nanophase solid state materials for use as ceramics, 
catalysts, superconductors, electronic part coatings, 
and the like. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a process 
for producing nanophase solid state materials such as 
metal and metal oxide based materials, which is easily 
reproducible and results in materials having crystallite 
morphologies and particle sizes in the nanosize range of from 
about 1 to 30 nanometers. The process generally comprises the 
steps of: (A) pressurizing a metal-containing solution and a 
precipitating agent; (B) exerting high shear forces thereon 
to create nanosize particles; and (C) depressurizing the 
solution to cause

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing nanophase solid state 
materials from a metal-containing solution and a precipitating 

agent which comprises the steps of : (A) pressurizing a metal-containing 
solution and a precipitating agent, and (B) 

depressurizing the solution to cause precipitation of the 
nanophase solid state material, wherein high shear forces are 

exerted on said pressurized mixture of step (A) by causing two 
streams of the mixed solution to impinge upon each other while 

traveling at a velocity of at least 40 meters/second to form 
nanosize particles ranging in size from 1 to 1,000 nanometers. 
The process of Claim 1 which comprises (1) mixing together 
a metal containing solution and a second solution containing 

a precipitating agent to form a mixed solution, (2) 
pressurizing the mixed solution, (3) passing the mixed solution 

into a fluidizing apparatus wherein high shear forces act on the 
mixed solution, creating nanophase solid state materials having 

average particle sizes of from about 1 to 30 nm, (4) 
depressurizing the mixed solution sufficiently rapidly to cause 

cavitation, and (5) separating the nanophase solid state material 
from the cavitated mixed solution. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the mixed solution is 
pressurized to about 1,000 to 50,000 psig (6.9 to 344.8 MPa). 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the pressure is from 
about 18,000 to 50,000 psig (124.1 to 344.8 MPa). 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the metal containing 
solution and the precipitating agent containing solution are 

mixed prior to passage into the fluidizing apparatus. 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the mixed solution is 
recycled through the fluidizer apparatus.  

 
The process of Claim 6, wherein the precipitating agent 
solution is added to the mixed solution as it recycled. 
The process of Claim 2, wherein metal-containing solution 
is added to the mixed solution as it is recycled. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the metal-containing 
solution and the precipitating agent are mixed as they enter a 

pressurizing pump. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the metal-containing 
solution is a metal salt solution. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the average particle 
size is less than about 10 nm. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the average particle 
size is about 1 to 3 nm. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the solid state material 
is crystallized. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the metal-containing 
solution and the precipitating agent are mixed together in a 

separate vessel.
