Preparations for coloring keratin-containing fibers 
containing 


an alkyl glycoside corresponding to formula (I): 

R
1
 - O - [G]
x
 - H
 
in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl 
radical containing 12 to 16 carbon atoms, [G]
 is an 
anhydroglucose unit and x is a number of 1 to 2.5 

and preferably 1.1 to 1.6, 
an oxidation dye precursor and 
a water-based carrier. 
Preparations as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the alkyl glycoside corresponding to formula I is 

present in a quantity of 0.05 to 5% by weight and preferably 
in a quantity of 0.1 to 2.4% by weight, based on the 

coloring preparation as a whole. 
Preparations as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that an amphoteric or zwitterionic polymer is 

additionally present in a quantity of 0.02 to 5% by 
weight and preferably in a quantity of 0.1 to 2% by 

weight, based on the hair coloring preparation as a 
whole. 
Hair coloring preparations containing 

an alkyl glycoside corresponding to formula (I) in 
a quantity of 0.05 to 5% by weight and preferably in 

a quantity of 0.1 to 2.4% by weight, 
an oxidation dye precursor in a quantity of 0.01 to 
5% by weight, 
an amphoteric or zwitterionic polymer in a quantity 
of 0.02 to 5% by weight and preferably in a quantity 

of 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the coloring 
preparation as a whole, and
