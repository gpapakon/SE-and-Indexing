<ABSTRACT>
A distribution transformer has a wound magnetic core (50) of overall circular shape and 
rectangular cross-section with between two and four overall rectangular shape electric coils (20, 

30) extending through the core window. The coils (20, 30) are pre-formed and assembled so that 
their parts (20A, 30A) which meet form a circular section solid cylinder. A mandrel (40) is then 

located around this cylinder (20A, 30A) and continuous non-amorphous steel strip is wound 
thereon to form an unannealed, uncut wound magnetic core of axial length in the range 250mm 

to 1m.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical power distribution transformers. In particular the 
invention relates to such distribution transformers of the type which include a core and coil 
assembly having a wound magnetic core with a central window and one or more electric coils 
which extend through said core window. Two known transformer core and coil assemblie of the above-defined type, in which the 
core is of overall rectangular shape and methods of making them, will now be described. In the first such known assembly the wound core is made by winding magnetic steel strip 
of single width into a circular roll, and in winding each turn it is cut at approximately the same 
point. The circular roll is then pressed into an overall rectangular shape core having distributed 
gaps through one side of the rectangle where the turns were cut, and it is then annealed to fix the 
rectangular shape. The cut core turns are then opened up and bent out to form a U-shape, a preformed 
rectangular cylindrical coil is assembled on each of the two legs of the U-shape, and the 
cut core turns are then closed to re-form the rectangular core shape and are jointed. However 
well the cuts are jointed they will add significantly to the power loss of the core. Also with this 
method, the machinery for cutting the magnetic steel strip involves significant cost which is 
thereby reflected in the cost of the transformer. Furthermore the present and expected future 
trend is to use progressively thinner magnetic steel strip which has inherently lower power loss, 
but thinner strip is more difficult to handle in processes which involve cutting. Another 
disadvantage of this method is that the equipment and process involved in annealing the core  
 
contributes significantly to the cost of manufacturing the transformer and hence the cost of the 
transformer so made. In the second known assembly with a rectangular shape wound core transformer, magnetic 
steel strip of varying width is wound continuously without cuts on to a rectangular mandrel to 
form an overall rectangular shape core with an approximately circular cross-section. The core is 
then annealed to fix the rectangular shape. Split mandrels are then fitted over two legs of the core 
and a circular cylindrical coil is wound on to each mandrel. This second assembly avoids the 
manufacturing and power loss disadvantages associated with cutting in the above-described first 
assembly. However there is still the cost disadvantage of annealing the core. There are two 
further
