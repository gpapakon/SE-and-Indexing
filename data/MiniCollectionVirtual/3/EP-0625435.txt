<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a pneumatic tire having slant main 
grooves (3) extending from positions adjacent to a 

circumferential rib (2) in a tread center zone (4) 
toward each tread end in opposite directions to each 

other at a relatively small angle with respect to the 
circumferential direction of the tire. Each of the 

slant grooves extends at an angle of not more than 40째 
to the circumferential direction of the tire, and slant 

auxiliary grooves (6) are formed so as to extend at an 
angle of not less than 50째 with respect to the 

circumferential direction of the tire from the ends of 
the slant main grooves (3) to the tread end in each of 

tread side zones (5), and further the negative ratio of 
the tread (1) is maximized at the portion adjacent to 

the circumferential rib (2) and tends to be decreased 
towards the tread ends. 
By means of this invention the wet property is 
enhanced and the pattern noise is reduced without 

adversely affecting the primary functions of the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pneumatic tires, 
and in particular to high-performance pneumatic tires 
which are capable of enhancing wet performance and 
reducing pattern noise compatibly without adversely 
affecting the primary properties of the tire. In order to improve wet property and reduce pattern 
noise, for example, it is generally known to select a 
tread pattern having a combination of straight 
circumferential grooves and directional (uni-directional) 
slant grooves, as shown e.g. in DE-A-3 707 953. In this case, 
it is effective to increase the negative ratio, which is the 
ratio of total groove area to the sum of total groove 
area and total land area. However, since a conventional pattern comprising a 
combination of straight circumferential grooves and 
slant grooves has large circumferential groove portions 
and small slant groove portions, there is caused a 
problem that appropriate distribution of grooves across 
the tread in the widthwise direction of the tire is not 
obtained and hence drain efficiency is not effectively 
enhanced. Further when the negative ratio is increased 
to enhance the wet property, the land area is small and  
 
the necessary land rigidity is not retained, resulting 
in causing other problems of decreasing resistance to 
wear and cornering property, in addition to degrading 
pattern noise. The present invention has been accomplished based on 
the realization that directional slant grooves having a 
small slant angle with respect to the circumferential 
direction of the tire is advantageous with respect to 
wet property, while when only these slant grooves are 
arranged, it is difficult to retain sufficient land 
rigidity resulting in degraded steering stability and 
the effect on reducing noise by pitch-variation is small 
because of the decreased number of pitches. Objects of the present invention are to provide a 
pneumatic tire having enhanced wet property and 
effectively reduced pattern noise without degrading 
primary functions such as steering stability and 
resistance to wear by selecting the position and angle 
of such slant grooves, combining other slant grooves 
having selected position, angle and width with these 
slant grooves, and defining the distribution of the 
negative ratio across the tread in the widthwise 
direction of the tread. According to the invention, there is provided a 
pneumatic tire having a tread pattern comprising a  
 
circumferential rib extending continuously in the 
circumferential direction of the tire in a tread

circumferential rib (2) extending continuously in the 

circumferential direction of the tire in a tread center 
zone (4), defined by having a half width of the tread 

width and extending on both sides of the equatorial 
plane of the tire as the middle plane, and slant main 

grooves (3) extending from positions adjacent to the
