Each roller (7) is mounted by means of bearings 
(36) on a shaft beam (30) integral with the stator (42) 

of the electric motor, while the rotor (50) of said 
electric motor extends in annular form around the stator 

(42) and is integral with the peripheral shell (7B) of 
the roller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a machine for fabric treatment 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a machine is known from EP-A-0519884. According to 
this known machine, each roller 
has within it an electric motor, which is located with 
its axis orthogonal to that of the roller and which 
drives the roller through a very highly geared step-down 
system; use must generally be made of a ring bevel gear 
integral and coaxial with the roller, engaged with a 
bevel gear sprocket driven by the motor at a rate previously 
reduced through cylindrical gearing. This 
solution is relatively expensive, requires lubrication 
inside the roller, and has certain difficulties with 
respect to cooling, since there is no dissipation of heat 
directly from the motor to the outside. These disadvantages are overcome by the present 
invention, also has other objects which will be 
made clear in the following text, by means of the features set 
forth in claim 1. The machine for treating fabric in "cord" form, 
to which the invention relates, may be a fulling machine 
or other similar machine, and may be of the type consisting 
of one or more sections, each comprising a pair of 
hollow rotating rollers which interact to engage the 
fabric and make it pass between them, each roller containing 
an electric motor to provide the rotary drive. 
According to the invention, one roller or each roller is 
mounted by means of bearings on a shaft beam; said shaft 
beam is integral with the stator of the electric motor, 
While the rotor of said electric motor extends in annular  
 
form around the stator and is integral with the peripheral 
shell of the roller, which is driven directly by 
the motor. Said shaft beam may advantageously have passages 
at the sides of the stator for the circulation of a 
cooling fluid - particularly air - which is directed into 
the cavity of the roller and is removed from this cavity. 
The shaft beam may have an axial through hole, with an 
intermediate plug flanked by radial passages for the 
circulation of the cooling fluid - such as air, in 
particular - these passages opening at the sides of the 
stator. Generally, the stator, carried by the shaft beam, 
has through holes for the circulation of the cooling 
fluid - such as air - from one side of the stator to the 
other side. One of the two rollers of each pair may be 
carried by movable arms, and in this case the cooling 
fluid - particularly air - is made to circulate through 
said movable arms, which are hollow, with a feed through 
a flexible

<CLAIMS>
A fabric treating machine for treating fabrics 
in cord form, such as in particular a fulling machine, 

consisting of one or more sections, each section 
comprising two hollow rotating rollers (7, 11) defining a 

nip through which a cord fabric (T) to be treated is 
advanced, one or each roller being mounted by means of 

bearings (36) on a shaft beam (30) and containing an 
electric motor (42, 50) to provide a rotary drive, 


characterized in that
: said shaft beam (30) is integral 
with the stator (42) of the electric motor; and the rotor 

(50) of said electric motor extends in annular form around 
the stator (42) and is integral with the peripheral shell 

(7B) of the roller (7, 11).  
 
The machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
shaft beam (30) has passages (32) at the sides of the 

stator (42) for the circulation of a cooling fluid - particularly air - which is directed into the cavity (S) 
of the roller. 
The machine as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
shaft beam (30) has an axial through hole (32), with an 

intermediate plug (34) flanked by radial passages (32A 
and 32B) for the circulation of the cooling fluid - such 

as air - these passages opening at the sides of the 
stator. 
The machine as claimed in any preceding claims, 
wherein the stator (42) carried by the shaft beam (30) 

has through holes (44) for the circulation of the cooling 
fluid - such as air - from one side of the stator to the 

other side. 
The machine as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein one (11) of the two rollers (7, 11) is 

carried by movable arms (13), and wherein the cooling 
fluid - such as air - is made to circulate through said 

movable arms (13) which are hollow and which are connected 
to flexible supply ducts.
