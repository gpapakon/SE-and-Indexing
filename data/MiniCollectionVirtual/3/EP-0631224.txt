<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for efficiently reading and processing 
multiple data blocks stored in a removable data storage medium within 

a data storage system, wherein each data block includes a header 
portion containing selected parameters necessary to identify and 

process an associated data block, and a data portion. Each data block 
is accessed within the removable data storage medium utilizing track 

logic circuitry and then coupled to a data block buffer for temporary 
storage. A header processing logic circuit is interposed between the 

track logic circuitry and the data block buffer and is utilized to 
initiate processing of only the header portion of each data block prior 

to storage of the data block within the data block buffer. After 
completion of processing of the header portion of a data block and 

completion of storage of that data block within the data block buffer, 
the data block is efficiently processed utilizing selected parameters 

contained within the header portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to improved data 
storage systems and in particular to a method and system for enhancing 
the efficiency of data block processing within a data storage system. 
Still more particularly the present invention relates to an improved 
method and system for initiating processing of a header portion of each 
data block prior to transfer of the associated data block into a data 
block buffer. Modern data processing systems often use digital signal 
recording devices attached to host processors to record records as 
addressable units within magnetic tape storage systems. Examples of systems which may be utilized to record records 
within a magnetic tape storage system are disclosed within Milligan et 
al., U.S. Patent No. 4,393,445; Milligan et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,435,762; Videki II, U.S. Patent No. 4,471,457; Cole et al., U.S. 
Patent No. 4,603,382; Bauer et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,423,480; and Fry 
et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,403,286. Each of the aforementioned patents 
discloses a magnetic tape storage system which may be advantageously 
employed in carrying out the method and system of the present 
invention. The records stored within such a magnetic tape storage 
system are typically recorded as addressable units which comprise a 
block of signals recorded on magnetic tape in a manner set forth within 
the above-referenced patents. Each such data block on a tape is 
separated from an adjacent data block by a so-called inter-block gap 
(IBG) which may comprise an erased portion to the tape, a tone or other 
special symbol denoting the presence of an inter-block gap. In early data storage systems, such inter-block gaps may be 
quite long; however, as system development has resulted in higher and 
higher data capacity and native data rate capability within storage 
subsystems, the inter-block gap has been substantially decreased in 
duration. As a result, the decisions and processing of data blocks 
which are read from tape in a data storage system must be accomplished 
within this increasingly smaller gap between consecutive data blocks, 
resulting in much greater demands on the processing hardware.  Each data block within such a data storage system typically 
includes both a data portion and a header portion which contains all 
information needed to identify and process a particular block of data. 
Normally, this information may be utilized to determine the "type" of 
data block, whether or not the current data block is a copy of a 
previously read data block,
