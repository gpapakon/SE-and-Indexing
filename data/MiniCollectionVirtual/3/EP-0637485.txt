<ABSTRACT>
A screw holding and driving device for use with powered 
drills including a slidable transparent sleeve (14) mounted in 

concentric relation with a screw drive shaft (12) of the device. The 
sleeve (14) is provided with an internal surface that is fluted with 

the fluted surfaces extending parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the cylindrically shaped sleeve (14). The inner surfaces with 

larger radii (30) remain clear of the shaft (12) and thus will not be 
scratched as the shaft (12) moves relative to the sleeve (14). Further, a 

split ring (40) of oval construction is provided for holding the 
sleeve on the shaft. The ends of the split oval retaining ring (40) 

are sized to fit in a groove (26) on the shaft and thus do not extend 
outside the groove (26) to scratch the transparent sleeve (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screw 
holding and driving tool which has a transparent 
sleeve to permit a user to see a screw and screwdriver 
bit as the screw is being driven with a powered drill. In United States Patent No. 4,736,658 there is 
described a screw holding and driving device having a 
shank secured at one end to a handle and a screw 
driving bit mounted at a second end of the shank. A 
sleeve is positioned in surrounding relation to the 
shank and sized to slidably rotate around the shank 
and to slidably move in a longitudinal direction with 
respect to the shank. The sleeve is used to hold a 
screw head during the driving operation. Retaining 
means are provided to hold the sleeve on the shank. Also, there is available a screw holding and 
driving tool having a drive shaft with a shank at one 
end to be  
 
received by a chuck of a powered drill and with a socket at the 
other end for receiving a socket bit. An opaque sleeve is 
positioned in surrounding relation to the driver shaft and is 
sized to slidably rotate around the shank and to slidably move in 
a longitudinal direction with respect to the shank. This tool is 
being marketed under the tradename FINDER/DRIVER. A problem has arisen in that an operator can neither see the 
position of the screw nor easily determine the angle, speed, or 
depth that the screw is driven when driving a screw into a work 
piece. A simple substitution of transparent materials for the 
opaque outer sleeve has proved ineffective because the stationary 
sleeve gets scratched as the drive shank rotates to drive a 
screw. In addition, conventional split retaining rings used with 
screw holding and driving devices for holding the sleeve on the 
shank have exposed ends that scratch the inner surfaces of the 
sleeve as the drive shank rotates or when the sleeve is moved 
from the extended to the retracted position or vice versa. The 
combination of scratching from the rotation of the shank inside 
the sleeve, and the scratching from the extension and retraction 
of the sleeve has made it impossible to make a simple 
substitution of materials. A need exists for a screw holding and driving device having 
a transparent sleeve which will resist scratching. Further, a 
need exists for a retaining device, used to hold the sleeve on 
the shank, constructed so as to operate without scratching the  
 
sleeve as the shank is rotated, or as the sleeve is extended or 
retracted. The present invention relates to a screw holding and driving 
device for use with powered

<CLAIMS>
A screw holding and driving device (10) for use with a 
power drill and with conventional socket bits (20), the device 

comprising: 

a shaft (12) having a socket (18) at one end thereof for receiving the 
socket bit (20) and a shank (16) at the other end thereof to be received by 

the power drill; 
a sleeve (14) having an internal diameter sized to 
slidably rotate on the shaft; and 
the sleeve being adapted to be positioned on the shaft in 
surrounding relation to the shaft (12); characterized in that 
the sleeve is transparent and has a fluted interior surface 
(28, 30). 
A device according to claim 1 wherein the sleeve (14) is movable 
from a fully extended position to a fully retracted position and 

further including a first stop means (26, 40, 31) for preventing the sleeve 
from sliding away from the shaft (12) when the sleeve is moved to the 

fully extended position. 
A device according to claim 2 further including a second stop 
means (24, 38) for preventing the sleeve from sliding off the shaft when 

the sleeve is moved to the fully retracted position. 
A device according to claim 3 wherein the first stop means 
includes: 


a stop groove (26) formed on the shaft adjacent the socket (20);  
 
a compressible split oval retaining ring (40), positioned in and 
being held within the stop groove (26), the oval retaining ring (40) having 

a major axis and a minor axis; 
the oval retaining ring further being sized to have its 
major axis larger than the internal diameter (28) of the sleeve; 
a bevelled groove (31) formed on the sleeve adjacent the end 
corresponding with the socket end of the shaft for releaseably 

receiving the oval retaining ring; and 
the oval retaining ring (40) having the split ends formed 
adjacent a minor axis and positioned within the stop groove (26). 
A device according to claim 4 wherein the bevelled groove (31) is 
bounded with a stop wall (34) on the side closest the drill end 

corresponding with the drill end of the shaft; and 

the bevelled groove (31) is bounded on the other side with an 
inclined surface (33) inclined inwa
rdly with respect to the sleeve and 
toward an end of the sleeve corresponding with the socket end of 

the shaft. 
A device according to claim 5 wherein the second stop means 
includes: 


a retraction stop groove (24) formed on the shaft adjacent the 
drill end; and 
a circular stop ring (38) positioned within the retraction stop 
groove (24) and sized when positioned in the retraction stop groove to  

 
have an outside diameter larger than the internal diameter (28) of the 

sleeve. 
A device according to claim 6 further including a ring collar 
means (32), attached inside an end of the sleeve corresponding with 

the socket end of the shaft, for protecting this end of the 
sleeve from abrasion; 


the ring collar (32) is sized to slide over the shaft.
