<ABSTRACT>
A device for suspending a squeegee in a cylindrical 
screen (1) of a rotary screen printing machine, in which 

the cylindrical screen is accommodated with both ends in 
drive and support units, and in which the squeegee extends 

in the lengthwise direction inside the cylindrical screen, 
comprises two squeegee supports, each disposed near one of 

the drive and support units, and each provided with an 
accommodation opening for the accommodation of one end of 

the squeegee. At the side facing the inside of the 
cylindrical screen (1), one of the squeegee supports (10) 

is provided with a guide element (13) for guiding an end of 
a squeegee into the accommodation opening (12) when the 

squeegee is being mounted in the cylindrical screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for suspending a 
squeegee in a cylindrical screen of a rotary screen 
printing machine, in which the cylindrical screen is 
accommodated with both ends in drive and support units, and 
the squeegee extends in the lengthwise direction inside the 
cylindrical screen, which device comprises two squeegee 
supports, each disposed near one of the drive and support 
units, and each provided with an accommodation opening for 
the accommodation of one end of the squeegee. Such a device is known in practice. In rotary screen printing machines colour paste is 
supplied by means of a squeegee to a cylindrical screen. 
The squeegee consists of a distribution system for 
distributing the colour paste over the width of the 
squeegee and a squeegee blade which serves to force colour 
paste through the screen. In the case of the known device, when the squeegee 
is being mounted in a screen suspended in the drive and 
support unit, the squeegee is slid into the cylindrical 
screen from one side, following which the ends of the 
squeegee are mounted in the accommodation openings of the 
two squeegee supports disposed near the ends of the 
cylindrical screen. The known device for suspending a squeegee has the 
disadvantage that the squeegee has to be mounted by two 
people, one on each side of the cylindrical screen. The 
first person slides the squeegee, which can be 3 to 3.5 
metres long, into the cylindrical screen from one side. 
When the squeegee has been slid fully into the cylindrical 
screen, the second person, at the other side of the 
cylindrical screen, picks up the end of the squeegee slid 
through the screen and fixes it in the squeegee support 
situated at the side in question. The first person then 
fixes the other end of the squeegee in the appropriate 
squeegee support. During the mounting of the squeegee the  
 
two people often have to assume an awkward position and 
lift quite a heavy weight. In addition, there is the danger 
that when the squeegee is being mounted in the squeegee 
supports, the squeegee could fall and damage the screen. The object of the invention is to provide a device 
for suspending a squeegee in a cylindrical screen of a 
rotary screen printing machine, in which the squeegee can 
be mounted in the cylindrical screen in a simple way by one 
person. This object is achieved according to the invention 
by a device of the type mentioned in the preamble, which is 
characterized in that at the side facing the inside of the 
cylindrical screen one of the

<CLAIMS>
Device for suspending a squeegee in a cylindrical 
screen of a rotary screen printing machine, in which the 

cylindrical screen (1) is accommodated with both ends (2,3) 
in drive and support units (4,5), and the squeegee (6) 

extends in the lengthwise direction inside the cylindrical 
screen, which device comprises two squeegee supports 

(9,10), each disposed near one of the drive and support 
units, and each provided with an accommodation opening for 

the accommodation of one end (7,8) of the squeegee, 

characterized in that
 at the side facing the inside of the 
cylindrical screen (1) one (10) of the squeegee supports is 

provided with a guide element (13) for guiding one end of a 
squeegee (6) into the accommodation opening (12) during 

mounting of the squeegee in the cylindrical screen. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the guide element consists of a channel-shaped spoon (13) 

which in an initial position, in which no squeegee end is 
situated in the accommodation opening (12) of the squeegee 

support (10), extends from the inside surface of the 
cylindrical screen to the accommodation opening. 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the channel-shaped spoon (13) is rotatable about an axis of 

rotation (19) which is situated at the underside of the 
accommodation opening in the squeegee support and intersects 

the axis (20) of the accommodation opening (12) at 
right angles. 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 
the channel-shaped spoon (13) has an extension piece (24) 

extending past the axis of rotation (19) of the spoon, and 
in the initial position of the channel-shaped spoon extending 

until it is inside the accommodation opening.
