<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a case part (2), which consists of plastic and has at least one push-button switch (4, 4'), in the case of which a switch cap (5) which acts as a resetting element and consists of an injection-moulded plastic compound or the like is arranged. The switch cap (5) has a baseplate (6), which is mounted on the case part (2), and a cover (7), which is used as an operating device to bridge stationary contacts, as well as a thin-walled, flexible diaphragm (8) which connects the baseplate (6) and the cover (7). The switch cap (5) is injection-moulded into the case part (2) which is used as a mould, there being no firm connection to the case part (2), at least in the region of the diagraphm (8) and of the cover (7) of the switch cap (5).
