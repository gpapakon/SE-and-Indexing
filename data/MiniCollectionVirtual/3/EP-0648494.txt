<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises novel oral rapamycin formulations which 
contain about 0.01 to about 10.0 grams of rapamycin per each 100 ml of the formulation, 

and a solvent system comprising from about 0.1 to about 10 % by volume of surfactant, 
from about 0 to about 25 % by volume of inert solvent, and from about 65 to about 99.95 

% by volume of a lecithin or phospholipid solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to formulations containing rapamycin, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of rapamycin, which are useful in oral administrations
for inducing immunosuppression and for treating transplantation rejection, host vs.
graft disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation, solid tumors, fungal
infections, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas and hyperproliferative vascular disorders.
This invention also relates to processes for preparing such compositions.Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus
which was discovered first for its properties as an antifungal agent. It adversely affects
the growth of fungi such as Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum. Rapamycin,
its preparation and its antibiotic activity were described in U.S. Patent No. 3,929,992,
issued December 30, 1975 to Surendra Sehgal et al. In 1977 Martel, R. R. et al.
reported on immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin against experimental allergic
encephalitis and adjuvant arthritis in the Canadian Journal of Physiological
Pharmacology, 55, 48-51 (1977). In 1989, Calne, R. Y. et al. in Lancet, 1989, no. 2,
p. 227 and Morris, R. E. and Meiser, B. M. in Medicinal Science Research, 1989, No.
17, P. 609-10, separately reported on the effectiveness of rapamycin in inhibiting
rejection in vivo in allograft transplantation. Numerous articles have followed
describing the immunosuppressive and rejection inhibiting properties of rapamycin, and
clinical investigations have begun for the use of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in
transplantation in man.Rapamycin alone (U.S. Patent 4,885,171) or in combination with picibanil
(U.S. Patent 4,401,653) has been shown to have antitumor activity. R. Martel et al.
[Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48 (1977)] disclosed that rapamycin is effective in
the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model, a model for multiple sclerosis; in the
adjuvant arthritis model, a model for rheumatoid arthritis; and effectively inhibited the
formation of IgE-like antibodies.The immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin have been disclosed in FASEB 3,
3411 (1989). Cyclosporin A and FK-506, other macrocyclic molecules, also have
been shown to be effective as immunosuppressive agents, therefore useful in 
preventing transplant rejection [FASEB 3, 3411 (1989); FASEB 3, 5256 (1989); R.
Y. Calne et al., Lancet 1183 (1978); and U.S. Patent 5,100,899].Rapamycin has also been shown to be useful in preventing or treating systemic
lupus erythematosus [U.S. Patent 5,078,999], pulmonary
