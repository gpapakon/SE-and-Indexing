<DESCRIPTION>
 DNA Sequences Encoding the Human Al, A2a and A2b Adenosine Receptors Field-of the InventionThe present invention relates to DNA sequences encoding the human Al, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of these DNA sequences in the production of the human Al, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors using recombinant DNA technology. Background of the InventionAdenosine influences cardiovascular function (by- slowing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure) and also influences nervous system function (through sedative and anti-epileptic effects). In addition, adenosine can induce bronchoconstriction. Adenosine binds specifically to at least three receptors, Al and A2a and A2b. Adenosine receptors have been shown to couple to a number of second messenger systems. Additional adenosine receptor subtypes may exist. As adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists may have commercial value as anti-hypertensive agents, hypnotics, anti-psychotics c d bronchodilators, the ability to produce adenosine receptors by recombinant DNA technology is advantageous. The present inventors have isolated three related cDNA fragments encoding the human Al, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors from human hippocampal cDNA by using either the. polymerase chain reaction and unique degenerate oligonucleotides to generate specific probes or by using specific consensus oligonucleotide probes for cDNA library screening. Full-length cDNA clones for each of the three receptors were isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library. The receptor sequences were identified as the human Al, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors by expression in mammalian cells and both measurement of the affinity of the encoded receptors for various adenosine analogues andSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

the effect of receptor activation on cAMP synthesis. The receptors have homology to cDNA's encoding the dog Al and A2a adenosine receptors (MAENHAUT, C, VAN SANDE, J., LIBERT, F., ADRAMO IC, . , PARMENTIER, M., VANDERHAEGEN, J. , DUMONT, D. , VASSART, G. ANDSCHIFFMANN, S. (1990); LIBERT, F., SCHUFFMANN, S.M., LEFORT, A., PARMENTIER, M. , GERARD, C, DUMONT, J.E., VANDERHAEGHEN J.J., VASSART, G. (1991)) and the rat A2b adenosine receptor (STEHLE, J.H., RIVKEES, S.A., LEE, J.J., WEAVER, D.R., DEEDS, J.D. AND REPPERT, S.M.(1992)). These hippocampal cDNA sequences represent novel human receptors which may be of clinical and commercial importance. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention consists in a DNA molecule
