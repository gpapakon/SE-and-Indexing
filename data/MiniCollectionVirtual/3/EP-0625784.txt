<ABSTRACT>
A shielded electrical cable (10) for transmission of 
electrical signals in which very fine wires or light-weight 

foils are used as shielding materials (7). The shielding 
materials (7) are held in place by an adhesive (5) to 

prevent dislodgement or misalignment of the shielding 
materials (7) by forces exerted upon them during subsequent 

manufacturing steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to coaxial electrical cables for electrical
signal transmission, and more particularly to coaxial cables using
lightweight metallic materials for shielding against extraneous
electromagnetic radiation.A coaxial electrical cable for high speed transmission of electric
signals generally comprises a metallic inner conductor surrounded by a
dielectric insulating material, which in turn is surrounded by an
electrically-conductive outer material that provides a shield against
passage of extraneous external electrical signals or noise which might
interfere with signals carried by the inner conductor, or against passage
of signals or noise generated by the inner conductor. Generally, a third
layer of dielectric material surrounds the coaxial assembly which
provides a sheath or jacket for protection against the use environment
and to provide additional insulation. Coaxial electrical cables
comprising the elements described above in single layers or in multiple
coaxial layers are well known in the art.As industry trends toward smaller and lighter weight coaxial cables
formed of generally circular sequential layers of materials problems
have arisen which are difficult to meet with currant art without sacrificing
desirable properties. One such problem is the maintenance of the
position and alignment of the shielding materials during subsequent
manufacturing steps. This can also be the case in the manufacture of
coaxial cables having asymmetric shapes and other non-circular cross-section
shapes.Shielding materials may include metals or metallized plastic film in
the form of wire, tape, or foil which are conventionally applied to
surround a dielectric materiai layer by methods such as braiding,
serving (helical wrapping), or folding (cigarette-style wrap). These 
materials are generally applied so that about 80% or more of the
dielectric material surface is uniformly covered by the material in order to
provide uniform shielding. If the shielding material is dislodged or its
alignment distorted shielding effectiveness is reduced and the cable may
be unusable.In most cases in which wire, tape, or foil shielding materials are
used the materials are sufficiently strong that they can be applied with
enough back tension so that, once in place, they can resist the forces
exerted on them by subsequent manufacturing steps and remain in
place. However, when very fine wire or thin foils and tapes are used it
is difficult to apply them to the surface of the dielectric material in a
manner that resists
