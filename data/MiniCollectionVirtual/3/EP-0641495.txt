<ABSTRACT>
A close-fitting box (110, 120, Fig. 3) maintains a sheet (100) of mastic in sheet form for wrapping around a cable splice (Fig. 7) to supply large volume of mastic to fill the enclosure formed by applying a heat-shrinkable sleeve (250, Fig. 11) around the mastic-wrapped splice.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cable-sealing mastic material, by which is meant a mastic or 
similar material which is capable of use for sealing cables; and to a kit of parts for cable 
sealing including such material; and to methods of cable sealing using such material. It is known to seal cables in order to prevent water or other fluids from travelling 
along inside the cable, and especially to prevent ingress of water into cable joints, splices or 
terminations, where bare electrical connections are usually present. Relatively free-flowing 
materials may be squeezed or pumped into the cable for this purpose, for example as 
described in GB-A-2100281; free-pouring curable resins are known for filling cable splices. 
DE-A-3327821 describes cable splice seals comprising pads of greasy sealant wrapped in 
foil which serves as a backing when the pad is pressed against a cable splice. FR-A-2624665 
describes cable-sealing mastic material of sufficiently high viscosity to keep its 
shape under ambient conditions. High viscosity hot melt materials have been used, for 
example as described in GB-B-2097203. The high viscosity hot melt materials are 
conveniently provided on the inner surface of a heat-recoverable sleeve used to seal a cable 
joint. This is very successful in joints where the amount free space to be filled by the hot 
melt material is relatively small and of relatively uniform diameter, as illustrated in the 
aforementioned GB-B-2097203. However, this technique is unsatisfactory where larger 
volumes of irregular diameter must be filled, since it is difficult or impossible to heat the 
necessary large volume of hot melt material sufficiently for adequate flow without 
overheating and damaging the heat-recoverable sleeve. The present invention provides cable-sealing material in an unusual form which 
overcomes or alleviates this difficulty and is more convenient to use than the known 
alternatives of pumping or pouring flowable materials into the cable.  
 The invention accordingly provides a combination of a cable-sealing mastic material 
inherently capable of significant creeping flow in storage, which material is in sheet form, 
and a close-fitting storage container therefor, which container (a) is arranged to resist the 
said flow in all directions and so maintains the material substantially in the said sheet form 
in storage, and (b) is lined or provided with other means to permit removal therefrom of the 
material substantially still in the said sheet form. We have discovered that provision of

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a cable-sealing mastic material inherently capable of significant 
creeping flow in storage, which material is in sheet form, and a close-fitting storage 

container therefor, which container (a) is arranged to resist the said flow in all directions 
and so maintains the material substantially in the said sheet form in storage, and (b) is lined 

or provided with other means to permit removal therefrom of the material substantially still 
in the said sheet form. 
Combination according to claim 1, wherein the structure of the container is arranged 
to permit application of the material substantially still in the said sheet form and still in the 

container to parts of a cable to be sealed by the said material in use. 
Combination according to claim 1 or 2, having a low-adhesion release foil in contact 
with at least one of the main sheet surfaces of the mastic material. 
Combination according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the inner surface of the container 
is at least partly covered with low-adhesion release material. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the container encloses one 
or more space fillers arranged to occupy any free space between the mastic material and the 

inner surface of the container. 
Combination according to claim 5, having a space filler overlying substantially all of 
one of the main sheet surfaces of the mastic material. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the container is a flat box 
ha
ving (a) a base of a size and shape to support one of the main sheet surfaces of the mastic 
material, (b) sides upstanding from the base to a height at least equal to, preferably  

 
exceeding by up to 100%, the sheet thickness of the mastic material, and (c) a removable 

lid fitting over at least part of the sides so as to enclose the mastic material. 
Combination according to claim 7, wherein the sides extend from the base and are 
arranged to be folded down towards the plane of the base to expose the sheet edges of the 

mastic material. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the sheet length and sheet 
breadth of the mastic material are each at least 10 times, preferably at least 20 times, more 

preferably at least 30 times, the sheet thickness. 
Combination according to claim 9, wherein the sheet thickness is at least 0.5 
centimetre, preferably at least 1 centimetre. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the mastic material is in 
substantially continuous flat sheet form in the container. 
Combination according to claim 11, wherein the mastic material is in the form of a single unfolded sheet in the 
container. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the mastic material has a 
viscosity at room temperature greater than 4000 Pa.s. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the mastic material has a 
viscosity at 70°C within the range from 500 Pa.s. to 4000 Pa.s. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the mastic material has 
sufficient non-resilient flexibility to be wrapped around a radius of 12 (preferably 8)  

 
centimetres at a temperature above 0°C (preferably above -10°C) substantially without any 

spontaneous unwrapping. 
Combination according to any preceding claim, wherein the mastic material 
comprises a blend of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and polyisobutylene. 
Combination according to claim 16, wherein the mastic material comprises 20 to 
40% by weight of the ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and 80 to 60% by weight of the 

polyisobutylene, based on the total weight of those two polymers.

enclosure. 
A method of sealing a cable, wherein sheet mastic material from a combination 
according to any of claims 1 to 17 is wrapped around exposed internal components of the 

cable, preferably after removal of the mastic sheet from the said container, and a heat-recoverable
