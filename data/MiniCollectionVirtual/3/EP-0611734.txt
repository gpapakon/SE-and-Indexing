<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foaming agent used for the 
production of light-weight gypsum plaster boards. In particular, the 
present invention relates to a foaming agent capable of forming stable, 
uniform foams and thereby suitable for the production of light-weight 
gypsum plaster boards. Gypsum plaster boards are usually produced by pouring a calcined 
gypsum slurry between an upper base paper and a lower base paper, 
passing the resultant product through a shaping apparatus to 
continuously shape it into a plate having a predetermined width and 
thickness, curing the plate, roughly cutting it, drying the obtained 
pieces and cutting them into a predetermined size of the final product; 
the calcined gypsum slurry being obtained by mixing a calcined gypsum 
(obtained by calcining a natural gypsum and/or chemical gypsum), an 
adhesion assistant, a curing accelerator, foams and other additives 
with water. The foams used are obtained by dissolving a foaming agent 
in water, feeding the resultant solution into a foaming apparatus and 
mixing the solution with air under suitable conditions. It is usually 
understood that when relatively large spherical foams are evenly 
dispersed in the cured gypsum (core) containing the additives, the  
 
light-weight gypsum plaster boards having a high adhesion between the 
core and the base papers and a high core strength are obtained. Therefore, it has been demanded to develop a foaming agent 
capable of forming long-lasting stable foams satisfying the above-described 
requirements. The best foaming agents for the production of 
the light-weight gypsum plaster boards have been sulfates of higher 
alcohols or of ethylene oxide adducts of the higher alcohols in the 
prior art. Varieties of the most suitable alcohol compounds of these 
kinds and addition molar numbers of ethylene oxide were proposed. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,156,615 proposes sodium or 
ammonium salts of sulfated ethylene oxide (1.5 to 2.5 mol) adducts of 
higher alcohols comprising at least 90 % of those having 8 to 10 carbon 
atoms. Japanese Patent Unexamined Published Application (hereinafter 
referred to as "J.P. KOKAI") No. Hei 4-505601 proposes sulfuric ester 
salts (sodium or ammonium salts) of ethylene oxide (0.4 to 1.3 mol) 
adducts of the same higher alcohols as those described above. J.P. 
KOKAI No. Hei 3-23508 proposes sulfuric ester salts (sodium or ammonium 
salts) of ethylene oxide (1 to 3.5 mol) adducts of mixtures of (1) 
higher alcohols having 8 to 10 carbon atoms in which
