<ABSTRACT>
A synergistic cleaning composition has been 
discovered comprising an aqueous solution of a 

quaternary ammonium compound component; a nonionic 
surfactant component; and a glycol ether solvent. 

Surprisingly, the combination of the quaternary 
ammonium compound component, the nonionic surfactant 

component, and glycol ether solvent provides a 
synergistic effect where the cleaning composition 

functions with a low level of quaternary ammonium 
compound component while still maintaining at least one 

of the following desirable properties, as follows: an 
acceptable cleaning efficacy; a low level irritation or 

toxicity profile; and/or a broad spectrum antimicrobial 
activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an all purpose
cleaner particularly useful for cleaning hard surfaces.It is well known in the art to employ
quaternary ammonium compounds in cleaning compositions. A combination of quaternary ammonium compounds is disclosed in US-A-4 464 398.
Quaternary ammonium compounds are good antimicrobial
agents but may produce undue irritation to eyes or skin
at levels required to impart germicidal properties. In
addition, quaternary ammonium compounds and other types
of cationic compounds have been demonstrated, at times,
to interfere and reduce the cleaning efficiency of hard
surface cleaning compositions.US-A-4 597 887 describes a hard surface cleaning
composition comprising quaternary ammonium compounds, an
ethoxylated nonionic detergent and glycol ethers. The
nonionic detergent can include ethylene oxide adducts
of aliphatic alcohols. EP-A-0 275 987 describes
compositions for cleaning gas turbine compressors
including glycol ethers, ethylene oxide adducts of
aliphatic alcohols and a cationic surfactant which may
be a quaternary ammonium compound. US-A-4 065 409
discloses hard surface detergent compositions including
an amine oxide and an ethoxylated alcohol.It would be highly desirable to reduce the
level of quaternary ammonium compound(s) in cleaning
compositions while still achieving the
following characteristics: a broad spectrum
antimicrobial activity; an acceptable level of eye or
skin irritation; and an acceptable cleaning efficacy.A synergistic cleaning composition has been
discovered 
as defined in claim 1. Preferred compositions are defined in dependent claims 2-8.A novel method for the cleaning of particles
of soil from hard surfaces has also been discovered
comprising the steps of preparing a cleaning
composition as described above; diluting the
composition with up to 500 parts by weight water; and
contacting the diluted cleaning compositions with a
hard surface thereby removing soil particles.Surprisingly, the combination of the
quaternary ammonium compound component, the nonionic
surfactant component, and glycol ether solvent 
employed within the stated amounts has been found to
provide a synergistic effect. This cleaning
composition functions with a low level of quaternary
ammonium compound component while still maintaining
the following desirable properties: an
acceptable cleaning efficacy; an acceptable level
irritation or toxicity profile; and a broad spectrum
antimicrobial activity.Quaternary ammonium compounds to be used in the combination defined in claim 1
