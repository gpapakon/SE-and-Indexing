<CLAIMS>
A method of fixating a shaft (3) axially in its bearing 
casing (2) in wiper installations, in particular for 

cleaning the windscreen of an automotive vehicle, with the 
portion (11) of the shaft (3) which axially projects out 

of the bearing casing (2) being provided with an annular 
groove (14),
 
characterized in that after insertion and, possibly, after 

alignment of the shaft (3) in its bearing casing (2), 
the annular groove (14) is at least sectionally 

injection-moulded around with a plastified plastic 
material (12) or metal. 
A method as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the shaft (3) is heated before 

injection moulding, in particular up to a temperature of 
200°C ± 30°C. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2,
 
characterized in that the plastic material (12) or the 

metal is injected axially and/or radially onto the portion 
(11). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that different plastic materials (12) or 

metals are injected onto the portion (11) simultaneously 
or in succession. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that, during injection moulding, the  

 
portion (11) is at least partially embraced and/or 

overlapped by means of a tool so that a hollow space is 
formed between the tool and the portion (11). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the plastic material (12) or the 

metal is at least partially injected around the axial end 
(10) of the bearing casing (2). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the plastic material (12) or the 

metal is injected into recesses provided on the outside of 
the axial end (10) of the bearing casing (2). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the shaft (3) is fixated by means of 

an additional tool with regard to the bearing casing (2) 
until the plastic material (12) or the metal has cured or 

permanently hardened. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the annular gap (15) existing 

between the shaft (3) and the bearing casing (2) is sealed 
at least during injection moulding. 
A wiper assembly, manufactured in particular in accordance 
with a method of the preceding claims, and used in 

particular for cleaning the windscreen of an automotive 
vehicle, comprising: a drive mechanism and a linkage 

coupled to the drive mechanism, the drive mechanism and/or 
the linkage being provided with at least one rotating or  

 
swinging shaft (3) supported in a casing (2), and the 

shaft (3) at least unilaterally rising above the casing 
(2) by means of a shaft portion (11), and with the shaft 

portion (11) being provided with an annular groove (14), 
characterized in that the annular groove (14) is at least 

sectionally injection-moulded around with a plastic 
material (12) or metal. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in claim 10,
 
characterized in that the plastic material (12) or the 

metal is provided with the addition of a lubricant. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in claim 10 or in claim 11,
 
characterized in that the shaft portion (11) has several 

annular grooves (14), in particular four annular grooves 
(14). 
A wiper assembly as claimed in claim 12,
 
characterized in that the width of the annular grooves 

(14) exceeds the width of the spacings between them. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 13,
 
characterized in that the annular groove (14) has rounded 

internal edges. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 14,
 
characterized in that the annular gap (15) existing 

between the bearing casing (2) and the shaft (3) is  
 

sealed, for instance, by means of a washer (13) embracing 
the shaft (3) and resting on the front side (10) of the 

bearing casing (2). 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 15,
 
characterized in that the outside of the injected plastic 

material (12) or metal is sloped towards the shaft end, 
particularly so in a conical manner. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 16,
 
characterized in that the plastic material (12) is a 

thermoplastic material, in particular a polyamide such as 
polyamide 6/12, or a duroplastic material, and in that the 

metal is a copper, lead and/or tin alloy. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 17,
 
characterized in that, in cured or permanently hardened 

condition, the plastic material (12) or metal, 
respectively, forms an axial bearing and a sealing for the 

shaft (3). 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 18,
 
characterized in that, in the area of the axial end (10) 

of the bearing casing (2), the outside of the bearing 
casing (2) is provided with recesses filled by the 

injection of the plastic material (12) or metal.  
 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 19,
 
characterized in that additional seals such as O-rings or 

the like are integrated in the plastic material (12) or 
in the metal. 
A wiper assembly as claimed in any one of claims 10 
through 20,
 
characterized in that the shaft (3) is a driven shaft of 

a wiper motor, the shaft of a wiper bearing or the like.
