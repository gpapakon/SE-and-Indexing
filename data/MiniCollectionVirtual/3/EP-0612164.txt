<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated wideband optical filter 
which is rapidly tunable to a large number of optical frequencies 

over a wide optical frequency range comprises two series 
connected optical filters of different resolutions formed in a 

semiconductive wafer. A control circuit applies electrical 
energy to predetermined controllably transmissive waveguides 

connecting components of the filters defined in the wafer. This 
tunes the overall filter to a desired one of a plurality of 

optical frequencies. Application of such electrical energy 
creates frequency selective pathways through the wafer able to 

pass one of up to hundreds of selected optical frequencies over 
the entire bandwidth of a semiconductive medium. This filter is 

economical to construct and is useful in high capacity, high 
speed optical communications networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More 
particularly, this invention relates to filters used in optical communications systems. The capacity and speed of communications systems may be increased by 
transmitting information in optical form over networks composed of optically 
transmissive nodes, fibers,  
 
waveguides, and the like. High capacity optical communications 
systems require that many optical signals be frequency division 
multiplexed in the components of an optical network. This 
requires that there be a way of conveniently detecting a single 
electromagnetic frequency and separating it from a plurality of 
multiplexed electromagnetic frequencies. An ideal device for 
detecting a single optical frequency and separating it from a 
plurality of multiplexed frequencies is a frequency selective 
optical filter. Until now, there has been no convenient approach 
to creating a suitable optical filter tunable to a large number 
of optical frequencies. The performance of prior filters has 
been limited in terms of tuning speed, frequency selectivity, or 
tuning range. All of these prior devices also have been 
expensive to implement. Our copending application (herein referred to as 
Glance 22) entitled Rapidly Tunable Integrated Optical 
Filter describes a rapidly tunable optical filter fabricated with 
wide gain bandwidth photonic integrated circuitry. The filter 
described in the application uses 1xN frequency routing devices 
such as the multiplexer/demultiplexer devices described in U.S. 
Patents 5,002,350 and 5,136,671. This filter is rapidly tunable 
to up to N discrete optical frequencies, where N is the number of 
branches of the frequency routers used in the filter. We have found that the number of discrete  
 
frequencies to which a filter using frequency routing devices may 
be dramatically increased by utilizing the periodic routing 
properties of the frequency routing devices like the ones 
described in the patents mentioned above. For example, the 
number of discrete frequencies to which such a filter may be 
tuned may be up to N². A filter in accordance with this 
invention thus will be able to detect optical frequencies ranging 
across the entire bandwidth of the semiconductor material used in 
photonic communications networks. A filter in accordance with 
this invention will also avoid the possibility of tuning to 
multiple indistinguishable frequencies separated by a free 
spectral region defined by the characteristics of the frequency 
routing devices used in
