<ABSTRACT>
A device for cassettes (3) for spring members (4) for a machine intended i.a. for cleaning of streets and roads, wherein the cassettes (3) are arranged in a bracket (2) around the periphery of a roller (1) and extending mainly in the longitudinal direction of the roller (1) and including spring members (4), such as radially projecting bristles, the ends of which are brought in contact with the ground at the rotation of the roller (1), wherein each cassette (3) includes a longish bar (9), which can be arranged in facing grooves (8) in brackets (2), extending along the roller (1), wherein each spring member is bended double around a locking means (10), extending in the longitudinal direction of the bar (9), and wherein the bar (9) shows a mainly U-shaped cross section with two facing sides (9.1) and a bottom between them. The facing sides (9.1) in the bar (9) are mutually connected by connecting means (11) extending across the cross section of the bar (9) at a distance from each other along the bar (9), wherein the bar (9) is divided into cells (9.4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device
for spring members for a machine intended i.a. for
cleaning of streets and roads, comprising cassettes
arranged in brackets around the periphery of a roller and extending
mainly in the longitudinal direction of the roller.
The cassettes include spring members, such as radially
projecting bristles, whoch ends are brought in contact
with the ground by rotation of the roller.A great number of solutions are known for the fastening
of cassettes for bristle bunches arranged around the
periphery of a bristle roller, which in its turn is rotatably
mounted on a sweeping machine or the similar.
US 4 302 863 describes a bristle roller
including elongated cassettes, in which bunches of bristles
are arranged in openings along the length of each
cassette. Each cassette is accomodated in a groove extending
along the length of the bristle roller and is constituted
by two facing U-shaped sheet profiles, which
provide facing openings in which bristle bunches are arranged
with radially projecting bristles. The bristle
bunches include spring members, which are bent double
at the bottom of each bunch around a locking wire, which
is arranged underneath the sheet profile located close to
the bristle roller and fixed by a loop-shaped projection
at the under side of the profile. The cassettes are given
a sufficiant rigidity in that the two sheet profiles
engage and constitute a closed cross section. A single
U-shaped profile open outwards would have a too low
rigidity to be practially used.Another embodiment of a bristle roller is known
from US 4 498 210. In this a cassette
is arranged in brackets, which in its turn are 
attached upon a longitudinally extended roller. The brackets
provide sliding grooves in which the cassettes are
brought. The spring members in each cassette are arranged
along the full extension of the cassette and are bent
double around a locking wire extending along the bottom
of the cassette. The spring members are kept in the cassette
because it is plastically as well as elastically
deformed after that the spring members are mounted in
a way that the locking wire is kept at the bottom of
the cassette and the spring members are jammed along the
extension of the cassette. A drawback with cassettes of
this design is that the locking wire is not fixed in an
exact position sideways or vertically along the extension
of the cassette. Cassettes according to this design
also are sensitive to water and dirt penetrating into
the inner of the cassettes as well as the brackets

bar (9) arranged in facing grooves (8) in the
brackets (2) extending along the roller, each spring

member being bent double around a locking means (10)
extending in the longitudinal direction of the bar (9),

the bar (9) having a mainly U-shaped cross section with
two facing long sides (9.1) and a bottom (9.2) between said sides,


characterized
 in that the two facing
long sides of the bar are mutually and firmly connected together

by connecting means (11) extending across the cross
section of the bar (9) spaced at a distance from each other along the bar (9),

wherein the long sides of the bar are kept together by
force and the bar is divided into cells by said connecting means, the connecting

means (11) being constituted by cross walls extending
mainly perpendicular to the long sides (9.1), the cross

walls comprising holes for receiving said locking means (10), said
locking means (10) comprising a locking wire (10) longitudinally

extending in the bar (9) through said holes. 
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the bar (9) is manufactured of
sheet metal and that the cross walls (11) are formed
