<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pivoting door (1) for a passageway through which people can pass, having a door leaf (8) which is arranged on a housing (2), is mounted such that it can pivot about a vertical axis (7), and which is driven via an electric motor (23) which can be activated with the aid of control means, provision being made for a braking device (17) which can likewise be activated by control means and is intended for arresting the door leaf (8) in the initial position and in the open position. The essence of the invention consists in the fact that the electric motor (23) is formed by a stepping motor, of which the rotor (24) is connected to the door leaf (8) in a rotationally locking manner and the stator (25) is arranged in a stationary manner.

A swing gate (1) for a gateway for persons, having a gate leaf (8) which is arranged on a 
housing, is pivotally mounted about a vertical axis (7) and is driven via an electric motor 

(23) controllable by control means, a brake device (17) likewise controllable by control 
means being provided to lock the gate leaf in the initial position and in the open position, 

characterised in that the electric motor (23) is formed by a stepping motor whose rotor 
(24) is connected to the gate leaf (8) in a rotationally-locked manner and whose stator 

(25) is fixed. 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the rotor (24) is connected 
to the gate leaf (8) via a bearing housing (22) connected in a rotationally-locked manner 

to both the rotor (24) and the gate leaf (8). 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the bearing housing (22) 
is connected in a rotationally-locked manner to the rotatable portion (19) of the brake 

device (17). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the stator 
(25) is fixedly arranged on a support device (20) extending upwards along the vertical 

axis (7). 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the support device (20) is 
in the form of a hollow shaft. 
A swing gate in accordance with either one of Claims 4 or 5, characterised in that the 
support device (20) passes through the stator (25). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 4 to 6, characterised in that the 
support device (20) is secured to a plate (16) arranged in the lower housing-column (3) of 

the housing (2).  
 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that stationary portion (18) of 
the brake device (17) is fixedly connected to the plate (16). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 4 to 8, characterised in that an upper 
housing-column (4) of the housing (2) is secured to the support device (20). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 9, characterised in that the U-shaped 
frame (9) of the gate leaf (8) is fixedly connected to the bearing housing (22) and 

to a bearing ring (31). 
A swing gate in accordance with Claim 10, characterised in that two O-rings (33) are 
arranged between the bearing ring (31) and the pivotal tube (14) of the gate leaf (8) and 

between the bearing housing (22) and the pivotal tube (14). 
A swing gate in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the rotor 
(24) is connected in a rotationally-locked manner to a drive shaft (36) driving the gate 

leaf (8) and arranged on the vertical shaft (7). 
A swing gate in accordance with either one of Claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the 
stator (25) is fixedly connected to the housing column (5).
