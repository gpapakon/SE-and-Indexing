<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cryo-ablation catheter, 
comprising a tube-like basic body with a proximal and a 

distal end wherein at the distal end a closed head made of a 
thermally conductive material has been arranged, a pressure 

line extending in the basic body from close to the proximal 
end to close to the head comprising a restriction at its 

distal end, and a discharge channel extending from the head 
to the proximal end. The pressure line is made of a 

synthetic material with a, compared to metal, low modulus of 
elasticity and a high thermal resistance coefficient. At the 

proximal end the pressure line is connected with a fluid 
source under pressure and with cooling means for the purpose 

of cooling the fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cryo-ablation
catheter as known from DE-A-2 332 513.The catheter known from this publication
comprises a tube-like basic body with a closed heat, made
of thermally conductive material, at the distal end. A
pressure line of pliable synthetic material has been
received in the basic body comprising a nozzle at its end
close to the head. A refrigerant having a low temperature
is sucked through the pressure line forming a thermal
insulation for the refrigerant. The head is cooled by the
contact with the refrigerant and also because of the
evaporation thereof. This cooling effect based on
evaporation is known as the Joule-Thompson effect. With
the head, thus cooled down, ablation procedures can be
carried out inside organs, for instance the stomach of a
patient.The invention has for its object to improve a
catheter of the type mentioned above, such that it can be
manufactured with a small diameter so that ablation
procedures can be carried out for instance inside the
heart of a patient. The catheter of the invention has to
be properly pliable and despite a small diameter an
appropriate, very low temperature of the head of the
catheter must be obtainable.This aim is achieved with the catheter as
characterized in claim 1. The fluid under pressure, which
can be a liquid as well as a gas, is pre-cooled to a low
value. Due to the pressure, sufficient fluid can be
supplied to the distal end of the catheter and a
substantial pressure drop can be obtained at the
restriction, so that at the tip of the catheter a very 
low temperature can be achieved due to the Joule-Thompson
effect already referred to. Even with small diameters of
the pressure line, having as a consequence a relatively
large surface area of the pressure line in relation to
the cross-sectional area thereof, only little heat
transfer will take place across the wall of the pressure
line, in view of the returning stream of expanded gas
flowing through the catheter. Inside the cooling means
the fluid is cooled to a temperature of for instance -
40Â°C.A suitable embodiment of this device is
characterized in claim 2. The discharged expanded
refrigerant can still have such a low temperature at the
proximal end of the discharge channel that it can be used
to pre-cool the refrigerant in the pressure line in a
suitable manner.Another suitable, preferred embodiment is
characterized in claim 3. Thus the fluid in the pressure
line can be cooled considerably and very simply, wherein
the cooling means need to take up only a relatively small
