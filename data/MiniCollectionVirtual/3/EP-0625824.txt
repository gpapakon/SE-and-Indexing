<ABSTRACT>
The control voltage 1 outputted by the control voltage 
generating circuit (1) is at a low level in a range where an 

external supply voltage Vcc is lower than the threshold 
value of the transistor (P1), but increases continuously in 

analog manner when the external supply voltage Vcc rises. 
After having matched the external supply voltage Vcc, the 

control voltage 1 increases in the same way as the 
external supply voltage Vcc. By use of the control voltage 

provided with the characteristics as described above for 
an output circuit, controlled is the gate of a transistor 

(P4) of a low-voltage operating output section (6) operative 
only at a voltage lower than a predetermined value. The 

transistor (P2) of a full-voltage operating output section 
(5) of the output circuit is always operative on the basis 

of the control signal H of the data output control circuit 
(3). When the external supply voltage is low below the 

predetermined value, the transistor (P4) is perfectly turned 
on, so that the conductance thereof increases. In the 

semiconductor integrated circuit device operative on the 
basis of a plurality of supply voltages, it is possible to 

prevent the operation margin from being reduced near the 
switching point of the gate voltages of the driving 

transistors and the data output transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
integrated circuit device, comprising:
a reference voltage generating circuit for generating
a reference voltage in response to being applied with a
supply voltage;a control voltage generating circuit for outputting a
control voltage changing substantially in analogue manner
according to the difference between the reference voltage
generated by said reference voltage generating circuit and
said supply voltage; anda data output control circuit for outputting a data
signal used for outputting data. Such a semiconductor
integrated circuit device is disclosed in US-4,906,866.
More specifically (though not exclusively) the invention
relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit device which
uses a plurality of supply voltages so as to correspond to
a microminiaturized structure.In the semiconductor integrated circuit device, the
elements thereof have now being microminiaturized rapidly
with an increase in need for higher integration rate.
Therefore, when an external supply voltage Vcc is applied
as it is to the integrated circuits formed on a semiconductor
substrate, there arise various problems in that a gate
oxide film of the elements is broken down, hot carriers are
produced, etc., so that the integrated circuits are
deteriorated in reliability and durability. To overcome
these problems, it has been required to provide an internal
supply voltage deboosting circuit for reducing an external
supply voltage within the semiconductor integrated circuit
device itself. For instance, an external supply voltage
of 5 V is deboosted down to about 3 V through the internal
supply voltage deboosting circuit. When this deboosted
supply voltage is used, it is also possible to reduce the
power consumption of the semiconductor device.For the reason as described above, although the
internal supply voltage deboosting circuit has been adopted
for the semiconductor device, so far it has been difficult
to secure a margin in both the low voltage operation and
the high voltage operation in the same integrated circuits.
Therefore, when the supply voltage is low, since the
transistor driving capability decreases, the conductances
of the data outputting transistor and the internal voltage 
supply driving transistor have been both increased to
supplement the decrease in the transistor driving capability
and further to compensate for a delay in data output and
a drop in the internally deboosted supply voltage. In
contrast with this, when the supply voltage is high, since
the transistor
