<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a process for 
producing a patented steel wire having a 

microstructure which is essentially pearlite with a 
very fine lamellar spacing between carbide and ferrite 

platelets which has good ductility and which can be 
drawn to develop high tensile strength, said process 

comprising the steps of: 

(1) heating a steel wire to a temperature which 
is within the range of approximately 850°C to about 

1050°C for a period of at least about 2 seconds; 
wherein said steel wire is comprised of a microalloyed 

high carbon steel which consists essentially of about 
97.03 to about 98.925 weight percent iron, from about 

0.72 to about 0.92 weight percent carbon, from about 
0.3 to about 0.8 weight percent manganese, from about 

0.05 to about 0.4 weight percent silicon, and from 
about 0.005 to about 0.85 weight percent of at least 

one member selected from the group consisting of 
chromium, vanadium, nickel, and boron, with the 

proviso that the total amount of silicon, manganese, 
chromium, vanadium, nickel, and boron in the 

microalloyed high carbon steel is within the range of 
about 0.7 to 0.9 weight percent; 
(2) continuously cooling the steel wire at a 
cooling rate of less than 100°C per second until a 

transformation from austenite to pearlite begins; 
(3) allowing the transformation from austenite 
to pearlite to proceed with an increase in the wire 

temperature resulting from recalescence; and 
(4) cooling the patented steel wire to ambient 
temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is frequently desirable to reinforce rubber 
articles, for example, tires, conveyor belts, power 
transmission belts, timing belts, hoses, and the like 
products, by incorporating therein steel reinforcing 
elements. Pneumatic vehicle tires are often 
reinforced with cords prepared from brass coated steel 
filaments. Such tire cords are frequently composed of 
high carbon steel or high carbon steel coated with a 
thin layer of brass. Such a tire cord can be a 
monofilament, but normally is prepared from several 
filaments which are stranded or bunched together. In 
some instances, depending upon the type of tire being 
reinforced, the strands of filaments are further 
cabled to form the tire cord. It is important for the steel alloy utilized in 
filaments for reinforcing elements to exhibit high 
strength and ductility as well as high fatigue 
resistance. Unfortunately, many alloys which possess 
this demanding combination of requisite properties 
cannot be processed in a practical commercial 
operation. The alloys which have proved to be 
commercially important have typically required a 
patenting procedure wherein they are subjected to an 
isothermal transformation from austenite to pearlite. 
United States Patent 5,167,727 describes such a 
process wherein steel filaments are manufactured 
utilizing a patenting step wherein the transformation 
from austenite to pearlite is carried out under 
isothermal conditions at a temperature which is within 
the range of about 540°C to about 620°C. Such 
isothermal transformations are normally carried out in 
a fluidized bed or in a molten lead medium to maintain 
a constant temperature for the duration of the  
 
transformation. However, the utilization of such an 
isothermal transformation step requires special 
equipment and adds to the cost of the patenting 
procedure. A fine lamellar spacing between carbide and 
ferrite platelets in the patented steel wire is 
required to develop high tensile strengths while 
maintaining the good ductility required for drawing 
the wire. To achieve this goal, small quantities of 
various alloying metals are sometimes added to the 
steel in order to improve the mechanical properties 
which can be attained by using isothermal patenting 
techniques. An alternative to isothermal patenting is 
continuous cooling or "air" patenting. In this 
process, high carbon steel wire is allowed to cool in 
air or other gas, such as cracked ammonia, which can 
be either still or forced in order to control the rate 
of cooling. This
