<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel indane 
and indene derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions 
containing these compounds and their use for the 
manufacture of a medicament for antagonizing endothelin 
receptors. Endothelin (ET) is a highly potent 
vasoconstrictor peptide synthesized and released by the 
vascular endothelium. Endothelin exists as three 
isoforms, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3. Of these, only ET-1 and 
ET-3 have been found to be expressed in mammalian 
systems. [Unless otherwise stated "endothelin" shall 
mean any or all of the isoforms of endothelin]. 
Endothelin has profound effects on the cardiovascular 
system, and in particular, the coronary, renal and 
cerebral circulation. Elevated or abnormal release of 
endothelin is associated with smooth muscle contraction 
which is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular, respiratory and renal pathophysiology. 
Elevated levels of endothelin have been reported in 
plasma from patients with essential hypertension, acute 
myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
atherosclerosis, and patients with uraemia undergoing 
dialysis. Invivo, endothelin has pronounced effects on 
blood pressure and cardiac output. An intravenous bolus 
injection of ET (0.1 to 3 nmol/kg) in rats causes a 
transient, dose-related depressor response (lasting 0.5 
to 2 minutes) followed by a sustained, dose-dependent 
rise in arterial blood pressure which can remain 
elevated for 2 to 3 hours following dosing. Doses above 
3 nmol/kg in a rat often prove fatal.  Endothelin appears to produce a preferential 
effect in the renal vascular bed. It produces a marked, 
long-lasting decrease in renal blood flow, accompanied 
by a significant decrease in GFR, urine volume, urinary 
sodium and potassium excretion. Endothelin produces a 
sustained antinatriuretic effect, despite significant 
elevations in atrial natriuretic peptide. Endothelin 
also stimulates plasma renin activity. These findings 
suggest that ET is involved in the regulation of renal 
function and is involved in a variety of renal disorders 
including acute renal failure, cyclosporine 
nephrotoxicity and chronic renal failure. Studies have shown that invivo, the cerebral 
vasculature is highly sensitive to both the vasodilator 
and vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin. Therefore, 
ET may be an important mediator of cerebral vasospasm, a 
frequent and often fatal consequence of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. ET also exhibits direct central nervous system 
effects such as severe apnea and
