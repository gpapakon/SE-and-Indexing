<ABSTRACT>
PLL circuits which have both the merits of the 
analog phase control, in which the good C/N ratio can be 

realized, and the merits of the digital phase control, 
in which the broad-band lock can be performed, and 

multi-channel FM receiving method and apparatus which 
are able to utilize the PLL circuit to reduce the 

influence of the leakage occurring among input signals 
and suppress the image disturbance. One of the PLL 

circuits includes: a VCO (43); a pre-scaler (44) for 
dividing a feedback signal obtained from the VCO (43); a 

first distributor (45) for distributing the feedback 
signal to send first and second digital feedback signals 

(D1, D2); a second distributor (42) for distributing a 
reference signal to send a digital reference signal (D) 

and an analog reference signal (A); a digital phase 
comparator (46) for comparing the digital reference 

signal (D) and the first digital feedback signal (D1) 
with each other to send a digital phase error signal; a 

charge pump (47); a mixer (48) for adding the digital 
phase error signal to an analog phase error signal, 

which is obtained by comparing the analog reference 
signal (A) with the second digital feedback signal (D2) 

to send a composite phase error signal; and a low-pass 
filter (49) for eliminating high frequency components 

from the composite phase error signal to input the 
resultant signal to the VCO (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
a PLL (phase-locked loop) circuit which is used to
improve the C/N ratio of a broad-band voltage controlled
oscillator (hereinafter, referred to as "a VCO" for
short, when applicable) which has the high sensitivity,
and more particularly to a PLL circuit which is utilized
in a synthesizer for which the excellent spectrum is
required, and multi-channel FM receiving method and
apparatus which are capable of utilizing this PLL
circuit and which are utilized as either a front-end
device of a BS or CS tuner, or a receiving side front-end
device used in the CATV service and the like in a
local area.Heretofore, in such a PLL circuit, for
example, a digital phase comparator has been used and
its phase detecting voltage is subjected to the
amplification and filtering through a charge pump
circuit to be used as a control voltage for a VCO. Fig.
1 is a functional block diagram showing a configuration
of a conventional digital PLL circuit. In Fig. 1, the
reference numeral 1 designates a digital phase 
comparator which operates to compare two digital signals
input thereto with each other to output a signal
representing a phase difference therebetween, and the
reference numeral 2 designates a charge pump which
operates to smooth the phase difference signal through
an active type low-pass filter, thereby subjecting the
pulse waveform to the amplification and smoothing. The
reference numeral 3 designates a VCO which receives a
control voltage as a DC voltage to vary a frequency of
an output oscillation signal. The output signal of the
charge pump 2 is supplied as the control voltage to the
VCO 3. The reference numeral 4 designates a pre-scaler
which frequency-divides the output oscillation signal of
the VCO 3 to obtain a feedback signal having a suitable
frequency, and the reference numeral 5 designates a
reference signal generator which generates a reference
signal.In the configuration shown in Fig. 1, the
digital PLL circuit is designed in such a way that the
phase error occurring between the reference signal and
the feedback signal is detected by the digital phase
comparator 1, and the DC control voltage corresponding
to that phase error is input to the VCO 3 through the
charge pump 2, thereby obtaining the output signal
having a predetermined frequency.On the other hand, Fig. 2 is a functional
block diagram showing a configuration of a conventional
analog PLL circuit. In Fig. 2, the reference numeral 11 
designates a multiplier (a mixer) which multiplies two
analog
