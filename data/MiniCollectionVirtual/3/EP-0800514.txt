<ABSTRACT>
Novel imides are inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor  alpha  and can be used to combat cachexia, endotoxic shock, and retrovirus replication. A typical embodiment is 2-Phthalimido-3-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)propane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a method of reducing levels of TNFα in a mammal and to compounds and compositions useful therein.TNFα, or tumor necrosis factor α, is a cytokine which is released primarily by mononuclear phagocytes in response to various immunostimulators. When administered to animals or humans it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular effects, hemorrhage, coagulation and acute phase responses similar to those seen during acute infections and shock states.Excessive or unregulated TNFα production has been implicated in a number of disease conditions. These include endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome {Tracey et al., Nature330, 662-664 (1987) and Hinshaw et al., Circ. Shock30, 279-292 (1990)}; cachexia {Dezube et al., Lancet,335(8690), 662 (1990)}; and Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome where TNFα concentration in excess of 12,000 pg/milliliters have been detected in pulmonary aspirates from ARDS patients {Millar et al., Lancet2(8665), 712-714 (1989)}. Systemic infusion of recombinant TNFα also resulted in changes typically seen in ARDS {Ferrai-Baliviera et al., Arch. Surg.124(12), 1400-1405 (1989)}.TNFα appears to be involved in bone resorption diseases, including arthritis where it has been determined that when activated, leukocytes will produce a bone-resorbing activity, and data suggest that TNFα contributes to this activity. {Bertolini et al., Nature319, 516-518 (1986) and Johnson et al., Endocrinology124(3), 1424-1427 (1989).} It has been determined that TNFα stimulates bone resorption and inhibits bone formation in vitro and in vivo through stimulation of osteoclast formation and activation combined with inhibition of osteoblast function. Although TNFα may be involved in many bone resorption diseases, including arthritis, the most compelling link with disease is the association between production of TNFα by tumor or host tissues and malignancy associated hypercalcemia {Calci. Tissue Int. (US)46(Suppl.), S3-10 (1990)}. In Graft versus Host Reaction, increased serum TNFα levels have been associated with major complication following acute allogenic bone marrow transplants {Holler et al., Blood,75(4), 1011-1016 (1990)}.Cerebral malaria is a lethal hyperacute neurological syndrome associated with high blood levels of TNFα and the most severe complication occurring in malaria patients. Levels of serum TNFα correlated directly with the severity of disease and the prognosis in patients with acute malaria attacks {Grau et al., N.Engl. J. Med. 320(24), 1586-1591 (1989)}.TNFα also plays
