<ABSTRACT>
A flexible film (11) and flexible food storage bag (10) for packaging produce such as vegetables and fruits wherein the film or bag has plurality of microholes (12) specifically designed to allow the produce to breathe in a controlled rate such that localized condensation and weight loss is minimized, which in turn reduces microbial (bacteria and mold) growth and reduces produce mushiness (softness) respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to food packaging film and food storage bags made from 
said film for storing, for example, produce such as vegetables and fruits. More particularly, this 
invention relates to flexible produce storage bags having a pattern of microholes specifically 
designed to allow produce contained in the bag to breathe in a controlled rate, such that 
localized condensation is reduced, which in turn, reduces microbial (bacteria and mold) growth 
and produce mushiness (softness). The perforated bags of the present invention also control 
the weight loss of the stored produce, thus minimizing the shriveling and wilting of 
unpackaged products. Because fresh fruits and vegetables give off gases and retain moisture when 
stored in bags, it has long been a challenge for the packaging industry to provide a container or 
bag for storing produce that will help maintain the quality or shelf life of the produce while 
stored. There are several well-known techniques available for packaging of produce to 
maintain their quality or extend their shelf life, including, for example, the use of controlled 
modified atmosphere packaging, shrink wraps, functional or active packaging and 
impermeable plastic storage bags. However, such known procedures do not adequately 
control or maintain the quality of produce. There is still a need in the industry for a packaging 
material such as a storage bag that will minimize local condensation and produce weight loss. In an attempt to address the condensation problem of stored produce, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,735,308 discloses an internally lined food storage bag useful in the storage of moisture-retentive 
foods, such as fruit and vegetables. The storage bag comprises a hand-closed water-impermeable 
outer bag containing an absorbent inner bag. The construction of the bag 
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,735,308 is complicated and does not involve the use of 
microperforations to control the perspiration of produce. It is also known to provide a ventilated plastic bag, for example, a bag containing 
slits as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,399,822 or bags with microperforations as described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,886,372, for storing vegetables. U.S. 3,399,822, for example, provides slits in a 
plastic bag to prevent contamination of vegetables stored in the bag, but does not address the 
moisture or weight loss problem of stored vegetables. U.S. Patent No. 4,886,372, for example, discloses controlling the ripening of 
produce and fruits by using a container or bag having a

A flexible food storage bag (10) comprising a thermoplastic flexible bag 
(10) closable at the top thereof, having a plurality of microholes (12) and the thickness of the 

bag wall (11) being less than 5 mils (0.127 mm) characterized in that 
said bag (10) is adapted for storing low, medium or high respirating produce, said microholes 

(12) having a diameter of from about 250 microns to about 950 microns, said microholes (12) 
uniformly distributed in the bag (10) to provide a percent void area in the bag (10) of from 

about 0.05 percent to about 2.75 percent such that localized condensation into bag (10) is 
such that the Padres number of the bag (10) is less than 1.74 and the weight loss of the produce 

is less than about 8 percent.  
 
The bag of Claim 1 wherein the hole density is from 3 holes/in
2
 (3 holes/6.45 
cm
2
) to 8 holes/in
2
 (8 holes/6.45 cm
2
). 
The bag of Claim 1 wherein the bag is used for containing produce at less 
than about 15Â°C. 
The bag of Claim 1 wherein the distance between any two adjacent 
microholes is from the diameter size of a microhole up to 2 inches (50.8 mm). 
The bag of Claim 1 wherein the bag contains a zipper type closure. 
The bag of Claim 1 wherein the bag contains a pleat at the bottom of the 
bag. 
The bag of Claim 1 having a printed surface thereon. 
The bag of Claim 1 having a tint material therein. 
The bag of Claim 1 having a textured surface. 
The bag of Claim 1 having an embossed surface thereon.  
 
A process for making a flexible food storage bag (10) the thickness of the 
bag wall (11) being less than 5 mils (0.127 mm), comprising 

incorporating a plurality of microholes (12) in a bag closable at the top thereof characterized 
in that the bag (10) is adapted for 

storing low, medium or high respirating produce, said bag being made from a thermoplastic 
material, said microholes of said bag having a diameter of from about 250 microns to about 

950 microns, said microholes uniformly distributed in the bag to provide a percent void area in 
the bag of from about 0.05 percent to about 2.75 percent such that the localized condensation 

in the bag is such that the Padres number of the bag is less than 1.74 to substantially prevent 
microbial growth and the weight loss of the produce is kept at less than about 8 percent to 

substantially prevent shriveling and wilting.  
 
A process for increasing the quality of produce comprising storing the 
produce in a flexible zippered storage bag (10) closable at the top thereof with specially 

designed pattern of microholes (12), the thickness of the bag wall (11) being less than 5 mils 
(0.127 mm) characterized in that the bag is adapted for storing low, medium or high respirating 

produce, said bag being made from a thermoplastic material, said microholes of said bag 
having a diameter of from about 250 microns to about 950 microns, said microholes uniformly 

distributed in the bag to provide a percent void area in the bag of from about 0.05 percent to 
about 2.75 percent such that localized condensation in the bag is such that the Padres number

the food products is such that the Padres number is less than 1.74 and the weight loss of the 
food product is kept at less than about 8 percent whereby microbial growth, shriveling and 

wilting is substantially prevented.
