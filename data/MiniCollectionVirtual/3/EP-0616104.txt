<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a section 
member assembly, particularly designed for making 

book and sliding main doors, which comprises upright 
section members (1,2) and cross section members (3,4) for making 

fixed frames and wing frames. 
The main feature of the invention is that 
the section member assembly further comprises hinge 

elements (16), including a block member (10) which can be engaged 

in a seat of the upright (1,2) and can be locked in 
its engaged position, by means of a threaded dowel (12) 

engaging in a threaded hole (11) of the block member (10) and 
bottoming on the bottom portion of the seat. 
The block members comprise a pair of threaded 
seats (20), for engaging therein bolts (18), passing through 

the legs (15) of the hinge elements (16), extending from the 
cylindric body (17) housing the pivot pin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a section
member assembly, particularly designed for making
book and sliding main doors.As is known, great difficulties are encountered
in making industrial closures starting from aluminium
section members, mainly due to a lackness
of a specific design of the section members for the
specific type of use.Moreover, prior art solutions do not provide
the possibility of making main doors having
large spans and heights, since they would not have
a proper mechanical strength.Another drawback is that prior section member
assemblies for the above mentioned use are affected
by great assembling problems, and, for the
mounting procedure,there is required a lot of
labour.The document DE-A-3 525 717 discloses a section member assembly
substantially according to the preamble of the main claim.Accordingly, the main object of the present
invention is to overcome the above mentioned problems,
by providing a section member assembly, specifically
designed for making book and sliding main
doors, which assembly comprises section members 
specifically designed for allowing a quick and easy
assembly, so as to also provide main doors with
great spans and heights.Within the scope of the above mentioned
aim, a main object of the present invention is to
provide such a section member assembly the section
members of which allow to easily and quickly make
industrial closures which can be specifically constructed
both in a manually operated embodiment
and in a motor operated embodiment and which further
allow a lot of fittings to be applied thereto.Another object of the present invention is
to provide such a section member assembly the section
members of which are provided with a very good
mechanical and athmospheric corrosion strength thereby
providing a main frame which is very reliable
in operation.According to one aspect of the present invention,
the above mentioned aim and objects, as
well as yet other objects, which will become more
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a section
member assembly, specifically designed for making
book and sliding main doors, according to the main claim. Further characteristics and advantages of
the invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed disclosure of a preferred, though
not exclusive, embodiment of a section member assembly
particularly designed for making books and
sliding main doors, which is illustrated, by way
of an indicative, but not limitative, example, in
the accompanying drawings, where:

<CLAIMS>
A section member assembly, specifically
designed for making book and sliding main doors,

comprising upright section members (1, 2) and cross-section
members (3, 4), for making fixed frames and wing

frames, said section member assembly further
comprising hinge elements (16) including each a separated

block member (10), which can be locked into a
respective seat of a said upright section member (1, 2)

by screws (18) and a threaded dowel (12), passing
through respective holes (19) of a said hinge

element and engageable in respective threaded holes of said
block member (10), said threaded dowel (12) having a

point (13) adapted to be abutted against the bottom
of said seat of said upright section member,

characterized in that said hinge element comprises an
uninterrupted side perforated leg (15) integral with

and extending along one side of a substantially
continuous cylindric body (17) of said hinge element,

said cylindric body housing therein a pivot pin of
said hinge element, said side leg (15) including at

least a top and a bottom pluralities of holes (19)
registering with respective said threaded holes (20,

11) of said block member, that each said top and
bottom plurality of holes includes three holes (19) 

arranged respectively at the top and at the bottom of
said perforated leg (15) for respectively registering

with the holes (20, 11) of a respective top and
bottom block member each embedded in a said

respective seat of said upright section member and
that said cylindric body (17) is provided with a

cylindric hollow in which an anti-turning bush
element (21) can be engaged, said anti-turning bush

element being provided with a single integral flange
(22) adapted to be engaged at the end portion of the

cylindric body, from said flange (22) a cylindric
mantle (23) extending which is provided with spoke

element (24) engageable in corresponding slots (25)
formed in the hollow of the cylindric body.
A section member assembly according to
Claim 1, characterized in that angular connection

blocks (30) are moreover provided, said connection
angular blocks (30) comprising extruded lengths,

including mutually perpendicular arms (30a, 30b)
which can be engaged in corresponding seats of a

related upright or cross-member (2, 3), said arms
(30a, 30b) being provided, through increased

thickness regions thereof, with threaded holes (32)
therein are engaged screws for connecting said

upright and cross-members (2, 3). 
A section member assembly, according to
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said section

member assembly further comprises means for abutting
and connecting intermediate cross-members (4), said means

comprising self-threading screws (35) which can be
engaged in holes of said cross-member and threaded in

engaging seats (36) provided longitudinally of a
cross-member body.

one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in

that said section member assembly further comprises,
on said wing frames, a plurality of locking

vertically extending rods (51) which are slidably
housed with respect to the upright and being engaged

in seats respectively formed on the ground and on a
top fixed frame cross member (52).
A section member assembly, according to
one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in

that said section member assembly further comprises, 
on an abutment edge portion of said book main door, a

bottom guide roller (55) engaging in a bottom rail and a truck (56) which is
