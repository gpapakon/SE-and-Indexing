<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cephem 
compounds which are useful as intermediates for the 
production of cephem antibiotics, and a process for 
producing the same, as well as their use for the 
preparation of cephem antibiotics or precursors thereof. For the preparation of cephem antibiotics 
containing (E)-propenyl group at the 3-position thereof, 
there is known a process described in, e.g., Japanese 
Patent KOKOKU No. 3-57106 (corresponding to U.S. Patent 
No. 4,751,295) which comprises reacting a (Z)-3-[3-chloro-1-propenyl]cephem 
compound obtained by Wittig 
reaction with sodium iodide to isomerize the (Z)-3-[3-chloro-1-propenyl]cephem 
compound and simultaneously 
cause halogen exchange to give the 3-[(E)-3-iodo-1-propenyl]cephem 
compound as the intermediate and then 
reacting the 3-[(E)-3-iodo-1-propenyl]cephem compound 
with a tertiary amine to give the ammonio-compound. 
However, the process encounters problems for industrial 
production that the intermediate 3-[(E)-3-iodo-1-propenyl]cephem 
compound is not sufficiently stable and 
the yield of the intermediate is not satisfactorily 
high. As a matter of course, the yield of the ammonio-cephem 
derivatives obtained via the intermediate is not 
always satisfactory.  In order to establish a process producing 
cephem antibiotics or their precursors which can be 
replaced for the disadvantageous prior art process using 
3-[(E)-3-iodo-1-propenyl]cephem compounds as the 
intermediate, the present inventors have made extensive 
investigations. As a result, novel intermediates have 
been found. Therefore, an object of the present invention 
is to provide cephem compounds which are useful as 
intermediates for the production of cephem antibiotics. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for producing such 3-[(E)-1-propenyl]cephem 
compounds advantageously. A further object of the present invention is 
to provide ammonio-cephem derivatives by using specific 
cephem compounds. The present invention provides a 3-[(E)-1-propenyl]cephem 
compound shown by the following formula 
(Ia): 
wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, a protective group for 
an amino group, or a group shown by formula (II):  wherein R³ is a protective group for an amino group, R⁴ 
is a protective group for a hydroxyl group and W is 
-CH= or -N=; R²² represents a protective group for a 
carboxyl group; and X¹ represents hydrogen or chlorine, 
provided that R¹ is hydrogen when X¹ is hydrogen and 
that R²² is not diphenylmethyl when X¹ is hydrogen. The present
