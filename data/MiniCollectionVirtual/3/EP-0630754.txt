<ABSTRACT>
In the discharge recovery device for use in an ink 
jet recording apparatus utilizing plural different 

inks, there are provided caps (51) for covering the 
recording heads (9), in a number corresponding to the 

number of inks, but suction pumps (53) are provided in a 
fewer number and made selectively connectable to the 

caps (51), in order to simplify the recovery device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording apparatus equipped with a recovery mechanism
for maintaining and recovering satisfactory ink
discharge state.The ink jet recording apparatus achieves printing
on paper by discharging liquid ink from a head. As
shown in Fig. 18, a carriage 101, supporting a printing
head 105 and an ink tank or an ink supply tube, moves
in a print-scanning direction to effect printing on the
paper.The conventional ink jet recording apparatus is
usually equipped with a cap for tightly covering the
nozzle-bearing face of the printing head when the
printing operation is not effected, in order to prevent
drying of the printing head and leakage of printing ink
from the head. Also an ink-sucking pump is usually
provided in communication with the cap, for recovering
from printing defect resulting from the nozzle clogging
with dusts or from air entrusion into the nozzle.Recently there is becoming popular the apparatus
utilizing plural printing heads and inks of plural
colors for enabling color printing. There are at least 
required three colors of cyan, magenta and yellow for
full color printing, and the main trend is in the
printers utilizing inks of four colors, including black
in addition to the above-mentioned three colors. As a
result there are provided plural caps for respective
printing heads, and the color printer is equipped with
four caps.Fig. 18 is a schematic view of an ink jet
recording apparatus, wherein provided are a carriage
101; a main body 102 including a paper transporting
unit; a recovery mechanism 103 for the recovery
operation for the printing head; and printing heads
105. The carriage 101 is rendered movable along a
guide shaft 111, and is driven by a carriage motor 115
through a belt 114. When the main body receives
printing data, the carriage 101 effects scanning motion
along the guide shaft 111, in order to effect printing
on a sheet of paper, to be transported by an
unrepresented paper transporting unit. In the vicinity
of the carriage there is provided an encoder film 113
for detecting the absolute position of the carriage,
and an encoder mounted on the carriage detects the
absolute position of the carriage. The home position
of the carriage is thus determined.Fig. 19 is a perspective view of an example of the
conventional recovery mechanism, wherein shown are a
cap 131; a cap holder 132 supporting the cap; a pump 
135; and a lever 136 for activating the pump. Fig. 20
is a cross-sectional view seen in a direction indicated
by arrows A' in Fig. 19,
