<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a useful process for
preparing β-lactam antibiotics, and specifically to a process for
preparing carbapenam derivatives, which are useful intermediates for
the preparation of β-lactam antibiotics, as well as intermediates
which are useful for the process. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a process for preparation of β-lactam antibiotics
which comprises cyclization of useful azetidinone
derivatives, as well as such azetidinone derivatives.Currently, β-lactam antibiotics are clinically used in the
treatment of infections. The β-lactam antibiotics may be classified,
and include antibiotics having carbapenam or the carbapenem nucleus,
which belong to newer types of antibiotics.A process for preparation of carbapenam or carbapenem
antibiotics may involve a process which comprises making
derivatives having the carbapenam nucleus from azetidinone
derivatives. Such a process is described in EP 0037080 A1, and is as
shown below: 
This process involves cyclization which comprises heating the diazo
compound at 50-100 °C, and preferably heating in the presence of a
catalyst, CuSO4, Pd(OAc)2, or Rh2(OAc)4. To date, the process has
been utilized industrially in large scale.However, the above process is disadvantageous in that the
azide reagent and the diazo compound used in the process are
explosive when they are heated. In other words, it is very
dangerous to treat a large amount of the diazo compound.
Accordingly, the above process is not desirable as an industrial process
for preparation of carbapenem antibiotics.The applicants have experimented and found a safe and
convenient process for the preparation of carbapenem antibiotics, which
does not comprise using the above azide reagent and diazo
compound.The present invention relates to a process for preparing a
β-lactam compound of the formula (I):
in which R1 is hydrogen; straight or branched C1 -
C6 alkyl which is optionally substituted by halogen or
hydroxy which may be substituted by a hydroxy-protecting
group selected from C1 - C4 alkoxycarbonyl;
halogenated (C1 - C3 alkoxy) carbonyl; benzyloxycarbonyl
of which the benzene ring may have a
substituent or substituents selected from
o-nitro, p-nitro and P-methoxy;tri-(C1 - C4)alkylsilyl;
C1 - C4 alkoxymethyl; C1 - C4 alkoxy (C1 - C4)
alkoxymethyl; C1 - C4 alkylthiomethyl; or
tetrahydropyranyl, or amino which is optionally
substituted by an amino protecting group selected from
C1 - C8 alkyl; C7 - C20 aralkyl; C6 - C12 arylthio; C1 - C8
alkylidene; C7 - C14
