<ABSTRACT>
A hose connector for a vacuum cleaner (10) having a lid (14) includes 
a hose inlet having opening extending through a skirt (24) of the 

lid, surfaces disposed on one of the hose inlet and the 
connection end (50) defining slot portions extending in a particular 

direction and flange portions disposed on opposite sides 
of the other of the hose inlet and the connection end. Each 

slot portion has a width sufficient to receive a flange 
portion. The vacuum cleaner is assembled by sliding the connection 

end into the opening along the particular direction before the 
lid is assembled on the skirt such that the flange portions 

are received in the slot portions. The lid is thereafter 
placed on the tank (12) such that a tank receiving portion of the 

connection end receives a portion of the tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to vacuum
apparatus, and more particularly to a connector for securing
a hose to a vacuum cleaner,
such as it is, for example, known from US-A-5 086 537 or US-A-3
246 359.Vacuum cleaning devices of the tank type, particularly
those of the wet/dry variety, generally include a tank,
a lid assembly removably disposed on the tank and a hose
secured to the lid assembly. Conventionally, the hose is
secured to the assembly by means of an interference or
friction fit of the hose with walls defining a hose inlet.
The tank is typically mounted on casters or wheels to facilitate
movement thereof.Often, during use of the above-described vacuum
cleaning device, an operator pulls on the hose as cleaning is
undertaken. This pulling can cause the hose to unseat from
the hose inlet, thereby resulting in the need for the operator
to temporarily interrupt the cleaning process to reseat the
hose. In some cases, this interruption can become more
frequent with use owing to the presence of dust and debris
between the hose and the walls defining the hose inlet or
simply due to wear. It is the object of the present invention, to provide
a vacuum
cleaner with a hose connector establishing a positive and secure connection
between the hose and a hose inlet.
This objective is achieved by a vacuum cleaner having the
features of claim 1. The hose connector of the present invention provides
a positive and secure attachment of a hose to a hose inlet,
thereby minimizing the need to periodically stop and reattach
the hose to the hose inlet during use.Fig. 1 comprises a perspective view of a wet/dry
vacuum incorporating the hose connector of the present
invention;Fig. 2 comprises a front elevational view of the
wet/dry vacuum of Fig. 1 with the hose shown in section;Fig. 3 comprises a plan view of the wet/dry vacuum
of Fig. 1;Fig. 4 comprises a front elevational view of the
wet/dry vacuum of Fig. 1 in a disassembled state;Fig. 5 comprises an enlarged fragmentary view of a
portion of the lid assembly of Fig. 4 showing the hose inlet
in greater detail;Fig. 6 comprises a partial sectional view taken
generally along the line 6-6 of Fig. 3;Fig. 7 comprises a side elevational view of the
connection end of the hose of Fig. 1;Fig. 8 comprises a further side elevational view of
the connection end of Fig. 7;Fig. 9 comprises a plan view of the connection end
of Fig. 7; and Fig. 10 comprises a front elevational view of the
connection end of Fig. 7.Referring now to Figs. 1-3, a tank-type wet/dry
vacuum 10

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum cleaner (10) with a hose connector, wherein
the vacuum cleaner (10) includes a lid (22) having a skirt (24)

detachably received on a tank (12), a hose (16) having a
connection end (50)

to be connected to the lid (22), the lid (22) having, a hose
inlet (34) with an opening (35) which

extends downwardly so as to form a gap (44) in the skirt (24),

   one of the hose inlet (34) or the
connection end (50) defining slots (62); and

   flanges (36) disposed on the hose inlet (34) or the connection
end

(50) respectively
wherein each slot (62) has a width sufficient to receive one of the

flanges (36), the connection end (50) further including a tank
receiving portion (78, 80) so as to provide connection to the tank (12);

   wherein the vacuum cleaner (10) is assembled by sliding the connection
end (50) into the hose inlet opening (35)

such that the flanges (36) are
received in the slots (62) and wherein the lid (22) is thereafter

placed on the tank (12) such that the tank receiving portion (78, 80)
receives a portion of the tank (12).
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the flanges (36)
are disposed on the hose inlet (34) and the slots (62) are

disposed on the connection end (50).
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the flanges (36)
are disposed on opposite sides of the hose inlet (34) and the

slots (62) are disposed on opposite sides of the connection end. 
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the tank receiving
portion comprises spaced first and second additional flange

portions (78, 80) disposed on opposite sides of an upper wall
portion (74) of the tank (12) when the lid is assembled thereto.
The vacuum cleaner of claim 4, wherein the skirt (24) has
a skirt lower edge (72) and wherein the first additional flange

portion (80) is disposed outside of the tank and includes a
flange lower edge coincident with the skirt lower edge when the

lid is disposed on the tank.
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the skirt (24) has
a skirt lower edge (72) and wherein the opening (35) extends

through the skirt lower edge (72).
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the connection end
(50) has a longitudinal axis (73) which extends substantially

perpendicular to the particular direction when the hose (16) is
assembled to the lid. 
The vacuum cleaner of claim 1, wherein the opening (35) is
offset from a centerline (37) of the lid.
