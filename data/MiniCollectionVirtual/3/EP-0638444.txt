<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wheel for railway rolling stock such as a motive power unit or a wagon comprising a hub (5) and, at a predetermined distance from its axis, having a running surface, the flanks of which directly produce bearing surfaces for brake linings, this wheel being CHARACTERISED in that it exhibits, between the hub (5) and the bearing surfaces (4) for the brake linings, an intermediate region (10), the thickness of which is substantially reduced relative to the thickness of the wheel measured between the braking surfaces (4) borne by the flanks of the peripheral part (11), this intermediate region producing a wheel disc (12) for joining the said peripheral part (11) and the hub (5) of the wheel together.

A one-piece wheel for railway stock, comprising a hub (5) and bearing ― at a 
predetermined distance from its axis (6) ― a running surface (7) whose flanks (8, 9) 

directly define bearing surfaces (4) for brake linings (3),
 
which wheel has means for reducing temperature propagation at the time of braking, 

this wheel being characterised in that: 

between the hub (5) and the bearing surfaces (4) for the brake linings, it has an 
intermediate zone (10) which is substantially less thick than the wheel measured between 

the braking surfaces (4) borne by the flanks of the peripheral part (11), this intermediate 
zone defining a linking wheel-body (12) between the said peripheral part (11) and the 

hub (5) of the wheel and, 
the intermediate wheel-body (12) decreases in thickness from the hub (5) to its junction 
with the peripheral part (11) bearing the bearing surfaces (4) for the brake linings (3) and 

is joined to this peripheral part (11) by joining means (14) limiting the stress 
concentrations. 
A wheel in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the height (H) of this body 
(12) is sufficiently great in relation to the diameter of the wheel to form a thermal barrier 

between the peripheral part (11) and the hub (5). 
A wheel in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the thickness of the 
intermediate body (12) is less than half the thickness measured between the bearing 

surfaces (4) for the linings (3). 
A wheel in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that when viewed 
sectioned through a plane containing the axis of rotation (6) of the wheel (1), the 

intermediate body (12) has a cross-section which is substantially symmetrical in relation 
to an axis (13) intersecting the said axis of rotation (6) of the wheel. 
A wheel in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the intersecting axis (13) is 
perpendicular to the axis of rotation (6) of the wheel and the intermediate zone forms a 

symmetrical, right body.  
 
A wheel in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the intersecting axis (13) of 
relative symmetry is at an incline to the perpendicular in relation to the axis of rotation 

(6) of the wheel and the intermediate zone (10) forms a slightly tapering body. 
A wheel in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the joining means (14) consist 
of a gradual increase in the material from the intermediate body (12) to the peripheral 

part and this increase in material begins with a wide junction curve (15) of predetermined 
form and value. 
A wheel in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that between each 
of the outer faces (4) of the peripheral part (11) and the associated face of the means (15) 

for joining the intermediate body (12) to this peripheral part (11), the wheel has an inner, 
cylindrical supporting surface (16) notably enabling the wheel to be centred on a 

reprofiling machine for the running surfaces. 
A wheel in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that between the 
running surface 
and the part provided with the bearing surfaces (4) for the brake linings 
(3), each flank of the wheel has an annular groove (17, 18) with a V-section of which 

that wall (19) of its two walls (19, 20) which is the nearest to the hub forms a male, 
cylindrical supporting surface coaxial with the axis of rotation of the wheel.
