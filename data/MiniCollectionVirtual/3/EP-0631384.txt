<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric acoustic wave device includes a substrate 
and a piezoelectric plate. The piezoelectric plate includes a 

resonating part, and has a top electrode at least on the top 
surface of the resonating part. The substrate and the 

piezoelectric plate are directly bonded at an area where they are 
in contact with each other by a chemical bond such as a covalent 

bond and an ionic bond. A depression is formed in at least one 
of the substrate and the piezoelectric plate. The method of 

manufacturing the piezoelectric acoustic wave device includes the 
steps of forming a depression in at least one of the substrate 

and the piezoelectric plate, filling the depression with an 
intermediate support layer, cleaning the surfaces of the 

substrate and the piezoelectric plate to directly bond to each 
other by a chemical bond, forming electrodes, and removing the 

intermediate support layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a piezoelectric resonating
device used for high frequency resonators and filters. The
invention also relates to a method of manufacturing the
piezoelectric resonating device.With the recent development of miniaturized high
frequency communication devices such as portable telephones,
there is a demand for piezoelectric devices
(resonators and filters), used for these communication devices,
which are smaller and have a higher frequency.Conventional piezoelectric resonating devices have
been miniaturized by improving ways to support the packages and
piezoelectric plates. The piezoelectric plates of conventional
piezoelectric resonating devices have been thinned to raise
the frequencies of the devices. One conventional piezoelectric
resonating device, a quartz resonator, is explained by
referring to Fig. 6.Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of a conventional quartz
resonator. In Fig. 6, 51 is a quartz plate abraded to a
thickness at which the plate can resonate at a preferable
frequency. Exciting electrodes 52 are fixed to both surfaces of
the quartz plate. Conductive adhesive 53 is used to fix two 
sides of quartz plate 51 to a package 54 while maintaining
continuity between exciting electrodes 52 and a lead electrode
55.A piezoelectric resonating device cannot operate or
has poor properties unless the resonating part is highly free
from the substrate and the like. Therefore, in this conventional
quartz resonator, quartz plate 51 is supported by fixing only two
sides of the plate to package 54.Since it is extremely difficult to treat an extremely
thin piezoelectric plate with photolithography, film forming
processes, mounting processes and the like, an acceptable minimum
thickness of the plate is about 50µm. The thickness of the
piezoelectric plate should be at least about 50µm so that the
plate cannot be bent or cracked during an abrading treatment.Quartz plates generally used for high frequency
resonators are AT-cut quartz plates since the plates have small
frequency deviations, which are caused by a change in
temperature. The resonant frequency is in inverse proportion to
the thickness of the quartz plate, and the fundamental resonant
frequency of an about 50µm thick quartz plate is 35MHz. In
other words, it is difficult to manufacture a quartz plate with a
resonant frequency higher than 35MHz. Thinning a quartz plate
also becomes more difficult as the area of the plate becomes
large. From EP-A1-0 503 892 a piezoelectric resonating device is
known with a substrate and a
