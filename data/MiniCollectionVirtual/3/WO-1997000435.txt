<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (2) for connecting an ampule (8) to a clinical instrument has been developed. The adapter (2) allows the continuous connection of the ampule (8) to the instrument so that the contents of the ampule (8) could remain protected from exposure to air, and aliquots of solution from the ampule (8) can be periodically, and easily, withdrawn from the ampule (8). In addition, the preferred embodiment permits usage of much of the contents of the ampule (8) and helps reduce the risk of technician exposure to the sharp glass edges of the open ampule.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AMPULE ADAPTERBACKGROUNDThe present invention deals with a device (an adapter) which allows the connection of an ampule to an instrument, so that the instrument can periodically withdraw samples from the ampule.In the use of clinical instruments, it is often desirable to utilize control materials which are packaged in ampules. Ampules, typically made of glass, are inert and generally retain the sample in a stable form . longer than if it were packaged in a container made of a different material. The disadvantages of an opened ampule include 1. there remains exposed a sharp edge of glass which is potentially dangerous to laboratory personnel, 2. there existed a risk of decomposition of the contents ofthe ampule when exposed to air and 3. there has been no way to keep the opened ampule in such a position that samples could easily be withdrawn from the ampule.Existing techniques in use now for sampling from ampules require the user to manually move the ampule to a tube that withdraws samples from the ampule. Not only does this require technician time, preventing the worker from attending to other tasks in the laboratory, but it also allows for more exposure ofthe sample to air, thus risking degradation ofthe sample. Existing procedures are also variable due to the non-reproduceability of laboratory technique from worker to worker. 

SUMMARYAn adapter for connecting an ampule to a clinical instrument has been developed. The adapter allows the continuous connection ofthe ampule to the instrument so that the contents ofthe ampule could remain protected from exposure to air and aliquots of solution from the ampule can be periodically, and easily, withdrawn from the ampule. In addition, the preferred embodiment permits usage of much ofthe contents ofthe ampule and helps reduce the risk of technician exposure to the sharp glass edges ofthe open ampule.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1 shows a side view ofthe adapter. Figure 2 shows an elevated view of the adapter. Figure 3 shows a view into the adapter. Figure 4 shows a view of an adapter actually in use, connecting the ampule to an instrument.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONAn adapter for connecting an ampule to an instrument has been developed. The adapter allows for the continuous connection of an opened ampule to an instrument, thus allowing the instrument to withdraw samples whenever necessary, without requiring intervention by the laboratory technician. The technician can be doing other tasks in the laboratory, thus providing a more cost- effective use ofthe

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. An adapter for connecting an ampule or other container to an instrument, said adapter being formed as a unitary plastic rigid or semi-rigid unit and comprising; a cylindrical body having opposite ends and a central bore defining a central axis of said cylinder therethrough; a partial closure to said body at one end terminating in an aperture about said axis; a tapered joint projecting from said apertaure and having an outer shape emulating that of a syringe outlet and an inner bore tilted with respect to said axis such that when said joint is positioned horizontally, said axis and said cylindrical body are angled to the horizontal; indicia associated with said body identifying when said cylindrical body is angled upwardly with respect to said joint in a horizontal position; said bore of said cylindrical body adapted to receive and hold an ampule with said ampule substantially filling said bore of said cylindrical body
2. An adapter of claim 1 in which said angle is obtuse.
3. An adapter of claim 1, wherein said cylindrical body contains ribs on at least one of an outer or bore facing surface.
4. An adapter of claim 1 which additionally contains a portion through which a material can be injected into said ampule or said adapter via use of a syringe.
5. An adapter of claim 1 which additionally contains a flexible portion which allows bending between the joint and cylindrical body and opening of an ampule inserted therein. 


6. A unitary at least semi-rigid adapter for connecting an ampule to an instrument in lieu of a syringe, said adapter being made of plastic and comprising a. an outlet having the tapered design of a syringe outlet b. communicating at an obtuse angle with a body adapted to receive an ampule substantially entirely therein and c. said outlet and body being angled to permit a needle to extend without obstruction through said outlet and into a broken end of any ampule located within said body.
7. An adapter for connecting an ampule-type container of a fluid to an instrument for fluid withdrawal said adapter being fabricated of a rigid or semiÂ¬ rigid material to comprise: a body portion in the form of a cylindrical wall extending a length in an axial direction for holding an ampule and having a dome-shaped end; the dome-shaped end being terminated with a tapering cylindrical syringe adapter portion set at an angle to said body portion and of a diameter a small fraction of a diameter of said body portion; said body portion having approximately a third ofthe cylindrical wall thereof removed form an end opposite said dome-shaped end over approximately a half the axial length ofthe cylindrical body portion; said cylindrical body portion further having a plurality of gripping ridges extending, on opposite sides of said cylindrical body portion, a short distance therearound over substantially the entire axial length of said cylindrical body portion to facilitate gripping; and said cylindrical body portion having on an interior surface thereof, a plurality of internal ribs extending axially within said cylinder and protruding progressively farther inwardly from said interior surface in the direction of said dome-shaped end. 


8. The adapter of Claim 7 further including positioning indicia on said body portions.
9. The adapter of Claim 8 where said indicia is in the shape of an arrow.
10. The adapter of Claim 9 wherein said indicia is adjacent a region of removed cylindrical wall.
11. The adapter of Claim 10 further including a flexible portion which allows bending ofthe adapter and opening of an ampule inserted therein.
12. The adapter of Claim 10 adapted to receive a broken ampule.
