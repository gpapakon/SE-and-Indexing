<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an integrated semiconductor source-detector matrix (10) in which solid state photonic diodes (12a-12i) are configured as LEDs, disposed on a substrate and coupled to electronic circuits so that the diodes can be individually driven to emit light to detect light as may be desired. Providing an integrated matrix (10) of light source and light sensor units disposed in close proximity results in each unit having nearly coextensive fields of view and illumination (157). Apparatus, such as bar code and optical readers utilizing such a matrix are shown, and are insensitive to the diffusion and laminate effects. In alternate embodiments the matrix (10) is coupled to remote sensors (94) or another similar matrix to provide optical communication and interchange devices having high bandwidth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an optical reading apparatus having 
a solid state structure of the type including a substrate, 
a plurality of photonic diodes disposed on said substrate, 
said photonic diodes being optically isolated from one 
another, each of said photonic diodes having a vertical 
structure comprising a plurality of layers. Photonic diodes are operable in either a photoresponsive or 
photoemissive mode. The present invention is particularly 
adapted to improving the performance of optical interfaces, 
optical transmitters, and image detecting apparatus such as 
bar code scanners or readers, optical heads, and other optical 
scanners that can be portable and are required to operate with 
low power consumption. In conventional mark-sense and imaging apparatus, 
the light source and light sensor are discrete and have 
optical paths which generally are not congruent in space. 
Such an arrangement provides a field of illumination that 
includes optical patterns of interest, the indicia, but 
which in general is larger than the light detector's field 
of view (termed herein the detector's region of sensitivity). 
The light sensor generates a signal that is specifically 
responsive to light from the region of sensitivity 
that is incident on the light sensor. When the field of illumination is larger than the 
region of sensitivity, flood illumination is said to be 
present. In this circumstance the process of accurately 
interpreting the information content of the indicia being 
scanned is interfered with, as will now be explained. In FIG. 11 there is illustrated a typical prior art 
device wherein LEDs 121, 121 illuminate a field of illumination 
124 on target 123. A region of sensitivity 122, 
being smaller than field of illumination 124, is entirely 
included within field of illumination 124. The region of 
sensitivity 122 is viewed by light sensor 127 through 
optics 125, with field stop aperture 143 and presents a 
signal to amplifier 129 in response to detected light. Mark-sense detectors are typically employed in 
optical scanning devices, such as bar code scanners or  
 
readers, in which the output of the detector may be 
coupled to decoding circuitry. There are a number of known 
optical effects that can produce errors in the determination 
of transitions between bars and spaces in a bar code 
symbol that is situated on a substrate, including the 
diffusion and laminate effects. The diffusion effect can be understood with reference 
to FIG. 12a and 12b. It results from light, shown 
repres
