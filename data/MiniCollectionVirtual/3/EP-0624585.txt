Process for the preparation of 2-{4-[4-(4-chloro-1-pyrazolyl)butyl]-1-piperazinyl}pyrimidine

(Lesopitron)
of formula I:



characterized in that the reaction between 2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrimidine,
4-chloropyrazole and the carbon chain

of formula (III)


in which X and Y, which may be identical or different,
represent a leaving group chosen from iodine, bromine or

chlorine, a mesyloxy group or a tosyloxy group, is
carried out in a single step in a solvent chosen from the

group comprising dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide,
isopropanol, tert-butanol, toluene or xylene, the said

reaction being carried out in the presence of an
appropriate organic or inorganic base.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said base is an alkali metal carbonate.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that, in the compound of formula III
,
the radicals X and Y are identical.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the reaction temperature is between

80°C and 180°C.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the reaction pressure is between

1.013x10
5
 and 5.065x10
5
 bars (1 and 5 atm).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the

presence of one or more phase transfer agents, such as
tetrabutylammonium salts.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the reaction time is between 1 and

24 hours.
