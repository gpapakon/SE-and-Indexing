<ABSTRACT>
A series tuned resonant autotransformer which passes baseband video 
signals so that more than one non-synchronized channel can be sent over unshielded 

twisted pair wires sharing (40) common cable sheath includes a trifilar winding 
configuration (N₁, N₂, N₃) with a capacitor (C), resistor (R) and ground connection 

coupled between the two secondary windings (N₂, N₃). The transformer is able to 
pass a DC signal as well as a balanced output signal over most of the video 

bandwidth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the transmission of baseband video signals.A need exists to bring baseband video signals to the desk in office
environments, for example, to provide security monitoring, factory production
monitoring and video conferencing. Such information needs usually require the
installation of shielded wiring or optical fiber cables. It would be more economical
to utilize wiring which is already available within the physical structure, i.e.,
unshielded twisted pair cables used for transmission of analog voice signals in the
telephone system. Such a video transmission is offered, for example, in AT&T's
Systimax® Premises Distribution System. (See, e.g., Systimax® Premises
Distribution System Components Guide, AT&T Doc. No. 3726C (Dec. 1990).)Recent proposals have suggested transmitting composite baseband video
signals over a twisted wire pair using active components to compensate for phase
delays. (See, e.g., US-A- 5,130,793.)It would appear to be more economical to couple video signals onto
twisted wire pairs using "passive" rather than "active" components.Transmission of more than one non-synchronized video channel over
corresponding twisted wire pairs which share the same cable sheath presents
particular problems in the amount of induced electrostatic field crosstalk which can
develop between adjacent pairs due to the unbalanced voltage condition established
by the video signals. A passive coupling approach would necessitate use of a
transformer to balance the signals. However, such a transformer would also be
required to pass a DC signal which is present at the low end of the video bandwidth.US-A- 3,731,237 suggests use of an autotransformer including a
trifilar winding for transmission of broadband signals. However, the transformer
cannot pass DC signals.US-A- 4,885,747 uses transformers with three windings to couple
a broadband video signal and baseband data signal onto shielded twisted pair cables.
The baseband portion of the design utilizes a common-mode choke which by its
nature does not balance the voltage portion of the signal. Only the current portion
is balanced thus reducing the amount of crosstalk due to the magnetostatic field but
not the electrostatic field.US-A 5,010,399 uses a transformer with three windings to
modulate a baseband video signal so it can share the same twisted wire pair as the
voice signals. US-A-4766402 discloses an impedance matching device that provides
impedance matching between balanced and unbalanced lines carrying data signals
over a range of
