<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed multi-pixel flat panel displays (e.g., flat panel field 
emission displays (FPFED) or liquid crystal displays (LCD)) comprise spaced apart 

first and second electrodes, with a patterned solid material layer (23) in contact with 
one of the electrodes, exemplarily between the two electrodes. The patterned layer 

(referred to as the "web") comprises a multiplicity of apertures, with at least one 
(preferably three or more) aperture associated with a given pixel. In the aperture is 

disposed a quantity of a second material, exemplarily, a phosphor (512) in the case 
of an FPFED, or a color filter material (e.g., 642) in the case of a LCD. The web can 

facilitate second material deposition by means of, e.g., screen printing, typically 
making possible formation of smaller pho
sphor or filter dots than was possible by 
prior art means. The web also can facilitate provision of spacer means between the 

two electrodes, and can comprise getter or hygroscopic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to flat panel display apparatus, exemplarily field 
emission display apparatus. Flat panel field emission displays (FPFEDs) are known. See, for 
instance, the report on page 11 of the December 1991 issue of SemiconductorInternational. See also C. A. Spindt et al., IEEETransactionsonElectronDevices, 
Vol. 36(1), pp. 225-228. Briefly, such a display typically comprises a flat vacuum 
cell with a matrix array of microscopic field emitter cathode tips formed on the back 
plate of the cell, and a phosphor-coated anode on the front plate of the cell. Between 
cathode and anode is a third element, frequently referred to as "grid" or "gate". As depicted schematically in the above referenced SemiconductorInternational item, the anode structure for a color display exemplarily comprises a 
glass plate with transparent conductive material (e.g., indium-tin-oxide or ITO) 
thereon, with the conductive material patterned into three sets of stripes, each 
covered with a cathodoluminescent (e.g., emitting red, green or blue light) material, 
with the same cathode used for the three colors of the pixel. See, for instance, also 
T. Leroux et al., SID 91 Digest, p. 437; P. Vaudaine et al., IEDM91, p. 197; R. 
Meyer, TechnicalDigestof IVMC 91, Nagahama 1991, p. 6 . However, other 
arrangements are possible, as will be discussed in more detail below. Anode structures for prior art color FPFEDs typically are made by a 
relatively costly, difficult to control process that typically involves photolithography 
and selective deposition of electrically charged phosphor particles. In view of the potential commercial importance of color FPFEDs, it 
would be desirable to have available displays having an anode structure that can be 
readily manufacturable at relatively low cost. This application discloses such 
displays, and methods of making them.

on which the first part of claim 1 is based discloses a process for depositing planarizing material 
in spaces between patterns of regions such as stripes and dots on a substrate. A 
dye/photoresist layer is used for planarizing. FKT-Fernseh- und Kinotechnik, Vol. 47, No. 4, April 1993, Heidelberg, 
pages 231-242, C. Reuber "Flachbildschirme der weite Weg zu Nipkows Vision", 
discloses the use of spherical spacer means in electronic component manufacture. According to the present invention there is provided a display means as 
defined in claim 1. In broad aspects, the invention is embodied in an article that comprises 
novel flat panel display
