<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous silicone emulsion which yields an 
elastomer upon removal of the water comprises a polydiorganosiloxane 

having alkoxysilyl endblocking groups with 
at least two alkoxy groups attached to the silicon atom, 

titanium catalyst and, optionally, a filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous silicone
emulsion which gives an elastomer when dried.Representative of the prior art for such emulsions
is the following United States patents: 3,294,725;
3,383,355; 4,743,474; 4,888,380 and 5,017,672.This invention provides an aqueous silicone
emulsion which yields an elastomer upon removal of the water
and comprises an emulsion of a polydiorganosiloxane having
at least four silicon-bonded alkoxy groups per molecule,
sufficient titanium catalyst to crosslink the polydiorgano-siloxane
by reaction of the alkoxy groups and, optionally, a
filler.An aqueous silicone emulsion which yields an
elastomer upon removal of the water comprises the product
obtained by mixing (A) 100 parts by weight of polydiorgano-siloxane
having alkoxysilyl endblocking groups with at least
2 alkoxy radicals attached to the silicon atom, as an
aqueous emulsion which is ionically or non-ionically
stabilized, (B) sufficient titanium catalyst to crosslink
the polydiorganosiloxane of (A), and (C) optionally a
filler.Our aqueous silicone emulsion is unique in that
the reactive groups which cause crosslinking of the polymer,
to form an elastomer upon removal of water, are all present
on the polymer ends and are not formed by reaction of the
polymer and another ingredient which acts as a crosslinker.
Each terminal group of the polydiorganosiloxane (A) has
either 2 or 3 alkoxy groups attached to silicon. When an
ionically or non-ionically stabilized emulsion of this 
polymer is mixed with a titanium catalyst, the polymer ends
react with each other to form a crosslinked polymer within
the emulsion micelle. When the water of the emulsion is
removed, the crosslinked polymer particles coalesce to form
an elastomer. This elastomer can be reinforced by the
addition of filler.The method of this invention uses a polymer of the
formula

where each R is free of aliphatic unsaturation and is at
least one selected from monovalent hydrocarbon, monovalent
halohydrocarbon and monovalent cyanoalkyl radicals of 1 to
18 inclusive carbon atoms, each D is selected from radicals
of the formula

and radicals of the formula

where each R'' is at least one selected from methyl, ethyl,
propyl and butyl, Z is a divalent hydrocarbon radical or a
combination of divalent hydrocarbon radicals and siloxane
radicals, m is 0 or 1, x is of a value such that the polymer
has a viscosity of from 0.5 to 3000 Pa·s at 25°C. and R is
as defined above.When D of the above polymer (1) is alkoxy silane,
the polymer is of the formula 

where each R
