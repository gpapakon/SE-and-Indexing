<ABSTRACT>
A bearer design (1) to support flat structural components has two crossing pluralities of parallel pairs of bands (4, 5) where girders (2, 3) form the bands. The girders (2, 3) are secured so as not to rotate on the outside of the connecting members (9) in selected crossover regions (8) between the pairs of bands (4, 5).

<CLAIMS>
Bearer design to support flat structural components, with
a first plurality of parallel pairs of bands (2) running in

a first plane, with a second plurality of parallel pairs of
bands (3) running in a second plane, and with connecting

members (9), with the pairs of bands (5) of the second
plane crossing the pairs of bands (4) of the first plane,

and with the connecting members (9) being inserted into
crossover regions (8) formed by pairs of bands crossing

each other (4, 5), and being connected to each adjoining
band (2, 3), distinguished by the fact that the bands (2,

3) have an essentially rectangular cross-section and a
bearing surface facing the connecting member (9), with, in

each case, one narrow side (11) of a band (2) in the first
plane opposing a narrow side (12) of a band (3) in the

second plane, and that the connecting members (9), the
length of which within the crossover region (8) essentially

corresponds to the thickness of the bearer design (1)
formed by the bands (2, 3), and which essentially

completely fill the entire internal cavity of the crossover
region (8), have seatings which extend along the bearing

surfaces of the adjoining bands (2, 3) in the crossover
region (8), on which the bands (2, 3) are mounted so as not

to rotate.
Bearer design as Claim 1, distinguished by the fact that
the pair of bands (4) in the first plane and the pair of

bands (5) in the second plane cross each other essentially
at right angles, that the distance (6) between two bands

(2) of a pair of bands (4) in the first plane corresponds
to the distance (6') between two bands (3) of a pair of

bands (5) in the second plane, and that the distance (7)
between two pairs of bands (4) in the first plane

corresponds to the distance (7') between two pairs of bands
(5) in the second plane.
Bearer design as one of Claims 1 or 2, distinguished by the
fact that the bands are formed as rectangular strips (2, 

3).
Bearer design as Claim 3, distinguished by the fact that
the narrow sides (11) of the strips (2) in the first plane

verge directly on the narrow sides (12) of the strips (3)
in the second plane.
Bearer design as Claim 4, distinguished by the fact that
the strips (2, 3) have recesses, facing each other, in the

vicinity of their crossover points (17), the breadth of
which corresponds to the width of the narrow side (11, 12)

of the opposing strip in each case, so that these can be
fitted into each other.
Bearer design as one of Claims 3 to 5, distinguished by the
fact that the strips (2, 3) and the connecting members (9)

are made of wood, with the grain of the strips (2, 3) in
their longitudinal extension and the grain of the

connecting member (9) running essentially at right angles
to the plane of the bearer design (1) formed by the strips

(2, 3).
Bearer design as Claim 6, distinguished by the fact that
the connecting members (9) are connected with the

individual strips (2, 3) of the adjoining pair of strips
(4, 5) in a single-shear joint, in particular by means of

double nail boards.
Bearer design as one of Claims 1 to 7, distinguished by the
fact that a third plurality of bands is provided for in a

third plane, the configuration of which corresponds
essentially to the configuration of the first plurality of

bands (2), and that the third plurality of bands is mounted
with the cross-sectional areas aligned in the same

direction as the other bands (2, 3).
Bearer design as Claim 1, distinguished by the fact that
the bands (2, 3) essentially intersect at an angle of 60

degrees, and that a third plurality of bands is provided 
for, which also crosses the first and the second

pluralities of bands (2, 3) at an angle of 60 degrees, so
that a hexagonal cro
ssover region is formed.
Bearer design as one of Claims 1 to 9, distinguished by the
fact that selected connecting members (9) have jigs and

fixtures for the attachment of objects, in particular of
flat structural components.
