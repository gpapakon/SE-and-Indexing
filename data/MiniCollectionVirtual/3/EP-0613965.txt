<ABSTRACT>
New formulations for the electrodeposition of a dense, 
reflective tin or tin-lead alloy on a cathode have been 

developed. Such electrodeposition solutions are partially 
comprised of an additive which is comprised of at least one 

nonionic surfactant which is electrolyzed prior to starting 
the electrodeposition process. The electrodeposition 

solution is also comprised of an amount of an aliphatic 
dialdehyde kept low enough so that the solder deposits 

contain no more than 500 ppm of co-electrodeposited carbon. 
The additive and the aliphatic dialdehyde is mixed with a 

solution comprised of an alkane or alkanol sulfonic acid and 
a tin alkane or alkanol sulfonate or a mixture of a tin and 

lead alkane or alkanol sulfonate to form an 
electrodeposition solution. A dense, reflective finish is 

then electrodeposited on a cathode by using such an 
electrodeposition solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to
electrodeposition, and in particular to,
electrodeposition of a dense, reflective tin or tin-lead alloy finish on a
conductive part.Methods of electrodeposition, or plating, of a tin or
tin-lead alloy (hereinafter referred to as solder or solder
deposit) and the compositions of the electrodeposition
solutions have been optimized to electrodeposit solder on to
a conductive part. In the electronics industry, a
conductive part could be the leads of a semiconductor device
package, a printed circuit board, or connector.In particular, in the manufacture of semiconductor
devices, the semiconductor device chip is physically and
electrically bonded to a leadframe. The semiconductor
device is then encapsulated in a package, along with a
portion of the leadframe. An electrodeposition process
then creates a solder deposit on the leadframe by
electrodepositing the solder on all exposed portions of the
leadframe.Following the electrodeposition process, a trim and
form press or tool trims away all unwanted metal from the
leadframe, singulates the devices, and forms the leads of
the device into a predetermined pattern. In the electronics
industry it is preferable that the solder deposit have a
dense, reflective finish.The dense, reflective finish is preferable for quality
reasons. The higher density and smoothness of a dense,
reflective finish reduces the amount of material scraped
from the surface of the deposit during the trim and for
operations. Scraped material from a normal, matte finish 
contaminates subsequently processed leads by adhering to the surface of such
leads. If a dense, reflective surface is deposited, the need to clean, trim and
form tools is reduced because the amount of material scraped from the surface
of the solder deposit is reduced and thus productivity is enhanced.In the past, one problem with electrodepositing a tin or tin-lead alloy
having a dense, reflective finish is that such deposits have 800-2000 ppm
(parts per million) of occluded carbon (organics). The co-electrodeposition of
carbon is not a problem in certain applications. However, in the electronics
field, greater than approximately 500 ppm of carbon co-electrodeposited with
the tin or tin-lead alloy negatively affects the solderability of the deposit.
Therefore, it is desirable to have a method of electrodeposition (and/or use of
electrodeposition solutions) which produces a dense, reflective tin or tin-lead
alloy finish without the co-electrodeposition of greater than approximately 500
ppm of
