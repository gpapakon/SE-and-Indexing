<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing blankets of the type used in
printing and offset lithography, and more particularly to a novel anisotropic
endless printing element having a spirally-integrated reinforced compressible
tubular structure.The printing roll of Ross (US 3,467,009) provided volume
compressibility, ie. an ability to compress in thickness without substantial
increases in lateral dimensions. The roll was made by saturating an elastomer
into a felted web composed of short fibers of paper or cotton linters.In contrast to printing rolls, printing "blankets" were first so-called
because they employed sheet layers in the manner of a blanket. Blanket ends
were clamped into a longitudinal cylinder gap and held tightly in position over
a carcass layer or sublayer. For example, the printing blanket of Duckett et al.
(US 4,093,764) employed alternating layers of short compressed fibers with
elastomer. The printing blankets of Rodriguez (US 4,303,721) and O'Rell et
al. (US 4,812,357) used separate foamed layers and stabilizing hard elastomer
layers to enhance web feed characteristics and dynamic stability.Circumferentially seamless or "endless" printing blankets have been
developed in conjunction with gapless cylinders. Endless blankets are
believed by the present inventors to provide advantages over prior art blankets
used on gapped cylinders because they allow printing over the entire outer
surface and help to minimize vibration at high rotational speeds. However,
their multi-layered construction requires many manufacturing steps and close
tolerances. For example, the blanket of Gaffney et al. (Can. Pat. App.
2,026,954
or corresponding EP-A-0421145)
used separate foam, hard rubber, and optional fabric layers. The
blanket of Bresson (US 5,205,213) employed a stabilizing hard elastomer
between the printing and foam layers. The blanket of Vrotacoe et al. (EP-A-0514344)
disclosed a filament wound, elastomeric seamless blanket having
a number of layers. The trend therefore appears very much to be towards
having concentric, separated, layered, complex structures. The present invention provides a novel anisotropic endless printing
element.The term "anisotropic" as used herein means that the printing
element permits radial compression, in a direction perpendicular to the
rotational axis of the tubular printing element, and resilient recovery
therefrom, while at the same time providing structural reinforcement to resist
stretching and distortion in the circumferential direction around the rotational
axis,
