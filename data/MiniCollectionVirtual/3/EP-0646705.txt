<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method for providing partial load operation in a turbine plant. This gas turbine plant essentially comprises a compressor unit (1), an HP combustion chamber (4) arranged downstream of the compressor unit (1), an HP turbine (5) arranged downstream of this HP combustion chamber (4), an LP combustion chamber (8) which is arranged downstream of this HP turbine (5), operates by self ignition and the hot gases of which act on an LP turbine (11). Reducing the quantity of fuel in the LP combustion chamber (8) to zero keeps the temperature at the outlet of the HP turbine (5) essentially constant. During the lowering of the quantity of fuel in the LP combustion chamber (8), the quantity of fuel for the HP combustion chamber (4) furthermore remains approximately constant and the temperature at the inlet to the HP turbine (5) thus likewise remains constant.

Method of establishing part-load operation in a
gas turbine group, consisting essentially of a compressor

unit, of a first combustion chamber downstream
of the compressor unit, of a first turbine downstream

of the first combustion chamber, of a second combustion
chamber connected downstream of the first turbine, the

hot gases of the second combustion chamber being
admitted to a second turbine, the fuel quantity in the

first combustion chamber remaining approximately
constant during the reduction of the fuel quantity in

the second combustion chamber, characterized in that
all of the turbomachines (1, 5, 11) of the gas turbine

group are operated while supported on the same shaft.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the part-load operation is operated with the

second combustion chamber (8) extinguished.
Method according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that a further reduction in the power

below the part-load operation induced by the first
combustion chamber (4) alone is undertaken by an

adjustment of the blading of the compressor unit
(1, 1a, 1b).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the fuel quantity (4a) in the first combustion

chamber (4) is reduced in such a way that the
temperature at the inlet to the first turbine (5)

remains constant.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the adjustment of the blading applies to the guide

vanes, at least however, one inlet guide vane row.
Method according to Claims 1-5, characterized
in that the fuel quantity (4a) of the first combustion

chamber (4) is reduced for the residual reduction of
the power down to idle.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the compressor unit consists of an LP compressor

(1a) and an HP compressor (1b) and in that the air 
flows through an intercooler (14) downstream of the LP

compressor (1a) and upstream of the HP compressor (1b).
Method according to Claims 1-3, characterized
in that the load reduction is undertaken by preheating

the compressor inlet air (2).
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the preheating of the compressor inlet air (2) is

undertaken by means of a quantity of steam.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the quantity of steam is taken from a steam cycle.
