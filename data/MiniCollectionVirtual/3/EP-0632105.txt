<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copper 
complex azo compounds and dyeing methods using them. In 
particular, the present invention relates to copper 
complex azo compounds capable of dyeing the materials 
for papers, cellulose fibers or cellulose-containing 
fibers with heavy shade and good fastness, and a method 
of dyeing the materials for papers and cellulose fibers 
using them. Well-known dyes capable of dyeing the 
materials for papers and cellulose fibers blue with a 
high fastness include C.I. Direct blue 15, 200, 202, 203 
etc., which are commonly used in the fields of paper 
making and dyeing. However, since dianisidine used as the main 
starting material for the dyes is a toxic chemical 
substance designated as one of the Class 1 Specified 
Chemical Substances in The Hazard Prevention Rule of 
Specified Chemical Substances (Japan), these dyes have 
a common problem that the use of dianisidine is strictly 
regulated and the operation must be conducted in 
extremely severe protective equipment. Thus dianisidine 
is one of the restrictive factors in effecting the 
safety and health control and improving the production 
efficiently.  Although examples of dianisidine-free blue 
dyes include C.I. Direct Blue 67, 78, 106 and 108, they 
have disadvantages of poor dyeing affinity and poor 
fastness as compared with the blue dianisidine dyes. 
In other words, unless dianisidine is used, it is 
difficult to obtain a blue dye having high fastness and 
good dyeing affinity. Under these circumstances, blue 
dyes based on dianisidine are now widely produced and 
used, even though dianisidine is a toxic chemical 
substance corresponding to the Class 1 Specified 
Chemical Substance and a high cost is necessitated for 
the protective equipment for preventing the workers from 
being exposed to this substance. Thus, it has been eagerly demanded for a long 
time to produce an excellent blue dye without using a 
starting material belonging to the Specified Chemical 
Substances such as dianisidine in the fields of dye 
production, paper making and dyeing. As for blue dyes produced from a starting 
material other than dianisidine, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 5623/1989 discloses, for example a dye 
of the following compound in Example 1 thereof: 
   Although this dye is capable of level-dyeing a 
paper making material brilliant blue, a medium blue 
color cannot be obtained due to a greenish hue to limit 
the use of the dye. Another problem is that the dyeing 
affinity and color value are poor. It is eagerly
