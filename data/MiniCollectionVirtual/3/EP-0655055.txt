<DESCRIPTION>
Over the last decade, major advances have been
made in the understanding of the biology of the
mammalian tachykinin neuropeptides. It is now well
established that substance-P (1), neurokinin A (NKA)
(2), and neurokinin B (NKB) (3), all of which share a
common C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2,
(Nakanishi S, Physiol Rev 1987;67:117), are widely
distributed throughout the periphery and central
nervous system (CNS) where they appear to interact with
at least three receptor types referred to as NK1, NK2,
and NK3, (Guard S, et al., Neurosci Int 1991;18:149).
Substance-P displays highest affinity for NK1
receptors, whereas NKA and NKB bind preferentially to
NK2 and NK3 receptors, respectively. Recently, all
three receptors have been cloned and sequenced and
shown to be members of the G-protein-linked "super
family" of receptors (Nakanishi S, Annu Rev Neurosci
1991;14:123). A wealth of evidence supports the
involvement of tachykinin neuropeptides in a variety of
biological activities including pain transmission,
vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction,
bronchoconstriction, activation of the immune system
(inflammatory pain), and neurogenic inflammation
(Pernow B, Pharmacol Rev 1983;35:85). However, to
date, a detailed understanding of the physiological
roles of tachykinin neuropeptides has been severely
hampered by a lack of selective, high affinity,
metabolically stable tachykinin receptor antagonists
that possess both good bioavailability and CNS
penetration. Although several tachykinin receptor
antagonists have been described (Tomczuk BE, et al., 
Current Opinions in Therapeutic Patents 1991;1:197),
most have been developed through the modification
and/or deletion of one or more of the amino acids that
comprise the endogenous mammalian tachykinins such that
the resulting molecules are still peptides that possess
poor pharmacokinetic properties and limited in vivo
activities.However, since 1991, a number of high-affinity
nonpeptide antagonists have been reported. Snider RM,
et al, (Science 1991;251:435), and Garret C, et al,
(Proc Natl Acad Sci 1991;88:10208), described CP-96,345
and RP 67580, respectively, as antagonists at the NK1
receptor, while Advenier C, et al., (Brit J Pharmacol
1992;105:78), presented data on SR 48969 showing its
high affinity and selectivity for NK2 receptors. It is
of interest that most of the nonpeptide tachykinin
receptor antagonists described to date arose, either
directly or indirectly, out of the screening of large
compound collections using a robust radioligand
