<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable damper and isolation apparatus includes a damper housing (14) 
having a channel (18) coaxially positioned about an axis therethrough from a first end of 

the damper housing to a second end of the damper housing. A first compliant fluid 
chamber (19) is formed at the first end of the damper housing and a second compliant 

fluid chamber (21) is formed at the second end of the damper housing (14). A moveable 
damping adjustment member (16) positioned coaxially within the channel (18) forms a 

damping path (18) between the moveable damping adjustment member and the damper 
housing to connect the first and second compliant fluid chambers (19, 21). The position 

of the moveable damping adjustment member is adjusted within the channel to provide 
desired resistance to fluid flow through the damping p

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of vibration damping and isolation and 
more particularly pertains to an adjustable viscous damping and isolation system. Precision structural systems carrying a load, such as a telescopic system, are 
susceptible to disturbances that produce structural vibrations. Such vibrations may be 
contributed to the system by components or assemblies of the structural systems 
themselves, for example, reaction wheel assemblies used to point the telescopic system. 
Since such precision structures tend to have little inherent damping, these vibrations can 
lead to serious performance degradation. Therefore, an efficient means of damping and 
isolating the load carried by the precision structures in a controlled manner is of 
considerable importance. Both active and passive damping isolation techniques have been utilized. 
However, active systems suffer from high cost, high complexity, high weight and high 
power. On the other hand, passive systems require no power, are far less expensive than 
active devices and are inherently stable. Thus, passive damping systems are proven to 
play a significant role in the overall design of precision structural systems. One such manner of implementing a passive system includes the use of viscous 
damping and isolation. Viscous dampers and isolators include a fluid reservoir sealed in 
a damping structure which utilizes viscous fluid sheer forces to provide damping and 
isolation. A viscous damping technique that offers high damping for truss structures, 
known as the D-Strut™, employs a small mechanical viscous damper configured in an 
inner-outer tube strut configuration as shown in Figure 1A. The D-Strut may serve as a 
basic element in a truss structure to isolate a load from disturbances. The PACOSS D-STRUT™, 
shown in Figure 1A, is further described in the article, "An Advanced D-Strut™," 
by L. Porter Davis and Steven D. Ginter, Honeywell Inc., Satellite Systems 
Operation, Damping '91 Conference, San Diego, California, and the article 
"Development of the PACOSS D-STRUT™, by David C. Cunningham, Honeywell Inc., 
Satellite Systems Operation, presented at the Damping '91 Conference, San Diego, 
California, 1991. The D-Strut™ includes three basic elements: a small viscous damper 202, an 
inner tube 206 and an outer tube 204. The damper 202 is placed in series with the stiff 
inner tube 206 which is in turn placed in parallel with the compliant outer tube 204. An  
 
axial displacement across the strut produces a relative
