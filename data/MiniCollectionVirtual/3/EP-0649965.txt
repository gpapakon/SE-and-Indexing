<ABSTRACT>
An overhead mounted door holder assembly for attachment 
between a door jamb (14) and a door (12) for selectively holding the 

door in an open position includes a jamb bracket (16) attached 
to the door jamb (14), a double arm assembly (18) pivotally attached 

to the jamb bracket (16), the double arm assembly having a first 
arm (20) pivotally connected to a second arm (21), with the first arm 

(20) pivotally connected to the jamb bracket (16), and a channel 
assembly (22) having a channel (23) therein. A slide assembly (26) is 

positioned for movement in the channel (23) in response to 
opening or closing of the door, with the slide assembly (26) 

being pivotally attached to the second arm (21) of the double 
arm assembly (18). A spring plunger assembly (28) is supported by 

the double arm assembly (18), the spring plunger assembly (28) having 
a plunger housing (40) configured to retain a plunger (36) 

replaceably connected to a manually turnable plunger 
handle (30), and a lock plate (32) engageable by the plunger (36) to 

prevent pivoting movement of the first arm (20) with respect to 
the second arm (21), effectively holding the door in a user 

defined open position until a predetermined amount of force 
is applied to disengage the plunger (36) from the lock plate (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an overhead door holder assembly 
and, more particularly, to an overhead mounted door holder 
assembly having two pivotably connected arms that are 
lockable to hold open a door. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is often 
necessary for convenience and safety. One commonly 
employed method of holding open a door uses an overhead 
mounted door control device that includes a pivoting arm 
attached between an upper portion of a door jamb and an 
upper part of a door. When the door is to be held open at 
an angle that does not exceed about 110 degrees, an 
overhead mounted door control device is efficient, 
effective, and convenient to install and maintain, is less 
subject to damage by vandalism or accidents, and does not 
present a potential stumbling hazard. However, many conventional overhead mounted door control 
devices are difficult or impossible to disable, with the 
door holding mechanism permanently active. Most 
conventional overhead mounted door holder assemblies cannot 
be selectively engaged, are not easy to install, and do not 
have wear elements that are adjustable or replaceable 
without significant effort and expertise. The door holder should be set to permit easy engagement of 
the door holder, hold the door against minor amounts of 
jostling contact without release, and yet still permit 
closing the door without undue effort. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided an overhead mounted adjustable door holder 
assembly for attachment between a door jamb and a door, for  
 
selectively holding the door in an open position, 
comprising a jamb bracket for attachment to the door jamb; 
a double arm assembly pivotally attached to the jamb 
bracket, the double arm assembly having a first arm 
pivotally connected to a second arm and pivotally connected 
to the jamb bracket; and a channel assembly having a 
channel therein with a slide assembly positioned for 
movement in the channel in response to opening or closing 
of the door, the slide assembly being pivotally attached to 
the second arm of the double arm assembly; characterised in 
that a spring plunger assembly is supported by the double 
arm assembly, the spring plunger assembly having a plunger 
housing configured to retain a plunger replaceably 
connected to a plunger handle, and a lock plate engageable 
by the plunger to prevent pivoting movement of the first 
arm with respect to second arm, effectively holding, in 
use, the door in a user defined open position until a

An overhead mounted adjustable door holder assembly 

(10) for attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door 
(12), for selectively holding the door in an open position, 

comprising a jamb bracket (16) for attachment to the door 
jamb; a double arm assembly (18) pivotally attached to the 

jamb bracket, the double arm assembly having a first arm 
(20) pivotally connected to a second arm (21) and pivotally 

connected to the jamb bracket; and a channel assembly (22) 
having a channel (23) therein with a slide assembly (26) 

positioned for movement in the channel in response to 
opening or closing of the door, the slide assembly being 

pivotally attached to the second arm of the double arm 
assembly; characterised in that a spring plunger assembly 

(28) is supported by the double arm assembly (18), the 
spring plunger assembly having a plunger housing (40) 

configured to retain a plunger (36) replaceably connected 
to a plunger handle (30), and a lock plate (32) engageable 

by the plunger to prevent pivoting movement of the first 
arm (20) with respect to second arm (21), effectively 

holding, in use, the door in a user defined open position 
until a predetermined amount of force is applied to 

disengage the plunger from the lock plate. 
An overhead mounted adjustable door holder assembly 
(10), for attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door 

(12), comprising means (16) for pivotally attaching a jamb 
arm (18) to the door, the attaching means having first and 

second arms (20, 21) pivotally connected to each other; 
characterised by means for holding the door comprising a 

spring plunger assembly (28), the spring plunger assembly 
having a plunger housing (40) containing a plunger (36) 

replaceably connected to a plunger handle (30), and a lock 
plate (32) engageable by the plunger to prevent pivoting 

 
movement of the first arm (20) with respect to the second 

arm (21), thereby effectively to hold the door (12) in a 
user defined open position until a predetermined amount of 

force is applied to disengage the plunger from the lock 
plate. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
plunger housing (40) has a lock notch (44) and an open 

notch (46), the lock notch having a greater depth than the 
open notch, and wherein the plunger handle has a plunger 

handle detent (48) for engaging the lock notch and the open 
notch, respectively, as the plunger handle is rotated 

between locked and open positions. 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
plunger housing contains a plunger spring (38) to bias the 

plunger toward the lock plate. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the plunger (36) is in threaded engagement 

with the plunger handle (30), thereby permitting 
replacement of the plunger when it wears and fails to 

engage the lock plate with required force to hold open the 
door. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the double arm assembly (18) further 

comprises a stop (42) attached to the first arm and 
positioned to prevent movement of the first arm past the 

second arm. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the plunger (36) is symmetrical about its 

axis to allow rotation in the plunger housing (40) and 
 

terminates in a bevelled edge (37) that permits ramped 
disengagement of the plunger from the lock plate (32). 
An assembly according to claim 7, wherein the plunger 
(36) further comprises means for holding during threaded 

engagement with the plunger handle (30), the holding means 
fixing the plunger in position as the plunger handle is 

threaded onto the plunger. 
A door incorporating a door holder assembly according 
to any one of the preceding claims.
