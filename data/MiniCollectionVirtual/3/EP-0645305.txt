<ABSTRACT>
Universal palletizing machine comprising a main 
tower-like frame (1a) which is served by a conveyor (2) for 

feeding goods (11) to an elevated position at a central 
loading region of the tower, where there is a corresponding 

empty pallet (3); a horizontal guide (5) is closed in a 
loop and runs perimetrically around the frame (1a); a 

carriage (6) provided with a vertical spindle (7) can run 
on the guide (5), and a conventional roll of packaging film 

can be fitted on the spindle (7); a presser element (9) for 
stabilizing the goods (11) is furthermore provided above 

the tower.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a universal 
palletizing machine. Systems and machines for palletizing box-like goods 
have long been known that first stack pre-packaged products 
onto the pallet (which is a wood base provided with 
openings for the passage of the forks of fork-lift trucks 
and on which the goods are stacked for transport), 
following automatically a placement logic which is suitable 
to achieve maximum stability. These known machines are then completed by devices, 
normally constituted by a movable extension, by means of 
which it is possible to wrap a film of plastic material 
which, due to its elastic structure, closes the packaged 
pallet together with the goods deposited on it. These devices essentially comprise an automated 
mechanical tool which moves perimetrically around the 
pallet, unrolling a film of plastic material which is 
carried in rolls on the tool itself: this movement normally 
occurs on the ground, and said mechanical tools are wheeled 
for this purpose. In another technical solution, the roll of film is 
inserted in an appropriately provided support that 
oscillates vertically on an upright which is rigidly 
coupled to the palletizing system, while the completed 
pallet rotates on a platform provided with recesses for the 
passage of the forks of fork-lift trucks during work. In any case, in both situations the wrapping devices 
are additions to a basic system and significantly affect 
its overall cost.  Furthermore, the wrapping step necessarily comes after 
the step during which package stacking is completed, and 
therefore requires substantially long working times. Finally, the goods must have uniform and square shapes 
to allow them to be closed in a stable manner with said 
film, and therefore known systems and machines are unusable 
with loose goods which have other dimensions and shapes. A principal aim of the present invention is to solve 
the above described drawbacks of the known art by providing 
a universal palletizing machine, characterized in that it 
comprises a main frame which is shaped like a grid-like 
tower and has a conveyor for feeding goods to an elevated 
position at a central loading region of the tower, where 
there is a corresponding empty pallet supported by a 
platform that is vertically movable, by virtue of 
associated means, from a plane that lies below said 
elevated position and vice versa, at least one horizontal 
guide for the movement of a carriage being provided 
perimetrically with respect to said tower, said guide being 
clo

Universal palletizing machine, characterized in 
that it comprises a main frame (1a) which is shaped like a 

grid-like tower and has a conveyor (2) for feeding goods 
(11) to an elevated position at a central loading region of 

the tower, where there is a corresponding empty pallet (3) 
which is supported by a platform (4) that is vertically 

movable, by virtue of associated means, from a plane (B) 
that lies below said elevated position and vice versa, at 

least one horizontal guide (5) for the movement of a 
carriage (6) being provided perimetrically with respect to 

said tower, said guide (5) being closed in a loop, said 
carriage (6) having a spindle (7) which protrudes 

vertically and on which a roll of packaging film can be 
fitted, a presser element (9) being furthermore provided 

above said tower for stabilizing the goods (11) during the 
vertical movement of the platform (4), said presser element 

(9) cooperating with said platform (4). 
Universal palletizing machine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said central loading region of the 

tower is delimited by corresponding vertical walls (10) for 
containing the goods (11), at least one of said walls (10a) 

being vertically movable and actuated with related devices 
(11) for the access of the goods (11) to said central 

loading region. 
Universal palletizing machine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said means for the vertical movement 

of the platform comprise four chains which are rigidly 
coupled to the four corners of the platform (4) and are 

 
closed in a loop on corresponding pairs of driving and 

driven sprockets, each one of said pairs being mounted on a 
corresponding post of the frame (1a), each sprocket 
being 
located proximate to the ends of said post. 
Universal palletizing machine according to claims 1 
and 3, characterized in that said platform (4) is 

vertically movable in steps that are suitable to align 
each layer formed by goods loaded on a pallet (3) so that 

it is co-planar with respect to said spindle (7) supported 
by the carriage in the guide (5), the completion of each 

step being followed by one or more complete circuits of the 
carriage (6), with the consequent wrapping of the formed 

layer of goods (11) with the packaging film. 
Universal palletizing machine according to claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that said presser element (9) is 

composed of a horizontal plate (12) which is supported by a 
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder (13) having such dimensions 

as to snugly fit between said walls (10), said plate (12) 
having, on its lower face (12a) directed towards the pallet 

(3), protruding elastic lips (14) for the transverse 
compaction of the goods (11) stacked on the pallet. 
Universal palletizing machine comprising one or 
more of the technical features described and/or illustrated 

in the accompanying drawings and for the specified 
purposes.
