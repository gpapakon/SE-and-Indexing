<ABSTRACT>
A front jaw (1) for a safety binding has a housing (2) with two one-armed sole holders (11a, 11b) swivellingly mounted on a substantially vertical bolt (3). A spring arranged in the housing (2) acts on said bolt, pulling forward the bolt (3) guided in a straight line substantially in the longitudinal mid-plane ( epsilon ) of the housing. Concave guiding surfaces (16a, 16b), seen from above, are provided on both sides of the longitudinal mid-place of the housing. The sole holders (11a, 11b) are supported each on their corresponding guiding surface (16a, 16b), rolling on a front roll (15a, 15b) mounted at their front side. In one embodiment, said guiding surface has two adjacent concave sections (116b1, 116b2) which form a point (S) towards the roll (115b).

<CLAIMS>
A front clamp assembly (1;101) for a safety binding, 
comprising a housing (2;102), two one-armed sole clamps 

(11a,11b; 111b) pivotally mounted on a shaft (3;103) operatively 
connected to a spring (6) disposed in said housing 

(2;102) and acting to subject said shaft to a forwards 
directed tension load, and guide faces (16a,16b; 116b) 

provided on said housing on opposite sides of the longitudinal 
center plane (Îµ) for said sole clamps to take support 

on during their pivotal movement to be thereby guided in 
such a manner that substantially no additional thrust is 

exerted on the ski boot in the direction towards a heel 
retainer beyond a predetermined pivot angle, 

characterized in that said shaft (3;103) is disposed substantially 
vertical, that each sole clamp (11a,11b; 111b) 

takes support on its associated guide surface (16a,16b;116b) 
by means of a front roller (15a,15b; 115b) mounted on its 

front side, and that said guide surface - as viewed from 
above - is formed with a concave curvature, the pivoting of 

said sole clamps in the opening sense causing the contact 
point of said roller on said guide surface to be displaced 

inwards. 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the radius of curvature of said guide surface 

(16a,16b) decreases from outside inwards. 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said guide surface (16a,16b;116b) has 

an inner abutment stop (17a,17b;117b) for said roller (15a, 
15b;115b). 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that said sole clamps (11a,11b;111b)  

 
are provided at their rear side with vertically mounted 

support rollers (13a,13b,14a,14b;113b,114b) for the boot 
sole (12s), each sole clamp (11a,11b;111b) having an inner 

and an outer support roller (13a,13b,14a,14b;113b,114b) for 
said sole (12s), and that the axis of the front roller (15a, 

15b;115b) of each sole clamp is disposed - as viewed in the 
longitudinal direction - between the axes of said support 

rollers (13a,13b,14a,14b;113b,114b) of the respective sole 
clamp. 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that each guide surface (116b) has 

two sections (116b1,116b2) of concave curvature adjoining 
one another at an apex (S) facing towards said roller (115b) 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 5, characterized 
in that said apex (S) is rounded. 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the farther outwards disposed second 

section (116b2) of said guide surface (116b) has - as viewed 
from above - a rectilinear part (116b2g) adjoining said 

apex (S) and leading over to a concave part (116b2k).
