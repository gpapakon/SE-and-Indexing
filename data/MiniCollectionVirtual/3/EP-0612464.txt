<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seeder including a front chassis (13) supporting furrow-opening tools (11) and a rear chassis (14) supporting members (29) for planting seeds in the soil. This seeder is noteworthy in that the wheels (12) are linked to the front chassis (13) and that locking means (35, 37) fixed between the front chassis (13) and the rear chassis (14) during working allow the free pivoting of the rear chassis (14) with respect to the front chassis (13) about the central articulation (27), eliminating the said pivoting during transport.
