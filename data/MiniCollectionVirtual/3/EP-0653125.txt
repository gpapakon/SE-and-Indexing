<DESCRIPTION>
 DATA COMPRESSION SYSTEM USING SOURCE REPRESENTATIONThis application is a Continuation-In-Part of co-pending application Serial No. 300,037, now U.S. Patent No. 5,136,618 issued August 4, 1992. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a system for compressing or transmitting digital or analog data sequences with a high degree of compression. Background of the Invention It is well known that data carriers, such as telephone and electrical lines, radio and microwave links, optical fibers, and the like have a limited capacity to carry data. There are corresponding limits to the ability of transmitters and receivers to handle data. As a common example, many offices now have telefax machines that allow digital data (obtained by converting the light and dark regions of the document to be sent into a series of data "bits," that is, to a sequence of "l's" and "O's) to be transferred over telephone lines to a receiving machine elsewhere. Because of known physical and electrical limitations of the metal telephone wires, data cannot be transmitted faster than at a certain rate.Furthermore, the "modems," built into the telefax machines, that actually apply the digital data to the telephone lines also have upper limits on their transmission speed. No matter how fast the telefax machine were to be able to convert a document to digital form, if its internal modem cannot transmit more than, say, 2400 data bits per second, the message cannot be sent and received at a faster rate. Finally, the speed at which the telefax machine can scan a document also limits the speed at which a message can be sent.A way to improve transmission speed is to make the machines themselves faster. If the telefax machine is able to scan documents fast enough, if its modem can transmit at 4800 bits per second instead of only 2400, if the 

transmission medium is able to carry data at this rate, and if the receiving device is able to receive at this rate, then transmission speed can be doubled.Another way to improve transmission speed is to use a transmission medium that has a greater "bandwidth," that is, a greater ability or capacity to carry data. Optical fibers, for example, transmit data in the form of light pulses, and as such they have a much greater data capacity than traditional copper wires, over which data is transmitted in the form of electrical signals.Still another way to increase transmission speed is to compress the data to be transmitted. Continuing with the telefax example, assume one wishes to transmit a letter with
