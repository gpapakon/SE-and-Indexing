<ABSTRACT>
In the catalytic conversion of reactants of a gas mixture, in addition to the desired catalytic reaction, an undesirable catalysed side reaction generally also occurs. For adequately good catalytic conversion of at least two reactants of a gas mixture with simultaneously good suppression of undesirable side reactions, according to the invention a catalyst is provided for accelerating the reaction of these reactants, in which the chemical composition of the catalytically active substance is changeable in the direction of flow of the gas mixture. As a result, undesirable side reactions, such as the SO2/SO3 conversion when a DeNOx catalyst is used or the generation of nitrogen oxides in an oxidation catalyst, can be substantially suppressed by an appropriate choice of the chemical composition.
