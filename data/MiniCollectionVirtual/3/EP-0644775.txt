<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a class of binding ligands
for cocaine and other receptors in the brain. Specifically,
a novel family of compounds shows high binding specificity and
activity, and, in a radiolabeled form, can be used to bind to
these receptors, for biochemical assays and imaging
techniques.This application claims priority from US-A-5,128,118
and WO 92/02260.
In US-A-5,128,118, there is disclosure of a family of compounds
exhibiting particularly high specificity and affinity for
cocaine receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors in the
brain of the formula A wherein:
the broken line represents an optional chemical
bond and the substituents at 2 and 3 may be at any position;the iodo substituent may be at o, m, p, or
multisubstituted;R1 = CH3, CH2CH=CH2, (CH2)nC6H5  n = 1-4; R2 = CH3, C2H5, CH3(CH2)3, (CH3)2CH, C6H5, C6H5CH2, C6H5(CH2)2;X = pharmacologically acceptable anion

Sites of specific interest included cocaine receptors
associated with dopamine transporter sites.Subsequently, in the U.S. PCT Application from which
priority is claimed,
the values for R1 and R2 were expanded, such that R1
may be an alkyl of 1-7 Carbon atoms, CH2CR3=CR4R5 wherein R3-R5
are each, independently C1-6 alkyl, or phenyl compounds of the
formula C6H5(CH2)y, wherein y = 1-6. The PCT filing also
reveals the affinity of these compounds for cocaine receptors
associated with serotonin transporters, and confirms, for the
first time, that the in vitro binding reported in the earlier-filed
application, is confirmed in in vivo testing. Specific
disclosure for a variety of applications, including using the
receptors in both PET and SPECT scanning, wherein either the
iodine substituent, or one of the carbon groups is radioactive
(I-123, 125 or 131 and C11) thus providing methods for
scanning for the presence of specific cocaine receptors
appears. Such scanning processes may be used to determine
physiological conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, to
examine in general the density and distribution of specific
cocaine receptors in various parts of the brain and/or body,
to determine the efficacy of neurological treatments aimed at
halting or reversing the degeneration of specific nerves in
the brain, and screening drugs, such as antidepressant drugs. The affinity of these compounds, as reported in the
applications incorporated, is surprisingly high, and compared
with prior art compounds, such as [3H]WIN 35,428, the novel
compounds of these applications exhibit extremely low IC50
values for binding inhibition.Other
