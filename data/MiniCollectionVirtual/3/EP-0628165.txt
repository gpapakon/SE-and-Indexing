<ABSTRACT>
A method of analysing a drilling fluid comprising subjecting a sample of the fluid to an XRF analysis technique and comparing the results obtained with a calibration model to determine the amount of one or more components of the fluid present in the sample. The method is particularly useful for determining solids in the fluid such as barite and can be combined with an FTIR technique which is sensitive to other components of the fluid. A PLS algorithm is used to construct the model from the spectra.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of analysing drilling fluids and is 
particularly useful for the determination of solids in drilling fluids and differentiation 
between the different types of these solids. During the drilling of an oil or gas well, large volumes of solids cuttings are 
generated by the drill bit. These solids are conveyed to the surface by means of 
circulating drilling fluids, often known as "mud", which are often complicated mixtures 
of water, oil, soluble and insoluble minerals, polymers, surfactants and salts. A large 
portion of the drill cuttings can usually be removed from the fluid by means of vibrating 
screens and other solids separators, so that after this cleaning process the fluid can be 
recirculated down the drill string. However, some of the drill cuttings are dispersed as 
very small particles, which cannot be removed by the solids separation process. The 
presence of these fines, often called "drilled solids" (DS), affects the functional 
properties of the fluid. Determination of the concentration of DS is particularly 
complicated by the presence of two other types of solids in the fluid, commercial clays 
and weighting material. Commercial clays are added to the fluid for control of rheological and filtration 
properties. Usually, bentonite or other chemically treated clay minerals are added for 
this purpose. The total of commercial clays (CC) and DS is called "low gravity solids" 
(LGS). Weighting materials are used to bring the fluid to the required density, necessary 
to contain underground formation fluids by hydrostatic pressure exerted by the mud 
column in the annulus. A common weighting material is powdered barite (barium 
sulfate). The concentration of weighting materials is known as "high gravity solids" 
(HGS). It is important for effective control of the properties of the fluid to know the 
individual concentrations of all types of solids. In current well site technology LGS and 
HGS are not measured directly, but are calculated from the density and solids volume 
fraction of the drilling fluid, both of which can be measured. The principle of the 
calculation is that both properties are functions of the volume fractions of LGS and 
HGS. A simple form of these functions is assumed, and from the resulting set of two 
simultaneous equations with two unknowns one can readily solve LGS and HGS. This 
is usually done by direct calculation or by the use of charts which may allow for 
corrections if salts are present. The total concentration of clays
