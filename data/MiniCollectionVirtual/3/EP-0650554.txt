<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a process for operating a gas turbine as part of a steam process, where the gas turbine has an air compressor (4), a combustor (3) and a turbine (5) which drives the air compressor (4). The object of the invention is to indicate a process whereby a gas turbine can be operated at up to a stoichiometric fuel/air mixture. This is achieved in that the air compressor (4) delivers at least the volume of air required for combustion and the fuel gas is cooled to the permissible turbine entry temperature by being mixed with steam that is taken from an external steam process. Alternatively, the gas turbine also works with interheating between a high-pressure turbine (9) and a low-pressure turbine (10), where the exhaust gas of the high-pressure turbine (9) is heated ahead of the high-pressure turbine (9) by means of heat transfer from the combustor gas, which then cools as a result.

A method of operating a gas turbine as part of a steam process, 
wherein the gas turbine has at least one air compressor (4), one 

combustion chamber (3) and one turbine (5, 10) which drives the air 
compressor (4) and delivers shaft output, with the air compressor (4) 

transporting at least that air volume required for combustion, with 
cooling of the combustion chamber gas to the permitted turbine entry 

temperature at least in part by mixing it with steam derived, at least 
at combustion chamber pressure, from a steam source (1) in the form 

of a steam power plant, steam process plant or steam heating plant 
and wherein the waste gas heat behind the turbine (5, 10) is used to 

generate steam in a waste heat boiler (6) which is expandable in a 
steam turbine (14),
characterised in that
 at least part of the steam leaving the steam 
turbine (14) or the steam coming from the steam source (1) or the 

waste heat boiler (6) is heated in an intermediate superheater (15) by 
the waste gas heat behind the turbine (5, 10) and used for mixing 

with the combustion chamber gases. 
A method according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the waste gas heat behind the turbine (5, 10) is 
used for generation of steam in a dual-pressure boiler (12), with the 

steam from the high-pressure section (13) of the dual-pressure boiler 
(12) fed to the steam turbine (14). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the waste gas stream is cooled down to below 
the dew point and that the cooling heat necessary for this is 

preferably used for heating.  
 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the gas turbine operates with interheating 
between a high-pressure turbine (9) and a low-pressure turbine (10), 

with the waste gas from the high-pressure turbine (9) heated through 
heat transfer from the combustion chamber gas in front of the high-pressure 

turbine (9). 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the combustion chamber gas is cooled by heat 
transfer to water and steam prior to entering the turbine (5), with the 

steam used in a separate steam process. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 steam is blown onto the guide blades of at least 
the first stage of the turbine (5, 9, 10) and after cooling of the blades 

the said steam enters the combustion chamber gas.
