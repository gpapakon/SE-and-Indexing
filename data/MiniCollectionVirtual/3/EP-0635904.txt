<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal (2) comprises an outer back-up 
spring (6) and an inner contact body (4). The inner 

contact body is provided with resilient contacts (36) in 
its middle body section (14) that bias against a plated 

inner surface (86) of the back-up spring for electrical 
contact therewith. The back-up spring (6) has on an outer 

surface a gold plated band (82) that serves as a zone for 
electrical contact with a short circuit spring terminal. 

Reliable electrical contact is therefore made between a 
short circuit spring terminal and the inner contact body 

of this terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical terminal comprising
an inner contact body and an outer back-up spring, the terminal
comprising, according to the invention, contacts for making
electrical contact between the back-up spring and the inner
contact body even in a corrosive environment, both the back-up
spring and the inner contact body being plated with a nonoxidizing
conductive material in at least one region of contact
therebetween.In the electrical industry it is common to find the use of
terminals having an inner contact body and an outer back-up
spring. The outer back-up spring is usually made of a metal such
as stainless steel having good spring properties which are not
altered by high mechanical solicitation such as vibration, or
high temperatures, the outer back-up spring serving to increase
the spring force of the inner contact body for increased
electrical conductivity at the contact surfaces of mating
terminals. Due to the back-up spring, the inner contact body can
be manufactured from a good conducting material that also has
good crimping properties for connection to conducting wires,
these materials usually having poor spring properties. Such
terminals are described in the following European patent
application publications 0517076, 0517077, 0517139.EP-A2-0 517 077 describes an electrical terminal comprising
an inner contact body and an outer back-up spring. Figure 7 of
the document shows a side view of an assembled electrical
terminal with resilient locking members formed on the inner
contact body and on the back-up spring serving to fix the
position of both relative to each other, when assembled to build
the electrical terminal. Terminals with outer back-up springs such as described
above, can be used in many different applications, but find many
applications in automobile connectors which are subject to harsh
environmental conditions such as vibration, temperature and
corrosive agents such as salt. Such terminals are also found in
connectors for the detonation of airbags in the event of
collision. Airbag connectors comprise short circuit spring
terminals that electrically connect certain adjacent terminals
thereof 
when the airbag connector is unmated (for maintenance or
repair reasons for example), the short circuit spring
terminal ensuring that the electrical potential difference
between certain adjacent unmated terminals is zero to
preclude unwanted detonation of the airbag. Good
electrical contact between the short circuit spring
terminal and the inner contact body of the adjacent

<CLAIMS>
An electrical terminal (2) comprising an inner contact body (4) and
an outer back-up spring (6), characterized in that the terminal (2)

comprises contacts (36) for providing electric contact regions for making
electrical contact between the back-up spring (6) and the inner contact

body (4) even in a corrosive environment, both the back-up spring (6)
and the inner contact body (4) being selectively gold plated (43, 86) in

the region of contact therebetween.
The terminal of claim 1 characterized in that the outer back-up spring
is selectively plated with a nonoxidizing conductive material on an outer

surface (82) in a region (84) where contact is made with a short circuit
spring contact, the region (84) being large enough to allow for

tolerances in the relative positioning of the short circuit spring and the
terminal (2) in an electrical connector housing.
The terminal of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the contacts (36)
are stamped and formed out of the inner contact body (4).
The terminal of claim 3 characterized in that the contacts (36)
comprise a resilient arm (40) having an embossed contact section (42) at

a free end thereof, the resilient arm beeing prestressed such that the
contact section (42) is resiliently biased against the outer back-up spring

(6).
The terminal of any preceding claim characterized in that the terminal
(2) comprises a pair of contacts (36).
