<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for the pressure treatment of thermoplastic-polymer pre-foamed particles by transferring the foam from a feed tank (8) to a pressure-treatment vessel (10) in which the foam is stored under an inorganic gas at a pressure between 0.5 and 5 bar and at a temperature between 10 and 100  C until the pressure inside the foam cells has increased to a level above atmospheric pressure. The foam is transferred from the feed tank (8) to the pressure-treatment vessel (10) through a pressure lock (9) and the pressure in the pressure lock (9) is at least equal to the pressure in the pressure-treatment vessel (10).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the pressure treatment of 
prefoamed particles of a thermoplastic polymer, comprising 

a stock tank 8 for the prefoamed particles and a 
pressure-treatment tank 10, between which a pressure lock 

9 is arranged, wherein the pressure-treatment tank comprises 
a single chamber.
