<ABSTRACT>
A process for the recovery of cadmium from other 
metals with which it is mixed, in particular zinc, 

nickel, or both, by solvent extraction is 
described. The solvent extractant is a synergistic 

combination of a trialkylphosphine sulphide (R₃PS) 
and a carboxylic acid extractant in an organic 

diluent. A preferred extractant combination is 
triisobutylphosphine sulphide and 

3,5-diisopropylsalicylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to the production of cadmium 
and, more particularly, to the selective extraction 
of cadmium using a suitable solvent extractant 
system. The invention is especially concerned with 
the separation of cadmium from other metal ions, in 
particular, zinc and/or nickel. Cadmium is generally found as a minor constituent 
in zinc ores and is extracted together with the 
zinc during leaching of the ore. As far as applicant is aware, such cadmium has 
usually been recovered by cementation using zinc, 
followed by dissolution, purification, and 
electrolytic deposition. Cadmium is also found, together with nickel, in 
wastes generated during the manufacture of 
nickel-cadmium batteries as well as in scrap 
battery material. It is thus desirable to separate 
the cadmium and nickel in such wastes and scrap for 
re-use. It appears that solvent extraction has not been 
employed commercially for the recovery of cadmium  
 
in view of the fact that solvents have not been 
available which are adequately selective towards 
cadmium. This is particularly so where cadmium 
occurs together with zinc, nickel, or both. It has now been found that the solvent extraction 
of cadmium is indeed possible using particular 
solvent extraction systems. It is, accordingly, the object of this invention to 
provide a process for the recovery of cadmium using 
solvent extraction as a separation step. In accordance with this invention, there is 
provided a process for the selective solvent 
extraction of cadmium from aqueous solutions 
thereof in which the cadmium is present together 
with either or both of nickel and zinc, the process 
comprising the contacting of the aqueous solution 
with an organic phase comprising 0,2 to 1M of a 
trialkylphosphine sulphide (R₃PS) together with 
from 0,2M to 1M carboxylic acid extractant in an 
organic diluent; separating the resultant aqueous 
and organic phases; and, stripping cadmium from 
the organic extractant phase.  Further features of the invention provide for the 
two extractants to be present in substantially 
equal proportions and preferably at a concentration 
of from 0,25M to about 0,5M each; for the organic 
diluent to be an aromatic diluent, in particular 
xylene; for the organic to aqueous phase ratio to 
be of from 1 : 2 to 2 : 1, preferably 2 : 3; for 
the pH of the aqueous solution to be adjusted 
according to the equilibrium pH of cadmium 
extraction when compared with that of zinc and/or 
nickel as the case may be; for the contacting to 
be carried out in a
