<ABSTRACT>
In CVD processes susceptors can be made of a 
thermally conductive ceramic such as aluminum nitride 

which has superior durability with respect to fluorine 
plasma. Such aluminum nitride susceptors (39) can 

include an embedded heater element (43) and/or embedded 
ground or RF electrodes (41) which as a result of their 

embedment are protected from the deleterious effects of 
the processing chamber environment. The conductors (87; 

89, 91; 93) leading to these elements are protected from 
exposure to the process chamber environment by passing 

through a cylindrical member (25) filled with inert gas 
supporting the wafer support plate (39) of said 

susceptor. Alternatively, the conductors leading to 
these elements can be run through passages in a 

hermetically sealed stem (120) supporting the susceptor 
wafer support plate (100). The stem passes through the 

wall of the processing chamber so that connections to 
the susceptor wafer support plate can be made outside 

the processing chamber. Such a stem supporting the 
suspector support plate can also provide passages (144, 

146) for passing vacuum and purge gas to the back of 
the wafer support plate. Vacuum and purge gas can then 

be distributed through passages (150, 151) in the wafer 
support plate as appropriate to its top surface for a 

vacuum chuck and perimeter purge gas flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to susceptors for use in
CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) devices and in
particular to those devices which execute plasma
reactions within a reaction chamber.
This
application is related to US-A-5456757.To function properly, heat-resistant susceptor
assemblies used in CVD devices must satisfy the
following conditions.First, the material used for a heat-resistant
susceptor member must have high heat conductivity,
must not deform, and must not deteriorate at high
temperatures. Because in-situ chamber cleaning by
plasma will be necessary, the material has to have
superior plasma resistance. The susceptor must also
function as an electrode to support a plasma reaction
in the processing chamber. Further, it is important
that the susceptor material have a high purity to
prevent contamination by impurities.Therefore, heat-resistant susceptor assemblies
are conventionally made of metallic materials with
good electrical conductivity. In particular, nickel
alloys such as Monel, Hastelloy, etc. have
conventionally been used to minimise the effects of
corrosion due to fluorine plasma. For these reasons
ceramic materials such as Sic and graphite are also
widely used.However, whether a susceptor assembly was made of
a ceramic material. 
such as SiC, graphite, etc., or a metallic material such as Monel, Hastelloy, etc., its
corrosion resistance to fluorine plasma was not always acceptable. Therefore to
enhance corrosion resistance the surfaces had to be protected by covering them
with a protective film.Also, resistance heating elements are sometimes provided inside parts of
the susceptor assembly, e.g. the susceptor plate. The wiring connecting such
heating elements to an outside power source must also be protected from the
corrosive effects of fluorine plasma. Therefore, it is necessary to use a material
with superior fluorine plasma resistance for the container and the cover protecting
such wiring.When metallic materials are used. sudden temperature changes may cause
plastic deformation of susceptor members and also create problems with a
protective film. The protective film can begin to peel off due to difference in the
coefficient of thermal expansion between the protective film and the metallic
materials.When ceramic materials. such as SiC, graphite, etc., are used, plastic
deformation does not easily occur. But when plasma cleaning is frequently
performed, the protective film starts peeling off creating a problem.Therefore, susceptor assemblies using metallic and ceramic materials had
proble

A susceptor for a CVD chamber comprising a wafer

therein emerges, and a support member for the

 the support member
comprises a support stem (120) in the form of a

cylindrical member having a side wall composed of

through said support stem and through holes in

said bottom plate; and
