<ABSTRACT>
A head up display system (10) for a motor vehicle includes a sensor (11), 
display means (20) for forming a video image from the signals received 

from the sensor (11) and a projection system (22, 24, 25, 26) for 
projecting the video image onto the windscreen (12) of the vehicle, the 

projection system (22, 24, 25, 26) including a mirror (26) for deflecting 
the optical path of the projected image, said mirrors (26) being located 

directly in front of a driver of the vehicle at a level outside the normal field 
of view of the driver through the windscreen (12), the mirror (26) being 

arranged; in a head up display mode, to direct the projected image onto 
the windscreen (12); and in a non-head up display mode, to permit direct 

viewing of the video image at a level outside the normal field of view of 
the driver through the windscreen (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to head up displays for motor vehicles.It has been proposed to provide a head up display for a motor vehicle in
which an enhanced view of the road ahead is projected onto the vehicle
windscreen, so that it is overlaid onto the drivers view of the scene. In
this manner, potential hazards which may not be clearly visible to the
driver, may be highlighted.In order to ensure that the objects within the image appear to the driver
to be the same size as the objects in the real scene, the field of view of
the sensor is matched to the field of view which the driver has of the
display. The image is then projected into the relevant area of the driver's
forward line of sight and is arranged such that the driver's own view of
the objects is overlaid with the images of the objects generated from the
sensor, processing and display combinations.To produce an overlaid image of this type, a large field of view is
required. Within the constraints of the motor vehicle which places
limitations on the size of the video display device which may be used and
the optical path length of the projected image, this may be achieved by
the use of a mirror which will bend the optical path. This will also allow
the display device to be positioned behind the dashboard of a vehicle, the
mirror serving to deflect the projected image onto the windscreen.The centre line of the projected image and the centre line of the driver's
forward field of view must also be coincident. As a result, the mirror
used to deflect the projected image onto the windscreen must be
positioned directly in front of the driver at a level below the level of the
windscreen. That is, in a position conventionally used for the vehicle
instrument display. The positioning of a mirror in this way will 
consequently significantly reduce the area available for vehicle instrument
display.WO-A-87 106017 discloses a head up display system for an aircraft
which also provides head down displays for instrumentation. However in
accordance with the disclosure in this specification separate video image
display devices are required for providing the head up and head down
displays which would present packaging problems in the confined space
available in a motor vehicle.US-A-3885095 discloses a head up display system for aircraft in which
the same video image is displayed in head up and in head down display
mode. This does not overcome the instrumentation problem addressed by
the present invention.GB-A-1409743 discloses a head up display system for aircraft

<CLAIMS>
A motor land vehicle having a head up display system (10) said
head up display system comprising:


sensor means (11) for sensing the scene ahead of the vehicle;
image display means (20) for forming an image of the scene ahead
of the vehicle from signals received from the sensor means (11);

and
projection means (22,24,25,26) for projecting the image of the
scene ahead of the vehicle onto the windscreen (12) of the vehicle,

so that when viewed by a driver of the vehicle, the image of the
scene ahead of the vehicle projected onto the windscreen (12) will

be superimposed on the scene ahead of the vehicle as viewed
through the windscreen (12),

   
characterised in that

   second input means is provided by which the image display means
(20) will also provide a flexible format display different from the

scene ahead of the vehicle;

   said projection means (22,24,25,26) including a mirror (26), said
mirror (26) being located between the image display means (20)

and the position of a driver in the vehicle and directly in front of the
driver at a level outside the normal field of view of the driver

through the windscreen, said mirror (26) reflecting light of
wavelengths within a first band of wavelengths and transmitting

light of wavelengths outside said first band of wavelengths;

   the image of the image display means (20) being projected onto the
mirror (26) so that the image of the scene ahead of the vehicle is

reflected by the mirror (26) onto the windscreen (12) of the vehicle,
while the flexible format display is transmitted by the mirror (26)

where it may be viewed directly by the driver, in a head down
display mode.
