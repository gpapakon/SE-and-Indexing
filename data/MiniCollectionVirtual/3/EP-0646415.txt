<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing ultra fine particles is 
disclosed, wherein the method includes wet grinding particles 

with a media agitation mill, wherein ceramic particles having 
an average diameter of about 300 µm or smaller are used as 

grinding media in the media agitation mill. Desirably, the 
media has an average particle diameter standard deviation of 

15 or smaller, a sphericity of 1.07 or smaller, and a density 
of 6.0 g/cm³ or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing 
ultra fine particles for use in raw particles for pigments, 
electron parts, medical products, agricultural products, food 
and the like chemical products. Recently, a demand for ultra fine particles having a 
particle diameter of submicrons is increasing in many 
industrial fields (for instance, high technology fields as 
well as fine ceramics fields). As one means for meeting 
this demand, the use of a media agitation mill has come to 
attention in view of its advantage of cost savings. The 
media agitation mill uses beads (sometimes called balls, 
media or ball pebbles) as grinding media. As a material 
thereof, a metal, glass or ceramic has been mainly used. 
However, beads made of a metal or glass formed during the 
grinding step or abrasive particles or impaired peeled pieces 
thereof generated by abrasion or cracking contaminate a final 
product to cause pollution, resulting in deterioration of 
quality and irregular quality. Thus, since they directly and 
adversely affect the final product, it has come to attention 
to use ceramic beads, especially zirconia beads in which an 
yttria stabilizer is contained, which is less influenced by 
the above factors, and the use thereof is increasing.  Conventionally, in cases where beads are used as a 
media for grinding particles, it is said that it is better to 
use beads having a high density, a small average particle 
diameter, a narrow distribution breadth and a nearly 
spherical shape. Accordingly, a demand on the market is 
increasing for beads made of, e.g., zirconia or other ceramic 
materials, having a high density (when it is the same 
ceramics, the nearer the theoretical density is better), a 
small average particle diameter, a narrow distribution 
breadth and a nearly spherical shape. In particular, since 
zirconia beads have higher density than those of other 
ceramic materials and are abundant in abrasion resistance, it 
is said that a demand for beads made of zirconia having a 
smaller shape, narrower particle diameter distribution 
breadth and more nearly spherical shape will become stronger 
from now on. Beads having a small particle diameter (e.g., 200 µm 
or 300 µm) made of a metal or glass as a material have been 
already on the market, and they have a relatively high 
sphericity. Zirconia beads having an average particle 
diameter of 400 µm are obtainable on the market and put in 
practical use as grinding media. Also, it is possible to 
obtain zirconia beads having an average particle
