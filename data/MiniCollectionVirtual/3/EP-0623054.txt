<ABSTRACT>
A gyratory crusher has two crushing shells (4, 5) defining between them a crushing gap (6). In operation, the crushing gap is adjusted as a function of the determined crushing-shell wear calculated on the basis of reference data on the established rate of wear of the crushing shells (4, 5) in previous crushing operations involving the same or a similar raw material. To adjust the particle size distribution of the crushed goods and obtain the desired particle size distribution curve, the crusher is operated with brief periods of alternatingly different settings of the width of the crushing gap (6) and/or with alternating crushing power or crushing force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling
a gyratory crusher so as to
adjust the particle
size distribution of the crushed goods.Particularly, the invention relates to a method for controlling
a gyratory crusher having a
crushing head with a first crushing shell, and a second
crushing shell defining, together with the first crushing
shell, a crushing gap whose width is adjustable by changing
the relative position of the first and the second
crushing shell in the axial direction by means of a
hydraulic adjusting device, the material to be crushed
being introduced into the crushing gap and a driving
device causing the crushing head to execute a gyratory
pendulum movement.In the operation of such gyratory crushers, the
crushing head is so adjusted that a certain predetermined
width of the gap between the first, inner crushing
shell and the second, outer crushing shell is obtained.
The adjustment operation is performed manually and in
such a manner that there is a certain safety margin up
to maximum permissible crusher load. Since the load on
the crusher will vary during the crushing operation, too
narrow a gap would involve the risk of overload on the
crusher with ensuing damage. As crushing proceeds, the
shell surfaces are worn, which increases the gap width,
thereby reducing productivity. To counteract this development,
the axial position of the crushing head is
adjusted gradually, either manually or automatically, to
obtain the gap width as originally set.Swedish Patent Specification 8601504-7 (SE-B-456,798)
teaches a method for controlling such a gyratory crusher
in order to avoid damage caused by caking in the crushing 
chamber between the outer and the inner crushing shell.
Caking may arise if the material is supplied incorrectly
or if the composition of the material supplied is not
right (e.g. if the material contains too much moisture or
too many pieces of stone which are harder than the remaining
material). Thus, caking may cause high, but brief load
peaks resulting in brief pressure increases, so-called
pressure surges. Prior-art crushers are therefore equipped
with a load-relieving system dealing with such temporary
load peaks. In the above Swedish patent, such a system
for dealing with temporary load peaks is combined with
adjustment based on a determined value of the number of
pressure surges in the hydraulic fluid of the adjusting
device that exceed a predetermined pressure level in a
given period of time, the relative position of the crushing
shells being changed depending on

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling a gyratory crusher having
a frame (16) supporting a crushing head (3) with a

first crushing shell (4), and a second crushing shell (5)
defining, together with the first crushing shell (4), a

crushing gap (6), whose width is adjustable by changing
the relative position of the first and the second crushing

shell (4, 5) in the axial direction by means of a hydraulic
adjusting device (15), the material to be crushed

being introduced into the crushing gap (6), and a driving
device (10) causing the crushing head (3) to execute a

gyratory pendulum movement, characterised in that the particle size
distribution is adjusted to the desired

particle size distribution curve
by operating the crusher, such that the width of the

crushing gap (6) periodically and with pre-set operational
time periods, changes briefly between two crushing gap

settings, at least one of the two crushing gaps being determined
by a pre-set, selected gap width (6) and at

least one being determined by a pre-set, selected maximum
crushing power or maximum crushing force; and that

the relative positions of the crushing shells (4, 5)
are readjusted during the operational time periods by simultaneously

monitoring the relative axial position of the crushing
head (3) in relation to the frame of the crusher, and

monitoring the set maximum crushing power or crushing
force.
A method according to claim 1, comprising the
step of operating said crusher during operational time

periods with a set maximum crushing power or crushing
force while monitoring the relative axial position of the

crushing head (3) in relation to the frame (16) of the
crusher to avoid any direct contact between the two

crushing shells (4, 5).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, comprising the
