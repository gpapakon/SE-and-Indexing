<ABSTRACT>
The method for obtaining oligosaccharides starts with the allylation of position (3') of β-lactosides followed by the controlled 
benzylation which leads to perbenzylated and partially benzylated compounds. The latter are glycosylated in position 3, 

not benzylated, with a donor of α-L-fucopyranosyl to yield protected trisaccharides. These and perbenzylated β-lactosides are desallylated 
and, later, are glycosylated with a donator of 2-azido-2-desoxy-α-D-galactopyranosyl to yield protected tetrasaccharides 

and trisaccharides, respectively. The debenzylation of said products accompanied by the reduction of the azydo group and 
simultanious acetylation of the amino group produces intermediary products which, by O-desacetylation, leads respectively to the 

final tetrasaccharides and trisaccharides. The resulting oligosaccharides produce, in vitro, inhibition of the mitosis of astrocytes 
and tumoral cells of the nervous system and, for this reason, could be used for controlling the glial scar and for the treatment of 

tumours of the nervous system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to
oligosaccharides and medicinal preparations
containing active organic ingredients.Neuronal death or injury is always associate with an
increase in the number, size and fibrous appearance of
astrocytes. The transition of astrocytes from a quiescent
condition to a reactive state has a great clinical significance
because it gives way to glial scarring, a process
which remains one of the main problems facing the functional
recovery of the central nervous system. After a
lesion, the proliferation of astrocytes precedes the axon
growth and inhibits their passage through the area affected,
thus making a restoration of synapsis impossible. Therefore,
the repair of the central nervous system requires
an outside intervention in order to modify the relative
development of glial proliferation and axonal growth.
The purification of the natural substances involved in
the control of the glial cell division or in the synthesis
of molecules similar to those natural substances is
of paramount importance.In recent studies we have demonstrated the existence
in the brain of healthy rats of mitogen inhibitors for astrocytes
whose levels undergo a considerable reduction
following the appearance of a lesion We have also postulated
that the structural domain responsible for such an
inhibition could be a carbohydrate complex related to blood
groups A H or Lewis (Nieto-Sampedro, M. and Broderick, J.T.
(1988). A soluble brain molecule related to epidermal
growth factor receptor is a mitogen inhibitor for astrocytes,
J. Neurosci. Res. 22:28-35). We have moreover 
corroborated that oligosaccharides having structures similar
to the blood groups are capable of inhibiting the "in vitro"
proliferation of astrocytes.European patent EP 0394971 (31st October 1990) claims
the use of "inhibitors, containing oligosaccharides, of
endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis." The patent
refers to compounds which contain 6-8 saccharides in their
molecule. Mention may also be made of European patent EP
0208623 (14th January 1987) under the title "The use of
O-poly- and oligosaccharides for the obtention of active
medicaments for the pathology of conjunctival tissues."The compounds of the present invention
are new and there is, therefore, nothing published
so far concerning their synthesis.The present invention as claimed relates to
oligosaccharides acting as mitogen inhibitors for astrocytes
and tumor cells of the nervous system, probably,
analogous to natural inhibitors, and describes their
inhibitory activity as well as
