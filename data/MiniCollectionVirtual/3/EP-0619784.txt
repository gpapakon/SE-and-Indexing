A tubeless tyre comprising a carcass reinforcement 
(1) integral with bead wires (2) of beads (B), and 

covered internally with a layer of rubber (6) of low 
rigidity which is impermeable to the inflation air, the 

beads being covered at least in their part in contact 
with the rim by circumferential profiles (7) called 

protectors, formed of non-impermeable rubbers of high 
rigidity, characterised in that the protectors are 

partly covered at least radially on the inside and 
axially towards the inside by a layer of impermeable 

mix (8) of air permeability coefficient at 80°C less 
than 


21 x 10

and of a thickness l of between 0.1 and 1 mm, covering 

the radially inner part of the protector (7) over an 
axial length L0 such that the ratio L0/L1 of L0 to the 

axial width L1 of the bead (B) is between 0.2 and 0.7. 
A tyre according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the layer of impermeable mix (8) is extended on the 

inside in a radial direction on the surface of the 
protector which faces the inflation air by a layer of 

impermeable mix of a thickness l' of between 0.1 and 
2 mm, ensuring the continuity with the inner rubber 

(6).  
 
A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the layer of impermeable mix (8) 

has an air permeability coefficient at 80°C less than

A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the layer of impermeable mix (8) 

has a value of modulus at 10% elongation E10 = force/initial 
section of between 1.5 and 8 MPa. 
A method permitting the production of the tyre 
described in one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that the protector profile (7) provided with its layer 
of impermeable mix (8) is laid on the building drum or 

on the blank of the raw tyre in a single operation. 
A method permitting the production of the tyre 
described in one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that the layer of impermeable mix (8) is laid on the 
raw or cured tyre. 
A method permitting the production of the tyre 
described in one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that the layer of impermeable mix (8) is obtained by 
application of a fluid dispersion of the constituents 

of the mix on the raw or cured tyre.
