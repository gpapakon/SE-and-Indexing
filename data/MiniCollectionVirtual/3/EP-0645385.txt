<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of our 
co-pending application, serial number 08/122,266 filed 
9/16/93. This invention generally pertains to heterocyclic 
carbon compounds having drug and bio-affecting 
properties and to their preparation and use. In 
particular the invention is concerned with 1,4-disubstituted 
piperazine derivatives wherein one 
substituent moiety is a cyclobutenedione-substituted 
indol-3-yl-alkyl group and the other moiety is a 
pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl ring. These compounds 
possess a unique serotonergic profile that renders 
them useful in treatment of vascular headaches such as 
migraine or cluster type. Archer disclosed a large series of CNS-depressant 
indolylalkylpiperazines in U.S. 3,188,313. Among a 
large number of possible substituents on the 4-nitrogen 
atom of the piperazine ring was pyrimidine. 
In U.S. 3,562,278, Archer disclosed and claimed a 
series of 1-indolylethyl-4-substituted-piperazines. 
Among the possible 4-substituents listed is 2-pyrimidinyl. 
The pharmacologic action disclosed for 
these art compounds is general CNS and psychomotor depression 
which bear no relationship to an antimigraine 
therapeutic agent. Dowie, etal. disclosed a series of 3-alkylamino-indole 
derivatives as being potentially useful for the 
treatment of migraine in a published patent 
application, GB 2,124,210. One member of this series 
of compounds was specifically claimed in a later 
patent application of Oxford, GB 2,162,522, published 
February 5, 1986. This particular compound is known 
in the literature as sumatriptan(i).  A series of novel indoline derivatives were 
disclosed February 7, 1990 by Manoury, etal., in 
European patent application EPA 354,094. These 
compounds are described as being useful for treatment 
of various CNS disorders including depression, anxiety 
and migraine. Included among these art compounds are 
those of formula (ii) 
wherein R⁴ is aryl, pyridine or quinoline moieties. Smith, et al. in U.S. 4,954,502 have disclosed a 
series of 1,4-disubstituted piperazine derivatives of 
formula (iii) which are useful as antidepressant 
agents. 
The indolyl substituents R³ and R⁴ were hydrogen, 
alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halogen, carboxamide, and 
trifluoromethyl. Another series of antidepressant 1, 4-disubstituted 
piperazines where pyrimidine moieties 
were used instead of pyridine was set forth by Smith, 
et al. in U.S. 5,077,293. The most relevant background is believed to be 
our earlier work which disclosed antimigraine 
alkoxypyrimidine
