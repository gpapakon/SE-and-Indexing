<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a class of
dicationic phosphonium and ammonium surfactants which
enhance the chemiluminescence produced by the
decomposition of chemiluminescent compounds,
particularly 1,2-dioxetanes triggered by activating
agents such as chemical reagents, including enzymes.
Enhancers are substances which increase the amount of
chemiluminescence emitted by a chemiluminescent
compound. The enhancer may act by increasing the
fluorescence quantum yield of the light-emitting species
or by increasing the percentage of molecules which
produce an electronically excited state product. For
the purposes of this invention, enhanced
chemiluminescence means that the total light emitted,
the maximum light intensity and/or the ratio of light
intensity of the reaction compared to the background is
greater than that observed in the absence of the
enhancer.The detection and quantitation of biological
molecules has been accomplished historically with
excellent sensitivity by the use of radiolabeled
reporter molecules. Recently numerous non-radioactive
methods have been developed to avoid the hazards and
inconvenience posed by radioactive materials. Methods
based on enzyme-linked analytes offer the best
sensitivity since the ability to catalytically turn over
a substrate to produce a detectable change achieves an
amplification. Substrates which generate color,
fluorescence or chemiluminescence have been developed,
the latter achieving the best sensitivity. In 
particular, the use of enzyme-triggered chemiluminescent
1,2-dioxetanes has achieved extremely high sensitivity
for detection of enzyme-linked analytes.Further increases in assay sensitivity or
speed are needed to expand the range of utility of
chemiluminescence-based methods by permitting the
detection of analytes present in smaller quantities or
reducing the amount of time and/or reagents required to
perform the assay. One way to increase the speed and
sensitivity of detection in an enzymatic
chemiluminescent assay is through the use of reagents
which generate light with a higher efficiency or for a
greater length of time. This result may be obtained by
using chemiluminescent substrates with a higher inherent
chemiluminescence efficiency or by the use of enhancer
substances which increase the efficiency of light
emission.In addition to increasing light emission,
enhancer substances should ideally also be stable under
conditions of use. It is desirable that the rate of the
chemiluminescence reaction in the presence of the
enhancer be relatively
