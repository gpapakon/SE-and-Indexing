<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copper-corrosion inhibitors in or 
for distillate fuel compositions; and to use of such fuels to reduce 
copper corrosion in fuel delivery systems and internal combustion 
engines. It is well known that elemental sulfur, hydrogen sulfide and 
other sulfur compounds, contained in hydrocarbon streams are corrosive 
and damaging to metal equipment, particularly copper and copper 
alloys. Sulfur and sulfur compounds may be present in varying concentrations 
in the refined fuel and additional contamination may take 
place as a consequence of transporting the refined fuel through 
pipelines containing sulfur contaminants. Sulfur has a particularly 
corrosive effect on equipment such as brass valves, gauges and in-tank 
fuel pump copper commutators. A commonly used technique for inhibiting corrosion of copper, 
steel or copper alloys in fuel systems is by the use of corrosion 
inhibitors. These additives are either sulfur scavengers or metal 
deactivators that coat metal surfaces preventing sulfur components to 
react with the metal. Many such corrosion inhibitors are known. For 
example, U.S. Patent 3,663,561 discloses 2-hydrocarbylthio-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazoles 
which are stated to be useful as sulfur scavengers 
and U.S. Patent 5,035,720 relates to a corrosion inhibiting composition 
comprising an oil-soluble adduct of a triazole and a basic 
nitrogen compound. It would be desirable to have a copper corrosion inhibitor 
which would protect copper at low treat rates when exposed to a 
variety of fuels under different conditions and which would not 
produce high levels of insolubles or cause injector sticking in diesel 
engines.  This invention relates to a distillate fuel composition 
having improved copper corrosion properties which comprises a major 
amount of distillate fuel and an amount effective to provide copper 
corrosion protection of a synergistic additive combination of 
(a) a 2,5-dihydrocarbyldithio-1,3,4-thiadiazole of the 
formula 
 
where R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen or R³S where R³ is a 
hydrocarbyl group containing 1 to 16 carbon atoms, with the proviso 
that at least one of R¹ and R² is not hydrogen, and (b) an adduct of tolyltriazole and a basic nitrogen compound 
selected from the group consisting of polyamines, alkoxyamines, 
aryloxyamines and monoalkyleneamines. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for 
reducing copper corrosion in a fuel delivery system or internal 
combustion engine by operating the fuel delivery system or internal
