<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is new
heterocyclic compounds having a pharmacological activity
in the activation of potassium channels.Activators of potassium channels or potassium
agonists have the property of activating the potassium
channels of the cell membrane by opening these channels
or prolonging their opening. This results in transmembrane
ionic movements and, inter alia, a decrease in
free intracellular Ca++ ions which causes relaxation of
smooth muscle fibres.This therapeutic potentiality makes it possible
today for great hopes to be placed in potassium agonists.
Among the most studied fields, arterial hypertension,
angina and asthma are the most often mentioned. Large
families of activators of potassium channels are already
recognized for their relaxant properties.A family of benzopyran derivatives has formed the
subject of many publications in this field.These compounds correspond to the following
general formula A:

EP-0,076,075 describes compounds of general
formula A, where

represents a pyrrolidone.
DE-3,726,261 describes compounds of general formula A,
where

represents a pyridone.Another benzopyran family corresponds to the
formula B below; it is described in EP-0,298,452: 

WO-89/11477 and EP-360,131 relate to benzoxepines
of general formula C:

where X represents a nitrogenous ring connected via the
nitrogen atom to the 5-position of the benzoxepimes, such
as a 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl and 2-oxo-1-pyridyl group for
the first and a 2-oxo-1-pyridyl group or a 4-fluorobenzoylamino
group for the second.R3, R4, R5 and R6 represent a hydrogen atom or a
lower alkyl group and R1 and R2 a hydrogen atom or a
nitrile, arylsulfonyl or nitro group.Derivatives of formula C can be obtained among other things by cyclization of
substituted 4-phenoxybutyric acids of formula D (EP-360 131).
Novel compounds possessing a benzocycloheptene
or benzoxepine ring system, which show notable effects
on the activation of potassium channels, have now
been discovered.The subject of the invention is compounds of
general formula:
 
in which:
Xrepresents C, or CHR, R
being a hydrogen atom or R, taken together with R1,
forming a bond,R1, R2 , R3 and R4 ,R1, R2, R3 and R4, which are identical or different,
represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-C7 alkyl group, it
being possible for R1 to additionally form a bond
with R;R5represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or R5,
taken together with R7, forms a bond or a  O ;
group;R6represents 2-pyridyl, 2-pyridyl N-oxide, 3-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl N-oxide,
4-pyridyl,
