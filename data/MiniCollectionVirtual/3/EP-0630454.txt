<DESCRIPTION>
256 Â±2 -Way Box MountTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a mount for mounting a bundle of wires that are secured by a cable tie to a mounting surface, and more specifically to a box-shaped mount which provides rounded surfaces for contacting a metal cable tie used to secure the bundle to a mounting surface.Background of the Invention The following examples of mounts are known in the prior art; U.S. Patent No. 3,087,700 to Carpenter et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,454,249 to Geisenger and U.S. Patent No. 4,397,436 to Lyon et al.In the electrical industry today there is an increasing number of applications in which use of a metal cable tie rather than a plastic one is highly desirable. One disadvantage of many of the prior mounts is that they have sharp surfaces that are in contact with the metal cable tie strap. These sharp surfaces cause bends and cuts to form in the metal straps that often result in the strap breaking under stress.In addition, many of the prior mounts are limited by their lack of strength, particularly in the direction that the cable tie is to be applied. With the increased utilization of metal cable ties, there is an increased demand to provide mounts that are strong enough to withstand the great stresses to which these mounts are subjected. In particular, it is important that the mount not collapse under the stresses resulting from the tightening of the cable tie around the bundle and the mount. 

Summary of the inventionIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved mount for mounting bundles to a mounting surface. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a mount that can properly be used to mount bundles secured by a metal cable tie to a mounting surface.It is another object of the present invention to provide a mount that does not have sharp edges that would create bends and cuts in a metal cable tie engaged therewith.In general, the foregoing objects are attained by providing a box mount including an integrally formed mount member having a floor and at least two opposing side walls include slots for permitting a cable tie strap to be inserted, wherein the mount member includes means for providing rounded portions of the mount member as contacting surfaces for the cable tie.Brief Description of the Drawings FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a mount embodying the concept of the present invention shown securing a bundle of wires to a mounting surface;FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the mount of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a side view of the mount

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A box mount comprising: an integrally formed mount member having a floor and at least two opposing side walls including slots for permitting a cable tie strap to be inserted, wherein the mount member includes means for providing rounded portions of the mount member as contacting surfaces for the cable tie.
2. A box mount in accordance with claim 1, wherein the means for providing rounded portions of the mount member as contacting surfaces for the cable tie is rolled top portions integrally formed with the side walls wherein the rolled top portions extend slightly below the top of the slot opening. 3. A box mount in accordance with claim 2, further comprising means for strengthening the mount member in a direction parallel to the cable tie strap.
4. A box mount in accordance with claim 3, wherein the means for strengthening the mount member in a direction parallel to the cable tie strap is a pair of opposing end walls integral with the floor and disposed so as to be in between and abutting the opposing side walls.
5. A box mount in accordance with claim 4, wherein side walls include tab portions extending from the ends of the side walls folded over in a direction such that they are disposed along the outer surface of the end walls.
6. A box mount comprising: a mount member having a floor that includes mounting means for securing the mount member to a mounting surface; a pair of opposing side walls formed perpendicular to the floor, each of the side walls having a slot; rolled top portions integral with the side walls; and support means disposed between the side walls for preventing collapse of the side walls. 


 7. A box mount in accordance with claim 6, wherein the rolled top portions are extended portions of the walls that are reversely bent so as to form a rounded tubular section. 8. A box mount in accordance with claim 7, wherein the rolled top portions of the side walls extend slightly below the top of an opening in the slots.
9. A box mount in accordance with claim 8, wherein the rolled top portions are formed so as to provide rounded surfaces of the mount member for contacting a cable tie strap.
10. A box mount in accordance with claim 9, wherein the support means is a pair of opposing end walls each adjacent to and abutting the side walls and formed perpendicular to the floor.
11. A box mount in accordance with claim 10, wherein the pair of end walls further include rolled top portions.
12. A box mount in accordance with claim 11, wherein the mounting means is a screw hole centrally located on the floor.
13. A box mount in accordance with claim 12, wherein the side walls further include tab portions that fold around the end walls for strengthening the structure of the mount. 14. A box mount in accordance with claim 13, wherein the mount member is unitarily formed.
15. The ornamental design for the box mount as shown and described.
