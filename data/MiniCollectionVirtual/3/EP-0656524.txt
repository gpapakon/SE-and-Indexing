<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a spirit 
level, particularly designed for the building field, 

comprising a supporting construction defining a 
reference surface and supporting at least a clear 

material tube, partially filled with a liquid, so as 
to provide, inside this tube, a bubble, which can 

move along the tube, as the reference surface 
arrangement is changed. 
In the level according to the invention 
there are provided lighting means arranged near the 

tube and which can be controllably energized or 
disenergized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
improved spirit level, which has been specifically 
designed for application in the building field. As is known, in the building field, in 
order to control the horizontal arrangement of the 
building parts, as well as to control construction 
portions to be vertically made or to be made 
according to a desired inclination, generally at 45째, 
there is generally used a spirit level, which is 
also simply called water level or bubble. This 
instrument usually comprises a supporting 
construction having a substantially parallelepipedal 
configuration which, in the simplest embodiments 
thereof, defines a reference plane or surface, 
provided to be abutted against the surface the 
horizontal arrangement of which must be controlled 
and at least a clear material tube or small pipe, 
made for example of glass, which is partially filled 
with a liquid so that inside this tube there is 
formed a bubble adapted to be moved along the tube, 
as the inclination of the reference surface with a 
theoretical horizontal surface is changed. On the 
surface of the tube there are generally provided two  
 
marks, spaced from one another, which define the 
position of the bubble, as the surface on which is 
abutted the spirit level reference surface is 
perfectly horizontal. In other more complex 
embodiments, the spirit level comprises, in addition 
to the tube parallel to the reference surface, also a 
second tube, which is arranged perpendicular. to the 
reference surface, as well as a third tube which is 
arranged slanted at 45째 with respect to said 
reference surface so as to allow to easily control 
vertical surfaces, or surfaces which are slanted at 
45째 with respect to a horizontal line. Since, as stated, these instruments are 
usually employed in the building field, there 
frequently occur operation conditions in which is 
very difficult to detect the position of the bubble, 
because of a bad illumination. On the other hand, 
these conditions occur very frequently since, in the 
buildings being constructed there are not provided 
electric systems or since the operator must operate 
in a very reduced space, such as, for example, 
understairs or at room corners, which are not 
satisfactorily lightened. Thus, in such a condition, is very  
 
difficult for an operator to properly detect the 
position of the bubble to provide a good accuracy in 
the work being made. Accordingly, the aim of the present 
invention is to overcome the above mentioned 
drawback, by providing a spirit
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A spirit level, specifically designed 
for the building field, comprising a supporting 

construction, defining a reference surface, and 
supporting at least a first tube of a clear material, 

said first tube being partially filled with a liquid, 
so as to provide inside said tube a bubble which can 

move along said tube as an arrangement of said 
reference surface is changed, characterized in that 

said spirit level further comprising lighting means 
arranged near said tube and which can be controllably 

energized or disenergized. 
A spirit level, according to Claim 1, 
wherein said first tube is arranged parallel to said 

reference surface.

wherein said spirit level further comprises a second 

tube, substantially made as said first tube, and 
arranged perpendicular to said reference surface, at 

said second tube lighting means being provided. 
A spirit level, according to Claim 1, 
wherein said spirit level further comprises a third 

tube, made substantially as said first tube and 
arranged inclined at 45째 with respect to said 

 
reference surface, at said third tube there being 

provided lighting means. 
A spirit level, according to Claim 1, 
wherein said lighting means comprise a lamp arranged 

near a respective tube and power supplied, through a 
power supplying circuit, by an electric power source 

arranged inside said supporting construction. 
A spirit level, according to Claim 1, 
wherein 
said lighting means comprise a light source, 
arranged inside said supporting construction and 

coupled to a related tube through an optical fibre 
cable.
