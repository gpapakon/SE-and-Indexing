<ABSTRACT>
A MOSFET is used to protect a battery driven load 
against the effects of a reverse-connected battery. This 

invention is particularly suitable for use with loads, 
such as those commonly found in motor vehicles, which 

contain semiconductor devices that may be severely damaged 
by a reverse voltage. The source of the MOSFET is 

connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and a 
gate driver circuit is used to provide a gate to source 

voltage sufficient to turn the MOSFET on when the battery 
is properly connected. If the battery is connected in 

reverse, the gate driver turns the MOSFET off, and the 
intrinsic body-drain diode in the MOSFET prevents a 

reverse current flow through the load. In conjunction 
with the MOSFET, a sensing device sends out a warning 

signal which may be used, for example, to turn off a 
portion of the load if the output of the battery falls 

below a level necessary to maintain the MOSFET in a fully 
on condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique for protecting
integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices
against damage when the battery by which they are powered
is connected in reverse. In particular, this invention
relates to a technique of protecting integrated circuit
devices in a motor vehicle against damage from a reverse-connected
battery.The introduction of integrated circuit and
semiconductor devices to motor vehicles has greatly
increased the control capability available to the
designer. At the same time, however, it has created a
need to protect these components against a reverse-connected
battery. Many semiconductor devices such as
microcomputers, for example, contain a diode connected
between the supply voltage and ground. When the battery
is properly connected (i.e., with the negative terminal
connected to chassis ground) these diodes are reverse
biased. When the battery is reversed, however, these
diodes become forward-biased. The resulting high currents
will almost certainly destroy the device. Thus, all such
devices must be protected against a reverse-connected
battery.In many motor vehicles a Schottky diode is connected
in series with the load, so that it is forward-biased when
the battery is properly connected. If the battery is
reversed, the diode becomes reverse-biased and the loads
are protected from reverse currents or negative voltages.
A disadvantage of this technique is that during normal
operation a voltage drop exists across the forward-biased 
diode and heat energy is generated. For example, a 60
volt Schottky diode might generate a 0.8 volt drop, and
with a current flow of 20 amps about 14 watts of heat
energy would be generated. This heat must be transferred
away from the diode. Heat sinks are becoming more
difficult to find in motor vehicles, however, because more
parts are being made of plastic. The metal surfaces in
the engine compartment are generally too hot to serve as
heat sinks.The most attractive solution to this problem would be
a device which approximates as closely as possible an
ideal diode, with an equivalent resistance in the forward
direction of no more than 50 milliohms. One possibility
would be to connect a low on-resistance N-channel power
MOSFFT in series with the load, with its source connected
to the battery and its drain connected to the load.
Properly driven, during normal operation the power
MOSFET's low resistance channel would shunt any current
away from the intrinsic drain-body diode, producing a low
on-state voltage drop. The diode formed by
