<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for providing air cooling to the venturi (11) and the combustion chamber (13) in a low NOx emission combustor (10) as used in a gas turbine engine that includes providing an annular air passage (14) surrounding the combustion chamber/venturi near the aft portion of the combustion chamber (13) passing the air along the combustion chamber (13), past the venturi (11) where the air exits (28) near the front portion of the convergent area of the venturi (11). The cooling air is heated as it passes over the combustion chamber (13) and the venturi (11) and then it is directed back into the premix chamber (12) thereby improving the efficiency of the combustor (10) while lowering the NOx emission in the combustion process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMBUSTION CHAMBER/VENTURI COOLING FOR A LOW NOx EMISSIONCOMBUSTOR - PCT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for cooling the combustion chamber and venturi used in a gas turbine engine for reducing nitric oxide emissions.Specifically an apparatus is disclosed for cooling the combustion chamber/venturi to lower nitric oxide (NOx) emissions by introducing preheated cooling air into the premix chamber for use in the combustion process.2. Description of Related ArtThe present invention is used in a dry, low NOx gas turbine engine typically used to drive electrical generators. Each combustor includes an upstream premix fuel/air chamber and a downstream combustion chamber separated by a venturi having a narrow throat constriction that acts as a flame retarder. The invention is concerned with improving the cooling of the combustion chamber which includes the venturi walls while at the same time reducing nitric oxide emissipns.U.S. Patent 4,292,801 describes a gas turbine combustor that includes upstream premix of fuel and air and a downstream combustion chamber. 

 U.S. Patent 5,117,636 and U.S. Patent 5,285,631 deal with cooling the combustion chamber wall and the venturi walls. The patents state that there is a problem with allowing the cooling air passage to dump into the combustion chamber if the passage exit is too close to the venturi throat . The venturi creates a separation zone downstream of the divergent portion which causes a pressure difference thereby attracting cooling air which can cause combustion instabilities. However, it is also essential that the venturi walls and combustion chamber wall be adequately cooled because of the high temperatures developed in the combustion chamber.The present invention eliminates the problem discussed in the prior art because the cooling circuit for the venturi has been adjusted such that the cooling air no longer dumps axially aft and downstream of the venturi throat into the combustion zone. In fact, cooling air flows in the opposite direction so that the air used for cooling the combustion chamber and the venturi is forced into the premix chamber upstream of the venturi, improving the efficiency of the overall combustion process while eliminating any type of cooling air recirculation separation zone aft of the venturi as discussed in the U.S. Patent 5,117,636.Recent government emission regulations have become of great concern to both manufacturers and operators of gas turbine
