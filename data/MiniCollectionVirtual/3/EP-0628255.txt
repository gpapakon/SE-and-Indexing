<ABSTRACT>
An automatic machine for dispensing an ice-cream portion 
comprises, in combination, a dispenser (10) for dispensing cones 

(18) or the like in an inverted position, and a seat (20) arranged 
to receive said cone (18) in an upright position and to convey it 

to an ice-cream delivery mouth (27). Between said cone dispenser 
(10) and said seat (20) there is provided a cone (18) overturning and 

feed device (12) arranged to receive a cone (18) in an inverted 
position, to overturn it into an upright position and to feed it 

automatically into said seat (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a completely automatic machine of the
coin or token type for dispensing an ice-cream portion, with which
a dispenser for dispensing cones or like containers to contain the
product is associated.A semi-automatic coin or token machine for dispensing an ice-cream
portion is described for example in EP-330252.A cone dispenser which can be associated with said machine is
described for example in EP-A-379238.For a complete understanding of the present invention, the
description and drawings of EP-330252 and EP-A-379238 are to be
considered as forming part of the present patent application, but
are not reproduced for simplicity of description.As is well known to the expert of the art, coin or token operated
machines for dispensing an ice-cream portion (so-called soft
machines) are known in which the customer manually withdraws the
cone from a dispenser associated with the machine and places it in
a seat in the machine, which then conveys the cone to an ice-cream
delivery mouth. After filling, the cone is presented to the
customer who removes it.Machines of this type have the drawback that the fact that the 
customer has to handle the cone is not only inconvenient but can
also lead to mistakes in carrying out the required sequence of
operations as the manner of using the machine may not be
immediately obvious to the customer, and is also questionable from
a hygienic viewpoint.The object of the invention is to obviate the drawbacks of the
known art by providing a machine for dispensing an ice-cream
portion associated with a cone dispenser, in which the entire
cycle occurs automatically without any manual action by the
customer except for inserting the coin or token and withdrawing
the cone containing ice-cream.Said object is attained by a machine having the characteristics
defined in the accompanying claims.The structural and functional characteristics of the invention and
its advantages over the known art will be more apparent from an
examination of the following description, given with reference to
the accompanying drawings which show one embodiment of a machine
incorporating the principles of the invention. In the drawings:
Figure 1 is a vertical section showing the automatic device for
feeding a cone to the ice-cream machine;Figures 2a and 2b together show the ice-cream machine in its
various operating stages.In the drawings, the reference numeral 10 indicates overall a
dispenser for cones or the like, which is preferably but not
necessarily of the type described and illustrated in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automatic machine for dispensing an ice-cream portion,
comprising, in combination, a dispenser (10) for

dispensing cones (18) or the like in an inverted position, and a
seat (20) arranged to receive said cone (18) in an upright

position and to convey it to an ice-cream delivery mouth (27),
characterised in that between said cone dispenser (10) and said

seat (20) there is provided a cone (18) overturning and feed device
(12) arranged to receive a cone (18) in an inverted position, to

overturn it into an upright position and to feed it automatically
into said seat (20).
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said cone overturning and feed device (12) comprises a tubular

container (13) closed at one end (14) and open at its opposite
end, said tubular container (13) being rotatable between a first

vertical position into which the cone falls by gravity in an
inverted position from said cone dispenser (10), and a second

oblique position in which the cone (18), overturned from its
former position, is discharged by gravity into a chute (19) which

feeds the cone (18) in an upright position into said seat (20).
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said seat (20) can be shifted in sequence into three operating

positions, namely a lower first position for receiving the cone
(18), an upper second position for filling the cone (18) with the

ice-cream portion, and an intermediate third position in which the
cone containing ice-cream is removed by the customer.
A machine as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
when in said upper and intermediate positions the cone (18) is

protected by an automatically openable and closable protection
door (28).
