<ABSTRACT>
The internal equipment (4) includes a metal ring (13) whose external diameter is substantially equal to the internal diameter of the tubular workpieces (1, 2) which include a plurality of slots of radial direction over part of its width, defining adjacent ring segments connected together, and a device (14) for holding and pressing the metal ring (13) against the inner surfaces of the annular workpieces (1, 2) in their junction area (11), including a central support part (21) and a plurality of arms (22) of adjustable length, in an arrangement radiating around the central part (21). The internal equipment (4) also includes two walls (15, 16) delimiting a sealed chamber (8) inside the workpieces (1, 2).
