<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vitamin D3 
based lactone, derivative which is useful as a 
pharmaceutical. More specifically, it relates to 
1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 based lactone derivatives 
useful as an accelerator of bone formation (i.e., an 
osteogenetic accelerator), a suppressant of tumor cell 
proliferation, a drug for treating hypercalcemia, or 
other pharmaceuticals, a process for production of the 
same, and an intermediate for the production thereof. The fact that the metabolites of vitamin D3 
perform an extremely important function as substances 
controlling the metabolism of calcium and phosphates in 
the living body is now becoming widely recognized through 
numerous disclosures in patents and general references. 
Recently, further, an increase is being seen in clinical 
applications as drugs for treatment of various ailments, 
such as with the discovery of numerous substances having 
the ability to induce differentiation of tumorous bone 
marrow cells. Further, recently, a novel vitamin D3 
active metabolite having an α-hydroxylactone ring at a 
steroid side chain has been discovered (Arch. Biochem. 
Biophys., 204, 339-391 (1980); FEBS LETTERS, 134, 207-211 
(1981)). This compound is 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3-26, 
23-lactone and is represented by the structure shown 
below:  
 
This compound is reported to have actions such 
as an action of lowering the concentration of calcium in 
blood serum (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(Kokai) No. 58-118516-Japanese Patent No.1493319), an action of suppressing the 
proliferation of tumorous cells (Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 58-210011-Japanese Pantent No.1595226), an action of 
accelerating bone formation (Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 60-185715-Japanese Patent No.1598723), etc. and is expected 
to contribute much as a drug for treatment of various 
ailments. Accordingly, the objects of the present invention 
are to provide a novel lactone compound, and a production 
process thereof, which is expected to be useful as 
pharmaceuticals, for example, an accelerator of bone 
formation, a suppressant of tumor cell proliferation, and 
a drug for treating hypercalcemia. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will be apparent from the following 
description. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a lactone compound having the formula (I):  
 
 
wherein n is zero or 1 and m is zero or 1, provided that 
both n and m are not zero at the same time, or a 
stereoi
