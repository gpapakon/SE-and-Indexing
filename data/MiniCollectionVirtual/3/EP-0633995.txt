<ABSTRACT>
A hot water cylinder (10) having upper and lower horizontally extending immersion heaters (13, 12) is provided with a pair of spaced parallel upright baffle plates (14) positioned one on each side of the lower heating element (12) to cause a column of heated water to rise centrally within the cylinder (10) and to circulate downwardly outside the baffles thus to create substantially complete circulation by convection of heated water within at least the lower part of the cylinder to ensure a substantially uniform water temperature therein. In an alternative arrangement of a helical upright heating coil (23) the baffle plate is formed as a cylindrical sleeve (24) within the coil such that heated water rises outside the sleeve (24) and circulates downwardly inside the latter. The provision of the baffle avoids the creation of pockets of cooler water in the base of the cylinder (10) in which bacteria may breed.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION concerns a storage water heater and
preferably, though not exclusively, a hot water cylinder for containing
a mass of water, and having an input for unheated water, and outlet
for heated water, and at least one internal heat source such as an
immersion heater or indirect heating coil.A typical domestic hot water cylinder includes a
horizontal immersion element which passes across the internal space
near the bottom of the cylinder and produces substantially uniform
temperature in the water above the element. This is by natural
convection. The zone below the level of the element however
becomes stratified and is heated only by conduction through the water
or, minimally, by conduction through the copper wall. Also, since the
cold water input is usually close to the bottom of the cylinder and
beneath the heating element, this lower region of the cylinder usually
contains water at a temperature of no greater than 30 to 35°C, a
temperature which provides an ideal condition for the development of,
for example, legionella bacteria.For indirectly heated cylinders, a heating coil supplied
with hot water from a boiler may replace the immersion element, but
the temperature at the bottom of the cylinder will again be in the
region of 20 to 40°C.An object of the present invention is to provide a 
storage water heater of the kind described but wherein substantially
uniform heating of the water throughout the vessel is ensured such
that when the heat source is active the temperature of the water
throughout the vessel is above the ideal temperature for breeding of
bacteria.Patent specification AT-B-391202 describes a through-flow
water heater comprising a container having an inlet for cold water
and an outlet for heated water, an electric heating element within
the container and a baffle surrounding the heating element and spaced
inwardly from the wall of the container and dividing the interior of
the container into inner and outer chambers which are in open
communication with each other at both ends of the baffle and
wherein the cold water inlet is arranged at one end of the container
to feed a jet of cold water into the inner chamber in such a way as
to draw water from the outer chamber into the inner chamber to be
heated.The present invention is distinguished from that described
in AT-B-391202 in that the latter is a through flow heater which
water is heated as it flows through the container whereas the present
application is concerned with a storage water heater adapted to
contain a mass of water to

<CLAIMS>
A storage water heater comprising an enclosed vessel (10)
for containing a mass of water, the vessel (10) having a lower cold

water inlet (A) formed in a wall thereof and an upper hot water
outlet (B) formed in a wall thereof; internal heating means (12, 23)

located in a lower region of the vessel (10) and close to the base
thereof and operative, primarily during night periods when there is no

demand for hot water, to heat substantially the whole of said mass of
water to an elevated temperature ready for consumption, the

arrangement being such that, in use, the mass of stored hot water is
permanently subjected to cold water pressure via the lower inlet (A)

whereby, upon a demand for hot water, cold water enters the vessel
(10) through the lower inlet (A) thus displacing the whole mass of

stored hot water upwardly and simultaneously discharging a
corresponding amount of stored hot water from the upper region of

the vessel (10) directly through the upper outlet (B); and water-circulating
means comprising upright baffle means (14, 24) located

adjacent to the heating means (12, 23) and extending downwardly at
least to the lower extremity of the heating means (12, 23), with the

lowermost extremity of the baffle means (14, 24) close
to the bottom of the vessel (10), said baffle means (14, 24) being

adapted, when the heating means (12, 23) is operative, to promote, by
convection, circulation of water throughout the lower r
egion of the
vessel (10) thereby ensuring that substantially the whole mass in the

vessel will be heated to an elevated temperature, and inhibiting the
establishment of stagnant regions of relatively cool water in said

lower region of the vessel. 
A storage water heater according to Claim 1, wherein
the heating means (12) extends generally horizontally across the vessel (10)

and said baffle means comprises a pair of upright plates (14) arranged
in spaced parallel relationship on each side of the heating means (12)

above and below the latter.
A storage water heater according to Claim 2, wherein
the baffle plates (14) are attached along their respective upright

edges to the internal wall surfaces of the vessel.
A storage water heater according to Claim 3, wherein
the vessel (10) is cylindrical and the baffle plates (14) extend generally

diametrically across the vessel (10), the lower extremities of the baffle
plates (14) resting upon a domed central region of the base of the

vessel (10).
A storage water heater according to Claim 4, including a
pair of vertically spaced heating elements (12, 13) each extending generally

diametrically across the vessel (10), one (12) close to the bottom and the
other (13) close to the top of the vessel (10) and the baffle plates (14)

extend upwardly from a level beneath the bottom element (12) to an
uppermost level beneath the upper element (13) and are spaced apart,

on each side of the vertical line between the heating elements (12,
13) such that, in use, a column of heated water is caused to rise

between the baffle plates (14) to circulate downwardly outside of the
latter thus to create a continuous circulation of heated water 

vertically around the baffle plates (14).
A storage water heater according to any one of Claims 2
to 5, wherein the flow area created beneath each baffle plate (14) is

no greater than one half of the flow area between the baffle plates
(14).
A storage water heater according to Claim 4, wherein
the baffle plates (14) are placed at or in the region of 75mm apart

and extend upwardly to a level which may be between 50mm above
the top of the lower heating element (12) and 40mm below the

bottom of the upper heating element (13).
A storage water heater according to any one of Claims 2
to 7 in which the baffle plates (14) form two walls of a box-like duct

open at the top and bottom and into which the heating means (12)
extends with a sealed connection thereto.
A storage water heater according to Claim 1, wherein
the heating means comprises an indirect heating coil (23) located with

its centric axis upright in the vessel (10) and the baffle means
comprises an open-ended upright cylinder (24) fixed and located within

the diametrical bounds of the heating coil (23) such that in use a
cylindrical column of heated water will circulate upwardly outside the

baffle and downwardly inside the latter.
A storage water heater according to Claim 9, wherein
the upright cylindrical baffle (24) extends to positions above and 

below the top and bottom respectively of the heating coil (23).
A storage water heater according to Claim 1, wherein
the heating means comprises an indirect heating coil located with its

centric axis upright in the vessel, and the baffle means comprises an
open-ended upright cylinder positioned to surround the heating coil

such that in use a column of heated water will circulate upwardly
within the cylinder and downwardly outside the latter.
