Binding for snowboards having a binding member
attachable to the sliding board with two gripping

jaws (13), which form lateral support surfaces for a
boot (1) provided with at least one projection (5),

as well as having a slit-shaped aperture (15)
provided on at least one gripping jaw (13) which

aperture is open on an inner side as well as on an
upper side of the gripping jaw (13) for the

introduction of the projection (5) oriented with its
longitudinal extension perpendicular or transverse to

the longitudinal extension of the slit-shaped
aperture (15), characterised in that at the aperture

(15) the gripping jaw (13) possesses a locking member
(16, 16a) which is movable between a locking

position, in which it reaches into the aperture (15)
by a locking section (21, 21a), and a non-locking

position, in which the locking section (21, 21a) is
located outside the aperture, and which in the

locking position engages by the locking section (21,
21a) behind the projection (5) introduced into the

aperture (15) to fix the latter in this aperture.
Binding according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the gripping jaws (13) form support surfaces (14) for

the heel region (4) of the boot.
Binding according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that both gripping jaws (13) each possess an aperture

(15) and a locking member (16, 16a).
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the gripping jaws (13) are

constructed in the manner of a housing for the 
accommodation of the member of the locking member

(16a).
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the locking member (16, 16a) is

movable by swivelling between the locking position
and the non-locking position.
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the locking member (16a) is

constructed as a sprung catch member in such a way
that on introducing the projection (5) into the

aperture (15) it is moved against the action of a
spring (35) from the locking position into the non-locking

position and after the introduction of the
projection into the aperture returns to the locking

position and by this means locks the projection (5)
in the aperture (15).
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the locking member (16, 16a) is

of hook-like construction or is provided with a hook-like
locking section (21, 21a).
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised by means (20, 27) for the manual

opening of the binding (6, 6a).
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the binding possesses at least

one securing member, preferably a securing lever
(22), blocking or securing the locking member (16) in

the locking position and/or a retaining member,
preferably a pawl-type lever (28), holding the

locking member (16) in the non-locking position. 
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that by a surface, preferably by a

bottom surface, the at least single aperture (15)
forms a further support surface for the boot.
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the binding member (9, 9a, 9b)

possesses a preferably wedge-shaped surface (12)
which when the boot (1) is arranged in the binding is

arranged under the heel or heel-step (4) of the boot
(19) and is at least in part at a distance from the

latter.
Binding according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised by a further binding member (8)

attachable to the snowboard having a retaining member
(11) for engaging behind a surface or step (3) at the

front end of the boot (1).
