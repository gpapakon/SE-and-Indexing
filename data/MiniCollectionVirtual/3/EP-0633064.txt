<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
photocatalyst composite comprising a substrate having
photocatalyst particles adhered thereon and a process
for producing the same.Exposure of photocatalyst particles to an
irradiation of a wavelength corresponding to not less
than the band gap energy causes the photoexcitation of
electrons into a conduction band with a corresponding
generation of holes in a valence band. The strong
reduction power of the electrons and the strong oxidation
power of the holes generated by this optical
excitation have been utilized in decomposition and
purification of organic materials as well as in decomposition
of water. The photocatalyst particles to be
used in such treatments are usually deposited on a
substrate of dimensions larger than the photocatalyst
particles in order to prevent them from scattering into
the air or exhausting out of the system and subsequently
to provide for easy separation of the photocatalyst from
the treatment system. The deposition of photocatalyst
particles on a substrate has been accomplished by a 
method comprising sintering the photocatalyst particles
on the substrate at a temperature of 400°C or higher to
adhere the particles to the substrate, or a method
comprising spraying a precursor, which can be converted
to photocatalyst through thermal decomposition, onto a
substrate heated at a temperature of about 400°C,
thereby adhering the particles on the substrate.
Alternatively, there has been proposed a method
immobilizing photocatalyst particles using a certain
type of fluorinated polymer. For example, Japanese
patent KOKAI (Laid-open) No. Hei 4-284851 discloses a
method comprising laminating a mixture of photocatalyst
particles and a fluorinated polymer and compressing the
laminate under a pressure. Japanese Patent KOKAI
(Laid-open) No. Hei 4-334552 discloses a method
comprising thermally fusing a fluorinated polymer to
adhere photocatalyst particles thereto.JP-A-5-146671 discloses a process for optically immobilizing
carbon dioxide, characterized by producing an oxygen-containing
hydrocarbon, by bringing carbon dioxide and water under
irradiation of a ray into contact with a photocatalyst
composite comprising light-transmitting porous inorganic
particles having an oxide semiconductor carried thereon
thermally fused with a light-transmitting fluororesin onto a
light-emitting porous substrate. Recently, an attempt has been made to use
photocatalyst particles for decomposition of deleterious
materials, malodorous materials and oily substances in
the
