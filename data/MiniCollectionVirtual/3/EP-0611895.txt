<ABSTRACT>
An illustration and description are given of shaft coupling systems each with at least one tandem membrane coupling comprising in each case two membranes. The membranes are arranged and connected to the associated coupling parts in such a skilful way that the overall axial length of the coupling is small. The description also shows how it is possible in simple manner to construct coupling systems that can be assembled and disassembled radially using at least one double membrane coupling.

Shaft coupling for compensating radial, axial and angular 
displacements of the connected shafts (31, 32), having at 

least one flexible compensating element in the form of a 
tandem diaphragm, which is so formed by two serially 

connected disk-shaped or annular diaphragms (19, 20) 
detachably connected to one another at their outer 

peripheral regions that the diaphragms (19, 20), which 
are disposed in an axial direction of the coupling (10) 

substantially parallel to one another, are firmly 
connected to one another at an outer peripheral region 

and are connected by their respective inner peripheral 
region to one of the two machine elements which are to be 

displaceable relative to one another, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one of the two diaphragms (19; 20) of a 
tandem diaphragm (19, 20) is connected by means of an 

axially braceable clamping bush arrangement to the 
associated coupling part (16; 31; 32) such as a hub, 

flange or the like, and that the clamping bushes (27) 
each comprise a sleeve portion (28) with a flat stop 

collar (29) formed on the end thereof and are axially 
inserted into bores in the diaphragm (19; 20) in such a 

way that their stop collars (29) rest against the side 
directed towards the other diaphragm (20; 19). 
Shaft coupling according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each clamping bush (27) has an internal thread for 

adjustably receiving a clamping screw (25) and its 
lateral surface together with a clamping sleeve receiver, 

against which the head of the clamping screw (25) is 
supported at least indirectly in a pressure-locked 

manner, forms a tight fit. 
Shaft coupling according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the clamping sleeve receivers are formed directly in  

 
the associated coupling part itself, e.g. in a hub flange 

(31a; 33a; 33b; 32a). 
Shaft coupling according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the clamping sleeve receivers are formed in an 

annular disk (26) serving as a spreader between the 
diaphragm (19) and the coupling part (16) and braceable 

by means of the clamping screws (25) on the coupling 
part (16). 
Shaft coupling according to claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterized in that the radially 

inner clamping screws of the two individual diaphragms 
(19; 20) of a tandem diaphragm (19, 20) are disposed on 

graduated circles which differ in such a way that parts 
of the diaphragm fastening means situated on diaphragm 

sides of the same tandem diaphragm which are directed 
towards one another have no overlap in a radial 

direction. 
Shaft coupling according to claim 5 in the form of a 
cardan shaft with an, in particular, tubular connecting 

piece (33) between two coupling arrangements (14 or 14'), 
characterized in that the diaphragms (29) connected to 

the connecting piece (33) have the connecting regions 
which are disposed radially further in than the 

respective other two diaphragms (19). 
Shaft coupling according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the two individual diaphragms (19; 

20) of a tandem diaphragm (19, 20) [have] substantially 

identical radial dimensions and the associated clamping 
screws (25) accordingly lie on substantially identical 

graduated circles, the latter however being arranged 
offset in a peripheral direction relative to one another 

in such a way that parts of the diaphragm fastening means 
situated at diaphragm sides of the same tandem diaphragm  

 
which are directed towards one another have no overlap in 

a peripheral direction. 
Shaft coupling according to claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, in particular according to claim 6 or 

7, characterized in that at least some of the clamping 
screws (25), in particular the clamping screws acting 

upon the connecting piece (33), have a lengthened screw 
shank which comes to axially overlap a radially outer-lying 

overlap portion (e.g. flange 31a).of the coupling 

part (e.g. 31) connected to the other diaphragm. 
Shaft coupling according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the coupling part connected to the other diaphragm 

is provided with recesses or bores (34; 35) for the free 
engagement of the lengthened screw shanks. 
Shaft coupling according to claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterized in that the two 

diaphragms (19; 20) each comprise a thin, flat, metal - 
in particular, steel - annular disk. 
Coupling system using a coupling according to claim 1 or 
one of the subsequent claims, which is both suitable for 

compensating radial, axial and angular displacements of 
the connected shafts and at the same time is torsionally 

highly flexible, characterized in that one diaphragm (19) 
of the tandem diaphragm coupling (19, 20) is fastened to 

the flange (16) of a known rubber ring coupling (13) 
serially connected thereto. 
Coupling system using coupling according to claim 1 or 
one of the subsequent claims, which is both suitable for 

compensating radial, axial and angular displacements of 
the connected shafts and at the same time is torsionally 

highly flexible, characterized in that one diaphragm (19) 
of a first tandem diaphragm coupling (19, 20) is fastened  

 
to the flange (16) of a known rubber ring coupling (13) 

serially connected thereto and connected to the drive 
unit, that a second diaphragm (19) of a second tandem 

diaphragm arrangement (19, 20) is connected to the shaft 
of the output-end machine unit and the two middle 

diaphragms (20) of the two tandem diaphragm couplings 
(19, 20) are connected to a connecting piece (33), which 

couples the latter in a torsionally rigid manner to one 
another.
