<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a torque control system for internal 
combustion engines which can save electric power consumption 

by appropriately avoiding torque application after the internal 
combustion engine starts increasing the torque. Ignition timing 

detecting means (7, 13, 208, 209) detects the ignition timing 
of an internal combustion engine (1). Torque application start 

commanding means (13, 207, 307) commands operation start to 
torque applying means (3, 5, 8), generator-motor (3), under the 

torque increase command from the internal combustion engine 
(1), while torque application stop commanding means (13, 210, 

310) commands operation stop to the torque applying means (3, 
5, 8) according to the number of ignitions immediately before 

the engine torque actually starts increasing under the torque 
increase command. The torque applying means (3, 5, 8) continuously 

applies torque to the internal combustion engine (1) 
after the input of the operation command until the input of the 

operation stop command. As a result, effective torque 
application and electric power saving can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a torque 
control system for internal combustion engines, and more 
particularly to a torque control system for internal combustion 
engines which enables engine torque control with a high responsiveness 
to, for instance, vehicle acceleration. Japanese unexamined patent application laid-open No. 
1-130030 discloses a torque control system which enables an 
internal combustion engine mounted on a vehicle to have a high 
responsiveness to acceleration at an early stage thereof. 
Specifically, torque is applied to such an extent that the rpm 
(rotational speed) of the internal combustion engine is increased 
by the preset rpm from the instantaneous rpm of the 
internal combustion engine at the time when the acceleration 
command is detected. In addition, Japanese unexamined patent application 
laid-open No. 59-185872 and FR-A-2 563 280 disclose a torque control system in 
which when the rpm of an internal combustion engine falls below 
the instantaneous rpm of the internal combustion engine in 
idling operation, generator operation of a generator-motor 
connected to an internal combustion engine stops and the motor 
operation starts to prevent any rpm drop. However, in each of the above conventional torque 
application methods, as the torque application is stopped only 
after actual rpm rise is detected, there is a drawback that  
 
electric power consumption is wasted and energy is lost by 
continuously applying torque to the internal combustion engine 
even after the torque of the internal combustion engine has 
begun to increase. In view of the above drawback, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a torque control system according to claim 1 for 
internal combustion engines which can save electric power 
consumption by most appropriately stopping torque application 
by motor operation of a generator-motor after the torque of the 
internal combustion engine has begun to increase. A torque control system for internal combustion engines 
according to the present invention is characterized by torque 
applying means torque applicably connected to an internal 
combustion engine, ignition number detecting means for 
detecting number of ignitions of the internal combustion 
engine, torque application start commanding means for commanding 
motor operation start to the torque applying means under 
the torque increase command from the internal combustion 
engine, and torque application stop commanding means for 
commanding motor operation stop to the
