<ABSTRACT>
A film cartridge accomodating mechanism comprises
 

   a cartridge chamber (6) for accommodating a film 
cartridge (P) containing a roll of film wound around a 

shaft (Px) of said film cartridge, said cartridge chamber 
(6) having a slitlike film outlet opening (6c) disposed at 

a side wall (6A) thereof for allowing passage of said film,
 

   a rotatable arrangement (18) connectable to the shaft 
(Px) of said film cartridge (P) and rotatable in both 

directions so as to forward the film toward the film 
outlet opening (6c) upon rotating one direction and take 

up the film around the shaft (Px) upon rotating another 
direction, and

 
   a positioning member (12) which is provided in 

opposite position concerning the rotatable arrangement 
(18) within said cartridge chamber (6) so as to regulate a 

radial positioning of the film cartridge (P).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film cartridge
accommodating mechanism and more specifically to a film
cartridge accommodating mechanism according to the precharacterizing
part of claim 1.A camera having a film cartridge accommodating
mechanism of the type mentioned hereinabove and provided
for the accommodation of a conventional film cartridge is
known from DE-A-33 34 351. The film cartridge accommodating
mechanism disclosed therein shows on a lateral lid of the
camera an annular ring which might be provided for engaging
a shaft of the film cartridge when inserted into a
cartridge chamber. US-A-4 445 768 discloses a photographic film
assemblage with a film cartridge in which, prior to its
insertion into a photographic camera, a film can be fed out
of the cartridge manually by a user when holding a housing
of the cartridge in one hand and rotating a film spool of
the cartridge with the other hand.In a film cartridge accommodating mechanism of a
conventional photographic camera, for loading a film,
firstly, a back lid of the camera is opened and then a film
cartridge is accommodated in a cartridge chamber.Thereafter, a user of the camera holds the leading film end
projecting from the film cartridge and then manually
positions the same to a passage extending from the film
outlet opening of the cartridge chamber to a film exposure
section. After this, by manually operating a winding-up
lever or by operating an automatic film winding-up device
by closing the back lid of the camera or by other methods,
the film is loaded. However, such film loading operation is
troublesome.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
film cartridge accommodating mechanism of the type
initially described, so as to facilitate the loading
operation of the film accommodated in the film cartridge. According to the present invention, this object is
attained by providing a film cartridge accommodating
mechanism as specified in claim 1.Further improvements of the film cartridge
accommodating mechanism according to the present invention
are specified in the sub-claims being dependent on claim 1.The film cartridge accommodating mechanism according
to the present invention has the advantage of easily
enabling film feeding after insertion of a film cartridge
into the film cartridge accommodating mechanism by manual
or automatic operation of film feeding means. Said film
feeding means or at least a part thereof also may be used
in a reverse direction for performing a film rewind
operation. It also is possible to form compact

<CLAIMS>
A film cartridge accommodating mechanism comprising

a cartridge chamber (6) for accommodating a film
cartridge (P) containing a roll of film wound around a

shaft (Px) of said film cartridge, said cartridge chamber
(6) having a slitlike film outlet opening (6c) disposed at

a side wall (6A) thereof for allowing passage of said film;
a rotatable arrangement (18) connectable to one end of
the shaft (Px) of said film cartridge (P); and
a guide member (12) provided opposite the rotatable
arrangement (18), within said cartridge chamber (6);
characterized in that
said rotatable arrangement (18) is arranged to rotate
the shaft (Px) of said film cartridge in both directions so

as to forward the film toward the film outlet opening (6c)
upon rotating in one direction, and take up the film around

the shaft (Px) upon rotating in the other direction; and
said guide member (12) is arranged for entering into
the other end of the shaft (Px) of said film cartridge so

as to regulate the radial positioning of the film cartridge
by fitting the inside periphery of said shaft, thereby

setting the radial positioning of the film cartridge (P).
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in claim 1, characterized in that said guide member (12) is

of conical shape.
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said

guide member (12) is rotatably mounted.
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said

cartridge chamber (6) has a shape allowing rotation of the
film cartridge (P) within said cartridge chamber.
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in claim 4, characterized by a mechanism preventing

rotation of the film cartridge (P) in a predetermined
direction.
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in claim 5, characterized in that said rotation preventing

mechanism comprises a rotation preventing plate (13)
connected to the rotatably mounted guide member (12), said

rotation preventing plate (13) having an annular elastic
frictional member (14; 14') provided to come into contact

with a lower end face (Pb) of said film cartridge (P) when
acccommodated in the chartridge chamber (6), and sawtoothed

projections (13a) engageable by spring elements (15)
located at the path of rotational movement of said rotation

preventing plate (13).
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in any of the preceding claims, characterized by a lid (8)

for closing and opening said cartridge chamber (6), wherein
said guide member (12) is provided on said lid (8). 
The film cartridge accommodating mechanism as defined
in claim 7, characterized in that said guide member (12) is

rotatably carried by a shaft (8a) of said lid (8).
