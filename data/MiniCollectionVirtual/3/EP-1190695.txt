<ABSTRACT>
A dental catalyst for chemical polymerization comprising an acidic
compound, an organic peroxide such as cumene hydroperoxide, and aryl borate

compound such as sodium tetraphenylborate, but without substantially containing
amine compound. This catalyst is chemically highly stable, is easy to handle, is

highly active, is less likely to be impaired by polymerization, and does not cause the
cured product to be tinted or discolored, and is very useful for the dental restorative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dental catalyst
for chemical polymerization used in the field of dental
therapy, to a dental adhesive composition using the dental
catalyst for chemical polymerization, and to use of the
dental curable composition.A method of curing a polymerizable monomer by using a
catalyst for polymerization has been widely employed in
the dental field by using, for example, a dental cement, a
dental adhesive, a composite resin, a dental self-curing
resin, a dental pretreatment material, etc.These materials require catalysts for polymerization
of different kinds depending upon their compositions,
objects of use and required properties. The catalysts for
polymerization may be divided into those for photo
polymerization and those for chemical polymerization. It,
however, becomes necessary to use a catalyst for chemical
polymerization when the curable composition contains much
filler which permits light to pass through little or when
the catalyst is used for such applications where it cannot
be irradiated with light. Further, the dental adhesive
and the pretreatment material, in many cases, require the
use of a catalyst for chemical polymerization depending
upon the kind of the dental material that is to be
adhered. Besides, the catalyst for photo polymerization
must be irradiated with light by using a dedicated device.
From the standpoint of easy operation, therefore, it is
often desired to use the catalyst for chemical
polymerization.In restoring a tooth damaged by, for example, 
decaying or accident by directly filling the cavity of the
tooth with a paste-like dental restorative as represented
by a composite resin or a composite polymer followed by
curing (direct restoring method), there has been used, as
an adhesive (adhesive for directly restoring the teeth), a
bonding agent comprising chiefly a polymerizable monomer
which contains an acidic group-containing polymerizable
monomer. As the bonding agent, there has been developed
an excellent material which does not require the
pretreatment that was so far needed (Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publications (Kokai) Nos. 263604/1997 and
245525/1998). The above bonding agent, however, uses a
particular catalyst for photo polymerization, and it has
been desired to omit the operation for irradiation with
light in order to simplify the adhering operation.
Besides, when the above bonding agent is used in
combination with a dental restorative of the chemical
polymerization type, the unreacted acidic group-containing
polymerizable monomer in the
