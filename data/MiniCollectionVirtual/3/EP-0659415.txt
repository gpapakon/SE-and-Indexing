<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting vasomotor symptoms and 
attending psychological disturbances surrounding post-menopausal 

syndrome comprising administering to a female 
human in need of treatment an effective amount of a 

compound having the formula 

   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
It has been noted throughout human history that 
women, upon reaching the age of memopause, have suffered 
from a variety of symptoms associated with the decline in 
ovarian function. Although the etiology of these symptoms 
is not clearly understood, it appears to be linked with the 
decline and imbalance of natural hormones, particularly the 
sex related hormones and more particularly to the decrease 
in the production of estrogens. Many symptoms have been 
linked to what is generally called, "the post-menopausal 
syndrome". These symptoms are often highly idiosyncratic 
and of varying severity and length of duration both between 
different patients as well as within the same patient. 
Many of the symptoms are serious and sometimes life-threatening 
pathologies, e.g., osteoporosis, 
hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes. Some symptoms are 
less serious, but cause a great deal of pain and/or 
suffering, e.g., hot flashes, palpitations, atrophic 
vaginitis, joint pain, and muscular weakness. Yet other 
symptoms are of a psychological nature, e.g., headache, 
dizziness, lack of concentration, sleeplessness, apathy, 
lassitude, depression, and a sense of uselessness. The 
psychological symptoms are probably the most idiosyncratic 
of all in the post-menopausal syndrome and the least 
understood. Many have argued that there is no post-menopausal 
syndrome as a true psychiatric syndrome, but it 
is undeniable that these are common in post-menopausal 
women and make their appearance at the onset of menopause. 
It is not clear whether these psychological symptoms are 
the direct effect of estrogen deprivation in the central or 
peripheral nervous system or if the symptoms are the result 
of the vasomotor effects of estrogen deprivation, e.g., hot  
 
flashes which disturb sleep may cause the tiredness and the 
apathy so often seen. The subject of this invention deals with the 
treatment of the vasomotor and psychological symptoms 
associated with menopause. The major and most common 
vasomotor symptom is hot flashes and/or flushes and the 
resulting sweats. Hot flashes are embarrassing, 
uncomfortable, and disturb the ability to sleep. A 
somewhat less common symptom is the palpitation of the 
heart rhythm, which although usually not pathological, can 
be very frightening and a cause of discomfort. The least 
common vasomotor symptoms are those of joint pain and 
muscular weakness. Additionally, the treatment of the 
associated psychological symptoms are the subject of this 
invention, although it not clear if
