effective and efficient way, which comprises: a flexible 

tape (4) carrying abrasive grains (4c) in the working face thereof; 
an infeed reel (5) for feeding the tape (4) stored thereon: a take-up 

reel (6) for taking up the tape (4) fed from the infeed reel (5); a 
motor (13) for driving to rotate the take-up reel (6); a means for 

blowing a fluid (11) to the backside surface to the edge portion

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for polishing a 
wafer and more particularly relates to an apparatus for 
polishing the notch of a wafer. As is known, an optical lithography technique is used 
to form patterns, for example, a buried layer pattern to 
fabricate semiconductor integrated circuit in the surface of 
a silicon single crystal wafer or a compound semiconductor 
wafer ( hereinafter referred to as wafer ) as a substrate. On application of the optical lithography, required are 
positioning and orientating of a wafer with a high degree of 
precision. Therefore, it is well known that a portion of the 
periphery of a wafer is cut away to form a flat profile and 
the portion is then used as a reference in positioning and  
 
orientating. The portion thus cut away in a straight line is 
called an orientation flat. The surface portion lost in forming an orientation flat 
along the periphery of a wafer is not be negligible small 
since it is to form a flat profile that the periphery 
portion of the wafer is cut away. In other words, the total 
number of semiconductor chips to be yielded from one wafer 
decreases by the number corresponding to the lost surface 
and thereby there comes a problem that the effective usage 
of an expensive wafer is disturbed. Waht's more, when a wafer with a larger diameter has an 
orientation flat along the periphery and the wafer is dried 
in an apparatus such as a spin dryer in which wafers are 
dried by a centrifugal force according to a high 
revolutionary speed. there comes another problem that the 
wafers have difficulty being balanced about the axis of 
rotation of the apparatus. In light of the problems above mentioned, a contrivance 
was recently put in practical use that a portion of the 
periphery of a wafer is cut away to form a minor circular 
arc terminating at two points on the periphery or a V letter  
 
with the apex pointing to the center of the wafer, that is, 
a so-called notch and positioning and orientating of the 
wafer are conducted by means of the notch in the process of 
semiconductor chips fabrication. A wafer having a notch is shown in a plan view in 
Fig.4. In the figure, the numeral reference 1 indicates a 
notch, which is constructed in the shape of a V letter cut 
and what's more, the edge is profiled as shown in vertical 
section in Fig.5 so as to be convexed toward the opening of 
the notch. On the other hand, fine dusts are a disturbance in the 
optical lithography step of a microelectronic fabrication 
and therefore, clean rooms

wafer, comprising: 


a flexible tape (4) carrying abrasive grains on 
the working surface thereof; 
an infeed reel (5) for feeding the tape (4) stored 
thereon; 
a take-up reel (6) for taking up the tape (4) fed 
from the infeed reel (5); 
a motor (13) for driving to rotate the take-up 
reel (6); 
a means (11) for pressing the working surface of 
the tape (4) to an edge portion of the notch (1) to be

longitudinal axis of the tape during polishing 

operation of the apparatus; and in that the apparatus 
further comprises: 


four guide rollers (7,8,9,10), a first pair of 
which (7,10) are located respectively in the vicinity 

of the infeed reel (5) and the take-up reel (6), and a 
second pair of which (8,9) are positioned near the
