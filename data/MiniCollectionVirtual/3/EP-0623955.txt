<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor chip module is formed by providing 
at least one semiconductor chip (20) and a semiconductor 

substrate (30) and bonding the semiconductor chip (20) to the 
semiconductor substrate (30) without the use of an epoxy or a 

metallic layer to create a bond between the semiconductor 
chip (20) and the semiconductor substrate (30). The semiconductor 

chip (20) of the semiconductor chip module is electrically 
connected to an external, electrical interconnection 

system. The semiconductor substrate (30) has similar thermal 
properties to the semiconductor chip (20), this thermal 

mismatch present between a semiconductor chip (20) and a 
metallic heatsink in conventional external, electrical 

interconnection systems is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor chips, and more particularly, but not 
limited to, a semiconductor chip module used in a 
semiconductor package. Semiconductor chips or integrated circuits are 
typically bonded to an external, electrical 
interconnection system (hereinafter interconnection 
system). The interconnection system enables one to 
electrically connect the semiconductor chip to an 
external system. This interconnection typically includes 
a metal leads or a leadframe having an integral or a 
separate metal heatsink. The semiconductor chip is 
electrically connected to the leads. The chip and a 
portion of the interconnection system are typically 
encapsulated or housed in a metal or ceramic housing. 
The interconnection system, as used herein, also 
describes chips bonded to a printed circuit board. In this conventional process, a silicon chip or 
die with or without metal deposited on the back side is 
attached to the metal leadframe or a metal heatsink 
through a die attach or adhesive media. The die attach 
or adhesive media is comprised of solder or other 
metallic materials, or an epoxy based material. In this 
conventional interconnection system, a thermal mismatch 
occurs between the semiconductor material of the 
semiconductor chip and the die attach material, and the 
die attach material and the metallic leadframe. Problems 
with these interconnection systems include die cracking 
due to thermal mismatch, failure of the bond between the  
 
die and the die attach material, and voiding in 
conventional solder and epoxy die attach systems. Thus, it would be desirable to provide an 
interconnection system without the problems associated 
with the conventional systems. A semiconductor chip module is formed by providing 
at least one semiconductor chip and a semiconductor 
substrate and bonding the semiconductor chip to the 
semiconductor substrate without the use of an epoxy or a 
metallic layer to create a bond between the semiconductor 
chip and the semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor chip may be electrically 
connected to an external, electrical interconnection 
system. FIG. 1 illustrates a top view of an embodiment of
