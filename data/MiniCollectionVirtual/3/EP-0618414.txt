<ABSTRACT>
A cooling apparatus comprises a cooling chamber (2), means (4) for 
introducing liquefied gas or its cold vapour thereinto, an exhaust 

passage (16) having flow inducing means associated therewith and a heat 
transfer means (46) associated with said exhaust passage (16) in which 

the heat transfer means operates to transfer heat from a heat source to 
the exhaust gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cooling apparatus, particularly of the kind in which a liquefied gas or
its cold vapour is introduced into a chamber to perform a cooling duty and cold spent gas is
exhausted from the chamber.Such cooling apparatus is widely used in industry, for example in the freezing of food. A
liquefied gas, typically liquid nitrogen, may be used to cool food in a tumbler or screw
conveyor, or may be used to freeze food in a tunnel or a so-called immersion freezer.US-A-4403479, for example, discloses a food freezing apparatus having all the features of the preamble of claim 1. In this apparatus, food products are
first immersed in liquid nitrogen and then conveyed through a separate chamber and further
cooled by vapour from the liquid bath drawn into the chamber.In the example of a freezing tunnel, food is advanced on a conveyor through a chamber in
the form of a tunnel into which liquid nitrogen is injected. Typically, the liquid nitrogen is
directed at the food and extracts heat therefrom as it vaporises. A fan or fans are employed
to provide a flow of cold nitrogen vapour through the tunnel in a direction opposite to that in
which the food is advanced through the tunnel. This flow of cold nitrogen vapour is also
able to extract heat from the food. In order to limit the amount of cold nitrogen vapour that
spills out of the ends of the tunnel, a fan is employed to extract the cold nitrogen vapour
from a position in the tunnel between its ends. The fan typically communicates with an
outlet in the roof of the tunnel. Since liquid nitrogen vaporises at a temperature of -196Â°C,
the temperature of the vapour extracted from the tunnel is well below freezing point even
though there has been heat exchange between the vapour and the food (or other articles or
material being advanced through the tunnel) and dilution of the nitrogen vapour with air
takes place in the tunnel.The operation of the exhaust fan induces a flow of air into the tunnel. Measures need to be
taken to prevent the cold exhaust gas from causing ice to be deposited on the fan.
Otherwise, there is a risk that either damage is caused to the fan, in operation, by the ice or
that there will be a sufficient accumulation of ice to prevent its operation.The solution normally adopted to this problem is to provide the ducting by which the fan is
placed in communication with the outlet from the tunnel with an adjustable inlet for ambient
air. Typically, this inlet is designed so as to enable the fan to draw in a flow of ambient air 
into the

<CLAIMS>
Cooling apparatus comprising, a cooling chamber (2); means (4) for injecting
liquefied gas or its cold vapour into the chamber (2); an exhaust gas passage

(16), communicating with an outlet (12) from the chamber (2), for removing
exhaust gas comprising vapour of the liquefied gas from the cooling chamber;

and flow inducing means (30) in said exhaust gas passage operable to draw
the exhaust gas therethrough; characterised by at least one heat pipe (44)

comprising a closed, elongate chamber containing a working fluid under
pressure, and having one end in heat transfer relationship with a region of

said exhaust passage upstream of said flow inducing means (30) and its
other end in heat transfer relationship with a heat source, whereby, in

operation, the heat pipe (44) transfers heat from said heat source to the
exhaust gas.
