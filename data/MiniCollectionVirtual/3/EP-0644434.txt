<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a method of measuring and adjusting the gradients of an NMR apparatus and the corresponding device. Method characterised in that it consists, essentially, in selectively putting in place a set of analysis samples or in selecting such samples already installed at the places where the action of the correction coil (Bi) to be adjusted of the corresponding ferromagnetic piece, for a given field gradient is, on the one hand, predominant and, on the other hand, symmetric and/or opposite, in selectively feeding the said correction coil (Bi) to be adjusted, as well as, if appropriate, the already adjusted correction coils, in sampling the NMR signal from the said analysis samples, in visually displaying the said signal, after conversion, into the frequency field, in setting the feed current of the correction coil (Bi) to be adjusted, by observing, in real time, the change in the frequency spectrum of the NMR signal from the said analysis samples, until a configuration of the spectrum is obtained corresponding to complete compensation of the gradient influenced and, finally, in performing these operations for all of the correction coils, in a predetermined order.
