<ABSTRACT>
Systems for performing peritoneal dialysis allow the user to chose from an array of peritoneal dialysis modalities and adjust one or more individual therapy parameters within a selected modality. Still, the systems assure that the selected modality and therapy parameters satisfy preselected composite therapy criteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus
for performing peritoneal dialysis.Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) periodically
infuses sterile aqueous solution into the peritoneal
cavity. This solution is called peritoneal dialysis
solution, or dialysate. Diffusion and osmosis
exchanges take place between the solution and the
bloodstream across the natural body membranes.
These exchanges remove the waste products that the
kidneys normally excrete. The waste products
typically consist of solutes like sodium and
chloride ions, and the other compounds normally
excreted through the kidneys like urea, creatinine,
and water. The diffusion of water across the
peritoneal membrane during dialysis is called
ultrafiltration.Conventional peritoneal dialysis solutions
include dextrose in concentrations sufficient to
generate the necessary osmotic pressure to remove
water from the patient through ultrafiltration.Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis
(CAPD) is a popular form of PD. A patient performs
CAPD manually about four times a day. During CAPD,
the patient drains spent peritoneal dialysis
solution from his/her peritoneal cavity. The 
patient then infuses fresh peritoneal dialysis
solution into his/her peritoneal cavity. This drain
and fill procedure usually takes about 1 hour.Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) is another
popular form of PD. APD uses a machine,
called a cycler, to automatically infuse, dwell, and
drain peritoneal dialysis solution to and from the
patient's peritoneal cavity. APD is particularly
attractive to a PD patient, because it can be
performed at night while the patient is asleep.
This frees the patient from the day-to-day demands
of CAPD during his/her waking and working hours.The APD sequence typically last for several
hours. It often begins with an initial drain cycle
to empty the peritoneal cavity of spent dialysate.
The APD sequence then proceeds through a succession
of fill, dwell, and drain phases that follow one
after the other. Each fill/dwell/drain sequence is
called a cycle.During the fill phase, the cycler transfers
a predetermined volume of fresh, warmed dialysate
into the peritoneal cavity of the patient. The
dialysate remains (or "dwells") within the
peritoneal cavity for a time. This is called the
dwell phase. During the drain phase, the cycler
removes the spent dialysate from the peritoneal
cavity.The number of fill/dwell/drain cycles that
are required during a given APD session depends upon
the total volume of dialysate prescribed for the
patient's APD regime.APD can be and is

An automated peritoneal dialysis
apparatus including


communicating means (30, 32, 34) for establishing flow
communication with the patient's peritoneal cavity

through a pumping mechanism (P1, 59),
actuator means (76) for operating the
pumping mechanism to:


(i) drain spent peritoneal dialysis
liquid from the peritoneal cavity through the communicating means, and
(ii) infuse fresh dialysis liquid from
a source (22) into the peritoneal cavity,
control means (16) operable in a first mode
directing operation of the actuator means to conduct

a first peritoneal dialysis modality and operable in
a second mode directing operation of the actuator

means to conduct a second peritoneal dialysis
modality different than the first modality including
a first interface including input
means for the user to select the first mode or the

second mode,
a second interface including adjustment
means for the user to adjust one or more

therapy parameters of the selected modality, characterized by
first verification means for (i)
comparing individual user-adjusted parameters to

predetermined individual parameter limits; (ii)
generating an error signal when an individual user-adjusted

parameter is outside the associated
predetermined individual parameter limits; and (iii)

allowing adjustment of the individual parameter when
it is within the associated predetermined individual

parameter limits, and
second verification means for (i)
analyzing the individual therapy parameters allowed 

by the first verification means to verify that the
allowed individual therapy parameters taken together

satisfy predetermined composite therapy criteria
comprising consideration of at least resulting dwell

time or required number of cycles; (ii) returning
the user to the second interface to readjust one or

more individual therapy parameters when the
composite therapy criteria is not satisfied; and

(iii) permitting operation of the control means in
the selected mode only when the composite therapy

criteria is satisfied.
Apparatus according to claim 1

wherein the first modality includes at
least continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis or

intermittent peritoneal dialysis, and

wherein the adjustment means for the first
modality allows at least one of the following

individual therapy parameters to be adjusted in
response to input from the user: (1) the total

dialysate volume to be infused during the therapy
session; (2) the total time allotted for the

therapy; (3) the volume to be infused during each
fill phase; (4) the final volume to be left in the

patient at the end of the session; and (5) a different
dextrose concentration for the last fill

volume.
Apparatus according to claim 2

wherein the second modality includes at
least tidal peritoneal dialysis, and

wherein the adjustment means for the first
modality allows at least one of the following

individual therapy parameters to be adjusted in
response to input from the user: (1) the total

dialysate volume to be infused during the therapy
session; (2) the total time allotted for the 

therapy; (3) the volume to be infused during the
initial tidal fill phase; (4) the final volume to be

left in the patient at the end of the session; (5)
a different dextrose concentration for the last fill

volume; and (6) the fill volume to be infused and
drained periodically, expressed as a percentage of

the total therapy volume; (7) the number of full

ultrafiltrate expected from the patient during the
session.
Apparatus according to claim 3

wherein the second verification means that
analyzes the individual therapy parameters for tidal

peritoneal dialysis includes the predetermined
composite therapy criteria comprising comparing the

expected ultrafiltrate to a predetermined percentage
of selected therapy value.
