<DESCRIPTION>
 Phenol and pyridi nol derivatives as l usitropic agents.The present invention relates to the use of certain fused aryl derivatives as lusitropic agents 5 in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where there is a component of diastolic failure.'(,WO 91/17987 discloses fused aryl derivatives as agonists of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.10 It has now been found that these derivatives enhance myocardial relaxation i.e. have positive lusitropic activity and are therefore of use in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where there is a component of diastolic failure.Accordingly in a first aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the 15 formula (1) :Formula (1)20 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein :A is N or CH25 R0 is OH or a bioprecursor thereof,R1 is A°CO2H, P(X)(OH)(OR2), SO2H, SO3H or 5-tetrazolyl or a bioprecursor thereof,Aθ is a single bond, CH , CHF, CF2, CR3(OR4), CO or C(OR5)(OR6),30R is phenyl, C3_5cycloalkyl, C3_5Cycloalkyl-Cι_4alkyl, or C^galkyl optionally substituted by C1.4a.koxy,R3 is H, methyl or ethyl,35R4 is H or Cι_3alkyl,R5 and R^ are each Cι_3alkyl or together form a 1,2-ethanediyl group or 1,3-propanediyl group,40X is O or S and 

Ar is 1-naphthyl optionally substituted in the 4-position by hydroxy or C^galkoxy, 2- naphthyl optionally substituted in the 1-position by hydroxy or C^.^alkoxy, 3-phenanthryl, 9-phenanthryl, 2-quinolinyl, 4-quinolinyl, 3-thianaphthenyl or 2-benzofuranyl in the manufacture of a medicament having positive lusitropic activity.In a second aspect the present invention provides a method of enhancing myocardial relaxation which comprises administering to a host in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.In a third aspect the present invention provides a method of treating cardiovascular disease where there is a component of diastolic failure which comprises administering to a host in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of such diseases include congestive heart failure, angina, hypenension and cardiomyopathy (Kenakin el al.. J- Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991, 257, 1189-1197).Examples of compounds of the formula (1) and suitable substituent values are as disclosed in WO 91/17987.Preferably R1 is P(O)(OH)(OR2) or a bioprecursor thereof as defined in WO 91/17987.Particular compounds of the formula (1) include :ethyl
