<ABSTRACT>
Embroidery machine with a preferably vertically arranged cloth plane and with fastening elements (cloth shafts (11,12)) arranged horizontally in parallel for the embroidery cloth, a plurality of upper and lower horizontal guides (1, 2) being arranged distributed over the length of the embroidery machine, in each case an upper and a lower horizontal guide being connected by means of vertical connections (3) to form a horizontal-guide element and such horizontal-guide elements being adjusted vertically by a respective positioning drive (4) in guides arranged fixedly relative to the machine.

<CLAIMS>
An embroidery machine with a preferably vertically arranged fabric plane
and horizontally and parallel arranged fabric shafts (11, 12) for the embroidery

fabric, wherein several horizontal guides (1, 2) are arranged distributed over the
length of the embroidery machine, and respectively an upper and lower

horizontal guide (1, 2) is connected by vertical connections (3) to a horizontal
guide element, wherein the horizontal guide elements are vertically adjustable by

a positioning drive (4) in guides (6) arranged fixed to the machine, and the
horizontal guides (1, 2) arranged at one or both ends of the machine are

equipped with a horizontal positioning drive (8),

characterised in that respectively in the upper and lower horizontal guides (1, 2),
horizontally displaceable carriers (7) are arranged on which bearings (17) or

mountings (10) are secured for the fabric shafts, wherein the carriers and hence
the fabric shafts are displaceable horizontally directly by the horizontal

positioning drive (8).
An embroidery machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
vertical positioning drives of all horizontal guide elements are synchronised

mechanically, hydraulically or electrically/electronically.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that the horizontal drives (8) in the upper and lower horizontal guides (1, 2)

are synchronised mechanically, hydraulically or electronically.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 3, characterised
in that in the case of horizontal guides (1, 2) without a horizontal drive (8) only

fabric shaft mountings (10) are fastened on the carriers, wherein these fabric

shaft mountings and hence the carriers (7), in the case of horizontal
displacements of the fabric shafts by friction contact between the fabric on the 

fabric shaft and the fabric shaft support, are entrained along the horizontal
guide.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 4, characterised
in that every lower and upper carrier (7) or respectively fabric shaft mountings

(10) and -bearings are connected horizontally by light connecting elements (13)
such that the fabric shaft bearings or respectively -supports also follow the

horizontal movements without friction contact.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 5, characterised
in that at one or at both ends of the machine on the upper and lower carriers

(7), fabric shaft bearings (17) are provided in the corresponding horizontal
guides, which bearings (17) are coupled with drives (15, 16) by which the fabric

shafts can be turned in the same direction or in opposite directions for winding
and unwinding the fabric and for putting it under tension.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 6, characterised
in that by measuring the moment of rotation in the fabric shaft drives (15, 16),

the fabric tension can be measured and indicated or respectively a desired,
pre-set fabric tension can be produced.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 7, characterised
in that these upper and lower fabric shaft bearings (17), fabric shaft mountings

(10) or their carriers (7) are firmly connected by a vertical support (18), in order
to receive the fabric tension.
An embroidery machine according to one of Claims 1 - 8, characterised
in that the vertical connections (3) between the upper and lower horizontal

guides (1, 2) and also the supports (18) between the upper and lower fabric
shaft bearings (17) are changeable in their length and are able to be fixed so 

that any desired distance can be set between the lower and upper fabric shaft
and/or the embroidery fabric is thus put under tension.
