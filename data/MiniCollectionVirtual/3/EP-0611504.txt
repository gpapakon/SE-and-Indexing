<ABSTRACT>

The phase modulator (58; 286 and 310; 418, 420, and 422; 1101 and 1103, or 1303 and 1317) is driven so that counter propagating light beams (52, 54, 58, and 68; or 438 and 440) in the Sagnac loop (56, 290, 306, 436, 1304 or 1314) experience a different optical path as they pass through the loop. When the two beams (52, 54, 58, and 68; or 438 and 440) are recombined on the central beamsplitter (44, 274, 302, 400, 402, 404, 1105, or 1107) of the Sagnac loop (56, 290, 306, 436, 1304 or 1314), the two beams (52, 54, 58, and 68; or 438 and 440) interfere with each other and the data impressed as phase modulation on the light beams (52, 54, 58, and 68; or 438 and 440) by the phase modulator (58; 286 and 310; 418, 420, and 422; 1101 and 1103, or 1303 and 1317) is recovered as amplitude modulation on the output detector of the Sagnac interferometer. The system (30, 120, 130, 170, 190, 220, 250, 270, 330, 380, 685, 700, 900, 1100, 1200 or 1290) can be configured to operate full duplex on two optical fibers by using light at different wavelengths or time division multiplexing data. The system (30, 120, 130, 170, 190, 220, 250, 270, 330, 380, 685, 700, 900, 1100, 1200 or 1290) can also be configured as a multi-node network. Although the systems (30, 120, 130, 170, 190, 220, 250, 270, 330, 380, 685, 700, 900, 1100, 1200 or 1290) are very secure, alarms, intrusion control, random pathlength changes and the like can make undetected, unauthorized access to the system (30, 120, 130, 170, 190, 220, 250, 270, 330, 380, 685, 700, 900, 1100, 1200 or 1290) impossible with available interception techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of secure
communication and the protection of valuable data. More
particularly this invention involves secure fiber optic
communication systems that have application to point to point
communication links and the support of secure communication
networks.Currently, cryptographic techniques are used to
secure data during transmission electronically where the
entire communication system is not physically secure. These
techniques often involve complex keys and key holders to
assure security, driving up the overall operating cost of this
type of system. The most secure of the cryptographic units
that are affordable, are limited in speed, running at a
maximum data throughput of approximately 50 x 106 bits/sec.
(50 MBPS). This limitation is brought on because of computer
overhead required by cryptographic techniques. To circumvent
some of these problems Hughes Aircraft Co. has developed a
secure fiber optic communication system that is based on the
protection afforded by a guard mode. The guard mode carries
a large amount of optical energy protecting a data carrying
mode that has a relatively small amount of optical energy.
When an intrusion is attempted, the light from the guard mode
leaks out, an alarm trips, and the system shuts down. The
Hughes system uses a costly special optical fiber to preserve
the integrity, of the alarm and data carrying modes. It is
currently limited to operation at 13 MBPS over a maximum
distance of 1.5 km. Also because of difficulties associated
with mode integrity, the Hughes system is very difficult to
implement where connectors must be used.More recently, the Sagnac interferometer has been
suggested as a means to support data communications using
Faraday rotation (A Pseudo-Reciprocal Fiber-Optic Faraday
Rotation Sensor: Current Measurements and Data CommunicationApplications, by P. Akhavan Leilabady, A. P. Wayte, M.
Berwick, J. D. C. Jones, and D. A. Jackson, Optics
Communications, Volume 59, Number 3, page 173-176, September,
1, 1986). This system uses twisted single mode optical fiber
to reduce birefringence effects. However, it relies on
toroidal current to generate magnetic fields and can be
expected to operate at very low speeds of less than 1 MBPS.
This system may also be susceptible to noise induced by stray
magnetic fields, as one of its primary purposes is to measure
current via the magnetic field induced Faraday effect.Secure data communication links are needed that
operate at high speed for everyday business, as well as
government
