A method for manufacturing tooth prostheses such as 
crowns, bridges, inlays, or onlays, according to the following 

method steps:
 
   On a degreased impregnated stump (10) of a positive 

plaster model a thin-walled, slippery, stable, and 
relatively inelastic synthetic-resin cap (11) is mounted 

which stops on the occlusal side shortly before the 
preparation border (12) and over which is subsequently 

formed the wax model (13) by shaping a preparation 
border (12) and simultaneous establishment of the tooth 

equator (14), then a silicone layer (15) extending to the 
tooth equator is mounted occlusally on it, while meanwhile 

the plaster model is set as a master model with the inset 
wax parts in an adjustment device, that in addition on the 

silicone layer (15) a hardenable plastic (16) is layered 
on which a horizontally extending and overreaching 

orientation plate (17) is set so that this orientation 
plate (17) is fixed after hardening of the plastic (16) 

with the plastic (16), that this orientation plate (17) 
together with the affixed plastic (16), the silicone 

layer (15), the wax model (13), and the plastic cap (11) 
is lifted from the plaster stump and a filler is applied 

from the apical side from the tooth equator (14) to the 
last applied plastic (16) as well as to the adjacent 

surfaces of the orientation plate (17) and the apical 
sides of the (first) plaster cup, the exposed wax-model 

surfaces and adjacent areas right up to the orientation 
plate (17) are the coated with an electrically conductive 

material (19) and thereover by way of galvanic with a 
metal layer (20), that the metal layer (20) together with 

the wax model (13) are separated and from the occlusal 
side right up to the tooth equator (14) first a conductive 

material (21) and then by way of galvanic a metal 
layer (22) is applied and on both sides of the metal  

 
layer (20, 22) on the external surfaces of each connecting 

means are mounted, which are arranged axially and radially 
in line with each other and finally the metal layers (20, 

22) are separated form each other and from the wax 
model (13) and are used as the respective erosion 

electrodes for making a tooth replacement part 
corresponding to the wax model (13) from an erodible 

material, or the metal layer is applied with an conductive 
separating material and onto this subsequently a metal 

layer (37, 38) is galvanically applied,
 
characterised in that
 
the metal layer (22, 22) is used as a die (A, B) for 

ultrasonic erosion of an unmachined solid block of 
ceramic (35) respectively that the further metal 

layer (37, 38) is used as a die for ultrasonic erosion of 
a solid graphite body and for forming a graphite 

electrode (A, B) for spark-discharge production of a 
metallic tooth replacement part (36). 
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
metal coating (20, 22; 37, 38) and/or the metal layer 

is/are formed of copper or nickel. 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the ultrasonic erosion is carried out by axial 

oscillation of the die (A, B) at a frequency between 20 
and 25 kHz. 
The method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the grinding agent is diamond, 

silicon-carbide, boron carbide, or boron-nitride particles 
preferably with a particle size between 1 µm and 100 µm, 

more preferably between 1 and 10 µm, together with a 
coolant liquid, preferably water.  

 
The method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that first the first die (A) fixed 

solidly on the end of a ultrasound die holder is advanced 
into the solid body (35) to be worked to erode it and then 

the die (A) is separated from the ultrasound die holder 
and is used as a support during the erosion of the 

opposite still unmachined side of the workpiece. 
The method according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the unmachined solid body (35) 

and/or the workpiece (35) lying in the support with only 
one half machined is pressed by air pressure, preferably 

at up to 4 bar on a planar surface during the erosive 
machining.
