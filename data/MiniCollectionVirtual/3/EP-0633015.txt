<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 
10
 for holding and subsequently 
releasing a solid compact medicament, such as a caplet 


(A)
 during processing comprises first and second 
members 
12,14
. First and second members 
12,14
 each has 
surface 
16,22
, respectively, comprising at least one 
substantially similar notch 
18,24
 opposed and 
correspondingly aligned one another and extending 

beyond the respective surfaces 
16,22
. Adjacent each 
notch 
18,24
, the respective surface 
16,22
 has a chamber 

26,32
. A portion of each notch 
18,24
 is freely 
disposed in the chamber 
26,32
 of the other so that the 
opposed notches 
18,24
, defining a gripping jaw, can 
move freely in the chamber 
26,32
 of the other. 
Further, means are provided for urging the first and 

second member 
12,14
 from a first position wherein the 
gripping jaw 
34
 formed by the opposed notches 
18,24
 are 
open to receive and subsequently release a solid 

compact medicament, to a second position wherein the 
gripping jaw 
34
 at least partially closes firmly 
capturing a circumferential portion of the solid 

compact medicament therein for processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for
holding a solid compact medicament during processing.
More particularly, the invention concerns a solid
compact medicament holding apparatus in which
overlapping portions of the medicament, such as a
caplet, are exposed to a coating process to produce a
coated solid compact medicament which can resemble a
conventional capsule.In the marketing of solid compact
medicaments, there is a clear consumer preference for a
shiny, capsule-like, single or multiple color solid
dosage form that is easy to swallow. Generally,
gelatinous coatings have been used to achieve a shiny
surface on a solid dosage form, also referred to herein
as a caplet, pill, tablet, and the like. Caplets are
solid, substantially cylindrical shaped medicaments;
pills are solid, substantially round shaped
medicaments; and, tablets are solid, substantially
spherical shaped medicaments (see for reference Seitz
et al., "Tablet Coating", Chapter 12, Page 346, The
Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy). One
method of making caplets which has been used to meet
the needs of the pharmaceutical consumer is described
and illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,965,089 to Sauter
et al, and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,990,358 and 4,921,108,
both to Berta et al. In particular, Sauter '089 and
Berta '358 each teaches a method and apparatus for
holding and dipping one end portion of a caplet into a
gelatin pool and then positioning the caplet so as to 
dip the uncoated end portion of the caplet into a second gelatin pool of a different
color. However, a major drawback of the apparatus and methods taught in these
patents is that a constant force spring is relied upon to hold the caplet during the dip
coating process and also during caplet transfer to other processing steps, such as
drying and packaging. As can be readily appreciated, such a constant spring force
could impart a shear force which would be unacceptably large on some abrasion
sensitive material included in solid compact medicaments. Acetyl salicylic acid, also
known as aspirin, and gelatinous coatings which have not been completely cured,
are two examples of abrasion sensitive materials which could be damaged by such
shear force.Further, in US 2,415,127 a dipping board for dipping objects entirely or partially in
fluids for coating is described. The dipping board includes a rectangular frame
having a pair of side members, each having longitudinal grooves for securing an
end member. The board further comprises a first set of bars mounted transversely
in the frame

Apparatus for holding a solid compact medicament (A) during processing,

characterized by:

a first member (12) comprising a first notch (18) and a first chamber (20) adjacent
said first notch (18), said first notch (18) having a portion extending beyond the

surface (16) of said first member (12);
a second member (14) comprising a second notch (24) and a second chamber (26)
adjacent said second notch (24), said second notch (24) having a portion extending

beyond the surface (22) of said second member (14);
said portions extending of said first (18) and second (24) notches are freely
disposed within the chamber of the other, forming opposed notches, so that said

opposed notches can move cooperatively within said chambers (20, 26); and,
means for displacing said first (12) and second (14) members from a first position
wherein said opposed notches are spaced apart thereby defining an open gripping

jaw (34) for receiving and subsequently releasing a solid compact medicament (A),
to a second position wherein said opposed notches are at least partially closed for

engaging a circumferential portion of the solid compact medicament (A).
The apparatus recited in claim 1 further characterized by means, cooperating
with said second member (14), for precisely positioning a predetermined portion of

the solid compact medicament (A) for processing. 
The apparatus recited in claim 2 characterized in that said positioning means is
a stop plate (40) spaced a predetermined distance from said gripping jaw (34).
The apparatus recited in claim 2 characterized in that said stop plate (40) is
adjustable relative to said gripping jaw (34).
The apparatus recited in claim 3 characterized in that said stop plate (40) is
provided with a depression (41) aligned with the longitudinal axis of the gripping jaw

(34), said depression (41) being sized to accommodate an end portion of the solid
compact medicament (A).
The apparatus recited in claim 1 further characterized by means, cooperating
with said first member (12), for urging said solid compact medicament (A) from said

gripping jaw (34), said urging means being a bar-like member (42).
The apparatus recited in claim 1 characterized in that said gripping jaw (34)
comprises an interior wall (52), said interior wall (52) being provided with means for

compliantly engaging the solid compact medicament (A), said compliant means (50)
being a rubber material.
The apparatus recited in claim 1 characterized in that a portion of said gripping
jaw (34) is provided with a tension means (25) mounted thereon defining a cusp for

graspably securing a portion of said solid compact medicament (A).
