<ABSTRACT>
The hinge comprises a hinge-piece (4) solidly attached to the face part (1) of a spectacles frame and fitted with a cam (21), and a hinge-piece (5) connected via a device having permanent magnets to the arm (2). This device has a casing (10) comprising a front face (20) intended to interact with the cam (21) and a housing (11) in which an extension (12), solidly attached to the hinge-piece (5), is mounted so that it can slide. The casing (10) and this extension (12) are fitted with two permanent magnets (14, 25) which mutually attract so that the front face (20) is strongly pressed against the cam (21) in order to define open and folded positions of the arm (2). By this arrangement, a springless elastic hinge having simple design is obtained.

A hinge for spectacles comprising two parts (4, 6) connected together 
rotatably, a first one (4) of the parts being designed for fastening 

to the face member (1) of the frame of the spectacles and the second 
(5) of these parts being connected to the temple of the spectacles 

(2) so as to be capable of a sliding motion in a longitudinal direction 
against the effect of a return force, the hinge including a device designed 

for biasing the temple of the spectacles (2) into, at least, one 
predetermined position relative to the face member (1), this devi
ce including 
at least a first permanent magnet (51, 52) integral with the 

temple of the spectacles (2) and at least a second permanent magnet 
(54) integral with the second part (5) and cooperating in such a manner 

with the first permanent magnet that the temple of the spectacles be 
biased by said return force along a direction of motion towards said 

first part, characterized in that each one of the first and second permanent 
magnets (51, 52, 54) includes an alternating succession of positive 

and negative magnetizations (53, 54) arranged in succession parallelly 
to said direction of motion, these successions of alternating 

first and second permanent magnets being arranged substantially parallelly 
to each other and the whole arrangement being constructed so that 

the temple of the spectacles (2) be biased towards the open and folded 
positions thereof by the sliding of the second permanent magnet(s) (54) 

along the first permanent magnet(s) (51, 52). 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that the alternating 
successions (53, 55) are arranged in such a manner that, in the open 

position and the folded positions of the temple of the spectacles (2),  
 

the positive magnetizations of the first permanent magnet(s) (51, 52) 
be located substantially opposite the negative magnetizations of the 

second permanent magnet(s) (54) and vice versa, so that the temple of 
the spectacles (2) be biased towards these two positions. 
A hinge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it includes 
a cam (21) integral with the first part (4) and a piece (10) integral 

with the second part (5) of the hinge, this piece (10) being biased 
against the cam (21) by the magnetic return force produced by the 

permanent magnets (51, 52, 54). 
A hinge according to claim 3, characterized in that said piece is 
comprised of a casing (10) integral with the temple (2) and including a 

housing (11) into which is disposed slidably an extension (12) of the 
second part (5), the casing (10) including a front portion designed for 

cooperating with said cam (21), the housing (11) being provided with at 
least one of said first permanent magnets (51, 52), of which the succession 

of alternating magnetizations (53) is arranged parallelly opposite 
the alternating succession of the magnetizations (55) of the second 

permanent magnet (54) provided on said extension (12) in such a 
manner that the extension (12) be biased in the direction of the bottom 

of the housing (11). 
A hinge according to claim 3, characterized in that it includes a 
spring (41) which abuts, on the one hand, against a part (17, 56) integral 

with the casing (10) and, on the other hand, against the extension 
(12), and which is arranged so as to push the extension (12) in the 

direction of the bottom of said housing (11).
