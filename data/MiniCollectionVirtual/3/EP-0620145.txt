<ABSTRACT>
An electric overhead conveyor of a vehicle (7) has devices for processing a transport order. The electric overhead conveyor is assigned a CPU (6). The vehicle has a computing unit (72) which can communicate with the CPU (6) and the said vehicle also has devices for providing drive (340, 341, 342), control (72), points setting and handling (330) for the goods to be transported.

An electric conveyor with a vehicle with apparatus for processing 
a conveying order, a central processing unit (6) being assigned to 

the electric conveyor, and a computer unit (72), which can 
communicate with the central processing unit (6), and also drive 

apparatus (340,341,342), control apparatus (72) and apparatus for 
handling (330) goods to be conveyed being disposed on the vehicle 

(7), characterised in that the electric conveyor is an electric 
overhead conveyor and in that the apparatus for setting the points 

is disposed on the vehicle (7). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 apparatus for producing compressed air (320, 325) is 
disposed on the vehicle (7) for the handling (330) of the goods to 

be conveyed. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the handling apparatus (330) is connected to 
the vehicle (7) by means of variable-length components which are 

rigid in the direction of travel of the vehicle (7) and flexible at right 
angles to the direction of travel of the vehicle (7). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the variable-length components are plastic belts (337) which 
are not very thick and are very wide and which can be rolled up on 

a roll (334) by means of a winding device (333).  
 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised 
in that
, in at least one of the plastic belts (337), there is disposed 
at a short distance from the upper extremity thereof a metal body 

(338) which can be detected by a sensor (339) disposed 
immediately adjacent the plastic belt (337) as soon as the plastic 

belt (337) is almost completely unwound from the roll (334). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 

characterised in that
, on the roll (334), there is disposed an 
incremental measuring device (343) to record the number of 

revolutions of the roll (334). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 6, 
characterised in that
, on the handling apparatus (330), there 
are disposed gripping devices with grippers (332) for the purpose of 

picking up bobbins (20) or bobbin-like goods on the circumferential 
face thereof. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the grippers (332) are so disposed on the handling apparatus 
(330) that the bobbins (20) can be conveyed with bobbin axes 

disposed substantially horizontally and at right angles to the 
direction of travel. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 7 or 8, 

characterised in that
 the gripping devices are disposed on the 
handling apparatus (330) at right angles to the direction of travel.  

 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 7 
to 9, 
characterised in that
 the gripping devices can be actuated 
independently of each other. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 7 
to 10, 
characterised in that
 the opening width of the grippers (332) 
can be altered by means of a parallelogram guide mechanism. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 4 
to 11, 
characterised in that
 the motor (340) can be switched off by 
means of a load removal switch (336) disposed on the winding 

device (333). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 4 
to 13, 
characterised in that
 the winding device (333) can be driven 
and braked by means of a sliding rotor motor. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 13, 
characterised in that
 the handling apparatus (330) is lockable 
in its uppermost position on the vehicle (7). 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in claim 14, 
characterised 
in that
 sprung-mounted members are disposed on the locking device 
to accommodate the handling apparatus (330) in a pre-tensioned 

manner. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 15, 
characterised in that
 the track (47) can be cleaned by the 
waste air from the compressor (325) in the direction of travel 

upstream of the vehicle (7).  
 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 16, 
characterised in that
 an incremental measuring device (751) 
is disposed on the vehicle (7) for the distance measuring system. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 7 
to 17, 
characterised in that
 the gripping devices are disposed on the 

handling apparatus (330) so as to rotate about a vertical axis for the 
purpose of rotating gripped goods. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 7 
to 18, 
characterised in that
 the lateral distance between each of the 
gripping devices can be modified in such a way that, when the 

grippers (332) are opened as far as possible, the gripping devices 
are rotatable about a vertical axis. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 19, 
characterised in that
 the handling apparatus (330) is disposed 
on the vehicle (7) so as to rotate about a vertical axis. 
An electric overhead conveyor as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 20, 
characterised in that
 a bobbin safety device which is 
independent of the energy supply can be initiated by the handling 

apparatus (330) in the wound state.
