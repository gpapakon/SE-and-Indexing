<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a light strip luminaire having an elongate housing which has a U-shaped cross-section and extends at the ends in the shape of protruding caps, suitable for accommodating a rod-shaped lamp between the caps. The light strip luminaire is characterised in that a plastic insert (20) is inserted in a cap (11), has a socket (21), accessible from outside, for accommodating a Euro flat plug and is connected via contact elements to the current-carrying installation of the luminaire. The insert is completely integrated into the luminaire housing so that its appearance is not impaired. The insert can be assembled by plugging into the housing from the open side, without any additional connecting parts or complicated assembly operations being necessary.

Lighting strip lamp with an elongated housing which is 
U-shaped in cross section and is continued at the end 

faces in the form of projecting caps, and which is suited 
for receiving a rod-shaped lamp between these caps, characterised 

in that in one cap (11) there is plugged in 
an insertion part (20) of plastics material which comprises 

a socket (21) being accessible from the outside and having 
the elongated hexagonal cross section of an Euro plug 

and which is connected via contact elements (30) to the 
current-conveying installation of the lamp, the insertion 

part (20) being completely integrated in the lamp housing. 
Lighting strip lamp as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that for guiding the insertion part during pushing it 

into the housing, strips (16) are integrally formed with 
the housing and received by grooves (23) of the insertion 

part. 
Lighting strip lamp as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
by the following features: 


in the bottom of the socket (21) of the insertion part 
there are formed two perforations (24) each destined 

for receiving a plug pin; 
each perforation is associated with a chamber (25) integrally 
formed with the insertion part; 
each chamber receives a contact element (30) which 
is suited for receiving a plug pin and for connecting 

an electric line. 
Lighting strip lamp as claimed in claim 3, characterised 
by a contact element (30) having the following features:  

 

it is basically U-shaped with a web (31) and two 
flanges (35); 
the two flanges are bent to an U-shape and form at 
their end regions a receptacle (37) for a pin; 
a perforation (32) is formed in the U-shaped web destined 
for a plug pin. 
Lighting strip lamp as claimed in claim 4, characterised 
in that an angle (34) projecting at the chamber is formed 

in the U-shaped web (31) which is suited for inserting 
an electric line.
