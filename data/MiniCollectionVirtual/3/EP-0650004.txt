<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a plastic pipe having improved resistance, inter alia to methanol-containing fuels and having improved mechanical properties. This is achieved by a multilayer plastic pipe comprising at least   I. an outer layer made from a moulding composition based on polyamide (nylon) II. an interlayer, adjacent to the outer layer, made from a moulding composition based on the mixture of     a. from 95 to 99% by weight of a linear, crystalline polyester and b. from 1 to 5% by weight of a compound containing at least two isocyanate groups, where the isocyanate groups originating from II.b. are present in the mixture of II.a. and II.b. in a concentration of from 0.03 to 0.3% by weight, III. an interlayer made from a moulding composition based on polyamide, IV. an interlayer, adjacent to the inner layer, made from a moulding composition based on a mixture of     a. from 50 to 90% by weight of a polyamide and b. from 10 to 50% by weight of a polyacrylate or polyalkyl acrylate,     V. an inner layer made from a moulding composition based on polyvinylidene fluoride, where the adjacent layers are in each case adhesively bonded to one another. The invention enables plastic pipes having the desired improved property profile to be obtained.
