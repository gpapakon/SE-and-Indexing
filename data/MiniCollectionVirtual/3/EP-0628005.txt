<ABSTRACT>
An easy opening plastic bag includes a plastic front panel (12), a plastic rear panel (14), and plastic left and right end panels (16, 18) coupled to the front and rear panels. A plastic gusset (22) is formed at the top of the bag and is joined to the front, rear, left, and right panels. A first frangible portion (30) is disposed near a top of the front panel, and a second frangible portion (34) is disposed near a top of the rear panel. Tearing the first and second frangible portions allows a portion of the bag to rotate away from the remainder of the bag about an axis parallel to the top wall of the bag. A third frangible portion (36) is provided in the bag and extends substantially perpendicular to the top wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an easy opening
flexible plastic bag especially capable of holding
highly compressed products, such as disposable diapers,
and capable of being manufactured at high-speed by
automated machinery.Flexible plastic bags are known in the art for
carrying flexible articles such as disposable diapers,
incontinent briefs, and catamenial pads. These
flexible articles may be compressed while being
inserted into the plastic bag so that transportation,
storing, marketing, and consumption of the product are
more convenient. However, opening plastic bags
containing such compressed articles can be quite
difficult. The greater the amount of compression, the
stronger the bag must be, and hence the more difficult
the bag is to open. Parents are familiar with the 
difficult experience of controlling a wiggling infant
with one hand while attempting to open a bag of diapers
with the other hand. Several diaper bags have been
produced which include lines of perforations therein so
that the bag can be easily opened. Incorporating
perforations in such a bag, however, is disadvantageous
where the articles within the bag are highly
compressed, i.e., compressed in thickness 25%, or
preferably 50% or more, relative to their initial
uncompressed thickness. A plastic bag with
perforations containing such highly compressed articles
may burst open if dropped during transportation or if
exposed to rough handling. Therefore, what is needed
is a plastic bag which is easy to open yet strong
enough to contain flexible articles, preferably
compressed articles, and most preferably highly
compressed articles.In Figure 1, a flexible plastic bag containing
compressed disposable diapers exerts a force in the
direction of arrow A since this is the compression
direction of the diapers. Compressive forces are
usually applied perpendicular to the planes into which
articles are folded. The force A creates a
circumferential force in the bag plastic around the
outside of the bag. Therefore, perforations or areas
of weakened plastic which are disposed perpendicular to
the circumferential force tend to weaken the bag, and
the bag will tend to burst open if the circumferential
forces are greater than the resistive forces in the
plastic. U.S. Patent No. 4,934,535 describes a diaper
bag which exposes this problem. This patent discloses
a side-opening mechanism in which a portion of the side
panel and a portion of the top gusset are torn away
along oval-shaped perforation lines. These bags,
however, may be subject to bursting

a gusset (22) formed at a top of said bag (10) and coupled to said front and rear panels

(12, 14);
a handle (24) joined to the front and rear panels (12, 14) and bridging the gusset (22);
characterized in that

the plastic bag further comprises:
a first frangible portion (100) disposed in the handle (24) and extending from the front
panel (12) to the rear panel (14);
a second frangible portion (104) disposed in the gusset (22) and extending from the
front panel (12) to the rear panel (14) and connected to the first frangible portion (100),

a third frangible portion (106, 112) disposed in the front panel (12) and connected to
the first and second frangible portions (100, 104); and
a fourth frangible portion (108, 114) disposed in the rear panel (14) and connected to
the first and second frangible portions (100, 104).
A bag according to claim 1,
characterized in that

said first frangible portion (100) includes a slit (102) and a plurality of perforations
(101).
A bag according to claim 2,
characterized in that

said slit (102) is disposed in the center of the handle (24)
A bag according to any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that

handle (24) toward the bottom of the bag, and then upward to respective upper corners

of one of said end panels (16, 18).
A bag according to claim 4,
characterized in that

each of said third and fourth frangible portions (106; 108) comprises a first line of
perforations connected to the first frangible portion (100), and a second line of

perforations connected to the first line of perforations and extending at an angle
therefrom to respective upper corners of said one end panel (16, 18) to allow a portion

of the gusset to rotate upward away from a gusset portion adjacent the second frangible
portion (104).
A bag according to any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that

each of said third and fourth frangible portions (106, 108) comprises vertically and
horizontally disposed lines of perforations (110).
A bag according to any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that

each of said third and fourth frangible portions (112, 114) comprises an array of
perforations which are connected to the second frangible portion (104) and extend
