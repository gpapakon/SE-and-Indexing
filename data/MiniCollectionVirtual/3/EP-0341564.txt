<ABSTRACT>
A vending machine (1) for baked foodstuff portions (60), with a storage device (4) which is arranged in a cooling zone and in which the foodstuffs are supported in a plurality of storage planes located above one another, with a baking device (6)  with a dispensing station (8) and with a transport mechanism (61) for transporting the foodstuffs from the storage device (4) to the baking device (6), is to be so designed that, whilst at the same time guaranteeing a compact design, the foodstuff transport into the transfer position between the storage device and the elevator can take place simply and quickly. This is achieved in that the storage device (4) is formed by a plurality of conveyor bands (23) which are arranged above one another and the bands of which can each be moved forwards into a position for transferring the respective foodstuff (60) from the associated conveyor band (23) onto the transport device (7).
