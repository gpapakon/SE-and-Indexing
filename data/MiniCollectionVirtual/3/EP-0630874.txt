<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing cylindrical or round shaped parts of high-Tc superconductor material containing bismuth, strontium, calcium, copper and oxygen. In this process, a preprepared finely divided oxide mixture containing organic additives is first introduced into a casting mould at room temperature. The moulded mixture is then converted into the superconducting shaped part by means of further thermal treatment.

A process for producing cylindrical or round parts
of high-T
c
 superconductor material comprising bismuth,
strontium, calcium, copper and oxygen, which

comprises processing a pre-prepared finely-divided
oxide mixture with organic additives and solvent to

form a slip, introducing the slip at room
temperature into a rotatable hollow cylinder,

uniformly distributing the mixture by rotating the
hollow cylinder while the solvent begins to

evaporate, and converting the shaped mixture into
the superconducting shaped part by subsequent thermal

treatment.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein bismuth
is partially replaced by lead, the target compounds

being the crystalline phases having the ideal
composition Bi

The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
ceramic starting material for producing the castable

composition is a homogeneous, finely-divided coprecipitate
of oxalates which has been pre-decomposed

at temperatures between 250 and 800°C.
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the
ceramic starting material is processed with a solvent

mixture, a dispersant, a binder and a
plasticizer to give a castable composition. 
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
solvent mixture consists of toluene and ethanol in the

ratio of from 20 to 40% by weight of toluene and
from 60 to 80% by weight of ethanol.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
dispersant comprises a tertiary alkoxylamine having

an alkyl group having from 10 to 21 carbon atoms.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
binder is a long-chain organic ester having at least

17 carbon atoms.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
plasticizer is a phthalic ester.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein the casting composition comprises from 50 to

60% by weight of ceramic material, from 30 to 45% by
weight of solvent, from 0.2 to 4% by weight of

dispersant, from 1 to 6% by weight of binder and
from 0.2 to 2% by weight of plasticizer, based on

the total weight of the casting composition.
The process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the
casting composition is cast at room temperature into

a rotatable mold.
The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
rotation rate can be regulated and is from 100 to

6000 rpm, preferably from 2000 to 3000 rpm.
The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein a tubular
component, which is to be fitted in, of silver

or a silver-coated ceramic material is preferably
used as substrate material.
The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
cross section of the mold is reduced on the open end 

face by an end ring.
The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
tubular component is converted by suitable subsequent

thermal treatment between 600°C and 920°C into
a superconducting component having a high critical

current density and predominantly comprising the
target compound having the ideal composition
