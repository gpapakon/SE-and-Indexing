<ABSTRACT>
A laser-excited capillary array scanner including a plurality of capillaries (21) having a parallel, side-by-side, coplanar relationship and a laser-excited confocal fluorescence detector (18) for detecting fluorescence from a selected interior volumes of each of said capillaries (21) sequentially and repetitively during electrophoresis or other separation method. The invention also relates to a method of analyzing a plurality of capillaries (21), with a single scanner (30), by scanning a plurality of capillary passages in side-by-side relationship, and periodically and repetitively detecting florescence from each capillary passage during electrophoresis or any other separation procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a capillary array scanner and method, and more particularly, to a capillary array confocal fluorescence scanner and method for detecting electrophoretic, chromatographic or other separations performed on arrays of capillaries.Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has found widespread application in analytical and biomedical research, and the scope and sophistication of CE is still rapidly advancing1-5. Gel-filled capillaries have been employed for the rapid separation and analysis of synthetic polynucleotides6, DNA sequencing fragments7-11 and DNA restriction fragments12,13. Open-tube capillary electrophoresis has attained subattomole detection levels in amino acid separations14, and proven its utility for the separation of proteins, viruses and bacteria15. Separation of the optical isomers of dansyl amino acids has also been successfully demonstrated16. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and on-column derivation can all be performed in capillary columns, demonstrating the utility of capillaries as an analytical and micropreparative tool4,5.The advantages of CE arise intrinsically from the use of a small inside diameter (20-200 µm) capillary. High electric fields can be applied along small diameter fused-silica capillaries without a significant increase in the temperature of the separation medium or column. Since the electrophoretic velocity of the charged species is proportional to the applied field, CE can achieve rapid, high-resolution separation. The reduced Joule-heating in CE is a result of the very low current passing through the capillary, the large surface-to-volume ratio of the capillary channel, the use of thin capillary walls (-50-150µm), and the high thermal conductivity of the wall material 1.Although CE provides rapid analysis, thus far the total throughput is not high because generally only one capillary can be analyzed at a time. Developing a method to increase the throughput of CE is a challenging and important task. One possible approach is to employ a much higher electric field which would provide faster separations. Higher electric fields, however, often introduce overheating of the columns and column failure.An article in Biotechniques vol.9, no.1 (1990) pages 74-79, "DNA Sequencing Separations in Capillary Gels on a Modified Commercial DNA Sequencing Instrument", R. Zagursky and R. McCormick, discloses the use of a 488-nm argon laser beam, deflected by a mirror mounted on the shaft of a digitally controlled stepper

A scanner for exciting and detecting radiation from a plurality of adjacent capillary passages comprising:

a plurality of transparent capillaries (21) in side-by-side coplanar relationship, the capillaries having cylindrical walls providing capillary passages extending in a first direction;
a source of radiant energy of a first wavelength;
an objective lens (11) for receiving and focussing said radiant energy (29) at an excitation volume (21a) in said passages;
means (30) arranged to provide continuous relative movement between each of said passages and said radiant energy in a direction perpendicular to the capillaries so that said excitation volume (21a) is sequentially and repetitively at a specific position within each one of said capillary passages so as to excite material in said excitation volume (21a) and cause the material to radiate energy at a different wavelength;
said objective lens (11) serving to collect said radiant energy and direct it to an optical system which includes confocal spatial filter means (16) and spectral filter means (17) to transmit emitted radiant energy at said different wavelength and reject radiation at other wavelengths;
a detection system (18) for receiving said emitted radiation and generating a signal; and
computer means arranged to receive and process said signal to provide an output representative of the material at the excitation volume (21a) in each of
 said capillary passages (21).
A scanner as in Claim 1 in which said means (30) arranged to provide continuous relative movement is controlled by said computer means, whereby the output can be correlated with the capillary passages.
A scanner as in Claim 2 in which each capillary passage is part of an elongated cylindrical capillary.
A scanner as in Claim 3 including means for holding a region of said capillaries (21) in a side-by-side coplanar relationship for presentation to the focussed radiant energy.
A scanner as in Claim 2 or 4 in which the ends (22,23) of said capillaries (21) are separable for individual manipulation and loading.
A scanner as in Claim 1 wherein said excitation radiant energy excites material which emits radiant energy at a plurality of wavelengths and said optical system includes a plurality of confocal, spatial and spectral filter means (11,12,16,17) for selectively directing the radiant emitted energy of different wavelengths to different locations and a plurality of detection means each receiving emitted energy at a selected wavelength and providing a corresponding output signal.
A method of detecting fluorescence from DNA sequencing fragments electrophoretically separated in
 capillary passages of a plurality of cylindrical capillaries (21), comprising the steps of:

positioning a region of said plurality of capillaries (21) in side-by-side coplanar relationship;
exciting an excitation volume (21a) in said capillary passages with light energy of a first wavelength focussed therein by an objective lens (11) to cause fragments to fluoresce at a different wavelength;
providing relative continuous movement between said cylindrical capillaries (21) and said focussed light in a direction perpendicular to the capillaries whereby the excitation volume is sequentially and repetitively as a specific position within each one of the capillary passages;
collecting the fluorescently emitted light from said predetermined volumes in each of said capillary passages with said objective lens (11);
spectrally and confocal spatially filtering said fluorescently emitted light energy to reject light at said first wavelength and passing said emitted light at said different wavelength;
applying the filtered emitted light to a detector (18) to generate an output signal representative of the fluorescence from said fragments in each of said capillary passages; and
receiving and processing said signal to provide an output representative of the material at the excitation volume (21a) in each of said capillary passages (21).
