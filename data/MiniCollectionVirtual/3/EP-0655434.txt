<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aromatic diamine compounds. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to an 
aromatic diamine compound which can be used as a hole transport 
material for organic EL (electroluminescence) device, a hole transport 
material for organic thin film photocell, a carrier transport material 
for electrophotograph, etc.; as well as to an aromatic diamine compound 
which is useful as a precursor for the synthesis of the above 
aromatic diamine compound. As the aromatic diamine compounds used for the above 
applications, there can be cited, for example, 1,1-bis(4-di-p-tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane 
represented by the following formula 
(3), used as a hole transport material for organic EL device [U.S. 
Patent 4,539,507]  
 
and N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(m-tolyl)benzidine represented by the 
following formula (4), used as a hole transport material for organic EL 
device [J. Appl. Physics, 2, 269 (1988)]. 
The compounds represented by the above formulas (3) 
and (4), however, have low melting points [174°C in the case of the 
compound (3) and 165°C in the case of the compound (4)] and low 
glass transition temperatures [77.7°C in the case of the compound (3) 
and 66.5°C in the case of the compound (4)]; as a result, when they 
are used in an organic EL device and the EL device is operated, they  
 
cause crstallization by the heat generated during the operation and 
the hole transport layer is deformed and an emission reduced. Thus, 
it has been required to develop a new material which has a high 
melting point and a high glass transition temperature and which is 
unlikely to cause crystallization. The object of the present invention is to provide an 
aromatic diamine compound which is free from the problems of the 
prior art and which is unlikely to cause crystallization by heat and 
has a melting point and a glass transition temperature both higher 
than those of conventional compounds, and an aromatic diamine 
compound which is useful as a precursor for the synthesis of the 
above aromatic diamine compound. The requirements for a compound having a high melting 
point and a high glass transition temperature are, for example: 
(1) a high molecular weight, (2) high molecular symmetry, and (3) good planeness of a molecule. The requirements for a compound having an improved 
amorphous state preservation and resistance to crystallization are:  
 
(1) low molecular symmetry, (2) bulky substituent(s), and (3) no planeness a molecule. The contradictory requirements mentioned above
