<ABSTRACT>
A cigarette filter (12) connected to a tobacco rod (14) is provided 
with air dilution holes (18,20) 

which extend radially into the fibrous material (17) of the filter to a 
depth of about 1.0 to 

about 4.0 millimeters. When a smoker draws on the cigarette, air admitted 
into the air 

dilution holes flows to a central or core region of the filter and thence 
to the smoker's 

mouth. Mainstream smoke from the tobacco rod flows into the filter and is 
diverted to 

an annular region surrounding the core region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cigarette filters and more particularly to 
a cigarette filter with air dilution means. It is well known in the cigarette filter art to provide air ventilation or air 
dilution means for introducing ambient air into the filter to dilute the mainstream 
smoke passing from the tobacco rod through the filter. As used herein, "air dilution" 
or "air ventilation" refers to ambient air as a diluent, and is the ratio usually expressed 
as a percentage, of the volume of air drawn through the air dilution means to the total 
volume of air and aerosol drawn through the cigarette and exiting the mouth end of the 
cigarette. Dilution of the mainstream smoke reduces the quantity of particulate matter 
and gas phase components of the smoke that is delivered to the smoker. Ventilating air has heretofore been introduced into the filter in several 
ways, but primarily by the use of porous or perforated wrappers for the tobacco rod 
and/or filter. The most common means for introducing ventilating air into a cigarette 
has been by means of mechanical or laser perforations of the tipping paper and the 
filter plug wrap. Typically, a plurality of perforations or openings are provided in one 
or more rows arranged circumferentially about the filter adjacent the tobacco rod end 
thereof The openings may be provided in the tipping paper and plug wrap prior to or 
during assembly of the cigarette. Cigarette filters may be made with many different types of filtration 
materials, one of the most common materials being a rod of fibrous material, such as a 
cellulose acetate fiber tow. When a smoker draws on the mouth end of a cigarette 
with a conventional air diluted cellulose acetate filter, air flows through the air dilution 
openings in the tipping paper and plug wrap in a direction generally transversely to the 
longitudinal axis of the filter until it meets the flow of mainstream smoke from the 
tobacco rod. The diluting air flow is diverted by the pressure drop across the filter in a 
longitudinal direction toward the mouth end of the filter. In this conventional air 
diluted filter construction, the mainstream smoke flow is usually concentrated in a 
central or core portion of the filter and the dilution air flows primarily in the annular  
 
portion of the filter surrounding the central portion and between such central portion 
and the filter plug wrap. Such flow of mainstream smoke and diluting air is evident from a visual 
inspection of the staining pattern at the mouth end of the

<CLAIMS>
A cigarette comprising a tobacco rod and a filter rod for filtering mainstream 
smoke from the tobacco rod, said filter rod having a tobacco rod end and a 

mouth end, said filter rod being made of a fibrous filter material overwrapped 
with a plug wrap, said filter rod having a core region extending longitudinally 

of the filter rod and an annular region surrounding said core region, a tipping 
paper connecting said tobacco rod with said filter rod, air dilution means 

extending into the fibrous filter material for admitting ambient diluting air into 
said core region of the filter rod such that the flow of dilution air is 

concentrated in said core region and the flow of mainstream smoke is 
concentrated in said annular region, said air dilution means comprising a 

plurality of holes located adjacent the tobacco rod end of the filter rod and 
extending through the tipping paper and plug wrap and into the fibrous filter 

material of the filter rod to a substantial depth sufficient to concentrate 
substantially all of the flow of diluting air in the core region of the filter rod, 

said filter rod being free of other air dilution flows into said filter rod so that 
the flow of mainstream smoke from the tobacco rod end of the filter rod 

through the annular region to the mouth end of the filter rod is substantially 
undiluted by air from the holes and substantially all dilution air admitted to the 

filter rod through the holes flows to the mouth end of the filter rod through the 
core region of the filter rod. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein the depth of said holes is about 2.0 mm or 
greater. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein the depth of at least some of said holes is 
about 4.0 mm. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein the depth of said holes is in the range of 1.0 
to 4.0 millimeters. 
The cigarette of claim 1, including at least eight holes. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein said fibrous filter material is cellulose acetate. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein said holes comprise at least two rows of 
holes, each hole extending radially into the fibrous material, the holes of one 

row having a depth greater than the holes of another row. 
The cigarette of claim 7, wherein the holes of said one row are closest to the 
tobacco rod and have a depth of about 4.0 millimeters, the holes of said 

another row having a depth of about 2.0 millimeters. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein the amount of air dilution is in the range of 
about 30-95%. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein said holes are laser-formed holes. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein said holes have a generally oval or oblong 
cross-section. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein said filter plug wrap is a carbon-filled paper. 
The cigarette of claim 7, including ten holes in each row of holes. 
The cigarette of claim 1, wherein the fibrous filter material is polypropylene or 
polyester.
