<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an airbag having a supporting body (3) for a gas bag (18) which can be loaded by means of an inflating device (17) and which is concealed in the non-operating condition beneath a casing part of a vehicle dashboard (6). In order to be able to incorporate airbags of the same generic type in existing vehicle dashboards in a simple manner, it is proposed that fastening means be provided on the supporting body (3) which fasten the airbag (1) in an inherently open concavity (glove compartment 16). Furthermore, the casing part covering the airbag is formed by a covering cap (2) which is held on the supporting body (3) and the outline of which is geometrically adapted to the concavity (glove compartment 16) which receives the airbag (1).

Arrangement consisting of a vehicle instrument panel (6) and an airbag device (1)
which comprises a carrier body (3) for a gas bag (18) which can be influenced by an

inflating device (17) and which in the inactive state is hidden in a recess in the vehicle
instrument panel (6) below a housing part which is formed as a cover cap (2) and

comprises an outer contour which for the purpose of inserting the airbag device (1)
into the recess is tailored to suit the geometry of the said recess at least in sections, the

said housing part being able to pivot at least partially with respect to the carrier body
(3) by way of a hinge means (11) and further comprising attachment means allocated

to the carrier body (3) by means of which attachment means the airbag device (1) is
held in the recess, characterised in that the cover cap (2) comprises at least one nonrigid

circumferential sealing lip (15) and the recess receiving the airbag device (1) is
formed by means of an open depression, originally designed as a storage

compartment, in the vehicle instrument panel (6).
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the sealing lip (15) is directed
inwards towards the depression.
Arrangement according to claim 2, characterised in that the cover cap (2) and the
sealing lip (15) form a component consisting of common material.
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the hinge
means is a predetermined bend site (11) which is produced by a line of weakness in

the cross-section.
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the cover cap
(2) comprises a flap part (12) which is connected to adjacent sections of the cover cap

(2) by way of seams (13,14) which are designed to tear and by inflating the gas bag
(18) the said flap part can pivot by way of the hinge means (11) out of the contour of

the cover cap (2). 
Arrangement according to claim 5 and claim 4, characterised in that the cover cap (2)
comprises a dimensionally stable basic body which is surrounded by a first synthetic

material layer (20a) which comprises the seams (13, 14) which are designed to tear
and the predetermined bend site (11) and for its part the said synthetic material layer is

covered by a second synthetic material layer (20b) which covers the seams (13, 14)
designed to tear and the predetermined bend site (11).
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the cover cap
(2) comprises in the region of the edge opposite the hinge means (11) on the lower

side attachment elements (24) which are hinged by way of sites (23) which are
designed to fracture, the said attachment elements being engaged by the holding

elements (25) of the carrier body (3).
Airbag device (1) having a carrier body (3) for a gas bag (18) which can be
influenced by an inflating device (17) and which in the inactive state is hidden below

a housing part formed as a cover cap (2), which housing part can pivot at least
partially with respect to the carrier body (3) by way of a hinge means (11),

characterised in that the cover cap (2) comprises at least one circumferential non-rigid
sealing lip (15) which clearly runs outside the inflation orifice contour of the carrier

body (3).
Airbag device (1) according to claim 8, characterised in that the airbag device (1)
comprises attachment means allocated to the carrier body (3) for attachment to or in a

vehicle instrument panel (6).
Airbag device (1) according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the airbag device (1)
is developed according to any one or several of claims 3 to 7.
