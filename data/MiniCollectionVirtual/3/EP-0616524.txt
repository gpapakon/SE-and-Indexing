This invention relates to aerosol formulations of use for the administration of medicaments by inhalation, in particular a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation which comprises particulate medicament and a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon propellant, which formulation is substantially free of surfactant and with the proviso that said medicament is other than salmeterol, salbutamol, fluticasone propionate, beclomethasone dipropionate or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. A method of treating respiratory disorders which comprises administration by inhalation of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as defined is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aerosol formulations of use for the administration of
medicaments by inhalation.The use of aerosols to administer medicaments has been known for several decades.
Such aerosols generally comprise the medicament, one or more chlorofluorocarbon
propellants and either a surfactant or a solvent, such as ethanol. The most commonly
used aerosol propellants for medicaments have been propellant 11 (CCl3F) and/or
propellant 114 (CF2ClCF2Cl) with propellant 12 (CCl2F2). However these propellants are
now believed to provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone and there is thus a need
to provide aerosol formulations for medicaments which employ so called "ozone-friendly"
propellants.A class of propellants which are believed to have minimal ozone-depleting effects in
comparison to conventional chlorofluorocarbons comprise fluorocarbons and
hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons, and a number of medicinal aerosol
formulations using such propellant systems are disclosed in, for example, EP 0372777,
WO91/04011, WO91/11173, WO91/11495 and WO91/14422. These applications are all
concerned with the preparation of pressurised aerosols for the administration of
medicaments and seek to overcome the problems associated with the use of the new class
of propellants, in particular the problems of stability associated with the pharmaceutical
formulations prepared. The applications all propose the addition of one or more of
adjuvants such as alcohols, alkanes, dimethyl ether, surfactants (including fluorinated and
non-fluorinated surfactants, carboxylic acids, polyethoxylates etc) and even conventional
chlorofluorocarbon propellants in small amounts intended to minimise potential ozone
damage.Thus, for example EP 0372777 requires the use of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in
combination with both a cosolvent having greater polarity than 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
(e.g. an alcohol or a lower alkane) and a surfactant in order to achieve a stable
formulation of a medicament powder. In particular it is noted in the specification at page 
3, line 7 that "it has been found that the use of propellant 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane)
and drug as a binary mixture or in combination with a
conventional surfactant such as sorbitan trioleate does not provide
formulations having suitable properties for use with pressurised inhalers".
Surfactants are generally recognised by those skilled in the art to be
essential components of aerosol formulations, required not only to reduce
aggregation of the medicament but also to
