<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle window with a peripheral frame (1) which engages around the glass pane (2) of the window is to be constructed in such a way that it is possible, before the pane is ultimately fixed in the frame, to perform a position compensation between these components. For this purpose, there is provision according to the invention for the leg (17), facing the body sheet, of the frame to be provided with through holes (8) through which an applied adhesive (14) can pass and thus connect the frame (1) and the glass pane (2).

pane of the window, 
characterized in that
 the arm (17) of the frame (1) towards the 
bodywork panel (12) is provided with apertures (8) through which an adhesive (14) 

applied to the arm from outside can penetrate and can join the frame (1) to the glass pane 
(2), and the arm (17) is provided at least on its side towards the glass pane (2) with a surrounding 

channel (22) which is formed in the material of the arm (17) and the entire open 
face (22a) of which can be joined to an area (21) of the glass pane of equal size by the 

adhesive (14, 26, 27, 33, 37). 
A bodywork window according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the frame (1) consists 
of a material to which a polyurethane adhesive does not adhere, such as PVC or the like. 
A bodywork window according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 a second 
channel (24) is provided on the side of the frame (1) towards the bodywork panel (12) 

opposite the first channel (22) which is likewise not interrupted by webs (6) or the like. 
A bodywork window according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 an additional 
bead (27) of a polyurethane adhesive is applied to the side of the frame (1) towards 

the bodywork panel (12), the said bead (27) forming a direct bond with the mass of polyurethane 
adhesive already present in the frame (1), 
i
.
e
. in the apertures (8) and in the 
channels (22, 24), over the entirety of the cross-section thereof during the compression in 

the course of assembly. 
A bodywork window according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 a 
movable sealing lip (25), which is arranged between the outer face of the frame (1) and 

the bodywork panel (12) and which rests with pre-stressing against the bodywork panel 
(12) in the assembled state, is arranged at the end of the web or arm (17) of the frame (1) 

on the side opposite the bead (26, 27) of adhesive. 
A bodywork window according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the sealing lip (25) 
has a length (
L
) which corresponds to approximately a third of the entire thickness (
S
) of 
the glass pane (2) and two frame thicknesses (
R
). 
A bodywork window according to one of Claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that
 a separate  
 

adhesive profile (28) is provided instead of the sealing lip (25). 
A bodywork window according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the adhesive profile 
has a square cross-section and consists of rubber sponge. 
A bodywork window according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the square adhesive 
profile (28) is detachably connected to the bead (27) of adhesive and the frame (1) on the 

face towards the bead (27) of adhesive and on the surface of the frame (1) situated at a 
right angle thereto. 
A bodywork window according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a double-sided adhesive 
tape (29, 30) is provided which forms the join on the above two faces (29, 30) with 

the bead (27) of adhesive and the frame (1).

characterized in that
 the face 
of the adhesive profile (28) is withdrawn so far towards the polyurethane face of the bead 

(27) of adhesive, or the pane (2) projects so far inside the frame (1) beyond the adhesive 
profile (28), that the largest possible area of the adhesive tape (29) is pre-stressed during 

assembly. 
A bodywork window according to one of Claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in that
 other 
profile shapes and materials are used instead of a square rubber-sponge profile. 
A bodywork window according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 a profile with the 
cross-sectional shape of an annular tube of rubber or rubber-like plastics material, preferably 

also of hard rubber, is used instead of the rubber-sponge profile. 
A bodywork window according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
, 
in order to fix the pane (2) before assembly, fastening clamps (34) are provided, which 

engage below the apertures (8) or the two channels (22, 24) into a groove (36) provided 
there on the side of the arm (17) of the frame (1) towards the pane and which engage on
