<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for separating a fine-grained solid into a fine material and a coarse material at a separating grain size below 50 mu m, preferably below approximately 10  mu m. The aim of the invention is to indicate a method and a device which, in an economical manner, make possible a clear separation in particular in the grain size range below approximately 10  mu m. To achieve this aim, the fine-grained solid is dispersed in a liquid which can form drops and the dispersion is forced into a defined sink flow with a superimposed rotation flow generated independently of the sink flow. The ratio of the speeds of the sink flow and the rotation flow determines the separating grain size. Serving as the device is a rotary-driven deflector wheel with blades running parallel to its axis of rotation and forming flow ducts, which is flowed through from the outside to the inside and to which the solid dispersion is fed at the external circumference.

Process to separate a fine-grained solid dispersed in a liquid with the capacity of
forming drops into a fine fraction and a coarse fraction whereby the coarse

material is conveyed to the periphery in a rotating flow field and the fine fraction
is conveyed to the centre in a sink flow, 
characterised in that
 the dispersion is
forced into a defined sink flow with superimposed rotational flow generated

independent of the sink flow, and the cut point between the fines and the coarse
is set by selecting the relationship between the speed of the sink flow and that

of the rotational flow, namely by altering the supply rate of the feed dispersion
on the one hand and by altering the rotational speed of the rotational flow on the

other hand.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 to generate the sink flow,
the dispersion is pumped to flow from the outside periphery to the centre of a

deflector wheel equipped with flow-channel-forming vanes which run parallel to
the wheel's rotational axis and that to generate the rotational flow, the deflector

wheel is driven to rotate.
Device to carry out the process according to Claim
1 or 2, comprising a pressure-proof housing (1) with

sockets for introducing the feed dispersion (2) and
for discharging both the fine dispersion (4) and

coarse dispersion (5), with at least one defector
wheel (3) arranged to rotate within the housing (1)

equipped with radially oriented vanes as well as a
feed pump for introducing the feed dispersion (2).
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the housing (1) is designed as a rotationally symmetrical
vessel.
Device according to Claim 3 with a cylindrical vessel,

characterised in that
 the radial distance
between the inside wall of the vessel and the

periphery of the deflector wheel is less than 10% of
the diameter of the deflector wheel.
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in
that
 the socket for the coarse dispersion (5) is
located at the centre of the bottom end of the housing

(1).
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in
that
 the socket for the feed dispersion (2) is located
at the centre of the bottom end of the housing (1).
Device according to one of the Claims 3 - 7, 
characterised
in that
 the discharge socket for the coarse
dispersion (5) is adjustable in diameter.
Device according to one of the Claims 3 - 7, 
characterised
in that
 a suction pump with adjustable flow
rate is located at the socket for the coarse dispersion

(5).
Device according to one of the Claims 3 - 7, 
characterised
in that
 the vanes (17) of the deflector wheel
(3) are radially oriented and extend from the periphery

into the area of the rotational axis of the deflector
wheel (3).
Device according to one of the Claims 3 - 7, 
characterised
in that
 the vanes (17) of the deflector wheel
(3) are radially oriented and extend from the

wheel's periphery to a shaped insert (18) which is
designed to be rotationally symmetrical and which

is arranged coaxially to the defector wheel (3).
Device according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that

the shaped insert (18) is an integral part of the hollow
drive shaft (9) of the deflector wheel (3) and, for

each of the flow channels formed by the vanes of
the deflector wheel, has at least one aperture (20)

to permit the fines to discharge.
