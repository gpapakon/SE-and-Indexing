<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a terminal connection for electrical devices, for example in the form of a plug or in the form of a test probe for the purpose of measurement, having a housing, at least one contact pin and a power supply lead, the housing (1) having a standardised base part (2) which can be connected, producing an electrical contact, to various adapter parts (for example 3) especially designed for the respective use.

Probe or measuring head for electrical test sets and/or meters, having a
casing, at least one contact pin (10) and conductors for carrying current,

the casing having a handle-type base section (2), which is provided with
various interfacing elements which are designed specifically fo
r the
respective application in order to make an electrical contact,
characterised in that
the probe or measuring head comprises interchangeable adapter
elements (3 - 6),
the various interfacing elements are arranged on the separate
adapter elements (3 - 6),
which are connectable to one end face of the base section (2) via a
quick-disconnect connector which is locatable in such a way as to

provide resistance to tensile stress, and
to that end, disposed on each adapter made up of interchangeable
adapter elements (3 - 6) are a number and arrangement of contact

pins (10) which when installed make contact with operatively
associated mating contacts in the form of sockets (20) on the base

section (2) which are arranged in the end face of the base section (2),
in addition to an adapter equipped with a test prod, at least one other
adapter with interfacing elements in the form of power plugs with

various contact configurations is connectable to the end face of the
base section (2), and
the contact pins (10) are surrounded by a projecting area (11) of the
casing (17) which is at least partly open on the front face, the

projecting area (11) is covered by the base section (2) when the
interface is in the assembled state, and at the same time the sockets

(20) engage in the front face of the projecting area (11), in the vicinity
of the open locations, and
the casing (17) of the adapter element (3), inclusive of the projecting 
area (11) and the contact pin arrangement, has a standardised design

irrespective of the particular special type of adapter element (e.g. 3),
and just one insert (8) provided on the end face of the casing (17) is

shaped in accordance with the respective requirements.
Probe or measuring head according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
sockets (20) are in the form of so-called lamellar baskets (12) which

receive the respective contact pins (19) to make the contact.
Probe or measuring head according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
projecting area (11) is constructed in one piece with the casing (17) of

the adapter element (3).
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the respective contact pin (10) incorporates a
push-fit neck (15) via which the latter is anchored to the casing (17) of

the adapter element (3), the push-fit neck (15) being connected to the
push-fit contact (9) via an electrical conductor, preferably a wire.
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the connection between the base section (2) and
the respective adapter element (e.g. 3) is via a threaded ring (7) which is

arranged either on the base section (2) or on the adapter element (3),
preferably in such a way that it cannot be lost, and so as to be able to

turn in relation thereto, and ensures a screwed connection with a thread
(8) provided on the opposite part.
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 guidance means are provided to facilitate the
connection of the base section (2) and the adapter element (3).
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the base section (2) incorporates a handle trough
(21). 
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 a control key (22) for an electronic circuit is
provided in the vicinity of the base section (2).
Probe or measuring head according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 emerging sideways from an adapter element (4)
which carries a measuring prod is a cable (27) which communicates with

interfacing elements in the inner region of the adapter element and
carries an additional pick-up on its free end.
