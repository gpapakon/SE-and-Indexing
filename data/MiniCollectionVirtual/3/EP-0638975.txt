<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sleeve end with a plurality of cable entries (9) which are split in the longitudinal direction, are of conical construction and into which conical annular seals (7, 7a) are inserted. The sleeve end (2) consists of a central part (3) and of a corresponding annular part (4), the cable entry openings (9) being arranged in the separating surface between these two parts. The separating line between the central part (3) and the annular part (4) can be designed, for example, in a polygonal shape, one cable entry opening (9) being arranged in each of the corners. In the case of this embodiment, a single cohesive sealing moulding (14) is expediently used, which surrounds the annular seals (7a) and the sealing inserts (13c) which extend between the cable entry openings (9).

Sleeve head (2) having a plurality of cable 
inlets, which are split in the longitudinal direction and 

have annular seals (7, 7a) made from an elastic material 
in the inlet openings (9), and having pressure means (5, 

16), characterized in that it (2) comprises a central 
part (3) and a corresponding annular part (4), in that 

the cable inlet openings (9) are arranged in the parting 
surface between the central part (3) and the annular part 

(4) in such a way that in each case the first halves of 
the cable inlet openings (9) are cut out in the central 

part (3) and the corresponding second halves are cut out 
in the annular part (4), the walls of the cable inlet 

openings (9) converging conically, in that use is made in 
the assembled state of conical annular seals (7, 7a) 

fitted in the cable inlet openings (9), and in that seal 
inserts (13) are arranged in the parting regions (10) 

between the cable inlet openings (9), and in that the 
annular seals (7, 7a) can be axially pressed by the 

pressure means (5, 16).

part (14).  

 
Sleeve head according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the annular seals (7) have lateral 

projections (13, 13a) which, starting from the cable 
inlet openings (9), extend in the parting regions (10) 

between the cable inlet openings (9) and produce the 
connection between the individual annular seals. 
Sleeve head according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the projections (13) extend over the entire 

length of the cable inlet opening (9).

claims, characterized in that a pressure plate (5) is 

arranged which covers the central part (3) and annular 
part (4) and on which projections (8) which dip in at the 

locations of the cable inlet openings (9) are integrally 
formed in the form of bushings. 
Sleeve head according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that a separate pressure device (16) is 

arranged for each cable inlet opening (9). 
Sleeve head according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the pressure plate (5) is split in accordance 

with the shape of the split of the central part (3) and 
annular part (4). 
Sleeve head according to Claim 11, characterized 
in that each pressure device (16) is split transversely 

over the cable inlet opening (9).
