<ABSTRACT>
An injection moulding machine has a machine foot (10), a stationary platen (11) and a movable platen (12) and also a supporting element (13) which bears a closing mechanism (S) and is movably connected to the stationary platen via at least one force transmission element, which essentially absorbs the forces occurring when the mould is closed. Due to the fact that the force transmission element is designed as a separate deformation element (yoke 14), which can be deformed by the stresses, and that the supporting element (13) is mounted on the machine foot (10) movably in the closing direction, the effect is achieved that the deformations occurring during the closing operation are diverted away to a great extent without any effect on the machine foot, without impairing mould parallelism.

Injection moulding machine with a machine base
(10), a stationary mould carrier (11) securely

connected to the machine base or a part of same, and a
movable mould carrier (12), as well as with a

supporting element (13) bearing a closing mechanism (S)
for the movement of the movable mould carrier (12),

said supporting element being hinged to the stationary
mould carrier (11) via at least one force transmitting

element, which substantially takes up the forces
occurring when the mould (31) is closed, as well as

with a motion path for the movable mould carrier (12),
characterised in that the force transmitting element is

configured as a deforming element (14), deformable by
the forces, in that the supporting element (13) is

mounted on the machine base (10) by means of a guiding
device (15, 21, 22) so as to be movable in a straight

line in the closing direction, joint parts (16, 17, 18;
27) for the hinged connection being detachably arranged

on the supporting element (13) or stationary mould
carrier (11) and on the deforming element (14).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that studs (17, 18) are detachably

fastened with screws (25) to the supporting element
(13) and the stationary mould carrier (11) and form

joints with pillow blocks (27) detachably fastened by 
means of screws (26) to the deforming element

configured as a shackle (14).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 2,
characterised in that the stud (17, 18) is mounted in

recesses (11a,13a,14a) of the shackle (14) and of the
stationary mould carrier (11) or of the supporting

element (13) and is penetrated by further bearing pins
(19) standing vertical to the stud axis and plunging

into bore holes (11b,13b,14b) of the shackle (14) and
stationary mould carrier (11) or supporting element

(13).
Injection moulding machine according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the distance

between the stationary (11) mould carrier and the
movable mould carrier (12) may be altered by washer

pieces (75), which may be inserted between joint parts
and the stationary mould carrier (11) supporting

element (13) and/or deforming element.
Injection moulding machine according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the closing

mechanism is a toggle mechanism (Y) and in that a
joining element (55) is suspended in an articulated

manner via two holding elements (37, 38) linked to link
points (35, 36) of the toggle mechanism (Y) on the

movable mould carrier (12) and on the supporting 
element (13'), and the driving unit (A) is fastened to

said joining element (55).
Injection moulding machine according to claim 5,
characterised in that that the driving device is

configured as a quill drive (H) in which a ball rolling
spindle (41) configured as the driving element is

mounted and may be at least partially received.
Injection moulding machine according to claim 5 or
6, characterised in that the shackle (14) carries the

supporting element (13') at the machine base (10) in
the area of the neutral fibres of the shackle (14), so

as to be movable in the closing direction (s-s), via
bearing elements (46) which are disposed in a plane (v-v)

which is perpendicular to the closing direction and
passes approximately through the link point (35) of the

toggle mechanism (Y).
