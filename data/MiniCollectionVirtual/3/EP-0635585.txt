<ABSTRACT>
Process for the surface metallisation of a sintered aluminium nitride article with a metal layer which is made very thick and adherent to the said surface, the process including three stages wherein the first consists in irradiating the surface to be metallised by means of an excimer laser beam emitting in the ultraviolet, the second in immersing the irradiated article in an autocatalytic bath containing metal ions and inducing the formation of a metal layer formed by these ions on the parts of the surface which has been irradiated beforehand, and the last one in heat-treating the article thus metallised, in accordance with a very short heating regime and at moderate temperature, inducing the diffusion of a fraction of the atoms from the metal layer into the article thus treated, and any metallised product obtained in accordance with the same process.

Process for metallizing the surface of a sintered 
aluminium nitr
ide (AIN) part by means of a metallic layer which has a 
thickness greater than 50 micrometers and adheres to this surface, 

characterized in that it comprises successively irradiating the surface of 
the part to be metallized with the light beam emitted by an excimer laser 

having a wave length comprised between 190 and 350 nanometers and 
an energy density of 300 to 800 mJ/cm
2
 so as to form a weakly adhering 
metallic aluminium layer thereon, immersing the irradiated part in an 

electro-catalytic bath without polarisation, so-called auto-catalytic, 
containing metal ions to enable these ions to be deposited selectively 

onto the surface of the part coated with the weakly adhering aluminium 
layer and subjecting the side of the part which does not contain said 

metallic aluminium layer and which is situated opposite the irradiated 
surface to a heat treatment at a temperature of 400 to 500Â°C for periods 

of time comprised between 15 and 30 seconds to achieve a diffusion of 
metal in the AIN part and to form in this way the adhering metallic layer 

of more than 50 micrometers. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
auto-catalytic bath contains metal ions chosen within the group 

comprising copper, nickel, zinc, iron and molybdenum. 
Process according to either one of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that after being immersed in the auto-catalytic bath, the 

part is immersed in an electrolytic bath with polarisation either of the 
same metal as the one deposited by auto-catalysis or not. 
Process according to either one of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the metal ions deposited by auto-catalysis form a 

layer with a thickness comprised between 50 and 250 micrometers.  
 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that a 
metallic layer of 5 micrometers is first deposited auto-catalytically, 

subsequently another metallic layer having a thickness comprised 
between 50 and 250 micrometers is deposited electrolytically, the two 

layers being formed by the same or different metals.
