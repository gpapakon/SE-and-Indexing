Printing machine spraying device with at least two 
emitters (2, 4) for spraying fluid onto a surface 

moved in the longitudinal direction of the machine or 
rotating around a machine transverse axis in the 

printing machine, with an automatic movement device 
(28, 30) for the emitters (2, 4), which moves these 

emitters (2, 4) under automatic control transversely 
to the longitudinal direction of the machine across 

the surface at a distance from this surface, while the 
surface moves in the longitudinal direction of the 

machine or rotates around a machine transverse axis, 
start positions situated at a distance from one 

another being assigned to a first (2) and a second (2) 
of the emitters respectively at the beginning of the 

spraying process in the transverse direction of the 
machine, characterized in that the first emitter (2) 

and the second emitter (4) starting out from their 
start positions roughly with the commencement of 

spraying are movable in the transverse direction of 
the machine first towards one another, then past one 

another, and finally away from one another, and that 
an automatic metering device (50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 58, 

59, 60) is provided, which meters the fluid sprayed by 
the first and second emitters (2, 4) to a defined 

quantity, the metering device (50, 51, 52, 54, 56, 58, 
59, 60) containing storage lines (50) for storing the 

metered amount of fluid, which lines are connected by 
their downstream ends flow-wise to the relevant 

emitters (2, 4), so that only the quantity of fluid 
metered in the storage lines (50) is sprayed by the 

emitters (2, 4) in each case. 
Printing machine spraying device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the first emitter (2) is movable 

in the transverse direction of the machine as far as  
 

the start position of the second emitter (4) and vice-versa. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the start 

positions of the emitters (2, 4) in the transverse 
direction of the machine lie at width positions at 

which approximately the longitudinal edges of the 
surface to be sprayed also lie. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the start 

positions of the emitters (2, 4) are changeable under 
power control in the transverse direction of the 

machine. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

spraying cone (32) of at least one of the emitters 
(2, 4) is moved during the movement in the transverse 

direction of the machine across the entire width to be 
dampened (36, 38) of the surface to be dampened and 

the emitter sprays fluid during this overall movement 
in the transverse direction of the machine. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

storage lines (50) for storing the metered quantity of 
fluid are connectable at their upstream end optionally 

to a fluid source (60) for introducing the metered 
quantity of fluid into the storage line (50) or to a 

compressed air source (59) for expelling the metered 
quantity of fluid from the storage line and the 

emitter. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that at least  

 
one of the emitters (2, 4) is disposed respectively on 

each side of a substrate (12) and is directed at the 
surfaces of this substra
te (12) and/or a cylinder 
(22, 26) of a printing unit (7) and/or at a roller of 

a dampening unit (24) and/or a roller of an inking 
unit (20). 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

movements of the emitters in the transverse direction 
of the machine and the spraying of the fluid from the 

emitters (2, 4) are controlled automatically by a 
control device (56) depending on control signals and 

parameters of the printing machine. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

emitters (2, 4) are each moved basically parallel to 
rotation axes of cylinders (22, 26) of a printing unit 

(7) of the printing machine in the transverse 
direction of the machine. 
Printing machine spraying device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that at least 

one of the emitters (2, 4) has a 2- or several-component 
nozzle, which has a nozzle outlet (86) and 

at least two fluid inlets (80, 81, 82) connected or 
connectable flow-wise to the nozzle outlet.
