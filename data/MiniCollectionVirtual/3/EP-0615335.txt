<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switch mode
electrical power controller.Switch mode electrical power controllers are used
in electrical power supplies. An electrical power supply
for an electrical system including active semiconductor
or vacuum devices is usually required to provide a substantially
constant output voltage from a rectified alternating
voltage while an electrical power supply for an electrical
motor may be required to provide a variable output voltage
for the control of the motor speed. Thus the controller
for an electrical power supply may be required to provide for
either the generation of a stabilised output voltage or a
variable output voltage from an unstabilised input voltage.An electrical power supply employing a switch mode
controller operates by chopping the input voltage, passing
to its output port either the full input voltage or zero
voltage. The periods with a non-zero output voltage alternate
with those of zero output voltage and the ratio of the
two periods is varied as required to make the long term
average voltage equal to the desired output voltage.One of the advantages of a switch mode electrical
power supply over other forms of electrical power supply
is that the operating frequency may, within limits, be
selected, and the fact that the energy storage components
become smaller as the operating frequency is increased 
permits some control over the size of the power supply.German Patent Application No.32 27 296 discloses a
pulse width modulator (PWM) circuit for a switching
regulator in which the PWM circuit includes a first
comparator which compares an input signal with a sawtooth
wave signal, a second comparator which compares a
reference voltage with the sawtooth wave signal, an AND
circuit which receives the outputs from the first and
second comparators and a reference voltage generator
which includes series-connected first and second
resistors; a capacitor is connected in parallel with one
of the resistors and the reference voltage is obtained
from the connection point between the resistors, a
preferred arrangement including, further, a switch
circuit so connected to the resistors that the reference
voltage may be lowered by an electrical signal applied to
the switch circuit.United States Patent Application No. 3 978 424

first triangular signal generator in the form of a
closed-loop oscillator, a second triangular signal
generator for generating a signal which is inverted with
respect to the first triangular
