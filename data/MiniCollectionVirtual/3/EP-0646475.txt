<ABSTRACT>
A binder formulation for improving the water resistance, 
especially the warm water resistance, of thermally-sensitive 

record material comprises a major proportion of 
an amide ammonium salt of a substantially non-esterified 

styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer and a minor proportion 
of polyvinyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermally-sensitive record 
material. Thermally-sensitive record material is widely used in 
facsimile (telecopier) machines, labels, tickets, charts 
for recording the output of medical or scientific 
monitoring equipment and for the output of calculators, 
adding machines, small computer printers and suchlike. 
In its most common form, the record material comprises a 
support carrying a coating of a thermally sensitive 
composition of which the image-forming components are one 
or more initially colourless or light-coloured electron-donating 
chromogenic materials (or colour formers) and 
one or more electron-accepting coreactants (or colour 
developers) capable of reacting with the chromogenic 
material to develop its colour. The electron-donating 
chromogenic material is normally a fluoran or other 
leucodye and the electron-accepting coreactant is 
normally an organic acid, most commonly a bisphenol. The chromogenic material and the coreactant are normally 
each present in finely-divided particulate form and are 
dispersed in a suitable matrix material, for example 
polyvinyl alcohol, which also serves as a binder. The 
thermally-sensitive composition usually also contains a 
variety of other ingredients such as sensitizers or 
modifiers for enhancing the thermal response of the 
composition, fillers or pigments, lubricants, whiteners, 
image-stabilizers, and wetting aids. The support is normally of paper, although plastic film 
is used for certain products, such as transparencies. 
The support can if desired be precoated, for example with 
a pigment/binder composition.  
 In their initial solid state, the chromogenic material 
and the coreactant do not react together. On selective 
imagewise application of heat by means of a thermal 
printer or stylus, local melting of one or more of the 
components of the thermally-sensitive composition occurs. 
The liquid phase thus created facilitates reaction 
between the chromogenic material and the coreactant, 
thereby developing the colour of the chromogenic material 
in a pattern corresponding to that of the heat energy 
input, and so producing an image. All of the foregoing is very well known and is the 
subject of an extensive patent literature, and so needs 
no further description. Thermally-sensitive record material for certain end uses 
is required to be resistant to moisture. In particular, 
it must not rub off when wet, and must still be capable 
of being imaged after exposure to moisture, whether or 
not it has fully

Thermally-sensitive record material comprising a 
support and a thermally-sensitive composition coated 

on the support, the thermally-sensitive composition 
including as image forming components an electron 

donating chromogenic material and complementary 
electron accepting coreactant material effective to 

develop the colour of the chromogenic material when 
heat is applied to the composition, said image 

forming components being dispersed in a 
thermographically acceptable binder formulation, 

characterized in that the binder formulation 
comprises a major proportion of an amide ammonium 

salt of a substantially non-esterified 
styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer and a minor 

proportion of polyvinyl alcohol. 
The use, for the purpose of improving the water 
resistance, particularly the warm water resistance, 

of thermally sensitive record material including as 
image-forming components an electron donating 

chromogenic material and complementary electron 
accepting coreactant material effective to develop 

the colour of the chromogenic material when heat is 
applied to the composition, of a binder formulation 

for said components comprising a major proportion of 
an amide ammonium salt of a substantially non-esterified 

styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer and a 
minor proportion of polyvinyl alcohol.
