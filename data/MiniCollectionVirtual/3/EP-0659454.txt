<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski equipped with a (running) sole provided with discontinuous striations (50, 60), which comprises a smooth or barely structured front part (5) and a highly structured rear part (6). The rear part (6) extends towards the rear in the direction of the rear contact line (11), from a transverse line (12) located between the midline (13) of the boot and a transverse line located at a distance (d) from the midline (13) of the boot, equal to 0.4 times the distance (D) separating the said line (13) from the front contact line (10). The invention relates more particularly to an alpine (downhill) ski, the ability of which in terms of gliding is thereby improved.

Ski for moving over snow comprising a lower gliding 
surface (1) made of a plastic material, provided with a 

plurality of discontinuous serrations (50, 60); said surface 
resting on a front contact line (10) and a rear contact line 

(11) when the ski does not carry a load, characterized in that 
the surface (1) comprises a front portion (5) that is smooth 

or lightly structured and a strongly structured rear portion 
(6) whose measured roughness parameter value Rtm is greate
r 
than the value measured in the front portion; said rear 

portion (6) extending towards the rear of the ski in the 
direction of the rear contact line (11); from a transverse 

line (12) located between the boot center line (13) and a 
transverse line located at a distance (d) from the boot 

center line (13) equal to 0.4 times the distance (D) 
separating said line (13) from the front contact line (10). 
Ski according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
measured Rtm value is less than or equal to 15 µm in the front 

portion (5) and is greater than 15 µm in the rear portion (6) 
of the gliding surface (1). 
Ski according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the strongly structured rear portion (6) of the gliding 

surface (1) extends rearwardly, at least up to the rear 
contact line (11) of said surface. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the rear portion (6) subject to the 

pronounced structuring starts from a line (12) located at a 
distance (d) comprised between 0.2 and 0.4 times the distance 

(D) separating the boot center line (13) from the front 
contact line (10).  

 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the rear portion (6) has such a 

structuring that the roughness value Rtm is greater than 15 µm 
over a central zone (600) having a width (l1) only from the 

width (L) of the lower surface (1); said rear portion 
comprising on both sides of said central zone (600), edges 

(61, 62) of width (l2) that are smooth or lightly structured 
and whose measured roughness value Rtm is less than 15 µm and 

the roughness value Rku 
<
 3. 
Ski according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
width (12) of the edges (61, 62) is comprised between 0.03 L 

and 0,3 L; it being understood that the width (l1) of the 
central zone (60) is greater than or equal to 0.45 L. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the rear portion (6) is of a width (l1) 

that is constant along the lower surface (1). 
Ski according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
structuring of the rear portion (6) is obtained by passing a 

heated and pressurized tool (8) over the lower surface (1); 
said tool (8) having the shape of a roller comprising a raised 

design of a constant edge width (1) on the surface of which a 
plurality of discontinuous ribs (80) are formed. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the strongly structured rear portion (6) 

comprises a plurality of short, rectilinear and discontinuous 
serrations (60), arranged in separate or meshed rows.  

 
Ski according to claim 9, characterized in that a 
majority, at least, of the serrations (60) are oriented along 

the longitudinal axis of the ski. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the structuring of the rear portion (6) 

at least has such a roughness gradient that the measured Rtm 
value and the measured Rku value decrease progressively, from 

the rear contact line (11) in the direction of the front 
contact line (10). 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the structuring of the rear portion (6) 

has such a roughness gradient, along the width (L) of the 
lower surface, that the measured Rtm and Rku values increase 

progressively from the lateral running edges (4) towards the 
longitudinal axis, at least over a significant portion of the 

width of the lower surface; it being understood that the 
roughness (Rtm, Rku) can remain substantially constant over 

small width portions. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the gliding surface (1) is constituted 

by a coating having the same chemical properties and the same 
hardness over the entire length of the ski.
