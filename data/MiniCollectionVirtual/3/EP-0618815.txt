Use of monoclonal antibodies against type I phospholipase 
A₂ which, at a concentration of less than 

100 ng/ml, brings about an at least 50% inhibition of 
the activity of phospholipase A₂ or of a functional 

fragment of this antibody for the preparation of a 
therapeutic which can be used in the case of inflammatory 

phenomena, especially in the case of acute pancreatitis. 
Pharmaceutical formulation consisting of a monoclonal 
antibody against type I phospholipase A₂ which, at a 

concentration of less than 100 ng/ml, brings about an at 
least 50% inhibition of the activity of phospholipase A₂ 

or of a functional fragment of this antibody, together 
with the usual pharmaceutical carrier, filling, adjuvant 

and additive materials. 
Monoclonal antibody against type I phospholipase A₂ 
which, at a concentration of less than 100 ng/ml, brings 

about an at least 50% inhibition of the activity of 
phospholipase A₂ and which, in equivalent manner, is 

bindable to type I phospholipase A₂ like a monoclonal 
antibody obtainable from the cell lines DSM ACC2026 

and/or DSM ACC2025. 
Monoclonal antibody against type I phospholipase A₂ 
which, at a concentration of less than 100 ng/ml, brings 

about an at least 50% inhibition of the activity of 
phospholipase A₂ and is obtainable from the cell lines 

DSM ACC2026 or DSM ACC2025. 
Cell line DSM ACC2026. 
Cell line DSM ACC2025.
