<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention it is characterised in that it includes:     - a first sheet carded from fibres of curled heat-fusible materials of fine titre, - a second sheet by direct spinning from straight filaments of extruded heat-fusible material, - multiple welding points produced vertically through the two sheets to consolidate each of the sheets and to bond them on a part of their area of contact, - multiple unwelded regions from which the curled material emerges,   to increase the feeling of softness and of textile feel of the product. Application in the field of the manufacture of nonwoven products as a component of hygiene articles and hospital and medical products.

Composite non-woven fabric for medical and hygiene articles, 
constituted of at least two sheets, namely a first sheet of fine-count heat-fusible 

fibers and a second sheet of continuous filaments of extruded heat-fusible 
material, characterized in that the first sheet (1) is a carded sheet of crimped fibers 

(8) and in that said non-woven fabric comprises multiple weld points (11) 
produced vertically through said two sheets in order both to consolidate each of the 

two sheets (1, 2) and to bond them together over a fraction of their contracting 
areas, so that the crimped material (8) emerges from
 the multiple non-welded 
points. 
Non-woven fabric according to claim 1, characterized in that the first 
carded sheet of crimp fibers is outside the non-woven fabric. 
Non-woven fabric according to claim 1, characterized in that the print 
of the welding points penetrates throughout the height of the first carded sheet. 
Non-woven fabric according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the crimped fibers of the first carded sheet are polypropylene fibers of count 

comprised between 1.5 and 6 dtex and cut to a length of 35 to 60 mm. 
Method of manufacturing a composite non-woven fabric for medical 
and hygiene articles having a soft textile feel and isotropic mechanical strength, 

constituted of at least two sheets, characterized in that: 

two non-consolidated sheets of heat fusible materials are made 
simultaneously, the first sheet (1) by carding fine-count crimped fibers, and the 

second sheet (2) by direct spinning continuous filaments that are extruded and 
made up into a sheet in aerodynamic manner, 
two non-consolidated sheets are superposed, 
the two sheets superposed in this manner are subjected to a single hot 
calendering operation under pressure in multiple weld points, thereby 

simultaneously consolidating each of the sheets and also bonding the two sheets 
together over a fraction of their contracting surface, by melting the thermo-fusible 

material from which the crimped fibers and the continuous filaments are made in 
the multiple weld points. 
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that the calendering 
temperature is determined so as to lie between the melting temperatures of the 

crimped fibers and of the continuous filaments. 
Method according to one of claims 5 or 6, characterized in that it 
includes 20 to 100 weld points per square centimeter.
