<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (1) can be connected detachably to a stationary connector (13 or 21). The stationary connector is in this case a constituent part of a measurement device for measuring different optical waveguides. The adapter is provided with a circuit (3) into which different mobile connectors can be inserted for a short time. The circuit has a slot (6), parallel to the axis, for receiving an anti-rotation element (locking element, rotation protection device) on a first category of stationary connectors (21). In addition, the circuit has, however, on its outer casing also at least one further recess (4, 4', 5) for receiving the anti-rotation element (19, 19', 20) at a second category of stationary connectors (13). In this way, an interface is produced between the adapter (1) and the stationary connector (13, 21), which interface makes an adapter, equipped in this manner, combinable with different connectors but where, on the other hand, an adapter without additional recess can be placed only on one of the two categories.

<CLAIMS>
Optical plug connection between an adapter (1) and
selectively a first or second category of plug

portions (13, 21), said plug portions possessing a
plug ferrule (14, 22) held within a plug casing (16,

24) as well as a rotational security device coordinated
with a sleeve (3) on the adapter in such a

way that said rotational security device permits a
connection only when in the correct position between

plug portion and sleeve,

wherein the rotational security device of the first
category of plug portions (21) possesses a pin (26)

arranged transversely in the plug casing (24), said
pin co-ordinating with an axis-parallel slot (6) or

with an axis-parellel groove in the sleeve (3),
and wherein the rotational security device of the
second category of plug portions (13) possesses at

least two guide elements (19, 19', 20) arranged at an
irregular angular distribution on the plug casing

(16) and aligned towards the plug ferrule (14), said
elements co-ordinating with at least two axis-parallel

recesses (4, 4', 5) on the outer jacket of
the sleeve.
Optical plug connection between an adapter (1) and a

plug portion (13) wherein the adapter is connected
with the plug portion to be able to be released and

wherein the plug portion possesses a plug ferrule
(14) said plug ferrule being surrounded by the plug

casing (16) as well as a rotational security device
co-ordinating with a sleeve (3) on the adapter (1) 

and permitting a connection between plug portion (13)
and sleeve (3) only when in the correct position,

characterized in that at least two axis-parallel
recesses (4, 4', 5) are arranged on the outer jacket

of the sleeve (3) at an irregular angular
distribution, said recesses co-ordinating with at

least two corresponding guide elements (19, 19', 20)
on the plug casing (16).
Optical plug connection according to claim 2,
characterized in that the guide elements are

connected with the plug casing as one piece.
Optical plug connection according to claim 3,
characterized in that the guide elements are arranged

on the face (17) of the plug casing (16).
Optical plug connection according to one of the
claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the sleeve (3)

possesses three recesses (4, 4', 5) wherein, in
relation to a plane of symmetry passing through the

axis of the sleeve, a U-shaped groove (5) is arranged
to lie within the plane of symmetry and,

diametrically opposite, two L-shaped grooves are
arranged on both sides of and at a distance from said

plane of symmetry.
Optical plug connection according to claim 5,
characterized in that the guide elements on the plug

portion (13) are formed as two segments of a circle
(19, 19') to fit the L-shaped grooves and as a lug

(20) to fit the U-shaped groove. 
Optical plug connection according to one of the
claims 2 to 6, characterized in that, in addition to

the recesses (4, 4', 5), the sleeve (3) possesses an
axis-parallel slot (6) so that the adapter (1) can

also be connected with a plug portion (21) of an
alternative category, the rotational security

device of which co-ordinates exclusively with said
slot (6).
Optical plug connection according to one of the
claims 2 to 7, characterized in that the plug portion

(13) possesses a plug ferrule (14), the face (15) of
which is provided with an inclination for attaining

a high return loss at the outlet of the optical
fiber.
