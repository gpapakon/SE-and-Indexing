<ABSTRACT>
The contact socket is used for the connection of mating contacts, especially in the form of flat contact tongues. It comprises a contact spring support (1), which comprises at least one supporting wall (2' or 3') on whose inside a row of domed contact springs (4') is arranged. In this case, at least one end (6') of each contact spring (4) is bent round on the outside of the supporting wall (2', 3'). These contact springs expand elastically, to make contact, when a mating contact is inserted. Particularly economical manufacture is provided in that the contact springs (43') are designed integrally with the supporting wall (2', 3'), in each case being bent back onto it, adjacent to it, and the respective free end (8') of the contact springs (4') being bent back around the corresponding supporting wall edge (10'). Each supporting wall (2', 3') is stamped from a metal sheet (33), together with the associated contact springs (4'). The thickness of the metal sheet (33) can in this case be stepped.

<CLAIMS>
Socket for the connection of mating contacts, 
particularly in the form of flat contact tabs, having 

a contact spring carrier (1) comprising at least one 
carrying wall (2' and/or 3'), disposed on the inside 

of which is a row of curved contact springs (4') 
which, upon introduction of a mating contact, 

resiliently expand while making contact, one end (6') 
of each contact spring (4) being bent round against 

the outside of the carrying wall (2', 3'),
 
characterized in that the contact springs (43') are 

integrally constructed with the carrying wall (2', 
3'), being in each case bent back adjacent to said 

wall, and the respective free end (6') of the contact 
springs (4') is bent back around the appropriate 

carrying wall edge (10'). 
Socket according to claim 1, characterized in that 
each carrying wall (2', 3') together with the 

associated contact springs (4') is punched from a 
metal sheet (33). 
Socket according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
metal sheet (33) has a graded strength.
