<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of treating a viral infection in a mammal comprising administering an effective amount of modified C-reactive protein (CRP) to the mammal. In particular, modified-CRP has been found to be effective and safe for treating retroviral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus 1. The invention also provides a method of neutralizing a virus comprising contacting the virus with modified-CRP. In particular, modified-CRP can be used to neutralize viruses in blood which is to be used for transfusions by adding the modified-CRP to the blood prior to the transfusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to treating viral
infections with modified C-reactive protein and to
neutralizing viruses with modified C-reactive protein.Since the advent of AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome), the need for effective
treatments for viral infections has become urgent.
AIDS is caused by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1).
The initial pathogenic event is the binding of
HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor on a subset of T cells and
monocyte-macrophages. Fauci et al., Ann. Intern. Med.,
114, 678-693 (1991) (summary of a National Institutes
of Health Conference). The virus interacts with the
human immune system, and the ultimate consequence of
this interaction is a profound immunosuppression
resulting from the quantitative depletion and
functional abnormalities of the CD4 T-cell subset. Id.
Mononuclear phagocytes may play a role in the
pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection by serving as
reservoirs of the virus. Id. Of note is the fact that
monocytes in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected
individuals are rarely infected in vivo, whereas 
infected tissue macrophages may play a role in organ-specific
HIV-1-related pathogenesis. Id.One drug that has been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AIDS
is 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxy-thymidine (zidovudine,
azidothymidine, AZT) which inhibits HIV-1 replication
by acting at the level of reverse transcriptase.
However, AZT causes serious side effects, such as bone
marrow suppression, and it is poorly tolerated in a
high proportion of patients. Yarchoan et al., Immunol.
Today, 11, 327-33 (1990). Also, the beneficial effects
of AZT have been reported to abate in 12-18 months.
Chase, "Doctors and Patients Hope AZT Will Help Stave
Off AIDS," Wall Street Journal, April 28, 1988, page
14, col. 1.The FDA has also approved 2',3'-dideoxyinosine
(DDI) for the treatment of AIDS in
patients who cannot tolerate AZT or for whom AZT is no
longer effective. DDI has been found efficacious and
safe in the short term, but its long term effects are
not yet known. Chem. Eng. News, Oct. 14, 1991, at 17.Another drug for the treatment of AIDS is
ampligen. Ampligen is a mispaired double-stranded RNA.
It increases antiviral activity by stimulating
interferon production, activating natural killer cells,
and augmenting an internal cellular antiviral
mechanism. Montefiori et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.
U.S.A., 84, 2985-89 (1987) and Dagani, Chem. Eng. News,
Nov. 23, 1987, at 41-49.Other possible therapeutic approaches for the
treatment of AIDS are discussed in
