<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve long valve opening times in rotary slide valves for piston-driven internal combustion engines, a shaft (6) bearing the valve passage (7) rotates at half the speed of rotation of the chrankshaft of the engine. The passage (7) is so inclined with respect to the shaft axis (16) that the valve outlets do not overlap, when seen in projection. The angular area  alpha  covered by the valve outlets and the angular area  beta  covered by the bore (12) in the cylinder head (2) define together an angular area of about 90 DEG . The shaft (6) is not only supported on both sides of the outlets, but also sealingly supported in the cylinder head (2) between the outlets.

<CLAIMS>
A rotary slidevalve in a piston-driven combustion engine, which
exhibits in the cylinderhead (2) a shaft (6, 8) which is supported to

be able to turn and is provided with a passage (7, 23) which penetrates
the shaft (6, 8) and during the turning of the shaft (6, 8) produces in

one range of the rotation a connection between a channel (10, 13) running
in the cylinderhead (2) and a bore (12, 14) in the cylinderhead (2) leading

to the cylinder, whilst an opening (18) from the passage as it wipes
past the drilled hole (12, 14) occupies at any time a sector (a) referred

to the axis (16) of the shaft, greater than the angle (β) made by the
bore (12, 14), the passage (7, 23) and the bore (12, 14) are formed as

slots in the direction of the axis (16) of the shaft, the walls of the
passage (7, 23) taper in to the middle with the minimum cross-section of

passage not less than the cross-section of passage of the bore (12, 14),
and the shaft (6, 8) on both sides of and between the openings (18, 20)

from the passage is supported in the cylinderhead (2) with a seal along
and across the axis (16) of the shaft, 
characterized in that

the combustion engine is a fourstroke combustion engine, the passage (7,
23) runs at an angle to the axis (16) of the shaft and the one opening

(18) from the passage is hereby offset in the direction of the axis (16)
of the shaft from the opposite opening (20) from the passage in such a

way that during one full revolution of the shaft a connection arises
between the channel (10, 13) and the drilled hole (12, 14) only once, the

shaft (6, 8) turns at half the r.p.m. of the engine crankshaft, the opening
(18) from the passage which wipes past the hole (12, 14) together

with the region of the hole (12, 14) adjoining the shaft (6, 8) includes
a sector (α plus β) which amounts to more than 90°, the passage (7, 23)

and the bore (12, 14) are made wedge-shaped, running in the same direction
of the axis (16) of the shaft, and the shaft (6, 8) is able to shift

in the direction of the axis (16) of the shaft.
A rotary slidevalve as in Claim 1, characterized in that
the shaft (6, 8) consists of a ceramic material.
A rotary slidevalve as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the bearing of the shaft consists of a ceramic material.
