<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filter holder comprising a dish (1) intended to be mounted on a coffee machine of the espresso type and having a bowl (2) whose bottom wall has a filtering surface (3) and which is intended to receive a quantity of coffee which can be of various grounds. The said dish (1) also comprises a froth collection chamber (4) situated under the said filtering surface (3) and communicating via an outlet passage (5) with distribution funnels (6) which allow the infusion to run off. According to the invention, the filter holder comprises means for partial closure (9) of the filtering surface (3) of the bottom of the bowl (2).

Filter holder having a dish (1) designed to be mounted on a 
coffee machine of the "espresso" type and having a cup (2) 

whose bottom wall forms a filtering surface (3) and which is 
designed to receive a quantity of coffee, the fineness of whose 

grounds may vary, and liquid under pressure, said dish also 
having a collection chamber for froth (4) provided between its 

bottom (10) and said filtering surface (3), and communicating 
via an exit passage (5) with distribution funnels (6) enabling 

the infusion to flow out of said dish (1), and blocking means 
located under the bottom wall of the cup (2), characterized in 

that said blocking means partially block said filtering surface 
(3) with a predetermined degree of blocking in order to 

regulate the pressure of the liquid in the cup as a function of 
the degrees of fineness of the grounds. 
Filter holder according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the blocking means are formed by at least one blocking area (9) 

arranged in the bottom (10) of the dish (1) and distant from 
said bottom (10) at a certain level (
A
), and the cup (2) is 
mounted so as to be able to move in height so as to occupy at 

least two positions, either a blocking position in which a part 
of the filtering surface (3) is brought adjacent to the level 
A
 
of the blocking area (9), or an outflow position in which the 

filtering surface (3) is situated at a distance from said 
blocking area. 
Filter holder according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the filtering surface (3) of the bottom wall of the cup (2) has 

perforated zones (7) and non-perforated zones (8). 
Filter holder according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the blocking means are formed by blocking areas (9) carried by 

bosses arranged in the bottom (10) of the dish (1) and situated 
at a distance from said bottom (10) at a certain level (
A
), 
said cup (2) having its bottom wall adjacent to the level (
A
) 
of said blocking areas and being mounted so as to move in 

rotation about a vertical axis (X-Y) so as to occupy different  
 

positions in the dish (1) corresponding to different degrees of 
covering of the perforated zones (7) by the blocking area (9). 
Filter holder according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in 
that the perforated zones (7) and the non-perforated zones (8) 

forming the filtering surface (3) of the cup (2) are arranged 
as alternating sectors. 
Filter holder according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the cup (2) has at least one perforated safety zone (12) which 

can never be blocked by the blocking areas (9), whatever the 
position of the cup (2) in the dish (1). 
Filter holder according to clam 3, characterized in that the 
blocking means are formed in a plate (13), mounted so as to 

move in rotation about the vertical axis (X-Y) of the cup (2), 
and having a partially perforated surface (14). 
Filter holder according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the plate (13) has a handle (17) which projects between the 

respective upper edges of the dish (1) and of the cup (2) and 
the surface (14) has shutters consisting of perforated areas 

(15) arranged in sectors and alternating with solid areas (16).
