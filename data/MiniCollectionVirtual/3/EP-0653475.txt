<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an emulsion composition for a flameproof foam sheet.
More particularly, the invention relates to an emulsion composition for a flameproof
foam sheet which comprises an ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer, a thermal expansive
hollow micro bead and an inorganic filler.Hitherto, emulsion compositions for flameproof foam sheets used for wall paper
have maintained their flame resistances with the aid of vinyl chloride-containing
copolymers as polymer components.However, a wall paper which contains a vinyl chloride-containing copolymer
has a problem, from a view point of global environment and work environment, in that
it generates poisonous chlorine gas at the time of disposal by burning.JP-A-53014738 discloses foaming, fireproofing resin coating
composition containing (a) phosphate compound,
(b) carbonaceous material, and (c) resin emulsion.JP-A-63308078 discloses acrylic emulsion waterproofing
coating material comprising plasticiser, pigment,
dispersing agent, anti-foaming agent, and inorganic fine
powder.The components (A)-(C) with the specific parameters as
disclosed by the present invention, and, likewise, the
problem of poisonous chlorine gas generation are not
described by either JP-prior art documents.Consequently, it is desired to develop emulsion compositions for flameproof
foam sheets having good mechanical strength, crack resistance, water resistance, alkali
resistance, blocking resistance, foaming property and embossing property, as well as
good flame resistance, without using vinyl chloride-containing polymers.Under the circumstances, the inventors made an extensive study, seeking an
emulsion composition for a flameproof foam sheet which satisfies all of the above-mention
mentioned properties, and found that an emulsion composition which
comprises ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer whose glass transition  
temperature is in the range from -25°C to +15°C and a toluene-insoluble part is 30% or
more by weight, and inorganic fillers, is superior in mechanical strength, crack
resistance, water resistance, alkali resistance, blocking resistance, foaming property,
embossing property, and flame resistance.Thus, the invention provides an emulsion composition for a flameproof foam
sheet which comprises the following components (A)-(C) wherein the amount of
component (B) is 5-50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of component (A)
(based on solid content), and the amount of component (C) is 50-350 parts by weight
per 100 parts by weight of component (A) (based on solid content):
