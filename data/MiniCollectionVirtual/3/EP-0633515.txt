<ABSTRACT>
A standardized microcontroller-based fuzzy logic 
processing module (101) for generating control signal values in 

response to variable input signal values in accordance with 
constraints imposed by propositions or "rules" stored in 

memory (117) in a standardized format. Each rule consists of one 
or more input conditions and an output directive. Each 

input signal (110) and the output signal (112) values are 
characterisable by their degree of membership in a 

predetermined number of fuzzy sets, each fuzzy set being 
defined by a membership function (119). Each input condition is 

composed of a reference to a particular input variable, 
which has been preprocessed into integer (whole number) 

normalised form and a reference to a membership function. 
Each output directive includes a reference to a further 

membership function. Each membership function is 
implemented by one of a three possible forms of standard 

membership data structures: a triangular function 
represented by three data points, a 
table lookup function 
represented by a two end data points and the points between 

these two end points, and an standard shape function 
composed of a set of data points and a set of reference 

points used to form a similar shape function by 
interpolation. Fuzzy logic processing is accomplished by 

determining the extent to which the input conditions are 
satisfied by the current values of the input signals in 

order to develop a rule strength value, and then performing 
a "centre-of-gravity" determination based on the output 

membership function values (118) of each satisfied rule integrated 
over the range of possible output signal values.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electronic
control systems and, more particularly, to a system for
generating process control signals which vary in response to
changing input signals in accordance with constraints
imposed by rules which state system objectives.Control systems typically use feedback mechanisms
to vary the value of an actuating signal in response to
variations in sensed system conditions. By manipulating
signals which are directly proportional to sensed system
conditions, as well as signals related to integrals or
derivatives of sensed signals, accurate control of many
dynamic systems may be successfully achieved. Such feedback
control systems work well because they are able to model
desired system performance, sense the state of the physical
system and compare it with the desired model, and generate
error-correcting feedback signals so that the physical
system behaves in accordance with the desired model.Frequently, however, even an elaborate
proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller cannot
accurately model more complex physical systems. Many
control functions which humans easily perform cannot be
automated by conventional feedback controllers. For
example, the functions which an experienced automobile
driver performs (turning the steering wheel, pressing the
brake and accelerator pedal, and shifting gears) can't be
handled by conventional controllers, because the driver's
movements are based on a complex inputs which the driver
processes based on past experience.A technique called "fuzzy logic," developed by Dr.
Lotfi Zadeh and described in "Fuzzy Sets," Information and
Control, Vol.8. No. 3, June 1965, pp. 338-53, has proven
highly effective in controlling complex systems. Using
fuzzy logic, input variables are processed against a
collection of rules, each of which expresses a system 
objective in propositional form; for example: "if velocity
is low and rpm is low then shift to 1st-gear." Unlike
conventional logic, in which conditions are either satisfied
or not satisfied, the conditions "velocity is low" and "rpm
is low" may be only partially satisfied so that the rule is
only partially satisfied. As a consequence, when the input
conditions are only partially satisfied, the rule and its
output directive to "shift to low gear" is assigned less
"rule strength". In the fuzzy logic based controller, many
such rules are evaluated concurrently. The actual gear
selection is performed by combining all directives from all
of the satisfied rules in accordance with the degree to
whi
