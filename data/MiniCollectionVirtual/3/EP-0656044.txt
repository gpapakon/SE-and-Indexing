<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of mono-olefins from a hydrocarbon feed containing one or more paraffinic hydrocarbons having at least two carbon atoms, the process comprising partial combustion of a mixture of the hydrocarbon feed and a molecular oxygen-containing gas in contact in a reaction chamber with a catalyst capable of supporting combustion beyond the normal fuel rich limit of flammability to produce heat of reaction, the reaction chamber being adapted such that at least part of the heat of reaction is transferred to the incoming feed and the velocity of the incoming feed is maintained at a value above the burning velocity of the feed mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production 
of mono-olefins. Olefins such as ethylene and propylene are extremely valuable 
industrial products both as monomers for homo- and co-polymer 
production and as a basic starting material for the production of 
other desirable chemicals. Such olefins may be obtained through 
various processes which include the steam cracking of hydrocarbons 
such as naphtha and liquid petroleum gas feedstocks or through the 
dehydrogenation of paraffinic hydrocarbons. European patent application 0332289 discloses a method for the 
production of mono-olefins which involves the partial oxidation of 
paraffinic hydrocarbons. Gaseous paraffinic hydrocarbons are mixed 
with a molecular oxygen-containing gas and contacted with a catalyst 
capable of supporting combustion beyond the fuel rich limit of 
flammability. The process, hereinafter described as autothermal 
cracking provides an efficient and cost-effective method of producing 
mono-olefins with yields being in excess of that obtained through the 
conventional steam cracking technology. The aforementioned process is successful for gaseous 
hydrocarbon feeds such as ethane, propane or butane. The process is 
equally applicable to liquid hydrocarbons such as naphtha, gas oil or 
vacuum gas oil. The liquid hydrocarbons, however, are commonly 
preheated and partially vaporised prior to entering the reaction 
chamber, thus requiring an additional step in the process. A problem 
associated with vaporisation of liquid hydrocarbons is that the  
 
conditions, e.g. high temperature, required to achieve vaporisation 
of heavier feeds may cause cracking of the hydrocarbons. 
Additionally, complete vaporisation is difficult to achieve and 
consequently a fine film of liquid can form on the catalyst which can 
reduce catalyst activity. Attempts to overcome the aforementioned problem fall into two 
general categories. Firstly, additional oxygen may be used to 
promote the combustion and to raise the temperature of the catalyst. 
This, however, results in a decrease in the yield of olefins. 
Alternatively, greater heat may be applied. In addition to the 
problem of cracking of the hydrocarbons, additional pre-heat may 
result in flashback or autoignition generating a flame at the 
fuel/oxygen mixing point. This type of flame generates very high 
flame temperatures and may result in carbon formation and thus a 
decrease in the yield of olefins. We have now developed a method for the production of mono-olefins 
using partial

A process for the production of mono-olefins from a hydrocarbon feed 
comprising one or more paraffins having at least two carbon atoms, the process 

comprising the steps of:
