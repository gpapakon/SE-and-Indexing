<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus according to the preamble of claim
1.Such an apparatus is known from EP-A-0 074 476. By way of general
description, the tape cartridge is comprised of a single reel containing a quantity of
magnetic tape and contained in a rectangular enclosure having dimensions on the order
of 4 inches in width, 5 inches in length, and I inch in height. The cartridge enclosure
includes an aperture in one of its major faces, to receive means for rotating the reel of
tape contained within the cartridge, and an aperture in one of its corners, for gaining
access to the free end of the web of tape. A so-called "leader block" is connected to the
free end of the tape, and is retained within the open corner of the cartridge so that it is
capable of being withdrawn from and replaced within the cartridge by appropriate
means.The known apparatus has provisions for receiving the tape cartridge and for
properly placing the web of tape which it contains in operative association with a
magnetic read/write head. The known apparatus is provided with appropriate means for
withdrawing the leader block from its nesting within the tape cartridge, and for
threading the leader block (and the web of tape) through the apparatus and past the
read/write head.To this end, special means are provided to engage the leader block assembly,
and to guide the leader block (and the tape which follows) through the transport
apparatus which is to operate upon the web of tape. This necessitates the development
of an appropriate path for threading the leader block through the apparatus, as well as
means which have sufficient driving forces to withdraw the leader block from its normally
seated position within the tape cartridge, and to replace the leader block within
this normally seated position after the tape cartridge has been used. To meet these
needs, as well as other design requirements regarding data density and performance
characteristics, the known device makes use of a leader block loading mechanism which 
is operated by a relatively large, dedicated driving motor, leading to significant
demands for space and power, and overall cost.It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus
for receiving and operating upon tape cartridge which is sufficiently compact for use in
prevailing mini/micro computer applications, without an attendant attenuation in
performance.These and other objects are achieved in accordance with the present invention
by providing an apparatus
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for a single reel cartridge comprising:

a loading rack (29) for receiving a tape cartridge (2) containing a web (15) of
tape on a supply reel (16) and including a leader block (25) engaging a free end

of said web of tape, said leader block (25) being normally seated within said
tape cartridge (2);
a supply motor (18) for engaging and rotating said supply reel;
a take-up reel (74) for receiving said leader block and said web of tape;
a take-up motor (73) for rotating said take-up reel;
leader block loading means (35) for transferring said leader block from said
tape cartridge to said take-up reel and for returning said leader block to said

tape cartridge, said leader block loading means (35) comprising:
a drive motor (76) having a shaft (80) receiving a drive coupling (77);
a first arm (78) pivoted for rotation about the shaft of said motor and coupled
with said drive coupling;
a head and guide assembly (160) including a magnetic read/write head (75) and
a plurality of guide means (161-163) for receiving said web of tape and for

directing said web of tape across said head;

characterized in that said drive motor (76) and said first arm (78) develop sufficient
driving torque to convey an unseated leader block from said tape cartridge to said take-up

reel (74) and insufficient driving torque to seat and unseat said leader block in said
tape cartridge, and that said leader block loading means (35) comprises a second arm

(79) being pivoted upon said transport apparatus to develop a lever between said drive

at a first end (85) a bearing (81) for slidingly receiving the shaft (80) of said drive

motor (76) and a flange (83) surrounding said bearing and having at least one slot (83a,
b) for receiving a driving pin (84a, b) extending from said drive coupling (77), and at a

second end a guide pin (33) for engaging said leader block (25), said second arm (79)
including at a first end (92) a slot (94) for receiving a driving pin (84b) extending from

said drive coupling and at a second end (89) a drive pin (90) extending from said
second arm and into engagement with a slot (91) formed in said first arm, the slot (91)

in said first arm (78) extending laterally from the second end (86) of said first arm to

the exterior of said first arm, to permit the drive pin (90) extending from said second
arm (79) to separate from the slot formed in said first arm.
The apparatus of claim 3, characterized in that the unseating means (100)
extend between said first arm (78) and the driving pin (84a) which engages said first

arm, and the unseating means is a spring-pin clutch, said spring-pin clutch including a
spring (100) which operates to facilitate removal of said leader block (25) from said

take-up reel (74) and said unseating means (100) operating to maintain relative positioning
between said first arm (78) and said second arm (79) in the course of operating said

leader block loading means (35).
