<ABSTRACT>
Inlet or exhaust line especially for reciprocating machine, consisting of a gas flow pipe (1), said pipe having at least one sensor (6) for measuring a physical quantity characteristic of the instant gas flow. The exhaust line further includes at least one device (3) for variably restricting the gas flow pipe cross section, causing an instant variation of the energy loss of gases flowing in said pipe (1) as a function of the quantity measured by the sensor (6), essentially to reduce low frequency gas pulsations and low frequency noise components resulting from its own presence in the gas duct. The inner pipe wall (1a) is lined with an acoustic energy absorbent material to attenuate high frequency gas pulsations and high frequency noise components generated in the pipe (1) by the restricting device (3).

Inlet or exhaust line, especially for a reciprocating 
machine, constituted by a gas flow pipe (1), the 

said pipe being fitted with at least one sensor (6) for 
measuring a physical quantity characteristic of the 

instantaneous flow rate of the gases, the exhaust line 
furthermore including at least one device (3) for 

variably restricting its cross-section for passage of the 
gases, which instantaneously varies the energy loss of 

the gases flowing in the pipe (1) as a function of the 
quantity measured by the sensor (6), characterized in 

that the internal wall (1
a
) of the pipe (1) is lined with 
a material (2) absorbing the acoustic energy and in that 

the line includes an electronic device for analysing the 
signal output by the measurement sensor (6) with a view 

to detecting and possibly diagnosing a malfunction of the 
reciprocating machine (9). 
Inlet or exhaust line according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the device (3) for restricting the 

cross-section of the pipe (1) acts on that part of the 
pipe (1) remote from the reciprocating machine (9). 
Inlet or exhaust line according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that that part of the pipe (2) located 

upstream of the restriction device (3) possesses a 
diameter greater than that of that part of the pipe which 

contains the latter. 
Inlet or exhaust line according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it includes a 

means for regulating the restriction device which causes 
attenuation of a preferential range of gas pulsation 

frequencies enabling a particular sonority of the inlet  
 

or exhaust line to be obtained. 
Exhaust line according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it equips a motor 

vehicle and in that the restriction device incorporates 
the speed of movement of the vehicle as an additional 

parameter in order to attenuate as much as possible the 
exhaust noise of the engine when the vehicle is moving at 

low speed and in order to minimize the pressure drops of 
the exhaust gases so as to improve the performance of the 

combustion engine when the vehicle is moving at high 
speed.
