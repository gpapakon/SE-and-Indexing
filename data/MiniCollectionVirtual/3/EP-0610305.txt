<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a surface with a sprayed composition including bitumen to form a membrane and which comprises providing a raw material supply of bitumen which is heated to 140 DEG C, and an alkaline supply of blending water which are heated and then blended to form a blended mixture/emulsion, and then pumped when required through a first delivery line to a first discharge head, and a further supply of water which is treated to be acidic is pumped along a second delivery line to a second discharge head, in which the first and second discharge heads are positioned close to each other and arranged to direct respective streams of the blended mixture and the acidic water to impinge one upon the other downstream of the delivery heads to form a dispersed spray which is then applied to the surface to be treated, and which then cures rapidly to form a membrane on the surface. The method of the invention and the components of the spray composition enable bituminous coatings to be applied without need for high temperature application as used in existing hot coating application of asphalt bitumen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COATING OF SURFACES WITH BITUMINOUS MEMBRANESThis invention is concerned with the coating of a surface with a bituminous membrane in order to render the surface resistant to penetration by water.There are many applications in which it is necessary to apply water-resistant coatings to surfaces, such as the inner linings of tunnels, flat roofs, storage tanks, sea defence applications, repair of concrete surfaces etc, and present techniques require a raw material feedstock of asphalt bitumen (which is semi-viscose at ambient temperature) to be heated to a substantial temperature (e.g. about 130°C), and then while still hot is applied as an asphalt coating to the surface concerned.It is important to apply the coating while the asphalt is still sufficiently hot, so that it can flow over the surface and fill any crevices, and thereby coat the surface evenly and without leaving any unprotected areas. If the asphalt should be allowed to cool too much before application, it can become difficult to handle and an unsatisfactory coating may result.Therefore using present techniques, typical coating rates (by trowelling) of only about 20 square meters per hour per man are achievable with a typical team of operatives.The present invention utilises the surprising discovery that bitumen can be treated in such a way that it can be rendered flowable at less elevated temperatures above ambient temperatures than is required for present hot coating application of asphalt bitumen, and such that the treated bitumen can be applied in sprayed form thereby increasing significantly the rate of application to a surface to be treate .The Applicants have found that a raw material feedstock of bitumen, such as a blend of 50 / 200 PEN bitumen, can be heated and then blended with heated water in a predetermined pH range (at least slightly alkaline and preferably of pH range of 8.5 to 12.5 dependent on ambient air temperature), 

 and subsequently stored at a lower (above ambient) temperature and which can then subsequently be withdrawn from store and, using a novel spray coating technique, can then be sprayed onto a surface to be treated to form a membrane.Accordingly, in general terms the invention provides a method of treating a surface with a sprayed composition including bitumen to form a membrane thereon, and comprising: providing a raw material supply of bitumen, and an aqueous blending medium in a pH range which is at least slightly alkaline; heating the bitumen and the aqueous blending medium; blending the heated bitumen and
