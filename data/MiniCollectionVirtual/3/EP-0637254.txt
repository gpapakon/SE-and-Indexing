<ABSTRACT>
Bonding solutions for granular bone replacements are provided, comprising hyaluronic acid or hyaluronic acid derivatives such as hyaluronic acid esters and hyaluronic acid antibiotic salts in combination with natural or artificial bone granules. These solutions can be used in human and veterinary dentistry and bone surgery as granular bone replacements to promote the growth and repair of damaged or defective bone tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new biomaterials,
i.e., bonding solutions for granular bone replacements
and bone replacements in the form of pastes, comprising
hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid derivatives.Hyaluronic acid is a natural polysaccharide
composed of alternating residues of D-glucuronic acid
and N-acetyl-D-glucuronic acid. It is a linear polymer
with a wide molecular weight range, depending on the
source from which it is obtained, how it is prepared,
and how the molecular weight is determined. In nature,
it is present in the pericellular gel, in the
fundamental substance of the connective tissues of
vertebrates, of which it is the main component, in the
synovial fluid of joints, in the vitreous humor, in
umbilical cord tissues, and in the combs of domestic
fowl. Specific hyaluronic acid fractions with definite
molecular weights are known which do not possess
inflammatory activity, and which can therefore be used
to enhance wound healing or substitute for endobulbar
fluids, or which can be used in therapy for joint
pathologies by intraarticular injection, as described in
European Patent No. 0138572, granted to Applicants.Also known are hyaluronic acid esters wherein all
or part of the carboxy groups of the acid are
esterified, and their use in the fields of
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and biodegradable plastic
materials, as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,851,521
and 4,965,353 also granted to Applicants.It is known that hyaluronic acid plays a
fundamental role in tissue repair processes, especially
in the first stages of granulation tissue formation,
stabilizing the coagulation matrix and controlling
degradation, favoring the recruitment of inflammatory
cells such as polymorphonucleocytes and monocytes, of
mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial
cells, and directing the subsequent migration of
epithelial cells.It is known that the application of hyaluronic acid
solutions to bedsores, wounds and burns accelerates
healing. The role of hyaluronic acid in the various
stages of tissue repair has been described, by
constructing a theoretical model, by Weigel P. H. et
al.: "A model for the role of hyaluronic acid and fibrin
in the early events during the inflammatory response and
wound healing," J. Theor. Biol., 119: 219, 1986. Granular bone replacements have been widely studied
and used in dentistry and medicine owing to their
biocompatible and osteoconductive properties, and
because they easily fill cavities of various forms, such
as those caused by alveolar bone shrinkage,
