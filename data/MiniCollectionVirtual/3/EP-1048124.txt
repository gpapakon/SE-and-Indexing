<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides systems and methods that include, inter alia, wireless communication systems that integrate wireless receivers and transmitters with host computer platforms and that include a data access channel that delivers into the memory space of an application program digital data that is representative of a base band modulated signal. Accordingly, these systems can employ wideband digitization of an incoming signal, such as an RF signal, direct the digitized data into the application memory space of a general purpose work station, and allow an application program operating on the general purpose workstation to perform the digital signal processing that obtains the information encoded within the digitized signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONSReference to Related ApplicationsThis case claims priority to United States Application No. 60/071,485, entitled "Virtual Radio" and filed 13 January 1998, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.Field of the InventionThe invention relates in general to communication systems and in particular to wireless communication systems that can communicate audio, video and data signals.Background of the InventionThe field of wireless telecommunications has grown rapidly in recent years, and the demand for wireless telecommunication services and equipment continues to grow. This notable growth is due, in part, to the proliferation of new communication standards and the development of new hardware technologies. For example, the successful adoption of cellular telecommunication standards has promoted the growth of the cellular telephone industry and driven the development of smaller and more power efficient cellular telephones that incorporate new hardware technologies that provide for greater conversion rates between the analog and digital domain, and greater digital signal processing power.Although the new these new standards and hardware technologies have provided a slew of new devices that often work exceptionally well, these devices are generally dedicated to a specific application and are based on application specific hardware designs are almost always restricted in the functionality they can provide. Specifically, the new hardware devices generally employ application specific hardware architectures, including proprietary 

bus architectures, components, and other proprietary elements, that reduce the flexibility of these systems and make the systems difficult to upgrade, difficult to extend, and difficult to scale.In part to address the extensibility issues that arise from the use of proprietary hardware architectures, digital radios, or software radios, have been developed. Software radios employ analog to digital converters and digital signal processors to process a broadcast band signal and generate a stream of data that is representative of the information being transmitted on a selected channel. Brannon, Brad, Wide-Dynamic-RangeA/D Converters Pave the Way for Wideband Digital-Radio Receivers, EDN ( November 1, 1996). The datastream can then be passed to a software application that further processes the datastream to perform the application at hand. For example, a software radio application that implements an FM radio receiver can process
