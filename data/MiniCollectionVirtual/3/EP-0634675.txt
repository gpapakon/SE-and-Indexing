<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a light conductive plate type 
light source, at least one light diffusing plate and a light 

reflecting plate are placed on the opposite illuminating 
surfaces of a light conductive plate in the overlapped state, 

and subsequently, a plurality of fixing members are press-fitted 
into the light conductive plate through the light 

diffusing plate and/or through the light reflecting plate 
with the aid of supersonic vibration applied to each fixing 

member. Thus, a securing operation can be achieved for the 
light conductive type light source at a remarkably improved 

efficiency regardless of the number of light diffusing plates 
to be placed on the light conductive plate in the overlapped 

state. In addition, the light conductive type light source 
can be produced at a reduced cost because no double-sided 

adhesive tape is required, and moreover, no supersonic 
welding operation is performed for each plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method 
of producing a light conductive plate type light source. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method 
of producing a light conductive plate type light source 
preferably employable as a back light source for a liquid 
crystal display unit which is widely used as a display 
section for a television, an office automation equipment or 
the like at present. EP-A-392 863 discloses a light conductive plate type light source which comprises a light diffusing plate, a light conductive plate, and a light reflective plate. These three plates are secured together by two holders, each one having the shape of a U-shaped bar. To facilitate understanding of the present 
invention, a conventional method of producing a light 
conductive plate type light source of the foregoing type will 
be described below with reference to Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows by way of fragmentary enlarged 
sectional view the structure of a light conductive plate type 
light source 90 produced by employing the conventional 
method. As is apparent from the drawing, the light 
conductive plate type light source 90 includes a light 
conductive plate 91 which is formed of a high transparent  
 
material such as an acrylic resin, and at least one sheet-shaped 
light diffusing plate 92 is secured to the light 
conductive plate 91 on a front surface 91a side while coming 
in substantially close contact with the light conductive 
plate 91 so as to allow a light beam to be emitted from the 
front surface 91a of the light conductive plate 91 with 
excellent uniformity, while a sheet-shaped light reflecting 
plate 93 is secured to the light conductive plate 91 on a 
rear surface 91b side of the light conductive plate 91 in 
order to improve a lighting efficiency of the light 
conductive plate type light source 90. The light conductive plate 91 and the light 
diffusing plate 92 (or the light reflecting plate 93) are 
adhesively secured to each other with double-sided adhesive 
tapes 94 interposed therebetween. In the case that a 
plurality of light diffusing plates 92 are used for the light 
conductive plate type light source 90 in order to improve a 
light diffusing property of the latter, the same securing 
operation to be achieved using double-sided adhesive tapes 94 
as mentioned above is repeated to build a laminated structure 
with the light diffusing plates 92. Next, another conventional method of producing a 
light conductive plate type light source will be described 
below with
