<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of preparing a dietary low cholesterol whole egg or egg yolk product, the method being characterized in that whole egg or egg yolk is dehydrated and then mixed with a low cholesterol extraction solvent based on liquid edible oils. The extraction solvent is allowed to act and then separated from the egg again in an oil removal procedure.

A method for preparing a dietetic, cholesterol-reduced whole 
egg or egg yolk product, 
characterized in
 that whole egg or 
yolk substance is dehydrated, then is mixed with a cholesterol-reduced 

extractant based on liquid food oils, the extractant 
is allowed to act, and then the extractant is removed during 

a de-oiling step from the egg substance. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the treatment 
by extractant as well as the following de-oiling step is 

repeated several times and where called for also with different 
extractants. 
Method according to the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in
 
that the extractant is removed only in part from the egg substance 

during the last de-oiling step. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the extractant is a mixture of an arbitrary liquid food 
oil with a cholesterol-reduced egg oil fraction or is cholesterol-reduced 

egg oil alone. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the extractant is a vegetal food oil or mixture of several 
vegetal food oils. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 5, 
characterized 
in
 that the de-oiling step is implemented by decanting, separation, 
filter pressing and especially by centrifuging. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 6, 
characterized 
in
 that the whole egg or the yolk are dehydrated by spray-drying.  
 
Method according to claim 7, 
characterized in
 that during 
spray-drying or in a subsequent step the whole egg or the 

yolk is formed into a grain size of 150µm to 300µm by 
means of instantisation. 
Method according to the claims 5 through 8, 
characterized 
in
 that following the last de-oiling step, the egg substance is 
additionally extracted with, supercritical fluids, preferably 

CO
2
. 
Method according to claim 9, 
characterized in
 that following 
the last de-oiling step and prior to extraction with supercritical 

fluids, the egg substance is formed by instant granulation 
into a grain size of 0,5 to 2 mm. 
Method according to the claims 9 and 10, 
characterized in
 
that an electrolyte, preferably cooking salt or calcium citrate, 

is added to the whole egg or yolk, prior to dehydration, in 
quantities between 0,1 and 2 % referred to the fresh-egg 

contents. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 11, 
characterized 
in
 that during extraction or at least during the last de-oiling 
step, an inert gas is made to pass through the egg substance 

in pressurized or in unpressurized manner. 
Method according to the claims 1 through 12, 
characterized 
in
 that the initial material is powdered egg yolk and in that 
the egg substance obtained following the treatment is mixed 

with a quantity of spray-dried egg white that corresponds to 
the natural whole egg composition. 
Dietetic cholesterol-reduced egg or egg-yolk product which 
can be prepared by a method defined in claims 5 through 13.  

 
Product according to claim 14, 
characterized in
 that its fat 
fraction is a mixture of vegetal food oils one of which being 

"red palm oil" in the natural state. 
Product according to the claims 14 and 15, 
characterized in
 
that its fat content essentially corresponds to that of the 

untreated egg or yolk. 
Application of the whole egg or egg yolk product which can 
be prepared by the method of the claims 1 through 13 in the 

preparation of foodstuffs. 
Application of the whole egg or egg yolk product which can 
be obtained as a byproduct in the methods according to the 

claims 1 through 13 as an emulsifier, colorant or flavoring 
agent in foodstuffs.
