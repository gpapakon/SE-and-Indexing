<ABSTRACT>
Apparatuses for filling packaging containers often include some form 
of metering device which makes it possible to fill each packaging container 

with a predetermined quantity of contents. In the case of relatively freely 
flowing contents, an apparatus for simultaneous filling of a plurality of 

packaging containers can, according to the present invention, be provided 
via individual filler pipes with a single flowmeter (26) which is located in one 

of the filler pipes and is operative to control filler valves (18) disposed in all 
of the filler pipes. Given that each flow path includes a reducer (28) in the 

form of a washer displaying a predetermined throughflow area, the flow 
resistance in the flow paths can be balanced so that each packaging 

container receives the correct quantity of contents even though only one 
flowmeter is employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for the simultaneous filling of a
plurality of packaging containers with liquid contents, comprising a holding tank
provided with a level meter, with filler pipes connected to the holding tank and a filler
valve associated with each filler pipe, whereby a flowmeter is located between the
holding tank and the filler valve in one of the flow paths, said flowmeter being
connected to a control device in order to operatively control all the filler valves.In filling machines used in the brewing and dairy industries, the
requirements on high filling capacity, precise filling accuracy, acceptable
washing and sterilization capability and overall economy are of decisive
importance. Filling machines for, for instance, bottles often fill a large
number of bottles simultaneously, in which event each bottle is advanced
by means of a conveyor to a filling station beneath a filler pipe through
which a metered quantity of the desired contents is fed. Each filler pipe is,
therefore, connected to a holding tank for the intended contents via a
metering or dispensing device, e.g. a piston pump which, in each working
stroke, measures and transfers the desired volume of contents from the
holding tank to the bottle. In the event of contents of low viscosity, e.g. freely
running liquids such as milk and juice, it is possible, instead of the relatively
expensive and complex piston pump, to provide each filler pipe with a
flowmeter and a valve controlled by the flowmeter, the valve opening when
the bottle has been placed in the correct filling position beneath the filler
pipe and closing when the flowmeter has measured the passage of the
desired volume of contents.Both of the above-outlined design and construction principles are
generally employed and have proved to satisfy adequately the established
requirements on efficiency, accuracy and washing capability. However, the
costs involved (in particular in large scale filling plants) are relatively high
since each filler pipe must be fitted with its own piston pump or flowmeter.
Since large-scale filling plants featuring 8, 16 or 32 filler pipes are not
uncommon, the capital investment costs will be considerable. In addition,
the large number of piston pumps or flowmeters requires meticulous
individual adjustment and control, which also correspondingly increases
running costs. A filling apparatus is known (EP-A-0 515 960), which uses one single flow-meter
located between the filling tank and a master filling valve. Said meter
ascertains
