<ABSTRACT>
The tyre mould includes a shell (1) for the moulding of the side walls, which shell (1) comprises a laminated assembly consisting of lamelliform elements (20) oriented substantially parallel to the axis, the moulding surface for the said side wall being constituted by the juxtaposed edges (24) of the said lamelliform elements (20).

<CLAIMS>
A tyre mould, comprising two shells (1) for
the moulding of the sidewalls of the tyre, and means

(4) for moulding the tread of the tyre, characterised
in that at least one shell (1) comprises a laminated

assembly formed of lamelliform elements (20) having
side faces and edges, side faces being oriented

substantially parallel to the axis of the mould and
being adjacent, and means for keeping said side faces

pressed against each other while maintaining sufficient
clearance (J) for the passage of air between said

lamelliform elements, the moulding-surface for said
sidewall being formed of juxtaposed edges (24) of said

lamelliform elements (20).
A mould according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the moulding edges (24) form a network of

concentric figures.
A mould according to Claim 1, characterised
in that said assembly is formed by winding a strip in

contiguous turns forming a spiral.
A mould according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the strip is wound with controlled axial offset

from one turn to the next in order to define a moulding
surface corresponding to the shape of the tyre sidewall

to be moulded.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the moulding surface is defined

by machining operations carried out on the edges of
said elements.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the clearance (J) between

adjacent lamelliform elements (20) is always less than
or equal to 0.03 mm.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the assembly of lamelliform

elements (20) is mounted on a support (10) provided 
with air evacuation paths arranged on the face (11, 12)

thereof which receives said elements (20) by their
edges opposite the moulding edges (24).
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the thickness of said lamelliform

elements is between 0.1 and 5 mm.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that at least one of said side faces

has transverse grooves extending from said edge to the
edge of said side faces which is opposite said edge in

order thus to form special paths for the venting.
A mould according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the grooves have a depth of the order of

0.01 mm.
A process for the moulding of a tyre,
consisting of using a mould according to one of Claims

1 to 10, in which, at the time of moulding, the
evacuation of the air is ensured, at least in part, by

channelling between the lamelliform elements.
