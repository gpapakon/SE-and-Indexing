<ABSTRACT>
The plug-in socket connection which is secured with respect to axial forces is intended for socket pipes (1) produced by centrifugal casting, in the case of which connection the spigot end (3) of one pipe can be pushed, with radial play, into the socket end (2) of the other pipe. Arranged in the latter are a sealing ring (8) and a clamping ring (14) which is designed separately from said sealing ring and comprises a multiplicity of clamping segments (15) arranged at intervals in the circumferential direction. Said clamping segmens exhibit a convex outer surface (17), connected to one another in the circumferential direction in each case by a vulcanised-on intermediate layer consisting of rubber or the like, and exhibit in each case a toothing arrnagement (19) on their inner surface (18). Integrally formed on the clamping ring (14) is a retaining part (20), which can be fixed in the region of the socket ends and bears said clamping ring and comprises an approximately conically tapering connecting portion (24) which extends to the clamping ring (14) and which, depending on the outer dimensions of the spigot end (3) to be introduced, can be widened together with the clamping ring (14) and can, in this arrangement, be expanded in the axial direction. In order to prevent corrosion of the toothing arrangement (9) of the clamping segments (15) due to penetrating moisture and oxygen, the connecting portion (24) exhibits, in its region extending from the clamping ring (14) with the clamping segments (15) to the retaining part (20), at least one annular sealing edge (34) which extends out radially inwardly and elastically encloses the spigot end of the introduced pipe.

Locking socket joint, particularly for formed pipe 
fittings and for centrifugally cast socket pipes (1), in which 

the tapered end (3) of one pipe can be inserted with radial 
play into the socket end (2) of the other pipe within which 

there are disposed a sealing ring (8) and, separate from the 
latter, a locking ring (14) which consists of a multiplicity 

of circumferentially disposed and mutually spaced locking 
segments (15) which, each having a cambered outer 

circumferential surface (17), being joined together 
circumferentially by a moulded-on intermediate layer of rubber 

or similar material and having toothing (19) on its inner 
surface (18), upon the occurrence of radial forces exert 

radial pressure towards the tapered end (3) through the 
combined action of the cambered circumferential surface (17) 

and an inner surface (18) of the pipe socket which tapers 
conically towards the end, there being formed on to the 

locking ring (14) a retaining part (20), capable of being 
located in the area of the end face of the socket and 

supporting the locking ring, having an annular elastomer 
section which possesses a greater flexural strength due to its 

stronger construction and comprising an approximately 
conically tapered connecting section (24), extending to the 

locking ring (14), which is capable of expansion together with 
the locking ring (14), dependent on the outer dimensions of 

the tapered end (3) to be inserted, while also being axially 
extensible and a recessed area, matching the cross-section of 

the stronger annular section (23), being provided in the area 
of the end face of the socket, characterized in that the area 

of the connecting section (24) extending between the locking 
ring (14) with the locking segments (15) and the retaining 

part (20) possesses one or more annular sealing edges (34) 
which extend radially inwards, elastically enclosing the 

tapered end of the inserted pipe.  
 
Socket joint according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
there is assigned to the sealing edge (34) on the outer face 

of the connecting section (24) an annular bead (36), extending 
outwards and increasing the elasticity of the sealing edge 

(34), which is accommodated and secured in position in the 
coupled socket joint by a circumferential recess (37) formed 

in the area of the socket end. 
Socket joint according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the circumferential recess (37) has an 

approximately semicircular cross-section. 
Socket joint according to either of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the annular bead (36) comprises two or 

several parallel ribs (38), oriented radially outwards, of 
which the axially outermost ribs bear elastically on the 

circumferential recess (37). 
Socket joint according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the width of the sealing edge (34), in 

the area of its base, is less than the width of the annular 
bead (36), in the area of its base, assigned to the outside of 

the sealing edge and, consequently, less than the width of the 
circumferential recess (37). 
Socket joint according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the annular bead (36) possesses a radial 

insertion aperture (42) for the insertion of a steel ring (39) 
which increases the flexural strength and in that the sealing 

edge (34) is formed on the side of the annular bead (36) which 
delimits the aperture on the side closest to the end face of 

the socket. 
Socket joint according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
both the circumferential recess (37) and the annular bead (36) 

have an approximately rectangular cross-section and in that  
 

the sealing edge (34) projecting radially from the annular 
bead (36) forms a lip. 
Socket joint according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the socket end (2) comprises a conical 

socket edge (40), extending radially inwards, the end of which 
projects beyond the end face (22) of the socket which lies in 

a plane perpendicular to the axis of the pipe and overlaps the 
retaining part (20).
