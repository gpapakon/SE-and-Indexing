<ABSTRACT>
A base for a transport or liquid container has a base frame for attachment of the upper part of the container frame. The container has a substantially stiff container frame provided with walls between which a flexible bag for the transport of a fluid is received. The base has a base vessel with a collar extending continuously along the rim, said collar being in the form of a bent downwardly extending edge. The collar is adapted to be received in an outwardly extending channel on the base frame in the mounting of the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
A base for a transport or liquid containerThe invention concerns a base for a transport or liquid container and of the type stated in the introductory por- tion of claim 1.Liquid containers are well-known and comprise a coated frame having walls to provide a closed container or box- shaped container. The container contains a bag with the fluid to be transported. An example of this is given in the Danish patent application 1787/86. The bag is placed in the container prior to filling. The bag is preferably flexible and possesses a not insignificant tear strength, and it may e.g. be made of a multi-layered plastics mate- rial, such as polyethylene. The bag provides tightness, while the container frame provides the necessary stabi¬ lity. The containers can therefore be constructed rather large and typically have a capacity of more than 1 m3. Handling of the containers takes place using fork trucks. It is a very attractive way of handling fluids - not only liquids, but also granulates and other grain material be¬ ing involved - since the transport volume has a very high degree of utilization in contrast to other forms of con¬ tainers, such as barrels and tanks. Further,, the con- tainers are collapsible, which minimizes the space re¬ quirement when empty containers are returned.Frequently, the fluids to be transported are hazardous liquids, so that liquid containers of this type are to offer good resistance to external impacts. In particular, in spite of some deformation, the container frame must not damage the bag containing the fluid. Thus, the container must be capable of dropping from a height of about i m without the bag contents leaking out, to satisfy the re- quirements made by the authorities for the container to be 

used for transport of hazardous goods. Following such im¬ pact the bag must still be tight. It is therefore a re¬ quirement that the container has no sharp corners or edges that might damage the bag following external impacts. It has thus been found that attachment of the base to the frame by welding, as done until now, requires dispropor¬ tionately large thicknesses of material in order to last, while a break zone at the welds often has sharp burrs that may damage the bag.Although the base vessel is supported by the transverse or longitudinal stiffening elements of the liquid container in the base, external impacts giving rise to even small deformations of the frame structure of the liquid con- tainer might cause formation of burrs capable of destroy¬ ing the bag, which results in

A base (20) for a transport or liquid container of the type having a substantially stiff container frame provided with walls, in which a flexible bag for the transport of a fluid is received, said base having a base frame (24, 25) for attachment of the upper part of the container frame, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by a base vessel ( 10) made in one piece and having a collar which extends continuously along the rim and has a bent, annular, downwardly protrud¬ ing flange or edge (18), said flange or edge (18) being adapted to be received in an open channel (42) on the base frame (24, 25) when the base vessel (10) is mounted.
2. A base according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the base vessel (10) is made by compression mould¬ ing of a metal plate.
3. A base according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the base vessel (10) has an opening (12) at its one side to receive an outlet.
4. A base according to claim 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e r - i z e d in that the side walls (13) of the base vessel
(10) extend obliquely upwardly.
5. A base according to claim 4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the side walls (13) form an angle with the verti- cal of the order of 10-30°.
6. A base according to claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the angle is about 15°. 


7. A base according to claims 1-6, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the bent edge (18) of the base vessel (10) is provided by rolling.
8. A base according to claims 1-7, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the channel (42) of the base frame (24, 25) is provided by bending outwardly extending plate parts from the horizontally arranged beams of the base frame (24, 25).
9. A base according to claim 8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the horizontally arranged beams of the base frame (24, 25) form a square frame structure which receives the base vessel (10) as a form fit.
