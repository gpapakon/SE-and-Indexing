<ABSTRACT>
The actuating cable has an axially movable transmission section which is connected by way of its end section (1) to connecting pieces (4). At least one of the connecting pieces (4) has an engagement section (10), which is provided with engagement elements (11), and the end section (1) associated with the connecting piece (4) has engagement elements (3) complementary to the engagement elements (11) of the connecting piece (4). A locking sleeve (13) is provided which holds the engagement elements (3, 10) of the end section (1) and the connecting piece (4) in engagement. The engagement section (10) is designed as a dimensionally stable engagement sleeve (5) and the engagement sleeve (5) has, at the side, an axial slot (8) via which the end section (1) can be inserted into the engagement sleeve (5).

<CLAIMS>
An actuating cable for the actuation of devices, particularly in vehicles, having the 
following features: 


a) the actuating cable has an axially movable transmission run for the 
transmission of force; 
b) the transmission run is attached via each of its end sections (1) to connection 
pieces (4) for connecting the transmission run at one end to an actuating organ 

and at the other end to an organ to be actuated; 
c) at least one of the connection pieces (4) has an engagement section (10) which 
is provided with engagement elements (11); 
d) the end section (1) which belongs to the connection piece (4) with the 
engagement section (10) has engagement elements (3) which are 

complementary to the engagement elements (11) of the connection piece (4); 
e) the transmission run and the connection piece (4) with the engagement section 
(10) are axially movable in relation to each other in their unconnected state 

and are axially fixed in relation to each other in their connected state; 
f) a locking sleeve (13) is provided which can be moved over the engagement 
section (10) from a release position, in which the connection piece (4) and the 

end section (1) can be brought into engagement with each other, into a locked 
position, and in this locked position holds the engagement elements (3, 10) of 

the end section (1) and the connection piece (4) in engagement; characterised 
by the following features:  

 
g) the engagement section (10) is constructed as a dimensionally stable 
engagement sleeve (5); 
h) the engagement sleeve (5) has an axial slot (8) at the side, via which the end 
section (1) can be introduced into the engagement sleeve (5). 
An actuating cable according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the axial slot (8) has a width less than that of the end section (1) 

and its boundary walls are constructed elastically in such a way that the end section 
(1) can be introduced into the engagement sleeve (5) with enlargement of the axial 

slot (8). 
An actuating cable according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the locking sleeve (13) comprises a locking projection (14) which 

extends as far as the outside of the end section (1) and engages in the axial slot (8). 
An actuating cable according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the axial slot (8) is widened in the region of the release position 

of the locking sleeve (13) so that the locking sleeve (13) can be twisted with the 
locking projection (14) in the widened portion. 
An actuating cable according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that the locking sleeve (13) is axially displaceably guided on the 

connection piece (4). 
An actuating cable according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that the engagement sleeve (5) is disposed at the end of the 

connection piece (4) facing the transmission run. 
An actuating cable according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that the engagement elements are constructed as engagement ribs (3, 

11) disposed axially in series.  
 
An actuating cable according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that the engagement ribs (3, 11) extend over the entire external 

circumference of the end section (1) and over the internal circumference of the 
engagement sleeve (5), respectively. 
An actuating cable according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that the end section (1) comprises a thickened portion (2) which 

engages in the engagement sleeve (5) and the engagement sleeve (5) has a stop, 
towards its open end, for the thickened portion. 
An actuating cable according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that the stop is seated in the open end (9) of the engagement sleeve 

(5). 
An actuating cable according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
 
characterised in that the locking sleeve (13) is spring-loaded towards the locked 

position.
