<DESCRIPTION>
 Training projectileField of the InventionThis invention relates to ammunition for self- loading automatic or semi-automatic weapons and for non- automatic firearms. More particularly, it relates to ammunition that fires a projectile of reduced range and penetrating capacity, while providing sufficient recoil or gas pressure to cycle an automatic weapon or to simulate a live round in a non-automatic firearm.Background to the InventionPractice ammunition capable of cycling a recoil- operated firearm has been described, for example, in U.S. patent 3,785,293 to Barr et al. Such ammunition has a projectile with a frangible casing and finely- divided filling, which disintegrates and disperses its contents upon exiting the barrel. Due to the mass of the filling, the recoil and report of regular ammunition is provided, with a reduced lethal risk from that associated with emitting a high velocity round. For purposes of training, it is desirable to have a firearm emit a round that is capable of marking 

 targets. For such purposes, at short ranges, it is not necessary for the projectile to have the mass of a regular bullet or standard round. In fact, for safety purposes, it is preferable that such a projectile have a low penetrating capacity, while at the same time remaining ballistically true at reduced ranges.It would also be useful to provide a round of less than lethal character which nevertheless can be designed to achieve varying degrees of carriage and striking force, while still providing for the normal operation of self-loading weapons and realistic operation for revolvers.U.S. patent No. 3,433,157 to E. Joch, describes a practice projectile that combines a disintegrating casing, packed with a dispersible mass of particles, with a subcalibre marking projectile. The marking projectile is mounted within a centrally located tube within the principal projectile, such tube serving as a barrel for the marking projectile. This marking., projectile is released from the main, outer projectile either during passage through the barrel or upon exiting from the muzzle of a firearm. The larger projectile, due to its frangible casing, breaks up in flight and disperses its heavy mass of contained particles within a relatively short range. 

 In the Joch invention special provisions control the advance of the marking projectile within its own barrel in synchronization with the advancement of the larger projectile down the barrel upon firing. The objects of these provisions are to ensure that the marking projectile is

<CLAIMS>
THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION IN WHICH AN EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGE IS CLAIMED ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
1. A projectile 1 for a self-loading firearm or non-automatic firearm, said projectile 1 comprising:
(1) a frangible, outer projectile casing 2 having a wall 3 which fragments upon exiting the muzzle 27 of the barrel 24 of a firearm;
(2) a dispersible mass 6 contained as a filling within such projectile casing 2, said mass 6 being finely divided so that it will self- disburse directly upon fragmentation of the projectile casing 2; and
(3) a ballistically stable targeting projectile 8 located rearward of at least a portion of the aforesaid dispersible mass 6, at least a portion of such dispersible mass being positioned directly forward of the targeting projectile 8 in the path. Such targeting projectile 8 will follow on firing, the overall mass of said projectile 1 being sufficient to simulate the recoil of a normal round and ensure the operation of the self-loading function of a firearm. 


 2. A projectile as in claim 1 wherein the targeting projectile 8 is aerodynamically inefficient, thereby having reduced range and penetration capacity as compared to a standard round of the same calibre for use in said firearm.
3. A projectile as in claim 1 wherein the targeting projectile 8 is of full-calibre, having a diameter sufficient to engage with rifling 26 in the inner surface of the barrel 
.
24 of said weapon upon iring.
4. A projectile as in claim 3 wherein the outside diameter of the targeting projectile 8 is defined by a protruding rim 15 which serves as a barrel-engaging portion of such projectile 1.
5. A projectile 1 as in claim 1 wherein the casing 2 is of full-calibre, the targeting projectile 8 is of less than full-calibre and targeting projectile 8 is coupled to the casing 2 whereby the spinning of the casing 2 will induce spinning of the targeting projectile 8.
6. A projectile 1 as in claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 wherein the disintegrating capacity of the casing 2 is 


enhanced by providing a full-calibre casing 2 with a diameter which provides for positive engagement of the casing with the rifling 26 within the barrel 24 whereby, upon firing, the casing 2 becomes scored and thereby disintegrates more readily under the centrifugal forces imparted by the rifling 26.
7. A projectile 1 as in claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 wherein the targeting projectile 8 is provided with a cylindrical portion 9 that is open at its forward end 10 and is closed by a capping portion 12 at its rearward end 11.
8. A projectile 1 as in claim 7 wherein said rearward end 11 is provided with a protruding rim 15 that functions as an air-brake.
9. A projectile 1 as in claims 7 or 8 wherein the forward end 10 of the targeting projectile 8 is directly exposed to the dispersible mass and a portion of such mass 6 is contained within said cylindrical portion 9 to serve as a filling for the targeting projectiles.
10. A projectile 1 as in claims 7, 8 or 9 wherein the targeting projectile 8 is ballistically balanced to maintain said forward end 10 oriented in the direction 


 of travel of such targeting projectile 8 and thereby contain and carry said portion of the dispersible mass 6 within its cylindrical portion after the projectile casing 2 fragments and said targeting projectile 8 continues to proceed towards a target.
11. A projectile 1 as in claims 7, 8, 9 or 10 wherein a portion of said dispersible mass located within the forward, nose end 4 of the casing 2 is in a compacted state.to provide support for the casing nose end 4.
12. A method of loading a projectile 1 for a self- loading firearm wherein said projectile 1 comprises:
(1) a frangible, outer casing 2 having a generally cylindrical casing sidewall 3 which will fragment upon exiting the muzzle 27 of a firearm 24, an open rearward end 7 and a closed nose end 4;
(2) a dispersible mass 6 in sufficient quantity to ensure that said projectile 1 will support the self-loading function of a self-loading firearm contained as a filling within such outer casing 2; and
(3) a generally cylindrical, ballistically stable, targeting projectile 8 having a cylindrical 


 portion 9 which is open at its forward end 10 and closed at its rearward end, said cylindrical portion 9 being dimensioned to fit sealingly within the base end 7 of said casing 2, the steps of the method comprising:
(a) first inserting an initial portion of the dispersible mass 6 into the casing 2 to fill its nose end 4;
(b) compacting said initial portion of the dispersible mass 6 within said casing 2;
(c) loosely filling the casing 2 with the remaining portion of the dispersible mass 6; and
(d) inserting said targeting projectile 8 with its forward end 10 first into the rearward end 7 of the casing 2 and thereby containing at least a part of said remaining portion of the dispersible mass 6 within the sidewall of the cylindrical portion of the targeting projectile 8.
13. A method as in claim 12 wherein said targeting projectile 8 is entirely filled with part of the remaining portion of said dispersible mass 6. 


14. A projectile as in claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 in combination with a self-loading firearm.
15. A projectile as in claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 13 wherein said dispersible mass 6 predominantly consists of finely-divided tungsten.
