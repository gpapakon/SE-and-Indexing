magnified image of an object onto a 2D array detector of IR sensitive 

elements, a processor for processing the information received from the 2D 
array detector, including controlling the integration time of the 2D array 

detector as a function of the magnification of the object to generate a 
thermal descriptive image of object, and a display for displaying the 

thermal descriptive image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to infrared (IR) microscopy and 
thermal analysis generally and, more particularly, to a staring infrared 
microscope (IRM) for operating in the medium and long wave IR 
subregions. The present invention also relates to a scanning IRM for 
operation in the long wave IR subregion. IRMs include optics for focusing IR radiation on IR sensitive 
detectors for producing an electric signal having an intensity proportional 
to the IR signal intensity impinging thereon. For staring and scanning 
IRMs, IR detectors are typically prepared from InSb and Cd·Hg·Te 
(CMT) semiconductor material, respectively. Other suitable materials are 
described in a chart entitled "Transmission regions of optical materials" in 
The Infrared Handbook, pg. 7-17 prepared by The Infrared Information and 
Analysis (IRIA) Center, Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, 
which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The performance rating of an IRM is typically described in terms of 
two parameters. First, its spatial resolution defined as the smallest 
distinguishable dimension of an object. Second, its thermal sensitivity 
defined as the smallest distinguishable temperature difference between  
 
adjacent portions of an object. For convenience, thermal sensitivity 
performance is often given in terms of its noise equivalent temperature 
(NET) which is the temperature difference equivalent to the RMS noise 
signal. Various infrared microscopes and their use in a range of infrared 
microscopy and thermal analysis applications, for example, non-destructive 
failure analysis of integrated circuits, microprocessors etc., and bioengineering 
applications, such as identification of bacteria are now 
described. Shell et al., in "Applications of Infrared Microscopy for Bond Pad 
Damage Detection", in the 1991 IEEE/IRPS Journal, pp. 152-159, which 
is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describe an IRM 
operating in the wavelength region of about 0.8 to 1.8 microns for the non-destructive 
failure analysis of plastic encapsulated devices. Yasuda et al., in "Direct Measurement of Localized Joule Heating 
in Silicon Devices by Means of Newly Developed High Resolution IR 
Microscopy", in the 1991 IEEE/IRPS Journal pp. 245-249, which is 
incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, describe an IRM 
which combines a ZnS objective lens and a Hg·Cd·Te IR detector having 
a maximum sensitivity around the 8 to 12 µm wavelength to achieve a 
practical spatial resolution
