<ABSTRACT>
In a pin-board matrix switch X- and 
Y-direction patterns are arranged in the X and Y 

directions to constitute a matrix. Crosspoint holes are 
formed at the crosspoints between the X- and Y-direction 

patterns. Each crosspoint hole has contacts formed 
therein. The contacts are connected to the patterns. A 

connecting pin has contact springs. The connecting pin 
is selectively inserted into the crosspoint holes to 

electrically connecting the contacts of the X-direction 
patterns and the Y-direction patterns which are adjacent 

to each other in the Z direction. Insulating members 
are arranged between the X- and Y-direction patterns. 

At least one pair of the X-direction patterns and the 
Y-direction patterns is constituted by first and second 

wiring layers arranged in the Z direction via insulating 
members. The two wiring patterns include cut portions, 

formed at corresponding positions, for dividing each of 
the first and second wiring patterns into two divided 

wiring portions, and conductor portions for connecting 
one divided wiring portion of the first wiring layer to 

the divided wiring portion of the second wiring layer 
which faces the divided wiring portion of the first 

wiring layer along the wiring direction and the other 
divided wiring portion of the first wiring layer to the  

 
remaining divided wiring portion of the second wiring 

layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pin-board 
matrix switch used for a main distribution frame or the 
like for a communication network in house wiring or the 
like. With the recent advances in intelligent 
buildings, various electric wires are jumbled in the 
buildings. Of these wires, wires constituting house 
wiring installed on a floor are classified into wires 
for a telephone system and wires for a LAN system. In 
many cases, coaxial cables have been used for the wires 
for a LAN system. There is a tendency to install 
twisted pairs of wires so as to facilitate wiring work 
or facilitate management of wiring by unifying wires for 
a telephone system and a LAN system. Congestion of 
floor wiring, i.e., disorderly installation of various 
kinds of cables, is one of the problems posed in a 
recent intelligent building. In order to solve this 
problem, a preliminary wiring work is performed by using 
twisted pairs of wires for floor wiring use under 
predetermined wiring management. Afterward, actual 
wiring work is performed in a patch panel on demand.  
 This patch panel wiring, however, is performed 
manually. Although systems for automatically performing 
wiring management have already been developed and are 
commercially available, a patch panel itself is manually 
installed. For this reason, an actual work result may 
disagree with wiring management data. In addition, 
cumbersome wiring operations must be manually performed 
in a patch panel wiring work, and it is difficult to 
change wiring. Under the circumstances, a pin-board matrix 
switch is used. With this switch, wiring can be easily 
changed by inserting/removing a connecting pin, and an 
automatic wiring work can be easily realized. This 
pin-board matrix switch can be manufactured by general 
printed board techniques and hence can be realized at a 
low cost. At the same time, a high-density switch can 
be realized. Therefore, the pin-board matrix switch is 
suitable for a reduction in size. On the other hand, a conventional pin-board 
matrix switch is only capable of allowing from telephone 
lines and up to 320-kbps time compression multiplexing 
transmission lines for ISDN basic interface (i.e., only 
capable of providing services via metal wires), but 
cannot keep up with the speed of a high-speed LAN 
demanded in the future. A conventional pin-board matrix switch like 
the one shown in Fig. 32 is disclosed in Japanese Patent  
 
Laid-Open No. 1-276524 (see also EP-A-0 339 653). This switch will be described 
below with reference to
