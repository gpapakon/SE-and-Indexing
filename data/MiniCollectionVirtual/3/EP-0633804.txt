<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ambulatory animal toy and more 
specifically to a toy which simulates the walking motion of a 
live animal when pulled due to a cooperation between a 
resilient spine and feet of the toy with a surface being 
walked upon. The invention described and claimed herein is mainly an 
improvement of the toy described in my U.S. Patent No. 
4,816,002, dated March 28, 1989. Express reference is herewith 
made to that disclosure with respect to details which 
are not specifically described herein. The legs of the prior art devices, including that disclosed 
in my afore-mentioned patent, were rigidly, non-pivotally 
attached to the body of the animal toy. Also, a great amount 
of stuffing was required, which often sagged within the skin 
and also restricted the proper walking motion. Furthermore, 
the bodies of the prior art devices, which may be formed of 
acrylic or spring steel, are either brittle or not fully 
resilient, i.e. they do not dependably return to their 
original shape.  
 It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide an 
ambulatory animal toy, which overcomes the hereinafore-mentioned 
disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices of 
this general type and which provides a vast improvement in 
the play value of the animal toy in that many different play 
positions are possible for the toy, such as standing, sitting, 
kneeling and lying, the stability and resiliency of the 
backbone is vastly improved and the amount of disadvantageous 
stuffing can be substantially reduced by providing a skeleton 
which resembles the shape of the finished toy more closely. With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, 
in accordance with the invention, an ambulatory animal 
toy, comprising a skeleton including a substantially horizontal 
torso having forward and rear ends defining forward and 
rear directions, mutually spaced apart front and hind legs 
attached to the torso, feet attached to the legs, means for 
providing friction between the feet and a walking surface, 
means for causing the torso to bend substantially horizontally 
while preventing the torso from bending substantially 
vertically when the skeleton is pulled, the means for causing 
the torso to wiggle and bend substantially horizontally while 
preventing the torso from bending substantially vertically 
comprising at least one piece of material incorporated in the 
torso being inherently resilient in the horizontal direction 
and inherently inflexible in the vertical direction, and  
 
means
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ambulatory animal toy, comprising a skeleton including 
a substantially horizontal torso having forward and rear ends 

defining forward and rear directions, mutually spaced apart 
front and hind legs attached to said torso, feet attached to 

said legs, means for providing friction between said feet and 
a walking surfaces, means for causing said torso to bend 

substantially horizontally while preventing said torso from 
bending substantially vertically when said skeleton is 

pulled, said means for causing said torso to bend substantially 
horizontally while preventing said torso from bending 

substantially vertically comprising at least one piece of 
material incorporated in said torso being inherently resilient 

in the horizontal direction and inherently inflexible in 
the vertical direction, characterised by means for pivotally attaching 

said hind legs to said torso and allowing rotation thereof 
about an axis substantially perpendicular to said forward and 

rear directions between a repose position in which said hind 
legs extend substantially horizontally and a standing position 

in which said hind legs extend substantially vertically 
relative to the walking surface. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 1, including 
means for pivotally attaching said front legs to said torso 

and allowing rotation thereof about an axis substantially 
perpendicular to said forward and rear directions.  

 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 1, wherein 
said feet are at least partially formed of rubbery material 

forming said means for providing friction between said feet 
and the walking surface. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 1, including 
spring means for biasing said rotatable hind legs in a 

substantially vertical position. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 2, including 
spring means for biasing said rotatable front and hind legs 

in a substantially vertical position. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 1, wherein 
said hind legs are in the form of two legs and wherein said 

means for pivotally attaching said hind legs to said torso 
include rotator disks for pivotally supporting said legs on 

said torso and a rotating axle extending through a hole 
provided in said torso and rigidly connecting said two hind 

legs mutually opposite one another and clamping said torso in 
between.  

 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 6, including 
spring means attached to said rotator disks for providing a 

restoring torque and for biasing said hind legs in a substantially 
vertical position. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 6, wherein 
said front legs are in the form of two legs, including 

rotator disks for pivotally supporting said front legs on 
said torso and a rotating axle extending through a hole 

provided in said torso and rigidly connecting said two front 
legs mutually opposite one another and clamping said torso in 

between. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 8, including 
means for attaching a leash to one of said rotator disks of 

said front legs for providing a restoring torque on said 
front legs into a substantially vertical position when the 

leash is pulled in the forward direction. 
The ambulatory animal toy according to claim 1, including 
spring means for assisting standing up from the repose  

 
position to the standing position and for biasing said hind 

legs in the standing position.
