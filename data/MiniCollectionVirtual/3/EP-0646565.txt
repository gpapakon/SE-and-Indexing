<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to substituted 2,6-dimethylbicyclo[3,3,1]non-6-enes 
defined according to the generic 
structure: 
wherein the dashed line represents a carbon-carbon single bond 
or a carbon-carbon double bond and wherein the moiety "R" 
represents one of the moieties: 
processes for preparing same and organoleptic uses of said 
substituted 2,6-dimethylbicyclo[3,3,1]non-6-enes in augmenting 
or enhancing the aroma of consumable materials. There has been considerable work performed relating to substances 
which can be used to impart (modify, augment or 
enhance) fragrances to (or in) various consumable materials. 
These substances are used to diminish the use of natural 
materials some of which may be in short supply and to provide 
more uniform properties in the finished product. Long-lasting, substantive and intense earthy, camphoraceous, 
woody, green, mimosa and violet leaf aroma nuances with 
rooty, vetiver, green, fruity, woody, violet leaf and mimosa 
topnotes are desirable in several types of perfume 
compositions, perfumed articles, colognes, deodorizing 
compositions and odor maskant materials.  The use of polycyclic nitrile and carboxaldehyde derivatives 
in perfumery for augmenting or enhancing the aromas of 
perfumed compositions, perfumed articles and colognes is well 
known in the art. Thus, the compound having the structure: 
is indicated to have perfume utility in Chemical Abstracts 
Volume 71:94695w (abstract of Netherlands Published Patent 
Application 6715903, published on May 28, 1969). U.S. Letters 
Patent 4,956,481 issued on September 11, 1990 (the 
specification for which is incorporated herein by reference) 
discloses the perfumery use of the compound having the 
structure: 
described as having a "green, woody and fir balsam-like aroma 
profile". Furthermore, U.S. Letters Patent 4,956,481 discloses 
the formation of the intermediate compound having the structure:  (along with many other compounds) in preparing the compound 
having the structure: 
which is indicated therein as having "a camphoraceous, gingery 
cardamon and woody profile" or a "sandalwood, woody, patchouli, 
rhubarb, ginger, minty and amyris aroma profile with amyris, 
camphoraceous, patchouli, woody and piney topnotes". U.S. Patent 4,956,481 always shows the existence of the 
compound having the structure: 
in small percentages in compositions along with the compound 
having the structure: 
and either the compound having the structure: 
or the compound having the structure: 
(which are in major
