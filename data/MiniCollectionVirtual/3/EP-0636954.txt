<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electronic control board for boilers of the so-called 
combined type and intended for home space heating and 
heating household water (commonly referred to as 
sanitary water) for example. Currently available from the market are 
compact high-performance boilers for home use which are 
controlled through electronic circuits formed on a 
small number (usually two) of printed circuit boards 
and cooperating to provide essentially the following 
basic control functions:
 
   flame ignition and monitoring, and
 
   flame modulation (regulation). A flame ignition and monitoring board is 
directed to ignite the boiler burner by actuating a 
spark generator, and to monitor the presence of the 
flame, shutting off the fuel (usually, but not limited 
to, gas) delivery system in the event of the flame 
going off (safety function). A flame modulation board is expected to 
handle the whole boiler functionalities, and 
constitutes the intelligent core of the apparatus. Its function is not limited to modulating the 
fuel flow rate according to demand, and includes  
 
checking that the power output exceeds neither a first 
predetermined value in the starting condition nor a 
second value after starting; that the temperatures of 
the sanitary water, when accessed, and the primary 
circuit heating water have preset values by the user; 
that the ambient temperature is kept within a 
predetermined range conforming with a heating program 
set by a programming clock; and that the heating system 
is turned off on the occurrence of abnormal events, 
such as temperature safeguarding actions (on either the 
primary circuit or the flue gas), absence of water in 
the primary circuit, or such malfunctions as breaks or 
shorts in the circuits of thermometer probes. Thus. the modulation board, which has evolved 
over time from regulating and monitoring systems of the 
analog type to digital systems with microprocessors and 
A/D conversion interfaces, is to perform multiple 
functions many of which can be tailored to the 
individual user and to match the specific 
characteristics of the various boiler types with which 
the board is to be associated for operation. Therefore, it is to meet plural requirements, 
including:
 
   ready adaptability to filling different demands, 
and easily tested board and system; and
 
 
   ease of system maintenance, fault-finding and 
repair. The control boards currently available from 
the market fail to meet these requirements. Adaptability to different demands
