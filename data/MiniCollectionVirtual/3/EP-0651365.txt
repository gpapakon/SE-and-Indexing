<ABSTRACT>
A tamper-indicating label which includes (i) 
light-transmissive facestock, (ii) a light-transmissive 

imaged release coating covering a portion of the 
facestock so as to provide indicia, (iii) a contrast 

enhancement coating over the release coated surface of 
the facestock, and (iv) an adhesive coated upon the 

contrast enhancement layer where the indicia provided 
by the release coating is not visible until the 

facestock is forcibly separated from the release 
coating after which the indicia becomes permanently 

visible and the label is provided with sufficient 
assembly cohesive strength to keep the label together 

as a single unit after the facestock is separated from 
the release coating and the indicia is rendered 

visually perceptible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tamper-indicating
labels. More specifically, the invention relates to
tamper-indicating pressure sensitive labels which
irreversibly display an image after removal from a
substrate to which it has been adhesively applied.A variety of tamper-indicating labels have
been developed for providing visual evidence that the
label has been completely or partially separated from
the container so as to provide access to the container.
A number of tamper-indicating labels are known
including those described in United States Letters
Patent Nos. 3,631,617; 4,121,003; 4,180,929; 4,588,465;
4,652,473; 4,684,554; 4,746,556; 4,763,931; 4,772,650;
4,876,123 and 4,980,222. One of the more successful
tamper-indicating labels is disclosed in United States
Patent No. 5,153,042 issued to Indrelie and assigned to
the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St.
Paul, Minnesota. Briefly, the tamper-indicating label
of Indrelie includes an imaged layer of a release
coating positioned between layers of transparent
facestock and frangible metal whereby removal of the
applied label separates the metal layer between a
residual image -- defined by the image of the release
coating -- left on the substrate and a negative of the
image appearing on the facestock removed from the
substrate. Efforts to conceal tampering by realigning
the label are prevented by the loss of intimate contact
between the layers of the label after separation.US Patent n° 4,763,931 which corresponds to FR-A-2,597,405
discloses an adhesive material for preventing reuse. The laminate
construction includes first and second layers which, when separated,
cannot be readhered.Tamper-indicating labels -- available from
the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St.  
Paul, Minnesota under the trademark SCOTCHMARK™
(product numbers 7381 and 7384)-- possess the attribute
of leaving a tenaciously adhered residual message of
tampering on the substrate. This attribute is highly
desired whenever evidence of tampering is wanted on the
substrate. However, in some situations it is desirable
to have a label which displays permanent evidence of
tampering when any attempt is made to remove it from a
substrate but does not leave any residue on the
substrate upon removal. Optionally, the label would
leave a residue upon removal but the residue is easily
removable without the use of solvents. Tampering or
unauthorized entry is evidenced by either activation of
the tamper-indicating image on the label or a complete
absence of the label.Such

<CLAIMS>
A tamper-indicating label (10) comprising sequential
layers of:


(
a
) a planar light-transmissive facestock (20) having
first and second major surfaces,
(
b
) a light-transmissive imaged release coating (30)
providing indicia on the label, and
(
c
) an adhesive coating layer (60);

wherein (
i
) the indicia is not visible until becoming
permanently visible when the release coating (30) is

separated from at least one of the other layers in the
label (10), and (
ii
) the assembly cohesive strength of the
label (10) is sufficient for the label (10) to remain together

as a single unit after the release coating (30) is separated
and the indicia becomes visually perceptible.
A tamper-indicating label (10) for application to a
substrate comprising sequential layers of:


(
a
) a light-transmissive facestock (20) having first
and second major surfaces,
(
b
) an imaged release coating (30) covering less than
the entire area of the second major surface

of the facestock (20) for providing a message,
(
c
) a contrast enhancement coating (50) covering the
release coating (30) and contacting the facestock (20)

in those areas void of release coating (30), and
(
d
) a pressure-sensitive adhesive (60)

wherein (
i
) the message is not visible until becoming
permanently visible when the facestock (20) is separated

from the release coating (30), (
ii

contrast enhancement coating (50) will not separate from the

facestock (20) upon removal of the applied label (10) from the
substrate (100), (iv) the adhesive strength between the
