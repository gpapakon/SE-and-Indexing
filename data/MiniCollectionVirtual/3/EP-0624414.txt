<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for manufacturing a crankshaft (1) which has an oil passage (3). The method consists essentially in that a thin-walled tube (2) is arranged in such a way at that point in the casting mould in which the oil passage is provided that the tube is embedded in the body of the crankshaft during the subsequent casting operation. This makes it possible to eliminate the expensive process of subsequent production of the oil passage by drilling.
