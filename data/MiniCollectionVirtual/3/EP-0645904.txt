Cross-connect apparatuses (102) to which a plurality of broadcasting stations (108) are connected in a tree 
network form by a collection system transmission line (103) consisting of optical fibers to form a collection network 

(100). A distribution system transmission line (104) consisting of optical fibers connects distributors (105) into a 
tree network form so as to form a distribution network (101), which is connected to one (102) of the cross-connect 

apparatuses of the collection network (100). A plurality of distribution nodes (107) are connected in a star form to the 
distributor (105). The distribution nodes (107) are connected to a subscriber's network, and distributes broadcasting 

signals transmitted from the collection network (100) to each subscriber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wide area 
broadcasting communication system which utilizes a wide 
area communication network such as a broad-band ISDN. A communication network has recently been digitized 
on an international level. In Japan, NTT has already 
put a digitized communication network to practical use 
and started services of INS NET 64 and INS NET 1500. 
According to these services, a speech communication 
terminal, a facsimile communication terminal, a data 
communication terminal, and the like, which have been 
conventionally connected to their respective communication 
networks (speech communication network, facsimile 
communication network, data communication network), have 
only to be connected to a single communication network. 
The idea of such a communication network is called an 
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and results 
from an international standardized work which has been 
managed mainly by the CCITT (International Telegraphy 
and Telephone Consultative Committee). The ISDN is 
classified into an N-ISDN (Narrow-band ISDN) in which 
the upper limit of the capacity of the transmission line 
is 1.544 Mbps or 2.048 Mbps, and a B-ISDN (Broad-band  
 
ISDN) in which the upper limit of the capacity of the 
transmission line is 155.52 Mbps or 622.08 Mbps and 
which allows a motion image service. At present, the N-ISDN is of considerably more 
practical use and provides various types of service, 
whereas a service using the B-ISDN is still in the 
studying stage, and there are few specific examples 
applicable to the B-ISDN. The current motion image service is represented by 
TV broadcasting. However, this service is provided 
chiefly to the metropolitan area, and only some of the 
programs provided to the metropolitan area can be 
enjoyed in the local areas. Further, the TV programs 
produced by a broadcasting station in a local area 
cannot be enjoyed in the other areas. A large number of 
people, who come from the country and work at companies 
in the metropolitan area, can learn of the states of 
their hometowns only on the local news provided by the 
broadcasting stations in the metropolitan area. As 
described above, the current TV broadcasting does not 
necessarily provide the same programs throughout the 
country and is therefore a service in favor of the 
metropolitan area. The present invention has been developed in 
consideration of the above situation and its object is 
to provide a broadcasting communication system which 
allows multichannel videos to be
