<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
head, an ink jet apparatus provided with the ink
jet head, and an ink-jet cartridge.An ink jet system which conducts printing by
forming ink droplets and projecting the droplets onto a
recording medium like a paper sheet is advantageous,
since the printing can be conducted with extremely low
noise at a high printing speed, and color printing can
easily be practiced with compactness of the apparatus
owing to a smaller size of the printing head. Lately,
a bubble jet system is noticed which ejects ink
droplets by bubbling of an ink by heating element.The ink jet head is prepared, for example, by
forming a heating element, a driving circuit (e.g., a
shift register), a wiring pattern on a silicon
substrate by a conventional silicon process; die
bonding the silicon substrate on an aluminum base plate
onto which a printing substrate for contact with the
main body of an apparatus has been preliminarily
bonded; connecting the silicon substrate electrically
with the printing substrate by wire bonding; bonding 
the base plate with a ceiling plate having grooves for
an ink liquid chamber and an ink flow path formed by
injection molding and an ink discharge opening formed
by excimer laser with adjustment of the relative
position of the ink discharge opening provided on the
substrate and the heat-generating element provided on
the ceiling plate; fixing the base plate with the
ceiling plate by a spring; fixing further a member for
supplying ink to the base plate by thermal caulking or
a like method; and sealing the bonding interfaces with
a sealant.Fig. 1 illustrates schematically a disassembled
ink jet cartridge which has a cartridge body 1000 and is
constituted integrally from an ink jet unit 13 and an ink
tank 14. A silicon substrate (heater board) 100 having a
heating element formed thereon is bonded by die bonding
onto a base plate 300 made of aluminum or the like. A
print wiring substrate 200 is also bonded onto the base
plate 300. The heater board 100 has a preliminarily formed
heating element, a shift-register for driving, and a wiring
pattern formed by a silicon process. On the wiring substrate
200, contact pads 201 for contact with the main body of the
apparatus and wire bonding pads (not shown in the drawing)
for contact with the silicon substrate are formed in a
conventional wire bonding method. A ceiling plate 1300 and the heater board 100 form
an ink jet head 12. The ceiling plate 1300 is fixed to the
heater board with a spring 500. The ceiling plate 1300 has
