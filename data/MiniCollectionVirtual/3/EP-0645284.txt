<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a so-called bicycle carrier device (1) for transporting at least one bicycle (2) substantially against the rear face (3) of a motor vehicle (4). The device (1), comprising a support part (15) and a spacer part (16), is characterised in that the uprights (15A) of the support part (15) are extended beyond an articulation (17A) with the spacer part (16), and the extension is sufficient, whilst allowing the support part (15) to bear against a stop on the vehicle, such as the rear bumper, to raise the support means (13) so that the bicycle is supported above the vehicle signalling equipment.

A cycle carrier device (1) for transporting at least one cycle (2) substantially against the 
rear face (3) of a motor vehicle (4) and approximately transversally to the vehicle, 


which motor vehicle (4) includes a roof (7) having an upper face (8) and non-restrictively 
a rear bumper (5) situated substantially at mid-height of its rear wheels, 
the rear face (3) for its part being constituted by elements of the vehicle which extend 
between a plane situated under the normal level of a possible rear bumper (5) and a plane 

tangent to the upper face (8) of the roof (7) of the vehicle (4), 
the device (1) including a structure (9) intended to constitute an interface between the 
rear face (3) of the body of the vehicle (4) and the vanous components of at least one 

cycle (2) so as to enable the latter to be transported notably without any direct contact 
with the body elements constituting the said rear face, 
the structure (9) notably including two pieces (15, 16) which on the one hand are each 
constituted by a U-shaped element, that is to say an element comprising two 

approximately parallel uprights (15A, 16A) connected by a median leg (15B, 16B) 
substantially perpendicular thereto, and on the other hand are - by a first indexed 

articulation device (17) - articulated relative to one another about a first axis (17A) via 
their uprights (15A, 16A) in such a way that their median legs (15B, 16B) can be moved 

apart or brought together whilst remaining substantially parallel, irrespective of the 
articulation position of the two pieces (15, 16), 
in this structure (9), one (15) of the said U-shaped pieces (15, 16) - known as a support 
piece - having one of its ends intended to be placed at the normal level of a possible 

bumper (5) of the vehicle, and the other piece (16) - known as a distance piece - being 
intended to rest on the body at a considerable distance above the normal level of the 

bumper, 
the structure including moreover a means (13) for supporting and stowing at least one 
cycle (2) on the said structure, the supporting means (13) comprising two elongate arms 

(18), 
the uprights (15A) of the support piece being extended beyond the first articulation axis 
(17A) and the supporting means (13) being connected to the extensions of the uprights 

(15A) of the support piece (15) at a point (19) situated at a certain distance (D1) from the 
first articulation axis (17A) and at the opposite end from the end of the support piece 

intended to be placed at the level of a possible rear bumper,  
 
while allowing the supporting of the support piece (15) on a stop of the vehicle, such as 
the rear bumper, the extension of the said uprights (15A) of the support piece (15) being 

sufficient to raise the supporting means (13) so that the cycle is brought above the 
signalling equipment of the vehicle, 
the support piece (15) - intended to rest an the vehicle at the normal level of a rear 
bumper (5), on a stop formed in a substantially horizontal plane - has its uprights (15A) 

which are each identically bent in a plane perpendicular to the median leg (15B) 
connecting them, 
 
this device being characterised in that the two elongate arms (18) of the supporting 

means (13) are borne by the support piece (15) by means of a second means (20) for 
indexed articulation about a second axis (19) substantially parallel to the first axis (17A) 

and comprising the said point (19). 
A device in accordance with Claim 1, including a means (23) for adjusting the distance 
(D1) between the lying point (19) of each arm and the articulation axis (17A) of the 

first articulation means (17), this device being characterised in that the means (23) is 
constituted by a plurality of bores made in the uprights (15A, 15B [sic]
), each of the 
trunnions constituting the articulation axis of the first articulation means (17) being able 

to be removably fixed in each of the bores. 
A device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the length of the 
rectilinear portion of the support-piece uprights (15A) beyond the linking point (19) of 

each supporting arm is greater than the diameter of the wheels of an adult cycle. 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the distance 
(D1) between the linking point (19) of each supporting arm and the articulation axis 

(17A) of the first articulation means (17) is between one hundred millimetres and six 
hundred millimetres. 
A device in accordance with any one Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the distance 
(D1) between the linking point (19) of each supporting arm and the articulation axis 

(17A) of the first articulation means (17) is four hundred and forty millimetres. 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that: 

the length of the substantially rectilinear portion - intended to support the elongate 
arms (18) - of the uprights (15A) of the support piece (15) is nine hundred and thirty 

millimetres,  
 
the length of the other portion of the uprights (15A) of the support piece (15), that is to 
say the portion intended to rest on the rear face (3), is two hundred and thirty millimetres, 
the uprights (16A) of the distance piece (16) are two hundred and fifty millimetres in 
length, 
the elongate arms (18) of the supporting means (13) are each four hundred millimetres 
in length.
