<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for subdividing an arbitrarily 
shaped object into a collection of geometric elements ("cells") having 

predefined, simple topologies which facilitate further subdivision into 
tetrahedra, and which are well suited for further applications, such as 

finite element calculations. Initially, a representation of the object 
includes one or more regions, at least one of the regions not meeting the 

definition of "cell", each region having vertices, edges, and faces. An 
edge is selected according to a priority scheme, and slices which run 

through the edge and which also either run through other edges or 
vertices of the representation, are coplanar with other faces of the 

representation, or have other predetermined attributes, are considered 
for use in subdividing the representation. A score, which was 

initially calculated for the representation, is recalculated for 
hypothetical subdivisions of the representation incorporating each 

respective one of such slices. The scores are related to predetermined 
factors, such as the number of regions which are cells, relative to the 

total number of regions, the number of faces whose topologies correspond 
with the topologies of faces of cells, relative to the total number of 

faces, and factors relating to the shapes of the regions and faces. For 
one of the slices, the score is maximized. The representation is then 

subdivided, using that slice. This process is repeated until no regions 
of the representation remain which do not meet the definition of a cell. 

The method of the invention is preferably practiced using parallel 
processing at one or more levels. That is, either (i) different regions 

of the object are subdivided in parallel, (ii) for a given region, 
interesting slices are scored for different high-priority edges in 

parallel, (iii) for a given high-priority edge of a given region, 
interesting slices through that edge are scored in parallel, or a 

suitable combination thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the field of computer modeling
and analysis of physical objects. More specifically, the invention
relates to a method for dissecting an object into a representation made
of primitive elements.Many computational methods operate over a region of n-dimensional
space. For instance, a solid object may be modeled as a digital
representation. Finite element analysis is one of many computational
applications to which such a model is put.It has been found that such computational methods are facilitated
if the digital representation of the object is made in terms of a set or
collection of simple geometric elements. Depending on the number, size,
and shape of the elements, and on their configuration relative to each
other, an arbitrarily shaped object may be modeled to a desired degree of
accuracy.It has also been found preferable that the elements making up the
representation of the object be taken from a set of known elements having
redefined simple topologies. For modeling three-dimensional objects, the
simplest element is the tetrahedron. Other simple three-dimensional
elements include the pentahedron and the hexahedron.The process of preparing a digital model of an object for use in
computations includes decomposing the object into a collection of
elements from the set of known elements. It is preferable that the
collection of elements fit the object as naturally as possible. The
elements fit the object naturally if the boundaries between elements of
the collection tend to follow edges of the object, and the sizes of the
elements tend to be greater along straight, or otherwise continuous,
portions of the object.It is desirable that the collection of elements fit the object
naturally because the dependence of the computational solution on a given 
subdivision is reduced. The Finite Element method is a computational
method commonly used with such element representations of objects. A
finite element computation is essentially an interpolation of a function
between endpoints made up of the vertices or edges of one of the
elements. There are two types of finite element computations, called
h-type and p-type.In h-type finite element analysis, the function is evaluated for a
given polynomial order. As a consequence, there is an inherent
limitation as to how closely the interpolation can follow the changes in
value of the function between two given endpoints. Thus, the accuracy of
the interpolated result is inversely related to the distance between the
endpoints. Therefore, in an
