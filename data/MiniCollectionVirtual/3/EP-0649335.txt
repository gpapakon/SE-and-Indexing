<ABSTRACT>
The filter device (10) comprises a filter element (12) including a filter medium (20) arranged in zig-zag shaped pleats. On its two longitudinal sides extending in the pleating direction (36), the filter medium (20) is provided with stabilizing strips (34) bonded thereto for stabilizing the zig-zag shaped pleated configuration of the filter medium (20). During use of the filter device (10), the filter element (12) is arranged within a filter element holding frame (14) which is inserted in a holding means, e.g. in the air inlet shaft (18) of an air conditioning system. Due to a certain inherent stability of shape of the filter medium (20) and the stabilizing strips (34), the filter element (12) is sufficiently firm and has a self-supporting construction. The filter element (12) is easy to handle and can be inserted into the filter element holding frame (14) in a simple manner. Except for the actual filter medium (20), the filter element (12) requires little extra material, i.e., for the stabilizing strips (34), in order to ensure stability of the device. Thus, when replacing the filter element (12), the quantity of waste material to be disposed of in addition to the filter medium (20) is extremely small.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a filter device for 
the filtration of gases and/or fluids, and particularly 
for the filtration of air streaming into the passenger 
cabin of a motor vehicle. Filter devices for the above uses are known in a 
large variety of types. For enlarging the volume of 
the filter medium having the gas or the fluid passing 
there-through for cleaning, a known approach has been 
to arrange the filter medium in zig-zag pleats. Thus, 
in a large number of known filter devices, the filter 
element comprising the filter medium has a pleated 
configuration which is exposed to the flow to be 
cleaned. In most cases, the filter elements are 
enclosed by a filter element holding frame for 
stabilization. Filter devices of the above type are known, e.g., 
from US-A-3 246 457, GB-A-1 570 385 and EP-A-0 450 
299. A common disadvantage of these known filter 
devices resides in that the exchangeable part of the 
filter device encloses the filter element and the 
holding frame of the filter element. However, these 
two components of known filter devices consist of 
different materials, thus complicating any 
environmentally friendly disposal of the disposable 
parts of known filter devices. Further, the quantity 
of waste or disposable material is considerable because 
the stabilization of the pleated structure of the 
filter medium of the filter element necessitates 
relatively large quantities of material which, when  
 
exchanging the filter medium, have to be exchanged as well and 
thus have to be disposed of. It is an object of the invention to provide a filter 
device for the filtration of gases and/or fluids, and 
particularly a filter device for the filtration of air 
streaming into the passenger cabin of a motor vehicle, wherein 
the quantity of material which is not used for the cleaning of 
gases and/or fluids, but which must be disposed nonetheless 
when replacing a spent filter medium, is as small as possible. For solving the above object, the invention proposes a 
filter device of the above type comprising the following 
features: 
a filter element including a filter medium pleated in zig-zag 
manner, wherein said filter medium, on its two longitudinal 
sides extending in the pleating direction, is provided with 
stabilizing strips for stabilizing the zig-zag-shaped pleated 
configuration of the filter medium, said stabilizing strips 
being bonded to the longitudinal edges of the filter medium, a filter element holding frame having longitudinal and 
transverse frame portions and

A filter device for the filtration of gases and/or 
fluids, and particularly for the filtration of air 

streaming into the passenger cabin of a motor vehicle, 
comprising: 


a filter element (12) including a filter medium 
(20) pleated in zig-zag manner, wherein said 

filter medium (20), on its two longitudinal 
sides extending in the pleating direction, is 

provided with stabilizing strips (34) for stabilizing 
the zig-zag-shaped pleated configuration 

of the filter medium (20), said stabilizing 
strips (34) being bonded to the longitudinal 

edges (38) of the filter medium (20), and wherein 
the two stabilizing strips (34), on each of 

their outer sides (39) facing away from the filter 
medium (20), are provided with a sealing 

medium (42), 
a filter element holding frame (14) having longitudinal 
and transverse frame portions (44,46) 

and being adapted for insertion of the filter 
element (12) therein and for removal of the filter
