<ABSTRACT>
The present inventive process comprises blending 
polyphenylene powder with a liquid epoxy material, 

optionally with flame retardants and catalysts, 
preferably in a high shear mixer at elevated temperature, 

e.g. in the range of about 100°-130°C. The resultant 
upstaged or partially-cured blend is sufficiently 

solidified to be granulated into a powder for Wiggins 
Teape processing or, optionally, conventional press 

processing into a fiber reinforced laminate. Resin 
systems thus-prepared exhibit both improved solderability 

resistance and improved resistance to organic solvents 
when compared to thermoplastic systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making thermoset polymer resin 
laminates and to products characterized by excellent solderability and solvent resistance 
which are prepared using such process. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
thermoset compositions comprising blends of polyphenylene ethers and certain 
multifunctional acrylics, e.g., triallylcyanurate, diallyl maleate, and methacryloyl chloride, 
which offer processing, cost, and/or performance advantages over the existing 
polyphenylene oxide/epoxy state-of-the-art, particularly in consumer electronic laminate 
applications. Metal-clad boards, particularly such boards for use in fabricating printed circuits, 
are well-known in the art. The simplest of such boards generally comprises a resinous 
plastic (polymeric) substrate to which is bonded at least one thin sheet of an electrically 
conductive material, preferably copper. The resinous plastic substrate can be clad with the 
metal foil on one or both sides, depending upon the desired use, and can be rigid or flexible 
depending upon the composition of the resinous plastic substrate, the choice of 
reinforcement (if any), and the intended use of the board. A number of polyphenylene ether compositions having favorable dielectric 
properties and utility in circuit board manufacture are known. However, due to 
deficiencies in one or more properties, many such compositions have not attained wide 
commercial use. In specific, while polyphenylene ethers are excellent dielectrics, 
deficiencies often are found in areas such as solvent resistance, flammability, solderability, 
and resistance to high temperatures. Moreover, times required for curing such 
compositions typically are too long for effective manufacture of circuit boards in large 
volume. Polyphenylene ethers are often combined with polyepoxides in an attempt to 
improve upon the aforementioned properties, but such combinations have not been found 
to be wholly satisfactory either. In addition to excellent dielectric properties, resinous compositions to be used for 
printed circuit board manufacture should be highly flame-retardant. A V-1 rating, as 
determined by Underwriters Laboratories test procedure UL-94, is universally required, 
with V-0 usually being necessary. The V-0 rating requires a flame-out time (FOT) of not 
more than 10 seconds in any trial and a cumulative FOT of not more than 50 seconds for 
five samples. As a practical matter, a maximum cumulative FOT of 35 seconds often is 
mandated by
