<ABSTRACT>
An intuitive graphical user interface is based upon a geographic 
map structure, and includes a system for controlling remote external electronic 

devices. In the defined graphical user interface, each Space of the geographic 
map structure is rendered on a touch screen display as a graphic image of a 

geographic space. Within each Space are colored cartoon-like icons called 
"objects" which can be Selected and manipulated by the user. Certain objects, 

referred to as portals, transport the user from one Space to another Space when 
Selected. Other objects, referred to as buttons, perform associated actions or 

functions when Selected. The graphical user interface is displayed on a hand-held 
display device used to control remote devices. Each remote electronic 

device transmits a user interface program object that defines a graphical user 
interface to the display device. The hand-held display devices displays the 

graphical user interface associated with the remote device when a user selects an 
icon associated with the remote device on the display device's touch screen 

display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of graphical user
interfaces for computer systems and, more particularly, to a method and
apparatus for providing an intuitive methodology for an operator to control
remote devices with a computer controlled object-oriented user interface
utilizing animated graphic images.Most popular graphical user interfaces that are available today,
such as the Xerox Star®, Apple Macintosh®, and Microsoft Windows
graphical user interfaces, are based upon the "desktop metaphor." In a
desktop metaphor system, the display screen is treated as a virtual desktop.
Graphical symbols placed on the virtual desktop (i.e. the display screen) are
used to represent common objects found in an office environment such as
files, file folders, and printers. These desktop metaphor systems have several
limitations which hamper the effectiveness of the man-machine interface
between the human operator and the computer system.One problem with the existing desktop metaphor graphical user
interfaces is the use of a hierarchical file system. Most desktop metaphor
graphical user interfaces are based upon a computer having a file system in
which the computer files are organized in a hierarchical structure. The 
hierarchical file system structure has a root directory and several sub-directories
within the root directory. Each sub-directory may have sub-sub-directories,
and so on. The hierarchical file system structure is graphically
illustrated on the screen as some type of root file cabinet with file folders
inside. The Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh® operating systems
both use hierarchical file systems illustrated as file folders.The hierarchical structure of file folders is often very confusing
to new users. For example, many users get lost while navigating through
hierarchical file systems because the system of keeping files in file folders,
which are in other file folders nested to an arbitrary depth is inherently
confusing. Users become lost because each file folder looks like every other
file folder, and the user is provided with little feedback as to his location
within the file system hierarchy. Also, each file folder provides no
information as to what the file folder contains other than a user-defined label.
For example, except for a short text label, which may have been defined by
another user, the user generally is not able to determine whether an open
folder is an accounting file folder containing spreadsheet data, or a data base
file folder containing a customer data base.

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
(170), said computer system comprising a CPU (30), a memory (33), and graphics

display screen (37), said method comprising the steps of:

providing a plurality of spaces (32, 50, 60 ...), each of said spaces
comprising a graphic background image;
organising said spaces (32, 50, 60 ...) in a directed graph structure, said
spaces connected together with a plurality of portals (47, 48, 49, 52, 54, ...);
- locating said plurality of portals (47, 48, 49 ...) in said spaces (32, 50,
60...), each of said portals having an associated target space such that said portal

connects the space said portal is in with said associated target space, each of
said portals comprising a graphic icon;
rendering a graphic background image of a first space and portals located in said
first space on said graphics display screen, said first space having at least a first

portal;
receiving input from a user, said input comprising a portal selected from
said portals located in said first space; and
rendering a graphic background image of a target space associated with said
selected portal on said graphics display screen (37); such that said user can move

between spaces in said directed graph structure by selecting said portals within
said spaces; and
transferring selected objects in the first space to the target space using a
second portal, said interface conveying state information to the user by animating

a visual appearance of said second portal to catch the users attention.
The method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
(170) as claimed in claim 1, further wherein said steps of rendering a background

image further comprises the steps of:

rendering a first subset of said background image on said graphics display
screen (37), said first subset from a first location in said background image;
receiving directional input from said user, said directional input comprising a
movement direction; and
rendering a second subset of said background image on said graphics
display screen (37), said second subset from a second location in said background

image, said second location being said first location plus an offset corresponding

moves to said first space, said first data structure containing a pointer to said first

space;
popping a second data structure off of said wayback portal stack when said
user selects said wayback portal, said second data structure containing a pointer

to a second space; and
moving said user to said second space pointed to by said pointer in said
second data structure popped off said wayback portal stack;
such that said user can trace back along a path of spaces which said user
travels through.
The method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
(170) as claimed in claim 4, wherein said data structures in said wayback portal

(45) further comprises a coordinate, said coordinate identifying a location in said
first space where said user was when said user left said first space.
The method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
(170) as claimed in claim 4, wherein said wayback portal (45) is rendered
 as a
snapshot of a space pointed to by a pointer in a data structure on top of said

wayback portal stack.
The method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
(170) as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the steps of: 


providing a plurality of button objects (61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69), each of said button
objects associated with a function;
rendering said button objects within said spaces, said button objects
comprising graphic icons; and
executing the function associated with a button object when said button
object is selected by a user.
The method of providing a graphical user interface on a computer system
