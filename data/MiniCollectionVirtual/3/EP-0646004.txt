<DESCRIPTION>
"BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE UREIDO DERIVATIVES USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF LENTIVIRUS-INDUCED DISEASE"The present invention relates to the use of ureido derivatives of substituted pyrroles in the treatment of lentivirus-induced diseases in mammals. The development of compounds useful for the prophylaxis and therapy of viral disease has presented more difficult problems than those encountered in the search of drugs effective ^ disorders produced by other microorganisms. This is typically the case with lentivirus-induced diseases, in particular human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) that as known induce acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a secondary immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from HIV infection.Two closelyrelated viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, have been identified as causing AIDS in different geographic regions. HIV-1 causes most cases of AIDS in the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Central, South and East Africa; HIV-2, which appears less virulent than HIV-1, is the principal agent of AIDS in West Africa. In certain areas of West Africa, both organisms are prevalent. 

AIDS is characterized by opportunistic infections, malignancies, neurological dysfunction and a variety of other syndromes.During the course of the disease, which can be extended over years, the patient is severely debilitated, unable to work or fulfil simple domestic functions. Accordingly, there is a need in therapy for drugs which are active against lentivirus, in particular against human deficiency virus and/or able to ameliorate symptoms of lentivirus-induced disease in a human suffering from lentivirus infection.WO 91/10649 provides ureido derivatives of poly-4- amino-2-carboxyl-l-methylpyrrole compounds which have angiogenesis inhibitor activity and TNF-α neutralizing activity.Accordingly, these prior art compounds can be useful in treating several pathological conditions in mammals where the growth of new blood vessels is detrimental and in which TNF-α is known to play a detrimental role. It has now- been found that a selected class of com¬ pounds previously disclosed in WO 91/10649 are active as anti-lentivirus agents, in particular against HIV. 

Accordingly the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I)
 wherein each of and n, being the same, is' an integer of 1 to 3; and each of the R groups, which are the same, is a naphthyl group substituted by 1 to 3 sulfonic acid groups, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of a human patient
