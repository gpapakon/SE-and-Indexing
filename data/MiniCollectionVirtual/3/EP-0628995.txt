<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
substrate and a method of manufacturing the same. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a semiconductor substrate suitable for 
dielectric isolation, or electronic devices or integrated 
circuits formed on a single-crystal semiconductor layer on 
an insulator. Formation of single-crystal semiconductor layers on an 
insulator is widely known as silicon on insulator (SOI) 
technology. Since devices utilizing SOI technology have 
numerous advantages which cannot be achieved by bulk Si 
substrates from which ordinary Si integrated circuits are 
produced, considerable research has been carried out. By 
utilizing SOI technology, the following advantages can be 
obtained. 
1 ○ dielectric isolation is easy, and high integration is 
possible,  2 ○ high resistance to radiation, 3 ○ floating capacity is reduced and high speed is possible, 4 ○ well step can be omitted 5 ○ latch up can be prevented, and 6 ○ complete-depletion-type field-effect transistor due to 
thin films can be manufactured. To realize the above-described numerous advantages of 
device characteristics, research has been conducted on a 
method of forming an SOI structure. Examples of the most 
advanced SOI structure are an SIMOX (Separation by Ion 
Implanted Oxygen) method and a substrate lamination method. The SIMOX method is a method of forming an SiO₂ layer 
by implanting oxygen ions into an Si single-crystal 
substrate. Since this method conforms well to Si processes, 
this is the most matured method at the present time. 
However, to form an SiO₂ layer, it is necessary to implant 
oxygen ions in an amount of 10¹⁸ ions/cm² or more. The 
implantation time is very long, productivity cannot be said 
to be high, and wafer cost is high. In addition, a great 
amount of crystal defects may be left, and sufficient 
quality at which minority carrier devices can be 
manufactured is not yet achieved from an industrial point of 
view. A substrate lamination method is a simple method of 
forming an SOI substrate by laminating an oxidized  
 
semiconductor substrate with a substrate with a similar 
thermal expansion coefficient. Since the surface 
characteristic of the substrate affects the contact 
characteristic, the surface characteristic need to be 
improved. In the above-described method of manufacturing a 
semiconductor substrate by lamination, lamination strength 
deteriorates due to the surface characteristic of the 
substrate. The surface characteristic means
