<DESCRIPTION>
 LO OXYGEN TRANSMISSIVE FILMThis invention relates to a flexible, multilayer film having low oxygen transmissive characteristics.Certain polymeric films employed for the packaging , 5 of foods inherently permit the transmission of oxygen from the outside of the film to the inside of a package made up of the film. Oxygen permits rapid deterioration of foods packaged in such a container, therefore, its exclusion or control is desired.10 In accordance with the present invention, a film combination comprises a polymeric substrate susceptible of transmitting oxygen, at least one side thereof having been treated to a surface-free energy of at least 35 dynes/cm; at least one treated side having a15 primer coating thereon; and on the primer coating, an oxygen transmission inhibiting layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) containing a cross-linking agent catalyzed with sulfuric acid.The substrates contemplated herein include any20 polymeric film substrate oriented or unoriented which inherently permits the transmission of oxygen and wherein the utility of such film would call for a minimization of the transmission of oxygen. In most cases, the source of the oxygen referred to herein is25 atmospheric oxygen. While nylon, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate, films are contemplated herein, a particularly preferred class of films are the polyolefins. Within the polyolefin class, homopolymers and copolymers of propylene are preferred.30 Particularly preferred are isotactic polypropylenes containing at least 80% by weight of* isotactic polypropylene. The preferred base substrate layer can be homopolypropylene having a melting point* range from 321° to 336°F. A commercially available 35 material of this description is ARCO W472. The preferred substrate can also be coextruded with a thin 

 skin layer, in an amount from 2 to 12% of the total thickness, of a copolymer of propylene and another olefin, e.g., ethylene and/or butene-1. The other olefin can be present in the copolymer in an amount from 1 to 7 wt%.In order to inhibit effectively the amount of oxygen transmitted through the base layer, the base layer must be 1) treated to a surface free energy of at least 35 dynes/cm, 2) have a primer coating applied thereto, and 3) have a coating on the primer of an oxygen transmission inhibiting layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) containing a cross-linking agent catalyzed with sulfuric acid.The preferred substrate must be properly prepared to receive the primer layer followed by the cross- linked poly(vinyl alcohol) .
