analyzed according to the thermal radiation law

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a method for evaluating the 
channel signals of a multichannel pyrometer, including the 
digital processing of output signals of all the channels analyzed 
according to the thermal radiation law: 
L = Ec1 λ-5[exp(c2/λT)-1]-1 
where L is the spectral radiance, E the spectral emissivity of 
the surface whose temperature T should be measured, c1 and c2 
are thermodynamic constants, and λ is the channel wavelength, 
the spectral emissivity E being considered to depend on the 
wavelength according to the function lnE = a + b.f(λ), 
a and b being fitting parameters and f(λ) a suitable function 
of the wavelength, and including an error compensation procedure 
in order to evaluate the true temperature from a variation 
analysis of the different channel signals. Such a method is known from document EP-0 420 108 Al or further document US-A-5 132 922. 
Multichannel pyrometry is receiving an increasing attention 
from both metrology specialists and users from different 
research and industry circles. Since, in principle, multi-channel 
pyrometry makes it possible to determine simultaneously 
both temperature and effective spectral emissivity - no 
matter how the optical absorption of the medium is - the 
potential advantages of this technique are so important, that 
a revolution in the contactless temperature measurements may 
be envisaged in virtue of this method. Yet, the technique, based on analogical-numerical 
fitting of the detected thermal radiation spectrum, presents 
various application problems. Some of them are due to the 
difficulty of predicting, by means of a general, fully 
a-priori functional model (the emissivity spline function), 
the actual trend of the spectral emissivity. Others arise from 
the much higher experimental accuracy which is needed, compared  
 
to conventional pyrometry (when, in the latter case, 
effective emissivity data are available). The progress brought about by microcomputers of 
increasing performance, which can be used for complex on-line 
analysis, makes it possible to solve these problems, and 
enable multichannel pyrometry to evolve towards a self-consistent 
operation method by which external factors, like measurement 
conditions and/or calibration procedures, become less and 
less important. Basically, for the evaluation of temperature from the 
experimentally detected thermal radiation spectrum, the 
emissivity is assumed to be sufficiently a smooth function of 
the wavelength λ representable by a rapidly converging 
Taylor's series which, in
