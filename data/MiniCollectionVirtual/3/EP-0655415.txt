<ABSTRACT>
A device for preparation and supply of hexagonal water is disclosed. 
The device 

circulates the fresh water in an air and increases both hydrogen 
concentration (ph) and 

cation concentration (H⁺) of the water, thus to readily prepare 
the potable hexagonal water 

which is good for the health. A fresh water reservoir (30) is connected 
to a hexagonal water 

reservoir (35) through a connection pipe (32). A water circulation pump 
(38) is placed in the interior 

of the hexagonal water reservoir. The pump circulates the water in the 
hexagonal water 

reservoir so as to make the water contact with the air and changes the 
water into the 

hexagonal water. The pump is controlled by a pump control unit (40) 
placed on the top of the hexagonal water reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to preparation and supply of hexagonal 
water and, more particularly, to a structural improvement in a hexagonal water preparation 
and supply device for more readily preparing and supplying the hexagonal water by 
circulating the fresh water in an air and by increasing both hydrogen concentration (ph) 
and cation concentration (H⁺) of the fresh water. Waters are generally classified in accordance with their molecular structures into 
several types, that is, water of hexagonal ring structure, water of pentagonal ring structure 
and water of five chain structure. General waters include therein all the above three 
molecular structures respectively. However, both the hexagonal ring structure and the 
pentagonal ring structure of the above three molecular structures are basic structures of 
waters. It is noted that the above waters can be changed in their molecular structures by 
the ions resolved therein. For example, the ions, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), 
calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), silver (Ag) and zinc (Zn), generate the hexagonal ring 
structures in the water. On the contrary, the ions, such as potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), 
magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), chlorine (Cl) and cesium (Cs), in the hexagonal water 
destruct the hexagonal ring structure of the water and change the molecular structure into 
the pentagonal ring structure.  When the water comes into contact with the air, carbon dioxide CO₂ of the water 
volatilizes into the air, so that the concentration of carbon dioxide CO₂ of the water is 
reduced, while the cation concentration (H⁺) of the water is increased. At the same time, 
the hydrogen concentration ph of the water is increased. Therefore, the molecular 
structure of the water is changed into the hexagonal ring structure. Generally, portable water include therein the hexagonal ring structure, the 
pentagonal ring structure and the five chain structure. The waters are different from each 
other in their healthful effects in accordance with ratio of the molecular structures 
included in the water. The waters are typically named by their majority structures of the 
three structures. For example, the water whose majority structure is the hexagonal ring 
stnlcture is named as the hexagonal molecular structure water or the hexagonal water, 
while the water whose majority structure is the pentagonal ring structure is named as the 
pentagonal molecular structure water or the pentagonal water. The hexagonal water has 
an excellent healthful
