<ABSTRACT>
The sealing device is intended for tubeless radial spoke 
wheels of the type where the rim (1) is provided with a 

fluting (2) to receive a rubber band (3). The fluting (2) 
substantially has been envisaged as "dovetailed" and fully 

stuffed with the rubber band (3) in a way forming a substantially 
levelled and smoothed top plane with projections 

(5) internally projecting from the rim (1) and making up 
the seat of beads (7) of a tyre (6). Said beads (7) are 

oversized so that they are partially bearing upon the top 
side of the rubber band ends, causing thus, while inflating 

the tyre (6), a pressure of the oversized beads (7) upon 
the rubber band (3), providing whereby a complete tyre sealing 

independently of any flaws, recesses or openings which 
the rim (1) might have.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application refers to a sealing device for 
tubeless tyres mounted on spoke wheels. More particularly, a rim, rubber and tyre unit has been designed 
in the invention, to allow tube removal in the bicycle 
spoke wheels. The Spanish utility model No.8600785 of the same applicant 
is presently already known. This model comprises an improved 
rim profile by which tubeless tyres can be fitted 
in the motorcycle wheels provided with spokes. This is achieved by devising an external peripheral fluting 
located at the profile center and whose defining edges have 
an elastic belt sealingly fitted thereon, sealing the communication 
with the outside through the spoke tensioning nut 
heads. Although said prior registration tries to overcome the problem 
of obtaining bicycle tubeless wheels, there is the 
disadvantage that to be operative, perfectly finished rims 
and also those types of rims obtained by welding of the 
ends to close the ring had to he used. Otherwise, air 
leakages would probably be caused. With the device of this invention, all these disadvantages 
derived from an ill-finished rim, such as internal 
roughness, are fully overcome and this device is also allowing 
to use cost-effective rims, such as those being end-joined 
with dovetailed members, however without any welding. The device being the object of the present invention, because  
 
of its perfect initial sealing also allows the tyre 
to be inflated with the conventional air pump, a thing not 
even possible with the prior system. Essentially, the surprising sealing obtained with the device 
of the present invention is characterised by the fact 
that the sealing between the tyre and the rigidly finished 
rim structure is made by rubber to rubber contact, 
without any other material taking part. Although the device of the invention has mainly been evidently 
designed for bicycle wheels, it is also applicable 
with the same efficiency to any other wheels devised 
to be tubeless and which may have air leakage problems. To arrive at a more detailed description of the invention, 
reference will be made to the attached figure showing a 
preferred embodiment, only by way of a non-exhaustive example. The single figure shows a cross-sectioned profile view of 
the invention unit, wherein a rim 1 is provided with 
a fluting 2, preferably "dovetailed", a rubber band 
3 is housed therein, the top ends 4 of the band being levelled to 
the upper portion of the internal projections 5 of the rim 
1. These internal projections 5 make up the seat
