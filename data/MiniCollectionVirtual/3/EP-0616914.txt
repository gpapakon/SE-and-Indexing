<ABSTRACT>
Each side of an opening in a vehicle roof (10) has 
a longitudinal guide track (22) provided with a drive slide 

(54) and a support slide (30). A panel (40) has a pivot 
pin (36) adjacent its front edge engaging in an inclined 

slot 34 in the support slide. A lift link (62) has its 
upper end pivotally connected to the panel (40) behind the 

pivot pin (36) and its lower end pivotally coupled to the 
support slide (30). A latch slide (44) is slidable along 

the track (22) to hold down the rear edge of the panel 
(40). A coupling link (56) is pivoted by a cam formation 

(72) on the track between a position in which it couples 
the drive slide (54) to the latch slide (44) and a position 

in which it couples the drive slide (54) to the support 
slide (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opening roof assembly 
for a vehicle comprising a stationary guide track provided 
on a side of an opening in a fixed vehicle roof and 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, a 
drive slide arranged to be driven along said guide track, 
a support slide slidably guided in the guide track and 
adapted to be driven by the drive slide, a panel closing 
said opening in said vehicle roof in a closed position and 
being capable of being firstly pivoted about a transverse 
axis adjacent its front edge from its closed position to a 
position in which its rear edge is raised above the fixed 
vehicle roof and then being slidably movable rearwardly 
into positions above the fixed roof, height adjusting means 
coupling the transverse pivot axis to the drive slide, a 
lift link having its upper end pivotally connected to the 
panel at a location behind said transverse pivot axis and 
its lower end pivotally coupled to the support slide, latch 
means slidable along the track into engagement with a 
detent on the panel near its rear edge, and coupling means 
for selectively connecting the latch means to the drive 
slide. EP-A-0296644 discloses an opening roof assembly of 
this type consisting of a large number of parts. It is an 
object of the present invention to provide a simpler 
mechanism. According to the invention, in an opening roof 
assembly of the type described above, the lift link is 
pivotally connected to the panel and the support slide by 
respective pivot joints which allow only relative angular 
movement, and the height adjusting means comprises an 
inclined slot in the support slide which receives a pivot 
pin fast with the panel, the coupling means being arranged 
to prevent movement of the support slide along the track 
when the latch means is connected to the drive means. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:  
 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the top of a 
motor car fitted with an opening roof of the type to which 
the invention relates; Figure 2 is a perspective view of part of the 
mechanism for an opening roof in accordance with the 
invention suitable for mounting on one side of the roof 
opening illustrated in Figure 1; Figure 4 is a side view of a support slide forming 
part of the mechanism shown in Figure 2; Figure 5 is a side view of a pivot lift arm 
forming part of the mechanism shown in Figure 2; Figure 6 is a side view of a lift link forming 
part

<CLAIMS>
An opening roof assembly for a vehicle comprising 
a stationary guide track (22) provided on a side of an 

opening in a fixed vehicle roof (10) and extending in the 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle, a drive slide (54) 

arranged to be driven along said guide track (22), a 
support slide (30) slidably guided in the guide track (22) 

and adapted to be driven by the drive slide (54), a panel 
(40) closing said opening in said vehicle roof (10) in a 

closed position and being capable of being firstly pivoted 
about a transverse axis (36) adjacent its front edge from 

its closed position to a position in which its rear edge is 
raised above the fixed vehicle roof (10) and then being 

slidably movable rearwardly into positions above the fixed 
roof (10), height adjusting means (34) coupling the 

transverse pivot axis (36) to the drive slide (54), a lift 
link (62) having its upper end pivotally connected to the 

panel (40) at a location behind said transverse pivot axis 
(36) and its lower end pivotally coupled to the support 

slide (30), latch means (44) slidable along the track (22) 
into engagement with a detent on the panel (40) near its 

rear edge, and coupling means (56) for selectively 
connecting the latch means (44) to the drive slide (54), 

characterised in that the lift link (62) is pivotally 
connected to the panel (40) and the support slide (30) by 

respective pivot joints (64, 66) which allow only relative 
angular movement, and the height adjusting means comprises 

an inclined slot (34) in the support slide (30) which 
receives a pivot pin (36) fast with the panel (40), the 

coupling means (56) being arranged to prevent movement of 
the support slide (30) along the track (22) when the latch 

means (44) is connected to the drive means. 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 1, 
wherein the coupling means (56) is arranged to disconnect 

the drive slide (54) from the support slide (30) when it is 
coupled to the latch means (44) and to disconnect the drive 

slide (54) from the latch means (44) when it is coupled to  
 

the support slide (30). 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein the coupling means comprises a lever (56) 

pivotally mounted on the drive slide (54) so that a 
projection (58) thereon is movable by a cam formation (76) 

on the track (22) into engagement with an abutment (60) on 
the support slide (30) as a result of rearward movement of 

the drive slide (54). 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 4, 
wherein the abutment on the support slide (30) engaged by 

the projection (58) on the drive slide (54) comprises a 
slot (60) and the track (22) has a flange (73) arranged to 

retain the projection (58) in the slot (60) when the 
support slide (30) is displaced rearwardly. 
An opening roof assembly according to claim 3 or 
4, wherein the projection (58) is movable by a cam 

formation (60) on the support slide (30) into engagement 
with an abutment (48) on the latch means (44) as a result 

of forward movement of the drive slide (54).
