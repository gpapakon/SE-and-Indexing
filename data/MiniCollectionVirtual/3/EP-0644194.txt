<ABSTRACT>
A pyridothiazineacetic acid compound represented by general formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof, a process for producing the same, and a pharmaceutical composition, an aldose reductase inhibitor 

and a preventive and therapeutic agent for the complications of diabetes, wherein each symbol is as defined in the 
specification. The compound and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have an aldose reductase inhibitor activity 

and an excellent stability, and hence they are useful as preventive and therapeutic agents for the complications of 
diabetes, such as faulty union of injured cornea, cataract, neurosis, retinopathy and nephropathy, in particular, cataract 

and neurosis. The invention process serves to produce the above compound efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel pyridothiazineacetic 
acid compound having superior aldose reductase inhibitory 
activity and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, 
production thereof, and pharmaceutical use thereof. The 
compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof are useful as preparations for the prevention and 
treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as diabetic 
cataract, retinopathy, nephropathy and neurosis. Traditionally, blood sugar regulators such as insulin and 
synthetic hypoglycemic agents have been widely used for 
treating diabetes. Diabetes is a disease which accompanies 
various complications which are hardly prevented from 
developing by a mere control of the blood sugar, and a new 
therapeutic agent for the complications of diabetes has been 
demanded. Accumulation of and increase in sorbitol and galactitol in 
tissues which are caused by chronic hyperglycemia have recently 
been drawing attention as the mechanism of the onset of the 
complications of diabetes. Some literatures suggest that a compound having an 
inhibitory action on the activity of aldose reductase which is  
 
an enzyme capable of converting aldose such as glucose or 
galactose into sorbitol or galactitol, is useful for the 
treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as cataract, 
neurosis, nephropathy and retinopathy [see J.H. Kinoshita et al. 
Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 158, 472 (1968), Richard Poulson et al, 
Biochem. Pharmacol., 32, 1495 (1983) and D. Dvornik et al, 
Science, 182, 1145 (1973)]. Based on the foregoing, the study is directed to the 
prevention and treatment of the complications of diabetes by the 
inhibition of aldose reductase activity to ultimately inhibit 
accumulation of polyols such as sorbitol and galactitol. In view of the above, the present inventors have conducted 
intensive studies with the aim of developing a preparation for 
the prevention and treatment of the complications of diabetes, 
which has an aldose reductase inhibitory action, and found that 
a certain pyridothiazine compound achieves the object, which 
resulted in the completion of the invention. That is, the present invention relates to a 
pyridothiazineacetic acid compound of the formula (I) 
wherein
 
 
   X, Y and Z are each independent and either of them is a 
nitrogen atom and the rest is CH,
 
   R¹, R² and R³ may be the same or different and each is a 
hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl or a halogen atom,
 
   R⁴ is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl or a halogen atom,
