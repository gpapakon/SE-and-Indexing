<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of alpha-ketoglutarate or analogues thereof in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of critically ill patients for improving protein synthesis capacity, maintaining energy level, preserving the lean body mass and for improving the glutamine content in skeletal muscle. The medicament contains preferably alpha-ketoglutarate in such an amount, so that it provides more than 0,25g/kg body weight/day of alpha-ketoglutarate, when administered to the patient. The medicament can also comprise conventional amino acid solution and/or glutamine or analogues thereof, L-asparagine and/or acetoacetate. The invention also relates to a composition comprising conventional amino acid mixture and alpha-ketoglutarate or analogues thereof, in such an amount, so that it provides more than 0.25g/kg body weight/day of alpha-ketoglutarate, when administered to the patient, optionally with the addition of glutamine or analogues thereof, L-asparagine and/or acetoacetate, glucose and/or fat.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATEThe present application relates to the use of alpha-ketoglutarate in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of critically ill patients for improving protein synthesis capacity and preserving the lean body mass and for improving the glutamine content and maintaining energy status in skeletal muscle, especially of a medicament containing alpha-ketoglutarate in such an amount, so that it provides more than 0.25 g/kg body weight /day of alpha- ketoglutarate, when administered to the patient.It also relates to a composition containing conventional amino acid mixture and alpha-ketoglutarate in such an amount, so that it provides more than 17,5 g/day, ( 17,5 g/L) of alpha-ketoglutarate, optionally with the addition of glutamine or analogues thereof, glucose and/or fat.The glutamine content in skeletal muscle of critically ill patients ,who are treated with TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) according to common method of today is not influenced by this conventional treatment. Also when glutamine is given additionally in an amount of 20g/day per person, only a moderate influence on the skeletal muscle glutamine of critically ill patients could be established.It must be regarded as surprising that the use of alpha-ketoglutarate has an influence on the glutamine content in skeletal muscle of critically ill patients.Background of the inventionIn states of illness, surgical operations and injuries, profound changes are induced in the energy and protein metabolism of the human body. This means, for example, loss of active cellular mass, leading to muscular fatigue, pronounced apathy and loss of appetite, and a period of convalescence involving general weakness which, for instance after a biliary tract operation, may last 5-6 weeks before the patient has regained his normal function. The cellular mass which is broken down very rapidly in different states of illness 

will need a time for re-establishment which is about four times as long as the time of breakdown for the same mass.In critical states of illness and injuries, parenteral nutritional support is generally applied. In the past, preparations for intravenous nutritional support generally contained an aqueous solution of a high caloric content carbohydrate, such as glucose and the like, fat and electrolytes. In prolonged states of illness or in injuries the nitrogen balance of the body must however be considered, i.e. the ratio of nitrogen loss to nitrogen intake. In the case of negative nitrogen balance, the parenteral
