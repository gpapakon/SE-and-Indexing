<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is the isolation 
of novel proteins and their use in methods to increase 
the probability that mammalian offspring produced by 
it will be of a desired sex or carry a gene for a 
particular sex-chromosome linked trait. This invention 
relates to sorting of sperm cells into X-enriched 
and Y-enriched subpopulations. It further relates 
to the isolation of X-enriched and Y-enriched sperm 
plasma membranes and components thereof. More particularly, 
this invention relates to sex-associated 
membrane proteins and to antibodies which bind to 
them. It relates to the use of these antibodies to 
modify a semen sample so that the semen sample will 
be enriched in X-chromosome bearing sperm cells or 
Y-chromosome bearing sperm cells.  Mammalian semen contains approximately equal 
numbers of Y-chromosome bearing sperm cells (Y-sperm) 
and X-chromosome bearing sperm cells (X-sperm). Fertilization 
of an ovum by a Y-sperm produces a male. 
Fertilization by an X-sperm produces a female. Various methods have been proposed for 
modifying mammalian semen to increase the relative 
percentage of X- or Y-sperm in a semen sample, and 
thereby achieve a greater likelihood of female or male 
offspring. Attempts to influence or control mammalian 
sex have not been verifiable. (For reviews of prior 
research, see Garner, 1984; Pinkel et al., 1985.) One of the more common approaches for 
attempting X-sperm or Y-sperm enrichment in semen 
has relied on motility and density sedimentation. 
(See Kaiser et al., 1974, or Soupart, 1975.) This 
approach is based on the Y-sperm's purported greater 
motility and lighter weight than X-sperm. According 
to the theory, Y-sperm would penetrate an interface 
created at two different media densities more easily 
than X-sperm. One such approach used albumin gradient 
sedimentation. However, due to the morphological 
variability of the maturing sperm, no one has 
independently shown that this technique can separate 
or enrich X-sperm or Y-sperm (Brandriff et al., 1986). Immunological methods have also been tried 
as a means of separating X- and Y-sperm. These 
methods are based on the fact that spermatid RNA 
polymerase is capable of transcribing the haploid 
genome (Moore, 1971). It was believed that X- and 
Y-sperm could be separated immunologically on the 
basis of the different antigens produced from this 
RNA transcript. Antigens investigated in unsexed 
sperm included the LDH isozyme (Stambaugh and  
 
Buckley, 1971). Again, no demonstrable separation 
has been

A method of sorting living sperm cells whose 
DNA content difference is greater than 1% comprising the 

steps of: 

(1) staining living sperm cells with a dye 
which, in response to laser excitation, emits fluorescent 

light in proportion to the amount of DNA in the cell; and 
(2) sorting the sperm cells according to 
their fluorescence with a flow cytometer into subpopulations 

enriched in X-chromosome-hearing sperm cells and Y-chromosome-bearing
