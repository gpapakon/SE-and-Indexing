<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 6-alkyl-4-(pyridin-3-yl-methyleneamino)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one
by reaction between an
aminotriazinone and 3-cyanopyridine under catalytic hydrogenation conditions.6-Methyl-4-(pyridin-3-yl-methyleneamino)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one is a
known insecticide and is also a useful intermediate in the synthesis of insecticidally active
compounds, as described for example in published European patent application EP-A-0
314 615.In EP-A-0 314 615 there is described a process for the preparation of 6-alkyl-4-(pyridin-3-yl-methyleneamino)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one
by the reaction between
pyridine-3-aldehyde and 4-amino-6-alkyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazine in the
presence of catalytic amounts of a strong acid. The disadvantages of this process are the
difficult handling and high price of the pyridin-3-aldehyde.Published PCT application WO 92/02507 describes a two-step process for the synthesis of
imines by the hydrogenation of pyridinecarbonitriles with amines in the presence of a
rhodium-loaded catalyst. There is no mention of hydrazone formation. Addition of a
strong acid, for example HCl, is advocated in order to drive the equilibrium towards
reaction-completion. This has the disadvantage of causing ammonium chloride formation
which, combined with the acidic environment, can lead to fast corrosion and deterioration
of the reaction vessel. Another disadvantage is that the use of rhodium in industrial
production processes is extremely expensive.H. Plieninger and G. Werst report the preparation of aldehyde derivatives from nitriles in
Chem. Ber. 88, p.1956 to 1961 (1955). Semicarbacides are used as starting materials, and
the reaction conditions include relatively large amounts of Raney-nickel catalyst and high
hydrogen pressure. Furthermore poor yields are achieved. In contrast to Plieninger et al.
the present invention uses a cyclic carbacide as starting material, smaller amounts of 
catalyst and lower hydrogen pressure.There is a need for a more economical and ecologically acceptable process. The
disadvantages of the known processes include low selectivity, poor yields and corrosion of
the production vessels.Surprisingly it has now been found that 6-alkyl-4-(pyridin-3-yl-methyleneamino)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-one
can be prepared directly in a one-pot reaction between an
aminotriazinone, namely 4-amino-6-alkyl-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazine, and
3-cyanopyridine in high yield, high
