<ABSTRACT>
A transport-by-suction type die for use in a working 
machine having working stages, the die comprises a feed arm 

mounted in a position above the working stage in a lower part 
of the die to be slidable in the direction of consecutive feed 

and to be vertically movable with respect to a surface of the 
working stage; suction pads for supporting a piece part by 

suction the suction pads being attached to the feed arm at the 
same interval as that of the working stages; a negative-pressure 

aspiration mechanism conneced with each of the suction 
pads; and a drive control mechanism for causing the feed arm to 

move vertically and reciprocate in synchronism with working 
processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transport-by-suction
type die for use in a lead working machine useful in the
fabrication of semiconductor devices.The fabrication of plastic-molded semiconductor devices
includes the steps of placing semiconductor chips on to
leadframes, molding them with plastics and performing the
necessary working processes such as resin removal, dam bar
cutting, lead tip cutting and lead forming. The lead working
machine is used at this post-die-processing stage to perform
lead forming and various other working steps.The lead working machine is usually operated with more
than one die. The working operation is performed in two
different ways: in one case, the leadframe is worked as it is
transported in a strip form and piece parts are separated from
it at the final stage and in the other case, lead cutting and
dam bar cutting are first conducted and then the product
portions are separated as piece parts from the leadframe and
transported to the bending step. The primary reason for
adopting these two different methods of transport is as
follows: in the case where the leadframe is transported in a 
strip form, a simple transport apparatus will do since the top
and bottom rails of the leadframe can be utilized as transport
guides; however, with product portions that are not suspended
from the top and bottom rails by means of hanger pins (i.e.,
pinch leads for suspending the packages) or with products that
are suspended by means of hanger pins but which may drop during
transport owing to the insufficient strength of the pins,
transport of the leadframe for bending or otherwise working the
leads is sometimes impossible unless it is separated into piece
parts.Figs. 19, 20 and 21 are illustrations showing the
layout of a prior art lead working machine. Fig. 19 shows an
apparatus that performs working processes up to the bending
stage as a leadframe in a strip form is fed consecutively with
pins inserted into the rail holes in the leadframe. In this
apparatus, the leadframe generally indicated by 5 is worked as
it is supplied from the left side of the apparatus into a first
die 7 and a second die 8 on a platform 6. A feed unit 10 which
allows the leadframe to be fed consecutively with pins inserted
into the rail holes is positioned parallel to the train of
dies. In the final step following the bending process, piece
parts 11 are separated from the product, transported from the
second die and replaced in a receiving portion 12. The
unwanted frame which remains after the separation of piece

<CLAIMS>
A transport-by-suction type die for sucking a
workpiece as a piece part and for working the workpiece as it

is fed consecutively, said die comprising:

guide means for supporting said piece part, said guide
means being movably provided on a surface of said die movable forward

and backward in a direction of consecutive feed and being
vertically movable to approach or depart from the surface of

said die;
means for moving said guide means forward and backward;
and
means for vertically moving said guide means.
A transport-by-suction type die for use in a
working machine, the die having working stages, said die comprising:


a feed arm (112) mounted in a position above the working
stage in a lower part of said die to be slidable in the

direction of consecutive feed and to be vertically movable with
respect to a surface of the working stage;
suction pads (114) for supporting a piece part by suction
said suction pads being attached to said feed arm at the same

interval as that of said working stages;
a negative-pressure aspiration mechanism connected with
each of said suction pads; and 
a drive control mechanism for causing said feed arm to
move vertically and reciprocate in synchronism with working

processes.
A transport-by-suction type die as claimed in
claim 2, further comprising support plates (112a) on which said

suction pads are provided, said support plates being positioned
in space areas between adjacent working stages that will not

interfere with the working operation.
A transport-by-suction type die as claimed in
claim 3, wherein said feed arm is formed as a frame-like

element which defines rectangular openings in areas that will
correspond to the working stages during a working process and

the support plates of the feed arm will be positioned in space
areas between adjacent working stages that will not interfere

with the working operation.
A transport-by-suction type die as claimed in
claim 2, further comprising a feed drive mechanism provided

exterior of said die for allowing said feed arm to move
forward and backward in the direction of consecutive feed.
A transport-by-suction type die as claimed in
claim 5, further comprising a guide for supporting said arm in

a direction parallel to the direction of consecutive feed and
on a lateral surface of the opposite side of the lower part of said die;

   wherein said feed arm comprises a sub-arm (112b) which extends
toward the opposite side of the lower part of said die, and a 

butt block (122) that is to be pushed by said feed drive mechanism so
as to reciprocate said feed arm by said feed drive mechanism.
