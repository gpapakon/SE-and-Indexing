<ABSTRACT>
A fodder distributor with a mounting frame attachable to the three-point suspension of a tractor and with a horizontal distributor roller (9) centrally mounted on the mounting frame is described. So that silage blocks can also be comminuted and distributed in addition to green fodder, it is proposed that a clearing and/or carrying arrangement engaging under the distributor roller (9) be guided so as to be freely vertically movable on the mounting frame, specifically particularly by means of double levers (34). If the fodder distributor has only a clearing plate, it is expedient to support the mounting frame relative to the fodder table via a roller. If a carrying fork (35) is provided as a vertically movable arrangement, this can be made to run on the fodder table on rollers (39). The distributor roller (9) is preferably pivotable upwards by means of a pivoting frame (31), which is driven by a hydraulic cylinder (30). The pivoting movement can also be utilised to lift the carrying fork (35) by means of a pull cord (43).

Feed distributor comprising an attachment frame (3) that can be 
mounted on the three-point suspension of a tractor and a 

horizontal distributor roll (9), journalled centrally on this 
frame and consisting of two drums equipped with guide blades 

(10), wherein the guide blades (10) are so disposed in the form 
of a plurality of imaginary helical turns on the drums (47, 48) 

that the mutually corresponding guide blades of the individual 
helical turns are aligned in the circumferential direction and 

that all the guide blades of one drum are spaced apart 
circumferentially by equal angles of arc, characterized in that 

the guide blades have a leading part (70), ascending steeply 
from the cylindrical surface of the drum to a specific radial 

maximum height, and a following part (71), as considered in the 
rotational direction, which has this maximum height throughout 

and falls away steeply at the end. 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
inner guide blades immediately adjacent to the centre of the 

distributor roll are disposed with their leading part (73) at 
the edge of the drum in the radial plane and the following parts 

(74), having maximum height, are angled relative to the leading 
parts towards the other guide blades. 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that, on 
the under side of the bearing assembly of the distributor roll, 

a guide body is mounted between the drums, which possesses a 
guide surface inclined to a radial plane of the drums. 
Feed distributor according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
bearing assembly is surrounded by an annular sleeve (49), 

covering the gap between the drums (47, 48), and that a ring 
segment (46) of wedge-shaped cross-section is mounted as guide 

body on this sleeve.  
 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that 
extension blades (53) are provided, which can be screwed on to 

the outer guide blades and extend them beyond the width of the 
tractor. 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
clearing and/or carrying assembly (24; 35), resting on the 

ground and penetrating beneath the distributor roll, is guided 
freely movable in height on the attachment frame (3). 
Feed distributor according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
clearing and/or carrying assembly is guided substantially 

parallel with respect to the attachment frame by means of a 
plurality of pivoting levers (26, 27; 37). 
Feed distributor according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the attachment frame, on which a clearing shield (23, 24, 

25) is guided freely movable in height, is limited in its 
downward movement by rollers (21) running on the ground. 
Feed distributor according to one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that a horizontal silage block carrying fork 

(35) is guided freely movable in height on the attachment frame, 
and is limited in its downward movement by rollers (39), mounted 

on it and running on the ground. 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
distributor roll is mounted pivotally upwards and downwards on 

the attachment frame by means of a fork-like pivoting frame (31) 
and can be adjusted to a desired pivoted position by means of a 

hydraulic cylinder (30).  
 
Feed distributor according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in 
that the silage block carrying fork (35) is connected by means 

of a pulling rope (43) to the pivoting frame (31) and in this 
way, as the latter is pivoted upwards beyond a specific pivoted 

position, can be lifted off the ground. 
Feed distributor according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
distributor roll has a bearing assembly comprising a T-gear (6) 

and a support sleeve (61) firmly connected to the gear casing 
and through which a drive shaft (66) passes, and that the 

support sleeve is rotatably journalled through 180Â° and able to 
be locked in a support tube (60) forming a part of the 

attachment frame or the pivoting frame.
