<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
prevention of disease in cattle. More particularly, the
instant invention is directed to the recombinant
production of certain bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1)
antigens especially a truncated BHV-1 gIV antigen, for
use in vaccines to protect cattle against bovine
herpesvirus type 1 infection.Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is an economically
significant pathogen of cattle. BHV-1, which is
also known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus,
causes severe respiratory infections, conjunctivitis,
vulvovaginitis, abortions, encephalitis, and generalized
systemic infections. If an animal recovers from a
primary infection, the virus rains in the host in a
latent state. Reactivation of the virus can be provoked
by certain endogenous or exogenous physical modifications
in the animal, or experimentally by treatment of the
animal with glucocorticoids like dexamethasone.In an effort to control BHV-1 infections, killed
virus and attenuated live-virus vaccines have been
developed. While these vaccines appear to induce some
level of protection in cattle, the level of immunity is
well below that necessary to afford complete or 
near-complete protection. For example, the vaccines do
not always prevent the establishment of a latent
infection by a virulent field strain of BHV-1.
Furthermore, the safety of the live-virus vaccines has
been questioned. It has been shown recently that two
live BHV-1 vaccine strains can be reactivated by the use
of dexamethasone, indicating that at least some BHV-1
vaccines can themselves establish a latent infection.

47:133-139; Pastoret et al. (1980) Infect. Immun.
29:483-488. Subunit vaccines, i.e. vaccines including
select proteins separated from the whole virus, afford a
method for overcoming the problems inherent in the use of
live and attenuated virus vaccines.Several polypeptides of BHV-1 have now been
studied. Misra et al. (1981) J. Virol. 40:367-378,
reports on the partial characterization of a number of
BHV-1 polypeptides and their immunoprecipitation with
antiserum. van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al. (1984)
Virology 135:466-479 and van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk
et al. (1985) Virology 144:216-227 are directed to
monoclonal antibodies developed against BHV-1
glycoproteins, and the ability of the monoclonal
antibodies to neutralize virus and participate in
antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis in vitro.
