<ABSTRACT>
An endoscopic suturing device, comprising an elongate hollow tube (10) one end of which carries a combination of a thread engaging and loop forming member (18) and a thread or needle clamping member (11). An actuating member (12) at the other end of the tube (10) engages an elongate actuating rod (15) extending through the tube and is coupled to the thread or needle clamping member, whereby axial movement of the actuating member against the biasing action of a rail spring (21) causes said actuating rod to actuate said thread or needle clamping member. The device is capable of disassembling for cleaning and sterilisation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to endoscopic suturing and
in particular a device or instrument for forming knots to
tie tissue together in cavities within animal (human)
bodies to complete internal surgical procedures.It has become practice with certain surgical
procedures within cavities in the human body to avoid over
intrusive surgical techniques, involving large incisions to
gain access to body cavities, to now use a surgical
technique known as endoscopy where relatively small
incisions are made through to the body cavity and surgical
procedures are carried out using an endoscope being an
elongate device or instrument in the nature of a telescope
inserted thorough the incision to view the area where
surgery is being carried out, whilst a similar elongate
device or instrument is used to severe internal body tissue
during various types of tissue removal or repair
operations. By using such a less intrusive surgical
technique involving small incisions patient trauma is kept
to a minimum resulting in a lesser term of hospitalisation
and keeping scaring to a minimum.However one of the major difficulties with such a
surgical technique arises when it is necessary to suture
internal body tissue by stitching the tissue together using
thread like material, which requires the formation of knots
within the body cavity as distinct from externally
accessible areas where suturing external body tissue is
involved.One presently used technique involves the use of
clips or clamps which clamp the body tissue together and
which are applied within the body cavity using an elongate
clip applicator inserted through one of the external
incisions whilst the viewing the application of the clip
with the endoscope through another external incision. 
However, some such clips are not designed to be dissolved
over a period of time whilst the joined body tissue heals
and as a result are relatively expensive adding
significantly to the cost of the surgical procedure.One other known intracorporal suturing technique
involves the use of a pair of instruments one being in the
form a pair suture grasping forceps and a separate knotting
device, and involves inserting the suture (thread) through
the tissue to be joined using a needle holder and
thereafter holding one free end of the thread with the
needle holder whilst through a separate incision the
knotting device is inserted to catch the thread between the
needle holder and the tissue whereby by rotating the
knotting device through one or more rotations of 180Â°, one
or more loops are formed in

<CLAIMS>
An endoscopic suturing device comprising:

an elongate hollow tube (10;10'), a fixed jaw member
(11d;11d') and a movable jaw member (11;11') supported

adjacent said fixed jaw member at one end of said tube, and
means operable at the other end of said tube for actuating

the movable jaw member, 
characterised in that
:

(a) a thread engaging and loop forming member
(18;18') is provided in the form of a spiral hook integral

with said movable jaw member; and
(b) said means for actuating said movable jaw member
comprises an actuating member (12;12') engaging a single

elongate actuating rod (15;15') extending through said tube
and coupled to said movable jaw member, whereby axial

movement of said actuating member causes said actuating rod
to actuate said movable jaw member.
An endoscopic suturing device according to claim 1,
wherein an axial movement of said actuating

member and said actuating rod causes said movable jaw
member to move to a non-clamping position.
An endoscopic suturing device according to claim 2,
wherein a biasing means (21) is provided between the

actuating member and the adjacent end of the elongate tube
to bias the movable jaw member (11) to a clamping position. 
An endoscopic suturing device according to claim 1,
wherein an axial movement of said actuating

member and said actuating rod causes said movable jaw
member to move to a clamping position.
An endoscopic suturing device according to claim 4,
wherein means are provided to hold said movable jaw member

in said clamping position.
An endoscopic suturing device according to claim 5,
wherein said means for holding said movable jaw member in

said clamping position includes matingly engageable saw
tooth configurations (51,52) which are moved with respect

to one another by said axial movement of said actuating
member (12') and said actuating rod (15').
An endoscopic suturing device according to any
preceding claim, wherein the connections between the

actuating rod and the actuating member are detachable so
that the device can be disassembled to allow cleaning and

sterilisation of its various components.
An endoscopic suturing device according to any
preceding claim, wherein the connections between the

actuating rod and the movable jaw member are detachable so
that the device can be disassembled to allow cleaning and

sterilisation of its various components.
