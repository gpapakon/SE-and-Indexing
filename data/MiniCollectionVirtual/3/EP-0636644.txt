<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a self-reinforcing composite 
system, wherein a blend of a polyolefin and a liquid crystalline 

polymer (LCP), the polyolefin having a melt temperature which is 
lower than the solid-nematic phase transition temperature of the 

LCP, is subjected to processing under shear at a temperature which 
is 1 to 10 °C higher than the solid-nematic phase transition 

temperature of the LCP. The composite leaves the processing 
equipment under elongational stress and is immediately quenched.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of self-reinforcing composite systems. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a process for preparing a 
self-reinforcing composite system comprising a thermoplastic 
polymer and a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP). In POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE, mid-May 1990, Vol. 30, 
No. 9, pp. 532-542 blends of thermotropic liquid crystalline 
polymers (TLCP) with on the one hand polystyrene (PS) and on the 
other hand a mixture of polystyrene and polyphenylene ether 
(PS/PPE) were investigated on their morphology, orientation and 
resulting mechanical properties. Compounding of the components was 
performed in an extruder at processing temperatures between 290 and 
320 °C, where the TLCP is in the liquid crystalline or nematic 
phase. The strand leaving the extruder was directly quenched in a 
water bath, air-dried and chopped into granulate for further 
processing. Alternatively, strands were collected from the extruder 
at two different haul-off speeds. Further processing of the 
granulate involved the spinning into fibres, which was concluded to 
be a successful method of elongational deformation in order to 
induce fine fibrils with high aspect ratios. The mechanical 
properties, i.e. modulus and strength, were shown to increase at 
increasing TLCP contents, while elongational deformation was 
concluded to be very important for obtaining fibrillar structures 
with the corresponding good mechanical properties. U.S. Patent No. 5,006,402 discloses a self-reinforced polymer 
composite comprising 5-60% by weight of a thermoplastic polymer 
having a melting point of at least 200 °C and 95-40% by weight of a 
melt processable aromatic polyester, which is a LCP. Said 
thermoplastic polymer serves as a matrix for the said polyester,  
 
which is present in the form of unidirectionally oriented fibres 
formed in situ in said matrix. In a process for preparing such 
polymer composites the thermoplastic polymer and the aromatic 
polyester are dry blended and thoroughly mixed at a temperature 
above the melting points of both polymers, suitably 300-400 °C, in 
a suitable mixing apparatus which will give thorough high strain 
mixing sufficient to cause fibre formation. An example of a 
suitable mixing apparatus is a single screw extruder in series with 
a static mixer and extrusion die. The hot blend leaving the mixing 
apparatus is subsequently quenched, and, if extruded in the form of 
a strand, after solidification chopped into pellets.
