<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel Maillard
reaction inhibitor.The Maillard reaction is a reaction which starts in a
living body with an attack by a nucleophilic reaction with a
free amino group present in a protein on an aldehyde group of
a reducing sugar such as glucose to from a Schiff base which
is called aldimine. Then, aldimine successively cause a
rearrangement to form a more stable Amadori compound (non-enzymatic
glycation). The Amadori compound further causes a
series of reaction with other proteinous amino groups,
thereby to form a brown fluorescent material and to cause a
crosslinking between proteins. Historically, Maillard
reported in 1912 that a mixed solution of an amino acid and a
reducing sugar, when heated, is colored into brown (L. C.
Maillard, Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol., 72, 599 (1912)) and, since
then, the reaction is called Maillard reaction. At that
time, Maillard already suggested that the reaction could
occur in a living body.In 1968, Rabber et al found that hemoglobin A1c which
is a very small fraction of hemoglobin is increased in the
blood of diabetic patients (S. Rabber et al, Clin. Chim.
Acta.,22, 296 (1968)) and further, it was found that the 
hemoglobin A1c was formed by bonding glucose to the N
terminal valine of the hemoglobin β-chain in the form of an
Amadori rearrangement (V. J. Stevens, H. Vlassara, A. Abati,
& A. Cerami, J. Biol. Chem.,252, 2998 (1977)), etc., and the
occurrence of a non-enzymatic glycation in a living body was
proved.Recently, it has been confirmed that various
bioproteins may undergo the Maillard reaction. For example,
it is reported that the amount of hemoglobin subjected to a
glycation is increased thrice in a diabetic (E. C. Abraham et
al, J. Lab. Clin. Med.,102, 187 (1983)).Also, it is reported that the amount of glycation is
increased in the serum albumin of diabetic patients (R.
Dolhofer and O. H. Wieland, Diabetes,29, 417 (1980)). Also,
it is reported that fluorescence is increased in the skin
collagen obtained from diabetic patients (Vincent M. Monnier
et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 81, 583 (1984)).The non-enzymatic glycation is a phenomenon observed
in a healthy person, but the accumulation of the brown
fluorescent material is a protein having a delayed metabolic
turnover rate and is markedly observed in aging and a
diabetic state of increasing a blood sugar value. The reason
therefor has been reported by Patrick et al that an
accumulated amount of the Maillard reaction product is
determined by a blood sugar value, the metabolic
