Process for the recycling of plastisols which 
consist of synthetic material powders which are 

dispersed in a plasticiser and are possibly mixed 
with stabilisers, filling materials and other 

adjuvants and are present as waste of a coating 
process on a coating protection agent, characterised 

in that the plastisol is washed off from the 
protection agent with a solvent boiling between 35 

and 80°C, separated from foreign particles and 
possibly agglomerated synthetic material particles 

and the solvent is distilled off at a temperature 
of below 50°C. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the distillation is carried out in a vacuum 

at 5 to 500 HPa. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that, as solvent, there is used a 

lower alkane or a mixture of alkanes with a boiling 
point between 40 and 70°C. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that foreign bodies and 

agglomerated particles are separated off by sieving 
off in a sieve with a mesh breadth of 
<
 150 µm. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the protection agents are 

purified by repeated washing and returned to the 
production process.
