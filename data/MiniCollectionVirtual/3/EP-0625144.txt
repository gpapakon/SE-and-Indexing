<DESCRIPTION>
 Pyridone derivatives, their preparation and use as medicinesThe present invention relates to novel substituted pyridylamidine derivatives, processes for their preparation, intermediates useful in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in therapy, in particular as gastric acid secretion inhibitors.The present invention, therefore, provides in a first aspect, compounds of structure (I) :in which Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring;Ar 2 i.s an optionally substituted phenyl ring;1 .R is hydrogen or Ci-^alkyl;R 2 i.s hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl;R 3 i.s hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl; R 4 and R5 are the same or different and are each hydrogen, Cι_4alkyl or Cι_4alkylAr 1, or R4 and R5 together form a group (CH=CH)2; and6 _X is CH2 or NR in which R is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl and salts thereof.Suitably, Ar is an optionally substituted phenyl ring. Suitable substituents for the phenyl ring Ar include, for example, C^-galkyl, Cj-galkoxy, C^-galkylthio, halogen, cyano, amino, Ci-^alkylamino, diC1_4alkylanri.no, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, Ci-galkanoyl trifluoromethyl, and Cι_4alkylenedioxy substituents such as methylenedioxy (-OCH2O-) . The phenyl ring may be substituted by a single 

substituent, or by up to 5 substituents such as may be1 synthetically accessible. Preferably, the group Ar is unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from C^-galkyl, C^-galkoxy, C^_ galkylthio, halogen, cyano, amino, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, Cχ_galkanoyl or trifluoromethyl. More preferablyAr is unsubstituted phenyl, or phenyl substituted by a single substituent selected from C__galkyl, C^-galkoxy or halogen.Suitably, Ar 2 is an optionally substituted phenyl ring.2Suitable substituents for the phenyl ring Ar include, for example, C^-galkyl, C^-galkoxy, C^-galkylthio, halogen, cyano, amino, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, C^-galkanoyl trifluoromethyl, and Cι_4alkylenedioxy substituents such as methylenedioxy (-OCH2O-) . The phenyl ring may be substituted by a single substituent, or by up to 5 substituents such as may be synthetically accessible.2 Preferably, the group Ar is unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from Cι_galkyl,Cι_galkoxy, C^-galkylthio, halogen, cyano, amino, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, C^-galkanoyl or trifluoromethyl.
