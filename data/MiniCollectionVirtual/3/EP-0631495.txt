<ABSTRACT>
An improved reflex gun (21) is adapted to measure certain parameters of a stimulus supplied to a tendon, and the patient's response thereto. The gun has a trigget (29) which, when squeezed, supplies a signal to a computer (24). The computer then causes a waveform generator (32) to provide current pulses of desired magnitude, shape and duration to a solenoid (50) in the gun. Such energization of the solenoid coil, causes a plunger (52) to impact against one end of a force sensor (22). The other end of the force sensor is held against the patient's skin with a preload force sufficient to measure the patient's response to a force stimulus. The force sensor has a transducer (132) for measuring the certain parameters of the impact force and the patient's response. The improved device may be used to determine quantitatively certain parameters of the stimulus and response, and provides a diagnostic tool for a physician.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REFLEX MEASURING DEVICE, AND METHODTechnical FieldThe present invention relates generally to reflex measuring devices and methods for determining the physical reflex response of a patient to a supplied stimulus, and, more particularly, to an improved method and apparatus for sensing and measuring quantitatively certain parameters of the patient's response to such a stimulus.Background ArtPhysicians commonly attempt to determine the existence vel non of a patient's muscular response to an applied stimulus, by means of a rubber hammer. Basically, the physician taps a tendon through the skin, and then looks for an involuntary physical response. For example, to test the reaction of the quadricep muscle, the physi¬ cian will typically ask the patient to first cross his legs while sitting on an examination table. The physician will then tap the quadricep tendon beneath the skin in the vicinity of the knee, and will then look for an involuntary knee-jerk reaction. Upon information and belief, such impulse tapping of this tendon causes the quadricep muscle to contract, causing the involuntary knee-jerk reaction. This technique is also generally used to test the muscular response to a stimulus applied to the achilles tendon, the bicep tendon, the tricep tendon, the brachii radialis, the hamstrings, and the jaw tendons.Upon information and belief, some physicians have physically placed their finger(s) against the tendon, and have tapped their fingers with the tap hammer. Thus, the impact force transmitted from the hammer to the finger(s) is transmitted through the fingers and the patient's skin to the tendon itself. This technique is believed to permit the physician to "feel" the patient's response, rather than to rely solely on visual observa¬ tion. In either case, the use of such data has heretofore been limited, and is necessarily subjective. Such data is usually limited to determining whether the patient exhibits a response, or not.After the stimulus has been applied (i.e., the tendon has been tapped), the impact stimulus must be transmitted along various afferent (sensory) nerves to the spinal cord, must traverse at least one electrochemical synapse to excite the cell bodies of the motor neurons in the cord and to transmit the resulting action potentials from the cord to the muscle membranes along efferent (motor) fibers, must cross the electrochemical 

neuro uscular junction, and must conduct the resulting action potentials along the muscle membranes to the myofibrils where mechanical contraction occurs.
