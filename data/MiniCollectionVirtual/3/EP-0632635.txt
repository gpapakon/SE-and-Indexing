<ABSTRACT>
An intelligent emergency call system (ESYS) is proposed. This has wire-connected (EW) and wireless emergency call transmitting devices (ER1, ER2) which in each case contain a card reader (CI) which reads an identifier and personal and medical emergency call data (EDAT) from a patient's chip card (CC). The read emergency call data are transmitted in an emergency call message (EMES), e.g. via a telephone network (TN), a power supply network (PN) or a mobile radio network (RN) to at least one emergency call receiving device (R) and/or a rescue control centre (EC). Specific aid measures can thereby be instigated. The wireless emergency call transmitting device can be designed as a single unit or an add-on module for a radio unit. The emergency call system is suitable for the protection of people and property (buildings, transports etc.).

Emergency call system (ESYS):

having a transmission network (TN, PN; RN) which provides at least one message
channel;
having at least one emergency call transmission device (EW; ER2) which is suitable
for reading emergency call data (EDAT) and an identity identification (PIN) of the

emergency caller from a memory card (CC) by means of a card reader (CI), and for
sending these together in an emergency call message (EMES) on the message

channel, and
having at least one emergency call reception device (R), which is suitable for
receiving and evaluating the emergency call message (EMES), in order to trigger at

least one alarm function (A, V, L), and/or for forwarding the emergency call data
(EDAT) to an alarm centre (EC), which is connected to the transmission network (TN,

PN; RN);
characterised in that
 the emergency call transmission device (EW, ER2) contains a
signal-processing part (BB), which is suitable for linking the emergency call message

(EMES) to a respective identification (I1, I2, I3, I4), which corresponds to a predefined
alarm category and which determines the alarm functions (A, L, V) to be triggered.
Emergency call system (ESYS)

according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the transmission network is an electrical
power-supply network (PN) having predefined message channels.
Emergency call transmission device (EW; ER2)

for an emergency call system (ESYS), which contains a transmission network (TN, PN;
RN) which provides at least one message channel;
having a card reader (CI) which is suitable for reading emergency call data (EDAT;
EDAT-, EDAT+) from a memory card (CC);
having a signal-processing part (BB), which is arranged downstream of the card
reader (Cl) and is suitable for creating an emergency call message (EMES) by means

of the emergency call data, and 
having a transmission part (TX), which is arranged downstream of the signal-processing
part (BB) and is suitable for transmitting the emergency call message

(EMES) on the message channel,
characterised in that

the signal-processing part (BB) is suitable for linking the emergency call message
(EMES) to a respective identification (I1, I2, I3, I4), which corresponds to a predefined

alarm category and which determines the alarm functions (A, L, V) to be triggered.
Emergency call transmission device (ER2)

according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the emergency call transmission device is
a wireless emergency call transmission device (ER2) for a wireless

telecommunications network (RN) having predefined radio channels, in particular for
a service or mobile radio system,
in that
 the signal-processing part (BB) is connected for position determination to a
satellite radio receiver (SAT), which is suitable for determining the current position

data (POS), and 
in that
the signal-processing part (BB) is suitable for linking the emergency call message
(EMES) to these position data (POS).
Emergency call transmission device (ER2) according to Claim 4, 
characterised
by
 a portable housing (PH) which has a carrying frame (CB) and an antenna (A)
integrated therein.
Emergency call transmission device (EW, ER2)

according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the memory card (CC) is a patient chip
card on which a patient's medical data are stored, and 
in that
 the card reader (CI) is
suitable for reading the medical data as emergency call data (EDAT) in order to

create the emergency call message (EMES).
Emergency call transmission device (EW, ER2)

according to Claim 3, 
characterised by
 switching means (S1, S2, S3, S4), which are
connected to the signal-processing part (BB) and by means of which the signal-processing

part is suitable for linking the emergency call message (EMES) to the 
respective identification (I1, I2, I3, I4), which corresponds to the predefined alarm

category and which determines the alarm functions (A, L, V) to be triggered.
