<ABSTRACT>
The digging tooth has a tooth holder (1), on one end of which a wedge-shaped tooth nose (3) is integrally formed. The tooth nose (3) is the support for a wedge-shaped tooth cap (5) in which a wedge-shaped hollow space (24) is recessed. When the tooth cap (5) is mounted, the hollow space (24) is pushed onto the tooth nose (3), which thus supports the tooth cap (5). For a good bearing arrangement, the wedge surfaces (8, 9) of the tooth nose (3) have radii of curvature convexly arched perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis (16) and continuously decreasing from the tooth edge (7) to the nose root (17). Accordingly, the wedge surfaces (25, 26) of the hollow space (24) have concavely arched radii of curvature of the same magnitude continuously decreasing from the bottom (28) to the mouth (29) of the hollow space (24). The tooth cap (5) thereby bears on the tooth nose (3) over a large area. A locking pin serves to secure the tooth cap (5). The locking pin passes through the bores (20, 34) in the tooth nose (3) and in the side faces of the tooth cap (5) and holds the same in place.

Digging tooth for attachment to the shovel 
edge of a digger shovel, which comprises a tooth 

holder (1) having a wedge-shaped tooth projection (3) 
intended to protrude beyond the shovel edge and a 

wedge-shaped tooth cap (5) which can be slipped over 
the tooth projection (3) and is securable thereon, 

said tooth projection (3) comprising two wedge faces 
(8, 9 ) situated opposite a longitudinal axis (16) 

and defined by lateral faces (10, 11), and said tooth 
cap (5) comprising a cavity (24), which is defined by 

lateral faces (32, 33) and has wedge faces (25, 26) 
identical to the wedge faces (8, 9) of the tooth 

projection (3), characterised in that the wedge faces 
(8, 9, 25, 26) are defined by a circular profile 

(15) over their width in sections (Figs. 3, 4, 7) 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (16), the 

radius (R) of which profile decreases continuously in 
a direction in opposition to the tooth holder (1), and 

a guide web is disposed on the tooth projection (3) in 
the central region of the wedge faces (8, 9, 25, 

26), parallel to the longitudinal axis (16), and a  
 

longitudinal groove (30) is provided in the cavity 
(24) of the tooth cap (5) to accommodate said web, 

a bore (20, 34) being provided, for the securement of 
the tooth cap (5), in the lateral faces (10, 11, 32, 

33) for the insertion of a securing bolt, at a 
spacing from the opening (29) of the cavity (24) in or 

parallel to the central plane (12) of the wedge faces 
(8, 9, 25, 26). 
Digging tooth according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the radius (R) of the circular 

profile (15) changes in the ratio 1 : 1.38....1.64, 
preferably 1 : 1.5. 
Digging tooth according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the longitudinal groove (30) for 

accommodating the guide web (18) flattens towards the 
opening (29) of the cavity (24) and terminates in the 

wedge faces (25, 26).  
 
Digging tooth according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the spacing between the bore, 

(20, 34) and the opening (29) of the cavity (24) 
amounts to substantially one-third of the overall 

length of the cavity (24).
