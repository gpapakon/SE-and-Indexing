Pump station for tyres having a frame for carrying at 
least one tyre and having an inflating apparatus which is 

connected by way of connections with at least one compressed 
air source and with an electrical control unit, characterised 

in that
 
the frame (1) is constructed as a polygonal housing (7)
 
rotatable about a vertical centre line (6) and
 
tyres can be carried standing next to the side surfaces (8, 9, 

10, 11) of the polygonal housing (7), and at least one of the 
tyres (2) carried next to a side surface (8) of the polygonal 

housing (7) can be connected to the inflating apparatus (3). 
Pump station according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the polygonal housing (7) is constructed as a truncated 

pyramid, at least one support element (13, 14) for a tyre being 
respectively provided in the lower region (12) of the truncated 

pyramid. 
Pump station according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the truncated pyramid is traversed by a central axle (16) 

arranged on the vertical centre line (6) and surrounding a 
shaft (15) standing on the vertical centre line, and that the 

central axle (16) and the shaft (15) project beyond the lower 
region of the truncated pyramid, the shaft (15) being secured 

to a stationary frame (17). 
Pump station according to claim 3, characterised in that 
at least two bearings (18, 19) are arranged between the 

shaft (15) and the central axle (16). 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the central axle (16) is constructed as a 

square tube and is connected in the upper and lower regions by 
way of struts (20, 21) with the respective inner walls (22) of 

the polygonal housing (7) constructed like a truncated pyramid. 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that each side surface (8, 9, 10, 11) of the 

truncated pyramid has a locking means associated with it.  
 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the truncated pyramid has four side 

surfaces (8, 9, 10, 11). 
Pump station according to claim 6, characterised in that a 
locking disc (23) is arranged on the rotatable central 

axle (16) in the region of the frame (17) and which cooperates 
with a spring loaded locking pin (24) secured to the 

frame (17). 
Pump station according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the locking pin (24) extends horizontally and can be actuated 

mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically. 
Pump station according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the locking pin (24) is connected to a swivellable foot 

operated rail (25) rotatably secured to the frame (17). 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the connections (4, 5) from the inflating 

station (3) extend downwards through the shaft (15) and emerge 
from the frame (17). 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the rotation of the polygonal housing (7) 

about the vertical centre line (6) can be controlled 
mechanically, pneumatically, hydraulically or electrically. 
Pump station according to claim 12, characterised in that 
chain wheels, toothed belts, piston and cylinder units with 

lever assemblies or motors, are arranged in the region of the 
frame (17) for rotation of the polygonal housing (7). 
Pump station according to claim 2, characterised in that 
two support elements (13, 14), spaced apart from each other, 

are arranged on each side surface (8, 9, 10, 11) of the 
polygonal housing (7). 
Pump station according to claim 14, characterised in that 
the support elements (13, 14) are respectively constructed as 

angle sections with an upper surface (26) and two side 
surfaces (27, 28) arranged at an angle thereto.  

 
Pump station according to claim 14, characterised in that 
the support elements (13, 14) are constructed as 

boxes (13' 14') or as rollers (13'', 14''). 
Pump station according to one of the preceding claims,
