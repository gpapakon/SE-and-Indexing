<ABSTRACT>
A bandgap voltage reference circuit employs a Vbe 
voltage multiplier network in a feedback line of an 

output amplifier of the bandgap reference circuit, thus 
permitting to independently fix the output voltage that 

is produced and the temperature coefficient thereof. A 
voltage reference having a linear negative temperature 

coefficient in an extended temperature variation range 
may be obtained, starting from a bandgap reference 

voltage with a positive temperature coefficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit capable
of generating a reference voltage having a negative
temperature coefficient, starting from a bandgap
reference with a positive temperature coefficient.In a large variety of electronic circuits, it is
often required that certain control parameters maintain
always the same preset values, independently of the
variation of temperature to which the circuit may be
subject. For example a parameter to be so controlled may
be the maximum limiting current that can circulate
through a load, that is, for example, through a power
transistor driving an external load. Commonly, such a
temperature stabilization is implemented by comparing
the voltage drop on a sensing resistance through which
the current to be controlled flows (which voltage drop
signal is normally used for driving a control and
regulation feedback loop) with a reference voltage.For example, if the control and regulation loop must
intervene always upon the reaching of the same output
current value, it is necessary that the reference
voltage vary with the temperature with the same law of
the sensing resistance, in view of the fact that a
resistor (in an integrated or discrete form) notably
has a nonnegligeable temperature coefficient.A circuit that is widely used for generating a
voltage that varies according to a precise law with the
temperature, is the so-called bandgap reference
circuit, a functional diagram of which is depicted in
Fig. 1.A bandgap reference circuit as the one shown in
Fig. 1, is based on the principle of exploiting 
variations of opposite sign with the temperature of
two parameters, namely the base-emitter voltage Vbe
(≈-2mV/°C) and the so-called thermal voltage: Vt
(≈+0.085mV/°C).By referring to the diagram of Fig. 1, the bandgap
voltage (Vbg) provided by the circuit is given by:
Vbg = Vbe1 + K*Vt
wherein:
Vt = k T q
and K is a constant that depends from the values of
the resistances RA and RB and by the ratio n2/n1 between
the emitter areas of the respective transistors
Q1 and Q2.By expanding the formula (1):
From the above formula (2) it may be observed that
by varying the ratio RB/RA and/or n2/n1, a temperature
coefficient of the Vbg that extends from -2mV/°C to
positive values may be obtained.The documents EP-A-0 216 265 discloses a band-gap
circuit for generating reference voltage of a
predeterminate temperature coefficient, which may also
be negative, starting from a band-gap voltage generated
by a band-gap reference circuit and an amplifier. The
circuit includes a network
