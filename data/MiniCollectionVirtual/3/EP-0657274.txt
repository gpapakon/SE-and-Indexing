<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for making envelopes including, amongst a succession of stations, stations (2, 3, 4) constituting an apparatus for producing windows in which a predetermined path is defined for a web (B) or sheets over which this web or these sheets are in contact with tools for producing windows, from a station (2) for cutting out windows to a station (4) for cutting out a shape. According to the invention, a second path is defined, inside the said apparatus, for the web (B) or the sheets along which the web or the sheets are not in contact with the said tools, the said predetermined path and second path including a common start (15) and end, the start being embodied by a mechanical switching device directing the web or the sheets selectively onto the said predetermined path or onto the said second path.

Machine for making envelopes including a sequence 
of stations comprising stations (2, 3, 4) for producing 

windows in a web (B) or in individual sheets, these 
window-producing stations constituting window-producing 

apparatus inside which there is defined a predetermined 
path for the web or the sheets, along which path this web 

or these sheets are placed in contact with window-producing 
tools, from a window-cutting station (2) as far as a 

shape-cutting station (4), the machine being characterized 
in that defined along the window-producing 

apparatus (2, 3, 4) is a second path for the web (B) or 
the sheets, along which path the web or the sheets are 

kept out of contact with the window-producing tools, the 
said predetermined path and the said second path having 

a common beginning (15) and a common end, and the beginning 
of the paths is physically embodied by a mechanical 

switching device selectively directing the web (B) or the 
sheets onto the said predetermined path or onto the said 

second path. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the window-producing apparatus includes, after the 

station (2) for cutting windows in the web (B) or the 
sheets, a station (3) for glueing and applying window 

material, comprising a drum carrying a reel (31) for 
feeding the apparatus with this material. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the window-producing apparatus includes, after the 

shape-cutting station (5), a station (5) for folding 
lateral tabs.  

 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the shape-cutting station (4) is 

equipped with at least one rotary cutting tool. 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the shape-cutting station (4) is 

equipped with bladed cutters. 
Machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the shape-cutting station (4) is 

equipped with flexible rotary cutters. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that arranged along the path along which the web (B) or 

the sheets are kept out of contact with the window-producing 
tools are rolls (16) for transporting the web 

or the sheets, with which rolls this web or these sheets 
are placed in contact. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the mechanical switching device is a coupling and 

uncoupling device, inserted in a path beginning at the 
exit (15) of a station (1) preceding the window-cutting 

station (2), for transmitting a movement to this window-cutting 
station (2) and interrupting the transmission of 

this movement, selectively. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the mechanical switching device is a dog-clutch 

device. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the window-producing apparatus includes a station 

(3) for glueing and applying window material, which 
station is associated with a mechanical switching device 

in the form of a dog-clutch coupling and uncoupling 
device for transmitting a movement to this station and 

interrupting the transmission of this movement, 
selectively. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the window-producing apparatus includes a shape-cutting 

station (4) associated with a mechanical switching 
device in the form of a dog-clutch coupling and 

uncoupling device for transmitting a movement to this 
station and interrupting the transmission of this movement,  

 
selectively. 
Machine according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the window-cutting station (2) is equipped with at 

least one roll (16) for transporting the web or the 
sheets. 
Machine according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the station (3) for glueing and applying window 

material is equipped with at least one roll (16) for 
transporting either the web or the sheets. 
Machine according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the shape-cutting station (4) is equipped with at 

least one roll (16) for transporting the web or the 
sheets.
