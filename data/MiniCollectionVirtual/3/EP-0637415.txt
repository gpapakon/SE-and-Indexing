<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to a
system and method for resolving the location of a station
on a network, and more specifically to a system and method
for resolving the location of a station on a segment of a
network which is transparently bridged to another segment
in that network.There are various computer network topologies and
protocols available today. Of particular interest for the
present invention and probably the most widely used scheme
for controlling a local area network on a bus structure is
the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
(CSMA/CD), or the IEEE 802.3 standard. The most widely
used implementation of CSMA/CD is found in the Ethernet
specification.Most local area networks may be interconnected via
gateways, routers or bridges. A bridge provides the
interconnection between two local area networks of the same
type and makes decisions about switching frames between
local area networks based on the address of a station.
Bridges may use different algorithms in making its routing
decision, some of which operate transparently to end
stations on the network.The efficient operation of a computer network is
critical both in terms of mainframe computer efficiency and 
individual workstation productivity. The ability to
measure network response times associated with the
workstations and the ability to determine bottlenecks or
other network inefficiencies which may detract from network
response time is important for network designers,
administrators and end users. Copending United States
Patent Application Serial No. 992,439, which is assigned to
the assignee of the present invention and which is hereby
incorporated by reference, describes a novel system and
method for deriving operating statistics for a local area
network based on the role of a station on the network and
the network traffic being monitored. Such operating
statistics are useful in maintaining the efficient
operation of the network.In the token ring environment, the network monitor as
described in the aforementioned copending application is
capable of correctly identifying the addresses of the
stations residing on its ring by using the active and
standby monitor frames of the token ring protocol. Knowing
which stations are on the local ring is fundamental in
determining the operating statistics as described in that
application. In the Ethernet environment, however, it is
not always possible for the network monitor to correctly
identify the addresses of the stations residing on its
local segment
