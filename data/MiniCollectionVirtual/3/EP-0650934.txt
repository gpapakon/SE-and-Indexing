<ABSTRACT>
Furnace for melting vitrifiable substances, comprising a compartment (1) for melting/refining the glass provided, in an upstream part, with at least one opening (12) intended to be fed with vitrifiable substances (10) with the aid of a furnace-loading device placed facing, and in the downstream part of, an exit opening (17) for the molten glass emerging into one or more successive downstream compartments (18, 19) intended to conduct the molten glass towards the forming zone, characterised in that the melting of the vitrifiable substances is ensured in the melting/refining compartment (1), for the most part, by a plurality of burners (16) with oxidising agent composed of oxygen and in that it is designed without any delivery of air into the melting/refining compartment (1) originating from the downstream compartment(s).

Application of a furnace to the supply of molten glass to
installations for forming flat glass of the float-glass

installation type, the said furnace comprising a compartment
(1) for melting/refining the glass, the said compartment being

provided, at the upstream part, with at least one opening (12)
being fed with vitrifiable materials (10) by means of a

charging device placed opposite, and close to which there is at
least one opening (14) for discharging the combustion gases

and, in the downstream part, an opening (14) for discharging
the molten glass, opening out into one or more successive

downstream compartments (18, 19) intended to take the molten
glass to the forming area, the melting of the vitrifiable

materials being ensured, in the melting/refining compartment
(1) essentially by a plurality of oxygen burners (16),


characterised in that
 the said melting/refining compartment (1)
is designed without any inlet of air notably from the

downstream compartment or compartments, and 
in that
 the
upstream part (8) of the said melting/refining compartment (1)

where the vitrifiable materials (10) are charged is protected
from the radiation of the flames from the burners (16) by a

heat screen means (11) of the shadow wall or surbased arch
type, and notably with no burners, all the vitrifiable

materials being fed into the furnace in the upstream part.
Application according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
furnace is equipped with at least one means for sealing, vis-à-vis

gases, the melting and refining compartment (1) notably
between the latter and the downstream compartment or one of the

downstream compartments (18, 19). 
Application according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the burners (16) are arranged opposite each other in two
rows, the burners opening out into the melting/refining

compartment (1) through side walls (4, 5) thereof.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the burners (16) are arranged in a

plurality of groups whose heating power is regulated
autonomously from one group to another.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 auxiliary heating means are provided in
the melting/refining compartment (1), notably in the form of

electrodes immersed in the depth of the molten glass.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the walls of the melting/refining
compartment (1), notably the side walls (4, 5) and the crown

(7), are equipped with reinforced insulation means in the form
of panels made of fibrous insulating material and/or sprayed

insulating concrete.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the ratio between the depth of the molten
glass and the total height of the melting and production

compartment (1) measured between the bottom (6) and the
keystone (7) is, upstream of the heat screen means (11), less

than that measured downstream of the said screen.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the opening or openings (12) for feeding
vitrifiable materials (10) are formed in the upstream part (8)

of the melting/refining compartment (1) in its front wall (2) 
or in at least one of its two side walls (4, 5).
Application according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 it
has two openings (12, 13) for feeding vitrifiable materials

(10) in the upstream part (8) of the melting and production
compartment (1), openings formed symmetrically with respect to

each other in the two side walls (4, 5) of the said compartment
(1).
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the melting/refining compartment (1) is
provided with openings (14) for discharging the combustion

fumes situated in its upstream part (8) where the vitrifiable
materials are charged, openings formed in its front wall (2) or

in at least one of its two side walls (4, 5).
Application according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that

auxiliary openings (15) for discharging the combustion fumes
are provided in the melting and production compartment (1) in

its side walls (4, 5).
Application according to one of Claims 10 or 11,

characterised in that
 the combustion fumes discharged from the
melting and production compartment (1) are transferred to heat

recovery devices of the boiler type or devices for heating the
vitrifiable materials before charging.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the means (22, 23, 24) for sealing, vis-à-vis
gases, between the melting and production compartment (1)

and the downstream compartment or compartments (18, 19) has or
have at least one suspended screen and/or a dam partially

immersed in the molten glass. 
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the means (22, 23, 24) for sealing, vis-à-vis
gases, between the melting and production compartment (1)

are provided at the junction between the melting and production
compartment (1) and the adjacent downstream compartment (19)

and/or at the junction between two successive downstream
compartments (18, 19) and/or in one of the downstream

compartments close to one of these junctions.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the melting and production compartment
(1) opens out into a first downstream compartment (18) with a

smaller cross-section, referred to as the fore-channel, itself
opening out into a second downstream compartment (19) with an

even smaller cross-section, referred to as the channel.
Application according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the dimensions of the downstream
compartment or compartments (18, 19) with respect to the

melting and production compartment (1) are chosen so that they
determine a depth of molten glass circulating in the said

downstream compartment or compartments without recirculation of
the molten glass to the melting and production compartment (1).
