<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a calender in 
calendering of a paper web, wherein the paper web 

(W) is passed through a calendering nip (N), which 
calendering nip (N) is formed between a roll (22) 

which has been provided with a soft face by means 
of a coating or in an equivalent way and a heatable 

hard roll (21). The heatable roll (21) is heated so as 
to plasticize the surface layer of the paper web (W) 

that is placed at the side of the heatable roll (21), 
preferably so that the temperature of the surface 

layer in the calendering nip (N) exceeds the glass- 
transition temperatures of the polymers contained in 

the paper. In the method, before entering into the 
calendering hip (N), the paper web (W) is 

moistened, so as to lower the glass-transition temperatures 
of the polymers contained in the paper, 

and pre-heated. The pre-heating of the paper web 
(W) is carried out by bringing the paper web (W) 

into contact with the heatable roll (21) before the 
web enters into the calendering nip (N) and by, 

before the calendering nip (N), feeding steam or 
water onto the face of the paper web (W) that is 

placed at the side of the heatable roll (21) so as to 
improve the transfer of heat from the hot roll to the 

paper web (W).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of calendering a paper web, wherein the paper 
web is passed through a calendering nip, which calendering nip is formed between 
a roll which has been provided with a soft face by means of a coating or in an 
equivalent way and a heatable hard roll, into which nip the paper web is passed over a paper alignment roll, and, in which method the heatable roll is heated 
so as to plasticize the surface layer of the paper web that is placed at the side of the 
heatable roll, preferably so that the temperature of the surface layer in the calendering 
nip exceeds the glass-transition temperatures of the polymers contained in the 
paper, and in which method, before entering into the calendering nip, the paper web 
is moistened, so as to lower the glass-transition temperatures of the polymers 
contained in the paper, and pre-heated by bringing the paper web into contact with the heatable roll before the web enters into the calendering nip. The invention also concerns a calender that makes use of the method, which calender 
comprises a calendering nip, which is formed between a roll that has been provided 
with a soft face by means of a coating or in an equivalent way and a heatable hard 
roll and through which calendering nip the paper web is arranged to run, said calender being provided with a paper alignment roll by means of which the paper web is passed into the nip, and, the 
heatable roll being arranged to be heated so as to plasticize the surface layer of the 
paper web that is placed at the side of the heatable roll, preferably so that the 
temperature in the surface layer in the calendering nip exceeds the glass-transition 
temperatures of the polymers contained in the paper, and the calender comprising 
means for moistening and pre-heating of the paper web before the 
calendering nip. By means of calendering of paper, attempts are made to improve the quality values 
of paper that have already been achieved or, with a standard quality level, to achieve 
a higher running speed or a better bulk of the paper. The plasticity (readiness of 
moulding) of paper can be increased by raising the temperature or increasing the 
moisture content in the paper. A considerable change takes place in the plasticity of  
 
paper when the temperature of the polymers contained in the paper rises up to or 
beyond the so-called glass-transition temperature. Then, the paper can be moulded 
more readily than below the glass-transition temperature. An increased moisture 
content in paper lowers the
