<ABSTRACT>
A catheterization system for embedment in a patient includes a 
sharp edge needle (18) at the proximal end portion of the catheter (12). 

A protective sheath (20) is received about the needle (18) for relative 
slidable movement thereon between a first position wherein the sharp edge 

of the needle extends beyond the protective sheath and a second position 
wherein the blunt leading proximal edge of the protective sheath extends 

beyond and covers the sharp edge of the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to catheters and, more specifically, 
to a catheter having a protective cover that protects 
the sharp edge after insertion of the catheter into the body of a 
patient. Many current medical practices involve gaining access to a 
body cavity or blood vessel by the penetration of tissues with a 
sharp edged instrument, most typically a needle. The sharp edged 
instrument may be used to obtain a tissue sample. In other situations, 
the sharp edged instrument is replaced by a blunt edged 
catheter which may remain in the body for an extended period of 
time. The procedure for inserting a catheter into a blood vessel 
is usually performed using the Seldinger technique wherein a 
sharp edged needle is used to penetrate the tissues and into the 
blood vessel, a guide wire is inserted through the needle into 
the vessel, the needle is removed, and a catheter having a blunt 
edge is advanced along the guide wire and into the vessel. The sharp edged instrument cannot be left in the body for 
any extended period of time due to the potential for trauma from 
the sharp edge. A catheter may be used, for example, to drain 
fluid from the chest cavity. Embedding a sharp edged needle 
would pose a risk of penetrating and collapsing a lung.  While the Seldinger technique does provide a method for 
insertion of a blunt edged catheter that remains in the body, it 
is complex, cumbersome, and time consuming to perform. In addition, 
the multiple parts involved in the Seldinger technique 
result in increased waste of sterile supplies and is expensive. 
There is, accordingly, a need for a catheterization system which 
is simpler and faster to use, less expensive, and results in less 
waste than known systems. The present invention consists of a catheter that includes a 
sharp edge for penetrating bodily tissues and means for covering 
the sharp edge after the catheter has reached its intended position. 
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a tubular 
sheath is received about the proximal, sharp edged end of a catheter. 
The sheath is initially held in a retracted position 
wherein the sharp edge of the catheter is exposed. Upon insertion 
of the catheter to the intended position in a patient, the 
sheath is slidably advanced proximally on the catheter to a position 
overlying and covering the sharp edged end portion of the 
catheter. The present invention offers improved and safer 
catheterization methods. For example, in the catheterization of 
a body cavity, once the exposed sharp edge

A catheter system for embedment in a patient, comprising: 

a) a first tubular member having a proximal end portion with 
a sharp edge for insertion into the patient; 
b) a second coaxial tubular member received about said first 
tubular member for relative slidable movement thereon 

between a first position wherein said sharp edge extends 
beyond said second tubular member and a second position 

wherein said second tubular member covers said sharp edge; 
and 
c) a proximal end portion of said second tubular member and 
having a blunt leading proximal edge. 
A catheter system as defined in claim 1, further comprising biasing 
means for moving said second tubular member from said first position to 

said second position. 
A catheter system as defined in claim 2, further comprising 
releasable retaining means for holding said second tubular member in said 

first position against said biasing means and, upon release thereof, for 
permitting said biasing means to move said second tubular member to said 

second position. 
A catheter system as defined in any of claims 1-3, wherein said 
first tubular member includes a balloon which is inflatable from the distal 

end of said first tubular member. 
A catheter system as defined in any of claims 1-4, wherein said 
first tubular member includes means for injecting dye from the proximal 

end portion thereof. 
A method of catheterization of a patient, comprising the steps of: 

a) inserting into the patient a first tubular member having a 
proximal end portion with a sharp edge; 
b) providing a second, coaxial tubular member which is 
received about said first tubular member and which includes 

a proximal end portion having a blunt edge; and 
c) advancing said second tubular member from a first position 
wherein said sharp edge extends beyond said second tubular 

member and a second position wherein said second tubular 
member covers said sharp edge. 
A method as defined in claim 6, further comprising the step of 
biasing said second tubular member from said first position toward said 

second position. 
A method as defined in claim 7, further comprising the step of 
releasably returning said second member in said first position thereby 

preventing movement by said biasing step until released. 
A method as defined in any of claims 6-8, further comprising the 
step of maneuvering the position of said first tubular member inside the 

patient following advancement of said second tubular member. 
A method as defined in any of claims 6-9, wherein said first tubular 
member includes a balloon and further comprising the step of inflating 

said balloon. 
A method as defined in any of claims 6-10, wherein said first 
tubular member includes means for injecting dye from said proximal end 

portion and further comprising the step of injecting dye into the patient. 
A method of catheterization of a patient, comprising the steps of: 

a) inserting into the patient a first tubular member having a 
proximal end portion with a sharp edge; 
b) providing a second, coaxial tubular member which is 
received about said first tubular member and which includes 

a proximal end portion having a blunt edge; 
c) advancing said second tubular member from a first position 
wherein said sharp edge extends beyond said second tubular 

member and a second position wherein said second tubular 
member covers said sharp edge; 
d) maneuvering said first tubular member inside the patient; 
e) retracting said second tubular member to expose said sharp 
edge; 
f) maneuvering said first tubular member inside the patient; 
and 
g) advancing said second tubular member to cover said sharp 
edge.
