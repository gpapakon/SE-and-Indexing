<ABSTRACT>
Packaging elements for supporting packaged articles (3) with non-planar surfaces in an outer package (4) are made from a starting material with a number of raised portions or projections (2) by post-shaping some (2a, 2b) of the said raised portions or projections by pressing in such a manner that they will cooperate to support the article (3). In this manner it is achieved that the same starting material (1,2) may be used for making packaging elements for articles of various shapes. The equipment in the form of press tools (not shown) may comprise upper and lower pressing blocks detachably secured to an upper platen and a lower press platen respectively, so that it is possible to move and/or exchange the pressing blocks for adaptation to packaged articles of various shapes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING PACKAGING ELEMENTS FROM FIBRE-PULP MATERIALTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of making packaging elements of the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 1.BACKGROUND ART When carrying out methods of this kind, it has up to now been necessary to alter the moulds, with which the packaging elements are made, each time a change occurs in the shape of the articles to be packaged by using the packaging elements, e.g. by these elements being used as an intermediate layer or protecting element between the article concerned and a outer packaging means, frequently in the form of a corrugated-paper box.To change the mould is, however, a very costly ope¬ ration, and can only be defended from an economic point of view, if very large series are to be produced. For this reason, it has up to now been difficult to find a method for appropriate packaging of articles with non-planar sides, e.g. bottles, video cameras, cameras etc., and in many cases it has been necessary to use rather primitive solutions, such as the use of a loose filling in the form of foam-plastic elements or crumpled paper.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONOn this background, it is the object of the present invention to provide a method of the kind referred to ini¬ tially, with which it is possible in a reasonably eco¬ nomical manner to produce packaging elements for use in packaging articles with non-planar surfaces, even when relatively small series are to be produced, and this object is achieved with a method, which according to the present invention is characterized by the steps set forth 

in the characterizing clause of claim 1.By proceeding in this manner, it is possible for the initial part of the production of the elements to use the same mould all the time, viz. corresponding to the shape of the starting material, this material not until after the drying to the rigid state being adapted to the shape of the various articles to be packaged, such adaptation being possible to carry out at a substan¬ tially lower cost than what is required to modify the moulds.Advantageous embodiments for the method, the effect of which will be evident from the following detailed portion of the present specification, are set forth in claims 2-9. The present invention also relates to an equipment comprising press tools and/or counter-press tools for car¬ rying out the method according to the present invention, and according to this invention this equipment is charac¬ terized by the features set forth in the

 C L A I M S :
1. Method of making packaging elements to be used as packaging means for one or a number of articles or as intermediate material between an outer packaging means and one or a number of articles, said elements consisting of fiber-pulp material in a roughly uniformly thick layer shaped with raised portions or projections intended to abut against the article or articles, characterized in a) that as starting material are used preforms of fiber-pulp material shaped as a base material with a number of raised portions or projections and subsequently dried to a rigid state, and b) that said preforms are subjected to pressing in such a manner that a number of said raised portions or projections are depressed fully or partly in such a manner that when one or a number of the articles, the packaging of which said packaging elements are to be used for, are placed in contact with the elements in the regions of fully or partly 
'
 depressed projections, the article or articles will at the same time abut against and be supported by at least some of the fully or partly depressed projections.
2. Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the pressing operation is carried out using a) press tools, the pressing surfaces of which at least on those parts working on the projections during the pressing operation correspond to that surface or those surfaces on the article or ar¬ ticles, against which the projections are to abut, said press tools being made to perform relative movement against the starting material on the side, from which the projections protrude, and b) counter-press tools with counter-projections cor¬ responding to the projections in the starting 


 material, the surfaces of said counter-press tools facing said press tools being shaped corresponding to the shape of said parts of the press tools working on the projections during the pressing operation, said counter-press tools being made to perform relative movement against the press tools and the starting material on the opposite side of the latter (Figure 7) .
3. Method according to claim 2, characterized by the use of press tools and/or counter-press tools, in which at least the active surface on one of the two pres¬ sing members working on opposite sides of a projection in the starting material is shaped on a part of the member concerned consisting of rubber-elastic material.
4. Method according to any one or any of the claims 1—3, characterized in that the pressing operation is carried out in such a manner a) that at least one projection is completely depres¬ sed so that its material after the pressing ope¬ ration is in general alignment with the base mate¬ rial of the starting material, and/or b) that at least one projection is depressed in such .a manner that its height is reduced over at least part of its dimension extending parallel to the base material.
5. Method according to any one or any of the claims .-4: , characterized in that the pressing operation is carried out in such a manner that at least one projection is depressed so as to make its external shape and dimen¬ sions correspond at least approximately to the internal shape and dimensions of at least one other projection.
6. Method according to any one or any of the claims 


1-5, characterized in that the pressing operation is carried out while supplying heat.
7. Method according to any one or any of the claims 1-6, characterized by the use of starting material in the form of sheets or web material with uniform raised portions or projections placed in a regular pattern, e.g. in rows crossing each other at right angles or in a honeycomb pattern.
8. Method according to any one or any of the claims 1-7, characterized in that one or a number of articles having the same shape as the article or articles to be packaged are used as a component of the press tool or tools.
9. Method according to any one or any of. the claims 1-8, characterized in the use of starting material in the form of sheets or web material consisting of a base material with raised portions or projections each con¬ sisting of at least one obliquely extending side wall and a top wall extending substantially parallel to the base material, and in which the angle between two mutually opposing side walls or mutually opposed parts of a side wall is between 20° and 40°, preferably approximately 30°.
10. Equipment comprising press tools and/or counter-press tools for carrying out the method according to any one or any of the claims 1-9, characterized by comprising at least a) a base plate (6,5) with securing means (8,7) placed in a pattern corresponding to the pattern, in which the raised portions or projections on
.
 said sheets or web material are placed, and b) at least one pressing member (10) or counter-pres- 


sing member (9a-9d) adapted to be secured to said base plate (6,5) by means of the securing means (8,7) and to work on the projection or projections (2a-2d) situated in a corresponding position on the starting material.
