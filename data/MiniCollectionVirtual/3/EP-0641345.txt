<ABSTRACT>
Starting from cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, via the 4,7-dihydro-1,3-dioxepin and trans-6-acylamino-5-chloro-1,3-dioxepans the novel tetrahydro-[1,3]-dioxepino[5,6-b]
azirines of formula (VI) were synthesized, and therefrom the novel hypoglycaemically active N-sulfonyl-tetrahydro-[1,3]-dioxepino[5,6-b]
azirines of formula (I). The inventive compounds are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of other biologically active substances.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HYPOGLYCEHIC N-SULFOHYL-TETRAHYDR0-(1.3)-DI0XEPIMO(5,6-B)AZIRIHES,The present invention relates to new N-suIfonyl-tetrahydro-[l,3]-dioxepino[5,6-b]- azirines, to methods and intermediates for their preparation, and to their use in the preparation of hypoglycaemic agents.It has been known, that the clinical therapy of noninsulin-dependent diabetes Type II (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM), relies nowadays on only two classes of hypoglycaemic compounds: sulfonylureas and biguanides. [R. SARGES, Progr. Med. Chem. 18, 191 (1981); A.C ASMAL and A. MARBLE, Drugs, 28, 62 (1984); L.P. KRALL in: Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus, 12th Ed., Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia, 1985, p. 412].It has been known as well, that representatives of numerous compound classes, . such as e.g. thiazolinedione (ciglitazon, pioglitazon, CP-72467), sulfonyl- imidazoline (CGP 11112), carboxamidine (linoglirid), oxiranecarboxylic acids (etomoxir), piridyl ethyl imidazoline (DG 5125), polysaccharides (acarbose), and several others, were introduced into clinical testings of hypoglycaemic activity, yet none came on the market, owing to the insufficient efficacy or other reasons [ R.J. MOHRBACHER el al, Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 22, 213 (1987); E.R. LARSON et al, Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 25, 205 (1989); K.E. STEINER and E.L. LIEN, Prog. Med. Chem. 24, 209 (1987); S.C. STINSON, Chem. Eng. News, Sept. 30, 1991].According to the Applicant's own searches on Prior Art the N-sulfonyl- tetrahydro-[l,3]-dioxepino[5,6-b]azirines of the following formula I represent a novel class of heterocyclic compounds and a new class of potent hypoglycaemics.The first object of the present invention are new N-sulfoπyl-tetrahydro-[l,3]- dioxepino[5,6-b]azirines of the general formula ISUBSTITUTE SHEET 
wherein R^ and R^ may stand for a hydrogen atom, a straight or a branched C1.4 alkyl, or a phenyl, and R1 + R^ may stand for an alkylidene group, such as e.g. a tetramethylene, a pentamethylene or a hexamethylene group, and R^ may stand for an alkyl group, such as e.g. a methyl or a trifluoromethyl group, or a p- substituted phenyl groupwherein X may stand for a hydrogen atom, a straight or a branched 

 alkyl, or a halogen atom, such as e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or a nitro, an amino, or an acylamiπo group, such as e.g. acetylamino, or an alkoxy group, such as e.g. a methoxy group, according to one of the following reactions (Schemes 1-4)SUBSTITUTE SHEET
