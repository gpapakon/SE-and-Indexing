<ABSTRACT>
An optical collimator array having an optical fiber 
array (5) for aligning and fixing optical fibers, and 

a microlens array (11) formed by arranging lenses integrally 
and connected to the optical fiber array with a 

predetermined distance, has a spacer (21) for fixing said 
microlens array connected to said optical fiber array in 

such a manner that light axes at an end of said optical 
fibers in said optical fiber array are made coincident 

with those of said lenses in said microlens array. 
The light axes alignment mentioned above is performed by 

arranging reference optical fibers (5a) at both sides 
of and on the same plane of the optical fibers of th
e 
optical fiber array; emanating a light beam upon the 

optical fibers and the reference optical fibers; picking 
up light beams emitted from the microlens through the 

optical fibers of the optical fiber array, and light 
beams emitted directly from the reference optical fibers; 

displaying the picked up light beams as light spots on a 
monitor; and adjusting a positional relation between the 

optical fiber array and the microlens array in such a 
manner that light spots of the microlens array are  

 
existent on a reference line generated between light 

spots of the reference optical fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
collimator assembly comprising an optical fiber array,
and a microlens
array arranged at a
predetermined distance from the optical fiber array, and a method of aligning optical
axes of the optical collimator assembly.Recently, an Exiton Absorption
Reflection Switch (EARS) having a signal regeneration
function has been described in, for example, TECHNICAL
REPORT OF IEICE A-P92-78, SSE92-70 (1992-10) "Experiment
digital free-space photonic switch". In this EARS, an
optical collimator is used at a light incident
portion and a light exit portion thereof. This optical
collimator functions to supply light signals
emitted through an array of optical fibers into a two-dimensional
photonic device as parallel light beams.The optical collimator assembly comprises an optical
fiber array of aligned and fixed optical fibers, and a 
microlens array arranged near the optical fiber array at
a predetermined distance therefrom. In the optical collimator
mentioned above, one end portion of the optical fiber
array faces one end of the microlens array at a
distance substantially equal to a focal length of the
microlens array. Therefore, diverging light beams emitted
from the optical fiber array are converted into parallel
light beams.As to a manufacturing method of the optical
collimator mentioned above, it is assumed that the
optical fiber array and the microlens array are arranged
on the same substrate and are spaced at a distance
substantially equal to a focal length. However, in the
manufacturing method mentioned above, it is very
difficult to arrange the optical fiber array and the
microlens array with a distance substantially equal to a
focal length and to make axes of the optical
fibers of the optical fiber array coincident with axes of the
microlens array. Moreover, in the construction
mentioned above, the strength of the optical collimator
is lowered and handling of the optical
collimator array becomes difficult.That is to say, in order to align the optical axes
in the optical collimator having the construction
mentioned above, a light beam is made incident upon one end
of the optical fiber array being opposite to an end 
facing the microlens array, and then a light emitted
from the microlens array is picked up by for example CCD
camera and is displayed on a monitor. Then, spots of
the lights displayed on the monitor are aligned in one
direction by moving the optical fiber array and the
microlens array relatively. After the spots are aligned
in the manner mentioned above,
