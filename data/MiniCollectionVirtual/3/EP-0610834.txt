<ABSTRACT>
On a mounting tool (10) designed as a ratchet socket spanner with socket tube (14) which can be used either way, reinforcing bosses (22) with striking surfaces (24) are formed on the freewheel cover part (12), so that the tool can be used for screwing tight or unscrewing hexagon head screws or hexagon nuts, or, alternatively, as a striking tool for driving in and loosening wedges or positioning components. To save weight, the handle part (11) is made of light metal and the freewheel cover part (12) bearing the reinforcing bosses (22) with the striking surfaces (24) is a steel forging.

<CLAIMS>
An assembling tool having a nut-rotating tool, (nut insertion tube 14) which is 
attached via a free-wheel coupling to a handle part (11) in the form of a hand lever, 

and wherein hammer-like impact faces (22, 24) are formed on it in the outer region 
of the mounting of the nut-rotating tool (14),
 
characterised in that
 
the elongated handle part (11) is formed from light metal, with a long manipulating 

part (18) and an upper ring- and guidance part (19), and that a free-wheel cover part 
(12), which is fashioned as a component to be manufactured separately, is provided 

with two strengthening formations (22) disposed externally and opposite each other, 
which comprise the hammer-like impact faces (24), which strengthening formations 

also comprise partially projection-like edge formations which fit over the ring- and 
guidance part (19) of the handle part (11), and wherein the free-wheel cover part (12) 

is constructed as a steel forging. 
An assembling tool according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
it is equipped, as a ratchet spanner which can be used in both directions of rotation, 

with a hexagon socket tube which passes through as the nut insertion tube (14). 
An assembling tool according to at least one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the strengthening formations (22) have a width (26) which is approximately equal to 

the bearing diameter of the nut insertion tube (14). 
An assembling tool according to at least one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the ratio of the length (25) of the strengthening formations (22) to the width (26) of 

the same is about 5:7.  
 
An assembling tool according to at least one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the internal contour of the strengthening formations (22) extends partially cylindrically 

in the vicinity of the cylindrical outer wall of the ring- and guidance part (19).
