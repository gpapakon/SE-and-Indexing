<ABSTRACT>
In a process for determining immanent (intrinsic) forces of a supply reel mounted on an axle in carrying arms of a reelstand, the carrying arms are provided with a number of measured value pickups. The results determined are fed to a computer which subsequently, after the entry of the width and the specific gravity of the material web, determines the length of the material web. A device is provided for carrying out the method.

Method of determining a length of a web of a
supply reel (19) axially mounted in supporting arms (7,

9; 8, 10) of a reel carrier (46 [sic]), the deflection

of the supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10) as a result of the
supply reel (19) axially mounted on the supporting arms

(7, 9; 8, 10) being determined by virtue of the fact
that the associated electrical signals (40, 58)

determined by measuring sensors (24, 25, 26, 27; 61, 62,
63, 64; 66, 67, 68, 69; 76, 77, 78, 79) arranged on the

supporting arms (7, 9, 8, 10) are fed to a computer
(39), and the computer (39), after the width (43) and

the specific weight (42) of the web as well as the
angular position of the supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10)

have been fed, determines the length of the web.
Method of measuring inherent forces of a supply
reel axially mounted in supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10) of

a reel carrier (46 [sic]), the deflection of the

supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10) as a result of the supply
reel axially mounted on the supporting arms (7, 9; 8,

10) being determined in the dynamic state by virtue of
the fact that the associated electrical signals (40, 58)

determined by measuring sensors (24, 25, 26, 27; 61, 62,
63, 64; 66, 67, 68, 69; 76, 77, 78, 79) arranged on the

supporting arms (7, 9, 8, 10) are fed to a computer
(39), and a signal (54) is transmitted if a preset value

of a centrifugal force is exceeded.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the measuring sensors (24, 25, 26, 27; 61, 62,

63, 64; 66, 67, 68, 69; 76, 77, 78, 79) are designed as
strain gauges (24, 25, 26, 27; 61, 62, 63, 64; 66, 67,

68, 69; 76, 77, 78, 79).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the strain gauges (24, 25, 26, 27; 61, 62, 63, 64;)

are arranged on right-hand and left-hand side surfaces
(56, 57) of the supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10). 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the strain gauges (66, 67, 68, 69; 76, 77, 78, 79)

are arranged on those side surfaces (71, 72; 73, 74) of
the supporting arms (7, 9; 8, 10) which face the supply

reel (19) and are remote from the supply reel (19).
