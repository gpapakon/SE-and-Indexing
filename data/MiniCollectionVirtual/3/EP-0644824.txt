<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing segmented hollow body devices (36) and the resulting products (36). The segmentation is accomplished by providing areas (26) of increased cross section around the circumference of the preform (20) followed by axial compression thereof. These steps are followed by removal of the axial force resulting in a product (36) which is segmented in accordance with the areas (26) of increased cross section and has a reduced free height.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEGMENTED POLYMER ENERGY ABSORPTION DEVICE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAMEThis invention relates generally to a new hollow body device and to an improved method of making, more particularly it relates to a segmented hollow body device and to its manufacture from copolyester polymer elastomer material.BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAs discussed in U.S. Patent Numbers: 4,198,037 and 4,566,678 to David Anderson and assigned to the assignee of the present application, and Defensive Publication Number 190960 to Dominic Bianca and assigned to E. I. du Pont de Neumours & Co., thermoplastic elastomers have been widely used for the manufacture of compression springs. The thermoplastic elastomer discussed in these references is a copolyester polymer elastomer such as sold by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Del., under the Trademark "HYTREL".Generally, this type of polymer elastomer material has inherent physical properties that make it unsuitable for use as a compression spring. However, as noted in the above cited references, a method is set forth whereby copolyester polymer elastomer material can be treated for rendering the material usable for the manufacture of a compression spring.This invention continues with the experimentation and development of physical modification of the elastomer block before the application of a compressive force as set forth in the above noted references. An objective is to tailor the shape of the starting material in order to produce a spring having a given spring rate. For example, when designing an elastomer spring, it is often necessary to incorporate a number of serially arranged subsidiary spring elements to satisfy the desired spring characteristics, all within a predefined envelope or space. This serial arrangement requires some method of segmenting or separating the subsidiary spring elements within the envelope.Previous methods have generally relied on separate parts, such as steel plates, to either physically separate or segment the required subsidiary spring elements. These methods generally include a number of inherent disadvantages. First, theSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

necessity and expense of the segmentation or separation elements themselves. Second, the added complication and expense of assembling the various parts. The Bianca reference achieves spring rate modifications by securing steel disks around a "HYTREL" block followed by compression. The result is a segmented column spring wherein each segment is separated by a steel disk. The Anderson Patent,

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of producing a segmented energy absorption device from a copolyester polymer elastomer material comprising the steps of: providing a single block of said copolyester polymer elastomer having a preselected initial axial length, a transverse shape, an initial core opening extending axially through said block and bands of increased cross section area at predetermined locations, said material being such that upon being axially compressed at least 30 % of said initial axial length the material will permanently retain a substantial portion of the length reduction after being compressed; applying to said block having said bands of increased cross section area an axial force sufficient to compress said block at least 30 % of its initial axial length to change the transverse shape of said block such that it takes a set and the configuration of said core opening is changed to a series of hollow bodies of a preselected configuration; and removing said axial force from said block.
2. The method of producing a segmented energy absorption device employing the method of claim 1 wherein said block is a tube having a major axis extending the length thereof and said bands of increased cross section area have major axis which are perpendicular to the major axis of said tube.
3. A method of making a compressions spring member comprising the steps of: providing a tube of thermoplastic elastomer material having a selected initial axial length, a major axis, an initial core opening and bands of increased cross sectional area having an axis located generally perpendicular to said major axis, said bands of increased cross section are ribbed means which extend the circumference of said outer surface of said tube, said material being such that upon being axially compressed at least 30% of said initial axial length the material will permanently retain a substantial portion of the length reduction induced by compression; applying an axial force sufficient to compress said tube having said bands
SUBST 


of increased cross sectional area, at least 30% of its initial axial length to change the initial core opening into a series of permanently expended transversely outwardly core openings bounded by bands of increased cross sectional areas to thereby provide a segmented hollow body compression spring; and removing said axial force from said block which has taken a permanent set.
4. A method in accordance with Claim 3 wherein said ribbed means are spaced generally equally distance apart along said major axis.
