<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a room temperature 
curing composition for use in various coatings for 

interior and exterior sidings, automotive bodies, 
household electrical appliances and plastic substrates 

and particularly for coatings required to have weather 
resistance and durability. The room temperature curing 

composition of this invention comprises an emulsion 
obtained by a multi-stage polymerization of monomers, 

said emulsion comprising emulsion particles, the core 
of which is formed by polymerization of (A) a silyl 

group-containing vinyl monomer, (B) an alkyl or cycloalkyl 
methacrylate whose alkyl moiety contains not less 

than 4 carbon atoms, and (C) a non-hydrophilic vinyl 
monomer other than (B) and the outer shell of which is 

formed by polymerization of (A), (B), (C) and (D) a 
hydrophilic vinyl monomer. The room temperature curing 

composition of this invention features a high stability 
of silyl groups it contains and a remarkably improved 

film-forming property even after prolonged storage. 
Moreover, it is very satisfactory in mechanical stability, 

water resistance, durability and white enamel 
gloss.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a room temperature 
curing composition for various coating systems, particularly 
for weather-resistant, durable coatings, for 
application to interior and exterior sidings, automotive 
shell plates, home electrical appliance housings, and 
various plastic substrates. Recently, in the field of coatings and adhesives, 
organic solvent-based systems are being replaced with 
water-soluble or -dispersible systems to clear the 
regulations for pollution control and for resources 
conservation. However, because of the absence of crosslinking 
functional groups, the conventional water-based coating 
systems are susceptible to the influence of the surfactants 
used in the polymerization system so that the 
coating films that can be obtained are poor in weather 
resistance, water resistance and fouling resistance, 
thus being inferior to solvent-based coating systems in 
many film physical properties. Therefore, to provide a crosslinkable emulsion, 
the application of an alkoxysilyl group-containing  
 
emulsion in the field of coatings has been proposed. 
However, the alkoxysilyl group is easily hydrolyzed in 
the presence of water so that the film-forming performance 
of the emulsion suffers considerable aging 
and, moreover, the emulsion is poor in mechanical 
stability and white enamel gloss. EP-A-0 346 886 relates to a water-dispersible resin composition 
which is obtainable by reacting a silane monomer (A) 
having a hydrolytic functional group and/or a silanol group 
and a polymerisable unsaturated bond with a vinyl monomer (B) 
in an aqueous medium, thus obtaining a three-dimensionally 
crosslinked particulate polymer. Examples of hydrolytic functional 
groups in the silane monomer are alkoxy groups and 
alkoxy-alkoxy groups. The obtained particulate polymer is 
reacted with the silane monomer (A) and/or an allyl acrylate 
or allyl methacrylate (C) and copolymerising the resulting 
reaction product with a vinyl monomer component comprising a 
carboxyl containing vinyl monomer (D) followed by neutralising 
the carboxyl groups. This composition may be used as a 
water-dispersible coating composition. The object of this invention is to provide a room 
temperature curing composition which is not only 
satisfactory in the retention of film-forming property 
even after prolonged storage but also superior to the 
conventional composition in mechanical stability, water 
resistance, durability and white enamel gloss. After an intensive research done to accomplish the 
above object, the
