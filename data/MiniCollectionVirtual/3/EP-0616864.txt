A continuous-casting mould, comprising narrow side 
plates (7, 8) arranged between broad side plates (3), 

which narrow side plates are held by clamping forces 
applied to the broad side plates via tie rods (4) and 

the narrow side plates consisting of an end plate (8) 
defining the moulding cavity on the narrow sides and an 

end-plate support (7) are adjustable to a billet format 
via a holder and an adjustment device (5),
 
characterised in that
 
recesses are formed in the upper and lower region in 

the side faces of the end-plate support (7) adjoining 
the broad side plates (3), linear bearings (9) are 

inserted into the recesses such that they space apart 
the broad side plates (3) and absorb the clamping 

forces applied to the broad side plates. 
A continuous-casting mould according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the linear bearing (9) consists 

of a pressure plate (11) which is fastened in the 
recess, and a pressure cover (10) which is shorter in 

the direction of movement (14) of the broad side plates 
(3) than the length of the recess in this direction, 

and the remaining gap is filled with an elastomer (13) 
and rolling elements are arranged between the pressure 

plate (11) and the pressure cover (10). 
A continuous-casting mould according to Claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that the rolling elements are 

formed by cylindrical rollers (12), the axes of which 

lie at right-angles to the direction of adjustment of 
the narrow side plates (7, 8). 
A continuous-casting mould according to Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the surface of the pressure  

 
cover (10) is sized such that the pressure transmitted 

per unit of surface area by the broad-side clamping is 
lower than the compressive strength of the material of 

the broad side walls (3).
