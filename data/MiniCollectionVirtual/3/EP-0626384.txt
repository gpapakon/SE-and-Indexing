amide prostaglandin analogs which are thromboxane A₂ 
(TXA₂) receptor antagonists or combined thromboxane 
A₂ receptor antagonist/thromboxane synthetase 
inhibitors useful, for example, in the treatment of 
thrombotic and/or vasospastic diseases, and have good 
duration of action. Examples of compounds disclosed 
in Misra et al have the structural formula I  and including all stereoisomers thereof, wherein

   R¹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, 
cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, or amide 
wherein t is 1 to 12 and Ra is lower alkyl, aryl, 
cycloalkyl, or cycloalkylalkyl);
 
   R² is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl; 
or R¹ and R² together with the nitrogen to which they 
are linked may form a 5- to 8- membered ring. Misra et al disclose that these compounds may 
be prepared by transmetallating bromophenylalkyl Bby treatment with t-C₄H₉Li or n-C₄H₉Li or subjecting B 
to a Grignard reaction by treatment with Mg, and then 
condensing with the perhydro benzopyran-3-ol 
derivative or the perhydro benzofuran-1-ol derivative 
Cto form the condensed 7-oxabicycloheptane alcohol 
compound of the structure Zand then subjecting the condensed compound to 
hydrogenolysis to form the following alcohol 
Where Pro is thexyldimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl, 
the alcohol is acetylated and the silyl 
protecting group of the so-formed acetate is removed 
to form the following acetate:  which is treated with a protecting compound and the 
acetate is removed by treatment with aqueous 
hydroxide or excess methyllithium to form the 
following alcohol: 
(where Pro is t-butyldiphenylsilyl) .
 
The protected alcohol is subjected to a Jones 
oxidation to form the following acid: 
The so-formed carboxylic acid intermediate is 
then employed to make the final compound.  In a more preferred procedure, Misra et al 
disclose protecting the alcohol function of alcohol Z 
to form the protected alcohol 
subjecting the protected alcohol to a Jones oxidation 
and esterification to form the ester 
which is made to undergo hydrogenolysis and
