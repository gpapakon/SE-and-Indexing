<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biochemically-powered
self-exciting electric power source.As is known, electric batteries which are currently in
use are based on the reversibility of electrolysis and
generally require the use of materials that are considered
to be highly polluting, such as lead plates and acids for
the electrolytes.In addition to this purely ecological aspect,
currently known electric batteries, despite being
manufactured with the most advanced technologies, are
usually very heavy and have considerable operating costs.Another drawback is furthermore constituted by the
fact that they normally have a very limited endurance and
require long recharging times.The principal aim of the invention is indeed to solve
the problems described above by providing a new type of
electric power source that is based on entirely different
power supply criteria, using in practice biochemical
phenomena to generate electric power with the possibility
of continuously regenerating the source without having to
recharge it electrically as instead occurs in the known
art.Within the scope of the above aim, a particular object
of the invention is to provide an electric power source
that constitutes a new source of energy in alternative to
petroleum without having to use ecologically dangerous
elements.Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a power source having long endurance and reduced weight
with respect to conventional electric batteries.Another object of the present invention is to provide
an electric power source which can be easily obtained
starting from commonly commercially available elements and
materials and is furthermore competitive from a merely
economical point of view.This aim, these objects and others which will become
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a biochemically-powered
self-exciting electric power source according to
the invention, as defined in claims 1 and 14 and a biochemical voltage rectifier as defined in claim 24. Further
characteristics and advantages will become apparent from
the following detailed description of a preferred but not
exclusive embodiment of a biochemically-powered self-exciting
electric power source, illustrated only by way of
non-limitative example with the aid of the accompanying
drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a sectional view of the electric power
source;figure 2 is a partially cutout view of the shape of
the anode;figure 3 is a view of a biochemically-powered
rectifier;figure 4 is a schematic view of another embodiment of
the electric power
