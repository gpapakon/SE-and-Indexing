<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a package for displaying merchandise, and 
more particularly to a package for displaying a plurality of safety razors. A safety razor is of the type which comprises an elongated handle 
portion and a transverse shaving blade unit which extends from an end of the handle 
portion. A plurality of such razors are commonly displayed and merchandised in a 
single package or enclosure. In some instances, the display package is of the type 
which can be placed on a display rack and contain razors which are readily removed 
by the end user. In other instances, the razors are simply packaged in a closed plastic 
wrap. Display packages for safety razors include those described in, for 
example: U.S. Patent No. 4,266,664 to Dixon et al.; U.S. Patent No. 4,341,306 to 
Lightsey; and U.S. Patent No. 4,445,610 to Richards. U.S. Patent No. 4,266,664 
relates to a package for a plurality of razors each having an elongate handle and a 
transversely extending shaving head at the upper end. The package is formed from 
card which is cut, shaped and secured to form an envelope enclosing at least the major 
portion of the lengths of the razor handles. The opposite sides of the envelopes are 
each formed with an elongate slot, the two slots being in registry with each other to 
permit the shaving heads of the razors to project from each side of the envelope. A 
pair of flaps integral with the remainder of the package overly the projecting heads to 
each side of the envelope. Although these display packages are often adequate to 
display a plurality of nested razors, once one of the razors has been removed by a 
user, the package may cease to become an effective storage structure for the 
remaining razors. More particularly, upon removing the first nested razor, the 
remaining razors may easily dislodge from the enclosure and become displaced. It is desirable therefore, to provide a package for displaying and 
merchandising a plurality of safety razors, having structure which prohibits the 
displacement of the razors therefrom once one or more of the razors has been 
removed from the package.  
 The display package of the subject invention essentially comprises an 
enclosure for displaying a plurality of safety razors in side-by-side nested relationship. 
Each of the safety razors has an elongated handle and a transverse blade head which 
is connected to the handle. The package includes opposed front and rear panels which are 
connected to one another to define a housing for at least a portion of the
