<ABSTRACT>
Machine for electrostatically spraying a coating product, of the type comprising two pillars (1, 2), two carriages (3, 4) and a hollow beam (5) carrying at least one spray head (11, 12, 13) intended to be moved over the articles to be covered, these articles being carried by a conveyor (6). According to the invention, the hollow beam (5) is made of an electrically insulating material. The internal space of the hollow beam is divided longitudinally into two ducts separated by a common wall, the said ducts containing the pipes for supplying coating products and air for the spray heads (11, 12, 13) and the cables for supplying voltage to them.

Machine for electrostatically spraying a coating 
product, of the type including a hollow beam (5) arranged 

horizontally above objects to be covered and carrying at 
least one coating-product spray nozzle (11, 12, 13), 

characterized in that the said beam (5) is made of an 
insulating material. 
Spray machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said beam (5) contains several coating-product 

supply pipes (110) for the or each spray nozzle 
(11, 12, 13). 
Spray machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the internal space of the said hollow beam (5) is 

divided longitudinally into at least two ducts (105, 106) 
separated by a common wall (104). 
Spray machine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the said beam carries at least one unit (21, 22, 

23) for changing the coating product, preferably one such 
unit for each spray nozzle (11, 12, 13), connected to at 

least one such spray nozzle (11, 12, 13) by a length of 
hose (43) passing through an opening made between the two 

ducts (105, 106). 
Spray machine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the said beam carries at least one voltage-raising 

unit (31, 32, 33), preferably one such unit for 
each spray nozzle (11, 12, 13), connected to at least one 

such spray nozzle (11, 12, 13) by an insulated electric 
cable (63) passing through an opening formed between the 

two ducts (105, 106). 
Spray machine according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
including several spray nozzles (11, 12, 13) spaced along  

 
the said beam (5), at least some of which can move in the 

longitudinal direction of the said beam (5), characterized 
in that the said movable spray nozzles (11, 12, 13) 

are actuated by pneumatic rams (93) housed in the lower 
duct (106) which supports the spray nozzles (11, 12, 13). 
Spray machine according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
including several spray nozzles (11, 12, 13) spaced along 

the said beam (5), at least some of which can move in the 
longitudinal direction of the said beam (5), characterized 

in that the length of hose (43) supplying each 
movable spray nozzle is housed in a deformable insulating 

jacket forming a pay-out device (53). 
Spray machine according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
including several spray nozzles (11, 12, 13) spaced along 

the said beam (5), at least some of which can move in the 
longitudinal direction of the said beam (5), characterized 

in that the insulated electric cable (63) connected 
to each movable spray nozzle is housed in a deformable 

insulating jacket forming a pay-out device (73). 
Spray machine according to one of Claims 3 to 8, 
for applying electrically conductive coating products, 

characterized in that it includes insulating means 
comprising, for example, at least one electric and fluid 

separator (150, 212) and an intermediate tank (151, 201) 
which are inserted between an aforementioned unit (21, 

22, 23) for changing coating product and one or more of 
the aforementioned spray nozzles (11, 12, 13). 
Spray machine according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the spray nozzle (11, 12, 13) is placed at the 

lower end of an insulating support (200) which can move 
vertically between a raised position for cleaning/filling 

the spray nozzle (11, 12, 13) and the intermediate tank 
(201) and a lowered operating position. 
Spray machine according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the height of the spray nozzles (11, 12, 13) 

can be adjusted independently from one another. 
Spray machine according to one of Claims 3 to 11, 
characterized in that the said beam (5) forming the said 

ducts (105, 106) has a square or rectangular overall  
 

cross section. 
Spray machine according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the said beam (5) is equipped with external 

stiffening ribs (101, 102) extending along most of its 
length, the said ribs (101, 102) increasing the length of
