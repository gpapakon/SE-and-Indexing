<CLAIMS>
Centrifugal pump whose liquid-filled interior is 
sealed by a pressure cover (4), the pressure cover (4) 

being provided with an opening (5) for the penetration of 
a shaft (2), and an abutment (6) for a shaft seal constructed 

as a bearing ring seal (7) being fitted on the 
side of the pressure cover (4) facing the pump interior, 

characterized in that the pressure cover (4) is provided 
with at least two abutments (6, 10), in that the abutments 

(6, 10) are arranged on different diameters and 
offset relative to one another in the axial direction, 

and in that the radial spacing of the two abutments (6, 
10) is dimensioned to be at least so large that two 

bearing ring seals (7, 11) of different diameter can be 
fitted. 
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the bearing ring seal (7) which can be 

fitted on a smaller diameter is arranged in a directly 
sealing fashion on the drive shaft (2). 
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that one or both bearing ring seals (7, 

11) bear in a supportive fashion against the hub (9) of 
the impeller of the last pump stage. 
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the pressure cover is provided in 

the region between the abutments with connections (14) 
for a liquid line.
