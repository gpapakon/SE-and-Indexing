<DESCRIPTION>
The chemical attachment of polyalkylene glycol 
(PAG) to protein is a method of choice which confers to 
the so modified proteins new and interesting properties. 
As a general rule, PAG modified proteins exhibit 
increased stability, increased resistance to proteolytic 
inactivation, increased plasmatic half-live, decreased 
to non existent antigenicity and immunogenicity and 
lower toxicity. As a consequence of the potential usefulness of 
all these conferred properties, the covalent attachment 
of PAG chains to a variety of proteins of therapeutical 
interest has been attempted. Some of these protein 
derivatives are under clinical evaluation since they 
retain, at least partly, their biological activity. In 
March 1990, ENZON INC. even received an approval to 
market for a PEG - modified form of adenosine deaminase 
(ADAGEN™) useful in the treatment of severe combined 
immunodeficiency disease associated with adenosine 
deaminase deficiency. The therapeutical value of proteins is known 
for a long time. Historically, before the development of 
large - scale manufacturing processes for human 
recombinant proteins, most proteins used for therapy 
purposes were derived from non - human proteins and 
often induced an immune response that resulted in 
hypersensitivity or even death. As a consequence of this induced immune 
response, the protein plasmatic clearance increases and 
thus needing the use of higher doses so as to maintain 
therapeutic efficacy. It often resulted in a vicious  
 
circle of high doses inducing immune response and 
increased clearance, lack of efficacy which required 
higher doses. An increasingly growing number of recombinant 
human proteins which should not have the property of 
inducing immune response are now commercially available. 
A number of these are already in use. During the 
evaluation of these proteins, it became obvious that the 
hope recombinant technology would solve all the problems 
associated with the therapeutical use of proteins was 
not yet obtained. Indeed, some recombinant proteins such as 
Interleukin-2, contrary to the "natural" human protein, 
lack the glycosyl moiety(ies). Because of this missing 
part, the recombinant Interleukin-2 is poorly soluble, 
unstable and rapidly cleared from the plasma. In other 
cases, it was showed that glycosyl moiety removal 
demasked an epitope normally not visible by the immune 
system rendering recombinant human-proteins potentially 
immunogenic. Finally, it should be mentioned that some 
potentially useful enzymes
