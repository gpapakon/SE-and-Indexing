<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biaxially-oriented multi-layer
films, and more particularly to biaxially-oriented
multi-layer films which have excellent transparency and
low-temperature heat-sealing properties, and which are
suited for high-speed automatic packaging.Biaxially-oriented multi-layer films such as a
biaxially-oriented polypropylene film laminated with a
heat-sealing layer, are excellent in various properties
such as transparency and rigidity, so that they have been
widely used as overwrap-packaging films for foods,
tobaccos, cassette tapes, and the like. Because of the
recent developments in high-speed automatic packaging
machines, quality requirements for suitability of the
films for automatic packaging are becoming severer.The most important properties required for overwrap-packaging
films are low-temperature heat-sealing
properties. In order to impart good low-temperature heat
sealability to the films, there has been developed a
method in which a layer of a resin having excellent low-temperature
heat-sealing properties, such as a propylene-ethylene
random copolymer resin or a propylene-ethylene-butene-1
random copolymer resin, is laminated on a
biaxially-oriented polypropylene film. Further, a
significant improvement in the low-temperature heat-sealing
properties has been made by adding a second
component such as polybutene-1 to the above resin layer.Moreover, in order to meet the recent trend toward
high-speed packaging and improve suitability of the films
for high-speed packaging by improving the anti-blocking
properties of the films, there has been proposed a method
in which inorganic fine particles such as of silica or
calcium carbonate are added to the above-described resin 
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 30347/1992); and a
method in which organic fine particles such as spherical
powder of a silicone resin are added to the above-described
resin (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 233248/1987).JP-A-60-162645 discloses a composite film having a
surface layer on a polypropylene base layer. The surface
layer is comprised of an ethylene propylene copolymer, a
hydrocalcite compound and a polypropylene graft-polymerised
with ethylenic double bond-containing
carboxylic acids, the modified polypropylene having a
number average molecular weight of at least 42 000.However, a biaxially-oriented multi-layer film which
is prepared by laminating on the surface of a biaxially-oriented
polypropylene film a layer of a resin having
excellent low-temperature heat-sealing properties,
containing
