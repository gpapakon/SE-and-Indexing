<ABSTRACT>
Programming apparatus for providing an 
EEPROM programming signal, comprises a charge pump 

circuit (20) for receiving a programming input signal 
on a programming input line (14) and for charging up a 

gate drive voltage signal in response to a rising edge 
of the programming input signal. A transistor (52) 

which includes a gate coupled to the gate drive signal 
couples the programming input line (14) to a 

programming output line (130), which is coupled to an 
EEPROM. A ramp control circuit (58) including a 

capacitor (54) and a transistor (48) controlling the 
flow of current through the capacitor (54), is coupled 

to the programming output line (130) for regulating a 
ramp-up rate of a programming output signal on the 

programming output line (130). A ramp-down circuit 
(92) is coupled to the programming input line (14) and 

to the programming output line (130) and is responsive 
thereto for providing a ramp-down of the programming 

output signal after the programming input signal goes 
low.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to programming 
apparatus for a memory device, for example an EEPROM. Typically, memory circuits such as EEPROMs 
are operated at a fixed voltage, for example 5 volts, 
provided by a regulated voltage supply. The EEPROM 
circuits are characteristically programmable in 
response to a high level programming signal. The 
programming signals are generally provided at a 
voltage level higher than the normal operating voltage 
of the EEPROM, for example in the order of 14 volts. The present invention seeks to provide 
improved programming apparatus. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided programming apparatus as 
specified in claim 1. Advantageously, the invention can provide a 
ramp control circuit for use in programming a memory 
device which controls the ramp-up time of the 
programming signal to the device. Advantageously, the 
circuit may control the ramp-down time of the 
programming signal so as to prevent forward biasing of 
junctions of the memory device. Preferably, the 
programming signal ramp-up and ramp-down times are 
independent of load applied to the programming signal 
source. A low resistance path may be provided from a 
programming signal source to a memory device so as to 
minimise the voltage drop between the signal source 
and the device. A preferred embodiment comprises a charge 
pump controlling ramp-up of a gate signal in response 
to a programming signal, a transistor coupling the 
programming signal input to a programming output 
responsive to the charge pump gate signal, a ramp 
control circuit coupled to the programming output line  
 
comprising means for limiting the rate at which a 
signal on the programming output line may be ramped-up 
and a pull-down circuit for sensing a falling edge of 
the programming signal and providing controlled 
ramp-down of the programming output signal in a manner 
to avoid forward biasing of junctions of the memory 
device. This invention can be used with a typical 
EEPROM characterised by (i) normal operation at a 
fixed voltage, for example 5 volts, and (ii) 
programming operation in response to a programming 
signal at a voltage higher than the normal operating 
voltage, that is a programming signal of the order of 
14 volts. EEPROMs of this nature are well known to 
those skilled in the art. An embodiment of the present invention is 
described below, by way of example only, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
