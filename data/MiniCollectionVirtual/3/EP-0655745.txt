A method of manufacturing a tube for a nuclear
fuel rod sheath, comprising the steps of:


preparing a bar of zirconium based alloy whose
addition elements are only, by weight, 0.18% to 0.25%

iron, 0.07% to 0.13% chromium, 0.35% to 1.70% tin, 900 ppm
to 2300 ppm oxygen, 80 ppm to 200 ppm carbon, and 50 ppm

to 120 ppm silicon, the Fe/Cr ratio being in the range 1.6
to 3;
drawing the bar into a blank, in α phase;
subjecting the blank in α phase to a plurality of
successive rolling phases in α phase as tubes of progressively

decreasing thickness, each rolling being followed
with an intermediate annealing thermal treatment under an

inert atmosphere at a temperature of from 700°C to 750°C,
while the final annealing treatment is a stress releaving

heat treatment at a temperature of from 450°C to 500°C
such that the alloy be predominantly in α phase and the

heat treatment as a whole being such that ΣA be between
2.10
-17
 and 2.10
-16
, ΣA designating the sum, over all of the
heat treatments, of the products of the times t (in hours)

multiplied by exp(-Q/RT), T being the temperature in K and
Q/R being equal to 40,000 K
-1

A method according to claim 1, characterizedin
that the final stress relieving annealing passes is carried

out at a temperature of from 470°C to 500°C.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the metallurgical treatments and the intermediate

annealing heat treatments comprise:

at least a sequence comprising cold working and
reheating between 700°C and 750°C, for one to three

hours;
successive rolling steps into tubes of decreasing
thickness with intermediate re-heating under argon at a

temperature between 640°C and 740°C before the final 
stress relieving re-heating between 470°C and 500°C.
