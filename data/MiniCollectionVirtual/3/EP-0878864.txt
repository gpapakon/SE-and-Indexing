<ABSTRACT>
A chip antenna (10) includes, inside a rectangular-parallelepiped
base (11) having barium oxide, aluminum

oxide, and silica as main constituents, a conductor (12)
wound in a spiral form along the length direction of the

base (11), and an LC parallel resonance circuit (13), which
is inserted in the intermediate portion of the conductor

(12) and which is connected electrically in series with the
conductor (12), and includes, on the surface of the base

(11), a power-feeding terminal (14) for applying a voltage
to the conductor (12). The conductor (12) is separated into

a first conductor (121) and a second conductor (122) by the
LC parallel resonance circuit (13). The LC parallel

resonance circuit (13) is formed of a coil L1, which is an
inductance element, and a capacitor C1, which is a

capacitance element, which are connected in parallel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chip antenna and,
more particularly, to a chip antenna for use in a mobile
communication apparatus, such as a PHS (Personal Handy-phone
System) or a portable telephone set using the chip antenna.A print antenna which has a plurality of resonance
frequencies and which can be used at a plurality of
frequencies at the same time has been proposed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-186420. Fig. 11 shows a
conventional print antenna having a plurality of resonance
frequencies, which can be used for two frequencies. A print
antenna 50 is formed of a dielectric substrate 52 on which a
monopole element 51 whose one end is connected to a power
source V is printed. An anti-resonance circuit 54, which is
a parallel circuit of a chip inductor 53a and a chip
capacitor 53b, is inserted in the intermediate portion of
the monopole element 51, and the monopole element 51 is
separated into a first antenna element 51a and a second
antenna element 51b. The monopole element 51 resonates at a
first frequency f1 (wavelength: 位1), and the length of the
monopole element 51 at this time is approximately 1/4位.
Also, the anti-resonance circuit 54 resonates at a second
frequency f2 (wavelength: 位2). Further, since the first
antenna element 51a is made to singly resonate at the second
frequency f2, the length thereof is set at approximately
2/4位. Since the anti-resonance circuit 54 resonates at the 
second frequency f2, the print antenna constructed as
described above becomes equivalent to a state in which with
respect to the second frequency f2, the second antenna
element 51b is opened, and resonates at the first frequency
f1 and also the second frequency f2. Thus, the print
antenna has two resonance frequencies.The band width of the first and second frequencies f1
and f2 is determined by the width of the first and second
antenna elements 51a and 51b. An increase in the width
makes it possible to increase the band width of the first
and second frequencies f1 and f2.However, according to the above-described conventional
print antenna, if an attempt to realize a wider band is
made, the width of the first and second antenna elements
must be increased, causing the print antenna to become
enlarged, as a result, presenting the problem that it is
difficult to form the mobile communication apparatus which
mounts this print antenna into a smaller size. JP 08-186420 A describes a print antenna comprising a dielectric substrate forming a conductor
pattern to be resonated at a first frequency, a
