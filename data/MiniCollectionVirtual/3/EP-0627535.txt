<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for operating a lock bolt by pushing or pulling, characterised in that it includes a support (50) intended to be attached to the leaf of a door bearing the said lock, the said support (50) bearing, on the one hand, a cam (100) mounted so that it can rotate freely on a mounting plate and including a hole of square cross-section for the passage of a spindle of corresponding cross-section to be inserted into the said lock for operating the said bolt and, on the other hand, an actuating member (70) mounted so that it can pivot about an axis of rotation (102) substantially parallel to the said plate and including two spaced-apart studs (74A) whose pivoting paths extend on either side of the axis of rotation of the said cam (100). A handle forms an integral part or is mounted removably on the actuating member and elastic means are provided for compensating for angular play relative to the preorientation of the doorknob hole of the lock.
