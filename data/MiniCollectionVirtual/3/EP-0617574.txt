<ABSTRACT>
A work mounting apparatus has a head drum(4) rotated 
in one direction, work heads(17) arranged on the outer periphery 

of the drum(4), each work head(17) including a suction 
nozzle(18) projecting from the work head(17) toward a 

circular travel path(L₀), for moving along the travel 
path(L₀) while keeping a fixed orientation and repeating a 

cycloidal motion during rotation of the head drum(4), a 
work feeder(6) arranged on the travel path(L₀), and a movable 

table(22) arranged on the travel path(L₀) at a distance 
from the work feeder(6), for receiving thereon a 

printed board(9), wherein the suction nozzle(18) of each 
work head(17) sucks up a work from the work feeder(6) and 

releases the sucked work at a desired release position on 
the travel path(L₀). The movable table(22) is moved along 

a line intersecting the travel path(L₀), whereby a target 
point on the printed board(9), at which the work is to be 

mounted, is brought to the release position on the travel 

path(L₀), in cooperation with cycle control of the cycloidal 
motion of the work head(17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a work mounting apparatus 
for mounting IC chips or like electronic components, as 
works, on printed boards. A work mounting apparatus of this type is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 5,234,304, for example. This conventional 
apparatus comprises a circular worktable, a head drum 
arranged above the worktable for continuous rotation and 
having pivots extending in a radial direction thereof, 
respectively and a plurality of work heads projecting from 
the outer periphery of the head drum. Each work head is 
capable of turning around the pivot of the head drum while 
maintaining a fixed orientation with respect to the worktable, 
and a suction nozzle projects from the outer peripheral 
surface of each work head toward the worktable. The 
worktable has a work supply section and a work mounting 
section, which are arranged below the path of movement of 
the work heads and separated from each other in the circumferential 
direction of the worktable. The work mounting 
section is supplied with printed boards. The supply section of the worktable is provided with a 
number of work feeders disposed in radial form. The work 
feeders are capable of continuously supplying various 
electronic components, e.g., IC chips, resistors, capacitors, 
etc., as works, to respective supply positions on the 
worktable. The work mounting section is provided with an XY 
table, on the upper surface of which are supplied the 
printed boards on which the works are to be mounted. In the work mounting apparatus described above, as the  
 
work heads turn around their pivot during rotation of the 
head drum, the suction nozzle of each work head moves in 
the circumferential direction of the worktable, i.e., along 
the path of movement of the work heads, while making cycloidal 
motions. By appropriately setting the turning 
direction and speed of the work heads with respect to the 
circumferential speed of the head drum, the speed of the 
suction nozzle of each work head relative to the supply and 
mounting sections can be made zero at the time when the 
suction nozzle approaches closest to a supply position on 
the worktable and the printed board, that is, when the suction 
nozzle is at its lowest position. Consequently, even 
while the head drum is continuously rotated, the suction 
nozzle of each work head is able to reliably suck up a work 
on the supply position. The work retained by the suction 
nozzle moves, together with the work head, to the mounting 
section, and then is mounted to a printed board on
