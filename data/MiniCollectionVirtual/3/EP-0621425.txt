<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plug valve comprising:   - a body (3) delimiting an axisymmetric cylindrical housing (4) exhibiting in its wall (5) orifices (6, 7, 8) termed external orifices to which there runs a pipe (6a) termed inlet pipe and at least one outlet pipe (7a), and - a shut-off member (2) which, assuming its place inside the housing (4) includes an internal chamber (9) emerging at the external face of the shut-off member via at least two orifices (11, 12) termed internal orifices which are positioned so that in one specific orientation of the shut-off member (2), termed the open position, at least some of the internal orifices (11, 12) of the latter face at least some of the external orifices (6, 7) of the body of the valve (tap).   This valve is characterised in that:   - the distal end of the shut-off member (2) has an internal axial outlet orifice and - the housing emerges to the outside of the body via its two ends so that the internal orifice placed at the distal end of the shut-off member always communicates with one of the open ends of the housing.

A parallel plug valve comprising: 

a body (3) bounding a cylindrical housing (4) for rotation having, in its wall (5), 
so-called external openings (6, 7, 8) to which a so-called inlet pipe (6a) and at least one 

outlet pipe (7a) join, the said pipe being called inlet and outlet according to the direction 
of circulation of a fluid. 
a closing device (2) which, being positioned in the aforementioned housing (4) with a 
low level of running clearance, has an internal chamber (9) which opens level with the 

external surface (10) of the closing device via at least two so-called internal openings 
(11, 12) which are positioned in such a manner that in a single orientation of the closing 

device (2), called the open position, at least some of the internal openings (11, 12) of the 
said closing device are opposite at least some of the external openings (6, 7) of the body 

of the valve so that a fluid can circulate from the inlet pipe to the outlet pipe, 
sealing means (13, 14, 15) arranged between the closing device (2) and the housing (4), 
means (16) for manoeuvring the closing device (2) supported at least indirectly by the 
so-called proximal end (17) of the proximal and distal ends (17, 18) of the closing 

device (2) and 
means (19) for locking the closing device (2) in its housing (4) which are mounted on 
the said distal end (18) of the closing device, 
 
this valve being 
CHARACTERISED
 in that 

the distal end (18) of the closing device (2) has an axial opening with an internal 
outlet (40) and 
the housing opens to the exterior of the body by way of its two ends so that the 
chamber (9), by means of the internal opening positioned at the distal end (18) of the 

closing device, always connects to one of the open ends of the housing. 
A valve according to Claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the distal end (18) of the closing 
device directly supports a portion of a means (24) for detachable assembly of a 

supplementary part (25). 
A valve according to Claim 1 which, in addition to the seals (13, 14) positioned at the 
ends of the closing device, supports on the curved surface (26) of the closing device, a 

supplementary O-ring seal (15) which embraces the said curved surface and is held 
thereon by fastening means (27) 
characterised
 in that the fastening means (27) of the 
supplementary O-ring seal (15) comprise a mould (28) which, formed in the thickness of  

 
the closing device, is capable of housing a plate (29) of a substantially complementary 

shape, and the mould (28) and plate (29) have external edges (28a, 29a) shaped so as to 
form a groove (30) with its inlet reduced in width to be able to retain therein the 

supplementary seal when the plate is assembled with the mould. 
A valve according to Claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the bottom (31) of the mould (28) is 
substantially flat except in one area which is provided with means (32) for positioning 

the plate, such as a rib co-operating with a groove. 
A valve according to Claim 3 or 4 
characterised
 in that the position of the 
supplementary seal on the closing device is chosen in such a manner that, when the 

closing device is in the closed position, this seal surrounds the external inlet opening so 
that the inlet pipe is completely separated from the rest of the valve.
