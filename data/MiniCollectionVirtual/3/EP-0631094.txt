<ABSTRACT>
A boiler having a main heat exchanger (1) for 
heating water to be circulated under control of a diverter 

valve (4) through either a central heating system or a 
plate heat exchanger (2) for heating domestic hot water, 

is provided with an expansion vessel (3) including gas and 
water chambers (15, 16) separated by a diaphragm. The 

water chamber includes inlet ports (7, 8) for receiving 
returning circulated water from the plate heat exchanger 

(2) and the central heating system; and an outlet port 
(21) communicating with a pump chamber having a discharge 

port (24) connected to the inlet of the main heat 
exchanger. Thus, circulating water passes through the 

water chamber of the expansion vessel which serves as a 
manifold allowing simplification of the pipework within 

the boiler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to boilers of the kind 
having an expansion vessel and suitable for sealed, i.e. 
non open vented, water systems. In particular, the 
invention is concerned with expansion vessels, especially 
but not necessarily exclusively, suitable for use in the 
type of boiler unit known as a "combination boiler unit" 
and capable of providing hot water both for central 
heating and for consumption without need for hot water to 
be stored to be ready on demand. Expansion vessels are required in sealed hot 
water central heating systems to accommodate expansion of 
the water in the system from cold to hot without 
generating an excessive increase in water pressure in the 
system. Expansion vessels generally consist of a 
container, usually steel, of adequate strength to resist 
the maximum pressure in the system. Within this container 
is fitted a rubber diaphragm fixed to the periphery of the 
container such that it divides the volume of the container 
into two sections, namely a water chamber and a gas 
chamber. The diaphragm is free to move such that either 
of the sections can occupy all or none of the total volume 
of the vessel depending upon relative pressures within the 
sections. One section, i.e. the water chamber, has an 
inlet/outlet aperture for connection to the heating system  
 
whilst the other section is pressured with nitrogen, 
usually to a pressure of about 1 bar, thus biasing the 
diaphragm towards the water connection to reduce the 
volume of the water chamber when the system is cold. As 
the system warms up, the expansion volume of water passes 
through the connection into the vessel, forcing the 
diaphragm back and compressing the nitrogen in the gas 
chamber of the vessel. The heat output of combination boilers is often 
relatively high in order to ensure the required hot water 
performance, and the expansion vessels used in these 
boilers are relatively large, e.g. around 8 litres 
capacity. As a consequence, the expansion vessel occupies 
a substantial portion of the total space within the boiler 
casing whilst serving a relatively simple function. Due 
to a general desire for combination boilers to be of 
compact design, the necessary pipework between the 
components of the boiler is often extensively manipulated, 
leading to difficulties of access to the components and 
their servicing. The present invention addresses the foregoing 
drawbacks and provides an expansion vessel in or for a 
boiler unit having a heat exchanger for heating water to 
be circulated
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An expansion vessel in or for a boiler unit 
having a heat exchanger (1) for heating water to be 

circulated through a closed flow circuit, the expansion 
vessel comprising a container (3) divided internally by 

movable wall means (9) to form gas and water chambers (15, 
16), and a port (7, 8) for connecting the water chamber to 

the flow circuit, characterized in that a further port 
(21) opens into the water chamber (16) for connecting the 

water chamber to the flow circuit, one port being an inlet 
port and the other port being an outlet port so that water 

circulating through the flow circuit passes through the 
water chamber (16). 
An expansion vessel according to claim 1, 
wherein the container is adapted to mount a pump (22) 

thereon at one of the ports (21) for circulating water 
around the flow circuit. 
An expansion vessel according to claim 2, 
wherein the container includes pump housing means (5) 

forming at least partially a pump chamber for receiving a 
pump impeller (23) and communicating directly with said 

port (21). 
An expansion vessel according to claim 3, 
wherein said port is the outlet port (21) and the pump 

housing means includes a pump discharge port (24). 
An expansion vessel according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the movable wall means comprises a 

diaphragm (9), and a substantially rigid perforated 
partition structure (10) is located within the water 

 
chamber (16) and defines a gallery (6) interconnecting the 

inlet and outlet ports for flow of water therebetween. 
An expansion vessel according to claim 5, 
wherein the partition structure (10) is substantially 

planar. 
An expansion vessel according to claim 5 or 6, 
wherein the partition structure is a plate (10) having the 

edge thereof connected to the diaphragm (10) and provided 
with a bleed orifice (11) to allow water to pass 

therethrough. 
An expansion vessel according to any one claims 
1 to 7, wherein the container includes two parts, one 

container part including said ports and being formed as a 
casting. 
An expansion vessel according to any one of 
claims 1 to 8, wherein a further inlet port (7, 8) is 

provided for connecting the water chamber to a second 
water circulation circuit. 
A boiler including an expansion vessel as 
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the expansion 

vessel (3) is mounted alongside a main heat exchanger (1) 
of the boiler, and a secondary heat exchanger for 

receiving hot water from the main heat exchanger is 
mounted in juxtaposition to the expansion vessel and has 

an outlet connected by a substantially straight pipe to an 
inlet port (7) of the expansion vessel.
