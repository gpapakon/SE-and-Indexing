<ABSTRACT>
According to this method, there is formed on a substrate (2) intended to carry the component, a lower layer (4) and, on it, a structure (6, 8) part of which includes an opening and overhangs the lower layer, the latter is etched isotropically through the opening, a first layer (36) is deposited on the assembly resulting from the preceding steps, the said structure and then the lower layer are removed, and at least one second conducting layer (40) is deposited, a part of which is deposited on the substrate and constitutes a contact of the component, another contact resulting from a conducting deposition (34) prior to the deposition of the first layer or from the deposition of the latter then chosen to be conducting.
