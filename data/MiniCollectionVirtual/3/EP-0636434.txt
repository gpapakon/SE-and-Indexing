<ABSTRACT>
In order to weld a preferably cylindrical body (3) to another tubular body (1), the proposal is to produce a recess (5) as a receptacle for the body (3) to be welded on by means of a punch (8) by pressing the said punch in, splitting the outer circumference of the tubular body (1) in the process.

<CLAIMS>
A method of connecting two tubular members (1, 3) by making an 
indentation in one tubular member (1) and inserting a second, preferably 

cylindrical member (3) and securing it by welding, and the indentation (5) in 
the tubular member is made in its outer periphery without cutting, by 

pressing in a rectangular punch, characterised in that 

before the indentation (5) is made, an opening (16 - 19) is formed on 
the outer periphery of the tubular member (1), 
the outer periphery of the indentation (5) in the tubular member is 
formed without cutting, by pressing a rectangular punch (8) and 

simultaneously severing the longitudinal fibres of the material in the 
region of the indentation (5), at least one end of the severed cuts 

lying in the opening (16 - 19), and whereby a longitudinal side of the 
rectangular punch (8) disposed transversely to the tubular member 

corresponds to the outer diameter of the tubular member (1) for 
pressing in, whereas its narrow side corresponds to the shape of the 

member (3) for insertion, and 
the second member (3) is inserted and secured. 
A method according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the opening (16 - 19) is made by drilling or punching. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that after the indentation (5) has been made, a flat part (20) 

is made in its side region by pressing in. 
A device for working the step in the process for producing an indentation (5)  
 

on the periphery of a tubular member (1) for receiving a second, preferably 
cylindrical, member (3) according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised by 


a two-part mould (4) for receiving the tubular member (1), the mould 
(4) surrounding the tubular member (1) on all sides except for the 

region where the indentation (5) is made, and 
a rectangular punch (8) for producing the indentation (5), guided in 
the mould (4), and a machining endface (9) which has an apex in the 

form of a cutting edge for severing the longitudinal fibres of the 
material, wherein a longitudinal side of the rectangular punch (8) 

extends transversely to the tubular member and corresponds to the 
outer diameter of the tubular member (1) for indenting, whereas the 

narrow side of the punch corresponds to the shape of the member (3) 
for inserting. 
A device according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that a projecting square tip (10) with lateral cutting edges 

(11 - 14) is formed in the centre of the machining end (9) of the punch (8). 
A device according to claim 4 or claim 5,
 
characterised in that in order to produce a flat part (20) on the tubular 

member (1) formed with an indentation (5), an additional two-part mould 
(21) is provided and encloses the tubular member (1) on all sides except for 

the region in which the indentation (5) is made and the flat part (20) is 
produced; a first punch (24) is provided and has an endface corresponding 

to the contour of the member (3) for inserting and welding, and a second 
punch (25) is provided for movement in the mould and has a flat or curved 

endface for producing the flat part (20). 
A device according to claim 6,
  
 

characterised in that the first punch (24) serves as a clamp or press pad for 
producing the flat part (20).
