<ABSTRACT>
Reinforcing sections (36,38) are provided at an outer surface 
(34) and at an inner surface (32) of a tyre (20) for a roll wheel 

assembly used in a pulverizer for crushing a material such as coal. 
These reinforcing sections (36,38) cause the tyre to be asymmetrical 

and are located on the tyre only at areas where the wearing of the tyre 
is highly predictable. The reinforcing section (38) provided on the 

inner surface (32) of the tyre (20) is provided directly opposite the 
reinforcing section (36) on the outer surface for preventing the 

localized thinning of the tyre and extending the time interval between 
rotation and/or replacement of the tyre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tyres used in a roll wheel
assembly in a pulverizer for crushing material such as coal.Pulverizers are commonly used to grind various materials in the
coal processing, ceramic, and chemical industries. A roll and race
pulverizer uses grinding elements comprising a plurality of roll wheel
assemblies or tyres suspended from driving arms and which rotate around
their respective axes of rotation through contact against a grinding
ring or race for grinding and reducing the size of the incoming
material, particularly coal. Each grinding element or roll wheel
assembly uses a replaceable outer tyre. Currently, the replaceable
outer tyres used in the roll wheel assemblies are manufactured from
alloy as a casting and are symmetrical about a radial centre plane.Despite the symmetrical orientation of the replaceable outer
tyres of the roll wheel assemblies, the tyres wear unevenly during
normal pulverizer operation. The problem with uneven wear can be
resolved by assembly rotation; i.e., a side-to-side reversal of the
partly worn tyre comprising each roll wheel assembly. However, to
perform this operation the pulverizer has to be stopped and taken out
of service for a significant period of time. The task of pulverizer
tyre rotation requires removal of the entire roll wheel assembly from
the pulverizer through an access door. This is a difficult and labour
intensive operation; special equipment is required because each roll
assembly can weigh as much as 35,000 pounds (16,000 kg). Once removed
from the pulverizer, the tyres must be disassembled from the roll wheel
assemblies by performing a heating operation. This raises the
possibility of local overheating and resultant cracking, which will
require the tyre to be repaired, if possible, or replaced.
Additionally, only a slight improvement in useful tyre life is achieved
through this tyre rotation procedure, and it is generally not enough to
justify the costs involved.Thus a need exists for an improved pulverizer tyre for a roll
wheel assembly that can provide increased wear life at minimal
additional cost.European Patent Application No. EP-A-0 110 191 discloses a
trimetal pulverizer roll for use in a bowl mill. The core material of 
the trimetal roll is a relatively soft material having good
machinability. An intermediate layer is fabricated from a material
having medium wear resistance. The outer layer of the roll is made of
a material having highly abrasive resistant qualities.According to one aspect of the invention there is

<CLAIMS>
A tyre (20) for a roll wheel assembly (14) used to crush material
in a pulverizer (10), the tyre (20) having an asymmetrical outside

diameter outer surface for contacting and crushing the material, the
tyre (20) comprising:


a first reinforcing section (36) on the outer surface of the tyre
providing the asymmetrical outside diameter outer surface at a location

where the tyre is subjected to wearing due to performing the crushing
of the material; and
a second reinforcing section (38) on an inner surface (32) of the
tyre directly opposite the location where the tyre is subjected to

wearing for minimizing localized thinning of the tyre.
A tyre (20) according to claim 1, wherein the reinforcing
sections (36,38) are at areas where the tyre wearing is predictable.
A tyre (20) according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the tyre
(20) is made of an alloy.
A tyre (20) according to claim 3, wherein the reinforcing
sections (36,38) are made of the same alloy as the tyre (20).
A tyre according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the
reinforcing sections (36,38) are made of a different material to that

of the tyre (20).
A method of prolonging the use of a tyre (20) of a roll wheel
assembly (14) for a pulverizer (10) used for contacting and crushing a

material, the method comprising:

providing a reinforcing section (36) on an outer surface of the
tyre (20) to provide an asymmetrical outside diameter outer surface on

the tyre (20) at a location where the tyre (20) is subjected to wearing
due to performing the crushing of the material; and
providing a reinforcing section (38) on an inner surface (32) of
the tyre (20) directly opposite the location where the tyre is

subjected to wearing for minimizing localized thinning of the tyre.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the reinforcing sections
(36,38) are created by adding at areas on the tyre (20) where the tyre

wearing is predictable.
A method according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the thickness
of the tyre (20) is increased by about 30% after providing the

reinforcing sections (36,38) on the tyre.
A method according to claim 8, wherein the weight of the tyre
(20) is increased by not more than 10% after providing the reinforcing

sections (36,38) on the tyre.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein the
reinforcing sections (36,38) are created by affixing additional

material by means of weld deposition to an existing tyre (20).
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein the
reinforcing sections (36,38) are created by casting them as part of the

tyre (20) in an as-cast configuration.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein the

placed in a casting mould prior to providing molten metal forming the
balance of the tyre (20) so as to composite cast them into the tyre.
