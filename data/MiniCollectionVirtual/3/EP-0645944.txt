<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an operating device for electric lamps, comprising a closed housing (1) with a metallic base plate (2) and an electric circuit which is mounted in the interior of the housing (1) on a mounting board (plate) (3). The operating device has a feed opening (filler neck) (4) which extends into the interior space and which preferably extends up to a perforation (3a) in the mounting plate (3). The feed opening (4) permits the casting compound to be filled in, in particular in the region between the mounting board and the base plate (2), without bubbles.

<CLAIMS>
Operating device for electric lamps, comprising
a closed housing (1) and an electric circuit, the housing

(1) having a metallic base plate (2), the electric
circuit being mounted in the interior (5) of the housing

(1) on a mounting plate (3), and the housing (1) being
filled partly or entirely with a heat-conducting casting

compound, characterized in that the operating device has
a tubular filler stub (4) for the casting compound, which

stub is attached to or integrally formed on the housing
wall and extends into the interior (5) of the housing

(1), the compartments (5a, 5b) of the interior (5) which
are formed by the mounting plate (3) being

interconnected.
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the mounting plate (3) has

at least one cutout or one opening (3a), the filler stub
(4) extending at least up to the cutout or up to the

opening (3a) in the mounting plate (3).
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the mounting plate

(3) extends parallel to the base plate (2), and the
filler stub (4) is attached to or integrally formed on

the housing wall opposite the base plate (2).
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the filler stub (4)

extends as far as into the compartment (5b) bounded by
the mounting plate (3), the base plate (2) and the side

walls of the housing (1).
