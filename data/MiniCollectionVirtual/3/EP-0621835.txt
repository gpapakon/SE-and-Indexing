A pump for anti-lock hydraulic braking systems, including 
a pressure valve (10) which is formed within a carrier 

element (36) adapted to be inserted into the pump casing, 
with the carrier element (36) comprising a channel (49) 

leading to a chamber (40) which, in turn, through a 
restrictor (17), is connected to the brake circuit to be 

energized, with the carrier element (36) substantially 

being of cylindrical configuration, with the channel (49) 
leading to the side wall of the cylinder, and the carrier 

element (36), in part, being inserted into a cup-shaped 
retaining member, and with the outer diameter of the 

carrier element (36) being only slightly smaller than the 
inside diameter of the retaining member,
characterized
 in that, vertically relative to 
the axis (31), which in each case accommodates a pump 

piston (32) in the pump housing (30) driven by an 
eccentric (33), each one stepped blind-end bore (35) is 

provided to communicate with a pump chamber (34), in that 
the blind-end bore (35) in each case accommodates a 

carrier element (36) retained by a bowl-shaped closure 
member (39), and in that a piston (18) is abuttable on the 

carrier element (36) which, in coaxial arrangement 
relative to the carrier element (36) and under the effect 

of an only slightly preloaded spring (63), during brake 
slip control, bears against a backward stop of the closure 

member (39) in the chamber (40) and keeps a transitory 
reservoir (15) filled until the pressure of the master 

brake cylinder (1) prevailing downstream of a check valve 
(16) and in the carrier element (36) has dropped below the  

 
valve opening pressure of the downstream opening check 

valve (16). 
A pump as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the carrier (36) 
contains a blind-end bore in which is inserted an insert 

member (52) along with the restrictor (17). 
A pump as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that a filter (54) is 
arranged ahead of the insert element (52). 
A pump as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that a check valve (16) is 
provided in the chamber in the valve carrier (36) confined 

by the insert member (52).
