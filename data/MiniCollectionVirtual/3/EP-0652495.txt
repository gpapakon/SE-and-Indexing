<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning method and apparatus that provides continuous 
lubrication to the cleaning blade (20) preventing blade failure. 

The continuous 
lubrication is provided by a foam lubricating roll (60) located 

downstream from 
the cleaning blade (20), in the direction of motion of the imaging 

surface (11). The 
foam roll (60) utilizes the waste toner cleaned from the imaging 

surface to 
lubricate the cleaning blade (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrophotographic
printing, and more particularly, to lubrication in a cleaner
apparatus that removes particles adhering to an imaging surface
(i.e.photoreceptororphotoconductor).More specifically, the invention relates to a
method for lubricating a cleaning blade
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to
an apparatus for cleaning a moving surface having
toner particles thereon according to the preamble of claim 4.In an electrophotographic application such as xerography, a
charge retentive surface is electrostatically charged, and exposed to a light
pattern of an original image to be reproduced to selectively discharge the
surface in accordance therewith. The resulting pattern of charged and
discharged areas on that surface form an electrostatic charge pattern (an
electrostatic latent image) conforming to the original image. The latent
image is developed by contacting it with a finely divided electrostatically
attractable powder referred to as "toner". Toner is held on the image
areas by the electrostatic charge on the surface. Thus, a toner image is
produced in conformity with a light image of the original being
reproduced. The toner image may then be transferred to a substrate (eg.
paper), and the image affixed to form a permanent record of the image to
be reproduced. Subsequent to development, excess toner left on the
charge retentive surface is cleaned from the surface. The process is well
known, and useful, for light lens copying from an original and printing
applications from electronically generated or stored originals, where a
charge surface may be imagewise discharged in a variety of ways. Ion
projection devices, where a charge is imagewise deposited on a charge
retentive substrate, operates similarly.In a reproduction process of the type as described above, it is
inevitable that some residual toner will remain on the photoconductor
surface after the toner image has been transferred to the sheet of support 
material (eg. paper). It has been found that with such a process the forces
holding some of the toner particles to the imaging surface are stronger
than the transfer force and, therefore, some of the particles remain on the
surface after transfer of the toner image. In addition to the residual toner,
other particles, such as paper debris (i.e. Kaolin, fibers, clay), additives and
plastic, are left behind on the surface after image transfer. (Hereinafter,
the term "residual particles" encompasses residual toner and other residual
debris remaining after
