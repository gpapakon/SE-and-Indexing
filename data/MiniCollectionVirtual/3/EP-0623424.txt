<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive member comprising an electrically conductive or 
non-conductive open, porous layer comprising a nonwoven fabric (2) 

supporting 
a metal structure (3) which carries an abrasive material (6). 

The porous layer (2), 
at a side thereof not containing abrasive material, may be provided with 

a backing layer (4) having heat conductive properties. Further, the 
porous 

layer may consist of two or more layers (2 
&
 10) stacked together, at 
least one of 

these layers being a nonwoven fabric. Such an abrasive member is 
excellently suitable for heavy duty dry-grinding operations, such as the 

grinding of granite. The abrasive metal structure can be applied onto and 
through the porous layer by an electroplating or electro-deposition 

process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to abrasive members comprising a
open, porous layer of a
nonwoven fabric supporting a metal structure which carries an abrasive
material. Such abrasive members are known from EP-A-5108235 where it is
stated that the porous layer supporting the metal structure can be,
amongst others, a nonwoven material. In a method for making such an
abrasive member, the metal structure is formed by electroplating or
electrodeposition on the porous layer in the presence of abrasive
material, such that the metal structure penetrates at least partially
through the holes or pores of the porous layer.Abrasive members of this type are typically used for the
purpose of removing stock and in the fine grinding or smoothing of hard
materials such as glass, hard plastics, metal and other hard materials
such as stone. Dependent on a particular operation and/or the shape and
curvature of an object to be treated, the abrasive member may take the
form of a flexible, semiflexible or rigid body such as a disc, sheet,
handpad, block, tape or endless belt etc.The metal structure and abrasive material are usually applied
to the porous layer by an electroplating or electro-deposition process.
Electroplating or electro-deposition of a metallic coating on an
electrode is a technology well-known in the art, such as for example
described in GB-A-8,447 (Elkington et al. 1840). Electroplating is
essentially a surface treatment. The material to be treated is made the
cathode in an electroplating metal containing electrolyte solution or
bath. By connecting a DC power source with its positive pole to an anode
in the bath and its negative pole to the cathode, the metal is reduced
from the bath and deposited onto the cathode.GB-A-1,375,571 (Prowse) discloses a method of making an
abrasive member of the type mentioned above, wherein the porous layer
supporting the metal structure is a metallic or non-metallic flexible,
semiflexible or rigid layer of mesh material or a sheet metal object,
having a solid or perforated surface.GB-B-2,223,966 (Diaforce Ltd.) relates to the making of an
abrasive member wherein the porous layer is an electrically conductive
flexible mesh material.EP-B-0,013,486 (Interface Developments Ltd.) discloses a method
of making a flexible abrasive member by electrodeposition of an abrasive
metal structure onto a porous layer of electrically non-conductive mesh 
material such as woven fibre cloth or fabric.Woven fabrics are made by interlacing and looping or knotting
together yarns or fibres in a highly regular
