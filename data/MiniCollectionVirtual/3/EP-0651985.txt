<ABSTRACT>
A novel two piece dressing having a baseplate 
and wound fluid absorbing material is provided 

according to the present invention. The baseplate is 
provided with slits or incisions for covering, 

examining and/or treating the wound without removing 
the baseplate. The dressing contains an absorbent 

material designed to remove excess exudate from the 
wound through an aperture in the baseplate. The 

incisions or slits may, in one embodiment, extend 
from the aperture and define one or more flaps for 

viewing and/or treating the wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wound
dressing that is useful for the treatment of wounds
and particularly concerns a dressing especially
suitable for decubitus and in particular leg ulcers.In connection with the care and treatment of
wound it is preferable that the selection and the
design of a wound dressing focus on the specific
requirement of the particular wound itself. The term
wound is meant to include burns, pressure sores,
punctures, ulcers and the like. A critical aspect of
wound care is consideration of the requirements of
the epithelium i.e. that area of new cell growth
directly peripheral to the wound which is formed
during the healing process so that healing is
facilitated. Another consideration in wound treatment
albeit of a somewhat lesser concern are the needs of
the surrounding unwounded skin.Since it is recognized that healing of the
wound occurs in the epithelium by cell growth from
the periphery inward, care is taken not to
unnecessarily damage or irritate this new area of
growth. Frequently, with prior art dressings,
problems can occur during dressing changes
particularly where the dressing adheres to the
epithelium or where the granulation tissue and new
cell growth becomes intertwined within the matrix of
the dressing. In both instances, there is a risk 
that removal of the dressing will damage the
sensitive tissue thereby causing a regression in
progress of wound healing. Another concern in the
selection of wound dressing is to provide a dressing
that maintains a moist environment and prevents scab
formation.At least a portion of the area of the skin
around the wound that has not been damaged by the
wound is in contact with the wound dressing. For
example, a significant portion of the surrounding
skin may be covered for extended periods with the
adhesive or a wrap which secures the dressing in
position. The unwounded skin may be irritated by the
dressing. This is particularly a problem with ulcers
specifically leg ulcers where the surrounding skin
can easily become sensitized by strong medicaments
and such wounds are frequently accompanied with
flaking, and/or scaling of the surrounding tissues or
eczema.Another factor in wound care is the frequency
of dressing changes. The above are all
considerations in the timing of dressing change. In
addition, it is desirable to change dressing more
frequently where the wound is emitting a large volume
of exudate. Thus, considering the various types of
wound, the numerous dressings that are available, and
the various stages of healing,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A two-piece wound dressing(10) comprising an
adhesive baseplate(12) and means for absorbing excess wound

exudate(14), said baseplate(12) having an aperture(15)
characterised in that said baseplate(12)has a first,

closeable aperture(15) defined by at least one slit (34,36)
through the baseplate(12), the first aperture(15) being

substantially the size of the wound for wound access and
visualization, and a second aperture(16) substantially

smaller than the dimensions of the wound and adapted to
provide direct exudate flow to said absorbing means(14).
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said baseplate(12) has a pair of slits(34,36) extending from

said second aperture(16).
The dressing(10) of claim 2 characterised in that
said pair of slits(34,36) have a further slit (38,40) at

their end opposite said second aperture(16) said slits
forming one or more flaps.
The dressing(10) of claim 3 characterised in that
said flap when released after viewing the wound forms an

occlusive surface.
The dressing(10) of claim 3 characterised in that
an edge on one side of said slit(34,36) adheres to an edge

on the opposite side of said slit(34,36).
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said adhesive contains a hydrocolloid.
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said baseplate(12) has at least two slits(34,36) forming at

least two sides of a polygon wherein the remaining side of
said polygon is the imaginary line extending from the ends

of the slits that form said polygon.
The dressing(10) of claim 7 characterised in that
said polygon is a rectangle.
The dressing(10) of claim 7 characterised in that
said polygon is a triangle. 
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said adhesive has a thickness of about 2.54·10
-5
 mm to about
2.54·10
-3
 mm (0.001 mil to about 0.1 mil).
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said adhesive mass is a hydrocolloid, hydrogel, acrylic,

polyurethane.
The dressing(10) of claim 1 characterised in that
said adhesive mass contains an antimicrobial or wound

healing agent.
