<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for driving gas discharge lamps has a bandpass filter coupled between the output of the inverter (112) and the inverter control. The bandpass filter provides protection against the diode operation of the gas discharge lamps. The bandpass filter is composed of a capacitor (180) and the permeance inductance of a transformer (134).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the driving of gas discharge
lamp loads, and particularly, though not exclusively, to the
driving of fluorescent lamps.In some electronic ballast circuits used to drive gas
discharge lamps, a rectifier converts AC power to DC power. A
two transistor inverter then converts the DC power to AC
power at a very high frequency, usually on the order of 30 KHz.
The AC power is coupled to the lamps, usually via a
transformer. A feedback circuit uses the transformer to
synchronize the opening and closing of the transistors. One
such circuit for driving an array of gas discharge lamps is
shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,124,619.Such an arrangement is efficient. However, the circuit is
susceptible to "cross conduction". If both transistors are on at
the same time, a direct short across the output of the rectifier
results. This, in turn, results in component failure.U.S. Patent No. 5,138,236 discusses an arrangement in
which a linear, non-saturating feedback transformer is used to
provide more stable, reliable switching of the inverter
transistors. The disclosed arrangement significantly reduces
the likelihood of cross-conduction in the inverter transistors
when the lamps are operating in a normal fashion.U.S. Patent No. 5, 055, 747 discloses a ballast having a no
load protection circuit in which a tuning capacitor is placed in
parallel with the secondary winding of the output transformer.
It is claimed that the no load protection circuit, operating in
conjunction with other elements, protects the ballast by
maintaining the ballast output voltage at a predetermined
value when the lamp is electrically removed from the ballast
output. Lamp failure presents an opportunity for cross-conduction.
When a gas discharge lamp begins to fail, it
operates likes a diode. The result is that the current though
the lamp has a "clipped" sinusoid waveform. The clipped
sinusoid waveform effects the current in the transformer,
thus impacting the feedback circuit that controls the inverter
transistors. This problem is mentioned in US-A-5 055 747. Absent a protection circuit, cross conduction
results, and inverter components may fail.In accordance with the invention there is provided a
circuit as set forth in the independant claim.FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram for a gas discharge
lamp drive circuit.FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of a protection circuit
for the gas discharge lamp circuit where the primary of the
transformer is shown as an ideal transformer, a permeance
inductor and a leakance inductor.Referring
