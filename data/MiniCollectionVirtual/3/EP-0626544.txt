<ABSTRACT>
A heat generator with biomass combustion, comprising a 
biomass container (1) and a combustion chamber (4) which 

are comprised within a jacket (6) for fluid to be heated, 
characterized in that it comprises two couplings (7,9) for 

the outflow of the heated fluid which are connected to a 
single manifold (11); the first coupling (7), always open, 

is arranged substantially at the level of the base of the 
biomass container, and the second coupling (9) is 

controlled by a thermal expansion valve (10) and located 
substantially at the top of the jacket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat generator with 
biomass combustion. The development level achieved by heat generators used 
to heat a fluid, very often water, to be sent to heating 
systems, in which the combustion of biomasses (usually 
wood) occurs, is known, see EP-A-0 205 993. These generators comprise a biomass container in 
which said biomass gasifies; the gas thus formed, after 
flowing through the bed of embers which naturally is at the 
base of the container, receives the addition of comburent 
in an appropriate burner and burns in a combustion chamber 
arranged below or to the side of the container; said 
container is thus always located in an elevated position, 
within the generator, with respect to said burner. The biomass container and the combustion chamber are 
comprised within a structure which has a peripheral jacket 
for containing the fluid to be heated and a fume circuit 
for exchanging the heat of the products of combustion with 
the fluid to be heated before sending them to the stack. In the known art, the cold fluid enters the jacket 
substantially at the base thereof, and the outlet for the 
heated fluid is located at the top of said jacket; 
accordingly, throughout the steps during which the 
generator produces low-temperature fluid, the biomass 
container is surrounded by a fluid which, due to its low 
temperature, causes the gases that form to condense on the 
walls of the container. This phenomenon is intense due to the large percentage  
 
of moisture contained in the gases, and leads to high 
corrosion of the metal wall which delimits the container. Also known from EP-A-0 205 993 is a heat generator 
as defined in the preamble of claim 1. The aim of the present invention is therefore to 
provide a heat generator with biomass combustion in which 
condensation of the gases which form inside the biomass 
container is prevented. The above aim is achieved by a heat generator as defined in the appended claims. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of some preferred embodiments 
thereof, illustrated only by way of examples 
in the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a schematic view of a first embodiment of 
the invention; figure 2 is a further schematic view of a different 
embodiment of the invention. With reference to figure 1, the reference numeral 1 
designates the biomass container, provided with the loading 
door 2 and connected, by means of a burner 3 which is not

<CLAIMS>
Heat generator with biomass combustion, comprising a 
biomass container (1,12) which is connected to a combustion 

chamber (4,13) by means of a burner (3,14), said container (1,12) 
and said combustion chamber (4,13) being comprised within a 

structure having a peripheral jacket (6,15) for containing 
fluid to be heated, with a cold-fluid inlet located at a 

coupling (7,16) arranged substantially at the bottom of said 
jacket (6,15), and a heated-fluid outlet located at a 

coupling (9,18) arranged substantially at the top of said 
jacket (6,15), 
characterized in that
 it comprises a further 
coupling (8,17) for the outflow of the heated fluid from the 

jacket (6,15), each of said couplings (8,9,17,18) for the 
outflow of heated fluid being connected to a single manifold 

(11,20), a first one of said couplings (8,17) being always 
open and arranged substantially at the level of the base of 

the biomass container (1,12), a second one of said couplings 
(9,18) being controlled by a thermal expansion valve 

(10,19). 
Heat generator according to claim 1, characterized 
in that it comprises a duct (21) which connects the top of 

the jacket (6,15) for containing the fluid to be heated to 
the region of said jacket (6,15) which is located substantially at 

the level of the base of the biomass container (1,12), said 
duct (21) comprising a pump (22) for circulating the fluid 

from the top of the jacket toward the region at the level of 
the base of the biomass container (1,12).
