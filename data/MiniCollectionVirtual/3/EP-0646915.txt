<ABSTRACT>
In an ATF tracking control system operative to 
automatically determine the polarity of a tracking error 

signal in a digital signal magnetic recording/reproducing 
system, a digital signal undergoes digital modulation 

in such a manner that a frequency spectrum of a 
digital signal (F0) recorded on a first track (T0) has 

dips at predetermined frequencies (f1, f2), a frequency 
spectrum of a digital signal (F1) recorded on a second 

track (T1) has a peak at the frequency (f1) and a dip at 
the frequency (f2), a frequency spectrum of a digital 

signal (F0) recorded on a third track (T2) has dips at 
the frequencies (f1, f2) and a frequency spectrum of a 

digital signal (F2) on a fourth track (T3) has a peak at 
the second frequency (f2) and a dip at the first 

frequency (f1). Heads (A, B) scan the first to fourth 
tracks (T0, T1, T2, T3) alternately sequentially. The 

frequencies (f1, f2) are utilized as pilot signals for 
tracking control. A tracking error is determined on the 

basis of a difference in level between pilot signals 
contained in crosstalk signals from tracks adjacent to a 

track scanned with the head (A). The polarity of the 
tracking error is alternately switched by a switching 

signal generated on the basis of a reproduction signal 
by the head (B) to provide a tracking error signal (V
E
). 
The travel speed of the magnetic tape is controlled in 

accordance with the tracking error signal such that the 
tracking error is rendered to be zero. In order to  

 
eliminate a difference in level between pilot signals 

recorded on the tracks, a variable gain amplifier (70) 
adjusts the signal level of any one of pilot signals 

(f1, f2) produced when the head (B) traces a track and 
another track, in such a manner that peak levels of the 

pilot signals are rendered to be equal to each other. 
As the pilot signals to be detected, any one kind of f1 

and f2 pilot signals alone can be used. In an ATF 
tracking control system operable in the variable speed 

reproduction mode, heads (A, B) can pick up crosstalk 
signals and a timing for tracking control is set 

precedently in accordance with a reproduction speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ATF 
(Automatic Track Finding) tracking control system in a 
digital VTR for consumer use. Recently, while digitization of disks and 
tapes as represented by, for example, CD's and DAT's, 
respectively, has played a leading role in the field of 
audio technology, digitization aiming at attainment of 
higher quality than in high-fidelity VTR has been 
proceeded with also in the field of public VTR. Irrespective of the digital VTR for public 
use, tracking control of the head for use with tape 
media is an important technique. A variety of tracking 
control schemes have been adopted in conformity with 
recording media. For example, as well known in the art, 
the CTL scheme has been employed in VHS-VTR, the 4-frequency 
ATF in 8mm VTR and the area division scheme in 
DAT. For tracking control in the digital VTR for 
consumer use, the employment of a control scheme as 
disclosed in, for example, Japanese patent application 
un-examined publication No. JP-A-4-255969 has been 
considered which can increase recording density and 
permit DFT control meeting diversity. Japanese patent application un-examined  
 
publications (Kokai) Nos. JP-A-4-268258, JP-A-5-95291, 
and JP-A-5-284034 disclose the circuit structures in the 
24-25 modulation digital recording method for the 
digital multiple ATF system. In the digital recording scheme disclosed in 
Japanese patent application un-examined publication 
(Kokai) No. JP-A-4-255969, digital information data as 
it is not recorded on a magnetic medium but an original 
signal is subjected to a specified signal processing 
based on digital modulation and then recorded. For example, a continuous original digital 
information signal is divided every 24 bits. Then, two 
kinds of data of 25 bits are prepared by adding one bit 
of "0" or "1" to the head of each of the 24-bit data 
pieces (information words). Each 25-bit data piece is 2T (T indicates one 
bit delay) pre-coded. A digital signal of the 2T-pre-coded 
25-bit data piece has a frequency spectrum 
containing a peak or dip of a specified frequency 
component. The pre-coded 25-bit digital signal is sorted 
into a digital information signal F0 having a frequency 
spectrum containing dips at f1 and f2, a digital information 
signal F1 having a peak at f1, and a digital 
information signal F2 having a peak at f2. Figs.1A to 
1C show frequency spectra of the digital information 
signals F0, F1 and F2, respectively. Signals are 
recorded on a recording medium such as a magnetic tape  
 
in
