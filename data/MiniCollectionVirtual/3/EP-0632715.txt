Cosmetic composition intended for holding the 
hair, characterized in that it contains, in a 

cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one milk protein 
and/or milk protein hydrolysate and at least one keratin 

hydrolysate of molecular weight between 100 and 200,000. 
Composition according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the keratin hydrolysate is obtained by hydrolysis 

of keratin originating from hair, wool, skin, bristles, 
silks, feathers, scales, hooves or horn, and can contain 

quaternary groups grafted on the peptide chain or at the 
end of the chain. 
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the keratin hydrolysate is chosen from: 


(i) hydrolysates of molecular weight approximately 
100,000 obtained by moderate hydrolysis of bovine hoof 

keratin; 
(ii) hydrolysates of molecular weight approximately 
150 obtained by controlled acid hydrolysis; 
(iii) hydrolysates containing, on their peptide 
chain, quaternary ammonium groups comprising at least one 

C₁₀-C₁₈ fatty chain. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the milk proteins are chosen 

from caseins and whey proteins obtained from cow's milk 
or from milk by-products resulting from cheese- or 

buttermaking, or their hydrolysates. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the milk proteins are chosen 

from: 

(i) caseins obtained from skimmed milk by precipitation, 
by acid treatment, by lactic fermentation or 

using rennet, and then dried, or their hydrolysates; 
(ii) whey proteins, separated from whey by 
ultrafiltration, electrodialysis, ion exchange chromatography, 

size exclusion chromatography, or their hydrolysates; 
(iii) buttermilk proteins or their hydrolysates; 
(iv) so-called "total" proteins obtained from  
 

skimmed milk, or their hydrolysates;
 
   as well as the mixtures thereof. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that it contains at least from 0.02 

to 15% by weight of milk protein and/or of milk protein 
hydrolysate and at least from 0.1 to 10% by weight of 

keratin hydrolysate, relative to the total weight of the 
composition. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that it takes the form of an agueous 

or aqueous-alcoholic lotion, thickened or otherwise, or 
the form of a gel. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that it is packaged in the form of a 

pump bottle for application in the form of an atomization 
or spray, or packaged as an aerosol for application in 

the form of a spray or mousse. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the cosmetically acceptable 

medium contains water and/or an organic solvent chosen 
from monohydric alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and 

polyhydric alcohols, used alone or mixed, said solvent 
being present in proportions not exceeding 50% by weight 

relative to the total weight of the composition. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that it contains additives compatible 

with the milk proteins, their hydrolysates and the 
keratin hydrolysates, chosen from emollients, lubricants, 

penetrating agents, stabilizers, perfumes, thickening 
agents, preservatives, 
plasticizers, cationic agents, 
polymers, silicones or animal or vegetable proteins, 

optionally quaternized, other than those defined in 
claims 4 and 5. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that it contains from 0.05 to 5% by 

weight, and preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight, relative 
to the total weight of the composition, of a thickening 

agent chosen from acrylic acid polymers, crosslinked or 
otherwise, cellulose derivatives or high molecular weight  

 
ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymers. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
11, packaged as an aerosol for application in the form of 

a spray or mousse, characterized in that it contains a 
propellent agent chosen from n-butane, propane, isobutane 

or the mixtures thereof, or a mixture of these hydrocarbons 
with chlorinated and/or fluorinated hydrocarbons; 

chlorinated and/or fluorinated hydrocarbons or the 
mixtures thereof; carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide. 
Composition according to claim 12, characterized 
in that it contains a propellent agent chosen from a 

mixture of n-butane, isobutane, propane and monofluorotrichloromethane, 
or a mixture of n-butane, propane and 

isobutane. 
Composition packaged as an aerosol for application 
in the form of a spray, according to claim 12 or 

13, characterized in that it contains from 20 to 80% by 
weight of propellent agent relative to the total weight 

of the composition. 
Composition packaged as an aerosol for application 
in the form of a mousse, according to claim 12 or 

13, characterized in that it contains from 2 to 15% by 
weight of propellent agent relative to the total weight 

of the composition. 
Composition according to any one of claims 1 to 
15, characterized in that it is used for the shaping of 

hair or the fixing of hair as a treatment product which 
can be applied after dyeing or bleaching, after shampooing 

or after permanent-waving or straightening of hair. 
Composition according to claim 16 for the shaping 
of hair, characterized in that the total concentration of 

milk protein and/or of milk protein hydrolysate and of 
keratin hydrolysate is between 0.1 and 5% by weight
