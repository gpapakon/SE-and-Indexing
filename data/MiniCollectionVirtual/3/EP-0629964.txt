<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for forming a synthesized optical 
image with all of the desired objects in focus. A prescribed 

number of optical images of the same scene are provided by 
recording an optical image at a respective focal distance and 

changing the focal distance for each additional optical image as 
recorded. The optical images are subjected to wavelet 

transformation to form a multi-resolution representation. The 
coefficients of the various multi-resolution representations are 

compared at the same position to detect the maximum spectral 
amplitudes. Based on the detected maximum spectral amplitudes, 

another multi-resolution representation is obtained. Then, an 
inverse wavelet transformation is performed to obtain the 

synthesized optical image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for synthesizing optical
images. More specifically, this invention concerns a method for
synthesizing multiple optical images obtained by changing the
focal distance.When a camera is used to record optical images and objects
relatively far from the camera lens are in focus, objects nearer
to the camera lens are out of focus and their recorded images are
blurred. On the other hand, when focusing on the nearer objects,
the farther objects are out of focus and their recorded images
are blurred. This problem is believed to be related to the
intrinsic characteristics of the optical system. According to a
basic optical principle, a pinhole lens has an infinite focal
depth, and all objects are in focus when their images are
recorded within the pinhole lens of a pinhole camera. However,
for the [ideal] pinhole lens, the hole is so small that not even
a single photon can pass through it, and hence no image is
formed. That is, it is merely a hypothetical lens.Due to this basic physical limitation, the lens has a finite
focal depth, and the picture of the object is taken by means of
automatic or manual focusing. However, when two objects, one
nearer the camera and the other farther away from it, are to be
photographed in the same picture, it is impossible to bring both
into focus at the same time. That is, while bringing one object
into focus, the other goes out of focus and its image becomes
blurred. This is a disadvantage.Although not a technology for forming a synthesized image, a
technology known as inverse filtering has been tested which
attempts to create a clear image from the blurred portion of a
picked-up image by means of enhancing the blurred portion.
However, since it also amplifies noise, it fails to reach the
stage of practical applications. In US 5,124,842, an apparatus is disclosed which can
reproduce an image with a large focal depth. This is
achieved by obtaining a plurality of images with different
focal lengths, obtaining the Fourier transform of each image
and weighing those Fourier transforms, summing the weighted
Fourier transforms, and creating an image by obtaining the
inverse Fourier transform of that weighted sum.An object of this invention is to provide a method for
forming a synthesized image in which multiple optical images
picked up at different focal distances are in focus in the
synthesized image.This invention provides a method for obtaining a
synthesized image while bringing objects at different
positions into focus by means of digital signal
