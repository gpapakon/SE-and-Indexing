<ABSTRACT>
A frictional electrification gun for use in 
electrostatic painting which can electrostatically charge 

powder paint to a sufficient degree without the need of an 
elongated and twisted charging portion made up of 

nonconductive resin tubes. At the inlet of the charging 
portion made up of nonconductive resin tubes (10) is provided a 

pre-charging portion for dispersing and charging powder 
paint. It has a nonconductive resin ring (33) through which 

powder paint is fed swirling along its inner surface. The 
paint is thus sufficiently charged.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spray gun using frictional
electrification for electrostatic painting in which
powder paint is electrically charged by the friction
between the paint and a nonconductive polymer when
they are brought into contact with each other.Such a frictional electrification spray gun comprises a gun
body having at one end a paint inlet and at the other end a
paint outlet, and a paint charging portion in the form of a
non-conductive resin tube provided in the gun body.In order to sufficiently charge a powder paint with
such a frictional electrification gun, the paint has to be
brought into contact with the nonconductive resin tube as
many times as possible.Thus, conventional frictional electrification guns
were rather long. In fact, they were too long to be fitted
on reciprocators and painting robots. Their application
was thus limited.In a conventional frictional electrification gun, the
nonconductive resin tube is twisted many times (50-70
times) to increase the number of times the paint is brought
into contact with the tube. Such a gun has a problem in
that the inner surface of the nonconductive resin tube
tends to be worn severely and thus the tube is likely to be 
broken soon. Another problem is that it is practically
impossible to change the color of the paint because it is
difficult to completely remove old paint sticking on the
inner surface of the twisted nonconductive resin tube by
blowing air thereinto. A spray gun as defined in the precharacterizing portion of
claim 1 has been disclosed in SU-A-1069863. The spray gun or
triboelectric atomizer disclosed therein has a precharging
portion formed as a tube through which the paint powder is
carried by an airstream in a laminar flow. In order to obtain
sufficient precharging the tube has a considerable length comparable
to the length of the charging tube. In order to reduce
the overall length of the gun the precharging is arranged in
parallel to the charging tube, which results in a twisted path
of the powder paint including two 180°-deflections, which involves
the aforementioned problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a
frictional electrification spray gun which can impart sufficient
electric charges to powder paint without the necessity of
prolonging the entire length of the gun or twisting the
nonconductive resin tube.In order to attain the above object, according to
this invention there is provided a spray
gun for use in electrostatic painting as defined
in claim 1.Since the powder paint is directed toward the
