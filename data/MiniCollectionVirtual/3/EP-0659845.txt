<ABSTRACT>
Vinylidene fluoride copolymers having a melting temperature below about 
160°C are used to prepare pigmented powder coatings for galvanised 

steel. The coatings are corrosion-resistant and generally show a high 
gloss.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluorinated powder coating 
products, and to a process for coating galvanised steel with a 
fluorinated powder coating. In particular, the present invention 
relates to the use of vinylidene fluoride copolymers in pigmented 
powder coating products, for obtaining corrosion-resistant 
PVdFC-based protective coatings on galvanised steel. Coatings based on vinylidene fluoride polymers (hereinafter 
PVdF) are known to be very useful as protective coatings for a 
variety of substrates due to the good chemical and weathering 
resistance and to the thermal stability of PVdF. The general known 
technique used for preparing them is to prepare a dispersion of 
PVdF in a suitable solvent for application by known means onto the 
required substrate which is thereafter subjected to a heat 
treatment. The solvent used is generally known in the prior art as "latent 
solvent", and it is described therein as an organic solvent which 
has no significant action on PVdF at room temperature but which at 
an elevated temperature exerts a sufficient solvent action. However, although the known systems may give good results, 
environmental protection laws throughout the world, but mainly in 
Europe and in the U.S.A., are making it increasingly difficult to 
handle solvent-based systems. Further, the recovery of the solvent 
is a costly procedure. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for 
solventless PVdF-based coatings. GB-2194539-A discloses pigmented PVdF-based powder coating 
products essentially consisting of vinylidene fluoride homopolymer 
(or copolymer with at most 10 wt% of comonomer units), one or more 
compatible thermoplastic resin and one or more pigments. It also 
discloses a process for preparing the products. However, the 
baking temperature is too high. EP-456018-A discloses pigmented powder coatings of vinylidene 
fluoride/hexafluoropropylene copolymers, the resin component 
comprising 50-90 wt% of said copolymers having a melt viscosity of 
1-4 kPoise at 100 s⁻¹ and 232°C, said copolymers being  
 
characterised by a melting point in the range of about 160°C to 
about 170°C, and 50-10 wt% of thermoplastic acrylic resin. The 
resulting coatings are said to be characterised by improved 
flexibility, crack resistance and surface smoothness (as opposed to 
surface roughness or "orange peel" associated with the finish) 
whilst not requiring the inclusion of a flow-improving agent. 
However the baking temperature is also too high for use on 
galvanised steel. Indeed, galvanised
