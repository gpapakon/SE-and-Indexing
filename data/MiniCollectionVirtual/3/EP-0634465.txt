<ABSTRACT>
Method of polishing a surface (5a) of copper or an alloy comprising 
mainly copper, in which a polishing means is moved across the surface while 
exerting a 
polishing pressure of approximately 500 g/cm² for obtaining a plane and smooth 

polished surface without any defects. A composition of a polishing component 
comprising a colloidal suspension of SiO₂ particles having an average particle size of 

between 20 and 50 nm in an alkali solution, demineralised water and a chemical 
activator is used as a polishing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of polishing a surface of copper or an
alloy comprising mainly copper, in which a polishing means and said surface are moved
with respect to each other while exerting a polishing pressure for obtaining a polished
surface.It is generally known to polish a copper surface mechanically by means
of polishing grains. Although a satisfactory planeness can generally be achieved in this
way, the polished surface has many grooves and scratches when viewed
microscopically. Moreover, mechanical polishing causes material disturbances under the
polished surface. A mechanically polished surface is unsuitable for many uses such as,
for example direct bonding or for high-grade reflectors. Moreover, in the manufacture
of layered high-tech products, such as thin-film magnetic heads, very plane and smooth
polished surfaces without defects are required.A method for polishing a metal surface, such as a surface of copper, is
described in US-A 4,959,113. This known method comprises (a) providing an aqueous
polishing composition comprising water, an abrasive agent and a salt; (b) applying the
composition to the metal surface; and (c) polishing the metal surface. The addition of
salt promotes the polishing effect of the used abrasives.It is an object of the invention to provide a method of polishing a surface
of copper or an alloy comprising mainly copper, in which a polishing means is moved
across the surface to be polished while exerting a polishing pressure, with which
method a surface which is substantially plane, smooth and without defects can be
obtained. To this end the method according to the invention is characterized in that the
polishing means comprise a composition comprising a colloidal suspension of SiO2
particles having an average particle size between 20 and 50 nm in an alkali solution and
demineralised water, and in that the polishing pressure is between 400 and 600 g/cm2
exerted by means of an absorbent polishing base, which polishing base has a hardness in
the range between Shore A hardness 40 and Shore D hardness 90, and in that the
polishing means also comprises a substance from the group formed by hydrogen
peroxide, organic peroxides and hypochlorides as a chemical activator.It has been found that the use of the method according to the invention for
copper or alloys comprising mainly copper such as brass or bronze yield substantially
plane polished surfaces without defects, with surface roughness R (rms) of less than 2
nm being achievable. It is assumed that the particles
