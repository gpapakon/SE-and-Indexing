<ABSTRACT>
Adhesion promoting additives for organosiloxane 
compositions that cure by a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilation 

reaction are reaction products of (1) an ethylenically 
unsaturated ether of a polyfunctional alcohol and (2) at 

least one silicon compound selected from (i) epoxysubstituted 
organosilicon compounds containing at least one 

hydrolyzable group per molecule and (ii) tetraalkyl orthosilicates, 
also referred to tetraalkoxysilanes, where the 

reaction is conducted in the presence of a suitable catalyst 
such as an organotitanium compound. The additive optionally 

includes a chelated organoaluminum compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organosiloxane
compositions that cure by a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilation
reaction and, more particularly, to pre-reacted combinations
of additives that improve the adhesion of organosiloxane
compositions to a variety of substrates, including metals
and plastics, at curing temperatures below 100°C.The curing characteristics of these organosiloxane
compositions and their properties as cured materials are
desirable for a variety of end use applications,
particularly in the electrical and electronics areas. The
cured materials are useful as protective coatings, potting
materials and encapsulants for integrated circuits and other
electronic devices or as coatings for printed circuit
boards.A shortcoming of such organosiloxane compositions
is their inability to adhere strongly to many substrates,
particularly plastics and certain metals. One method for
remedying this deficiency is the use of primer compositions
or adhesion promoting additives containing silanes and
organosiloxanes with a plurality of silicon-bonded
hydrolyzable groups and at least one organofunctional
substituent that is bonded to silicon through at least one
carbon atom. Primer compositions are applied to substrates
to which adhesion is desired prior to application of the
curable organosiloxane composition. Adhesion promoters are
also present in the curable organosiloxane composition.Examples of hydrolyzable groups that are present
in known adhesion-promoting organosilicon compounds are 
alkoxy, carboxy such as acetoxy, ketoximo such as methyl-ethyl
ketoximo and amido. The organofunctional group is
typically one that will react with the substrate to which
adhesion is desired. Examples of suitable organofunctional
groups include alkenyl such as vinyl and allyl, aminoalkyl,
epoxyalkyl, mercaptoalkyl and (meth)acryloxyalkyl.Three classes of silanes frequently used as
adhesion promoting additives are epoxy-functional silanes
such as 3-glycidoxypropyltrialkoxysilanes, alkenyl-functional
silanes such as vinyltrialkoxysilanes and alkyl
silicates such as tetraethyl orthosilicate. These silanes
can be at least partially replaced by their
hydrolysis/condensation products.The use of organic or organosilicon compounds
containing epoxy groups in combination with organic aluminum
or zirconium compounds as an adhesion promoter for organosiloxane
compositions that cure by a platinum catalyzed
hydrosilation reaction is known in the art. See, for
example, EP-A 0,240,333 and JP-A 1,503,369.The art also teaches using two or more
