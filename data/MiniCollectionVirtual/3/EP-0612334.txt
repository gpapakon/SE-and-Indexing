<ABSTRACT>
Highly filled, curable compositions containing a curable liquid, e.g. methyl methacrylate; 20 to 80 % by weight of a finely divided inorganic filler of defined particle size, e.g. silica; a non-functionalised polymer containing a low Tg component which is soluble in the curable liquid, e.g. a non-functionalised vinyl aromatic/conjugated diene block copolymer; and other components which disperse the filler in the curable liquid and couple the filler to the matrix can be used to produce cured composites which show improved resistance to stress induced by thermal cycling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of certain polymeric
materials as agents for improving the thermal stability of
moulded articles, to highly filled, curable compositions
containing such agents suitable for moulding shaped articles and
to the articles moulded therefrom.Composites of highly filled polymeric compositions are
becoming increasingly used as materials of construction,
particularly for kitchen sinks, kitchen surfaces and
sanitaryware, because of their attractive appearance and hard
wearing properties. Fluid, curable compositions containing high
volumes of finely divided fillers suitable for forming such
articles have been described in British Patent No. 1 493 393.
This specification describes fluid, curable compositions wherein
high volumes of filler of specified particle size are dispersed
in a curable material using polymeric dispersants. The use of
polymeric dispersants enable compositions to be obtained
containing high volumes of finely divided fillers, for example
50% by volume, which have a remarkably low viscosity enabling the
compositions to be readily handled for example by pumping. This
low viscosity, in turn, enables the compositions to be sold as
fluid dispersions which can be readily transported to fabricators
who can mould articles in inexpensive low pressure moulds.
Although some sedimentation will inevitably occur on storage, the
polymeric dispersant maintains the filler particles in a state of
stable, deflocculation so that the sediment can be readily
redispersed by mild agitation to give a dispersion in which the
filler particles are substantially uniformly dispersed and will
remain so whilst the composition is converted from a fluid
dispersion to a fully cured composite. The presence of the
polymeric dispersant, and its function of keeping the particles
in a state of stable deflocculation, not only enables a low
viscosity, redispersible dispersion to be obtained, but ensures
that compatibility of the components is maintained as the 
   composition is cured so that a cured product free from cracks and
flaws is obtained.It is also possible to fabricate moulded articles which have a viscosity
too high to be of practical value as transportable, low viscosity, redispersible
compositions. Nevertheless, these compositions are useful where the
fabrication operation is carried out at the same location as the composition is
prepared and where storage and redispersion are not a problem. These
compositions must also contain fillers which are properly dispersed within the
curable
