<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene 
resin composition for coating the exterior parts of 
automobiles which can afford an excellent coating adherence, 
a high rigidity, high impact strength at low temperatures, 
prominent heat resistance and an excellent appearance to 
moldings even without effecting a pretreatment step, i.e., 
treatment with trichloroethane before coating. Recently automotive parts have been made to have 
an increasingly thinner wall thickness as an increasingly 
larger type of automobile having a lighter weight has been 
manufactured, so that there is a need for coating materials, 
which enable coatings excellent in heat resistance, impact 
strength at low temperatures, and in appearance of moldings. There have been heretofore proposed for such 
materials numerous compositions comprising a combination of 
crystalline polypropylenes with rubber and inorganic 
fillers. However, most exterior parts of automobiles are 
likely to be attached in place after painted to have 
brilliant and high grade perception. Current techniques for 
the paintings employ the steps of treating moldings with a  
 
vapor of 1,1,1-trichloroethane normally for 30 seconds to 
degrease and etch, then undercoating with a primer, and then 
applying a polyurethane paint as overcoating. Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) No. 63-128045 
discloses an improved coating composition comprising a 
polypropylene polymer composition having an excellent 
adhesiveness with polyurethanes as overcoating even without 
using any primer. In this patent, however, a treatment with 
a vapor of 1,1,1-trichloroethane is required. The use of 1,1,1-trichloroethane was restricted 
and decided to be entirely inhibited until the end of 1995, 
together with the flon gas regulation, by the conference 
held in Montreal September, 1991. Therefore, coating 
materials for automotive parts simply having rigidity, 
strength, heat resistance and impact strength at low 
temperatures are not sufficient to cope with the regulations 
unless they allow achivement of enhanced coating adherence 
even omitting the treatment with 1,1,1-trichloroethane. 
Development of such coating materials has been vigorously 
desired. As a result of our intensive research made to 
overcome the difficulties as described above, it has been 
found that they can be overcome by using a specific 
polypropylene resin composition having specific components, 
based on which the present invention has been completed.  
 In view of the aforementioned circumstances in the 
art,
