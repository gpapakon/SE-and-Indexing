<DESCRIPTION>
 Dental FormulationArea of the Invention This invention concerns inhibiting tooth enamel demineralization. More specifically it relates to the use of a water soluble phosphate, particularly a pyrophosphate or tripolyphosphate, to inhibit demineralization while not negatively impacting remineralization. This provides a means for preventing or reducing dental caries.Much work has been done to reduce tooth decay by chemical means. Decay has a number of causes. One most commonly thought of is enamel demineralization. The most widely used approach to preventing demineralization and to remineralize enamel is to present a fluoride ion to the oral cavity via a mouthwash or other short term topical application means. Fluoridated drinking water has had a material impact in reducing dental caries. Other approaches use dentifrices, pastes applied directly to the teeth by professionals, or oral rinses which contain a fluoride ion as a means for fluoridating teeth. Dentifrices, pastes and mouthwashes contain a low level of a fluoride salt, most often as the alkali metal fluorides, alkali metal salts of monofluorophosphate and stannous fluoride. A usual, and effective, fluoride concentration in these types of products is on the order of 1100 parts per million (ppm). To date no other chemical approach has been developed as a means for inhibiting enamel demineralization and thus preventing or treating dental caries.It has been found that certain water soluble phosphates exemplified by the alkali metal pyrophosphates and tripolyphosphates inhibit demineralization of enamel and they do not interfere with the remineralization phenomena of the fluoride ion in subsurface caries-like lesions. This finding makes it possible to provide an anti-caries dental preparation which does not use fluoride. Summary of the InventionThis invention has two aspects. One is a method for reducing or preventing dental caries in humans by inhibiting enamel demineralization, which method comprises treating the teeth with a formulation containing a demineralization inhibitor consisting essentially of an effective non-toxic amount of a water soluble pyrophosphate or tripolyphosphate in an orally acceptable carrier. In the second aspect, this invention covers an orally acceptable formulation 

for preventing dental caries in humans by reducing or preventing demineralization which comprises an orally acceptable carrier and an inhibitor of enamel demineralization consisting essentially of an effective non-toxic amount of a water soluble pyrophosphate
