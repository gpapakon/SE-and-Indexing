<ABSTRACT>
In an image sensor using photodiodes, the 
structure is arranged so that a lens for each 

photodiode focuses light onto a first portion of the 
photodiode. Light from the scene directly illuminates 

a second portion of the photodiode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lens arrays 
for light sensitive devices. Image sensing devices made up of an array of 
laterally spaced sensors are well known and can take a 
variety of forms. The array can be viewed as being 
made up of a number of laterally offset regions, 
commonly referred to as pixels or sensing elements. 
The art has recognized that sensing advantages can be 
realized by forming a lens array having a convex lens 
surface for each pixel. FIG. 1 shows a single pixel 10 
on which a photodiode 12 can be seen through a light 
shield aperture 14 centrally located under a lens 16. A lens array placed in registration with the 
device serves to focus the incident light upon the 
photodiodes. This has the effect of increasing the 
light gathering area of the photodiode and hence 
improving the signal. The device has a lens supporting layer for 
offsetting the lens from the photodiode to maximize 
collection of light in the photodiode. The fabrication 
of lens arrays is based upon using conventional 
positive-working photoresists. A coating of the 
photoresist is exposed and developed to produce an 
array of resist islands. The resist pattern is then 
flood exposed to bleach the remaining photochemistry 
and subsequently heated until the resist material flows 
enough to form a lens and yet not so much as to cause 
adjacent lenses to flow together. Therefore, there has 
to be some spacing between the lenses. The function of the photodiode is well known 
and produces electrons in proportion to the amount of  
 
increased light gathering area of each pixel 
thereby increasing device signal; and improved utilization of the required space 
between adjacent lenses. FIG. 1 is a schematic plan overhead view 
showing a conventional organization of aperture in 
light shield, photodiode, and lens over a single pixel;  
 
light received on exposure. The problem with this 
arrangement is that light is focused onto a central 
region 17 of the photodiode. Since the light shield 
aperture and photodiode are elongated and the lens base 
is essentially square to match the pixel shape, the 
lens must be designed to focus the light through the 
smallest side of the light shield aperture. Therefore, 
only a portion of the photodiode is used to receive 
light. The efficiency of this type of arrangement is 
therefore not maximized. US-patent 4 667 092 discloses a solid-state image device 
corresponding to the preamble of 
claim 1. The present invention relates to an image sensor as set 
forth in claim 1. The

<CLAIMS>
An image sensor having a plurality of 
photodiodes (12) and a lens array (40) having individual lenses, each 

such lens being disposed over a particular photodiode, said 
sensor comprising: 


(a) a light shield (26) provided for each photodiode (12) 
and having an elongated aperture; and 
(b) each lens being provided over a lens region 
of the aperture to focus light from a scene on a first 

portion (48) of the photodiode and characterized in that light from 

the scene also directly illuminates a second portion (52) of the 
photodiode through a non-lens region of the aperture. 
The image sensor of claim 1 further 
including a color filter array positioned between the 

lens array and the light shield.
