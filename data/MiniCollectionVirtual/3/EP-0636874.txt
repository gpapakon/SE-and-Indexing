<ABSTRACT>
Method for metering a predetermined quantity of liquid, characterised in that: (a) at least one capillary cavity (1,11,57) is provided which opens to the outside via an orifice (2,21) which is dimensioned so that the liquid cannot spontaneously enter or leave the said cavity; (b) a bath (3,31) of the said liquid is provided; (c) the said cavity (1,11,57), initially free of any liquid, is evacuated in order to bring its internal pressure to a value which is less than that prevailing above the liquid bath (3,31) during step (d); (d) the interior of the capillary cavity (1,11,57), which is at least partially evacuated, is connected via the introduction orifice (2,21) with the liquid bath (3,31), by means of which the said cavity is filled; (e) the filled capillary cavity (1,11,57) is separated from the rest of the liquid bath (3,31); (f) the filled capillary cavity (1,11,57) separated from the liquid bath (3,31) is emptied via the introduction orifice (2,21).

Process for metering a predetermined quantity of 
a liquid, characterized in that: 


(a) at least one capillary cavity (1, 11, 57) is provided 
which is capable of containing said liquid, the 

outwardly emerging orifice (2, 21) of which is used 
both for introducing and emptying said liquid, and 

is dimensioned such that the liquid cannot enter or 
leave said cavity spontaneously in particular with 

cross section less than that of the capillary 
cavity; 
(b) a bath (3, 31) of said liquid is provided; 
(c) said cavity (1, 11, 57), initially free of any 
liquid, is evacuated at least partially in order to 

bring its residual internal pressure to a value 
which is less than that prevailing above the liquid 

bath (3, 31) during step (d), especially atmospheric 
pressure; 
(d) the interior of the capillary cavity (1, 11, 57), 
which is at least partially evacuated, is connected 

via the orifice (2, 21) to the liquid bath (3, 31), 
which is, in particular, under atmospheric pressure, 

by means of which said cavity is filled; 
(e) the filled capillary cavity (1, 11, 57) is separated 
from the rest of the liquid bath (3, 31); 
(f) the capillary cavity (1, 11, 57) which is filled and 
separated from the liquid bath (3, 31) is emptied. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that step (c) is carried out by arranging said cavity (1, 

11, 57) in the liquid bath (3, 31) and by applying above 
the latter a pressure less than that prevailing above the 

liquid bath (3, 31) during step (d). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that step (f) is carried out according to any one of the 

modes defined hereinbelow, namely: 

3.1) application of a centrifugal force passing 
through the introduction orifice (2); 
3.2) application, outside the cavity (1, 11), of an 
external pressure less than its internal  

 
pressure; 
3.3) application, inside the cavity (1, 11), of a 
pressure greater than its internal pressure; 
3.4) the liquid volume filling the cavity (1, 11) is 
pushed out of the latter. 
Process according to Claim 3, according to which 
step (f) is carried out by mode 3.2, characterized in 

that the cavity (1, 11, 57) is arranged in another liquid 
bath (4) and a pressure less than the internal pressure 

of the cavity (1, 11, 57) is applied above said bath. 
Method of controlled dilution of a liquid, 
implementing a metering process according to any one of 

Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, on the one hand, 
the liquid (1, 11, 57) to be diluted constitutes the 

liquid bath according to steps (a) to (e) and, on the 
other hand, according to step (f), the filled cavity (31) 

is emptied into a metered quantity of a liquid diluent 
(4). 
Method of dilution according to Claims 1, 4 and 
5, characterized in that the metered quantity of the 

liquid diluent (4) constitutes said other liquid bath 
according to step (f) of the metering process.
