<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adhesive compositions 
comprising a phosphorylated compound. In another 
aspect, this invention relates to adhesive compositions 
comprising a carboxylic acid functional polymer. Dental amalgams and restorative composites are 
used extensively for intracoronal and extracoronal 
restorations. Amalgam, however, does not adhere to 
tooth structure and the dentist must prepare the tooth 
cavity with dovetails and various cutout grooves that 
mechanically lock the amalgam into the cavity. Such 
preparation, however, results in excavation of more 
tooth structure than would otherwise be necessary if 
there was good adhesion between the tooth structure and 
the amalgam. Moreover, leakage at the interface of the 
amalgam and cavity wall (known as "microleakage") tends 
to occur. This microleakage allows penetration of 
bacteria, soluble salts, and saliva into any space 
between the amalgam and tooth structure. This can lead 
to inflammation, pulp irritation, demineralization of 
the tooth, corrosion of the amalgam, and other 
attendant complications. An adhesive seal between 
amalgam and tooth structure could minimize and/or 
prevent microleakage and allow for a stronger 
restoration due to excavation of less tooth material. Products claiming to make amalgam adhesive to 
tooth structure are available. One such product is  
 
sold in a kit under the trademark AMALGAMBOND™ (Parkell 
Co.). This product is a liquid adhesive to be coated 
directly onto tooth structure. The active ingredients 
in the adhesive include 4-META (4-methacryloxyethyl 
trimellitic anhydride) and TBB (tri-n butyl borane). 
Other products which similarly involve coating a 
specific curable resin directly onto tooth structure to 
make amalgam adhere are available under the trademarks 
PANAVIA™ Dental Adhesive (Kuraray Company) and 
SUPERBOND™ Adhesive (Sun Medical Co., Ltd., Kyoto, 
Japan). These latter products also are difficult to 
employ, since there are a number of required 
preparatory steps for their application and curing. Adhesive compositions that employ phosphorus-containing 
free-radically polymerizable compounds have 
been reported in the literature, see, e.g., M. 
Buonocore, W. Wileman, and F. Brudevold, J. Dent. Res., 
35, 846 (1956), M. Buonocore and M. Quigley, J. Amer. 
Dent. Assoc., 57, 807 (1958), M. Anbar and E. Farley, 
J. Dent. Res., 53, 879 (1974), E. Farley, R. Jones, and 
M. Anbar, J. Dent. Res., 56, 1943 (1977), U.S. Pat Nos.

<CLAIMS>
An adhesive composition, comprising: 

(i) an ethylenically unsaturated phosphorylated 
compound; 
(ii) a carboxylic acid functional polymer in an 
amount effective to increase adhesion of amalgam to 

tooth structure when the composition is used as an 
intermediate layer between the amalgam and the tooth 

structure, compared to the adhesion obtained using a 
like composition absent the carboxylic acid functional 

polymer; and 
(iii) a curing agent in an amount sufficient to 
effect cure of the composition. 
A composition according to Claim 1, wherein 
the ethylenically unsaturated phosphorylated compound 

comprises a chlorophosphorus acid ester of Bis-GMA. 
A composition according to Claim 1, wherein 
the carboxylic acid functional polymer is a 

methacrylate-functional copolymer of itaconic acid and 
acrylic acid. 
A composition according to Claim 1, further 
comprising a particulate metallic filler in an amount 

effective to increase adhesion of amalgam to tooth 
structure when the composition is used as an 

intermediate layer between the amalgam and the tooth 
structure, compared to the adhesion obtained using a 

like composition absent the particulate metallic 
filler. 
A composition according to Claim 4, wherein 
the ethylenically unsaturated phosphorylated compound 

comprises a chlorophosphorus acid ester of Bis-GMA.  
 
A composition according to Claim 4, wherein 
the carboxylic acid functional polymer is a 

methacrylate-functional copolymer of itaconic acid and 
acrylic acid.
