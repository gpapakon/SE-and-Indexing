<ABSTRACT>
A plasma generating method and apparatus fit for generating a plasma 
by means of microwaves. 
A microwave penetrating window and a cavity which are substantially 
equal in diameter to a plasma generating chamber are successively 

connected to the plasma generating chamber and microwaves are introduced 
via the cavity into the plasma generating chamber. A processing 

gas in the plasma generating chamber is converted into a plasma by 
means of the microwaves introduced into the plasma generating chamber 

and the microwaves in specific modes are resonated in between a 
microwave reflective interface with the plasma generated in the plasma 

generating chamber and the reflective edge face of the cavity. The 
microwaves in the specific modes are thus formed in the cavity and the 

energy of the microwaves in the specific modes is increased by resonance. 
The boosted energy is added to the plasma and the plasma is densified 

accordingly. Moreover, a plasma excellent in uniformity and stability can 
be generated by resonating the microwaves in the specific modes in the 

presence of a uniform electromagnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plasma generating methods and
apparatus, and plasma processing methods and apparatus using the same.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a plasma generating
method and apparatus for use in generating a plasma by means of
microwaves, and a plasma processing method and apparatus which uses
the same and is used in processing specimens (for example,
semiconductor elements by means of the plasma).The generating of a plasma and processing specimens by means of the
plasma has been mentioned in, for example, "Microwave Plasma Etching
Apparatus," by Kanai et al., pp 23 âˆ¼ 28, No. 9, Vol. 73, Hitachi Review
(1991). Fig. 16 shows such an apparatus as noted above in which a
quartz bell-jar 24 as a semispheric quartz discharge tube is installed in
a waveguide 22 for propagating microwaves and a plasma is generated
in the quartz bell-jar 24 through the interaction between the external
magnetic field of solenoid coils 23 and the electric field of the
microwaves from a magnetron 21. The plasma thus generated is utilized
to process a wafer 5 as a workpiece loaded on a specimen stage 26 in
a processing chamber. In this case, reference numeral 27 denotes a
radio-frequency power source for applying an RF bias voltage to the 
specimen stage 26 at the time of etching; an etching gas 28 to be
introduced into the quartz bell-jar 24; and an exhaust gas 29.Such specimen processing devices generate non-uniform and unstable
plasma which limit the narrowness of lines which can be etched. For
example, in the process of manufacturing semiconductors using a plasma,
the specimen loaded on a specimen stage needs processing uniformly
without being electrically damaged. However, the aforementioned prior
art has been unsatisfactory to gain plasma performance corresponding to
a future demand for diameter-enlargement and densification, that is, to
gain a high-density uniform plasma.The prior art microwave plasma etching apparatus has been so
constructed as to generate the plasma in the semispheric quartz bell-jar
installed as a microwave penetrating member in the waveguide. For this
reason, the tendency is for the microwaves propagated in the waveguide
to be easily affected by the quartz bell-jar. As microwaves in a plurality
of modes can be present in a large-diameter waveguide, they are caused
by the semispheric quartz bell-jar and the plasma generated therein to
repeat complicated reflection and refraction in the waveguide before
being absorbed by the plasma in the quartz bell-jar. As a
