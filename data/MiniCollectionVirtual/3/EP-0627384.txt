<ABSTRACT>
A potassium chloride mixture having particles of different size is, in a first step, leached with an unsaturated solution at elevated temperature, with the very fine components being completely dissolved and the coarse components being partially dissolved, the purified middle fraction (10) is transported to a second process step and there the amount of KCl previously dissolved is crystallised onto the purified particles at a lower temperature, and a product of high purity evened out over its particle size and having a narrow particle size distribution is thus formed.

A method of treating a mixture of potassium chloride with 
grains of different sizes, in particular with grains of a diameter of up 

to 1.5 mm, in which the dry or moist potassium chloride is made into a 
mash with a potassium chloride solution and fed in a continuous circuit 

to a dissolving vessel, characterised in that 

a) the potassium chloride is kept in suspension in the dissolving 
vessel by a circulatory flow and at the same time subjected to a grading 

procedure, wherein 
b) a certain temperature is maintained in the dissolving vessel 
and the potassium chloride solution is in the unsaturated condition and 

wherein 
c) the finer grains are completely dissolved and the coarser 
grains are retained in the dissolving vessel until - as a result of the 

dissolving procedure - a mean grain size is reached, and the grains with 
a mean size are removed in opposite relationship to the circulatory flow 

through an inner pipe in the dissolving vessel and wherein 
d) the removed KCl-crystals together with a given variable amount 
of potassium chloride solution from the dissolving vessel are fed to a 

crystalliser in which a condition of supersaturation is maintained by the 
removal of heat and in which the KCl-crystals are held in suspension by a 

circulatory flow, wherein 
e) with increasing KCl-crystal size the crystals sink down, 
whereafter the KCl-crystals which have sunk down are removed by way of a 

centrally arranged removal pipe in the crystalliser and as a salt slurry 
subjected to a separation procedure in per se known manner. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that associated 
with the dissolving vessel (3) is a solution circuit (8) in which a heat 

exchanger (8b) is incorporated, water being fed to said circuit (8).  
 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that associated 
with the crystalliser (4) is a solution circuit (1) in which a heat 

exchanger (11a) is arranged. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
temperature in the dissolving vessel (3) is between 30°C and 90°C, 

preferably between 50°C and 70°C. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
temperature in the crystalliser (4) is lower by 10°C to 40°C than in the 

dissolving vessel (3). 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the sodium 
chloride content in the unsaturated solution is kept below 100 g/l, 

preferably below 70 g/l. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim 1 
characterised in that a conical dissolving vessel (3) with a central 

inner pipe (7) which by fitments can be immersed to different depths in 
the solids bed, and by an associated circuit (8) for removal of the 

solution from the dissolving vessel (3) and a heat exchanger (8b) which 
is arranged therein and which is in communication with the mash feed line 

(1a) to the dissolving vessel (3), and by a crystalliser (4) which is 
connected with a line (11) to the inner pipe (7) of the dissolving vessel 

(3) for the purposes of transfer of solution and solid material from the 
dissolving vessel (3) and to a line (4c) for the purposes of returning 

the solution into the dissolving vessel (3). 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim 1 
characterised in that the central inner pipe (7) opens directly into the 

crystalliser (4).
