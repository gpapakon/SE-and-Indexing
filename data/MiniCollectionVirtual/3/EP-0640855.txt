<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
adjusting an alignment of optical fibers constituting
optical fiber ribbons, which is useful in the fusion
splicing of the optical fibers for example.Conventionally, in the collective fusion splicing of
the optical fibers constituting the optical fiber ribbon,
the alignment of the core axes of the optical fibers to be
fusion spliced has been achieved by mounting the optical
fibers to be fusion spliced on V-grooves for fixedly
mounting the optical fibers which are precisely machined
along a straight line so as to be able to align the
cladding axes of the optical fibers to be fusion spliced,
and then by utilizing the self-alignment effect of the
optical fibers due to the surface tension exerted on the
optical fibers during the discharge heating process.However, this surface tension is not quite sufficient
to reduce the connection loss significantly, and there
still remains a need for adjusting the alignment of each
optical fiber.For this purpose, there has been an apparatus for
adjusting the alignment of each optical fiber in the
optical fiber ribbon individually, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid Open No. 5-273430 (1993) which has
a configuration as shown in Fig. 1.In this apparatus of Fig. 1, for each optical fiber
101, there is provided a pair of movable members 102A and
102B having approximately 45° inclined end faces to form a 
V-groove for mounting each optical fiber 101, each of which
is supported by a stationary fixed guide member 100 to be
minutely movable up or down, and moved up or down by a
stack type piezoelectric element. The position of the
optical fiber 101 is adjusted in a desired direction by the
appropriate combination of the up and down minute movements
of these movable members 102A and 102B so as to adjust the
alignment of the optical fibers.In this conventional apparatus of Fig. 1, in a case of
dealing with the SM (single-mode) type optical fiber which
has an outer diameter equal to 125 µm, considering the
thickness of a part of the guide member 100 to be provided
between the pair of the movable members 102A and 102B, it
is necessary for each of the movable members 102A and 102B
to have a thickness not greater than 100 µm, but in
practice, it is quite difficult to improve the
manufacturing precision for the thickness in an order of
tens of µm, and the movable member can be damaged very
easily. In addition, such thin movable members can be bent
very easily, so that the operation to assemble these
movable members into a
