<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
determining the sound transfer characteristic of an
active noise control system usable with various
electronic equipment such as computers.A conventional active noise control system is
installed for, for example, a computer room. The
computers in the computer room accommodate computer
circuit boards that generate heat. The circuit boards
are cooled by cooling fans. The exhaust from the fans is
guided through a duct. The moving air, the cooling fans,
etc., cause noise. To detect and cancel the noise, the
active noise control system has a noise-detection
microphone, a speaker for generating noise-cancelling
sound, an error detecting microphone for detecting a
cancellation error, and an adaptive filter whose
parameters are controlled to minimize the output of the
error detecting microphone. The sound from the speaker
is propagated towards a noise-source and enters the noise
detection microphone, to cause feedback sound signal. It
is necessary, therefore, to provide an active noise
control system that is capable of preventing such
feedback.The active noise control system having a
prevention function must determine the sound-transfer
characteristic in the system, to deal with the sound
propagating in the exhaust duct. Since the sound
transfer characteristic is dependent on the length of the
duct and the operating conditions of the system, it is
very difficult to correctly determine the sound transfer 
characteristic even using a plurality of microphones arranged in the duct, transfer
characteristics estimating algorithms, or FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analyzer.
Namely, there are no conventional methods for correctly determining the sound-transfer
characteristic in the active noise-control system.Document US-4736431 discloses an active noise reduction system having
an automatic self-calibration function. There is provided an acoustic modeling
system based on an adaptative filter in the feedback path between the error detection
microphone and the noise cancellation speaker.The object of the present invention is to provide a method of determining
the sound-transfer characteristic in an active noise-control system having a feedback
sound prevention function. The method is capable of correctly calculating the sound-transfer
characteristic of a one-dimensional sound field that is defined by a linear
ventilating system in which sound travels essentially parallel to the extended
direction of the system, for example, an inside path of a duct in an active noise-control
sys
