<ABSTRACT>
The process is characterised in that it consists in producing a mixture of two components, namely a foaming resin comprising sodium bicarbonate as cell-forming agent and a catalyst containing especially sulphonic acids, in order to produce, even at low temperature, a virtually instantaneous conversion into foam with a very fast inflation, without the need to install a contiguous and leakproof shuttering.

Process for producing barriers, for filling cavities and for sealing,by spraying, with self-foaming
phenolic resins, in particular in the mining field, involving mixing two components,

namely a foaming resin comprising sodium bicarbonate as blowing agent and a catalyst
containing, in particular, sulphonic acids, characterised in that it employs a mixture having the

following composition:

resin component:

resol
up to 80%
water
0% to 10%
sodium bicarbonate
5% to 15%
thixotropic agent (silica)
0.5% to 3%
mineral fillers
0% to 10%
catalyst component:

phenolsuphonic acid
40% to 60%
toluenesulphonic acid
10% to 20%
benzenesulphonic acid
0% to 10%
xylenesulphonic acid
0% to 10%
sulphuric acid
10% to 25%
water
10% to 20%

in order to bring about almost instantaneous transformation into foam even at low temperature
with very rapid swelling without necessitating the positioning of contiguous sealed formwork,

the sodium bicarbonate having the following grain-size distribution:

particles with a diameter of between 0.0 mm and 0.40 mm
40% to 60%
particles with a diameter of between 0.041 mm and 0.100 mm
60% to 40%.
Foaming mixture containing two components for carrying out the process according to
claim 1, characterised in that it is a bi-component of which the portions have a shelf life greater

than several months and it consists of a resin component comprising a resol, water, sodium
bicarbonate, a thixotropic agent and mineral fillers and of a catalyst component comprising

phenolsulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, xylenesulphonic acid,
sulphuric acid and water.
