<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for obtaining accurate timing 
information from a received signal, first, obtains an 

impulse response at a certain phase, which phase is 
determined based on a reference phase of a receiver 

clock, and then the obtained impulse response is 
compared with a reference level. As the reference 

level: a predetermined value just below the maximum 
value of the overall impulse response; an impulse 

response at another phase; or an impulse response at 
the same phase in a previous period, is used. The 

reference phase is controlled, according to the result 
of the comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for 
obtaining accurate timing information from a received 
signal. In synchronous digital data receivers, the 
receiver clock must be continuously synchronized in 
frequency and phase with the received data signal to 
optimize the sampling timing of the received data 
signal and to compensate for frequency drift between 
the transmitter of the data signal and the receiver 
clock. For that purpose, generally, timing information is 
extracted from a received data signal in synchronous 
digital data receivers. Figure 1 shows a part of a conventional 
construction for extracting timing information from a 
received data signal. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 11 denotes a line 
equalizer, 12 denotes a level shift circuit, 13 denotes 
a tank circuit, 14 denotes a limiter circuit, 15 
denotes a rectifier circuit, and 16 denotes a pulse 
generator. The line equalizer 11 equalizes, i.e., compensates 
for a distortion of a wave shape of the received data 
signal that is induced by the characteristics of a 
transmission line through which the the data signal has 
been transmitted from a transmitter. The equalized data signal is level-shifted by the 
level shift circuit 12, and is then input into the tank 
circuit 13. The tank circuit 13, which is a pass-band circuit  
 
consisting of an L-C resonance circuit, extracts a band 
of frequency components including a predetermined clock 
frequency of the communication system at the center, 
from the output of the rectifier 12. The output of the tank circuit 13 is input into 
the limiter circuit 14, and is then transformed into a 
rectangular shape, i.e., to a digital bipolar signal. 
The digital bipolar signal is rectified in the 
rectifier 15, and is then input into the pulse generator, 
which is realized by a phase-lock loop (PLL) circuit 15, 
as a reference timing signal. Figure 2 shows the construction of a conventional 
digital phase-lock loop (DPLL) circuit, as an example of 
PLL circuit 15 used in the construction of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, reference numeral 20 denotes a master 
oscillator, 21 denotes a 1/2 frequency divider, 22 
denotes a selector, 23 denotes a 1/N frequency divider, 
24 denotes a phase comparator, and 25 denotes a jitter 
protection circuit. A master oscillator 20 generates a master clock, 
and the master clock is frequency-divided in the 1/2 
frequency-divider 21. The 1/2 frequency-divider 21 
outputs two types of frequency-divided timing signals, 
a 0-phase signal and a Ï€ -phase signal, where the
