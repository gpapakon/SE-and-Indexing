<ABSTRACT>
A unique class of chemiluminescent labels containing biotin substitution that are suitable for chemiluminescent assays using (inter alia) a streptavidin and/or avidin conjugate. The chemiluminescent labels of the invention have the ability to bind to streptavidin and/or avidin (per se) or to streptavidin and/or avidin conjugated with an analyte. Label structures are disclosed that have hydrolytic stability to meet the most demanding commercial assay conditions. The invention encompasses conjugates containing associated versions of the labeling compounds, assays and kits for performing such assay utilizing the conjugates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unique
chemiluminescent label containing biotin substitution
that is suitable for chemiluminescent assays using inter
alia a streptavidin and/or avidin conjugate. The
chemiluminescent label of the invention has the ability
to bind to streptavidin and/or avidin per se or to
streptavidin and/or avidin conjugated with an analyte.
The label structure disclosed has hydrolytic
stability to meet the most demanding commercial assay
conditions. The invention encompasses conjugates containing
associated versions of the labeling compound,
assays and kits for performing such assay utilizing the
conjugates. The literature describes classes of compounds that
give off light or "luminesce" by reaction through
chemical treatment, e.g., with peroxide or molecular
oxygen at high pH. The compounds that have this capability
are termed chemiluminescent materials. Light is
produced by the decay of the transient ("intermediate")
structure formed by peroxide or molecular oxygen induced
reaction at an sp2 or sp3 hybridized carbon in
the compound that is part of a chain or a ring or ring
system.As the literature indicates, any series of reactions
which produce the intermediate:

will lead to moderate to strong
chemiluminescence.  is a structure such
that the product carbonyl derivative

is fluorescent and X is a good
leaving group, usually with XH, for efficient
chemiluminescence, having a pKa of about â‰¤11,
preferably <11, and most preferably, from about 5 to
about 8. The reaction may require base catalysis. The
intermediate can be prepared (in isolable or transient
form, depending
on ) from species
such as:

and H2O2 (Y is halogen, -SO2R, and the
like) or

and base/O2.

such hybridized carbon, termed a labeling compound,
react according to the following general reaction:

where A is an aryl ring or ring system and B is a heterocyclic
ring or ring system. In this reaction, -O-A,
the leaving group, is cleaved by perhydrolysis resulting
in steps leading to the transient intermediate,
B=O, that proceeds to decay generating luminescence.The characteristics of some of these chemiluminescent
compounds, their
