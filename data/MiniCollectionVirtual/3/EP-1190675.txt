<ABSTRACT>
Method for positioning an element onto a part of the body in which the position of a device for making or preparing the connection between the body part and the element is measured relative to the body position. The method involves measurement of the spatial extent of the body and its use in a data model that is then used to provide a design position to which the replacement part is positioned relative to the body. Independent claims are made for a computer program product and a system for use with the method in preparing for and positioning a replacement body part. System includes optical, acoustic or radio-wave position determination devices, and drilling, sawing or nailing devices.

A system for applying a guiding element for an incision device to a body, comprising: 

a) a guiding element for an incision device; 
b) a drill; 
c) a position detecting device for detecting the position of said drill and for detecting the 
position of said body; 
d) a memory for storing a three-dimensional data model of an implant; and 
e) a computational unit for preparing and performing a method for preparing to and/or 
for applying said guiding element for an incision device to the body, wherein the 

position of the drill with respect to the position of the body is detected by said 
computational unit and the drill is navigated by the computational unit such that 

connecting points can be produced such that the guiding element for an incision 
device, applied to the connecting points thus produced, is in a desired position 

determined from a virtual position of an implant. 
The system as set forth in the two preceding claim, wherein said position detecting 
device detects optical, acoustic and/or radio signals. 
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding two claims, wherein one or more 
markers are applied to said guiding element for an incision device and/or said body. 
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding three claims, wherein a display 
device is provided, connected to said computational unit. 
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding four claims, wherein an input 
device is provided, connected to said computational unit.  

 
The system as set forth in any one of the preceding five claims, wherein a data 
recording device is provided which can record data during the operation of said 

system.
