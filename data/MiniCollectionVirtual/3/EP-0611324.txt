<ABSTRACT>
A rotating disc filter (10) has a plurality of sectors (20) removably mounted on drainage and support structures (14) which are fixed on a rotating hub (16). The drainage and support structure (14) has flow channels (36) and internal baffles (52, 54) which serve to trap filtrate to keep filtrate from re-wetting filter cake built up on the sectors (20) prior to removal of the filter cake from the sectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc filter for removing
filtrate from a slurry and more particularly to a modular
filter disc in which individual sectors, to create a disc,
are removably mounted on towers which support, and may also
drain, the sectors as they are rotated into and out of a
slurry.The prior art is replete with disc filters utilised to
filter slurries such as might exist, for example, in the
paper and pulp industries. Typically, and especially in
larger sizes, the discs are comprised of adjacent sectors
mounted on a rotating shaft so that successive sectors of
the disc are rotated into and subsequently out of the
slurry. During the immersion of each sector in the slurry,
a pressure differential is applied to the sector causing
the liquid in the slurry to flow through flow channels in
each sector toward a central core, or drainage, channel
while a filter cake adheres to and builds up on the outside
surface of each sector.As an example, a rotary disc filter is known from
US-A 3 291 312 which comprises a sector assembly with a
framework means for mounting individual sectors directly on
a filter shaft.Upon emergence of a sector from the slurry, a filter cake
has built up on each sector and this cake is removed, first
by ceasing application of the differential pressure and
then, subsequently, by the application of a knock-off
shower designed to peel away the substantially dry cake
which has adhered to the sector. This cake is then
collected prior to the re-entry of a sector into the slurry
to begin another cycle. Demands for increased filtration capacities have led to
ever increasing filter sizes, with some commercial
applications now ranging to 18 feet (5.49 m) or more in
diameter. When, as is inevitable, maintenance requires the
repair or replacement of sectors, the sector structure has
to be dismantled from the hub on which the sector is
mounted. Not only is the removal process awkward because
a worker has to get into the crowded space around a hub to
dismantle a sector, but sector size and weight dictate
possibly two or more workers to manage the removal
operation.Once the filter cake has built-up on a sector and the
pressure differential has been removed prior to the filter
cake removal from the surface of a sector, re-wetting of
the essentially dry filter cake by filtrate -
insufficiently drained from the sector structure -
dribbling in reverse flow, so to speak, may occur.Accordingly, it would be advantageous to create a modular
assembly so that certain parts of what would be a normal
sector

<CLAIMS>
A disc filter (10) for removing filtrate from a
slurry, said disc filter having a plurality of axially

spaced discs, each disc having a plurality of sectors (20),
wherein each sector comprises first and second surfaces

(20a, 20b) having formed thereon a plurality of surface
collection channels (36) for collecting filtrate, the first

and second surfaces being covered with a screen cloth (42);
and a hollow bore (40) formed in each

sector, the hollow
bore being in flow communication with the surface

collection channels, and a structural support (14)
radiating outwardly from a rotatable hub (16) of

said disc filter securing respective sectors to said
rotatable hub in a spaced relationship with respect to

adjacent discs and for providing radially outboard
installation and removal capability for each sector;

characterised in that each structural support is hollow and
fits within said hollow bore (40) in each of said sectors

and is in flow communication with the hollow bore (40) and
the rotatable hub (16) for conducting filtrate from said

sectors to core drainage channels (18) in said rotatable
hub.
A disc filter according to claim 1, wherein said
hollow structural support includes baffle means (52) within

the hollow interior along part of the length of the support
means for reducing drainback of filtrate and rewetting of

a filter cake formed in use on the disc sector, the baffle

means extending from the base of the support. 
A disc filter according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
sector (20) is formed from a solid polymer surrounding the

hollow bore (40).
A disc filter according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
sector is formed from a corrosion resistant metal alloy.
A disc filter according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein

the sectors (20) are secured to the hollow structural supports
(14) by nuts (30) attached to bolts (32) at the outer ends of the

hollow structural supports (14).
A disc filter according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein each said hollow bore (40) is formed in

each said sector along a radial centreline of said sector.
