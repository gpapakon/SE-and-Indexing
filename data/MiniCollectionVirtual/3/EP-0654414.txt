<ABSTRACT>
A light weight handle assembly (10) for a heavy duty container which 
may contain sensitive electronic components generally comprises a 

stationery bracket (12) which mounts to a container wall (14) and a movable 
handle (16) pivotally connected to the bracket (12). The handle (16) is 

pivotal to a disengaged position (Figure 7) allowing the handle (16) to be 
assembled to and disassembled from the bracket (12) when the bracket (12) 

is not attached to the wall (14) and is prevented from pivoting to the 
disengaged position when the bracket (12) is attached to the wall (14). The 

bracket (12) and handle (14) are formed with respective stop members 
(18,20;22,24) that engage in an operative position (Figure 6) of the handle 

and have substantially planar contact surfaces (70;72) which increase the 
effective contact area and reduce the compressive stress in the stop 

members (18,20;22,24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to handles and more
particularly to lightweight handles for lifting and transporting heavy-duty
containers.The use of handles for lifting and transporting various objects is well
known. For certain applications, it is desirable to use a handle that is light
in weight, yet provides a stable and durable mechanism for lifting heavy
objects. This is particularly true in the case of roto-moulded plastic
containers which are designed for the transport and handling of instruments
and electronic equipment in hazardous environments such as those typically
found in military, geophysical and news service applications.In the above application, the weight and size of loaded containers
necessitate that two or more handles be distributed about the outside of the
containers. Said handles are normally required to lie flat against the sides
of the containers when not in use. When the container is being carried by
the handles, however, the handles are required to stop with their bales
perpendicular to the container wall so that the fingers of people lifting the
container are not compressed between the handles bales and the walls of the
container. Such a handle needs to be capable of lifting heavy-duty
containers in the normal upward direction while experiencing heavy side
loads and outwards pulls. It is also desirable that the handle be capable of
quick assembly during commercial production and/or disassembly to replace
parts at the customer's site.A handle developed by the applicants of the present invention is
shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,012,553. Handles of this type, although
providing the required strength with less weight than prior conventional
handles, are not without their drawbacks. First, the metal bale requires
precise bending in two directions and must be heat-treated. For strength
and economy, high carbon steel is used which must be plated. Finally, as
many as twelve parts must be assembled to make the final handle. Although
the performance of such handles is good and achieved at low weight, the
cost of manufacture is relatively high.A handle assembly is disclosed in FR-A-2249632 comprising a bracket
and a handle coupled to the bracket for pivotal movement from a first
position to a second position in which the handle is located at about 90
degrees with respect to a mounting surface for the bracket by engagement 
with a pair of stop faces disposed on the bracket at 90 degrees to the
mounting surface.Another handle assembly is disclosed in JP-A-3022592 comprising a
bracket

<CLAIMS>
A handle assembly for lifting and transporting a container having a
container wall, the handle assembly comprising a stationary bracket

member (12) mountable to the container wall (14) and a movable handle
member (16) connectable to an inner portion (40;42) of the bracket

member (12), the handle member (16) having a hand grip portion (26) and
first and second arms (28;30) extending from the hand grip portion (26),

each of the first and second arms (28;30) including a pivot portion (32;34)
extending substantially parallel to the hand grip portion (26) and a stop

member (22;24) having a substantially planar contact surface (72), each of
the pivot portions (32;34) being rotatable within said inner portion (40;42) of

the bracket member (12) so that, when the bracket member (12) is attached
to the container wall (14), the handle member (16) may be pivoted between

a first position (Figure 5) and a second position (Figure 6) in which the
planar contact surfaces (72) of the stop members (22;24) come into contact

with substantially planar contact surfaces (70) of stop members (18;20) on
the bracket member (12) 
characterised in that
, when the bracket member (12) is attached
to the container wall (14), the planar contact

surfaces (70;72) of the stop members (18;20;22;24) are disposed at an angle
of about 45 degrees with respect to the container wall (14) when in contact

with one another whereby the handle member (16) is positioned at
approximately 90 degrees with respect to the container wall (14) in the

second position (Figure 6).
A handle assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that the
inner portion (40;42) of the bracket member (12) includes first and second

retainer members (48) for retaining the pivot portions (32;34) of the first and
second arms (28;30).
A handle assembly according to Claim 1 characterised in that each of
