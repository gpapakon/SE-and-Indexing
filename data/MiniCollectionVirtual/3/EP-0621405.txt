<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a fuel 
injection control apparatus for internal combustion engines, 
and more particularly to a fuel injection apparatus equipped 
with a pressure regulator in or in the vicinity of a fuel tank. Generally, an internal combustion engine equipped 
with an electronic fuel injection control apparatus includes 
a pressure regulator in or in the vicinity of an engine room, 
which utilizes the intake negative pressure as a control 
parameter for the fuel injection. This pressure regulator 
returns a part of the fuel to the fuel tank through a return 
pipe when the pressure of the fuel supplied from a 
fuel pump to a fuel injection valve rises higher than the 
pressure of an intake pipe, whereby the differential pressure 
between the intake negative pressure and the fuel pressure is 
maintained at a constant value (as disclosed in the Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 64-32066, etc.), However, according to the pressure regulator as the 
above, the return pipe for returning a part of the fuel to the 
fuel tank should be extended from the engine room generally 
provided in the front position of a vehicle to the fuel tank 
provided in the rear position of the vehicle. Therefore, the 
mounting efficiency of the pressure regulator is not  
 
sufficient. For simplifying such a return pipe, a system that the 
pressure regulator is provided in or in the vicinity of the 
fuel tank is conceived. An object of such system is to 
eliminate an intake negative pressure introduction pipe, which 
extends from the pressure regulator to an intake manifold such 
as a surge tank for suppressing the pulsation in the intake 
manifold, by maintaining the differential pressure between the 
pressure around the pressure regulator and the fuel pressure 
instead of maintaining the differential pressure between the 
intake pressure and the fuel pressure at a constant value. A problem with the above system is that, as the 
pressure of the fuel to be supplied to an injection valve is 
maintained to be constant in proportion to the pressure in or 
in the vicinity of the fuel tank, when the intake pressure 
varies, the fuel injection quantity varies, despite the open 
operation time of the injection valve remains unchanged.  
 Furthermore, document GB-2 155 994 discloses an electroniclly 
controlled fuel injection responsive to exhaust gas pressure, 
wherein a fuel injection pump provides pressurized fuel from a 
fuel tank to fuel injectors of the internal combustion engine. A
