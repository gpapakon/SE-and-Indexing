<ABSTRACT>
1. The invention relates to a process and an arrangement for digital recording and reproducing apparatuses, having a digital signal input for the recording or converting of digital signals having different sampling frequencies. 2.1 The object of the invention is to provide a process and an arrangement for digital recording and reproducing apparatuses with a digital signal input for the recording or converting of digital signals having different sampling frequencies which can be realised with little outlay. 2.2 According to the invention, this object is achieved by using an A/D converter (5), present in a digital recording and reproducing apparatus, for recording analog signals and a D/A converter (9), present for information reproduction, also for the sampling frequency conversion of a digital signal at the digital signal input (1). 2.3 The field of application concerns digital recording and reproducing apparatuses with a digital signal input (1) for the recording or converting of digital signals having different sampling frequencies on an information carrier (7), which may be an optical disc, an information carrier in tape form or the carrier frequency of a transmitter.

Apparatus for the recording (6, 7) and
reproduction (7, 8) of digital signals at a first

sampling frequency (f
2
), containing:

a digital signal input (1) for digital signals at the
first (f
2
) or a second, different sampling frequency
(f
1
, f
3
), which input, in the case of digital signals at
the first sampling frequency, makes the said signals

available for recording (6, 7);
an analogue signal input (2), downstream of which an
A/D converter (5) is arranged which operates at the

first sampling frequency (f
2
) and makes analogue input
signals available for recording (6, 7);
a D/A converter (9), which is arranged upstream of an
output (10) of the apparatus and to which, in the case

of digital signals at the second sampling frequency (f
1
,
f
3
), digital signals are fed from the digital signal
input (1), and the analogue output signal of which D/A

converter is converted in the A/D converter (5) into
digital signals at the first sampling frequency (f
2
),

characterized
 in that the A/D converter (5) and the D/A
converter (9) are connected to a common reference

voltage source (UR) in order to ensure corresponding
drive-level ranges.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, in which the
analogue output signal of the D/A converter (9) that is

fed to the A/D converter (5) passes through a filter
(FI), which is matched to the lowest of the sampling 

frequencies or can be changed over as a function of the
sampling frequency.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
the digital signals at the digital signal input (1)

firstly pass through an AES receiver (3) forming a
digital interface.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the A/D converter (5) and the D/A converter (9)

are arranged in one circuit in order to prevent
extraneous signal interference.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which the first sampling frequency (f
2
) is 44.1 kHz and
the second sampling frequency (f
1
, f
3
) is 32 kHz or
48 kHz.
Method for the recording (6, 7) and
reproduction (7, 8) of digital signals at a first

sampling frequency (f
2
), in which:

a digital input signal (1) has a first (f
2
) or a
second, different sampling frequency (f
1
, f
3
) and, in
the case of the first sampling frequency, is made

available for recording (6, 7);
or an analogue input signal (2) is made available for
recording (6, 7) by means of an A/D converter (5),

which operates at the first sampling frequency (f
2
);
in the case of digital input signals at the second
sampling frequency (f
1
, f
3
), the said signals are fed to
a D/A converter (9), which is arranged upstream of a

reproduction output (10) and the analogue output signal
of which is converted in the A/D converter (5) into

digital signals at the first sampling frequency (f
2
),
characterized
 in that the A/D converter (5) and the D/A
converter (9) are connected to a common reference

voltage source (UR) in order to ensure corresponding
drive-level ranges.
Method according to Claim 6, in which an
information carrier (7) in disc/disk form is used for

recording. 
Method according to Claim 6, in which an
information carrier (7) in tape form is used for

recording.
Method according to Claim 6, in which the
information carrier (7) is an information carrier

signal of a transmitter transmitting digital
information signals.
