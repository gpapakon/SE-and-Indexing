<ABSTRACT>
The efficiency of LC displays is improved by the use of a 
polymeric chiral nematic liquid crystal rear polarizer and 

reflective backlight housing which increases the net transmission 
of light and, at the same time, reduces the weight of the 

assemblage and increases battery life by utilizing lower levels 
of illumination. The polymeric chiral nematic liquid crystal can 

be a freestanding film or films, or can be supported by a single 
glass substrate. The liquid crystal polarizer can have a 

bandwidth sufficient to transmit electromagnetic radiation across 
the entire visible spectrum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to display devices and, more
particularly, to high efficiency polarizers in applications such
as active matrix liquid crystal (LC) displays.In the prior art, the brightness of a liquid crystal display
(such as a computer terminal screen) has been adversely affected
by absorptive elements in the optical path. For example, the
front and rear polarizers in a conventional twisted nematic
liquid crystal display assembly can absorb more than two thirds
(2/3) of the overall luminance emitted by the backlight. Display
brightness can be enhanced by ensuring that more light is
transmitted, either by increasing the backlight intensity or
reducing the amount of light lost in the absorptive elements.Increasing the backlight intensity has the major drawbacks
of higher power dissipation (leading to shortened battery life
for portable equipment) and shortened backlight bulb life.
Although power dissipation and battery size and life are ever
present challenges, the prior art fails to consider a closer
examination of the absorptive elements in backlit "direct view"
liquid crystal display applications, i.e. computer screens or
televisions, with the goal of reducing the absorption
conventional polarizers are made from stretched polyvinyl alcohol 
films containing iodine (or a dye if color is desired) between
layers of cellulose acetate, attached to a glass surface with an
acrylic adhesive and covered by a layer of plastic. Transmission
does not exceed 40%, efficiency is lost over time, and polarizers
are an expensive component in the manufacture of LCDs. According
to the present invention, in a direct view application (such as a
computer or television screen), the conventional rear polarizers
are replaced with a high efficiency, non-absorptive chiral
nematic liquid crystal polarizer whose transimissiveness is
substantially greater than the absorptive polarizers of the prior
art.The concept of liquid crystal devices (LCDs) as display
elements is familiar. The effect of electrical current through
an LC display element backlit with polarized light produces the
well-known "black line segments" which are featured in everything
from digital watch displays to laptop computer screen text. By
contrast, the application of a liquid crystal as a polarizer is
not at all familiar or common. Before discussing the scant prior
art which discusses liquid crystal polarizers, an overview of the
characteristics of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) is
necessary to provide a basis for illustrating the present
