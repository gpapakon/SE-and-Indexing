<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a high purity 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
comprises producing a crude 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone by 

mixing and heating one or more kinds of phenol and sulfuric acid to 
bring them into reaction with each other in the presence of at least one 

kind of catalyst selected from phosphonic acid, phosphinic acid and salts 
thereof in the absence of a solvent or in the presence of an aromatic 

hydrocarbon solvent having a boiling point at atmospheric pressure of 
130 to 200°C and purifying the crude 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone thus 

produced using (1) a mixed solvent containing 5 to 20 weight % of at least 
one kind selected from lower aliphatic alcohols and 95 to 80 weight % of 

at least one kind selected from aromatic hydrocarbons not containing 
halogen, (2) a mixed solvent containing 10 to 40 weight % of at least one 

kind selected from ketones and 90 to 60 weight % of at least one kind 
selected from aromatic hydrocarbons not containing halogen or (3) a 

mixed solvent containing 10 to 40 weight % of at least one kind selected 
from esters of acetic acid and 90 to 60 weight % of at least one kind 

selected from aromatic hydrocarbons not containing halogen. According 
to the method, 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone useful as developer for 

thermal recording paper can be produced efficiently with high selectivity 
and a high purity product can be obtained efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method of producing a 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone. 
More particularly, it relates to a method of 
producing a 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone useful as developer for 
thermal recording paper efficiently with high selectivity from phenols 
and sulfuric acid. The present invention also relates to a novel method of producing a 
high purity 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone. More particularly, it relates 
to a method of producing a high purity 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
useful as developer for thermal recording paper efficiently by purifying a 
crude 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone produced from phenols and 
sulfuric acid. Various kinds of phenol compounds have heretofore been proposed 
as developer for thermal recording paper. Among the phenol 
compounds, 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones have been expected to 
provide very useful developer for thermal recording paper. Method of producing 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones has 
heretofore been studied extensively and much efforts have been made to 
obtain high purity 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones by minimizing 
formation of 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones which are isomers thereof.  
 
However, it is the real situation that no method of producing 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
with increased yield have heretofore been 
reported. Furthermore, when 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones are produced 
by the reaction of phenols with sulfuric acid, high purity products useful 
as developer for thermal recording paper have not been obtained. For 
example, when 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone is produced by the 
reaction of phenol and sulfuric acid, a mixture of isomers containing 
2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone and 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone in a 
weight ratio of about 20 to 80 is obtained even under the optimum reaction 
condition. When 5-methyl-2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone is produced by 
using phenol and p-cresol as the material phenols, or when 3,5-dimethyl-2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
is produced by using phenol and 
2,4-xylenol as the material phenols, a product containing at most 10 to 20 
weight % of the 2,4'-dihydroxy isomer is obtained in either case. Method of purifying 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones has heretofore 
been studied extensively and much efforts have been made to obtain high 
purity 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones by minimizing the content of 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones 
which are isomers thereof. However, it is the 
real situation that no method of purifying 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfones 
with increased
