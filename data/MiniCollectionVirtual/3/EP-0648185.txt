<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hollow cylinder (W) designed for use as a roll drum, transport box etc. In order to ensure, in particular, optimum empty storage, empty return transport, etc., the invention proposes that a coupling point (K) is provided between two end surfaces (2) of the hollow-cylinder wall (1, 27) which abut in the direction of the cylinder circumference, and that the cylinder has at least one hinge point (S) located on the outside (5) of the wall (1, 27).

Hollow cylinder (W) constructed as a winding core, 
shipping container or the like the casing wall (1,27) of 

which can be opened through a coupling point (K) and 
consists of individual casing wall sections (1',1",1''') 

which are interconnected through hinge points (S) and from 
the position of a flat corrugation can be connected to form 

a closed ring, characterised in that the end surfaces (2) 
of the casing wall sections (1',1",1''') oriented towards 

the centre (Z) of the hollow cylinder (W) push against one 
another in the circumferential direction in the closed ring 

position and the hinge points (S) are formed from an 
adhesive strip (13) extending on the outside (5) of the 

casing wall. 
Hollow cylinder according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the coupling point (K) is formed from an adhesive 

strip (4) extending in the manner of a bandage. 
Hollow cylinder according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that a part region of the adhesive strip 

(4) rests on an adhesive-repelling part surface (8) of the 
casing wall (1).
 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised by a handle strap (10) on 

the adhesive strip (4). 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised by an additional adhesive 

strip (14) bridging the hinge point (S) on the inside (11) 
of the casing wall (1), the central section (15) of which 

is folded in against the end surface (2) of the casing wall 
(1). 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the  
 

preceding claims, characterised in that issuing from one 
(2) of the end surfaces (2) associated with the coupling 

point (K) on the inside (11) of the casing wall (1) there 
is an adhesive-repelling coating (12) which is at least as 

long as the actively adhesive projecting length (Ãœ) of the 
adhesive strip (4) beyond this end surface (2). 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised by a clamping collar (26) 

enclosing the casing wall (27). 
Hollow cylinder according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that issuing from the clamping collar (26) there are 

clamping means (lever fasteners 29) oriented in the axial 
direction which engage on an end cover (23) of the hollow 

cylinder (W). 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the engaging means 

(hook 31) of the cover (23) are seated at the limb ends 
(33) of a U-shaped clip (32) catching over the cover (23). 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that from a clamping 

collar (30) inwardly oriented brackets (34) issue which 
pass through slots (35) of the casing wall (27) of the 

hollow cylinder (W) and project as far as the interior of 
the hollow cylinder (W). 
Hollow cylinder according to Claim 10, characterised 
in that the brackets (34) form bearing surfaces for a base 

(25) inlaid into the hollow cylinder (W). 
Hollow cylinder according to Claim 11, characterised 
in that the brackets (34) issue from the border edge of the 

clamping collar (30).  
 
Hollow cylinder according to one or several of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the border edge 

(25') of the base (25) is overlapped by an elastic profile 
(36).
