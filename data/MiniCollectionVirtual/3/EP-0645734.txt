<ABSTRACT>
A method for enhancing the contour fidelity of printed images of two or more colors 
is described, which includes obtaining a digital representation of the color image and finding 

color separations of each color. Each color separation is enhanced by a single set of inverse 
symmetrical templates, the set including templates in which the second template is always the 

inverse of the first, and the third and fourth templates are 180 degree rotations of the first two. 
The resulting smoothed color separations are recombined into an enhanced image without 

separation error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for enhancing contour fidelity of printed images
including first and second colors.Images often contain many transitions. For instance, black and white and other dual tone
images have transitions at the boundaries between their foreground features and their
backgrounds, such as the transitions that demark line edges, font contours, and halftone dot
patterns. Color images commonly include still additional transitions at the boundaries between
differently colored foreground features. Consequently, the perceived quality of monotone and color
prints tends to be strongly dependent upon the precision with which the printing process spatially
positions these transitions.In response to these technical challenges, template matching techniques have been
proposed for more precisely controlling the size, positioning and number of picture elements
("pixels") that are printed on xerographic photoreceptors to render bitmapped images. For
example, template matching has been developed for reducing the severity of certain printing
artifacts, such as the observable stairstep-like scan structure (commonly referred to as "jaggies")
that sometimes degrades the xerographically printed appearance of nonvertical and nonhorizontal
lines. Examples of template matching techniques which may improve the output of images may be
found in Tung, U.S.-A- 4,847,641, "Piece-wise Print Image Enhancement for Dot Matrix Printers,"
issued July 11, 1989, and Walsh et al., U.S.-A- 4,437,122, "Low Resolution Raster Images," issued
March 13, 1984. Template matching effectively overcomes some of the sampling errors that are
caused by the use of input data that is too coarse to accurately represent the higher spatial
frequency content of the image.However, in multiple color images, processing is generally performed on the pixels of a
single color, called a color "separation." Standard template matching techniques, when applied to
color separations, tend to introduce "separation errors. Figs. 1-6 illustrate the problem of
separation errors. Fig. 1 shows a portion 10 of a two-color image composed of "R" pixels (for
example, red pixels) and "G" pixels (for example, green pixels). This image could further be
composed of black pixels and other color or colors pixels -- For the purposes of this application,
black pixels may be considered colored pixels. In processing a color image, the colors are
separated into multiple images, each of a single color, called "separations." Fig. 2 shows the G
color separation 20 of

A method for enhancing the contour fidelity of printed images
including first and second colors, the method including:


obtaining a digital representation of a portion of an image including
pixels of a first color and pixels of a second color;
