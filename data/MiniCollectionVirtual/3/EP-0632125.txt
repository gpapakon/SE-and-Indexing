<ABSTRACT>
A metal working oil composition having a kinematic 
viscosity of 20 cSt or less at a temperature of 40°C is 

herein disclosed which comprises (A) 10% by weight or more 
of an n-α-olefin (e.g. 1-hexadecene) and (B) an overbased 

sulfonate having a total base number of 350 mg·KOH/g or 
more in such an amount that the total base number of the 

composition is 12.5 mg·KOH/g or more. The metal working 
oil composition is particularly suitable as a press lubricant 

for aluminum alloys, has an excellent mass workability, 
and is more excellent in coating workability, lubricity, 

degreasing properties, weldability, etc. than a conventional 
solid coating type lubricant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel metal
working oil composition. More specifically, it relates to
a metal working oil composition which is particularly
suitable as a press lubricant for aluminum alloys and which
is more excellent in coating workability, lubricity, degreasing
properties, weldability and the like than a conventional
solid coating type lubricant.In recent years, high-strength aluminum alloys have
admirably been used as materials for parts of cars, rolling
stocks, ships, airplanes and the like from the viewpoint of
weight lightening which leads to fuel saving. Since these
high-strength aluminum alloys are poor in plastic workability,
an acrylic polymer-based or a wax-based solid coating
type lubricant has usually been used as a working lubricant.However, the solid coating type lubricant is poor
in mass workability and insufficient in coating workability,
lubricity, degreasing properties and weldability in
view of (1) that a coating system (a roll coater and a
drying step) is additionally required to be installed in a
plate manufacturing process, (2) that the coating film is
liable to partially peel by contact peeling and blocking,
and the partial peeling is not restorable, which causes 
press failure, (3) that a degreased film floats in a tank,
and in consequence, the service life of a degreasing liquid
is shortened, and (4) that welding failure is more liable
to occur as compared with an oil system (particularly in
the case of a resin coating type).If a liquid press lubricant having a low viscosity
is developed which can solve the above-mentioned problems
of the conventional solid coating type lubricant and which
is excellent in mass workability, the aluminum materials
can be applied to car bodies and the like by the use of
this liquid press lubricant, whereby the liquid press
lubricant can contribute to an industrial field in points
of energy saving and the like.Under such circumstances, an object of the present
invention is to provide a low-viscosity metal working oil
composition having an excellent mass workability which is
particularly suitable as a press lubricant for aluminum
alloys and which is more excellent in coating workability,
lubricity, degreasing properties, weldability and the like
than a conventional solid coating type lubricant.EP-A-484 542 discloses a lubricating oil composition for metal working
of aluminium alloys comprising a straight chain olefin having 6 to 40
carbon atoms and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of
alcoholglycol,
