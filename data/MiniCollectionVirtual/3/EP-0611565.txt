<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the use of (i) at least one
kind of powder or (ii) at least one silicone oil selected from the
group consisting of dimethyl polysiloxane and methylphenyl polysiloxane
having a viscosity of 2 - 20 cs at 25°C in the preparation of an
external skin treatment composition comprising vitamin A for
preventing stickiness caused by vitamin A.It is known in the art that vitamin A is an
effective component capable of preventing and treating
skin hyperkeratosis and of preventing and recovering skin
aging. However, vitamin A has a strong sticky feeling
when applied, in addition to the above-mentioned effects,
and therefore, this is a weakness of vitamin A when
formulated into an external skin treatment composition.It is also known from European Patent
Application n° 0255364 anhydrous cosmetic preparations
for improving the appearance of the skin, comprising an
emollient, a thickening agent and a working ingredient
such as Vitamin A.European Patent Application n° 0440398 discloses skin
care compositions comprising a water-in-oil emulsion, an
antioxydant system, a chelating agent and a retinoid.None of these documents do relate to stickiness caused by
Vitamin A nor to a solution to this problem. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is
to provide an external skin treatment composition capable
of preventing stickiness caused by vitamin A, when
formulated into an external skin treatment composition,
and capable of remarkably improving the usability of
vitamin A.The present invention is directed to the use of (i) a
least one kind of powder of (ii) at least one silicone oil selected
from the group consisting of dimethyl polysiloxane and methylphenyl
polysiloxane having a viscosity of 2 - 20 cs at 25°C in the
preparation of an external skin treatment composition comprising
vitamin A for preventing stickiness caused by vitamin A.Vitamin A used in the present invention is also
called retinol and all-trans products or 13-cis products
can be preferably used, but the mixture thereof can also
be used. There are no limitations to the amounts of vitamin A
formulated into the external skin treatment composition
according to the present invention, but the preferable
amount is 0.0001 to 5% by weight, more preferably 0.001
to 0.5% by weight, in view of the effect of vitamin A to
the skin.The powders used in the present invention include,
for example, organic polymer powders such as nylon
powder, polyethylene powder, cellulose powder, acrylic
resin, etc., inorganic pigments, sintered
