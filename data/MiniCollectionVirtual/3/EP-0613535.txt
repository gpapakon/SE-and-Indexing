Micromechanical valve for micromechanical dosing devices, 
consisting of at least three layers which are arranged one 

above the other, are connected locally unreleasably to one 
another and are coupled to an actuation element (4), the 

layers having planar structures for forming inlet and 
outlet channels (7, 8) or inlet and outlet chambers (5, 

6), the outer layers being designed as a base layer (1) 
and a cover layer and the layer arranged between the inlet 

and outlet being designed as a thin elastic valve diaphragm 
(2), characterized in that the thin elastic valve 

diaphragm (2) is designed with channel-forming and 
chamber-forming structures for inlet and outlet formed in 

both sides, in that the valve diaphragm (2) has a centre 
passage (9), in that the valve diaphragm (2) is connected 

in its central region unreleasably to the cover layer 
designed as a thin drive diaphragm (3, 13), in that the 

valve diaphragm (2) rests with its central region on the 
inner surface of the base layer (1), only when the valve 

is in the closed state, so that the flowing-in of the 
medium into the valve takes place via inlet channel (7), 

inlet chamber (5) as far as the centre passage (9), and, 
on opening of the valve, the throughflow of the medium 

takes place further through outlet chamber (6) and outlet 
channel (8), and in that the actuation element (4) is 

arranged on the outer surface of the thin drive diaphragm 
(3, 13). 
Micromechanical valve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the elastic valve diaphragm (2) is formed in that 

all channel-forming and chamber-forming structures for 
inlet and outlet are formed in both sides of the separating 

layer such that the centres of gravity of their areas  
 

lie one above the other. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that inlet and outlet chamber (5, 6) have essentially 

the same shape and size. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the inlet chamber (5) is arranged between 

the drive diaphragm (3) and the valve diaphragm (2) and 
the outlet chamber (6) is arranged between the valve diaphragm 

(2) and base layer (1), and in that the inlet 
channel (7) and the outlet channel (8) are disposed opposite 

one another in a laterally offset manner. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at least one connection element (10) which projects 

into the inlet chamber (5) as far as the drive diaphragm 
(3) and which is arranged at a distance from one 

another is connected unreleasably to the drive diaphragm 
(3) in the central region of the valve diaphragm (2), 

encircling the passage designed as passage hole (9). 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 and 5, characterized 
in that a valve wall (11) is arranged in the central 

region of the valve diaphragm (2), encircling the 
passage hole (9), at the outlet side, which valve wall 

(11) bears against the inner surface of the base layer (1) 
in the non-actuated state. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 and 6, characterized 
in that a thin layer (12) of nonbondable material, 

such as silicon oxide or silicon nitrite, is arranged 
between the bearing surface of the valve wall (11) and the 

inner surface of the base layer (1). 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the base layer (1), valve diaphragm (2) 

and drive diaphragm (3) are unreleasably connected to one  
 

another, preferably by means of anodic bonding. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the base layer (1) and drive diaphragm (3) 

preferably consists of a thermally adapted glass material 
and the valve diaphragm (2) consists of a semiconducting 

silicon substrate. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the cover layer consists of a semiconducting silicon 

substrate, in the outer surface of which a recess for 
the actuation element (4) is formed, the remaining layer 

forms the drive diaphragm surface (13) an inlet chamber 
and outlet chamber (5, 6) are designed differently in 

shape and size. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the cover layer and separating layer are connected 

unreleasably by means of wafer bonding and the separating 
layer is connected unreleasably to the base layer by anodic 

bonding. 
Micromechanical valve according to Claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that a piezoelectric diaphragm excitation element, 

preferably in the form of a piezodisc, is arranged 
as actuation element (4) by adhesion bonding onto the 

outer surface of the drive diaphragm (3).

in that thermoelectric or electrostatic diaphragm 

excitation elements are arranged on the drive diaphragm 
(3) for activation of the valve diaphragm (2).
