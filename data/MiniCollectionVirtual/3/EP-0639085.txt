<ABSTRACT>
Sterilization indicator tapes utilizing moisture-resistant, water-dispersible, pressure sensitive adhesives are provided. The indicator tapes comprise a non-water-dispersible backing having a sterilization indicator thereon, which is coated on at least one side with the moisture-resistant, water-dispersible, pressure sensitive adhesive. The indicator tapes are useful to maintain a sterilization wrapper containing articles to be sterilized in a closed position during sterilization, and normal pre- and post-sterilization handling, while also providing a means to indicate if the wrapped articles have passed through a sterilization cycle. After use, the adhesives coating the indicator tapes disperse in aqueous alkali solutions, such as are found in commercial laundries, while the backing ramains intact. Methods of making and using the indicator tapes are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sterilization indicator tapes utilizing water-dispersible 
pressure sensitive adhesives and to methods of using the same. A variety of products such as gowns, sheets, drapes, instruments, etc. 
which are required during surgery, or other aseptic procedures, are used on a daily basis 
in the normal operation of hospitals, clinics and the like. Where such products are not 
pre-packaged in a sterile state, it is necessary for the hospital or clinic to sterilize them 
before use. Furthermore, where these products are not disposable, and are employed 
more than once, it is necessary that they be cleaned and otherwise prepared for subsequent 
use. Prior to such use, however, it is essential that such products be sterilized. Due to the volume of materials involved, it is often necessary to sterilize 
and store these products for use as desired. Accordingly, there has been developed a 
procedure where such products, after cleaning, laundering and the like, are packaged in 
cloth sterilization wrappers for subsequent use, and the wrapped package is then sterilized 
and stored. As may be apparent, there is a potential danger in such a procedure. There 
is a prospect of unsterilized packages becoming mixed with sterilized packages when 
stored for use. To prevent unsterilized products from being used by the physician or 
attendant requiring sterile materials, various types of sterility indicators which are attached 
to, or incorporated into, the wrapped sterilization package have been developed. This 
permits a user to immediately determine whether a particular package has been passed 
through the sterilizer. Although such sterilization indicators have, in many instances, been 
placed in the wrapped package or attached to the wrapped package, the most convenient 
way of applying such sterilization indicators is to have the sterilization indicators carried 
by pressure sensitive adhesive indicator tapes used for holding the cloth wrapper in a 
closed position prior to, during, and after sterilization of the enclosed products. Various pressure sensitive adhesives have been used with tape backings that 
include appropriate color changing means to indicate if the package has been exposed to 
sterilization conditions. Examples of pressure sensitive adhesives employed with such 
indicator tapes include water insoluble natural rubber based adhesives, natural rubber and  
 
synthetic rubber blend adhesives, styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers with 
tackifying resins, vinyl ethers, and high
