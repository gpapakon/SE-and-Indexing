<ABSTRACT>
An image sensing assembly for sensing an image during 
relative scanning movement between the image and the 

assembly. The assembly comprises a first sensor (8) having 
a two dimensional array of sensing elements (14-17) 

responsive to incident light to accumulate a charge related 
to the light incident thereon, and control means for 

transferring the accumulated charge to successive sensing 
elements of the array in the scanning direction for 

accumulation with charge derived for the same image pixel 
by each successive sensing element. A second sensor (10) 

comprises a one dimensional array of sensing elements 
extending substantially orthogonal to the scanning 

direction. A processor (13) outputs signals for each pixel 
of the image as the corresponding accumulated charge from 

the first sensor (8), or the corresponding charge from the 
second sensor (10), or a combination of the two.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to image sensing assemblies, for 
example for use in scanning an image carried on a moving 
drum or other support such as a flat bed. Recently, an image sensor has been developed which 
comprises a two dimensional array of sensing elements such 
as charge coupled devices which are responsive to incident 
light to accumulate a charge related to the light incident 
thereon. During relative scanning movement between an 
image focused onto the sensor and the sensor itself, 
accumulated charge is transferred from one sensing element 
to the next in the scanning direction so that an individual 
pixel in the image is sensed by a line of sensing elements 
until a final accumulated charge is obtained and read out. 
An example of such an assembly is the Philtec line-scan 
camera manufactured by Wessex Technology. One problem 
with such a sensor is that the output value for each pixel 
is limited to eight bits and for certain types of image it 
is desirable to be able to extend the dynamic range of the 
sensor. For example, it is difficult to get such charge-coupled 
devices to cover the density ranges present in the 
typical photographic transparency. It is easy to get 8 or 
9 bit luminance data from CCD detectors, but difficult and 
expensive to get the 14 or more bits required for 
transparency densities of 3.5 and over. In accordance with the present invention, an image 
sensing assembly for sensing an image during relative 
scanning movement between the image and the assembly 
comprises a first sensor having a two dimensional array of 
sensing elements responsive to incident light to accumulate 
a charge related to the light incident thereon, and control 
means for transferring the accumulated charge to successive 
sensing elements of the array in the scanning direction for 
accumulation with charge derived for the same image pixel 
by each successive sensing element; a second sensor 
comprising a one dimensional array of sensing elements  
 
extending substantially orthogonal to the scanning 
direction; and processing means for outputting signals for 
each pixel of the image as the corresponding accumulated 
charge from the first sensor, or the corresponding charge 
from the second sensor, or a combination of the two. With this invention, an additional, second sensor is 
added which enables the dynamic range of the overall 
assembly to be significantly increased. The signals from 
the second sensor will be used where a high level of 
exposure is achieved while for low exposures the
