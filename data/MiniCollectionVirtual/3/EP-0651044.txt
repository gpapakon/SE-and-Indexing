<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising one or 
more vegetable oils that possess at least 60 percent monounsaturation 
content, one or more oils that are transesterified and at least one pour 
point depressant. In addition to pour point depressants, the compositions 
also contain a performance additive generally intended to enhance the 
performance of the vegetable oil and transesterified product when used in 
hydraulic fluids, two-cycle (two stroke) internal combustion engines, gear 
oils, and passenger car motor oils. The product of this invention has utility as a lubricant. Lubricants can be 
classified into two broad categories, engine and non-engine lubricants. Further 
breakdown of these two classes is given below. 1. Gasoline engine oils 2. Diesel engine oils 
Automotive diesel oils Stationary diesel oils Railroad diesel oils Marine diesel oils 3. Natural gas engine oils 4. Aviation engine oils 5. Two-stroke cycle engine oils 1. Transmission fluids 
Automatic transmission fluids Manual transmission fluids Power transmission fluids 2. Power steering fluids 3. Shock absorber fluids 4. Gear oils 
Automotive gear oils Industrial gear oils 5. Hydraulic fluids 
Tractor hydraulic fluids Industrial hydraulic fluids 6. Metalworking fluids 7. Miscellaneous industrial oils 8. Greases Successful use of esters of transesterified natural oils in combination with 
high monounsaturation vegetable oils as environmentally friendly, that is 
biodegradable, base fluids in industrial applications and also as a fuel additive 
when mixed with normally liquid fuels, is contingent upon improving their low 
temperature viscometries. For example, a methyl ester obtained from the 
transesterification of rapeseed oil, has utility as an environmentally friendly diesel 
fuel. However, this methyl ester has a pour point of -12°C and solidifies at 
13.6°C which results in clogged filters and engine failure. A sunflower oil 
containing an oleic acid content of 80 percent has a pour point of -12°C and also 
solidifies. Many of the industrial applications require a pour point of less than -25°C 
and a Brookfield viscosity of 7500 to 110,000 centiPoises (cP) at -25°C. In 
order to take advantage of the biodegradability of transesterified esters of natural 
oils in combination with high monounsaturation vegetable oils it becomes 
necessary to lower the pour point. U.S. Patent No. 2,243,198 (Dietrich, May 27, 1941)relates to non-viscous 
normally liquid hydrocarbon oils and more particularly to the production of fuel
