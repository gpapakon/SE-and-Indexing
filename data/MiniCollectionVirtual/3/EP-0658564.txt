<DESCRIPTION>
Within this application several publications are referenced
by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full
citations for these references may be found at the end
of the specification immediately preceding the claims.There is a continuous and expanding need for rapid,
highly specific methods of detecting and quantifying
chemical, biochemical, and biological substances. Of
particular value are methods for measuring small quantities
of pharmaceuticals, metabolites, microorganisms
and other materials of diagnostic value. Examples of
such materials include narcotics and poisons, drugs
administered for therapeutic purposes, hormones, pathogenic
microorganisms and viruses, antibodies, metabolites,
enzymes and nucleic acids.The presence of these materials can often be determined
by binding methods which exploit the high degree of
specificity which characterizes many biochemical and
biological systems. Frequently used methods are based
on, for example, antigen-antibody systems, nucleic acid
hybridization techniques, and protein-ligand systems.
In these methods, the existence of a complex of diagnostic
value is typically indicated by the presence or
absence of an observable "label" which has been attached
to one or more of the complexing materials. The specific labeling method chosen often dictates the
usefulness and versatility of a particular system for
detecting a material of interest. A preferred label
should be inexpensive, safe, and capable of being attached
efficiently to a wide variety of chemical, biochemical,
and biological materials without changing the
important binding characteristics of those materials.
The label should give a highly characteristic signal,
and should be rarely, and preferably never, found in
nature. The label should be stable and detectable in
aqueous systems over periods of time ranging up to
months. Detection of the label should be rapid, sensitive,
and reproducible without the need for expensive,
specialized facilities or personnel. Quantification
of the label should be relatively independent of variables
such as temperature and the composition of the
mixture to be assayed. Most advantageous are labels
which can be used in homogeneous systems, i.e., systems
in which separation of the complexed and uncomplexed
labeled material is not necessary. This is possible if
the detectability of the label is modulated when the
labeled material is incorporated into a specific complex.A wide variety of labels have been developed, each with
particular advantages and disadvantages. For example,
