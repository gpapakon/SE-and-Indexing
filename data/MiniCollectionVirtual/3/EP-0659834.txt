<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polycarbonate
compositions comprising blends which contain
thermoplastic olefin copolymers. The thermoplastic olefin
copolymer blends are prepared from precursor
functionalized olefin polymers and functionalized addition
polymers under reactive conditions. The resulting
polycarbonate compositions unexpectedly display improved
physical properties.Plastics are conventionally divided into two
distinct and important groups: thermoplastics and
thermosetting materials. Thermoplastics are those which
melt to become viscous liquids when heated and solids when
cooled. They are characterized by their flexibility as well
as their ability to be repeatedly softened and hardened.
Examples of common thermoplastics include acrylic, nylon,
polyesters, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene. Conversely,
thermosetting materials are those which can only be heated
and shaped once and, thus, they are not reworkable. Further,
thermosetting materials are often hard, rigid, insoluble and
infusable. Illustrative examples of such materials include
phenolics, epoxies and unsaturated polyesters.It is of increasing interest to prepare
polycarbonate blends that comprise toughened
thermoplastics since they are often employed in many
commercial applications. Commercial methods for 
toughening thermoplastics usually involve blending into the
plastic an elastomer having a low glass transition
temperature. Often, however, the immiscibility and
incompatibility of the elastomer with the thermoplastic
produce poor physical properties in the blend. A
compatibilization strategy is then required to improve
physical properties. Said strategy typically involves
incorporating copolymers prepared from the thermoplastic
and the elastomer in the blend. The copolymer serves to
improve rubber phase dispersion and adhesion, and thereby
improves compatibility and physical properties of the blend.An example of such polycarbonate blends is one
which comprises acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)
terpolymers. However, due to the presence of unsaturated
polybutadiene rubber, these blends are susceptible to
thermal and photochemical degradation. As a result of this,
ABS has limited uses in outdoor applications.Accordingly, the instant invention is directed to
novel polycarbonate compositions comprising blends which
contain thermoplastic olefin copolymers. Said
thermoplastic olefin copolymers are prepared from
reactions of ortho compound functionalized olefin polymers
and acid, acid anhydride or thiol functionalized addition
polymer
