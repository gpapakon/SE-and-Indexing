Method for embodying a display cell in which: 

a counter-electrode (CE) is placed on a first transparent plate (P1), 
a polymerizable glue cord (10) is placed on the circumference of the 
counter-electrode, 
contact blocks (12) are placed on the counter-electrode outside the glue 
cord (10) at appropriate locations and made from a glue which crosslinks at a 

temperature higher than the temperature for polymerizing the glue of the 
cord (10), 
addressing rows (L) and columns (C) and pixel electrodes (Px) are placed 
on a second plate (P2), 
counter-electrode connection contacts (20) are formed at the periphery of 
this second plate (P2), 
a non-conducting passivation film coating (22) inter alia covering the 
counter-electrode contacts (20) is placed on this second plate (P2), 
the two plates (P1, P2) are assembled and the glue cord (10) is polymerized, 

the contact blocks (12) borne by the first plate (P1) being disposed above 
the counter-electrode contacts (20) carried by the second plate (P2) but 

remaining separate from the latter by means of the passivation film (22), 
the blocks (12) are exposed to a laser beam (30) having sufficient power 
so as to calcine the glue of the blocks and render it conductive over the 

entire height of the block (12), 
with the aid of the laser beam (30), the passivation film (22) is in 
addition perforated above the counter-electrode contacts (20) and at least 

the counter-electrode contacts (20) are partly perforated. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein: 

on a first large plate (40) is placed several counter-electrode patterns 
(42), 
polymerizable glue cords (44) are disposed on the first large plate (40) 
around counter-electrode patterns (42), 
the contact blocks (46) are placed on the first large plate (50), 
deposition takes place on a second large plate (50) having the same number 
of electrode units (52) as counter-electrode patterns, with counter-electrode 

contacts (54) and a passivation film, 
the two large plates (40, 50) are assembled,  
 
the blocks (46) are partly calcined over their height and the passivation 
film is perforated with the laser beam (30), the large plates (40, 50) still 

being assembled, 
the assembly is cut so as to separate the various cells, 
each cell is filled and sealed.
