<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an encapsulated contact material 
to be used in an encapsulated contact of, for example, a lead 
switch and a process for producing the same. More particularly, 
it relates to an encapsulated contact material, which shows a low 
contact resistance and remains stable in a make-and-break action 
and has a long operating life, and a process for producing the 
same at a low cost. An encapsulated contact has a structure comprising a 
container made of, for example, glass, metals or ceramics and a 
contact material being hermetically encapsulated therein. As encapsulated contact materials, there have been used 
substrates made of alloys such as Fe/Ni and having a surface 
coated with, for example, Rh or Ru. This is because Rh and Ru 
have large electric conductivity, high hardness, high melting 
point and excellent resistance to abrasion. This encapsulated contact material is produced by plating 
the surface of a substrate with a metal such as Ag, Au or Cu and 
then further plating the surface of the plated metal with Rh or  
 
Ru. The plating of the surface of the substrate with a metal 
such as Ag, Au or Cu is performed in order to prevent the 
diffusion of Rh or Ru into the substrate in a make-and-break 
action on the contact and to elevate the adhesiveness of Rh or Ru 
constituting the surface of the contact portion (contact-coating 
layer) with the substrate. However, the above-mentioned encapsulated contact materials 
involve expensive Rh or Ru and thus cost a great deal. Under these circumstances, there has been proposed and 
expected much in recent years to use a contact material 
consisting of a substrate made of, for example, an Fe/Ni alloy 
similar to conventional ones and its surface being coated with 
Mo, W or an alloy thereof. The above-mentioned contact material is excellent in having 
a high hardness, a high melting point and a high electric 
conductivity, among properties required for encapsulated contact 
materials. However it has been clarified that this contact material 
shows the following behaviors. That is to say, when an encapsulated contact having an 
encapsulated contact material coated with W is tested by 
repeating make-and-break, for example, the contact resistance of 
the encapsulated contact material varies widely. In this case, 
furthermore, concentrated arching is often observed. A wide scatter of the contact resistance of an encapsulated 
contact material not only causes changes in the contact  
 
resistance during a make-and-break action of the
