<ABSTRACT>
A method of input signal resolution in a process control system where each of the actively redundant process control computers performs a common arbitration process on corresponding input signals. Blocks of corresponding input signals are mutually exchanged by the actively redundant process control computers, and an initial check is made to determine if these input signals are valid. For input signals representing valid analog values, a determination is made as to whether a predefined tolerance has been exceeded between corresponding input signals in the present process control cycle. When the predefined tolerance has been exceeded, then a check will be made to determine the predefined tolerance was also exceeded in the last process control cycle. If the predefined tolerance was not exceeded in the last process control cycle, then the analog input value selected during the last process control cycle will be employed in the present process control cycle. If the predefined tolerance was exceeded in both the present and the last process control cycle, then a predetermined magnitude criteria will be used to select the analog input value for use in making process control decisions. An indication will also be provided in each of the actively redundant process control computers to identify which of the corresponding input signals were selected by that process control computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the operation of process 
control computers, and particularly relates to a method of resolving the 
selection of corresponding input signals received by each of a plurality of 
actively redundant process control computers. In chemical manufacturing plants and other relatively large 
processing plants, a network of control computers and operator workstations 
may be needed to achieve automated control of an ongoing physical process in 
the plant. For example, the Jones et. al U.S. Patent No. 4,663,704, issued on 
May 5, 1987, shows a distributed processing system for a plant in which a single 
data highway connects all the various input/output terminals, data acquisition 
stations, control devices, record keeping devices and so forth. Similarly, the 
Henzel U.S. Patent No. 4,607,256, issued on August 19, 1986, shows a plant 
management system which utilizes a plant control bus for the purpose of 
transmitting data to physical computer modules on the network. In some of these process control computer networks, redundant 
process control computers are employed to enhance the reliability of the plant 
control and monitoring system. For example, the Fiebig et. al U.S. Patent No. 
5,008,805, issued on April 16, 1991, shows a networked control system which 
includes a "hot standby" redundant processor that synchronously processes a 
control schedule table for comparison with control messages from a sender 
processor that are transmitted on the network. The redundant listener 
processor maintains a duplicate configuration in its memory ready to take over 
control of the system in the event of a failure of the sender processor. As another 
example, the McLaughlin et. al U.S. Patent No. 4,958,270, issued on September 
18, 1990, shows a networked control system which employs a primary controller 
and a secondary controller. In order to maintain consistency between the 
primary data base and a secondary image of the data base, only predetermined 
areas changed are updated as a way of increasing the efficiency of the update 
function. Similarly, the Slater U.S. Patent No. 4,872,106, issued on October 3, 
1989, shows a networked control system which employs a primary data 
processor and a back-up data processor. Normally, the back-up processor will be 
in a back-up mode of operation, and it will not operate to exercise control over 
the input/output devices or receive data concerning the states of the 
input/output devices. Accordingly, control over the input/output devices
