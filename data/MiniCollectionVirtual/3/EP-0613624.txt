<ABSTRACT>
The helmet consists of a two-part plastic shell, the upper plastic shell (10) being supported by the lower plastic shell (10). The upper plastic shell (10) has an inner shell of shock-absorbing material with an inner shape which corresponds to the head of a child. The empty space between the child's head and the inner shell is filled with a cap (3) or filling pads. The gap (5) between the lower plastic shell (11) and the ear is filled by the ear flap part (4) of the cap (3) when the helmet is used with a cap.
