<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a process for the biological treatment of organically polluted waste water and damp organic waste comprising the following steps: (a) separation of the solids and their decomposition in a first stage in primarily aerobic conditions; (b) conveyance of the liquid part to a second decomposition stage in which decomposition takes place in anaerobic conditions; (c) further conveyance of the liquid part to a third decomposition stage in which decomposition takes place in aerobic conditions; and (d) the continuous feedback of the liquid part from the third to the first decomposition stage.

b) passing on the liquid portion into a second degradation 
stage (2), in which degradation proceeds under 

anoxic conditions, 
c) passing on the liquid portion from the second degradation 
stage into a third degradation stage (3), in

d) continuous recirculation by returning the liquid 
portion from the third degradation stage (3) to the 

first degradation stage (1).

degradation stage (3).

that a support structure (12) is present at least in the 

second degradation stage (2,2a), which support structure 
contains porous mineral particles and/or activated 

charcoal particles. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that an activated charcoal bed (11) is present in the 

second degradation stage (2,2a). 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that a support structure (12) according to Claim 3 is 
additionally present in the second degradation stage 

(2,2a). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it is intended for the biological 

purification of toilet waste water, and the liquid from 
the third degradation stage is used as flushing liquid 

for the toilets, the liquid from the third degradation 
stage (3) preferably being filtered and sterilized prior 

to its use as toilet flushing water or prior to its 
discharge into the environment, and the sterilization 

preferably being carried out by UV irradiation, pasteurization, 
anodic oxidation or by microfiltration or 

ultrafiltration, in particular crossflow filtration. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims 
1 to 6, characterized by a fourth degradation stage (2b), 


which is connected between the second degradation stage 
(2,2a) and the third degradation stage (3), and 
in which degradation proceeds under aerobic conditions. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that an activated charcoal bed (11) is present as support 

structure and in that, besides the activated charcoal bed 
(11), a support structure according to Claim 3 can 

additionally be present. 
Device for the biological treatment of organically 
polluted waste water and organic wastes, characterized 

by 

a) a first compartment (1) in which the solids portions 
of the organic substrate to be treated are separated 

off - and can be degraded under predominantly aerobic 
conditions, 
b) a second compartment (2) connected to the first 
compartment, in which second compartment biologically 

active support structures are arranged and in which 
the liquid which is substantially freed from solids 

portions can be degraded anaerobically, 
c) a third compartment (3) connected to the second 
compartment, in which third compartment biologically 

active support structures are arranged and in which  
 

the liquid can be degraded aerobically, and

third compartment (3) to the first compartment (1).
