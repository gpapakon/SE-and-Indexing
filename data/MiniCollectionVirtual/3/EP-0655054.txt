<ABSTRACT>
Sulphonates are prepared by the neutralisation of a sulphonic acid with a basic hydroxide or oxide. The process requires the staged addition of sulphonic acid to a reaction mixture comprising basic hydroxide or oxide dispersed in a water/diluent mixture; the reaction mixture is basic throughout the additions of acid and at least until the point of completion of the neutralisation reaction. The basic hydroxide or oxide may also be added in stages. The sulphonate product has low viscosity, low haze and good stability and is essentially chloride free as halide promoters are not utilised in the manufacture of the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of basic or neutral 
sulphonates and in particular to a method for the preparation of basic or neutral 
sulphonates which are essentially chloride free. Basic or neutral sulphonates may be used as additives for lubricating oils such as 
passenger car, diesel and marine engine lubricants. Basic sulphonate additives 
are generally known as either low base number sulphonates or high base number 
sulphonates. Neutral and low base number sulphonates function primarily as 
surfactants, detergents and rust inhibitors. High base number sulphonates 
primarily function to neutralise acids produced in the oil during use. These 
sulphonates also help to inhibit corrosion and reduce sedimentation during use. Neutral and low base number sulphonates for use as oil additives are usually 
prepared by the neutralisation of a sulphonic acid with a basic salt such as a basic 
calcium salt e.g. calcium oxide or hydroxide in a suitable diluent oil. The 
sulphonate product may be a mixture of a number of species; when calcium 
hydroxide is used these species may include the following: 
(i) Hydrated hydroxy calcium sulphonate 
(ii) A basic calcium sulphonate 
(iii) A calcium sulphonate 
(iv) A calcium sulphonate hydrate 
 
wherein R is an organic moiety and x denotes at least one molecule of water of 
hydration. In addition dispersed calcium hydroxide may be present. When preparing low base number sulphonates the basic salt is added in 
stoichiometric excess to that required for complete neutralisation of the sulphonic 
acid so that the resulting product is basic. EP-A-135920 describes the preparation of alkaline-earth metal salts of alkaryl 
sulphonic acids containing from 1.5 to less than 3 wt.% water without requiring 
azeotropic distillation using a polar solvent and by limiting the water in the reaction 
mixture. Preferably the sulphonic acid is "proportioned" into the reaction mixture 
(i.e. added at a rate to give the required rate of salt formation). The small amount 
of water may be introduced as a sulphonate solution. Basic materials such as 
amines are added at completion of the reaction to make the product basic. High base number sulphonates are generally prepared by a process of 
neutralisation and carbonation. The sulphonic acid is first neutralised with excess 
basic metal oxide or hydroxide in a suitable diluent. Some of the excess basic 
metal oxide or hydroxide is then converted to metal carbonate via carbonation. 
Typically the reaction is carried
