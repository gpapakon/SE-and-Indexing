<ABSTRACT>
A method to place anionic scale inhibitors in formations 
containing CaSO₄ is provided. The solution dissolves CaSO₄ when 

injected into the formation containing CaSO₄ causing calcium salts 
of the scale inhibitor to precipitate at a rate and to an extent 

that exceeds that resulting when an inhibitor solution not containing 
the salt is used. Precipitation of the calcium salt of scale 

inhibitor is maximized because salt reduces its solubility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method to place scale inhibitors 
within a subterranean formation. Slightly soluble inorganic salts, for example calcium carbonate, 
calcium sulphate, and barium sulphate, often precipitate from 
waters produced along with oil and gas. Such precipitation occurs 
because conditions that affect solubility, such as temperature and 
pressure, change in, or near, producing wellbores. Additionally, 
incompatible waters can mix with formation waters in or near the 
wellbore. Precipitates of slightly soluble salts are often called 
scale. Scale build-up occurs both within the near wellbore formation 
and within the wellbore equipment. Scale build-up within the 
formation decreases permeability and impairs well productivity. 
Scale build-up within wellbore equipment shortens equipment useful 
life and can plug production tubing. To minimize scaling, scale inhibitors can be placed within the 
formation by "squeeze" methods. Squeezing involves injecting the 
inhibitor and, usually, overflushing the treated zone with water or 
brine. The well is then placed back into production. Inhibitor in 
the produced waters protects the wellbore and downhole equipment 
from scale build-up. Squeezing inhibitor into the formation is a convenient way to 
apply an inhibitor. Continuous injection is not required, and the 
formation in the vicinity of the wellbore along with the wellbore 
equipment is protected. Most common scale inhibitors are effective 
in concentrations greater than about 1 to 100 parts per million. In 
a normal squeeze placement, it is difficult to control the concentration 
of inhibitor returning in produced brines. The inhibitors 
tend to be produced quickly, with concentrations quickly tailing 
off to ineffective amounts. This results in frequent shutdowns of 
production for squeezing operations, and also in excessive chemical 
costs.  Various attempts to control and delay inhibitor production 
have been only partially successful. For example, USA patent 
specification No. 3 483 925 discloses a method to provide a more 
gradual return of inhibitor by injection of the inhibitor with 
polymer-thickened slugs of solution. Injection of such thickened 
solutions would inhibit production of all fluids from the wellbore, 
and is therefore not a desirable method to provide a more gradual 
return of the inhibitor when production from the wellbore is 
desired. USA patent specifications No. 3 633 672 and No. 3 704 750 
disclose inhibitors which are only slightly soluble in neutral or 
basic

A method to reduce scale deposition in an aqueous phase 
producing wellbore and surrounding formation, wherein the formation 

comprises CaSO₄, the method comprising the steps of: 

a) providing a solution comprising an anionic scale inhibitor and 
a salt having a monovalent cation in a concentration effective to 

at least about double the solubility of calcium sulphate compared 
to a scale inhibitor solution in the absence of the salt having a 

monovalent cation; 
b) injecting the solution into the formation; 
c) precipitating a portion of the anionic scale inhibitor in the 
formation as a calcium salt of the anionic scale inhibitor; and 
d) producing the aqueous phase from the wellbore.
