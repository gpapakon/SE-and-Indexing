<ABSTRACT>
A cellular mobile radio system which is arrange to operate 
in accordance with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, 

wherein at least one time slot in each frame, referred to as an R-slot, 
is designated for the transmission of access contention data, 

which time slot includes a field reserved for data specifying a 
number of information slots referred to as I-slots required by a 

mobile unit, and which system includes a base station adapted for 
operation such that consequent upon receipt of data in the said 

reserved field, the base station is arranged to respond by the 
transmission of acknowledgement data in slots referred to as A-slots 

which data serves to facilitate the allocation of available slots 
so as to satisfy the requirement of the mobile unit, characterised 

in that the position of the R-slots is arranged to be the same in 
several successive frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile radio systems, 
which include a package reservation multiple access (PRMA) 
protocol. More especially it relates to an improvement in or 
modification of the invention which forms the subject of our co-pending 
GB Patent Application No. 9219824.1 to which attention is 
hereby directed. According to the invention which forms the subject of our 
co-pending patent application as aforesaid, a cellular mobile radio 
system is provided which is arranged to operate in accordance 
with a package reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at 
least one time slot in each frame, referred to as an R-slot, is 
designated for the transmission of access contention data, which 
time slot includes a field reserved for data specifying a number of 
information slots, referred to as I-slots required by a mobile unit, 
and which system includes a base station adapted for operation 
such that consequent upon receipt of data in the said reserved 
field, the base station is arranged to respond by the transmission 
of acknowledgement data in slots referred to as A-slots, which 
data serves to facilitate the allocation of available slots, so as to 
satisfy the requirement of the mobile unit. Since in this system the base station has a comprehensive 
knowledge of the current availability of information carrying 
slots, available slots can be allocated on the down-link (base to  
 
mobile) in response to slot requests in the field reserved for such 
requests, which requests are transmitted by the mobile unit IN 
the up-link (mobile to base). As will be well appreciated by those 
skilled in the art, since only one access contention request is 
required irrespective of the number of information slots required, 
the access contention time required to reserve capacity will be 
minimised OR at least substantially reduced as compared with a 
system in which individual slots must be contended for. In known PRMA protocols of the kind mentioned in our co-pending 
patent application as just before referred to, the 
R-slots/frame are changed depending on the traffic load 
experienced, and so mobiles must be informed by the base station 
of the latest number and position of the R-slots and A-slots as 
these are changing on a frame to frame basis. In order to provide 
data appertaining to the number and position of the R-slots and 
A-slots, a feedback channel from the base station, broadcasting to 
all mobiles in a cell is required. However, in practical systems 
with real propagation and processing
