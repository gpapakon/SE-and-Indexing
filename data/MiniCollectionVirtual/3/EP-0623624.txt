<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of aluminoxanes by addition of water to a solution of trialkylaluminium in an inert solvent, which is characterised in that the water necessary for the reaction is added via a mixing jet to a static mixer, in particular a jet loop reactor.
