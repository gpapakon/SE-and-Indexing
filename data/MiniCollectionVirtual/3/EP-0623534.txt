<ABSTRACT>
The device has, between a transport apparatus (10) with a transport plane (E) and a transport stage (15), two transport worms (1, 2) which can be driven in opposition and which are provided with an opposed pitch direction. The axes (7, 8) of the transport worms (1, 2) are arranged level with the transport plane (E), and the pitch (s) and flight width (w) of the continuous recesses (22) of the transport worms (1, 2) decrease continuously from the transport apparatus (10) towards the transport stage (15). Arranged between the two transport worms (1, 2) is a supporting surface (20) for the lid (D), which, at the end adjacent to the transport apparatus (10), is at the same level as the transport plane (E) and, at the end adjacent to the transport stage (15) is lower by half the lid diameter (d/2).

Device for changing the position of a lid (D) during 
transport from a flat position on a transport device 

(10) with a transport plane (E) into a steeply 
inclined position in a transport section (15), or vice 

versa, characterised in that the device has two 
transport worms (1, 2), which may be driven in 

contrary directions and are equipped with pitches in 
contrary directions;
 
that the axes (7, 8) of the transport worms (1, 2) are 

disposed at the height of the transport plane (E);
 
that at the end adjacent to the transport means (10) - 

viewed perpendicular to the transport plane (E) - the 
circumferential recesses (22) of the transport worms 

(1, 2) have a contour corresponding at least to the 
peripheral circle of the lid (D);
 
that the lead width (w) of the circumferential 

recesses (22) of the transport worms (1, 2) decreases 
from the end adjacent to the transport means (10) 

towards the end adjacent to the transport section 
(15);
 
and that a support surface (20) for the lid (D) is 

arranged between the transport worms (1, 2), said 
support surface having the same height at the end 

adjacent to the transport means (10) as the transport 
plane (E) and having a height which is lower by half 

the lid diameter (d/2) at the end adjacent to the 
transport section (15). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
pitch (s) of the transport worms (1, 2) decreases from 

the end adjacent to the transport means (10) towards 
the end adjacent to the transport section (15).  

 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that at the end adjacent to the transport section 

(15), the lead width (w) of the circumferential 
recesses (22) of the transport worms (1, 2) 

substantially corresponds to the height of the outer 
edge of the lid. 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that at the end of the transport worms (1, 2) adjacent 

to the transport section (15), the pitch (s) of said 
transport worms substantially corresponds to the stack 

height of a lid (D).
