<ABSTRACT>
A bag made of textile material, the two superimposed hollow textile layers of which are joined together at the sides and bottom of the bag by dobby fabric (6; 8) and at the top by strips (2) of dobby fabric, where the lateral dobby fabric (6) joining the front (10) and rear (11) of the bag extends from the dobby fabric (8) at the bottom at least as far as the top strips (2). Several such bags are arranged beside one another in a textile web, and the dobby fabric (6) joining the front (10) and rear (11) of the bag has a central selvedge (1) for separating the bags. The dobby fabric (8) closing the bag off at the bottom forms one continuous edge of the textile web and the top strips (2) form the other continuous open edge. In the process, a textile web for bags is produced on a power or automated loom with a dobby in a continuous production cycle with shaft threading in of three repeating groups.

Bag of textile material which is formed from a hollow
textile, the two superimposed textile layers of which

forming the front (10) and rear (11) of the bag are joined
together at the sides and at the bottom of the bag by dobby

fabric (6; 8) and at the top by edge strips (2) of dobby
fabric, characterized in that the laterally arranged dobby

fabric (6) connecting the front (10) and rear (11) of the
bag extends from the bottom dobby fabric (8) up to the edge

strips (2) so that the edge strips (2) are continous and
separate from each other.
Bag according to Claim 1, characterized in that hand
grip openings are arranged in the edge strips (2).
Bag according to Claim 1, characterized in that closure
strips are arranged or woven into the edge strips (2).
Bag according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that its front side (10) and rear side (11) consist of a

loose weave type textile and that the dobby fabric (6; 8)
connecting both of the textile layers laterally and at the

bottom as well as the dobby fabric forming the upper edge
strip (2) is o
f closer weave type.
Textile web for bags according to one of Claims 1 to 4
which comprises a double fabric which in the direction of

the warp threads at one edge has a dobby fabric (8)
connecting together both layers of the double fabric and

which is provided in the direction of the weft threads, in
each case at distances corresponding to the bag width, with

dobby fabric strips (7) connecting both layers of the
double fabric together and comprising selvedges (1),
 
characterized in that the double fabric of the textile web

at the other edge has in both layers edge strips (2) of
dobby fabric bordering in each case both of its layers and

that the selvedges (1) connecting both of the layers of the
double fabric extend from the continuous dobby fabric (8)

arranged at one edge at least up to the edge strip (2)
bordering in each case both layers of the double fabric and

provided at the other edge.
Textile web characterized in that it comprises two or
more textile webs according to Claim 5 of which one is

arranged in mirror image fashion to the neighbouring next
one.
Textile web according to Claim 6, characterized in that
selvedges running in its longitudinal direction are located

in the centre of neighbouring dobby fabric strips (8)
and/or edge strips (2) woven in one.
