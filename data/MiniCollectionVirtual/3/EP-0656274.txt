<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic circuit for controlling a 
plurality of hydraulic motors, said circuit comprising a reservoir for 

hydraulic fluid, a pump connected therewith and driven by an electric 
motor, as well as a valve device for controlling the hydraulic fluid 

flow to the various motors. According to the invention an OR-valve is 
connected in parallel to a reversible pump connected to the reservoir 

via a suction shuttle valve, the output of said OR-valve being 
connected to the fluid inlet of at least one electro-valve, wherein 

each electro-valve is hydrau-lically connected with one input of at 
least two AND-valves, the other input of which is connected with a 

pump outlet, whereas the outputs of the AND-valves constitute either 
individual or combined control outputs towards a hydraulic motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydraulic circuit for controlling a 
plurality of hydraulic motors, said circuit comprising a reservoir for 
hydraulic fluid, a reversible pump connected therewith and driven by an 
electric motor, as well as a valve device for controlling the hydraulic 
fluid-flow to the various motors. Such a hydraulic circuit is disclosed in EP-A-0 425 156. For the control of a plurality of hydraulic motors, in particular 
hydraulic piston cylinder devices, it has been usual to provide each 
piston cylinder device with a valve device adapted to be actuated 
according to a desired program. With a double acting piston cylinder 
device such valve device usually comprises two electro-valves, which may 
be ball seat valves of the 3/2 type. Such valves are especially designed 
for high pressures and leakage proof operation and are relatively 
expensive. In most cases, where a plurality of piston cylinder devices 
has to be controlled from a common hydraulic fluid source, this is not 
considered as a drawback, as in such cases relatively heavy piston 
cylinder devices are involved, which are expensive as such, whereas the 
pump pressures are generally not very high. In other cases such as with the hydraulic circuit disclosed in 
above mentioned EP-A-0 425 156, where relatively light weight piston 
cylinder devices have to be actuated in a desired sequence, however, the 
drawback connected with the electro-valves counts very heavily. For the 
limited space, which is usually available for accommodating the piston 
cylinder devices and the respective control unit, necessitates the use of 
extra high pump pressures. As an other example of such a case reference is made to NL-A-9200628 
(corresponding to EP-A-0 565 190). In this case three (pairs of) piston cylinder 
devices are applied, which have to be actuated in a certain sequence. In 
such a case one speaks of a hydraulic circuit with a plurality of (three) 
cylinder functions. In the latter circuit the actuation is usually 
effected by a pump having one direction of rotation, in cooperation with 
a control valve block, that comprises two electro-valves for each (double 
acting) cylinder function. In these cases the valves are very expensive in proportion to the 
relatively compact piston cylinder devices, and make a hydraulic device  
 
for opening and closing a foldable cover with a vehicle of the cabriolet-type 
very expensive and even more expensive in proportion to the number 
of cylinder functions to actuate. More generally separate
