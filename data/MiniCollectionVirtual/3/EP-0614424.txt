<ABSTRACT>
A control system (30) is provided for a vehicle (10) regulating engine speed during shifts so as to reduce driveline torque and shift shock. The control system (30) includes separate microprocessor based engine and transmission controllers (32, 34) which communicate via a data link. When a shift is initiated, the transmission controller (34) delays a period of time sufficient for the transmission (14) to disengage the old gear ratio and then produces a CTSSPEED signal. The transmission controller (34) continues to produce the CTSSPEED signal for a second period of time which corresponds to the time required for the transmission (14) to engage the new gear ratio. The engine controller (32) receives the desired engine speed signal (NOP) and regulates engine speed (NA) into correspondence with the desired speed. During upshifts, the CTSSPEED signal is set to a speed which is a predetermined amount above the synchronization speed of the new gear for an upshift. Conversely, during downshifts, the CTSSPEED is set to a speed which is a predetermined amount below the synchronization speed in the new gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
integrated engine and transmission controller and, 
more specifically, to a system which regulates engine 
speed during shifting to achieve improved shift 
characteristics. Traditional automatic transmission controls 
effect powershift gear changes in accordance with a 
preselected shift map, e.g. at specified ground 
speeds, even if the engine is at full speed and full 
throttle. Gear changes according to this method are 
inefficient and result in excessive wear to driveline 
components. More specifically, the transmission 
clutches are required to absorb the change in kinetic 
energy stored in the system and the energy generated 
by the engine during the gear changes. Additionally, 
such systems can exhibit excessive shift shock when 
the new gear is engaged due to the difference between 
the engine speed and the transmission speed in the new 
gear. In view of these problems, vehicle 
manufactures have developed control systems that are 
commonly referred to as integrated engine and 
transmission controllers. These systems function to 
reduce engine power during shifts to obtain 
satisfactory shift characteristics and increase the 
durability of the transmission clutches. Such systems 
generally reduce the engine speed during the shift by 
retarding ignition timing, reducing fuel injection or 
through a combination of both. Examples of integrated 
controllers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,266,447;  
 
4,355,550; 4,370,903; and 4,403,527. The subject invention is directed towards 
providing an integrated engine and transmission 
controller which exhibits superior performance with 
respect to known systems. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, a control system is provided for a vehicle 
having an engine connected to and adapted to drive an 
automatic transmission through a torque converter. 
The transmission includes a plurality of transmission 
gear ratios and an actuator automatically establishing 
a particular gear ratio in response to a transmission 
control signal. A transmission controller is adapted 
to sense at least one operating parameter and produce 
transmission control signals in response to the sensed 
parameter and in accordance with a predetermined shift 
map. The transmission controller is further adapted 
to produce a CTSSPEED signal during a change from an 
old gear ratio to a new gear ratio. The CTSSPEED 
signal corresponds to a speed which is a predetermined 
amount above the synchronization speed of the new gear 
for
