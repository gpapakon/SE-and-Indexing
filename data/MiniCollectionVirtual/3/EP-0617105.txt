Cold self-adhesive bitumen composition of the present
invention is characterised in that it comprises a mixture

composed of:

5% to 25% of a mixture of styrene-diene rubber
polymers comprising at least:


(A) one styrene-butadiene linear block copolymer
selected from coupled styrene-butadiene copolymers

with the general formula S-B-(c)-B-S, where S
represents the polystyrene segment, B the

polybutadiene segment, (c) the coupling agent, and
styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers without coupling

agent;
(B) one styrene-isoprene linear and/or radial
block copolymer;
(C) one styrene-diene double-block copolymer;
0% to 25% of one or more tackifying resins;
5% to 95% of bitumen.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that as
copolymer (A) a styrene-butadiene linear block copolymer is

used which has a styrene content of 28% to 77% by weight
and a total molecular weight in the range of between 70 000

and 160 000.
Composition according to either of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the copolymer (A) constitutes between

45% and 85% by weight of the polymer mixture and preferably
between 65% and 75% by weight of the polymer mixture.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that as
copolymer (B) a styrene-isoprene linear and/or radial block

copolymer is used, the styrene component of which 
constitutes from 10% to 40% by weight and preferably from

10% to 20%, and its total molecular weight lies in the
range of between 60 000 and 400 000, preferably between

100 000 and 150 000.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the copolymer (B) constitutes between

5% and 45% by weight of the polymer mixture and preferably
between 5% and 25% of the polymer mixture.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
copolymer used as (C) is a styrene-diene, preferably

styrene-butadiene, double-block copolymer, the styrene
component of which constitutes 15% to 45% by weight and

preferably from 20% to 35% by weight, and its total
molecular weight lies in the range of between 50 000 and

150 000, preferably between 50 000 and 100 000.
Composition according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
copolymer (C) is a statistical link copolymer, i.e. it

contains a statistically distributed styrene block and
styrene-butadiene block.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the copolymer (C) constitutes about

10% to 40% by weight of the polymer mixture and preferably
from 20% to 40% by weight.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the mixture of rubber polymers also

contains a styrene-butadiene radial block copolymer.
Sealing panels comprising at least one layer of a bitumen
composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 9.
