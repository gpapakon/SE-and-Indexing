<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to manufacture 
of composite materials. More particularly, this 
invention is directed to manufacture of superconducting 
wires. High temperature superconductors, that is, 
superconductors that have a critical temperature on the 
order of 90°K, are disclosed by Wu et al., Phys. Rev. 
Lett. 58, 908-910 (1987). These high temperature 
superconductors are based on the Y-Ba-Cu-O system. U.S. 
Patent 4,929,594 discloses a superconducting composition 
comprised of a crystalline phase of the formula 
Tl2Ba2CuO6+x, wherein x is from 0 to about 0.5, that has 
a temperature above 90°K. Subramanian et al., Science 
239, 1015-1017 (1988), disclose materials of the formula 
Bi2Sr3-xCaxCu2O8-y which show a resistivity drop at about 
116°K and apparent zero resistivity at 91°K. A wide variety of applications for superconducting 
materials has developed. These applications include 
power transmission and high-speed computer electronics. 
Superconductor materials have been used primarily in the 
form of sintered articles since elongated articles such 
as wire are difficult to form and have non-uniform 
properties. Known technologies of forming 
superconducting wire, as shown in U.S. Patent 4,980,964, 
employ powder-in-tube technology. This technology 
entails filling a metal tube with a powder of 
superconductive material, sealing the tube, and cold 
drawing the sealed metal tube until a predetermined wire 
size is achieved. The drawn wire is heat treated to  
 
assure crystallinity in the superconductor material. 
This technology, however, produces wire of short lengths 
and nonuniform properties. An improvement over powder-in-tube technology is 
described in European Patent Application publication 
number 0 292 385. This publication describes 
manufacturing an elongated superconducting composite by 
kneading a mixture of powder of superconducting oxide 
with a binder while shaping the resulting kneaded paste 
into an elongated pre-form by an extruder or other 
device. The pre-form is heated continuously to remove 
the binder. The pre-form then is wrapped with a 
metallic sheet and sintered at elevated temperatures. 
While this method results in longer and somewhat more 
uniform superconducting wire, this method can change the 
phase content of the resulting sintered ceramic and thus 
sacrifice superconducting properties. European Patent Application 306,034 shows a method 
of forming superconducting ceramics which have a metal 
cladding thereon. In an embodiment, preforms of plastic
