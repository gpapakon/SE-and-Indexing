<ABSTRACT>
A process for operating a folding machine with a plurality of successive folding units, at least one of which is fitted with a sheet detector in front of a sheet stop and with at least one, especially lateral, guide. Besides the automatic and single stroke operating systems, the machine is equipped with a further system. Here: the machine drive runs at reduced speed within a predetermined speed range; on detecting an incoming sheet, the fold detector sends a switch-off signal to the drive so that the sheet is braked before the guide of the folding unit concerned and comes to a halt; the sheet is then moved at further reduced speed against the sheet stop of the folding unit concerned; and, in the phase from the stopping of the sheet to its arrival at the stop, the guide is adjusted to the incoming sheet as required.

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a folder comprising a plurality of 
sequentially arranged folding units, of which at least one 

is provided with a sheet detector (26) arranged short of a 
sheet abutment (22) and at least one more particularly lateral 

guide (32, 34), in the case of which automatic and 
single stroke modes of operation are provided for, characterized 

by the provision of a further mode of operation for 
make-ready of the machine, in which: 


the drive of the machine is run at a reduced speed within 
a predetermined speed range, 
on detecting a supplied sheet (21) the sheet detector (26) 
supplies a switch off signal for the drive so that the sheet 

(21) is retarded short of the guide of the respective folder 
unit and comes to rest; 
the sheet is then moved at a further-reduced speed toward 
the sheet abutment (22) of the respective folder unit; and 
in a phase between a stationary state of the sheet (21) 
till the arrival thereof at the sheet abutment (22) the 

guide is set to suit the supplied sheet (21) as is required. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
movement of the sheet (21) toward the sheet abutment (22) is 

caused by manually powering the folder with a further-reduced 
speed.  

 
The method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
movement of the sheet (21) toward the sheet abutment (22) is 

caused at a further much-reduced speed by repeated, short-time 
operation of a switch for the temporary operation of 

the drive of the folder. 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least in certain folder units 

thereof a make-ready mode of operation is respectively individually 
provided for the single stroke mode of operation. 
The method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
after selection of the single stroke mode of operation the 

make-ready mode of operation is set, same involving the take 
up of a sheet (26) from a sheet delivery point by operation 

of a start-stop switch. 
The method as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
after setting of lateral guide means (32, 34) the drive of 

the folder is put into operation by actuating the start-stop 
switch and the sheet (26) is moved on at the said reduced 

speed from the sheet abutment (22) as far as the following 
folder unit. 
The method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the sheet (26) is arrested at the guide of the following 

folder unit for adjustment of the guide, if the single 
stroke operation mode has been selected for such folder 

unit. 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the folder comprises an inverter drive 

and an electronic control system. 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the folder possesses a predetermined 

speed range of approximately 50 to 60 m/min.
