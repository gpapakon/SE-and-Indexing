alkoxysilane, siloxane or silicone obtained from the group-free alkoxysilane 
and/or siloxane , to hydrolysis and polycondensation in the presence of a 

substantially neutral fluorine-containing compound. The functional group 
includes an epoxy group, a (meth)acryloxy group, a mercapto group and the 

like. Organopolysiloxanes having both a mercapto group and alkoxy group 
are novel ones.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing organic functional group-containing organopolysiloxanes
and also to organopolysiloxanes obtained by the process. The invention also relates to a process
for preparing organopolysiloxanes having a polymer moiety having specific types of recurring units. The invention
relates to a novel organopolysilaxane oligomer or polymer having both a mercapto functional group and an alkoxy group
and a process for preparing such a novel oligomer or polymer.A number of organic functional group-containing organopolysiloxane powder materials have been already
proposed including a process wherein tetraalkoxysilanes and organoalkoxysilanes are subjected to co-hydrolysis and
polycondensation reaction in the presence of ammonia serving as a catalyst as proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No.4-114065 and a process wherein the above co-hydrolysis and polycondensation reaction is conducted
in the presence of hydrofluoric acid (Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 62-166887 and Journal of the
Japanese Chemical Society 1983 (11), pp. 1577 to 1588).On the other hand, for the preparation of polysilsesquioxane, there are known a number of processes for
hydrolyzing and polycondensing alkoxysilanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane. In most cases, acids, bases or silanol
group-containing compounds are used as a catalyst for the hydrolysis and polycondensation. For instance, Japanese
Laid-open Patent Application No. 60-118715 proposes a process wherein hydrolysis is effected using an acid catalyst
and the resultant reaction system is rendered basic, followed by subsequent polycondensation. In Japanese Laid-open
Patent Application 61-854, a partially hydrolyzed condensate of trialkoxysilane is provided as a catalyst for hydrolysis
and polycondensation reaction.As is known in the art, however, the above-stated processes for preparing organic functional group-containing
organopolysiloxane powders have problems on (1) uniform dispersion or distribution of the organic functional group
in the fine pores of the polysiloxane product, (2) a highly reactive organic functional group being kept as it is during and
after the course of the hydrolysis and condensation, (3) porosity, and (4) working properties.With respect to the uniform dispersion or distribution (1), it is not possible to uniformly disperse or distribute
the organic functional group throughout the inside of the fine pore according to a dry process wherein a silane coupling
agent is sprayed over silicon dioxide powder.
