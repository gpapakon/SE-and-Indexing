<ABSTRACT>
Roofing panels are provided having a thermoplastic 
composite substrate and a weather-resistant outer film layer. The 

substrates have reinforcing fibers and a thermoplastic matrix 
material. The weather-resistant thermoplastic film layer is made 

from either an inherently weather-resistant thermoplastic material 
or from a thermoplastic material containing an effective amount of 

stabilizer compounds. The panels are relatively light weight and 
exhibit desired levels of resistance to weathering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to roofing panels, and more 
particularly relates to roofing panels shaped from composite sheets 
comprising a fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite substrate 
and a protective weather-resistant outer film layer. Aqueous methods of making fiber reinforced composite 
materials from an aqueous slurry of, solid polymer and reinforcing 
material are known. See Published European Patent Applications 
0,148,760 and 1,148,761, Wessling et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,426,470 
issued January 17, 1984 and Gatward et al., U.S. Patent No. 
3,716,449 issued February 13, 1973, all of which are incorporated 
herein by reference. In general these reinforced polymer 
composites have a uniform mixture of fiber, polymer and optionally 
binder and are prepared by forming dilute aqueous slurries of a 
solid heat-fusible organic polymer, a reinforcing material and 
optionally a latex binder. Roofing panels have been made and used from such 
composites. Such panels have the advantage of being light weight, 
large, easy to install, and can be shaped by a number of suitable 
shaping processes including matched molding and pressure 
forming. Such composites, however, can exhibit undesired 
degradation due to exposure to weathering elements such as heat, 
moisture and/or ultraviolet light. Accordingly, there is a need for roofing panels from 
thermoplastic composites which exhibit resistance to weathering.  This invention provides roofing panels shaped from 
composite sheets comprising (a) a thermoplastic composite 
substrate comprising (i) reinforcing fibers, preferably reinforcing 
inorganic fibers, and (ii) a thermoplastic matrix material; and (b) a 
weather-resistant thermoplastic outer cap film layer. The film layer 
is sufficiently thin to permit shaping of the sheet into the desired 
panel by forming processes, but has sufficient resistance to 
weathering to protect the composite from extended exposure to 
heat, moisture and ultraviolet light. The sheets can be shaped into a 
number of desired panel shapes including that of cedar shingles and 
ceramic tiles, are light weight, and may be of sufficient size to 
reduce installation costs. The roofing panel is shaped from a composite sheet having 
(a) a thermoplastic substrate comprising (i) reinforcing fibers, 
preferably reinforcing inorganic fibers, preferably having lengths of 
from 0.1 to 2.0 inches, wherein the fibers are preferably present in 
the substrate at a level of from 30% to 70% by weight based on the 
total weight of the substrate,
