<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement is disclosed for suppressing the combustion-caused vibrations in a gas turbine system combustion chamber (1) capable of vibrating acoustically. Said combustion chamber (1) has a burner (2) for burning a fuel-carrying fluid that may be supplied to the burner (2) through a supply line (3) capable of acoustically vibrating and acoustically coupled to the combustion chamber (1). In a first embodiment, the arrangement has an acoustically-active element (4, 5; 6; 7; 19) coupled to the supply line (3) that acoustically tunes-in the supply line (3) so that an unsteady combustion caused by acoustic vibrations in the supply line (3) is essentially excluded. In a second embodiment of the invention, the acoustic vibrations in the supply line (3) react by means of the acoustically-active element (4, 5; 6; 7; 19) on the acoustic vibrations in the combustion chamber (1). This feedback is conditioned by an unsteady combustion caused by the acoustic vibrations in the supply line (3) and is set in such a manner that it counteracts the generation of combustion-caused vibrations. The invention may be advantageously used in stationary gas turbine systems with 100 MW and higher electric rated power.
