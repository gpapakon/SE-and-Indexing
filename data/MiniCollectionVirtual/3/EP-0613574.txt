<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structure of 
digital circuits which add binary data bits; and more particularly, 
it relates to the structure of such adder 
circuits which operate at high speed. In the prior art, digital adder circuits have 
been widely used. For example, they are used in the 
arithmetic units of general purpose digital computers, and 
they are also used in special purpose arithmetic modules 
such as a multiplier. In many of these applications, the 
speed at which the adder circuit operates is of critical 
importance. Conventionally, digital adder circuits have been 
structured entirely of digital logic gates such as AND 
gates, NOR gates, EXCLUSIVE-OR gates, etc. One such adder 
circuit, for example, is the SN54HC283 which is sold by 
Texas Instruments. A logic diagram of that adder circuit 
is disclosed at page 2-364 of the "High-Speed CMOS Logic 
Data Book" from Texas Instruments, copyrighted 1987. A problem, however, with an adder that is implemented 
entirely of logic gates is that the signal path from 
the carry-in terminal for the least significant data bits,  
 
to the carry-out terminal from the most significant data 
bits, goes through several logic gates in a series. Each 
logic gate imposes a certain time delay on the signal path, 
and thus the speed for generating the carry-out signal from 
the most significant data bits is limited by the serial 
gating. Another structure in the prior art for a digital 
adder which avoids the above problem is disclosed in a 
technical paper entitled "High-Speed CMOS adder and Multiplier 
Modules for Digital Signal Processing in a Semicustom 
Environment" by Kershof et al, IEEE Journal of solid-state 
circuits, Vol. 24, No. 3, Line 1989, pages 570-575. In 
this paper, Fig. 5 shows a circuit diagram of a digital 
adder in which the signal path from the carry-in signal for 
the least significant bits, to the carry-out terminal from 
the most significant bits, goes through one input inverter 
and the channels of several transistors and one output 
inverter. A separate transistor channel is included for 
each pair of data bits being added. This adder circuit 
avoids the time delay through a serial string of logic 
gates by replacing it with a shorter time delay through a 
serial string of transistor channels. Still another structure, in the prior art, of a 
digital adder which is a variation on the Kershof et al 
adder is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,025,409 by Gotto issued 
June 18, 1991. Various embodiments of the Gotto adder are 
shown in his
