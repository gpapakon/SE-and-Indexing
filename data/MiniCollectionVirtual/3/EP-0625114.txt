<ABSTRACT>
A pouch (20) for storing and dispensing liquid product in incremental amouts having a body portion (26) and a pump tube portion (28), wherein the pouch (20) can be held within a dispensing apparatus for squeezing the pump tube portion (28) to release the incremental amounts. The improved pouch (20) provides a pump tube portion (28) made of thermoplastic polypropylene and butyl terpolymer rubber which can be readily sealed to the body without fitments or couplers. The improved pouch (20) provides a built-in "duck bill" check valve assembly (112) or alternatively an O-ring check valve assembly (44), which further reduces the number of parts required as compared to the prior art. The check valve assembly provides a socket connector (114) for mounting a separate nozzle assembly (118) to the check valve assembly. A break-off tab (158) for initially opening the nozzle assembly for dispensing is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a device for holding a
liquid product and having a pump tube for dispensing incremental
amounts of the product from the device. In particular, the invention
relates to a pouch having a pump tube extending from the bottom of the
pouch, the pouch and pump tube being installable into a mechanical
dispenser which selectively squeezes the pump tube to dispense
predetermined incremental amounts of the liquid held within the pouch.The invention is particularly adapted to hold liquid soap to be
installed into a self-dispensing mechanism wherein activation of a push
bar or the like dispenses a predetermined amount of liquid soap out of a
nozzle arranged at a bottom end of the pump tube. A mechanism for
holding the pouch and tube is disclosed in US-A-5242083.A number of prior art devices are known to holding liquids that
include elongate cylindrical portions extending therefrom for squeezing
by a dispensing mechanism. Such devices are illustrated in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,349,133, 4,463,876, 4,546,904, 4,667,854 and 4,932,562.In a typical structure, a pouch is provided having a pump tube
extending therefrom. A check valve is usually located at a lower end of
the pump tube. The check valve comprises four pieces, an upper cap
having a valve orifice, a lower cap having a through aperture and a ball
fittable over said orifice, and a spring for biasing the ball against said 
orifice. When the pump tube pressure overcomes the force of the
spring, fluid passes through the orifice and out of the aperture.The check valve is designed to prevent fluid from leaking or
dripping from the pump tube. Known check valve structures are not
entirely satisfactory due to their complicated structure that makes
manufacturing same time consuming. Additionally, the structure in
combination with known pump tubes does not always prevent dripping.An additional problem with known pouch and tube constructions is
that the tube cannot be directly sealed to the pouch. Instead, it is
necessary to use a coupler to seal the tube to the pouch.There is therefore a need for an improved pump tube and pouch
construction.The features of the present invention are disclosed in Claim 1, of
which the precharacterising part is based on US-A-4546904, referred to
above. An advantage of the present invention is that it provides an
improved pouch and pump tube structure, in which the
pump tube does not require a four piece check valve structure.Additional features and advantages of the present invention are
described in, and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pouch for holding and dispensing incremental amounts of liquid,
comprising a body section (26) for holding a supply of liquid; a pump tube

(28) arranged to be squeezed by a dispensing device for passing
the incremental amounts of liquid therefrom, the pump tube having a tube

section (34) flow connected to said body section (26), and a check
valve (30,44) flow connected to the tube section (34), the

check valve including a check valve section (44) formed integrally
with the tube section and having an aperture (50), the check valve

section walls being biased so as normally to close the aperture, which is
openable by peristaltic pressure caused by the squeezing of the pump tube,

and a nozzle section (30) terminating in an outlet aperture (72),

said nozzle section (30) and said check valve section (40) having
interengaging means (64) therebetween for connecting the nozzle

section to the check valve section, characterised by a resilient O-ring (60)
surrounding the check valve section (44).
The pouch of Claim 1, wherein the aperture of the nozzle
section is covered by a cap having a finger tab portion

extending therefrom, the cap being connected to the nozzle by a frangible
joint and the finger tab portion being arranged and adapted to

facilitate breaking of the frangible joint to open said nozzle outlet aperture .
The pouch of any preceding claim, wherein the tube (28)
comprises a thicker material than the body section (26), the tube retaining

resilient structural memory after being squeezed. 
The pouch of Claim 3, wherein the tube section (28)
comprises a flange (40) pressed against a bottom of said body section,

and the body section comprises a film nozzle portion (36) extending into
the tube section (34) and sealed to an inside surface of the tube section.
The pouch according to any preceding claim, wherein the tube
(28) is constructed from a composition containing a butyl

terpolymer rubber and polypropylene.
The pouch of Claim 5, wherein the composition consists essentially
of 20 to 45 parts by weight of thermoplastic polypropylene and 80 to 55

parts by weight of butyl terpolymer rubber.
The pouch of Claim 6, wherein the composition includes 5 to 60
parts by weight of oil and 2 to 20 parts by weight of a reinforcing filler.
