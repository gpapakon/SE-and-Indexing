An apparatus and method for drying a wet sheet material 
such as a paper web is presented. The apparatus is provided 

with a suitable number of dryer cylinders operating in 
conjunction with a plurality of steam blast ports disposed 

adjacent to the dryer cylinders. A vertically movable canopy 
hood and a middle hood having sheet entry/exit opening and a 

door opening device are provided. The wet sheet material is 
held between two endless fabric belt, and passed through the 

dryer cylinders alternatively by means of suction fabric rolls, 
fabric rolls and fabric tension rolls. The drying process is 

carried out in an atmosphere of superheated steam of over 100°C 
inside the canopy hood and the middle hood, and the steam 

generated from the wet sheets is recirculated through an exhaust 
screen, a super heated steam circulating fan, an adiabatic 

compressor and a supply duct. Another atmosphere of heated 
moist air having a dew point of at least 80°C is also employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a novel process
and apparatus for drying sheet materials, such as paper and some
of wet process-nonwoven fabric, which are susceptible to
breakage in the wet conditions as opposed to woven fabric, and
which are subjected to intra-fibre contraction due to the
formation of inter-fibre hydro-bonding caused by vaporization of
moisture during drying process.A typical method for drying a paper web on a paper-making
machine generally involves steam-heated dryer cylinders. In
recent years, a closed dryer hood insulated by suitable
insulating materials is installed so as to surround dryer
cylinders in series. A large volume of high temperature, low
humidity air (heated with exhaust steam and fresh stream) is
blown into the dryer hood, and the moisture released from the
paper web is removed in a moving air stream kept at no greater
than 70-80% saturation curve to prevent condensation inside the
hood. However, the technique is energy-intensive because of the
blowers needed to handle a large amount of process air, and is
wasteful of energy also because the moisture-laden air is
largely exhausted to the atmosphere except for a minor use as
reheating of fresh air supply.Another technique developed in recent years involves the
use of two heated and cooled endless steel belts holding a wet
paper web therebetween. The moisture vaporized by the heated 
belt is immediately condensed on the cooled belt, and the
condensate is drained onto an endless fabric belt. Thus, the
wet paper web is dried at a temperature in excess of 100°C while
restraining the expansion/contraction thereof. The paper dried
by this technique is of high quality, but the technique requires
a large quantity of cooling water, which can only be recycled as
warm water. Therefore, the process economy is quite inferior.For drying of thin papers, such as toilet and tissue
papers, a wet web of paper is dried on a single large-diameter
dryer cylinder, called a Yankee dryer, which has a canopy hood
disposed so as to surround a top half portion of the cylinder.
Fresh air and recycled moisture-laden air are heated to a high-temperature
gas at about 300-450°C, and are blown towards the
exposed side of the wet paper web at a high speed of 70-120 m/s.
The product has a Yankee glazed surface on one side only, and
the other side remains rough. The use of manufactured product
is therefore limited somewhat to such uses as a wrapping paper
with one glazed side and a tissue paper.Yet another drying technique proposed is based on
