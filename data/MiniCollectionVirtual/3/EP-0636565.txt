<ABSTRACT>
A bobbin holder mounted on a yarn winding machine which 
bobbin holder comprises a plurality of chucking members 

(12A-12L) disposed at an outer periphery of a holder (3), 
the chucking members being expanded radially outwardly so as 

to chuck an inner side of a cylindrical bobbin coaxially 
inserted onto the holder when they are longitudinally 

compressed and the chucking members releasing the bobbin 
when they are moved radially inwardly, portions on the 

holder for disposing the chucking members are formed in a 
concave (3a-3l), a part of the chucking members is inserted 

into the concave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bobbin holder onto 
which a cylindrical bobbin is inserted and held thereby, 
which bobbin holder is mounted on a winding machine wherein 
a yarn is wound onto the bobbin. The bobbin holder of the 
present invention is especially suitable for a winding 
machine for winding a spun synthetic yarn such as a 
polyester or polyamide yarn at a speed, for example, of 
several thousands m/min. Recently, there is a tendency in a yarn winding 
apparatus that the diameter of a bobbin is reduced. 
Accordingly, the diameter of a bobbin holder is also 
reduced, and at the same time the length of the bobbin 
holder becomes long as its winding speed increases. 
Recently developed bobbin holders mounted on such a winding 
machine are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility 
Model Applications Laid-open No. Sho 60-43667 and No. Sho 
60-1766 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Sho 
55-123847. Since a chucking member is inserted onto an outside of 
a supporting shaft or a holder in such conventional bobbin 
holders, the outer diameter of the shaft or the holder is 
equal to a size which is obtained from an inner diameter of 
the bobbin after the necessary size for the chucking member 
is excluded. Therefore, the outer diameter of the shaft or 
the holder becomes small. Thus, the rigidity of the shaft 
or the holder is lowered, and natural vibration of the 
bobbin holder occurs in the operational range of the bobbin  
 
holder. Accordingly, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the vibration 
becomes large at the operational range above 10,000 rpm. As a 
result, there is a problem in that the bobbin holder cannot be 
rotated in such a high operational range. Accordingly, the 
winding machine cannot be operated at a high speed. DE-A-30 44 315 discloses a bobbin holder as set out in the 
preamble of claim 1. Said bobbin holder comprises a cylindrical 
sleeve slideably supported on a supporting shaft of the bobbin 
holder. The sleeve is provided with concaves and a part of each 
chucking member is received within the respective concave. For 
expanding the chucking members radially outwardly or for moving 
the chucking members radially inwardly, said sleeve is 
displaced axially on the supporting shaft. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
bobbin holder which can have a small diameter and a long length 
and which at the same time shows a reduced tendency to develop 
vibration so that said bobbin holder can be operated at a high 
speed. According to the present invention,

<CLAIMS>
A bobbin holder for mounting on a yarn winding machine, 
which bobbin holder comprises a supporting shaft (1), a 

plurality of chucking members (12A - 12L) disposed at an outer 
periphery of the supporting shaft (1), said chucking members 

(12A - 12L) being adapted to expand radially outwardly upon 
being compressed longitudinally so as to chuck an inner side 

of a cylindrical bobbin (22) coaxially inserted onto the 
supporting shaft (1), and to move radially inwardly so as to 

release said bobbin (22), wherein concaves (3a - 3l) are 

provided around the supporting shaft (1) with a part of said 
chucking members (12A - 12L) being received into said concaves 

(3a - 3l),
 
characterized in that
 
said concaves (3a - 3l) are either formed on the supporting 

shaft (1) itself or on a cylindrical holder (3) mounted 
directly onto the supporting shaft (1) and secured in an 

axially non-displaceable manner with regard to the supporting 
shaft.  

 
A bobbin holder according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


said holder (3) further comprises, at the outer surface 
thereof, channels (3m) formed at portions axially adjacent to 

the concaves (3a - 3l), and 
said chucking members (12A - 12L) have hooks (13c) engaging 
said channels (3m). 
A bobbin holder according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a plurality of said concaves (3a - 3l), 

each of which extends in a circular periphery of said 
supporting shaft (1), are spaced in an axial direction of said 

supporting shaft (1).  
 
A bobbin holder according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that said chucking members (12A - 12L) are 

caused to expand radially outwardly or to move radially 
inwardly by means of sleeves (10A - 10L) that are inserted onto 

the holder (3) or the supporting shaft (1) and that are axially 
displaceable with regard to the holder (3) or the supporting 

shaft (1), respectively.
