<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a sign display assembly for a 
gondola-type shelving arrangement (10). The display sys-tem 

includes a bracket (18) and a support arm assembly (26, 28) 
to which the sign (14) is connected. The support arm 

assembly includes telescoping support arms (26, 28) and a 
support clip (30). The support clip includes projections 

(68) for securing the support clip to the support arms and 
flanges (72, 74) that are placed in track means (17, 19) 

found on the back of the sign to interengage the sign with 
the support assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to display systems, and 
particularly to display assemblies that can be mounted 
above a gondola system. Such systems are designed to 
provide for the insertion of various types of 
advertising and descriptive materials, such as, product 
illustrations, endorsements, pricing schedules, and 
other types of information that will be helpful in 
promoting the sale of the products located on the 
shelving system disposed adjacent thereto. While the utilization of product display 
systems is well known in the point-of-purchase display 
industry, there has not been the ready availability of 
systems that are relatively low in cost, flexible in 
design and can be readily assembled and disassembled 
relative to the shelving to which it is to be connected 
in an expeditious and efficient manner. Heretofore, it 
has not been possible to readily vary the orientation of 
the signage, which may have a significant impact with 
respect to the products being disposed for sale 
therebelow. Specifically, it has long been desirable to 
provide for signage that can be readily located in a 
vertical or angled position, which positioning can be 
adjusted to maximize the effectiveness of the display. 
Such systems that have heretofore been utilized have not 
been particularly attractive and do not lend themselves 
readily for location on more than one side of the 
shelving system with which it is to be employed. There 
has been a long-felt need in the point-of-purchase 
display industry to provide a system that can be readily 
connected to conventional gondola-type shelving that can 
be positioned relative to such shelving in a vertical or 
angled position.  The system for carrying various types of 
point-of-purchase display devices should be quickly and 
easily adaptable to conventional gondola-type standards. 
The system should be sufficiently versatile to support 
the display area throughout the length of the gondola 
and to accomplish this, it is necessary that the display 
system be supported at various points along the 
transverse location of the display by very simple 
mechanisms which can be readily interchanged, depending 
on the orientation of the display system that is 
desired. In accordance with the present invention, 
there is provided a system that can be mounted directly 
to a standard or spaced therefrom by one or a pair of 
telescoping support arms that are connected at one end 
through a bracket to a standard of a gondola system and 
its other end to a support clip to which the sign

<CLAIMS>
A sign display system for a shelving structure 
(10; 200) comprising a sign support assembly (16) adapted 

to be connected to the shelving structure, said support assembly 
being characterized by a bracket (18) constructed 

and arranged to be connected to the shelving structure 
(10), a support arm (26, 28), means (44, 46) interconnecting 

said bracket to one end of said support arm, a support 
clip (30) for receiving a sign (14), means (68, 70) interconnecting 

said support clip and the other end of said support 
arm, said support clip (30) and sign (14) defining interengaging 

means (72, 74, 76, 78) for connecting the sign 
to the support clip for supporting the sign (14) relative 

to said support assembly (16). 
A sign display system as set forth in claim 1 in 
which the support clip (30) includes an angled face (56) 

and a vertical face (54) whereby the sign (14) supported 
thereby can be disposed normal to its support assembly (16) 

or at an angled relationship with respect thereto. 
A sign display system as set forth in claim 1 in 
which the support clip (30) defines a plurality of slots 

(58, 60, 62) and the support arm (28) fits into one of said 
slots, and the means for interconnecting the support clip 

to the support arm includes a member (68) secured to said 
clip that is positioned within said slot to engage an opening 

(70) defined by said support arm. 
A sign display system as set forth in claim 3 in 
which the member within said slot (58, 60, 62) positioned 

to engage an opening (70) in said support arm (28) comprises 
a T-shaped connector (64) that defines a projection 

(68) shaped to fit into the opening (70) in the support 
arm, which projection defines a camming surface (69) that 

is engaged by said support arm (28) as it extends into said 
opening (70) to move it away from said support member until 

it is aligned with said opening therein. 
A sign display system for a shelving structure 
(10; 200) comprising a sign support assembly (16) adapted 

 
to be connected to the shelving structure, said support assembly 

being characterized by a bracket (18) constructed 
and arranged to be connected to the shelving structure 

(10), a pair of telescoping support arms (26, 28), means

said support arms, a support clip (30) for receiving a sign 
(14), means (68, 70) interco
nnecting said support clip and 
the other end of the other of said support arms, whereby 

the distance between the shelf system (10) and the support 
clip (30) can be varied as desired, said support clip (30)
