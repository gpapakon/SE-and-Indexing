<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a hot drinks machine, especially a coffee machine, comprising at least one hot water outlet (8) situated over a filter holder (5), a plate (10) for distributing the hot water over the surface of the powder contained in the filter holder, said plate (10) being provided with perforations (22, 22', 22b, 23, 24, 28a, 28b) and being connected to means (20) for controlling the radial distribution of water, the machine being characterised in that:   - the plate (10) comprises a series of individual sectors (15, 15') defined by walls (16, 16') rising from the upper surface of the plate (10), within which sectors are the perforations (22, 22', 22b, 23, 24, 28a, 28b); - the plate (10) and the water outlet are fitted in such a way as to allow for relative mobility in order that, by means of the control means (20), the relative position (P1 to P6) of the water outlet (8) above the individual sectors (15, 15') can be adjusted and selected, or vice versa.

<CLAIMS>
A hot-beverage machine, in particular a coffee machine, including
at least one hot water outlet (8, 8') disposed above a filter-holder

(5), a hot-water distribution plate (10, 10') including a series of
individual sectors (15, 15') which are defined by walls (16, 16')

standing on the top face (17) of the plate (10, 10'), and within
which perforations (22, 22', 22b, 23, 24, 28a, 28b) are formed, the

plate (10, 10') and the water outlet (8, 8') being mounted so as to
be relatively movable to enable the relative position of the water

outlet (8, 8') above the individual sectors (15, 15') to be adjusted
and selected, or vice-versa, each individual sector (15, 15')

including at least one perforation (22, 22', 22b, 23, 24, 28a, 28b)
occupying, relative to the axis of symmetry (x-x') of the filter-holder

(5), a radial position characteristic of said sector, said
position being different from the characteristic radial position of

every other sector, the distribution plate (10, 10') being situated
facing the filter-holder, the perforation(s) corresponding to a given

sector (15, 15') being positioned so as to act on the distribution of
hot water for a selected relative position, so as to modify the

distribution of the hot water dispensed onto the surface of the
grounds contained in the filter-holder (5).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that each sector
(15, 15') includes at least one surface portion which may be

positioned in register with the water outlet(s) (8, 8').
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that the plate
(10, 10') is constituted by a disk which is movably mounted to rotate

about its axis of symmetry so that a selected sector (15, 15') can be
positioned in register with at least one water outlet (8, 8').
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that the plate
(10, 10') is constituted by a fixed disk, and in that the water

outlet(s) (8, 8') is/are movably mounted so that it/they can be
positioned above each individual sector (15, 15') that has been

selected. 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the closer the perforation is to the center of the plate (10,

10'), the greater the area of the perforations (22, 22', 22b, 23, 24,
28a, 28b).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the individual sectors (15, 15') form a series of sectors which

are essentially radial and adjacent to one another.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that one of the sectors is associated with a duct opening out to the

outside of the filter-holder to deliver the hot water which has not
passed through the grounds.
A machine according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that it

preferably includes three identical series (S1, S2, S3) of radial
sectors (15, 15') offset by 120Â°, each series (S1, S2, S3) including:


a first radial sector (15a) which is defined by two radial
walls (16a, 16b) which open out to the central zone (30) of the plate

(10) via an opening, and which are connected together at a distance
from the periphery of the plate (10) by a peripheral wall (16c), said

first sector (15a) being associated with at least one and preferably
two perforations (22) situated in the vicinity of the central zone

(30);
a second radial sector (15b) which is adjacent to the first
radial sector (15a) and which is of identical shape, said second

sector being connected to the central zone (30) via an opening, and
being provided with a central perforation (22b) ;
a third radial sector (15c) which is closed and adjacent to the
second radial sector (15b), and which is outwardly defined by a

peripheral wall (16c) which is an extension of that of the second
sector (15b), said third sector including a perforation (23) situated

at the same level as the central perforation (22b);
a fourth radial sector (15d) which is adjacent to the third
sector (15c) and which is of identical shape and size to that of the

third sector (15c), and which includes two perforations (24), one
being situated on the same circle as the perforation 23, and the 

other being situated in the vicinity of the peripheral wall (16c)
which defines the top portion of said fourth sector (15d);
a fifth radial sector (15e) which is adjacent to the fourth
sector (15d) and which extends radially outwards beyond the

peripheral wall (16c) via a second peripheral wall (26) which defines
an annular sector (27) which terminates at the level of the second

radial sector (15b) and is provided with two perforations (28a, 28b);
and
a sixth radial sector (15f) which is adjacent to the fifth
sector (15e) and which also includes an annular peripheral sector

(29) in which a perforation (35) is formed.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, or 7,
characterized in that it includes a plate (10') having a

substantially circular central sector (52) provided with three
perforations (22), an intermediate sector (54) surrounding, at least

in part, the central sector (52) and provided with three perforations
(22), an outside sector (55) surrounding the intermediate sector (54)

and provided with three perforations (22), and a radial channel (57)
extending to the central sector (52) and exceeding the periphery of

presenting at least one zone extending into a common annular sector

(58) which is situated in register with the water outlet (8').
