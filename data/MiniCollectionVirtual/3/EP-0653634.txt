<ABSTRACT>
Gaseous bubbles are made to rise in two respective
measuring columns (30,20) for purified reference water

and for the water to be examined, which columns are
supplied with descending currents and drained by

respective ascending discharge columns (34,24) and
overflows (36,26); the bubbles are measured with a

konimeter on the rising sections, and the difference in
rising times in the two columns is calculated, in order

to determine the extent of the presence of surfactants.

<DESCRIPTION>
A gaseous bubble in water tends to rise to the 
surface owing to fluid pressure; in pure water, its 
speed of rising depends on various factors, because of 
the complex dynamics which occur on the surface of the 
bubble. As the bubble rises, its outer surface is 
subjected to stress caused by the forces of sliding 
friction of the external fluid. The outer layer of the 
bubble transmits part of the motion of the external 
fluid to the gas contained in the bubble, inducing 
motion in the gas; this phenomenon means that sliding 
friction during rising is considerably reduced, and the 
bubble rises in pure water at a speed which is far 
higher than would be the case if it were a body of the 
same dimensions and density, but with a rigid surface 
structure characteristic of solids. If the gaseous bubble moves in water which 
contains surfactant substances, other phenomena, which 
change its speed considerably, intervene. Owing to 
their structural features, these substances have the 
property of distributing themselves spontaneously at 
the water/air interphase in concentrations which are 
far higher than those which occur in the mass of the 
water, giving rise to the formation of an adsorption 
film which is generally monomolecular (i.e. of the 
thickness of one molecule of the substance adsorbed). 
In the case of rising gaseous bubbles, adsorption of a 
surfactant substance on the surface of the bubble gives 
rise to a film which, depending on the mass 
concentration of the rising path and the surface 
activity of the product, enriches the surface of the 
bubble of surfactant molecules such as to confer 
rigidity on the surface of the bubble. The transmission 
of quantities of motion to the gases (or most commonly 
to the fluid contained in the bubble) is prevented in 
this case, and friction on the surface of the bubble  
 
increases as the surface concentration increases, until 
that of a typical solid structure is obtained. In other 
words, by adsorbing the surfactant material on its 
surface, the bubble acquires the same features as a 
solid body, and therefore follows Stokes' law, which 
governs the motion of a solid sphere which is left free 
to move in a fluid of a different density. By measuring the decrease in speed of rising of a 
bubble in aqueous means, the above-described phenomena 
as a whole permit detection of the presence of 
surfactants, even in the form of traces. In fact, the 
phenomenon of adsorption can increase up to thousands 
of times the difference of concentration between the 
su

1) A device for measuring the quantity of 
surfactant substances in water by calculating the speed 

of rising of gaseous bubbles in a water column to be 
examined, which comprises in association: two

20) for pure reference water and for the water to be 

examined, with respective systems (46,32A,22A) for 
generating gas bubbles; means (30A,20A) for supplying 

the two types of water from the top into the two 
columns (30,20) and for creating descending currents 

therein; discharge columns (34,24) which extend from 
the lower area (30B,20B) of the measuring columns 

(30,20) and which form overflows (36,26) at the top, in 
which discharge columns rising currents are formed 

downstream of the measuring columns, in order to ensure 
that the level in the two measuring columns remains 

constant.

said circuit is divided into a first circuit

containing its own pump (9,14) which has the same
