<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic head preferably adapted 
for being loaded in a recording and/or reproducing apparatus, 
such as, a video tape recorder (VTR) or a data storage. As a magnetic head employed in a 8-mm VTR, a magnetic head, 
as shown in Fig.1, has been proposed in which a pair of magnetic 
core substrates 103, 104 having gap films 101, 102 formed thereon 
by sputtering are abutted to each other on the gap films 101, 102 
as abutment surfaces and are bonded to each other to be 
integrated into one unit by a fused glass 105, with the abutment 
surfaces forming a magnetic gap functioning as a 
recording/reproduction gap. Normally, the magnetic head of such structure employs a soft 
magnetic oxide material, such as Mn-Zn ferrite or Ni-Zn ferrite 
for the magnetic core substrates 103, 104. On the other hand, 
the magnetic head employs an oxide non-magnetic material, such 
as SiO₂, for the gap films 101, 102. Meanwhile, since SiO₂ is quartz having a coefficient of 
thermal expansion nearly equal to zero, a residual stress is 
generated to the ferrite in the heating and cooling processes 
required for glass fusion. Also, since SiO₂ tends to apply a 
stress to the magnetic core substrates 103, 104 in sputtering 
formation, the stress lowers magnetic permeability and soft  
 
magnetic property of the ferrite portion on which a film of SiO₂ 
is to be formed. As a result, efficiency of the magnetic cores 
is lowered. In addition, as SiO₂ is contained in the fused glass 105, 
erosion of the gap films 101, 102 occurs in the fusion process, 
causing the glass to contact the ferrite, as shown in Fig.2. The 
contact of the glass with the ferrite is also caused by 
structural defects, that is, a large molecular structure with 
SiO₂ as an oxide and a rough structure of the film. The contact of the glass with the ferrite causes atomic 
movement on the boundary face, and subsequent elution of ferrite 
components into the glass causes slight magnetization of the 
glass. Thus, a magnetic flux between the cores is more likely 
to pass through the magnetized glass in the gap and a glass part 
106 near a track width restriction groove. As a result, an 
originally required magnetic flux from the magnetic gap to a 
medium is weakened. At the end of the magnetic gap, the structure of SiO₂ tends 
to be rough and chemical potential on the surface rises, causing 
erosion of SiO₂. As a result, the ferrite is eluted and then 
precipitates again in the cooling process occur. Thus, the 
ferrite may appear to be
