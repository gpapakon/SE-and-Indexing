<ABSTRACT>
A rigid disk drive information storage device (1, 4) includes a rigid disk (10) having an outside diameter of about 33-34 mm, with a housing having a footprint with a width of about 35 mm and utilizing a rotary actuator (15) for positioning read/write recording elements (5) across the surface of the disk (10). The disk storage devices (1, 4) includes a footprint with length of about 50.8 mm, and includes in one embodiment dynamic head loading apparatus for loading the read/write recording elements (5) into operative relationship with the disk (10). In another embodiment the rigid disk drive (1, 4) utilizes contact start stop loading and unloading of the read/write recording elements (5). An inertial latch (16) prevents rotation of the actuator (15) when the drive (1, 4) is subjected to a rotational force. Back electromotive force generated by spin motor windings is used during power down to unload the read/write recording elements (5) from the disk surface and latch the actuator (15) in parked position.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MICROMINIATURE HARD DISK DRIVEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 10 Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to rigid disk drives, and more particularly to rigid disk drives for pocket, palm-top, and laptop computers.Description of Prior Art15 The continuing trend toward smaller portable computers has created the need for a new class of miniature information storage devices. Portable applications for information storage devices have resulted in increasingly severe environmental and physical20 requirements. Small size, low power consumption, environmental endurance, low cost and light weight are characteristics that must co-exist in these applications; they cannot be met by simple extensions of previous technology.25 Many examples of miniaturized reduced "footprint" disk drives have been described in patents such as U.S. Patent 4,568,988 to McGinley, et al, issued February 4, 1986, Reexa ination Certificate (953rd), United States Patent B14,568,988, certificate issued November 29, 1988,30 United States Patent 4,933,785, issued June 12, 1990 to Morehouse, et al. The rigid magnetic recording disk utilized in the device, described in McGinley, et al., had a diameter of approximately 3.5 inches. In the Morehouse, et al. device described in that patent, the rigid disks35 utilized in the drive had a nominal diameter of 2.5 inches. The "footprint" (width by length measurement) of the drive described in the above-noted Morehouse, et al. 

 patent was described as being 2.8 inches by 4.3 inches. That is, the housing used to enclose the rigid disk drive was 2.8 inches wide and 4.3 inches long. A rigid disk drive of that size is generally applicable to computers having a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches by 1 inch.Another patent describing a relatively small diameter disk was issued June 18, 1991 to Stefansky, U.S. Patent 5,025,335. Stefansky describes a 2-1/2" form factor disk drive utilizing a single rigid disk having a diameter of approximately 2.6 inches. However, these products do not provide the combination of features needed for "pocket," "palm-top" and laptop computers.History has shown that as disk drives become smaller and more efficient, new applications and uses for disk storage become practical. For example, using the disk drive as a circuit board assembly component requires further reduction in the physical size of the storage device as well as unique mounting strategies, issues addressed by this invention. Use of disk drive storage devices in palm-top computers and small electronic devices,
