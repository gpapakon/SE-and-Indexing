 in which the radical R represents C1-C30-alkyl, C2-C30-alkenyl and C2-C30-alkynyl, from carboxylic acids of the general formula II 
<

 independently of one another denote C1-C3-alkyl or together denote a C4- or C5-alkylene chain which can optionally be interrupted by an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom having attached to it a C1-C4-alkyl group or a formyl group, and n denotes an integer from 0 to 2, by   a) loading a formamide of the formula IV with 0.1 to 100 mol% of phosgene and subsequently b) reacting the resulting catalyst addition product with a carboxylic acid of the formula II.
