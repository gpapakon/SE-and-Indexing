<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image reproducing
device for reading an image from a recording medium and
reproducing it upon each reception of reproduction request.An image reproducing device is preferably installed at a
post production studio where edited images are stored in a
hard disk or the like, while reproduced images are stored in
tapes to be distributed to users such as a broadcasting
station.Such image reproducing device stores images into recording
medium; however, recording medium is frequently damaged during
transportation or storage. A partial image recorded in damaged
part of recording medium cannot be reproduced; therefore,
successive image reproduction is annoyed by unavoidable damage
on recording medium.This problem is described with a conventional image
reproducing device.FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting the configuration of
a conventional image reproducing device.FIG. 2 shows an example of image recording medium which
stores image information. The image recording medium in FIG. 
2 includes image frames A, B, C, D, E, and F in which the frame
D includes a faulty sector expressed by slash lines.FIG. 3 shows an example of edit information stored in an
edit information storing unit 1501. The edit information
storing unit 1501 stores frame identifier, frame, and start
address and end address indicating the start and the end of
each frame. It is assumed that image information in FIG. 2 is
read and reproduced. A reading controlling unit 1502 obtains
information representing start address and end address of the
frame A from the edit information storing unit 1501, and reads
the frame A. The frame A can be read normally if no fault is
included in itself stored in an image storing unit 1503, and
it is sent to the an image reproducing unit 1504.
Subsequently, the image reproducing unit 1504 sends the frame
A to an image display unit 1505, and the image display unit
1505 displays image information of the frame A. Consequently,
the frame A is reproduced. Similarly, the frames B and C are
read and reproduced successively. After reading and
reproducing the frame C, the reading control unit 1502 tries
to read the frame D. However, the frame D cannot be read
normally because of damage included in itself stored in the
image storing unit 1503. The reading control unit 1502 judges
that the frame D includes an faulty sector. Accordingly, as
shown in FIG. 4, the reading control unit 1502 makes a
substitution sector in a vacant area of the image storing unit
1503. Also, the reading control unit 1502

<CLAIMS>
An image reproducing device comprising:

an image storing means (103; 203) for storing video frames and permitting video frames to
be read at a speed which is synchronous with a display cycle of one video frame;
an edit information storing means (101; 201) for storing edit information which identifies
which area of the image storing means (103; 203) stores each video frame;
a reading controlling means (102; 202) for controlling the order of reading the video frames
from the image storing means (103; 203) and controlling the output of each video frame

synchronously with the display cycle;
a reproducing and displaying means (106, 107; 206, 207) for reproducing and displaying
the video frames outputted from the image storing means (103; 203) in order;
a faulty area detecting means for monitoring the output of each video frame synchronously
with the display cycle, and detecting the video frame with the faulty area;
a substitution means for substituting the faulty area video frame with a non-faulty video
frame; and
an edit information updating means for updating the edit information stored in the edit
information storing means (101; 201); 
characterised in that
the image storing means (103; 203) comprises a FIFO to which data is transferred in a
reading operation, the reading operation having associated therewith a preset minimum frame

number which guarantees successive reproduction if the video frames are stored successively in
physical sense, the FIFO being of a size which can accommodate a block of data having at least

the preset minimum frame number of video frames, the reading of the video frames being carried
out at the speed which is synchronous with the display cycle of one video frame as long as more

than the minimum frame number of video frames are stored successively, and reconstructing
output of each video frame if its storage area includes a faulty area;
in that
 the substitution means comprises: 
a faulty area location calculating means for calculating location of the video frame which
includes the faulty area;
a copy range setting means for setting a plurality of video frames which include the video
frame with the faulty area and which are more than the preset minimum frame number as a copy

range;
a vacant area reserving means for reserving a vacant area within the image storing means
(103; 203) to which all the video frames set as the copy range can be copied;
a copy means for directly copying the video frames set as the copy range except the video
frame with the faulty area into the vacant area, and processing the video frame with the faulty

area by copying a preset range of image which is located outside the faulty area of the video
frame into a part of the vacant area which is reserved for the video frame repeatedly;
and in that
 the edit information updating means is arranged to update the edit information
stored in the edit information storing means (101; 201) into the edit information obtained after

copying by the copy means.
The image reproducing device of Claim 1, wherein the image storing means (103; 203)
stores a compressed image, and the reproducing and displaying means (106, 107; 206, 207) has

an expanding unit for expanding the compressed image from the image storing means (103; 203).

hard disk and an optical disk.
The image reproducing device of any preceding claim, wherein the image storing means
(103; 203) comprises a recording medium for recording image including the video frames, and a

head (1033) for reading the preset minimum frame number of video frames which guarantees
successive reproduction as a single block in a preset block cycle. 
The image reproducing device of Claim 4, wherein the FIFO outputs underflow when it
tries to output the video frame with the faulty area, and the faulty area detecting means judges the

underflow as the video frame with the faulty area.
The image reproducing device of Claim 5, wherein each video frame includes two image
fields to be scanned according to an interlaced scanning method;


the faulty area detecting means detects the field with the faulty area;
the faulty area location calculating means calculates location of the faulty area relating to
the frame and the field; and
the copy means includes a double copying means for dividing the video frame including
the faulty area into a field including the faulty area and a field which does not include the faulty

area, setting the field which does not include the faulty area as the copy range, and copying the
copy range into the vacant area which is reserved for the video frame which includes the faulty

area twice.
The image reproducing device of Claim 6, wherein the reading controlling means (102;
202) comprises a pointer (P) for designating the video frames for a single block to be transferred

from the recording medium to the FIFO, and changing its value at the end of each block transfer,
and a counter for changing its value upon each output of one image field from the FIFO and

resetting itself when the pointer (P) changes its value; and

the faulty area location calculating means calculates location of the faulty area relating to
the frame and the field according to the value of the pointer (P) and the value of the counter

obtained at the moment that the FIFO outputs the underflow.
