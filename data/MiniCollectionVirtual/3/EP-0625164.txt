<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel cyclic compounds
containing carbocyclic ring systems useful as
antagonists of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
complex, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such
cyclic compounds, and to the use of these compounds for
preparing a medicament for the inhibition of platelet
aggregation.Activation of platelets and the resulting platelet
aggregation and secretion of factors by the platelets
have been associated with different pathophysiological
conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
thromboembolic disorders, for example, the
thromboembolic disorders associated with unstable
angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic
attack, stroke, atherosclerosis and diabetes. The
contribution of platelets to these disease processes
stems from their ability to form aggregates, or platelet
thrombi, especially in the arterial wall following
injury.Platelets are known to play an essential role in
the maintenance of hemostasis and in the pathogenesis of
arterial thrombosis. Platelet activation has been shown
to be enhanced during coronary thrombolysis which can
lead to delayed reperfusion and reocclusion. Clinical
studies with aspirin, ticlopidine and a monoclonal
antibody for platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa provide 
biochemical evidence for platelet involvement in
unstable angina, early stage of acute myocardial
infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebral
ischemia, and stroke.Platelets are activated by a wide variety of
agonists resulting in platelet shape change, secretion
of granular contents and aggregation. Aggregation of
platelets serves to further focus clot formation by
concentrating activated clotting factors in one site.
Several endogenous agonists including adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, arachidonic acid,
thrombin, and collagen, have been identified. Because
of the involvement of several endogenous agonists in
activating platelet function and aggregation, an
inhibitor which acts against all agonists would
represent a more efficacious antiplatelet agent than
currently available antiplatelet drugs, which are
agonist-specific.Current antiplatelet drugs are effective against
only one type of agonist; these include aspirin, which
acts against arachidonic acid; ticlopidine, which acts
against ADP; thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitors or
receptor antagonists, which act against thromboxane A2;
and hirudin, which acts against thrombin.Recently, a common pathway for all known agonists
has been identified, namely platelet glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa complex
