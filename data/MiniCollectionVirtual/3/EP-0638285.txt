<ABSTRACT>
Pulses of ultrasound are focused in a patient's 
body to create an interrogation volume where a 

characteristic of blood flow is to be measured. The 
bandwidth of the back-scattered Doppler return signal is 

measured. In order to measure flow velocity independent 
of direction, the interrogation volume is generated 

substantially as a sphere in which the range dimension 
is set equal to the lateral dimensions (azimuth and 

elevation) of the interrogation signal. The Doppler 
bandwidth is then scaled to provide a direction-independent 

measurement of flow velocity. In order to 
determine the direction of flow, the interrogation 

volume is generated substantially as an ellipsoid. The 
long axis of the ellipsoidal interrogation volume is 

then rotated until the measured Doppler bandwidth is at 
a minimum, which is reached when the long axis is 

aligned with the flow direction. The interrogation 
volume is preferably rotated and translated using 

differential phasing of the ultrasonic signals from 
different transducer elements (62a, ..., 62e; 71(1,1), 

..., 71(20, 20)) in a two-dimensional array.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a system and a method for 
using ultrasound to sense the speed and direction of flow 
of a fluid, such as blood in a coronary artery. The measurement of blood flow in the coronary 
arteries is a well-known technique for diagnosing coronary 
artery diseases. There are, consequently, many different 
devices and methods for determining this blood flow. One common sensing technique involves the use of 
ultrasound. Using this technique, ultrasound is directed 
into the body of the patient and tiny particles such as 
red blood cells, which are suspended in the blood, scatter 
the ultrasonic energy back towards the transducer. The 
transducer then converts the back-scattered ultrasonic 
energy into an electrical signal that is processed in some 
known manner to determine an estimate of the flow. One great advantage of ultrasonic sensing is that it 
is non-invasive, meaning that it can be carried out 
without having to cut or insert anything into the 
patient's body. A problem one faces when using existing 
ultrasonic flow measurement techniques, however, is that 
measurements are often made through the "keyhole" between 
the ribs in a transthoracic scan, where the coronary 
arteries typically twist over the curved surface of the 
moving heart wall. The direction of the blood in the 
arteries or the motion of the heart wall with respect to 
the line-of-sight of the ultrasonic beam is therefore 
usually not known. This is a serious problem for the many 
common techniques that use the principle of Doppler shift.  The Doppler principle used in existing techniques for 
calculating flow velocity v based on the frequency shift 
of ultrasonic waves scattered by moving red cells can be 
expressed as follows: 
fd=2(vc)f₀·cosϑ , in which f₀ is the frequency of the ultrasonic wave sent 
into the body, v is the flow velocity, c is the speed of 
sound, ϑ is the angle between the line-of-sight direction 
of the beam and the flow, and fd is the detected frequency 
shift of the signal that returns to the transducer. As 
long as cos ϑ is not equal to zero, the frequency shift 
will increase with increasing flow velocity. As the equation shows, it is not possible using 
conventional Doppler techniques to detect any frequency 
shift if ϑ equals 90°, that is, if the flow is 
perpendicular to the line-of-sight of the ultrasonic 
transducer, regardless of how fast the blood is flowing. 
Police officers who use radar guns to check for speeders 
are a more common example of this problem: the officers
