<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing lubricating 
oils from waste or virgin polymers, especially olefin polymers such 

as polyethylene. The polymer is first thermally cracked in a 
fluidised bed and under inert conditions to form a waxy product and 

the latter, optionally after a hydrotreatment step, is catalytically 
isomerized and fractionated to recover the lubricating oil. This 

oil can be used in automotive applications or can be subjected to 
further hydrofinishing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
lubricating oils from waste or virgin polymers, especially olefins 
polymers such as polyethylene. It is well known to crack waste or virgin polyolefins to form 
gaseous products including ethylene and/or propylene by thermal 
cracking of such polyolefins. It is also known, for instance from 
US-A-3845157 to produce synthetic hydrocarbon lubricants by 
catalytic cracking of ethylene/olefin copolymers using a silica-alumina 
catalyst in a first stage. The catalyst used in this first 
stage not only facilitates the cracking step but also isomerises the 
product. In a second stage, the product resulting from the 
cracking is hydrogenated to form the synthetic lubricant. However, 
such a process which uses a catalyst in the first stage is unlikely 
to be successful with waste polymers because the impurities such as 
basic nitrogen compounds in the waste polymer are likely to poison 
and deactivate the catalyst. Another prior art process, namely US-A-3676521, claims a 
particular ethylene/propylene copolymer oil containing 29-71 mol% of 
ethylene. A titanium-aluminium catalyst is used for the 
polymerization and the molecular weight of the resulting oil is 
adjusted by thermal cracking. This reference states that a high 
proportion of propylene in the polymerization step ensures that the 
product will have sufficient methyl groups on the carbon backbone 
which means that the process does not require an isomerization step. 
However, such a process cannot be employed with a waste polymer feed  
 
because such a feed inevitably has a varied composition and 
cannot be relied upon to have sufficient methyl groups in the carbon 
backbone for use in the thermal cracking step. It has now been found that by applying a suitable cracking 
process to the polymer followed by a hydrotreatment step it would be 
possible to convert the waste or virgin polymers to a product 
suitable for use as a lubricating oil. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for converting 
polymers to lubricating oils, said process comprising: 
a) thermally cracking the polymer in a fluidised bed of a 
material 
substantially inert under the reaction conditions at elevated 
temperature so as to produce a waxy product, b) optionally hydrotreating the waxy product when said product 
from step a)is contaminated with heteroatomic and/or 
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons so as to remove 
substantially all of the heteroatomic compounds and polynuclear 
aromatic compounds therefrom and
