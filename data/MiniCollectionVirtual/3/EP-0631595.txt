<ABSTRACT>
Capped polyphenylene ethers are prepared by reaction of a polyphenylene ether with epoxy materials in methods which result in low levels of alkali metal ions and ammonium ions in the resulting product. Such low alkali metal ion and ammonium ion capped polyphenylene ethers are particularly useful in forming high impact blends with polyesters and polyamides, which find utility as molding compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED CAPPED POLYPHENYLENE ETHER FOR HIGH IMPACT BLENDS AND METHOD OF PREPARATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the preparation of polyphenylene ethers which are capped, i.e. functionalized, and to the use of such capped polyphenylene ethers in the preparation of high impact polyester containing and polyamide containing compositions.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPolyphenylene ethers have long been known as a widely used class of thermoplastic engineering resins characterized by excellent hydrolytic stability, dimensional stability, toughness, heat resistance and dielectric properties. Such polyphenylene ethers can be capped with epoxy materials, as for example, epoxy triazine. The capping procedures can result in products having higher workability, solvent resistance, and in some cases, improved other properties. Such capped polyphenylene ethers have been blended with modifying materials or used as modifying materials, as for example, with polyesters and with polyamides, to improve properties.
