<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coaxial electrical connector comprising two complementary connector elements capable of being mated and held in position by screwing on a sleeve on one of the said connector elements, the said sleeve being translationally integral with the other connector element. It comprises a component (17) for operating the sleeve, and means (19, 20) of linkage between the said sleeve and the said operating component (17) which render the latter rotationally integral with the sleeve when tightening is less than a predetermined limiting value and disconnect the operating component from the said sleeve when tightening is greater than the said predetermined limiting value.
