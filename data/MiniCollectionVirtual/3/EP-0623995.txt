<ABSTRACT>
In this arrangement, in which at least one microphone is arranged in the passenger space of a motor vehicle and a reference variable is derived from the signals generated by the microphone, mean values of the absolute amount of the interference signal amplitudes are formed over predetermined times. The reference variable is derived from the mean values which are below mean values formed previously in each case.

Arrangement for controlling the volume of a car
radio as a function of the vehicle noise level, at least

one microphone (6) being arranged in the passenger
compartment (30) of a motor vehicle and a reference

variable (F(i)) being derived from the signals (M(i))
produced by the microphone (6), characterized in that the

mean values (
s
) of the magnitude of the noise signal
amplitudes (S(i)) are formed of over predetermined times,

and in that the reference variable (F(i)) is formed from
the mean value (
s
) whenever the mean value (
s
) lies below
the reference variable respectively formed beforehand,

and is increased by an allowed degree during time
intervals in which the mean value (
s
) does not lie below
the reference variable formed beforehand.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the predetermined time is about 20 ms.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the allowed degree is a

factor between 1.01 and 1.03.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a bandpass filter (8a)

having a passband of about 120 Hz to 3 kHz is connected
downstream of the microphone (6).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the signals are co
nverted
into digital signals, and in that the reference variable

(F(i)) is derived with the aid of a digital signal
processor.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a control variable derived

from the reference variable (F(i)) is restricted to
values between a minimum value and a maximum value, the

minimum value bringing about a preferably adjustable
basic volume setting which exists even if the microphone

(6) does not receive any noise, and the maximum value
being used to prevent a volume which causes auditory

damage.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the averaging and the

derivation of the reference variable, as well as a
subsequent control procedure, are carried out separately

for different frequency ranges.
