<ABSTRACT>
Method and device to scatter preheated sand, crushed stone, urea, road salt, etc. (12) from a spreading vehicle (1) onto aeroplane runways and roads (4) in order to counteract slipperiness caused by snow, ice, sleet, mud and the like (3) in which preheating of the material (12) is via an electronically controlled LP-gas driven burner (8) in close association with feeding (5, 6, 7) of the material (12) from the spreading vehicle (1) to the surface (4) which is to be treated, in such a fashion that the flames from the burners (8) have direct contact with the material which is to be preheated (12). The process can be remotely controlled (11) from the driver cabin (13) of the spreading vehicle (1). The heating system (8-11) can be conveniently mounted to an existing spreading vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
There are many situations where it is desirable to 
counteract slipperiness caused by ice, snow, mud, sleet 
and the like. This can be done, for example, by salting or 
sanding. Not least, this applies to aeroplane runways. Here, urea 
is used in order to "melt" the icecover and sand with a 
particular grain size to provide good friction, because 
aeroplanes can not tolerate road salt or sand of the wrong 
grain size. The sand or urea are spread with a special 
spreading vehicle. The effectiveness of sanding can be 
considerably increased if the sand is preheated, because 
the sand then melts solidly to the icecover on the runway 
and forms a sandpaper-like surface which provides very 
good friction against aeroplane wheels during landing and 
take off. Sand preheating creates the need for methods and devices 
to heat the sand. In a currently used system, the sand is 
stored, continuously heated, in a large silo from which 
the sand is conveyed to the spreading vehicle and placed 
in the spreader hopper. The heated sand is conveyed 
within the spreading vehicle and spread out as desired. The above described technique suffers from serious 
disadvantages. In the first place, it requires large 
investments for the above mentioned sand silo. Secondly, 
because the entire mass of sand is kept continuously 
heated, the sand silo represents a waste of energy which 
also leads to high costs. Thirdly, the technique is not 
particularly effective because the sand continuously loses  
 
heat from the moment it is loaded onto the spreading 
vehicle. Our measurements show that, in fact, the sand has 
only a fraction of its warmth left when it reaches the 
spot where it is to be scattered. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
vehicle-borne method and apparatus to scatter a preheated 
material onto a surface, especially a preheated, granular 
anti-slip material onto runways and roads, in which the 
above described drawbacks are avoided and which gives a 
high safety level and good control and adjustment. An 
additional object of the invention is to provide a heating 
device of the above type which admits of simple 
installation to existing vehicles. A still further object 
of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus of 
the above type which is amenable to low costs, as regards 
material, installation and fuel consumption. According to the invention, these objects are attained in 
a method and apparatus having the characteristics defined 
in the patent claims. The invention shall now be

raised temperature from a vehicle (1) over a roadway (4), 

comprising the steps of feeding the granular material from 
a supply container (2) in the vehicle to a scattering 

means (7) via a feed means (6) and heating the granular 
material during its passage through the feed means, 

characterized in that combustion gases are caused to flow, 
under pressure, into the upstream portion of the feed 

means (6) in order to separate and uniformly heat the 
individual particles in the granular material (12) during 

its passage to the scattering means and to flow out from 
the downstream portion of the feed means (6) in order to 

assist transport of said particles through the feed means
