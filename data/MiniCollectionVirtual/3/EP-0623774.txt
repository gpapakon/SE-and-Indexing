<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an examination process and device for a spring safety valve (1) which is acted upon by a medium (M). To determine the closing pressure (PS) of the safety valve (1), the pressure of the medium (M) is chosen to be smaller than the closing pressure (PS) to be expected. The safety valve (1) is opened by means of an auxiliary lifting device (8) by supplying the latter with an auxiliary medium (H). To close the safety valve (1), the auxiliary medium (H) is drained from the auxiliary lifting device (8). At the same time, a reserve supply of auxiliary medium is passed through the auxiliary lifting device (8) and drained. The closing pressure (PS) is determined from the pressures (PP) and (PH) of the medium (M) and of the auxiliary medium (H) when the safety valve (1) is closing, from the ratio (VA) of the areas of the valve plate (6) of the safety valve (1) and of the poppet (9) of the auxiliary lifting device (8) and from a constant (m) in accordance with the following equation:
