<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a novel transport 
protein, IT10C3. In particular, the present invention relates to nucleic acid 
molecules coding for IT10C3; IT10C3 polypeptides; recombinant nucleic 
acid molecules; cells containing the recombinant nucleic acid molecules; 
antisense IT10C3 nucleic acid constructs; antibodies having binding affinity 
to an IT10C3 polypeptide; hybridomas containing the antibodies; nucleic 
acid probes for the detection of IT10C3 nucleic acid; a method of detecting 
IT10C3 nucleic acid or polypeptide in a sample; and kits containing nucleic 
acid probes or antibodies. Huntington's disease (HD) is a familial neurodegenerative disorder 
that afflicts about 1/10,000 individuals (Martin, J.B. and Gusella, J.F., 
N. Engl. J. Med.315:1267-1276 (1986); Gusella, J.F., Adv. Hum.Genet. 
20:125-151 (1991)). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and 
is characterized by choreiform movements, dementia, and cognitive decline. 
The disorder usually has a mid-life onset, between the ages of 30 to 50 
years, but may in some cases begin very early or much later in life. The  
 
symptoms are progressive and death ensues 10 to 20 years after onset, most 
often as the result of secondary complications of the movement disorder. 
Post-mortem examination of the brains of HD individuals has revealed a 
selective loss of neurons that most dramatically affects the striatum. The 
biochemical cause of this neuronal loss which underlies the symptoms of 
HD has not yet been discovered. Thus, an intensive effort has been 
mounted to apply location cloning techniques to identify the nature of the 
genetic defect. The HD gene has been mapped to a 2.2 Mb region, flanked by the 
loci D4S126 and D4S98 in the terminal cytogenetic subband of the short 
arm of human chromosome 4 (MacDonald, M.E. et al., Neuron3:183-190 
(1989); Bates, G.P. et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 49:7-16 (1991); 
Snell, R.G. et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 51:357-362 (1992)). Analysis of 
linkage disequilibrium on HD chromosomes has revealed that the disorder 
is associated with a wide array of marker haplotypes, but has suggested a 
500 kb segment of the candidate region between D4S180 and D4S182 as the 
most probable location of the genetic defect (MacDonald, M.E. et al., 
Nature Genet.1:99-103 (1992)). The task of isolating all the transcripts 
from the candidate region remains a daunting one, despite the availability 
of cloned genomic DNA (Lin, C.S. et al., Somat. Cell Mol. Genet.17:481-488 
(1991); Bates, G.P. et
