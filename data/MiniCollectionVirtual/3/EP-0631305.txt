<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce an isolation trench in an SOI substrate in which logic components and high-voltage power components are integrated, a trench extending as far as the insulating layer (2) of the SOI substrate is etched. By providing the side walls of the trench with a dopant-containing cover layer and diffusion out from the cover layer, diffusion regions (8) neighbouring the trench are produced. After complete removal of the cover layer, a silicon layer is produced and an insulating structure (11) is formed in the trench by thermal oxidation.

Process for producing an insulation trench in an
SOI substrate in which logic components and high-voltage

power components are integrated,

in which the SOI substrate comprises a monocrystalline
silicon wafer (1), an insulating layer (2) of SiO
2
 which
is arranged thereon, and a monocrystalline silicon layer

(3) arranged on the latter,
in which a trench (6), which extends as far as the
insulating layer (2), is etched into the monocrystalline

silicon layer (3),
in which, in an atmospheric-pressure CVD process
(APCVD), the side walls of the trench (6) are provided

with a doped-glass application layer (7) containing a
dope and,
in which a heat-treatment step is carried out, in which
diffusion regions (8) next to the trench (6) are produced

in the monocrystalline silicon layer (3) by diffusion out
from the application layer (7), and in which the

application layer (7) is liquified,
in which the application layer (7) is fully removed in
an etching process, in which the insulating layer (2) is

attacked,
in which a silicon layer (10) having essentially
conformal ed
ge coverage is deposited,
in which the silicon layer (10) is etched in an anisotropic
etching process in order to form silicon spacers

(101),
in which, by thermal oxidation of the silicon spacers
(101), an insulation structure (11) is produced in the 

trench (6).
Process according to Claim 1, in which the
thermal oxidation is carried out in a temperature range

of between 900 and 1200°C in a humid atmosphere.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
silicon layer (10) is amorphously deposited.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

in which, after the application layer (7) has been
removed, an insulating layer (9), which contains at least

one of the compounds SiO
2
 or Si
3
N
4
, is produced with
essentially conformal edge coverage, and the silicon

layer (10) is applied on its surface,
in which the silicon layer (10) is etched selectively
with respect to the insulating layer (9) in an

anisotropic etching process, the horizontal faces of the
insulating layer (9) being exposed, and silicon spacers

(101) being left on perpendicular flanks of the monocrystalline
silicon layer (3).
Process according to Claim 4, in which, by
depositing and etching back a further silicon layer, any

cavity remaining inside the insulation structure (11) in
the trench (6) is filled with a silicon filler (13).
Process according to Claim 5,

in which the trench (6) is etched by using a trench
mask (4) which is formed as a layer sequence consisting

of a lower layer (41) of thermal SiO
2
, a central layer
(42) of CVD Si
3
N
4
 and an upper layer (43) of CVD SiO
2
,
in which the upper layer (43) of the trench mask (4) is
also removed when the application layer is removed,
in which the further silicon layer is etched back in
such a way that the silicon filler (13) terminates below

the lower layer (41) of the trench mask (4),
in which the surface of the silicon filler (13) is
oxidized so as to produce an insulation seal (11) which

fully covers the silicon filler (13).
Process according to Claim 6, in which the
silicon filler (13) is oxidized in a temperature range of

between 900°C and 1200°C in a humid atmosphere.
Process according to Claim 4, in which, in a CVD 
process with the use of a process gas containing at least

O
3
 and Si(OC
2
H
5
)
4
, any cavity remaining inside the
insulation structure (11) in the trench (6) is filled

with an SiO
2
 filler.
