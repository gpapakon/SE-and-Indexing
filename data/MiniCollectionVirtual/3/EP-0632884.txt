<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structural
assembly that transmits and measures linear forces along
and moments about three orthogonal axes. More
particularly, a structural assembly is disclosed having
structural elements connected with elliptical fillets to
minimize stress concentration and interchangeable
sensing elements with very low cross talk or the
likelihood of affecting the reading in one axis from
loads in another axis.Transducers or load cells for determining
rotational loads and axial loads about and along three
orthogonal axes have been known. Two such load cells
are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,640,138 and U.S.
Patent No. 4,821,582. U.S. Patent No. 4,640,138
illustrates a multiple axis load-sensitive transducer
having inner and outer members that are joined by a pair
of axially spaced spiders. The spiders comprise arms
that are integral with the inner member and are
connected to the outer member by flexible straps that
have longitudinal lengths with the ends of the straps
fixed to the outer member. The arms of the spiders are
fixed to the center of the associated strap. Loads are
sensed as a function of bending on the spider arms.U.S. Patent No. 4,821,582 illustrates a load
transducer that measures linear forces in three axes and
moments about two of the axes. The transducer has inner
and outer structures connected by load-sensitive spider
arms or shear beams. The outer ends of the spider are
connected to outer lengths which are stiff when the
inner structure is loaded in a direction along an axis
perpendicular to the plane of the spider. The present invention relates to a structural
assembly as defined in claim 1 that measures forces along and moments about a
plurality of orthogonal axes. The structural assembly
has high force and moment isolation features such that
measured values obtained for each principal axis are
substantially decoupled from one another. The assembly
minimizes stress concentration within the structure as
well as minimizes the likelihood of forces and moments
along and about one orthogonal axis from affecting
values obtained for another axis even when large forces
and moments are present on the other axes.The assembly includes a support structure
having a first end and a second end that define a
longitudinal axis. The support structure is oriented
such that the longitudinal axis is on one of the
plurality of orthogonal loading axes. Manufactured
preferably from a single unitary piece of material, the
support structure is substantially rigid for forces
along the
