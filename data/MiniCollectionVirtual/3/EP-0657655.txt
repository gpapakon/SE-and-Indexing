<ABSTRACT>
Compressor 14 of a gas turbine engine has a final 
centrifugal stage 18 discharging air into annulus 20. 

Diffuser 20 are straight and of frustoconical shape receiving 
air from the annulus. A side cut produces opening 38 in the 

side of each diffuser. Much of the flow exits through, and is 
directed by these openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to air compressor discharge and in 
particular to the discharge from a centrifugal stage to a 
confined volume of a gas turbine engine. The gas turbine engine air must be compressed before it's 
use in the combustor. The compressor may be either axial, 
centrifugal, or a combination of the two. In certain engines axial stages are followed by a 
centrifugal final stage. Such an arrangement is shown in U.S. 
Patent 5,165,226 along with delivery of the compressed air to 
the combustor. Air leaving the centrifugal stage is at a high velocity 
travelling with a major tangential velocity component. This 
velocity passing into the annulus surrounding the centrifugal 
stage must be transformed to pressure energy, and the air 
delivered to the combustor with minimum pressure loss. The 
intense swirl must also be reduced. The swirl continues 
abated somewhat into the combustor, passing through the side 
wall cooling openings. Some swirl facilitates mixing, while 
a high swirl creates ignition stability problems in the 
combustor.  It is desirable that an aircraft gas turbine engine be as 
small as possible both as to length and diameter. Therefore 
the conversion of velocity energy to pressure energy must be 
accomplished in a minimum volume. Conventional practice uses a bent trumpet diffuser to 
transform this high velocity air. The trumpet receives air 
tangentially from the compressor discharge annulus and expands 
the flow area. This reduces the velocity and velocity head of 
the airflow. The trumpet then bends toward the combustion 
supply volume while still expanding the flow area. The reduction of velocity before the turn is used to 
reduce the loss during the turn. Secondary flow in the form 
of twin circular paths occurs during the turn, resulting in 
some increased pressure drop in the remainder of the trumpet. 
Attempts to minimize this loss puts further constraints on the 
freedom to further shape the trumpet. The additional 
increased flow area after the bend is an attempt to reduce the 
exit loss. Straightening vanes have been placed near the exit of the 
trumpet to reduce the swirl in the chamber. These have been 
only partially successful and also introduce further pressure 
loss. According to a first aspect of the invention, there 
is provided a gas turbine engine, comprising a 
combustor, a confining case defining an annular air 
supply volume communicating with said combustor, a 
centrifugal air compressor supplying air to said supply 
volume, having a centrifugal final
