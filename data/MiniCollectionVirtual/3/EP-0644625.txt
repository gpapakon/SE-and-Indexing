<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly used for charging A 
power battery (2) of an electric vehicle includes a power 

source side connector (6) and a vehicle side connector (3). 
The power source side connector (6) is detachably connected 

to the vehicle side connector (3) mounted on the body (1) of 
an electric vehicle. A locking device (30) disposed in the 

power source side connector (6) is turned to a locking state 
with an ignition key (31) of the electric vehicle so that 

the connectors (6, 3) are locked in the mating engagement. 
Since the power source side connector (6) cannot be 

disconnected from the vehicle side connector (3), charging 
can be prevented from being inadvertently interrupted. The 

charging can be initiated only when the connectors (6, 3) 
are locked in the mating engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric vehicle charging
connector assembly used for charging a power battery of an
electric vehicle.Social problems on environmental and energy affairs
have recently demanded provision of an electric vehicle
loaded with a power battery. Some types of electric
vehicles have been put to practical use. The power battery
provided in a body of the electric vehicle needs to be
frequently charged and accordingly, an external battery
charger needs to be readily connected to the power battery
of the electric vehicle. Use of a connector assembly has
been proposed for the purpose of connecting between the
battery charger and the power battery of the electric
vehicle.The connector assembly used for the above-described
purpose includes a vehicle side connector housing mounted on
the body of the electric vehicle and vehicle side terminals
enclosed in the vehicle side connector housing. The vehicle
side terminals are connected to the power battery of the
electric vehicle. The connector assembly further includes a
power source side connector having a power source side
connector housing and power source side terminals enclosed
in the power source side connector housing. The power
source side connector housing is mated with and unmated from
the vehicle side connector housing so that the power source
side terminals are connected to and disconnected from the 
vehicle side terminals respectively. Furthermore, various
types of mechanical engaging structure or mechanism are
provided for holding both connector housings in the mated
stated.Charging the electric vehicle needs a period of time
longer than gassing a gasoline-fueled automobile.
Accordingly, an operator cannot always watch the charging.
In particular, when a power battery of the electric vehicle
is charged at a house of an owner not at a charging station,
a quick charging in use of a large current cannot be performed.
Accordingly, charging is performed overnight for
the electric vehicle parked at a garage or the like. In
such a case, the power source side connector and the vehicle
side connector are mated together so that charging is initiated,
and the connector assembly is left in the mated state
for a long period of time without the operator attended.In the conventional connectors of the above-described
type, however, the engaging mechanism holding the connectors
in the mated state is not provided with any safety
countermeasures. Accordingly, charging is interrupted when
an intruder disengages the engaging mechanism of the power
sourc

An electric vehicle charging connector assembly externally charging a power battery
(2) provided in a body (1) of an electric vehicle, thereby powering the electric

vehicle, the connector assembly comprising a vehicle side connector housing (10)
provided on the body (1) of the electric vehicle, vehicle side terminals (13) enclosed

in the vehicle side connector housing (10), a power source side connector
housing (22) mated with and unmated from the vehicle side connector housing

(10), power source side terminals (25) enclosed in the power source side connector
housing (22) to be electrically connected to the respective vehicle side terminals

(13) when the power source side connector housing (22) is mated with the
vehicle side connector housing (10), and an engagement mechanism (40) provided

on the power source side connector housing (22) and the vehicle side connector
housing (10) for holding both power source and vehicle side connector housings

(22, 10) in a mating engagement when assuming a first state, the engagement
mechanism (40) allowing both connector housings (22, 10) to be released from the

mating engagement when assuming a second state, characterized by a preventing
mechanism (35) for preventing the engagement mechanism (40) from being

turned from the first state to the second state and locking device (30) provided in

mechanism (35) when assuming a locking state, so that the engagement mechanism
(40) is disallowed to be turned from the first state to the second state, the

locking device (30) when assuming an unlocking state, so that the engagement
mechanism (40) is allowed to be turned from the first state to the second state.
A connector assembly according to claim 1 characterized by a charging power
circuit provided between the power source side terminals (25) and the external

power source (5) and that the locking device (30) is provided in the power source
side connector housing (22) for locking both vehicle side and power source side

connector housings (10, 22) in the mating engagement and a protecting switch 
(101) is provided in the charging power circuit to be closed when the locking

device (30) has been operated under a predetermined condition.
A connector assembly according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the locking

device (30) is turned between the locking state and the unlocking state with an ignition
key (31) of the electric vehicle.
A connector assembly according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the locking
device (30) comprises an electronic lock device including a code input section

(90) provided in a surface of the power source side connector housing (22), a
memory (94) for storing data of an unlocking code, a decoding section (96) comparing

a code inputted to the code input section (90) with the data of the unlocking
code stored in the memory (94), thereby generating a decoding signal on condition

that the inputted code has a predetermined relation with the unlocking code, and
