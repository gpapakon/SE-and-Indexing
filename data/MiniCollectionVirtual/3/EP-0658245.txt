<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for producing liquid carbon dioxide is disclosed. A process stream (60) which comprises carbon dioxide and a balance substantially of nitrogen and water is cooled (70, 90). The process stream is compressed (130) so that all but trace amounts of water is condensed out, cleaned (240) to remove trace amounts of water, long-chain hydrocarbons and particulates, and separated (260) into a nitrogen-rich gaseous stream (270) which is expanded (300) to produce an expanded nitrogen-rich gaseous stream and a carbon dioxide-rich gaseous stream (280) which is compressed (290). The energy of expanding is used to compress the carbon dioxide-rich gaseous stream. The compressed carbon dioxide-rich gaseous stream is cooled (330) by the expanded nitrogen-rich gaseous stream to liquefy the carbon dioxide and reduce the temperature of the gaseous nitrogen in the stream. The liquefied carbon dioxide (380) is withdrawn as product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for the production of 
liquid carbon dioxide and, in a most preferred form, permits the trigeneration of 
electricity, heat and liquid carbon dioxide. The invention relates in 
particular to a process and apparatus as set forth in the 
pre-characterizing portions of Claims 1,7. U.S. Patent 4,942,734 relates to a process where methane-rich fuel is combusted 
in a gas turbine (internal combustion heat engine). Additional methane-rich fuel is 
injected into the exhaust stream resulting from the combustion step to fire a steam boiler 
which produces steam to turn a steam turbine (external combustion heat engine), the gas 
turbine and the steam turbine being directly connected to an electric generator. In 
accordance with the present invention, any heat engine may be used, and the same can 
be internally or externally fired by any fuel and directly connected to either an electric 
generator or any other mechanical device that can do work, such as a compressor. The 
subject patent relates to the cogeneration of electricity and liquid carbon dioxide, 
whereas in accordance with the present invention the trigeneration of electricity, heat 
and liquid carbon dioxide is achieved. While the subject patent uses an amine solvent 
absorption column selective for carbon dioxide and a stripper column to remove carbon 
dioxide from flue gas, in accordance with the present invention it is most preferred to 
use a gas permeable membrane which is selective for carbon dioxide to remove carbon 
dioxide from the process stream. The subject patent involves the use of an ammonia  
 
absorption refrigeration cycle to liquefy compressed and dried carbon dioxide in a carbon 
dioxide condenser. In accordance with the present invention, an expansion turbine may 
be used to extract work from a high-pressure residual nitrogen-rich process stream which 
is preferably generated in the membrane separator above mentioned. The process of the 
present invention may also involve a recuperative heat exchange between the resultant 
expanded low temperature residual nitrogen-rich stream and a compressed and dried 
carbon dioxide-rich permeate stream in a carbon dioxide condenser. In accordance with 
the present invention, either an absorption or vapor-compression refrigeration cycle can 
also be used to liquefy compressed and dried carbon dioxide in a carbon dioxide 
condenser. U.S. Patent 5,001,902 relates to the cogeneration of electricity and liquid carbon 
dioxide whereas the process
