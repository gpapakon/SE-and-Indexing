<ABSTRACT>
A closing device for drawers. Provided on each side of the drawer is a pull-out rail (6) fixed to the drawer and a supporting rail (4) fixed to a furniture corpus, as well as a middle rail (5) running between the supporting rail (4) and the pull-out rail (6). The closing device comprises a tilting segment (11) under spring action and a driving pin (9) engaging therein. The tilting segment (11) rests on a slide (12) which is acted upon by a spring (13) and is displaceable rectilinearly in the pull-out direction of the drawer. The driving pin (9) is of elongate construction in the pull-out direction of the drawer. The tilting segment (11) has a receiving notch (20) for the driving pin (9), the width (B) of which notch is equal to the length of the driving pin (9) and the depth (F) of which notch is greater than the width (b) of the driving pin (9).

<CLAIMS>
A closing apparatus for drawers, there being provided on 
each side of the drawer a pull-out rail secured to the drawer and 

a support rail secured to a furniture carcass and preferably a 
central rail extending between the support rail and the pull-out 

rail, and load-transmitting rollers or the like being mounted on 
or between the rails, and the closing apparatus comprising a 

tilting segment under spring action and an entraining peg 
engaging therein, the tilting segment being mounted on a carriage 

which is acted upon by a spring and is displaceable in a straight 
line in the direction of pulling out the drawer, characterized 

in that the entraining peg (9) is constructed to be elongate in 
the direction of pulling out the drawer. 
A closing apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the tilting segment (11) has a receiving notch (20) for the 

entraining peg (9) whereof the width (B) is equal to the length 
of the entraining peg (9) and whereof the depth (F) is larger 

than the width (b) of the entraining peg (9). 
A closing apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the entraining peg (9) is formed by two pins (9'). 
A closing apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the pins (9') are parts of a U-shaped bow. 
A closing apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the carriage (12) has two guide pegs (16, 

17) by means of which it is guided in the guideway (15), formed 
by a groove or the like, of a guide casing (10), and in that one 

of the guide pegs simultaneously serves as a bearing peg for the 
tilting segment. 
A closing apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in  
 

that the receiving notch (20) is formed by an edge (22) which 
projects from the tilting segment (11) in the manner of a box. 
A closing apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, there 
being constructed on the guide casing a control cam against which 

the tilting segment is supported when the drawer is pulled out 
and which prevents the tilting segment from being displaced under 

the spring action, characterized in that the control cam (19) is 
arranged next to the guideway (15) for the tilting segment (11) 

and vertically offset therefrom.
