<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable fastener assembly is characterised by 
comprising: a receptacle member (12), a connecting member 

(14), and engagement means (38, 60; 44, 62) for retaining 
said connecting member to said receptacle member upon 

relative movement in a first direction ("A"), and for 
maintaining said retention whilst allowing relative 

movement between said receptacle member and said connecting 
member for a predetermined distance in a second direction 

("B") perpendicular to said first direction, said 
connecting member becoming disengaged from said receptacle 

member upon movement in said second direction beyond said 
predetermined distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to adjustable fastener 
assemblies which are especially, but not exclusively, 
suitable for use to connect two panels or to support a 
windshield with respect to an automobile frame. Fastener assemblies are known which support and 
position one member with respect to another member and are 
adjustable after initial positioning. An example of such a 
fastener assembly is illustrated in US-A-4172000 which 
discloses a method and device for fixing a moulding on a 
windshield by use of a moulding clip which supports the 
windshield with respect to a windshield frame. The clip 
includes a supporting piece which is adhesively secured to 
an edge of the windshield. A movable holding piece is 
slidingly engaged to the supporting piece from one end 
thereof and held in position by a ratchet and pawl 
mechanism which allows movement in the same direction as 
the sliding engagement. After attaching the clip to the 
windshield and initial positioning of the windshield within 
the frame, a moulding piece is connected to the holding 
piece enabling the moulding piece to be moved with respect 
to the supporting piece to finally position and support the 
windshield against the frame. Such a fastener assembly is 
not only difficult to assemble due to its many parts and 
its sliding engagement in the same direction as adjustment, 
which is parallel to the windshield, but it does not enable 
ready engagement and disengagement and it also relies on a 
separate moulding strip. According to the present invention, however, an 
adjustable fastener assembly is characterised by 
comprising: a receptacle member, a connecting member, and 
engagement means for retaining said connecting member to 
said receptacle member upon relative movement in a first 
direction, and for maintaining said retention whilst  
 
allowing relative movement between said receptacle member 
and said connecting member for a predetermined distance in 
a second direction perpendicular to said first direction, 
said connecting member becoming disengaged from said 
receptacle member upon movement in said second direction 
beyond said predetermined distance. Preferably, said engagement means provides a snap 
assembly upon predetermined movement between said 
receptable member and said connecting member in said first 
direction. More particularly, said receptacle member 
includes two resilient side walls formed with respective 
barbs which can snap engage outside respective shoulders 
formed on an adjacent two side walls of said

An adjustable fastener assembly is characterised by 
comprising: a receptacle member (12), a connecting member 

(14), and engagement means (38, 60; 44, 62) for retaining 
said connecting member to said receptacle member upon 

relative movement in a first direction ("A"), and for 
maintaining said retention whilst allowing relative 

movement between said receptacle member and said connecting 
member for a predetermined distance in a second direction 

("B") perpendicular to said first direction, said 
connecting member becoming disengaged from said receptacle 

member upon movement in said second direction beyond said 
predetermined distance. 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said engagement means provides a snap 

assembly (38, 60) upon predetermined movement between said 
receptable member and said connecting member in said first 

direction. 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to claim 2, 
characterised in that said receptacle member (12) includes 

two resilient side walls (28,30) formed with respective 
barbs (38) which can snap engage outside respective 

shoulders (60) formed on an adjacent two side walls (48, 
50) of said connecting member (14). 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to any 
preceding claim, characterised in that said engagement 

means provides a ratchet assembly (44, 62) for incremental 
movement between said receptacle member and said connecting 

member in said second direction. 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to claim 3 
and claim 4, characterised in that said receptacle member 

(12) includes a base (24) formed with ratchet teeth (44) 
which can sequentially engage with ratchet teeth (62) 

formed on a top (46) of said connecting member (14) as a 
result of said base (24) and/or said top (46) being 

resiliently flexible. 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to any one 
of claims 1 to 5, characterised by including means (16) for 

locating said receptacle member (12) with respect to a 
first article (15), and means (16') for locating said 

connecting member (14) with respect to a second article 
(15a). 
An adjustable fastener assembly according to any one 
of claims 1 to 5, characterised by said receptacle member 

(12) having a surface for engaging a portion of a 
windshield (18), and said connecting member (14) having a 

surface for engaging a portion (70) of a windshield frame 
(72) of an automobile.
