<ABSTRACT>
Radio zones (2a through 2d) are each assigned radio 
frequency channels of the number corresponding to the zone 

traffic, one frequency (f1) of the radio frequency channel is 
assigned in common to all radio zones, and radio channels 

of the same frequency are assigned spectrum spreading codes 
different for each zone. A mobile station is provided with 

two correlators (14 and 15). For example, if the received 
signal level lowers when the mobile station stays in the 

radio zone (2a) and is in conversation over the channel of a 
frequency (f2), the mobile station once switches the 

communication to a channel of the common frequency (f1) and 
continues the communication using one of the correlators, 

while at the same time the mobile station scans spectrum 
spreading codes for control channels of the respective radio 

zones by the other correlator for measuring the received 
signal levels of the control channels and determines a 

destination radio zone which provides the maximum received 
signal level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hand-off method 
and a mobile station for a spread spectrum cellular mobile 
communication system. The cellular mobile communication system is now 
operational as a digital automobile telephone system. In 
the digital mobile telephone system, as shown in Fig. 1A, a 
service area 1 is split into a plurality of radio zones 2a, 
2b, 2c, ..., which are assigned control channels 3a, 3b, 
3c, ... of individual frequencies, and the control channels 
3a, 3b, 3c, ... are transmitted from radio base stations 4a, 
4b, 4c, ... installed in the radio zones 2a, 2b, 2c, ..., 
respectively. When a mobile station 5 hands off during 
conversation, it measures the received levels of the 
control channels 3a, 3b, 3c, ... from the radio zones 2a, 
2b, 2c, ... one after another through utilization of idle 
time slots I of the TDMA scheme which transmits and receives 
in specified time slots (Tx) and (Rx) as shown in Fig. 1B, 
then compares the measured received levels and selects the 
radio zone of the maximum received level as a destination 
or new radio zone. On the other hand, in the spread spectrum mobile 
communication system, a single radio frequency is assigned 
in common to all radio zones involved and a plurality of 
spectrum spreading codes are assigned to each radio zone; 
one possible method for hand-off in this system is to scan 
the spectrum spreading codes by a correlator of the mobile 
station, select a destination radio zone by measuring and 
comparing the received levels every radio zone and set the 
spectrum spreading codes of the destination radio zone in  
 
the correlator. In the spread spectrum mobile communication 
system, however, it is necessary to prepare a wide-band 
radio frequency channel so that when traffic of the radio 
zones is unbalanced, many spectrum spreading codes could be 
used to accommodate or deal with the traffic imbalance; 
this inevitably leads to overdesign of low-traffic radio 
zones. To avoid this, it is possible to employ a system 
configuration wherein a plurality of radio channels of 
different frequencies but of the same bandwidth 
corresponding to a certain traffic volume are prepared, 
radio zones of low traffic are assigned only one of the 
radio channels, radio zones of high traffic are assigned two 
or more of the radio channels and the radio channel of the 
same frequency is assigned a different spectrum spreading 
code at least every group of adjacent radio zones. In this 
instance, each communication channel is defined by a set
