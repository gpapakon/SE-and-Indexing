<ABSTRACT>
Sleeveless casing portions (200, 202) are provided 
on opposite sides of a fracture initiation location to 

accommodate casing (20) and formation (24) movement during 
fracturing of a well. The fracture initiation location may 

be provided by forming openings (36A, 36C) through the well 
casing (20) and then forming fan-shaped slots (34A, 34C) in 

the formation (24) surrounding the casing (20). These slots 
(34A, 34C) may be formed by a hydraulic jet which is 

directed through the opening and then pivoted generally 
about the point of the opening. These fan-shaped slots 

circumscribe an angle about the axis of the casing 
substantially greater than the angle circumscribed by the 

opening itself through which the slot was formed. These 
techniques are particularly applicable to fracturing of 

horizontal wells, but are also useful on vertical wells.

<DESCRIPTION>
Several different techniques are currently used 
for the completion of horizontal wells. A first, very 
common manner of completing a horizontal well is to case and 
cement the vertical portion of the well, and to leave the 
horizontal portion of the well which runs through the 
producing formation as an open hole, i.e. without any casing 
in place therein. Hydrocarbon fluids in the formation are 
produced into the open hole and then through the casing in 
the vertical portion of the well. A second technique which is commonly used for the 
completion of horizontal wells is to place a length of 
slotted casing in the horizontal portion of the well. The 
purpose of the slotted casing is to prevent the open hole 
from collapsing. A gravel pack may be placed around the 
slotted casing. The slotted casing may run for extended 
lengths through the formation, for example as long as one 
mile. A third technique which is sometimes used to 
complete  
 
horizontal wells is to cement casing in both the vertical and 
horizontal portions of the well and then to provide 
communication between the horizontal portion of the casing and 
the producing formation by means of perforations or casing 
valves. The formation may also be fractured by creating 
fractures initiating at the location of the perforations or 
the casing valves. In this third technique, the formation of perforations is 
often done through use of explosive charges which are carried 
by a perforating gun. The explosive charges create holes 
which penetrate the side wall of the casing and penetrate the 
cement surrounding the casing. Typically, the holes will be 
in a pattern extending over a substantial length of the 
casing. When the communication between the casing and the 
producing formation is provided by casing valves, those valves 
may be like those seen in U. S. Patent No. 4,949,788 to Szarka 
et al., U. S. Patent No. 4,979,561 to Szarka, U. S. Patent No. 
4,991,653 to Schwegman, U. S. Patent No. 5,029,644 to Szarka 
et al., and U. S. Patent No. 4,991,654 to Brandell et al., all 
assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Such 
casing valves also provide a large number of radial bore type 
openings communicating the casing bore with the surrounding 
formation. When utilizing either perforated casing or casing valves 
like those just described, the fracturing fluid enters the 
formation through a large multitude of small radial bores at  
 
a variety of longitudinal positions along the casing and 
there is no accurate control over where

A method of fracturing a subsurface formation (24) 
of a well having a well casing (20) cemented in a borehole 

(12) intersecting said subsurface formation, which method 
comprises: 


(a) providing an opening (36A, 36C) through said 
casing (20) communicating an interior of said casing with 

said subsurface formation (24); 
(b) providing at least a first sleeveless 
expandable casing portion (200) in said casing; 
(c) communicating a fracturing fluid through said 
opening (36A, 36C) to said subsurface formation (24); 
(d) applying pressure to said fracturing fluid and 
through said opening (36A, 36C) to said subsurface 

formation (24); 
(e) initiating a fracture in said subsurface 
formation (24) adjacent said opening (36A, 36C)

move with said subsurface formation (24) by means of 

expansion of said first expandable casing portion (200), 
thereby preventing destruction of a bond between said casing 

and cement (22) surrounding said casing (20) during step
