<ABSTRACT>
An SS7 signalling network is monitored by measuring and displaying extreme 
values of:

 
imbalance in message processing load between members of an STP pair;

 
imbalance in message traffic load on A-links between an SSP/SCP and each member of its 

associated STP pair; and
 

imbalance in message traffic load on individual links of a link set coupled to an SSP/SCP.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for monitoring networks, in
particular communications signalling networks.In modern communications technology it has become common practice to provide
two related but separate network infrastructures: a transmission network for carrying end-user
data traffic, and a signalling network for controlling operation of the transmission
network in accordance with control signals transferred through the signalling network. In
practice such signalling networks comprise high-speed computers interconnected by
signalling links; computer programs control the computers to provide a set of operational
and signalling functions in accordance with a standardized protocol. One example of such a
signalling protocol is the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) which is being extensively
deployed for control of telephone and other data transmission networks. An SS7 network
basically comprises various types of signalling points, such as signalling switching points
(SSPs), which include signalling end points (SEPs) associated for example with respective
end stations in the transmission network, and service control points (SCPs), all
interconnected via signalling links by signalling transfer points (STPs).The large size and complexity of data transmission networks entails a
correspondingly large and complex signalling network, controlled by very sophisticated
computer programs. The complexity of signalling networks is increased by the need to
provide redundancy to ensure that failure of a single component of the network does not
cause failure of the entire network, and thus of the associated transmission network. Thus,
for example, it is common in an SS7 network to provide each SSP or SCP with at least two
signalling links connected to respective ones of a pair of geographically-separated STPs.It has been found that, despite or because of this complexity, in certain
circumstances changes and/or failures of components in a signalling network can cause
serious malfunctions of the signalling network, and in extreme cases can result in complete
failure of the signalling network and its associated transmission network. The complexity
and speed of operation of the signalling network can make detection and cure of the fault
very difficult.It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for at least
ameliorating this problem.The paper "Minimum-cost dimensioning model for common channel signaling
