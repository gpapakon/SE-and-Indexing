<ABSTRACT>
This device includes a delay element applying delays to signals received in an optical form, this form being that of a carrier wave of optical nature bearing these signals. These delays are controlled in order to ensure synchronisation of these signals to reference instants. According to the invention, this delay element (2) receives the said carrier wave and applies the said controlled delays to it so as to delay these signals while leaving them in their optical form.

Synchronization apparatus for an optical communications network, the
apparatus receiving firstly signals to be synchronized, the signals being

received in an optical form, and secondly reference instants, and including:

a delay member (2) applying controlled delays to the signals to be
synchronized so that the signals are synchronized on the reference instants

while leaving the signals to be synchronized in their optical form; and
a control device (54, 60, 62) for controlling the delay member (2) which
device includes:


a signal input (52) for receiving an optical-type carrier wave
carrying signals to be transmitted, the signals constituting information signals

and having respective characteristic instants, the characteristic instants
succeeding one another at time intervals;
a recognition member (54) receiving a fraction of said carrier
wave, for recognizing and supplying said characteristic instants;
said delay member (2) for applying controlled delays to the
signals;
an output (56) for receiving and transmitting the signals delayed
by said delay member;
a time reference input (58) for receiving reference signals
carrying reference instants, the reference instants succeeding one another at

time intervals that are not greater than those of said characteristic instants, so
that each of said information signals has a time offset which is the time

between its characteristic instant and the following reference instant; and
a comparator (62) receiving said characteristic instants and said
reference instants, and supplying, for each of said signals to be transmitted, a

selection signal representing the time offset of the signal, the comparator (62)
controlling said delay member (2) via said selection signal so as to cause the

delay member to delay each signal to be transmitted by a time equal to its
time offset so that each of said characteristic instants is caused to coincide

with one of said reference instants,
said apparatus being 
characterized by
 the fact that said delay member
includes a semiconductive substrate (2) incorporating a planar optical path

(1), which path includes:

an input (30.0) for receiving said carrier wave;
outputs (30.1, ..., 30.N), each output enabling an output fraction of the
wave to be output; and 
a first waveguide (10.1) for guiding the wave from said input to a first
output (30.1), a second waveguide (10.2) for guiding a remaining fraction of

the wave from the first output to a second output (30.2), a third waveguide
(10.3) for guiding a remaining fraction from the second output to a third output

(30.3), and so on to a last output (30.N), at least some of said waveguides
including amplifiers (20.1, ..., 20N) for maintaining the power of the carrier

wave;
said substrate (2) further incorporating a selection member (64) for
selecting one of said outputs (30.1, ..., 30.N) of said optical path on

command, and for connecting the selected output to said output (56) of the
processor.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact that said
comparator (62) supplies each of said selection signals in a binary encoded

form constituted by a succession of S selection bits that collectively define a
value of the signal and that are supplied via respective outputs (62.1, ..., 62.5)

of the comparator, said selection member (64) being in the form of a matrix
having N rows (L1, ..., LN) and S columns (C1, ..., CS), each row (such as L3)

being constituted by an optical waveguide connecting a respective output
(such as 30.3) of said optical path to the output (56) of said apparatus via a

concentrator (66), each row including, in series, a succession of optical gates
(such as P3.1, ..., P3.S), each of which can be opened or closed so that each

row is open if all of its gates are open, and each row is closed if at least one
of its gates is closed, each of said optical gates being controlled in binary form

by receiving a bit and by being adapted to respond to zero bits or to one bits
so as to be open only when it receives a zero bit or so as to be open only

when it receives a one bit, each column (such as C3.S) of said matrix being
fed via a respective output (62.S) of said comparator (62), and feeding, in

parallel, a succession of N of said optical gates (such as P1S, ..., PNS) via
one of said selection bits, the succession of N optical gates belonging to

respective ones of the N rows, the adaptations of said optical gates showing
up a respective correspondence between said rows and the values of said

selection signal, each of said rows being the only one to be opened by a
selection signal whose value has said correspondence with the row.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact that it further
includes a reference generator (60) receiving clock pulses (67, 68) and 

counting them so as to respond by supplying said reference instants to said
comparator (62).
