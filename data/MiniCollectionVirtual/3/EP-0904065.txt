 JMICROENCAPSULATED FRAGRANCES AND METHOD FOR PREPARATION This invention relates to an encapsulated fragrance in which the fragrance is controlled can be released by exposing the encapsulated fragrance to a solution of a predetermined pH. The invention also contemplates a process for preparing encapsulated fragrances.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere are numerous uses for a system which can release a fragrance in a controlled manner. These include the use of fragrances in substrates such as air fresheners, laundry detergents, fabric softeners, deodorants, lotions, and other household items. However, the design of a system that will release a fragrance over a period of time under repeatable predetermined conditions, has proved difficult. One problem in achieving such a design is that fragrances are generally essential oils that are composed of a plurality of compounds, each present in different quantities. Thus, it is difficult to predict how the quantity of each component of the essential oil will effect the release characteristics of the system.U.S. Patent No. 4,587,129 describes a method for preparing gel articles which contain up to 90% by weight of fragrance or perfume oils. The gels are prepared from a polymer having a hydroxy (lower alkoxy) 2-alkeneoate, a hydroxy 

(lower alkoxy) lower alkyl 2-alkeneoate, or a hydroxy poly (lower alkoxy) lower alkyl 2-alkeneoate and a polyethylenically unsaturated crosslinking agent. These materials are said to have continuous slow release properties, i.e. , they release the fragrance component continuously over a long period of time. However, a drawback of the invention is that the release of the fragrance from the gels is continuous and cannot be controlled. Thus, the fragrance can be exhausted while the product in which it is contained is on the shelf, e.g. , in storage, prior to use by the consumer.A composition that functions to hold a fragrance until it is desirable to release the fragrance and then functions to release the fragrance over an extended period of time would be desirable. Thus, an object of this invention is to provide a composition which retains a fragrance until the desired time for release.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe subject invention provides compositions comprising a polymer and a fragrance, wherein said polymer comprises an acrylic acid copolymer. The acrylic acid copolymer comprises an acrylic acid monomer having the formula:wherein R1, R2, and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl; and at
