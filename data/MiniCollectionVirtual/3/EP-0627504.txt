<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling electrolytic 
silver recovery for two film processing machines which enables the fixing 

baths to be connected with a silver recovery unit according to their 
level of silver concentration. According to the invention, the silver concentration 

in a fixing bath having a liquid connection with the silver 
recovery unit and in an unconnected fixing bath is continually calculated 

by electronic means and a control signal is generated when the difference 
in silver concentration between the connected and the unconnected fixing 

baths reaches a pre-definable level, said control signal causing actuators 
to connect the silver recovery unit with the fixing bath having the higher 

concentration of silver. When the silver concentration reaches a pre-definable 
level an electrolysing current in the silver recovery unit is switched 

on and remains switched on until the silver concentration falls below the 
pre-defined level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling electrolytic 
silver recovery for two film processing machines whereby the silver 
concentration is determined with the aid of the photo-sensitive surfaces 
which pass through the treatment baths of the film processing machines 
and used as the basis for connecting the fixing baths with a silver recovery 
unit. Methods of this type, in which a processing machine transmits a signal 
which is proportional to the developed area of film and therefore also to 
the amount of silver passed into the fixing bath, are well known. With regard to electrolytic silver recovery for a film processing machine, 
it is known from DE-B 1 188 822 that the level of recovery is controlled 
by switching the electrolysing current on and off according to the quantity 
of the photographic material passing through the fixing bath. On-line fixing bath regeneration systems for one to three processing 
machines, in which the fixing bath fluids are continuously fed via connecting 
pipes into an electrolytic silver extraction unit, where the silver is 
removed, and then fed back into the fixing baths, are known. (Brochure 
of the company H. Stamm KG/1991). The electrolysing current is controlled 
in the familiar manner by signals which are proportional to the silver concentration 
level of the fluid mixture formed in the recovery unit which is 
either measured by sensors placed at that point or determined on the 
basis of the area of film passing through the fixing baths. The "Ecosys F 08" on-line apparatus for two processing machines produced 
by the company Agfa-Gevaert AG performs fixing bath regeneration 
in a similar manner.  
 The disadvantage of these methods is the fact that silver extraction for 
each individual fixing bath is not performed on the basis of the amount of 
silver passing into the fixing bath, which is relative to the area of film 
passed through each bath. Optimum silver extraction of each separate fixing 
bath according to its silver concentration level at any one time is 
therefore not possible. Another disadvantage lies in the fact that if the amount of silver passing 
into each fixing bath varies significantly, a fixing solution mixture is 
formed in the silver recovery unit whose overall silver concentration is 
lower than the concentration in the fixing bath with the higher film 
throughput. Since equal electrolysing currents will achieve higher silver 
recovery rates with higher silver concentrations than with lower concentrations, 
rapid

<CLAIMS>
Method for controlling electrolytic recovery of silver for two film processing 
machines involving the calculation of the silver concentration 

levels on the basis of the area of photo-sensitive material passing 
through the treatment baths of the film processing machines and use 

of the said concentration levels as the basis for connecting the fixing 
baths with a silver recovery unit, 
characterized
 in that the silver 
concentration levels in a fixing bath having a liquid connection with 

the silver recovery unit and in an unconnected fixing bath are continually 
calculated by electronic means, and in that when a pre-definable 

difference in silver concentration between the connected and 
unconnected fixing baths is reached, a control signal is generated 

which causes actuators to connect the silver recovery unit with the 
fixing bath having the higher silver concentration level, the electrolysing 

current being switched on when the silver concentration level 
reaches a pre-definable level and remaining switched on until the said 

concentration level falls below the said pre-defined level. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized
 by the fact that if, 
for a pre-definable period, the silver concentration remains below the 

level required to switch on the electrolysing current and the difference 
in silver concentration between the fixing baths remains below 

the pre-defined level, the silver recovery unit is connected alternately 
with each fixing bath for a pre-definable period. 
Apparatus for performing the method of claims 1 or 2, in which for recovering silver 
from the fixing baths (10a and 10b) of two film processing machines 

are provided an outflow pipe (6) and a return pipe (7) forming a 
liquid connection with a silver recovery unit (1), and also an arrangement 

of valves, 
characterized
 in that the valve arrangement consists 
of a valve (9a and 9b) in each of the outflow and return pipes (6 

and 7), said valves being controllable by electronic means (3) for 
selectively connecting one of the fixing baths (10a and 10b) with the 

silver recovery unit (1).
