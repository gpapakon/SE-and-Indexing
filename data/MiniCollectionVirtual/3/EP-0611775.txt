<ABSTRACT>
The synthesis of useful peptides presents a promising 
approach to new therapeutic agents. The Dolastatins, 

a series of linear and cyclic antineoplastic and/or 
cytostatic peptides isolated from Indian Ocean sea 

hare 
Dolabella auricularia
 represent excellent leads 
for synthetic modification. 
In the present invention, the corresponding amine was 
allowed to react with Boc-L-phenylalanine. Synthesis 

of amides led to excellent yields; The protecting 
group of amides was removed with hydrogen chloride in 

acetic acid to afford the hydrochloride salt, The 
correspondent deprotected 
N
-
tert
-butyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanineamide 
was coupled with dolaproine in the 

presence of diethyl phosphorocyanidate and 
triethylamine thereby yielding dipeptideamides. The 

protecting groups of amides was removed with 
trifluoroacetic acid to afford the trifluoroacetate 

salt. Diethyl phosphorocyanidate was used again with 
excellent results for coupling tripeptide 

trifluoroacetate with each of the amide salts to 
yield Dolastatin 10 structural modifications. 
The extraordinary inhibition of cell growth shown by 
the Pentapeptideamides against six major types of 

human cancer has been presented. The intermediates 
of these reaction also show anticancer activity 

against the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell 

line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
antineoplastic compounds and more particularly to the 
synthesis of pentapeptide amides exhibiting 
antineoplastic effects. Ancient marine invertebrate species of the Phyla 
Bryozoa, Molluska, and Porifera have been well 
established in the oceans for over one billion years. 
Such organisms have undergone trillions of 
biosynthetic reactions of their evolutionary 
chemistry to reach their present level of cellular 
organization, regulation and defense. For example, marine sponges have changed minimally in 
physical appearance for nearly 500 million years. 
This suggests a very effective chemical resistance to 
evolution in response to changing environmental 
conditions over that period of time. Recognition of 
the potential for utilizing this biologically potent 
marine animal for medicinal purposes was recorded in 
Egypt about 2,700 BC and by 200 BC sea hare extracts 
were being used in Greece for their curative affect. 
This consideration along with the observation that 
marine animals, e.g. invertebrates and sharks, rarely 
develop cancer led to the systematic investigation of 
marine animal and plant anticancer compounds. By 1968 ample evidence had been obtained, based on 
the U.S. National Cancer Institute's (NCI) key  
 
experimental cancer study systems, that certain 
marine organisms could provide new and antineoplastic 
and/or cytotoxic agents and might also lead to 
compounds which would be effective in the control 
and/or eradication of viral diseases. Further, these marine organisms were believed to 
possess potentially useful drug candidates of 
unprecedented structure which had eluded discovery by 
other methods of medicinal chemistry. Fortunately, 
these expectations have been realized, e.g. the 
discovery of the bryostatins, dolastatins and 
cephalostatins, many of which are now in preclinical 
development or human clinical studies. Those researchers presently involved in medicinal 
chemistry know well the time lag between the 
isolation of a new compound and its introduction to 
the market. Often this procedure takes several years 
and may take decades. As a result, industry, in 
association with the U.S. Government, has developed 
a system of testing criteria which serves two 
purposes. One is to eliminate those substances which 
are shown through testing to be economically 
counterproductive. The second, more important 
purpose serves to identify those compounds which 
demonstrate a high likelihood of success and 
therefore warrant the
