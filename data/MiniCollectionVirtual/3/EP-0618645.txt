<ABSTRACT>
A terminal position assurance system is provided 
for an electrical connector (10,14) which includes a 

dielectric housing (18,50) having a terminal-receiving 
passage (24,74) into which a terminal (12,16) is inserted 

in an insertion direction (A,B) to a fully inserted 
position. A latch surface (22b,76b) is formed in the 

housing adjacent the passage and facing in the insertion 
direction. A bendable tab (42,72) is provided on the 

terminal and is adapted to be bent against the latch 
surface. The bendable tab is structured to be bent about 

an axis (46,80) generally parallel to the insertion 
direction to move an edge portion (42a,72a) of the tab to 

a position over the latch surface when the terminal is in 
its fully inserted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector of the
kind referred-to in the preamble to claim 1, and to a method
of ensuring proper positioning of a female terminal.An electrical terminal of that kind is disclosed in US-A-5
147 228. US-A-3 178 672 shows bending of tabs to fix a
connector in a wall structure.Terminal position assurance systems heretofore employed in
electrical connectors often require the use of a separate
component to provide the terminal positioning assurance. In
other words, after terminals are inserted into terminal-receiving
passages in a connector housing, a separate
component is inserted into an opening or openings in the
housing which communicates with the terminal-receiving
passages. In essence, this separate component provides a
secondary lock on the terminals as well as some indication
that all of the terminals are in their proper positions.Problems are encountered with the use of separate terminal
position assurance components in that they are more
susceptible to leakage or arc tracking. In addition, because
of the additional separate components, a user of such
systems must maintain an inventory of not only the connector
housings and the terminals, but also the separate terminal
position assurance or locking components. The potential of
leakage or arc tracking is created because the separate
components require an opening in the housing for access to a
portion of a terminal. This invention is directed to solving the above problems and
providing an improved terminal position assurance system
which does not require separate locking components and, in
fact, uses an integral portion of each terminal as a
secondary locking feature which provides the terminal
position assurance system. The integral portion herein is
provided by a bendable tab.Bendable tabs have been used heretofore for locking
terminals in respective terminal-receiving passages within
connector housings. However, such prior art bendable tabs
have not been capable of providing a terminal positioning
assurance system.More particularly, the bendable tabs of the prior art are
generally planar and are bent about axes or fold lines which
are generally perpendicular to the insertion direction of
the terminals. Such bendable tabs are bent to overlie
locking surfaces of the connector housing adjacent the
terminal-receiving passages. In other words, the tabs are
bent about axes or fold lines generally parallel to such
surfaces. Consequently, a particular terminal might not be
fully inserted into its respective

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (10, 14) which includes a
dielectric housing (18, 50) having a wall (22, 76) with

a terminal-receiving passage (24, 74) therethrough, the
wall defining first (22a, 76a) and second (22b, 76b)

surfaces, a terminal (12, 16) adapted to be received in
the passage with a mating portion (26, 54) on one side

of the wall and a terminating portion (28, 56) on the
other side of the wall, stop means (40, 54a) on the

terminal for engaging a stop surface (22a, 77a) of the
housing to prevent the terminal from passing completely

through the passage in an insertion direction toward the
first surface and to define a fully inserted position of

the terminal, and a bendable tab (42, 74) on the
terminal and adapted to be bent against the second

surface (22b, 76b) of the wall when the terminal is
inserted into the passage, characterized in that said

mating terminal portion (26, 54) has a forward end, said
stop means (40, 54a) located at said forward end and

said bendable tab (42, 72) located at said forward end
are structured to be bent about an axis (46, 80)

perpendicular to the second surface (22b, 76b) of the
wall and are to be positioned over the second surface

when the terminal is fully positioned in the passage.
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said second surface (22b, 76b) is generally flat

and said tab (42, 72) is generally planar.
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 2,
wherein said tab (42, 72) has an edge (42a, 72a)

generally perpendicular to said axis (46, 80) and is
adapted for lockingly engaging the second surface (22b,

76b) when the tab is bent about the axis.
The electrical connector as set forth in claim 1, 
wherein said terminal mating portion (54) is female

forming a generally rectangular cross section adapted to
receive a male blade terminal.
A method of ensuring proper positioning of a female
terminal (12, 16) having a generally rectangular cross

section defining a terminal mating cavity having a
longitudinal axis in a dielectric housing (18, 50) of an

electrical connector (10, 14), the housing having a
terminal-receiving passage (24, 74) into which the

terminal is inserted in an insertion direction (A, C) to
a fully inserted position, comprising the steps of:

providing a latch surface (22b, 76b) on the housing
adjacent the passage and facing in said insertion

direction;

providing a bendable tab (42, 72) on the terminal, the
tab being bendable about an axis (46, 80) generally

parallel to said insertion direction from a first
position aligned with said passage to a second position

over the latch surface;
inserting the terminal into the passage in said
insertion direction to said fully inserted position;
inserting an elongated blade like tool into said
terminal mating cavity; and
beinding said tab from said first position to said
second position by moving the tool (86) about its

longitudinal axis generally while the tool axis is
congruent with the longitudinal axis of the terminal

mating cavity.
