<ABSTRACT>
A polyester film has a surface layer 
whose major component is polyester A. Protrusions are 

formed on the film surface originating from the 
crystallization of polyester A. The number of protrusions 

formed on the surface of the film is not less than 5 x 
10³/mm², and the ratio N 
R
 of the number of protrusions to 
the number of particles contained in a surface layer forming 

the surface of the film is not less than 5. Since most 
or all of the protrusions are formed by utilizing the crystallization 

of polyester A without relying upon the addition of particles, 

generation of voids can be prevented and fine and uniform 
protrusions having excellent chipping resistance and scratch 

resistance can be formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester film and a
process for producing it, and more particularly to a
polyester film wherein fine protrusions are formed on its
surface and a process for producing it.Polyester films are broadly used in various uses.
Better surface characteristics such as further improved
running ability, abrasion resistance and so forth have been
required for polyester films in order to meet with the
increasing speed of a film processing process, for example,
a printing process in use for wrapping films, a magnetic
layer applying process in use for magnetic recording media,
or a thermosensible layer applying process in use for
thermosensible films, or in order to meet with higher
quality requirements for final products. It is known that
it is effective to uniformly form fine protrusions on the
surface of a film to obtain a good running ability.With respect to formation of such fine protrusions on
the surface of a film, a polyester film containing
substantially spherical silica particles originating from
colloidal silica is known and described in, for example, JP-A- 59-171623.
Further, a polyester film, wherein a thin
layer containing particles to form surface protrusions is
laminated on a base layer, is also known and described in, 
for example, JP-A- 2-77431.In the conventional polyester films such as above
wherein protrusions are formed on the film surface by
containing particles (for example, inert particles),
however, basically there are the following problems.A problem associated with the formation of protrusions by including
particles which has been especially difficult to solve is that, because
the particles present are foreign materials relative to
polyester, voids (cracks, cavities) are likely to be
generated around the particles by stretching the film. Such
voids cause various disadvantages, for example, deterioration of
transparency and reduction of dielectric breakdown voltage
in use for capacitors. Further, in a base film for a
magnetic recording medium, chipping of the surface of the
film is liable to occur because protrusions formed on the
film surface become brittle. Particularly, in use for a
magnetic tape, a base film has been required to be further
highly oriented by a higher draw ratio in stretching from
the requirement of a higher elastic modulus for the base
film. Therefore, problems such as chipping of film surface due
to generation of voids have become intensified.US-3 967 025 discloses a process in which a polyester film
is subjected to differential
