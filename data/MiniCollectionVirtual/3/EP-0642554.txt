<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact resistant and ignition resistant
composition based on a major portion of a carbonate polymer, a minor portion of a rubber-modified
monovinylidene aromatic copolymer, and an optional amount of a rubbery core/shell
graft copolymer impact modifier. In these resin blends, excellent combinations of properties
have been obtained using as the ignition resistance additives a metal salt of an aromatic sulfur
compound, a buffering free aromatic sulfur compound, an organophosphorus compound and
a tetrafluoroethylene polymer.It is well known that blends of a carbonate polymer and a monovinylidene
aromatic copolymer, such as an ABS-type resin, can be prepared possessing desirable
combinations of physical properties. These thermoplastic polymer blends are suitable for the
manufacture of molded parts wherein impact strength, rigidity, toughness, heat resistance,
and excellent electrical properties are required. However, it is usually desired to incorporate
sufficient ignition resisting additives in such blends to enable the resin blend compositions to
obtain the V-0 rating (1.62 millimeter or 1/16 inch samples) or 5V rating (3.18 millimeter or 1/8
inch samples) in the well known Underwriters Laboratory test referred to as UL 94.In this regard, however, it has unfortunately been found that there are various
disadvantages or tradeoffs that are observed when attempting to incorporate sufficient
amounts of many of the known ignition resisting additives. Often one or more of the additives
is found to cause degradation of one of the polymeric components, especially the carbonate
polymer. In addition, if large amounts of the additive are required, the desirable physical
properties of the resin blend are diluted by the typically undesirable physical properties of the
additive compound. Moreover, some additives have chemical characteristics and/or processing
characteristics that result in poor performance of the resin blend or parts prepared from the
resin blend in one or more aspects in the broad range of applications and processing
equipment types wherein these types of resins can be employed.There have already been numerous efforts, as indicated in the literature, to
provide ignition resistant carbonate polymer blends which are essentially halogen-free. Early
efforts to provide halogen-free ignition resistant carbonate polymers or carbonate polymer
blends have typically failed to provide sufficient combinations of ignition resistance,
toughness, processability, and stability. See
