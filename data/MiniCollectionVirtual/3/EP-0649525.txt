<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for the
detection of surface defects especially on cylindrical
objects such as nuclear fuel pellets.Certain cylindrical objects such as nuclear fuel
pellets have to meet very demanding manufacturing quality
specifications. Such objects may be manufactured by an
automated manufacturing route without handling by human
operators and in such a route it will be necessary to
inspect the objects for surface defects using automatic
apparatus. The objects may for example be sintered
cylindrical UO2 (uranium dioxide) pellets for a so-called
"agr" fuel element. Such pellets have an axial hole or
bore provided for fuel performance reasons. The sintered
pellets are inserted in stainless steel cladding tubes,
the tubes being sealed to form a fuel pin and a cluster of
pins being assembled to form fuel elements. The pellets
require automatic inspection before insertion in the
cladding tubes.In the prior art apparatus described in US-A-4 226 539, cyclindrical objects are checked for defects in the cylindrical surface, then turned through 90Â° while still on their sides, for inspection of both ends simultaneously.The invention seeks to provide a more reliable inspection apparatus for such objects.According to the present invention there is provided
an apparatus for the detection of surface defects on
cylindrical objects which includes means for conveying the
objects to be inspected one-by-one each on its end to a
first inspection station, means for inspecting the free
end of each object as it passes through the first
inspection station, means for conveying the objects one-by-one
each on its side to a second inspection station the
means including means for tipping the objects from their
ends to their sides, means for rotating each object whilst
passing it on its side through the second inspection
station, means for inspecting the curved surface of each
object as it passes through the second inspection station,
means for conveying the objects one-by-one to a third
inspection station the said means including means for
tipping the objects onto their end inspected at the first
inspection station and means for inspecting the free end 
of each object as it passes through the third inspection
station.Unlike prior art systems the apparatus according to
the present invention allows all surfaces excepting the
surface in the bore if present of the cylindrical objects
to be inspected in a continuous operation the objects
being presented one-by-one to the apparatus by a conveying
means.The

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the detection of surface defects on
cylindrical objects which includes means for conveying the

objects to be inspected one-by-one each on its end to a
first inspection station, means for inspecting the free

end of each object as it passes through the first
inspection station, means for conveying the objects one-by-one

each on its side to a second inspection station the
means including means for tipping the objects from their

ends to their sides, means for rotating each object whilst
passing it on its side through the second inspection

station, means for inspecting the curved surface of each
object as it passes through the second inspection station,

means for conveying the objects one-by-one to a third
inspection station the said means including means for

tipping the objects onto their end inspected at the first
inspection station and means for inspecting the free end

of each object as it passes through the third inspection
station.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 and wherein the means for
tipping the objects between the first and second

inspection stations includes a first tipping station
comprising a step on the conveying means the step being

adapted change the attitude of the axes of the objects
from vertical to horizontal and the means for tipping the

objects between the second and third inspection stations
includes a second tipping station comprising a shaped step

on the conveying means the step being adapted to change
the attitude of the axes of the objects from horizontal to

vertical.
Apparatus as in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and wherein the
means for inspecting the curved surface comprises means

for scanning an optical beam along the objects when at the
second inspection station and first detector means for

detecting a reflected beam comprising reflections of the 
scanned beam by each translating and rotating cylindrical

object inspected by the scanned beam.
Apparatus as in Claim 1, Claim 2 or Claim 3 and
wherein the means for inspecting the curved surface

additionally includes a second detector means for
detecting a transmitted beam comprising transmission of

the scanned beam when it does not impinge upon the object.
Apparatus as in Claim 4 and including one or more
mirrors to direct the transmitted beam onto the second

detector means.
Apparatus as in Claim 3 and including a signal
processor for comparing the signal detected by the first

detector means with a reference signal.
Apparatus as in Claim 4 or Claim 5 and wherein the
signal processor is also adapted to compare the signal by

the second detector means with a reference signal.
Apparatus as in any one of the preceding Claims and
wherein the means for rotating each object whilst passing

on its side through the second inspection station
comprises a continuous belt and means for moving the belt

over two spaced apart guides, one guide being at a higher
vertical position than the other whereby the upper surface

of the belt is inclined relative to the vertical and
horizontal axes, and a guide bar running close to and

across the upper surface of the belt, whereby when objects
are positioned on the belt immediately above the guide bar

they traverse the belt in contact with the guide bar
whilst being rotated on their own axis by the movement of

the belt.
Apparatus as in any one of the preceding Claims and
wherein the means for inspecting the free end of each

object at either or both of the first inspection station
and the third inspection station comprises a gauge which

capacitively senses the gap between the gauge and the
object as the object passes the gauge. 
Apparatus as in any one of Claims 1 to 8 and wherein
the means for inspecting the free end of each object at

either or both of the first inspection station and the
third inspection station includes means for irradiating

the end surface of the object, detector means for
detecting radiation reflected by the end surface

substantially parallel to the axis of the object and
calculator means for calculating the proportion of the end

surface which has reflected radiation directly to the
detector means.
Apparatus as in any one of the preceding Claims and
wherein one or more of the first, second and third

inspection stations includes one or more means for
detecting the presence of an object close to the

inspection station providing in use an output signal to
energise the means for inspection whereby that means is

energised only when the object is at the inspection
station.
