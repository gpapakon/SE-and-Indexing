<ABSTRACT>
In a coal gasification power generator, a coal gas 500 
obtained by gasifying a coal 100 by a gasifying furnace 1 is 

introduced into a desulfurization furnace 2 in which the coal 
gas 500 is desulfurized by a limestone 400. A coal gas 501 

after desulfurization is burned by a combuster 5 after it has 
passed through a dust removing unit 3 so that a high 

temperature combustion gas 800 is supplied to a gas turbine 7. 
The gas turbine 7 drives a power generating unit. An exhaust 

gas 801 from the gas turbine 7 is supplied to an exhaust gas 
boiler 8. A char 60a produced in the gasifying furnace 1 and 

a limestone 60b containing CaS emitted from the desulfurization 
furnace 2 are burned in an oxidation furnace 4, and by using 

the resultant combustion gas, a water vapor 30a introduced from 
the exhaust gas boiler 8 is heated by a heat exchanger 10, and 

thereafter it is supplied to the gasifying furnace 1 as a gas 
700. With the above construction, chemical energy possessed by 

the coal 100 is effectively converted into electric energy, and 
also the rate of desulfurization of coal gasifying gas is 

improved thereby reducing emitted sulfur oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coal gasification power generator as defined by the features of the preamble of claim 1, for 
generating power by use of a gas fuel such as gasified coal. Coal is of importance as a fuel for power generation 
now and in the future since there are a lot of coal-reserves, 
and the coal reserves are hardly unevenly distributed over the 
world. It is required to reduce the emission of the materials 
such as SOx, NOx, or CO2 from a power plant which generates 
power by using coal as a fuel, which adversely affect the 
global environment, and also to improve the efficiency of power 
generation. To satisfy such requirements, a coal gasification 
power generator, a power generator of the pressurized fluidized 
bed combustion boiler type and the like have been developed in 
lieu of a conventional pulverized coal boiler. As one of those 
developing power generators, there has been proposed a power 
generator using a fluidized bed coal gasifying furnace. One 
example of the conventional power generator is shown in Fig. 6. 
This conventional power generator has been proposed by British 
Coal Corporation in Great Britain, and will be described with 
reference to Fig. 6. A coal 100, a limestone 400, an air 203 and a water 
vapor 300 are supplied to a coal gasifying furnace 1'. The  
 
coal 100 is gasified in the coal gasifying furnace 1'. H2S and 
COS in the resultant generated gas are reacted with the 
limestone 400 and fixed as CaS in the limestone 400. A coal gas 500 generated from the coal gasifying 
furnace 1' is dust-removed by a dust removing unit 3. A coal 
gas 501 which has been subjected to dust removal is introduced 
in a combuster 5. Char which has not been gasified in the coal 
gasifying furnace 1' and particles 60b of the limestone 400 
after the above reaction are extracted from the coal gasifying 
furnace 1' and then transferred to a hopper 17. Particles 60c 
retrieved from a coal gas 550 by means of a gas filter 3 which 
constitutes a dust removing unit is transferred to the hopper 
17. An air 200 is pressurized by an air compressor 6 to 
produce a pressurized air 201. A pressurized air 204, which is 
a part of the pressurized air 201, is supplied to the combuster 
5. The gas 501 is burned by the combuster 5 by application of 
the pressurized air 204, thereby generating a gas turbine inlet 
gas 800. A gas turbine 7 is driven by the gas turbine inlet 
gas 800 to produce a gas turbine outlet gas 801 having normal 
pressure. The gas turbine 7 drives the air compressor
