<ABSTRACT>
Device for sports training and/or the rehabilitation (reeducation) of people in water (an aquatic medium), characterised in that it comprises a pool (10), equipped with means (16) for circulating the water so as to create a current in a given direction, and a movable floor (12), equipped with means (14) for displacement in terms of height and for blocking this floor in any intermediate position, between a high position located at least in line with the lip (curb, coping) of the pool and a low position lying substantially flat at the bottom of the pool, these displacement and blocking means being arranged outside this pool.

Apparatus for sports training and/or rehabilitation 
of people in an aquatic medium, of the type comprising a 

pool (10) equipped with means (16) for circulating the 
water so as to create a current in a given direction and 

a movable floor (12) equipped with means (14) located 
outside the pool for moving said floor vertically and 

for locking it in position, characterised in that these 
displacing and locking means (14) enable the floor (12) 

to be placed in any intermediate position between an 
upper position located at least level with the pool edge 

(11) and a lower position substantially lying on the 
bottom of the pool, and in that these displacing and 

locking means (14) comprise two pairs of elbowed arms 
(26) articulated relative to the edge of the pool at one 

of their ends and fitted with support members (30) which 
are provided in order to co-operate with the floor (12) 

at the other end and elevating means (32) arranged 
between a fixed support and the arms. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the current is a laminar current on the surface at 

a given height, which is oriented along the longitudinal 
axis of the pool. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the upper position of the floor is located above 

the pool edge so as to give access to the entire pool. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the elevating means comprise, for 

each of the arms (26), a jack (32) the body of which is 
rotatably articulated about a fixed spindle (38) 

perpendicular to the direction of movement of the piston 
of this jack, the free end of this piston being jointed  

 
to the corresponding arm. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the jacks (32) are electric jacks fitted with 

bearings. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that it comprises travel limit indicators (40, 42 and 

44) arranged on either side of the body (36) of the jack 
so that they are actuated during the pivoting of the 

body of the jack about the fixed spindle (38), at angles 
which correspond to the upper and lower positions. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that it comprises a third travel limit indicator (44) 

which is actuated by the body (36) of the jack when the 
upper position indicator is disengaged, said third 

indicator corresponding to the position of the floor 
above the pool edge for access to the entire pool. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in th
at the floor (24) is articulated, on 
the one hand, at the ends of the arms of one of the 

pairs (26), with translational locking, and supported, 
on the other hand, by the arms of the second pair with 

free translational movement. 
Autonomous apparatus for sports training and/or 
rehabilitation according to any one of the preceding 

claims, characterised in that it further comprises a 
support frame resting on a base, in which are integrated 

the pool (10) and the water circulating means (16) 
thereof, water-treatment means (46), the arms and the 

floor (24), the elevating means (26), the pool edge (11) 
and the surround (13) of the pool.
