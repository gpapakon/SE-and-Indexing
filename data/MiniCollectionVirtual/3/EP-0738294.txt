<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for making a cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structure of an ethylenic polymer material of a cross-linked, substantially linear ethylenic polymer. The substantially linear ethylenic polymer has in an un-crosslinked state: (a) a melt flow ratio, I10/I2  
>
/=  5.63; (b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, defined by the equation: Mw/Mn  
<
/=  (I10/I2) - 4.63; and (c) a critical shear rate at onset of surface melt fracture of at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a linear ethylenic polymer having about the same I2 and Mw/Mn. Further disclosed is a process for making the above foam structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for manufacturing a
cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structure having enhanced processability and physical
properties.Commercially-available, cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam structures (XLPE) are
typically made with conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) resins made by high pressure
processes. LDPE resins have found favor because of their relatively low melt temperatures and
desirable processability.It would be desirable to have an XLPE foam structure with enhanced strength and
resiliency, yet retain the low foam density and desirable resin processability afforded by the use
of LDPE resins. One means of enhancing strength and resiliency is to employ a conventional
linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), a copolymer of ethylene and a C4-10 alpha-olefin.
Unfortunately, LLDPE resin is difficult to process and to a XLPE foam, and results in a relatively
high density foam structure with poor quality. It would be desirable to have an XLPE foam
structure similar in strength and resiliency to an XLPE foam structure of LLDPE while comprising
a resin having in an un-crosslinked state processability similar to an LDPE resin.
The process according to the present invention leads to a cross-linked ethylenic polymer foam
structure of an ethylenic polymer material of a cross-linked, substantially linear ethylenic
polymer. The substantially linear ethylenic polymer used in the process has in an un-crosslinked state a: a) a melt
flow ratio, I10/I2, ≥ 5.63; b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn from 1,5 to 2,5;
and c) from 0.01 to 3 long chain branches/1000 carbons.
The foam structure is strong, resilient,
and of low density. The structure has high strength and resiliency similar to that of a foam
structure comprised of cross-linked LLDPE, and has low density and quality similar to that of a
foam structure of cross-linked LDPE.According to the present invention, there is a process for making a cross-linked
ethylenic polymer foam structure. First, a foamable melt polymer material is formed by
blending and heating a decomposable chemical blowing agent and an ethylenic polymer
material comprising a substantially ethylenic polymer having: a) a melt flow ratio, I10/I2, ≥
5.63; b) a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn from 1.5 to 2.5;
and c) from 0.01 to 3 long chain branches/1000 carbons.
Second, cross-linking is induced in the foamable melt 
polymer material. Third, the foamable melt polymer material is expanded by exposing it to an
elevated temperature to form the foam
