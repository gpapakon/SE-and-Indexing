<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of toner compositions comprising 

(i) preparing a pigment dispersion in water, which dispersion comprises 
pigment, a counterionic surfactant with a charge polarity of opposite sign to the ionic 

surfactant of (ii) and optionally a charge control agent; 
(ii) shearing the pigment dispersion with a latex comprised of resin, ionic 
surfactant, nonionic surfactant, and water; and wherein the latex solids content, which 

solids comprise resin, is from about 50 weight percent to about 20 weight percent thereby 
causing a flocculation or heterocoagulation of the formed particles of pigment, resin and 

optional charge control agent; diluting with water to form a dispersion of total solids of 
from about 30 weight percent to 1 weight percent, which total solids comprise resin, 

pigment and optional charge control agent contained in a mixture of said nonionic, ionic 
and counterionic surfactants; 
(iii) heating the above sheared blend at a temperature of from about 5 to 
about 25°C below about the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resin while 

continuously stirring to form toner sized aggregates with a narrow size dispersity; and 
(iv) heating the electrostatically bound aggregated particles at a 
temperature of from about 5 to about 50°C above about the Tg of the resin to provide a 

toner composition comprising resin, pigment and optionally a charge control agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to processes for the preparation of
toner compositions, and more specifically to aggregation and coalescence processes for
the preparation of toner compositions comprised, for example, of toner resins, or
polymers, pigment, and toner additives, such as charge control agents.In reprographic technologies, such as xerographic and ionographic devices,
toners with average volume diameter particle sizes of from about 9 microns to about 20
µm (microns) have been effectively utilized. Moreover, in some xerographic systems, such as the
high volume Xerox Corporation 5090 copier-duplicator, high resolution characteristics and
low image noise are highly desired, and can be attained utilizing the small sized toners of
the present invention with an average volume particle of less than 11 µm (microns), preferably
less than about 7 µm (microns) and more preferably from 1 to about 7 µm (microns), and with narrow
geometric size distribution (GSD) of from about 1.2 to about 1.3. Additionally, in some
xerographic systems wherein process color is utilized such as pictorial color applications,
small particle size colored toners of from about 3 to about 9 µm (microns) are desired to avoid
paper curling. Paper curling is especially observed in pictorial or process color applications
wherein three to four layers of toners are transferred and fused onto paper. During the
fusing step, moisture is driven off from the paper due to the high fusing temperatures of
from about 130 to 160°C applied to the paper from the fuser. Where only one layer of
toner is present such as in black or in highlight xerographic applications, the amount of
moisture driven off during fusing is reabsorbed proportionally by paper and the resulting
print remains relatively flat with minimal curl. In pictorial color process applications
wherein three to four colored toner layers are present, a thicker toner plastic level present
after the fusing step inhibits the paper from sufficiently absorbing the moisture lost during
the fusing step, and image paper curling results. These and other disadvantages and
problems are avoided or minimized with the toners and processes of the present
invention. It is preferable to use small toner particle sizes such as from about 1 to 7
microns and with higher pigment loading such as from about 5 to about 12 percent by
weight of toner, such that the mass of toner layers deposited onto paper is reduced to
obtain the same quality of image and resulting in a thinner plastic toner layer
