<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to coil assemblies and in particular, 
but not exclusively, to such assemblies for acoustic 

transducers. Thus a transducer 10 includes a case 11 in 
which is located a coil 16 mounted on a flexi-circuit, which 

locates the coil 16 for its assembly handing and which 
allows various configurations within the case 11. A method 

of winding the coil 16 and mounting on the carrier 17 is 
also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 
hearing aid transducer and to a hearing aid including such a transducer. In many applications, and particularly in the hearing 
aid industry, there is a need for very small electrical 
coils made of extremely fine wire. These coils have to be 
mounted into cases and the fine input and output wires have 
to be connected to terminals by significantly thicker wires. 
This results in many assembly problems, because the fine 
wire can only be manipulated under a microscope and is very 
liable to break and because, with current winding 
arrangements, there is no certainty where the leads of the 
coil may end up after winding. Another complication is that 
it is generally desirable to produce small coils without any 
internal former and this means that the coil is difficult to 
orientate and locate correctly in three-dimensions. (The 
only reference surfaces are the end faces and the tunnel). DE-A-3616773 describes a hearing aid having an external 
case containing a flexible circuit which interconnects the 
electrical components of the aid and carries some of them. 
The circuit has terminals for the larger components such as 
the microphone. From one aspect the invention consists in a 
hearing aid transducer incorporating a case, a fine 
wire coil disposed within the case and having a set of leads 
and a flexible carrier incorporating electrical paths 
extending from a first set of terminals to a second set of  
 
terminals, the coil being mounted on the carrier and its 
leads being connected to the first set of terminals wherein 
the case has a slot through which the carrier extends such 
that its second set of terminals are external to the case.  
 In a preferred embodiment the carrier is flexible and 
may, for example, be constituted by a flexi-circuit. The 
connections between the leads of the first set of terminals 
are preferably formed by welding or some similar arrangement 
so as to avoid solder flux contamination. Where the carrier is flexible it will be understood 
that the carrier can easily be bent to conform to the shape 
of the case and to pass around other elements of the device 
of which the coil assembly forms a part thus allowing a 
great range of configurations. Thus the carrier may extend 
above the coil or below the coil and its dimensions may be 
selected to locate particularly the coil within the case. 
The carrier may have a variety of second terminal 
configurations to suit the particular company using the 
devices and indeed the second terminals may be in
