<ABSTRACT>
An end cap (10) for a ducted plastics panel (11) 
comprises a channel section member having an intended 

upper side (12) and an intended lower side (16), the 
upper side including a coextruded gasket (20), whereby, 

when the end cap is pushed onto the plastics panel, the 
gasket lies on the panel surface to limit passage of 

water past the gasket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns installation of
roofing panels.Conservatories and like structures can have a
roof structure comprising parallel glazing bars
extending from one or both sides of a ridge member
with glazing panels supported between the glazing
bars. A common glazing material is polycarbonate
sheeting, which may have two or three skins joined at
their edges and intermediate their edges to form
longitudinal ducts through the panels. When such
panels are fitted to a conservatory roof, the ends of
the panels are sealed with a breather tape to prevent
ingress of water into the ducts of the panels. The
ends of the panels are then covered with a simple
polycarbonate cap however, polycarbonate panels are
generally not as flat as glass panes, so that some
ingress of water is still possible between the
polycarbonate panels and their end caps, which
eventually finds its way into the polycarbonate
panels themselves.EP-A-0513934 discloses an end cap for a
glazing panel comprising a channel section with an
upper side having co-extruded gasket material along a
free edge of the upper side and extending inwardly of 
the channel, so as to lie on the glazing panel
surface.DE-U-8601745 discloses channel section end
caps for glazing panels.An object of this invention is to provide a
means for preventing the foresaid ingress of water
into glazing panels of the ducted type.According to the invention, there is provided
an end cap for ducted plastic panels (11), which
comprises a channel section member having an intended
upper side (12) and an intended lower side (16), the
upper side having a co-extruded gasket (20), whereby,
when the end cap is pushed onto a plastics panel, the
gasket lies on the panel surface to limit passage of
water past the gasket, characterized in that the
upper and lower sides of the channel section member
converge over at least part of their length and the
co-extruded gasket extends forwardly from a free edge
of the upper side of the channel section member.Preferably the lower side has its free edge
curving away from the upper side over a part of its
height. The lower side preferably includes weep
holes spaced along its length preferably adjacent to
the base of the channel member. Within the channel
member, there are preferably provided one or more
projections to act as stops for a panel onto which
the end cap is fitted. The projection or projections
preferably extend downwardly from the upper side of 
the wall of the channel member, preferably at right
angles thereto.This invention will now be

An end cap (10) for ducted plastics panels (11),
which comprises a channel section member having an

intended upper side (12) and an intended lower side
(16), the upper side having a co-extruded gasket (20),

whereby, when the end cap is pushed onto a plastics
panel, the gasket lies on the panel surface to limit

passage of water past the gasket, characterized in that
the upper and lower sides of the channel section member

converge over at least part of their length and the co-extruded
gasket extends forwardly from a free edge of

the upper side of the channel section member.
An end cap as claimed in claim 1 characterized in
that the lower side of the channel section member has

its free edge (18) curving away from the upper side over
a part of its height.
An end cap as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lower side includes weep holes

(24) spaced along its length.
An end cap as claimed in claim 3, characterized
in that the weep holes (24) are adjacent to base (14) of

the channel member.
An end cap as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
4, characterized by having within the channel one or

more projections (22) to act as stops for a panel onto 
which the end cap is fitted.
An end cap as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that the projections (22) extend downwardly from the

upper side wall (12) of the channel member.
An end cap as claimed in claim 6, characterized
in that the projections (22) extend at right angles to

the upper side wall (12) of the channel member.
