<ABSTRACT>
In a pair of lever-type connectors, a U-shaped lever (17) 
including a pair of cam portions (22) is rotatably provided in one 

of connector housings of connectors to be connected to each 
other in such a manner that the lever straddles the connector 

housing, a pair of cam receive portions (13) respectively engageable 
with the cam portions (22) are provided in the other connector 

housing, and by rotating the lever reciprocatingly, the cam 
receive portion (13) are shifted so as to connect or disconnect the 

two connectors to and from each other. The lever-type 
connector comprises a pair of lever support shafts (16) provided on 

and projected from one of the one connector housing and the 
lever, a pair of bearing hole portions (24) respectively formed in 

the other of the one connector housing and the lever and 
engageable with the lever support shafts (16); a pair of removal 

preventive portions (30) formed in one of the lever support shafts 
and the bearing hole portions and projecting in the diameter 

direction of one of the lever support shafts (16) and the bearing 
hole portions (24); and a pair of engaging surfaces (34) respectively 

provided in the other of the lever support shafts (16) and the 
bearing hole portions (24), engageable with the removal preventive 

portions (30) during the reciprocating rotational movement of the 
lever, and notched (32) partially to allow the removal preventive 

portions (30) to be inserted thereinto or removed therefrom at the 
disconnected position of the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lever support structure
for a lever-operated connector, the connector housings
thereof can be connected by use of the leverage of a lever.A lever-operated connector is advantageous in that the
connection and removal of the connector housings thereof
can be executed with a small force and, especially, it is
often applied to a multipole connector which has 20 poles
or more. The basic principle of the lever-operated connector
utilizes the leverage action of a lever and, as a
structure for the lever-operated connector, for example,
there is known such a structure as shown in Fig. 4.Such a known lever-operated connector is common knowledge
for an expert in the art of lever-operated connectors.On the left in Fig. 4, there is shown a female connector
housing 1 which stores therein a large number of female
terminals (not shown), while on the right there is shown a
male connector housing 2 which stores therein a large number
of male terminals and includes a hood portion 2a for
receiving the female connector housing 1. While cam receive
pins 3 are respectively provided on the right and left side
wall portions of the female connector housing 1, on the
right and left side walls of a hood portion 2a of the male
connector housing 2, there are formed slits 4 respectively
for receiving the cam receive pins 3.Also, a U-shaped lever 5 is rotatably mounted to the
male connector housing 2. A structure for mounting the
lever 5 to the male connector housing 2 is arranged such
that a pair of lever support shafts 2b are projected from
the right and left wall portions of the male connector
housing 2, two circular bearing holes 5a are respectively
formed in the right and left side portions of the lever 5 
and, as shown in Fig. 4, the lever support shafts 2b are
inserted through the two bearing holes 5a of the lever 5,
respectively.On the back surface of the lever 5, there are formed
two cam grooves 6 which are respectively engageable with
the cam receive pins 3. The cam grooves 6 are connected in
communication with slits 4 when the lever 5 is held at such
position as shown in Fig. 4. If the female connector housing
1 is inserted into the hood portion 2a of the male connector
housing 2 and the lever 5 is rotated in a direction
of an arrow shown in Fig. 4, then the cam grooves 6 of the
lever 5 allow the cam receive pins 3 and thus the female
connector housing 1 to advance deeply into the hood portion
2a of the male connector housing 2, which completes the
connection between the male and female

<CLAIMS>
A lever-operated connector comprising:

first (12) and second (11) connector housings to be
connected with each other;
lever means (17) including two cam portions (22), said
lever means (17) being rotatably mounted on said first connector

housing (12) in such a manner that said lever means
(17) straddles said first connector housing (12), wherein:
two cam receive portions (13) respectively engageable
with said two cam portions of said lever means (17) are

provided on said second connector housing (11), and, by rotating
said lever means (17) reciprocatingly, said cam receive

portions (13) are shifted so as to connect or disconnect
said first and second connector housings to and

from each other;
a pair of lever support shafts (40) are respectively
provided on and project from said first connector housing

(12); and
a pair of bearing hole portions (42) are respectively
formed in said lever means (17) and are engageable with

said lever support shafts (40);

   characterized in that

removal preventive portions (52) are formed in said
bearing hole portions (42) projecting towards the inside of

said bearing hole portions (42); and
the central portion of each of said lever support
shafts (40) is shaved over the whole periphery thereof

to form a reduced diameter portion (46) constituting an engaging
surface (44) engageable with said removal preventive

portion (52) during the reciprocating rotational movement
of said lever means (17).
The lever-operated connector of claim 1, wherein
each of the outer portion of said lever support shafts (40)

includes a notch groove (50) which is formed in the diameter
direction thereof, wherein the depths of said notch

grooves (50) are so set that the bottom of said notch
groove (50) is level with the outside diameter of said reduced

diameter portion (46), and wherein the length of each
of said lever support shafts (40) is so set that the outer

portion thereof projects externally of said lever means
(17).
The lever-operated connector of claim 2, wherein
said notch grooves (50) are set so in the outer portion of

said lever support shafts (40) that insertion of said removal
preventive portions (52) thereinto or removal therefrom

is possible at the disconnected position of said lever
means (17).
