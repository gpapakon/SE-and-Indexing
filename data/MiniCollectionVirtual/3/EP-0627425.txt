<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine
derivatives which have protein stabilizing
effect and suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation,
and are useful for treatment of cataract etc.Cataract is an intractable eye disease where an
opacification of lens is caused and results in a loss of
visual acuity. Various studies on a causal factor and
mechanism of cataract, and a treatment method therefor have
been made. But at present, there is very few medical
substances which are effective for cataract.It is reported that an increase of peroxide in lens is
related to a cause of cataract and a chemical substance
having suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation is
effective on treatment of cataract (Current Eye Res., 5, 37
(1986)). It is also reported that protein denaturation is 
observed in lenses of cataract patients (Ophthalmology, 19,
1283 (1977)).From the reports, a chemical substance which has
suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation in
combination with protein stabilizing effect can be presumed
to be especially useful for treatment of cataract. A
compound having the above both effects, however, has not
been studied and a development of such compound has been
desired.As the result of our precise study to find a compound
having suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation in
combination with protein stabilizing effect, the inventors
found that 3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives, in which
the 2nd-position was substituted by a benzylidene group and
the 4th-position was substituted by a carboxyalkyl group,
and the phenyl ring of the said benzylidene group was
further substituted by hydroxy and lower alkyl groups, had
the both effects.3-Oxo-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives having benzylidene
substituent at the 2nd-position, the chemical structure is
common to the basic structure of the compound of this
invention, were reported to be applicable to a herbicide
(U.S. Patent No.3923709), a tranquilizer (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 10671/1974) or a synthetic intermediate of
benzothiazepine derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 72875/1985). The chemical structure of the
compound of this invention is of course different from the
compounds disclosed in the above prior arts. Further the
prior arts disclose neither protein stabilizing effect nor
suppressive effect on lipid peroxide formation.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 287077/1989
discloses 2-benzylidene-3-oxo-1,4-benzothiazine derivatives
which have active oxygen elimination effect or suppressive
effect
