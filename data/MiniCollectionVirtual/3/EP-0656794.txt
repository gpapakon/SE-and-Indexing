<ABSTRACT>
A balloon dilatation catheter comprising an elongated tubular shaft and an inner tube defining inflation and guide wire lumens. A dilatation balloon is mounted on the distal end of the tubular shaft and communicates with the inflation lumen. The guide wire lumen extends through the balloon. A stiffening wire is positioned within the tubular shaft and has a proximal end secured in the proximal portion of the catheter. The distal end of the stiffening wire is anchored within the inner tube in an area adjacent the guide wire entrance port. The stiffening wire maximizes strength to the proximal portion of the catheter while maintaining flexibility in the distal end of the catheter as well as the balloon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dilatation catheter comprising an 
elongated tubular shaft 16, said shaft including means forming 
a guidewire port 30 for entry of a guidewire 12, a balloon 26 
attached to said tubular shaft 16, a stiffening wire 50 positioned 
within said tubular shaft 16, the distal end 34 of the stiffening 
wire being retained in a wire retention section, the wire 
retention section being proximal to the guidewire port 30. Dilatation catheters with stiffening wires particulary monorail 
dilatation catheters are commonly used in angioplasty procedures 
because the unique construction of such catheters enables the 
rapid exchange of the catheter once it is inserted into the 
patient. For example, EP-A-0 441 384 discloses a monorail catheter 
having an elongated tubular shaft defining a guidewire 
port 30 for entry of a guidewire 12, a balloon 26 attached to 
said tubular shaft 16, a stiffening wire 50 positioned within 
said tubular shaft 16, the distal end 34 of the stiffening wire 
being retained in a wire retention section, the wire retention 
section being proximal to the guidewire port 30. Although the monorail catheter provides rapid catheter exchange, 
it tends to lack stiffness and, therefore, is difficult to push 
through a patient's blood vessels. In the prior art construction, 
a stiffening wire extends through the catheter imparting 
stiffness to the catheter. However, the stiffening wire may 
impart stiffness in areas of the catheter where flexibility is 
desired, for example in the balloon. Due to the construction of the catheter, heretofore it has not 
been feasible to terminate a stiffening wire in a dilatation 
catheter proximal of the section of the catheter in which flexibility 
is desired. To provide enhanced flexibility in situations  
 
where a stiffening wire is used, tapered stiffening wires have 
been proposed. Schneider (Europe) AG sells a dilatation balloon 
catheter in which a tapered stiffening wire "floats" within the 
catheter, i.e., the stiffening wire is not anchored at its distal 
and proximal ends. While this construction, in the ideal 
situation, may provide the requisite stiffness and maintain 
distal flexibility, the floating stiffening wire is prone to 
movement which can lead to problems in manipulating the catheter. The Object of the invention is to provide a dilatation catheter 
in which a stiffening wire terminates proximal of the distal end 
of the catheter and is securely anchored in place at both its 
distal and proximal ends. A more specific

elongated shaft (16) comprises a distal shaft (34) and a 

proximal shaft (32), the proximal end of the distal shaft 
overlapping the distal end of the proximal shaft in such a 

way that the guidewire port is formed between the overlapping 
ends and wherein the balloon (26) is attached to the 

distal shaft (34).
