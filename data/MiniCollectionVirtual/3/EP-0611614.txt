<ABSTRACT>
A device for forming a mechanical connection between two 
concentric tubes (22,23). A cylindrical tool body (12) is sized to fit 

closely within the innermost tube of the concentric tubes. 
A central axial bore through the tool body slidably receives 

a mandrel (14) that is movable between a first extended position 
and a second inserted position in the tool body. Spherical 

dies (16) received in sockets (28) spaced circumferentially around the 
tool body are movable between a first retracted position and 

a second extended position in response to corresponding 
movement of the mandrel between its first and second 

positions. The spherical dies create indentations (72) between 
the two tubes when moved to their second extended position 

and form the mechanical connection. A pull rod attached at 
a first end to the mandrel and a second end to an air 

cylinder is used to cause movement of the mandrel between 
its first and second positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to a 
mechanical attachment between two tubes and particularly to 
a mechanical attachment that defines the load deflection 
characteristics of the joint. It is particularly suitable 
for connecting two concentric tubes of zirconium based 
alloys as used for instance in nuclear fuel assemblies. A commercial nuclear fuel assembly is formed from 
nuclear fuel rods, spacer grids, and guide tubes. The fuel 
rods are maintained in a spaced apart relationship and 
parallel to each other by the spacer grids. The spacer grids 
are formed from a plurality of interleaved metal strips on 
edge that define a number of cells. Each cell is sized to 
receive one fuel rod. A number of spacer grids are spaced 
apart along the length of the fuel rods to provide lateral 
support to the fuel rods. Several guide tubes are also 
received through the spacer grids in selected cells. The 
guide tubes provide a path and positive guidance for control 
rods as they are moved into or out of the fuel assembly. The 
guide tubes are also useful in maintaining the axial spacing 
of the spacer grids. One means that has been used to 
accomplish this is attaching tubular spacers, also known as 
ferrules or sleeves, to the guide tubes. The tubular spacers 
are either attached also to the grid or spaced in close 
proximity to the grid but not attached to it. The use of 
sleeves or tabs that are integral to the spacer grid 
constitutes a fixed skeletal restraint system. The use of 
sleeves attached to the guide tubes but spaced from and not 
attached to the spacer grid constitutes a floating restraint 
skeletal system. In the floating restraint system the load 
caused by the contact of one sleeve with the spacer grid 
prior to other sleeves contacting the grid may result in  
 
loads high enough to buckle the individual guide tube 
attached to the contacting sleeve since the load is not 
being shared by all the sleeves and guide tubes. Known 
methods for attachment of sleeves to the guide tubes include 
circumferential swaging, resistance welding, and laser 
welding. Circumferential swaging is an attachment method 
wherein the full diameter of each tubular member is expanded 
beyond its normal diameter. The resulting bulge or swage 
forms a mechanical connection between the two members. 
However, the swage causes a reduction in the length of the 
guide tube. This requires that the displacement caused by 
the swage be tightly controlled in order to control the 
resultant length change in the tube.

<CLAIMS>
A device for forming a mechanical connection between 
two concentric tubes, comprising: 


a. a cylindrical tool body (12) sized to fit closely 
within the innermost tube (22) of the concentric tubes 

and a central axial bore (26) therethrough; 
b. a mandrel (14) slidably received in said tool body so 
as to be movable between a first extended position and 

a second inserted position; 
c. a plurality of spherical punches (16) movably 
received in sockets spaced circumferentially around said 

tool body so as to be movable between a first retracted 
position and a second extended position in response to 

corresponding movement of said mandrel between its first 
and second positions; and 
d. means for moving said mandrel between said first and 
second positions. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said means for moving 
said mandrel comprises: 

   a pull rod (38) having a first end attached to said 
mandrel and a second end attached to an air cylinder which 

selectively controls the movement of said puli rod and said 
mandrel. 
The device of claim 1 or 2, further comprising a 
support tube (18) that slidably receives said pull rod and 

is attached at either end to said tool body and said air 
cylinder. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein said means for 
moving said mandrel comprises a pull rod with first and 

second ends having the first end attached to said mandrel, 
an air cylinder attached to the second end of said pull rod 

for selectively controlling the movement of said pull rod 
and said mandrel; and a support tube that slidably receives 

said pull rod and is attached at either end to said tool 
body and said air cylinder. 
The device of any one of claims 1-4, wherein the 
diameter of the exterior surface of one end of said mandrel 

is smaller than the interior diameter of the bore (26) in 
said tool body and tapers outwardly toward the opposite end 

of said mandrel to provide a close diametrical fit within 
the bore in said tool body.
