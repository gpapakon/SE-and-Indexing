<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous formulations of hirudin and particularly to depot
formulations.Hirudin, an anticoagulant naturally occurring in leeches (Hirudo medicinalis), is not a
single polypeptide species but a class of equally acting polypeptides consisting of at least
four representatives designated hirudin variant 1 (HV1), hirudin variant 2 (HV2) (cf.
European Patent Application No. 158 564) hirudin variant 3 (PA) [cf. PCT-Application
No. 86/03493] and "des-(Val)2-hirudin" (cf. European Patent Application No. 158 986).
The variants differ in structure from each other by a number of amino acids (especially,
the N-terminal sequence of HV1 is Val-Val-Tyr, that of HV2 and of HV3 is Ile-Thr-Tyr
and that of "des-(Val)2-hirudin" is Thr-Tyr) but have an accumulation of hydrophobic
amino acids at the N-terminus and of polar amino acids at the C-terminus, a tyrosine
residue (Tyr63) present as sulphate monoester, three disulphide bridges and the
anticoagulant activity in common.In the past few years cDNAs and synthetic genes coding for hirudin variants have been
cloned and expressed in microbial hosts. Although the expression products lack the
sulphate monoester group at Tyr63- and were therefore designated "desulphatohirudins" -
they turned out to exhibit approximately the same biological activity as the natural,
sulphated hirudins. Desulphatohirudin variant HV1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli
(European Patent Applications No. 158 564 and 168 342) and in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (European Patent Applications No. 168 342, 200 655, 225 633, 252 854 and 341
215). Similarly, desulphatohirudin HV2 has been expressed in Escherichia coli (European
Patent Applications No. 158 564) and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (European Patent
Application No. 200 655, PCT-Application No. 86/01224] and
des-(Val)2-desulphatohirudin has been expressed in Escherichia coli (European Patent
Application No. 158 986).According to the present invention, the term "hirudin" is intended to embrace hirudin,
desulphathohirudin, a hirudin variant or a desulphatohirudin variant or a mutant thereof, 
respectively, described in the literature and in particular a desulphatohirudin compound or
a mutant thereof obtainable from a transformed microorganism strain containing DNA
which codes for a desulphatohirudin or a mutant thereof. Such desulphatohirudins are, for
example, desulphatohirudin variant HV1, HV1 modified (a, b), HV2, HV2 modified (a, b,
c), HV3, variants of HV3 and des (Val2)-desulphatohirudin.Preferred
