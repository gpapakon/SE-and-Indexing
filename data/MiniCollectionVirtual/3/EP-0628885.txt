<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic process in which image 
information exposure step and a developing step are 

substantially simultaneously carried out to opposite 
sides of a photosensitive member (1) includes preparing an 

electrophotographic photosensitive member having a 
conductive base layer (11,12) transmitting light and a 

photosensitive layer (13) thereon; exposing (4) the conductive 
base side of the photosensitive member to light 

information; rubbing an opposite side of the 
photosensitive member with a developer supplied with a 

developing bias voltage of the same polarity as the 
polarity of the developer in a region (6) including an 

upstream side and a downstream side of an image 
exposure region of the photosensitive member; wherein 

an absolute value of a sum of a triboelectric charge 
potential provided on a surface of the photosensitive 

member by rubbing between the developer and the 
photosensitive member, and a surface potential of the 

photosensitive member provided by application of the 
developing bias upstream of the image exposure region, 

is larger than an absolute value of the developing 
bias.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic process of
simultaneously effecting image exposure and developing
steps to opposite sides of a photosensitive member.As for a copying apparatus or a recording
apparatus for providing hard copies from a computer,
an electrophotographic process is widely used. In an
electrophotographic process, charging, exposure and
developing steps are effected on a photosensitive
member sequentially, and an image visualized by toner
is transferred onto a transfer sheet, and the toner
image is fixed thereon into a final output record.
The printed image thus provided is advantageous in
high resolution and high contrast and therefore high
image quality, over thermal transfer type, ink jet
type and an impact printing type as other hard copy
producing means.However, a large number of steps are required
to form an image, and therefore, the circumferential
length of the photosensitive member which is movable
along an endless path is not easily reduced without 
resulting in high cost and a complicated structure.In view of the above, some methods have been proposed in which
the charging, exposing, and developing operations and
so on are simultaneously carried out substantially at
the same position using electrophotographic process.
Typical examples thereof are Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application Nos. 98746/1983 and 22145/1985.Generally, in the prior art of this type,
electroconductive toner or a mixture of
electroconductive carrier and insulative toner, is
used, and a series of process operations including (1)
removal of residual toner remaining after previous
image formation, (2) contact charging, (3) image
exposure from a back side of the photosensitive member
and (4) contact development, are substantially
simultaneously carried out. More particularly, these
process operations are all carried out in a contact
nip provided by a magnetic brush roller contacted to a
front surface of the photosensitive member at a
position corresponding to a back side image exposure
position.More particularly, as shown in Figure 3, the
cleaning operation is effected by removing residual
toner at a position upstream of the contact nip 6,
where a magnetic brush forms chains on a rotating
developing sleeve 2. At this time, the toner used is
magnetic toner. Since a magnet roll is disposed in 
the sleeve, the cleaning effect can be enhanced by the
magnetic force provided thereby.Subsequently, the surface of the
photosensitive member is rubbed by electroconductive
magnetic brush (conductive
