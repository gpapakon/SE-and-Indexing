<ABSTRACT>
A battery operated apparatus comprising a display and a battery state monitor for 
producing a signal indicative of the battery charge state. The display is 

illuminated by light having one of two or more predetermined characteristics 
associated therewith. The characteristics of the light with which the display is 

illuminated depend on the battery charge state signal. Thus information on the 
battery charge state can clearly and easily be obtained merely by observing the 

background illumination of the display.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a battery operated apparatus having a battery state 
monitor. A battery state monitor can be applicable to any battery operated apparatus. 
However, it is particularly useful in an apparatus such as a radio telephone in 
which it is advantageous to have an early warning of a reduction in battery charge 
to a level where the battery will shortly need to be replaced or recharged. Present radio telephones have displays which provide information to the user 
including, in the case of radio telephones which have a battery state monitor, a 
visual display of the battery state. This visual display may comprise a bar-like 
indicator, the height of which gradually decreases with decreasing battery voltage. When a state of the art radio telephone is being used the battery state information 
is presented during the call initiating stage prior to a call being connected. For 
outgoing calls the telephone display generally shows the number being called and 
possibly other information such as the volume. There is generally no continuous 
display of battery charge state during a telephone call. Consequently, should a 
user have failed to notice the battery state indication before making a telephone 
call the performance may deteriorate to the point where the telephone may cease 
to function during the call. The charge state of a battery can be measured by measuring the voltage provided 
by the battery. As the battery is discharged the battery voltage is initially 
substantially constant. However, as the battery charge begins to be depleted the 
battery voltage provided by the battery will also begin to reduce, until the battery 
charge is so low that a diminishingly small battery voltage is provided by the 
battery.  Also in radio telephones space on the display is limited particularly as the trend 
in radio telephones is towards smaller handsets. Thus a means which enables 
information regarding battery state to be displayed without requiring a portion of 
the display to be dedicated to this function would be advantageous. According to the present invention there is provided a battery operated apparatus 
comprising a display region illuminated by means for lighting operable in any one 
of a plurality of modes, the mode of illumination of the region being responsive 
to a signal indicative of the charge state of the battery. Thus in the case where the battery operated apparatus is a radio telephone 
information regarding battery state may be conveyed conveniently to the user 
during a call as
