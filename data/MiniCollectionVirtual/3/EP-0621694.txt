<ABSTRACT>
The interface circuit of the present invention adjusts the 
signal voltage across a leaking transistor (220) such that the leakage 

is reduced while also shunting out the adjustment means (225) when the 
adjustment means (225) impedes the operation of the interface circuit. 

One embodiment of the present invention is a level translator 
comprised of a level shifting stage coupled to a buffer stage. 

The level shifting stage has its power source coupled to a 
current shunting device (250). The current shunting device (250) is 

connected in parallel across the first P-channel device (225) of the 
level shifting stage. The first P-channel device (225) of the level 

shifting stage is connected in series with a second P-channel 
device (220) having its drain connected to a drain of a first N-channel 

device (215) wherein the first N-channel device (215) has its source 
connected to a drain of a second N-channel device (210). The current 

shunting device is formed from a single P-channel device (250). The 
connection (217) between the drains of the second P-channel (220) and the 

first N-channel device (215) of the level shifting stage is an input 
to an inverter (255) , which in turn, has its output (263) 

connected to the 
input of the current shunting device (250). When the input to the 

level shift stage is at the high voltage logic signal level, the 
input to the inverter is low and the output of the inverter (255) is 

at a high voltage logic signal level. The high voltage logic 
signal level then turns off the P-channel device (250) of the current 

shunting device. The first P-channel device (225) of the level 
shifting stage has its gate connected to its drain which reduces 

leakage current in the level shifting stage and reduces the 
power consumed by the interface circuit when the current 

shunting device (250) is turned off. When the input to the level shift 
stage is at the low voltage logic signal level, the input to the 

inverter (255) is high and the output of the inverter (255) is at a low 
voltage logic signal level. The low voltage logic signal level 

allows the current shunting device (250) to directly supply current to 
the second P-channel device (220) of the level shifting stage and 

shunts out the first P-channel device (225). Therefore, the shunted 
out device does not interfere with the performance of the level 

shift stage of the interface circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of integrated 
circuits. In particular, this invention relates to low power 
CMOS integrated circuits. More specifically, this invention 
relates to a CMOS integrated circuit interface between low power 
and high power integrated circuits. The field of integrated circuitry is a rapidly developing field 
of technology. The number of integrated circuits per unit of 
surface area of a substrate on which the integrated circuits are 
built, referred to as integrated circuit density, is continually 
increasing. The highest integrated circuit density is achieved 
using Field Effect Transistors (FETs). An FET is a device having 
a source, gate, and drain arranged such that when a high logic 
signal voltage is applied to the gate, current may pass from the 
source to the drain. Similarly, the FET does not allow current 
to pass between the source and the drain when a low logic signal 
is applied to the gate. When the integrated circuit density 
increases, the amount of power dissipated by the large number of 
integrated circuits on the substrate is increased. The amount of 
power dissipation is important because complicated heat sinks 
and circuit packaging may be required to prevent the chip 
temperature from rising above a value at which the chip was 
designed to operate. In addition, many electronic devices 
containing integrated circuits operate on stored power. For 
example, portable computers often operate on battery power. When 
power dissipation increases, the faster the battery wears down 
and the shorter the usefulness of the electronic device. 
Therefore, reducing power consumption is important for the 
design of integrated circuits.  
 One way to decrease the power consumption per unit area of 
substrate of the integrated circuit is to reduce the voltage at 
which the circuits operate. However, decreasing the voltage 
level at which circuits operate creates a compatibility problem 
because some integrated circuits are designed to operate at set 
voltage levels. For example, some circuits with which the low 
voltage circuits must interact, must operate at high voltage 
levels in order to operate electromechanical devices. Also, 
there are many integrated circuits in existence which cannot 
change or lower their operating voltage and the new lower 
voltage circuits must interact with them as well. Therefore, in 
order to lower the voltage of new integrated circuits to 
dissipate less power, some form of interface circuit must be 
developed so that the low
