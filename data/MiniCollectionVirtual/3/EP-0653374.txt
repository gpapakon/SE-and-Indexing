<ABSTRACT>
[OBJECT] The present invention provides a towing apparatus 

having a compact construction and having a high degree of 
freedom of arrangement of a guide pulley for guiding a tow 

cable, and control levers. 
[CONSTRUCTION] A guide pulley (17) is disposed above a 

straight line (L) passing a winding operation control handle 
(21) and the free end of a foldaway stay (6) in an unfolded 

state, and the shaft (13) of a winding drum (16) is disposed 
below the straight line (L).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a towing apparatus 
for towing a paraglider or drawing a beach seine. An apparatus having 
the features as set forth in the preamble portion of claim 1 
is known for example from US-A-3,322,398. A known towing apparatus of this kind disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 3-95098 comprises a 
power unit, a brake unit mounted on the output shaft of the 
power unit, a winding drum mounted on the output shaft of 
the power unit and combined with the brake unit to wind a 
tow cable thereon, and a guide pulley disposed above the 
winding drum so as to be swingable in horizontal directions 
to guide the tow cable when winding the tow cable on and 
unwinding the tow cable from the winding drum. In this known towing apparatus, control levers including 
a brake lever and a throttle lever for controlling 
the winding operation of the winding drum are arranged in 
the vicinity of the tow cable and on both sides of the guide  
 
pulley. Therefore, the towing apparatus needs protective 
members for obviating the interference between the tow cable 
and the control levers, which inevitably makes the construction 
of the towing apparatus complex. The present invention has been made in view of those 
problems in the prior art and it is therefore an object of 
the present invention to provide a towing apparatus provided 
with control levers, a guide pulley and a tow cable arranged 
so that the control levers will not interfere with the guide 
pulley and the tow cable, and having a construction having 
high degree of freedom. To solve the foregoing problems, the present invention 
provides a towing apparatus comprising a power unit provided 
with a brake unit and a winding drum said power unit further including 
a brake operating lever and a winding operation control lever; a towing cable wound on 
the winding drum, and a guide pulley for guiding the towing 
cable when winding the towing cable on and unwinding the same 
from the winding drum, characterized in that the guide 
pulley can be swung within 
a fixed angular range of swing motion within a horizontal plane and that said 
brake operating lever and said winding operation control lever 
are disposed outside of said fixed angular range 
of said guide pulley.  
 Preferably, the winding operation control lever is 
disposed on the same level as the guide pulley on the side 
opposite the towing side with respect to a guide pulley 
support unit supporting the guide pulley. The guide pulley is disposed above a straight line 
pass
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A towing apparatus comprising: a power unit (12) 
provided with a brake unit (14) and a winding drum (16) 

said power unit further including a brake operating lever (22) 
and a winding operation control lever (21); a towing 

cable (15) wound on the winding drum; and a guide pulley (17) for 
guiding the towing cable when winding the towing cable on 

and unwinding the same from the winding drum;
 
   characterized in that the 

guide pulley (17) can be swung 
within a fixed angular range, of swing motion within a horizontal plane 

and that said brake operating 
lever and said winding operation control lever 

are disposed outside of said fixed angular range 
of said guide pulley. 
A towing apparatus according to claim 1, 
wherein the winding operation control lever (21) is disposed on 

the same level as the guide pulley (17) on the side opposite the 
towing side with respect to a guide pulley support unit 

supporting the guide pulley. 
A towing apparatus according to any preceding claim 
characterized in that a 

guide pulley (17) is disposed above a straight line (L) passing a 
winding operation control lever (21) and the free end of a 

foldaway stay (6) in a fully unfolded state, and a winding drum (16)  
 

is disposed with its axis positioned below the straight 
line.
