<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for vacuum mixing at least one powdery component and at least one liquid component, in particular bone cement. The device has an evacuable mixing container (1) and a body (4) movably arranged within the mixing container. The outer circumference of the body (4) forms a tight closure on the inner wall of the mixing container (1). The body (4) has an inner opening covered by a filter (9). The filter (9) is designed in such a way that air can flow therethrough, but not the powdery component of the mixture of substances. This device allows bubble-free mixtures of substances to be prepared.
