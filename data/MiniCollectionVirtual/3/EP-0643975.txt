<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cell storage bag 
system and a method of storing cells, and in particular 
relates to a cell storage bag system for storing cells such 
as red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets 
that have been separated from an extracted portion of blood, 
and also relates to a cell storage system for use in the 
cultivation of cells in a liquid medium. In recent years, in order to prevent the spread of 
infectious diseases (for example, hepatitis, AIDS and the 
like) and the occurrence of immunological side effects as a 
result of blood transfusions between two different people 
having the same blood type, the practice of receiving a 
transfusion of one's own blood has gained attention. Among 
the methods for the transfusion of one's own blood, there is 
known a storage type transfusion. In the storage type 
transfusion, a blood reserve is established by removing 
blood from a patient (blood donor) prior to undergoing 
surgery and storing such removed blood in a blood bag which 
is itself then stored in a storage container for preserving 
the stored blood. Then, at the time the patient is to 
undergo surgery, the blood bag is removed from the storage 
container and the patient's blood stored therein is used to 
give the patient any needed blood transfusions during the  
 
course of the surgery. At the time when such blood transfusions are being 
carried out, it is necessary to ensure that there is an 
adequate volume of blood available for transfusion, and this 
is done by carrying out one of several methods. In one 
method, this is accomplished by freezing the liquid blood 
stored in the blood bag. In another method the blood is 
maintained in liquid form in the blood bag, for example, 
employing the leap-frog method or the switch-bag method. In 
the switch-bag method, before the day of the surgery the 
blood that was previously stored is returned to the patient 
and then twice volume of the blood is once again extracted 
from the patient and stored. By employing these type of 
methods, it is possible to ensure a relatively large amount 
of fresh blood in a short period of time. However, in order to employ the first method 
mentioned above, it is necessary to have the proper 
equipment for freezing the samples, and in addition to the 
maintenance that is required for such equipment, an 
inappropriate amount of time, labor and cost is required for 
freezing and thawing blood stored in the blood bags. As for 
the second method mentioned above using the switch-bag 
metho
