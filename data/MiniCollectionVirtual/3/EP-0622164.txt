<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for treating solid, liquid and/or gaseous matter, having an activator with at least three coaxially arranged blade rows (3, 4, 5) which can be driven in opposite directions and have set impact blades (6), the circumferential velocity of the outermost blade rows (3, 4, 5) being between 70 m/s and 160 m/s. In order to increase the extent of the attainable activation of the particles of matter and thus increase the capacity of the device as well as the quality of the products obtained, provision is made for the width (b1, b2, b3) of the blade rows (3, 4, 5) to decrease to the outside by at least 2%, preferably by at least 5% and by a maximum of 10%.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the treatment of solid, liquid and/or
gaseous substances with an activator with at least

three coaxially arranged, oppositely drivable rows of
shovels (3, 4, 5) with beater shovels (6) having an

angle of attack, with the circumferential speed of the
outermost rows of shovels (3, 4, 5) being between 70

m/s and 160 m/s, characterized in that the width (b1,
b2, B3) of the rows of shovels (3, 4, 5) decreases

outwardly by at least 2 %, preferably by at least 5 %
and maximally by 10 %.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the beater shovels (6) are arranged concavely and

preferably consist of at least two substantially plane
and mutually angular plates (6', 6'', 6''').
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the outer edges of the beater shovels (6)

facing the rotational axis are covered with protective
strips (10).
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that a fan shovel (8) is arranged

between two adjacent beater shovels (6) of the
outermost row of shovels (5).
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that a fan shovel (8) is adjacent,

preferably at a right angle, to the beater shovel (6)
on the outer edge of each beater shovel (6) of the

outermost row of shovels (5) on the side disposed in
the rotational direction (A) of the rotor (1).
A method for the treatment of solid, liquid or gaseous
substances having several components in an apparatus

as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the particles are excited with increasing

frequency during the passage of the rows of shovels
(3, 4, 5) which decrease outwardly in their width by

at least 2 %, preferably by at least 5 % and maximally
by 10 %.
A method as claimed in claim 6 for the production of
hardenable masses, in particular of building materials

such as concrete, mortar and the like, characterized
in that


binder, aggregate and liquid, preferably water, are
introduced simultaneously or as a mixture in the

activator with coaxially arranged, oppositely moving
rows of shovels (3, 4, 5),
the particles of the material move in the apparatus
from the inside to the outside and
are excited with rising amplitude by passing the outer
rows of shovels (3, 4, 5) rotating with a

circumferential speed of between 70 m/s and 160 m/s.
A method as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that
cement, lime or sodium water glass is used as binder.
A method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, characterized in
that sand, loess, rumble or filter ash is used as

aggregate.
A method as claimed in one of the claims 6 to 9,
characterized in that the rotational speed of the rows

of shovels (3, 4, 5) is between 800 and 3000 1/min.
A method as claimed in claim 6 for the production of
multi-phase stable media such as emulsions or

suspensions, characterized in that

the individual components are introduced according to
the desired mass ratio either simultaneously or as a

mixture into the activator with coaxially arranged,
oppositely moving rows of shovels (3, 4, 5),

from the inside to the outside and 
are excited with rising amplitude and with rising
frequency by passing the outer rows of shovels (3, 4,

5) rotating with a circumferential speed of between 70
m/s and 160 m/s.
A method as claimed in claim 11, characterized in that
water and/or oil as well as coal dust are used as

starting materials.
A method as claimed in claim 11 or 12, characterized
in that the rotational speed of the rows of shovels

(3, 4, 5) is between 950 and 2800 1/min.
A method as claimed in claim 6 for the treatment of
gases, in particular for the absorption of pollutants,

characterized in that

- a liquid or dust-like medium is injected into the gas
to be treated,
- the gas plus medium is introduced into the activator
with coaxially arranged, oppositely moving rows of

shovels (3, 4, 5),
- the medium is moved in the activator from the inside
to the outside and
- is excited with rising amplitude and with rising
frequency by passing the outer rows of shovels (3, 4,

5) rotating with a circumferential speed of between 70
m/s and 160 m/s, and
- the medium is separated from the gas.
A method as claimed in claim 14, characterized in that
a solid or a mixture of solids is added to a liquid

medium prior to the injection.
A method as claimed in claim 14, characterized in that
a solid or a mixture of solids is fed to the activator
