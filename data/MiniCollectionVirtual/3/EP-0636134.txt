<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, useful as a drug for the 
treatment of AIDS und AIDS related complex. More specifically, the 
present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a 
compound of the formula: 
 
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein 
one of R1 and R2 is a compound selected from the group consisting of 
a) a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid acyl group containing 13 to 14 carbon 
atoms wherein at least one methylene group 
normally present at position 4 to 13 is replaced by at least one 
oxygen or sulfur atom, b) a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid acyl group, containing 13 to 14 carbon 
atoms in the principal chain and up to a total of 18 carbon atoms, which is 
substituted by halo, hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto or alkylthio, c) a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid acyl group, containing 13 to 14 carbon 
atoms in the principal chain and up to a total of 18 carbon atoms, wherein at 
least one methylene group normally present at position 5 to 12 is 
replaced by at least one oxygen or sulfur atom 
and which is substituted by halo, hydroxy, alkoxy or alkylthio,  
while the other is hydrogen, a compound selected from a) to c) or a fatty acid acyl 
group containing 4 to 26 carbon atoms in the principal chain and up to a total 30 
carbon atoms, and 
R is a naturally occurring polar group characteristic of a glycerophospholipid 
isolated from endogenous sources. The present compositions are useful in the treatment of AIDS. More specifically, the 
compositions of the present invention possess anti-viral activity especially anti-retroviral 
activity. Thus, these compositions of the present invention are useful in combatting 
and/or retarding the growth of retroviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). As such, the compositions of the present invention are useful  
 
in treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). The effectiveness of the compounds contained in the compositions of the 
present invention are illustrated in the following 
figures, which are discussed in more detail hereinbelow. Figure 1 depicts the anti-HIV activity in T-cells 
of AC1, AC2, 1-(12-methoxydodecanoyl)-sn-3-glycerophosphatidylcholine 
and 12-methoxydodecanoic 
acid. Results are plotted on mM scale for direct 
comparison. Toxicity of the compounds in the CEM cells
