<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary-type filling machine with an upper machine part (5) which bears the filling element (10) and can be adjusted in height relative to a lower machine part (4). A container support (11) with lifting element (12) is assigned to each filling element (10). Said lifting element acts between the vertically adjustable machine part (5) and container support (11) in order to raise and lower the latter for a press-on displacement. The press-on displacement is limited to a value which is smaller than the maximum nominal displacement exhibited by the respective lifting element due to its type of construction.
