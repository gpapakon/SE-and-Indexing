<ABSTRACT>
In a printing unit for a rotary printing machine, in particular in a printing unit for carrying out a flying printing-plate change, a smooth-running, clearance-free engagement of further cylinders on a forme cylinder is to be made possible. This is effected by the fact that the axle journals of all the cylinders are provided with rotatable support discs, eccentrically designed support discs being engageable against concentrically designed support discs in pairs. The outer contact faces of the support discs are stationary during operation while the axle journals are arranged rotatably in the inner ring of the support disc.

Printing unit for a rotary printing machine for carrying out
a flying printing-plate change, having a first and a second forme

cylinder (1; 2), in each case a forme inking roller (14; 16)
acting on the forme cylinders (1; 2), and an impression cylinder

(24) capable of being selectively set against one of the two
forme cylinders (1; 2), characterized in that on all the journals

(4, 6; 17, 18; 22) of all the cylinders (1, 2; 14, 16; 24) there
is arranged at least one supporting disc (33, 34, 49, 52; 48, 51;

37, 38) each, in which the respective journal (4; 6; 17; 18; 22)
is rotatably mounted, in that on each journal (4; 6) of the forme

cylinders (1; 2) there are mounted two supporting discs (33, 49;
52, 34) which are circular, or have at least two spaced-apart

circular segments at the periphery, and are arranged one behind
the other when seen in the direction of the longitudinal axis of

the forme cylinders (1; 2), in that on each journal (17; 18) of
the forme inking rollers (14; 16) there is arranged a supporting

disc (48; 51), in that on each journal (22) of the impression
cylinder (24) there are arranged two supporting discs (38; 37)

which are arranged one behind the other when seen in the
direction of the longitudinal axis of the impression cylinder

(24), in that an envelope curve of the supporting discs (48; 51;
38; 37) arranged on the journals (17; 18; 22) of the forme inking

rollers (14; 16) and of the impression cylinder (24) has an
eccentricity (27, 28; 50, 55), in that supporting discs (33, 49;

52, 34; 48, 51; 38, 37) arranged on directly adjacent different

journals (4; 6; 17; 18; 22) cooperate in each case in pairs (38,
34; 52, 51 or 37, 33; 49, 48) at the periphery via their contact

surfaces, in that the supporting discs (48; 51; 38; 37) having
the eccentricity (27, 28; 50, 55) are constructed such that they

can rotate in a defined manner.
Printing unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the forme inking rollers (14; 16) capable of being set onto the 

forme cylinders (1; 2) are constructed as height-adjustable (B)
engraved rollers (14; 16), onto which a chamber doctor (29; 31)

can be set in each case.
Printing unit according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the impression cylinder (24) capable of being set onto the

forme cylinders (1; 2) is pivotably mounted.
Printing unit according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the forme cylinders (1; 2) are provided with flexible

printing plates (3).
Printing unit according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that each supporting disc (33, 34, 49, 52) of the forme cylinders

(1; 2) is a ball bearing whose inner ring (35) is connected to
the journal (4; 6) of the cylinder (1; 2) mounted fixed to the

frame, whose circular outer ring (40) is constructed as a
stationary race.
Printing unit according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that each supporting disc (48, 51; 37, 38) of the forme inking

rollers and of the impression cylinder (14; 16; 24) is a ball
bearing (48, 51; 37, 38) whose inner ring (35) is connected to

the journal (17, 18; 22) of the cylinder (14, 16; 24) capable of
being set on, whose supporting disc having an eccentricity (27,

28; 50, 55) is constructed as a stationary race.
Printing unit according to Claims 1 and 6, characterized in
that the supporting discs (48, 51; 37, 38) having an eccentricity

(27, 28; 50, 55) have at their outer contact face (40) toothing
(41, 42; 56, 57) which is positively connected to a drive (43,

46; 44, 47; 58, 61; 59, 62).
Printing unit according to Claim 1, characterized in that
each one of the two supporting discs (38 or 37) of the impression

cylinder (24) is arranged such that it can be brought into
contact selectively with each of a second supporting disc (34 or 

33) situated on a journal (4 or 6) of a forme cylinder (1 or 2).
