<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anti-collision device. A moving object (1) proceeding in a given direction along a displacement vector (D) and having a relative speed vector (VR) directed towards an obstacle (3), is equipped with at least two antennae emitting a UHF signal capable of being received by the obstacle (3). The device further includes means for receiving and analysing the echoes received from the obstacle (3), the analysis means determining the variation with respect to time of the angle ( theta ) between the displacement vector (D) and the relative speed vector (VR), a substantially zero variation of the angle ( theta ) indicating a risk of collision. Application: equipment of motor vehicles for avoiding collisions, particularly in poor visibility conditions.

<CLAIMS>
Device for preventing a collision between a moving
object (1) and an obstacle (3, R), the moving object

heading in a given direction along a displacement vector
(D) and having a relative speed vector (V
R
) directed
towards the obstacle (3), the device comprising at least

two antennas (A
1
, A
2
) fixedly joined to the moving object
(1) and transmitting a UHF signal liable to be received by

the obstacle (3), means (A
1
, A
2
, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66) for
receiving and means (63, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73) for analysing

the echos received from the obstacle (3), the analysis
means determining the variation with respect to time of

the angle () between the displacement vector (D) and the
relative speed vector (V
R
), a substantially zero variation
of the angle () indicating a risk of collision, the

antennas transmitting sequentially one after the other,
the device comprising means (62) for preserving the

instantaneous phase of the echo samples received during
each antenna transmission, so as to obtain a Doppler

signal (51, 52) constituted by said received samples, the
Doppler signal containing information about the value of

the angle (), the device having first switching means
(61) for the signals received by the antennas (
A
1
, A
2
), the
output of said switching means being connected to means

for obtaining the Doppler signal (62),

characterised in that the output of said means is
connected on the one hand to a first low-pass filter (63)

and on the other hand to second switching means (64)
synchronous with the first switching means (61) and

switching the Doppler signal to an inverter channel (66)
or to a non-inverter channel (65), the non-inverter

channel (65) being switched over when a first antenna (
A
1
)
is switched over and the inverter channel (66) being

switched over when the other antenna (
A
2
) is switched
over, the two channels (65, 66) being wired at their 

outputs to the input of a second low-pass filter (67), the
outputs of the filters (63, 67) being connected to means

(68) for dividing the output signal (So) of the first
filter (63) by the output signal (Sπ) of the second filter

(67), the ratio of the signals (So/Sπ) containing
information about the value of the angle ().
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the antennas (
A
1
, A
2
) are used for transmitting and
receiving.
Device according to either of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises means (71, 72, 73) for

computing the derivative with respect to time of the ratio
of the signals (So/Sπ), the absolute value of the

derivative


falling below a threshold (73)
indicating a risk of collision.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the output of the dividing means

(68) is connected to the input of the derivative means
(71) giving the absolute value of the derivative with

respect to time of the ratio of the signals (So/Sπ), the
output of the derivative means being compared with a

threshold (73) via comparison means (72) whose output
supplies a signal giving the risk of collision.
Device according to either of claims 3 and 4,
characterised in that the threshold (73) is a function of

the distance between the moving object (1) and the
obstacle (3) to define a lateral divergence within which

the presence of the obstacle indicates a risk of
collision.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the moving object being a motor 

vehicle, the antennas (
A
1
, A
2
) are each positioned level
with a front headlamp of the vehicle.
Device acording to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it measures the speed of the

obstacle (3) and the distance thereof to the moving object
(1), these measurements being combined with the

measurement of the angle () in order to indicate a risk
of collision.
