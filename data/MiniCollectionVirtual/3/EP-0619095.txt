<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring and/or identifying surface structures as well as near-surface structures of an object resting on a planar or arched surface. For this purpose, use is made of ultrasound waves which irradiate the object via fluid or a solid body, measurement being made of the waves backscattered by the object. The emitting transducer (1) for the ultrasound waves is in this case a focusing transducer whose focal point lies within a hole (2) so that a point radiation source (8) is obtained. The basic design of the invention can be seen in Figure 1.

Device for depiction of ultrasonics to record and/or identify structures on the
surface and nearby of an object laying on a support and being exposed to ultrasonic

waves of a transmitting transducer (1) passing through a liquid or a
solid and the ultrasonic waves scattered back from the object are recorded by

a receiving transducer (5)
characterized in that
a) the receiving transducer (5) is placed on the spherical concave surface
(3) of a support dircted to the support for the object with a hole (2)

being from one to ten times of the wavelength of the ultrasonic waves
in diameter.
b) the transmitting transducer (1) is focussing the ultrasonic waves
transmitted by himself in this way that their focal point is located

in the hole of the support (4) so that the hole (2) works as source of
radiation (8) for spherical ultrasonic waves to expose the whole object

simultaneously to ultrasonic waves and
c) the curvecenter of the spherical surface (3) is located in the center of
the focussing support (7) surface.
Device according patent claim 1,
characterized in that

the receiving transducer (5) consists of one or several transducer elements
(5) located arround the hole. 
Device according patent claim 1,
characterized in that

the support (7) is a convex concave or concave convex lens.
Device according patent claim 1,
characterized in that

the support (7) consists of a convex concave disc of equal thickness.
Device according patent claim 1 and 2,
characterized in that

the transducer elements (5) are strung together.
Device according patent claim 4,
characterized in that

the transducer elements (5) are placed in a ring (6).
Device according patent claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that

the transducer elements strung together (5) are in the order of magnitude of
the wavelength of the ultrasonics in diameter.
Device according patent claim 1,
characterized in that

the ultrasonic radiation is executed by means of a group of impulses.
Device according patent claim 1,
characterized in that

the ultrasonic radiation is executed with variable frequencies of ultarsonics. 
Device according one or several of the preceding patent claims,
characterized in that

the hole (2) is located in the center of the surface (3) of the support (4).
Device according patent claims 1 or 8,
characterized in that

the hole (2) consists in a funnel shaped opening (9) of the support (4).
