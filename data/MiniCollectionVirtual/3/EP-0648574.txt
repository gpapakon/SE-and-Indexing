<ABSTRACT>
A high speed production unit for performing machining 
operations, has a first horizontal slide (3), a second 

slide (6) slidable horizontally along a direction 
orthogonal to the sliding direction of the first slide 

(3) and a third vertically sliding slide (9) carrying a 
tool head (10). In addition to a static tool magazine 

(50), the unit has a dynamic tool magazine (11) which 
is displaceable between an operative position adjacent 

to the working area of the tool head (10) and an 
inoperative position spaced apart from said working 

area for replacement of broken or worn tools without 
any loss in cycle time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of 
a high speed production unit for performing machining 
operations which has been disclosed in Italian patent 
application TO91U000132 of the Applicant, as well as in 
the corresponding European patent application 
EP-0 517 168. The above identified references disclose a high 
speed production unit for performing machining 
operations which is being presently produced and 
marketed by the Applicant and comprises: 
a bed, a first slide, slidably mounted along a first 
horizontal axis on said bed, a second slide, slidably mounted on said first 
slide along a second horizontal axis orthogonal to said 
first horizontal axis, said second slide having a lower 
sliding plane which is inclined at an angle lower than 
90° with respect to the horizontal plane, and a third slide slidably mounted along a third 
vertical axis on said second slide and carrying a tool 
head, a tool magazine for the tool head having a 
support body provided with means for supporting a 
plurality of tools each provided with means for quick 
coupling to said tool head; said support body being 
static with respect to said bed; said head being 
adapted to pick up and store tools in said static 
magazine in order to perform the various operations of 
a machining cycle on a piece to be machined. Due to the above described inclined arrangement of 
the sliding plane of the second slide, a lower stress 
of the cooperating slide-ways is obtained along with  
 
the resulting possibility of a more rapid displacement 
of the movable masses, with advantage for the 
production speed. During machining of a piece, the tool head provides 
by itself to store and pick up tools in said static 
magazine, so that it can perform all the machining 
operations programmed on a given piece. However, when a 
tool in the static magazine reaches the end of its life 
because of wear or rupture, it must be replaced, which 
can be done by stopping the machine, with a resulting 
loss in time. The details relating to the structure of the known 
production unit which has been mentioned above and the 
advantages thereof are not disclosed herein, since they 
are described in the above identified Italian 
application and in the parallel European patent 
application of the same Applicant. The object of the present invention is that of 
further improving the production which has been 
previously proposed by the Applicant, allowing for 
replacement of broken or worn tools without any loss in 
cycle time. In order to achieve

<CLAIMS>
High speed production unit for performing 
machining operations, comprising
 
   a bed (2),
 
   a first slide (3) slidably mounted along a first 

horizontal axis (X) on said bed (2),
 
   a second slide (6) slidably mounted on said first 

slide (3) along a second horizontal axis (Y) orthogonal 
to said first horizontal axis (X), said second slide 

(6) having a lower sliding plane (7) inclined at an 
angle lower than 90° with respect to the horizontal 

plane,
 
   a third slide (9) slidably mounted along a third 

vertical axis (Z) on said second slide (6) and carrying 
a tool head (10),
 
   a tool magazine (50) for the tool head having a 

support body (51) provided with means for supporting a 
plurality of tools (13) each provided with means for 

quick coupling to said tool head (10), said support 
body being static with respect to said bed; said head 

being adapted to pick up and store tools in said static 
magazine in order to provide for the different 

operations of a machining cycle programmed on a given 
piece to be machined,
 
   
characterized in that
 said production unit is 
provided with an auxiliary dynamic tool magazine (11) 

for the tool head (10), said dynamic magazine (11) 
having a support body (12) provided with means for 

supporting a plurality of tools (13) each provided with 
means for quick coupling to said tool head (10), and in 

that said body (12) of said dynamic magazine (11) is 
displaceable between an operative position, in which it 

is adjacent to the working area of said tool head (10), 
so as to allow for a broken or worn tool (13) to be 

discharged by the tool head (10) into the dynamic  
 

magazine (11) and a new tool (13) provided at the 
dynamic magazine (11) to be picked up by the tool head 

(10), and an inoperative position, in which said body 
(12) of said dynamic magazine (11) is spaced apart from 

the working area of the tool head (10), so as to allow 
for replacement of broken or worn tools (13) without 

any interference with the machining cycle of the tool 
head (10). 
Production unit according to claim 1, 

characterized in that
 said support body (12) of the 
dynamic magazine (11) is placed at one end of a beam 

(14) which is pivotally mounted on bed (2) of the 
production unit between said two operative and 

inoperative positions. 
Production unit according to claim 2, 

characterized in that
 a fluid cylinder (16) is 
interposed between said beam (14) and the bed (2) to
