<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gaming system comprising a 
centralized controller and at least one gaming machine connected 
to the centralized controller by a line and gaming machines used 
with the gaming system. Generally, in gaming houses such as pinball halls, a player 
can play only one type of game, such as a pinball or slot machine, 
at each gaming machine. To prevent players from losing the enjoyment of playing 
games, the degree of difficulty in playing games at each gaming 
machine is preferably adjusted appropriately in response to how 
the players win games, etc., at the gaming machine. However, it 
requires a great deal of labor and is not practical to make such 
adjustment manually for each game for all gaming machines. Thus, enhancing the diversity, enjoyment, convenience, etc., 
of playing games is a limited way. The player can still play only one type of game at one 
gaming machine; he or she cannot select one among various games.  
 
To provide diversified games, the gaming house must contain a 
large number of gaming machines, which requires a large location 
and enormous costs. If the degree of difficulty in playing games is not adjusted, 
if it is too much difficult for players to win games, they may not 
enjoy playing games, while if it is too much easy for players to 
win games, they may lose interest in playing games. Thus, the 
players can preferably win games at a given degree of difficulty, 
but if every gaming machine is adjusted to a given degree of 
difficulty, the players may or may not be able to win games at a 
desirable degree of difficulty depending on their skill in playing 
games. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a 
gaming system which enables a player to play various games at a 
gaming machine by selecting one of the games, and gaming 
machines used with the gaming system. It is another object of 
the invention to provide a gaming system which adjusts the 
degree of difficulty in playing a game at each gaming machine in 
response to the game score condition and gaming machines used 
with the gaming system. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide a gaming system which controls termination of gaming 
machines in response to the score and the degree of difficulty and 
gaming machines used with the gaming system. It is another  
 
object of the invention to provide a gaming system which can 
execute batch management of gaming machine termination control 
and degree of difficulty setting by a centralized controller, and 
gaming machines

image display unit for outputting a game image, and an operation 

section for accepting various operation commands input by a 
player for playing a game, 

   said controller having a storage and a CPU, 
   said CPU comprising: 

   a game controller for controlling a game; 
   an image display controller for outputting information, as 

instructed from said game controller, to said game image display 
unit; and 

   a game interface for sending commands input to said 
operation section to said game controller, 

   said game controller comprising: 
   means for determining a degree of difficulty in playing a 

game; 
   means for executing a game at the degree of difficulty; and 

   means for informing said centralized controller of game 
conditions, and that 

   said centralized controller comprises: 
   a controller, 

   said controller comprising:
 

   means for accepting input of a game condition; 
   means responsive to the accepted game condition for 

determining a degree-of-difficulty change value used to 
determine the degree of difficulty; and 

   means for informing said game controller of the determined 
degree-of-difficulty change value. 
The gaming system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 

controller of said centralized controller further includes: 
   means responsive to the accepted game condition for 

determining whether or not the gaming machine is to be
