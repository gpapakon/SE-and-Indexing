<ABSTRACT>
Provided are methods of preparing an Nb₃Al 
superconducting wire and an Nb₃Al stranded wire having 

excellent superconductivity and uniform characteristics to 
be applicable to manufacturing of large-sized conductors 

or coils, and an apparatus for preparing the same. 
The method of preparing an NB₃Al superconducting wire 
comprises the steps of passing an Nb/Al composite wire 

(14) consisting of an Nb metal or an Nb alloy and an Al 
metal or an Al alloy through a furnace (12) for heating 

the same from the room temperature to a prescribed 
temperature, subsequently passing the same (14) through 

the furnace (12) for holding the same at the prescribed 
temperature, and subsequently passing the same (14) 

through a cooling part (13) for cooling the same from the 
prescribed temperature to the room temperature, and these 

steps are continuously carried out by continuously moving 
the wire (14). According to the present invention, it is 

possible to obtain an Nb₃Al superconducting wire having 
homogeneous characteristics along its overall width with a 

high critical current density. 
Further, it is possible to obtain an Nb₃Al 
superconducting stranded wire similarly having high 

characteristics, by stranding up wires which are heat 
treated in the aforementioned manner, or previously 

stranding up wires and thereafter heat treating the same 
in the aforementioned manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing
an Nb3Al superconducting wire and an Nb3Al superconducting
stranded wire, and more particularly, it relates to a
method of preparing an Nb3Al superconducting wire and an
Nb3Al superconducting stranded wire serving as high
magnetic field superconducting materials for
superconducting magnets which can be employed for nuclear
fusion or the like.An Nb3Al superconducting material is expected
particularly as a material for a nuclear fusion reactor
which is exposed to high magnetic force in a high magnetic
field, or a power storage superconducting material, due to
a high critical current and excellent distortion
resistance in a high magnetic field. However, it is
difficult to work Nb3Al, which is an intermetallic
compound, into a thin wire due to inferior workability,
dissimilarly to an alloy superconducting material such as
an Nb-Ti material. In order to obtain an Nb3Al
superconducting wire, therefore, an Nb metal and an Al 
metal are generally composited with each other and then
drawn into a thin wire, which in turn is finally heat
treated.Further, Nb3Al is stable only under a high temperature
at least 1600°C in a binary system of Nb-Al. In order to
form Nb3Al at a lower temperature, therefore, it is
necessary to reduce distance of Nb and Al diffusion pairs
below several 10 nm by a jelly roll method or the like.In an Nb/Al composite material which is prepared by
compositing Nb and Al metals, however, the filament is
ununiformly deformed when the material is worked into a
thin wire, due to inferior workability. Therefore, an
Nb3Al superconducting wire which is obtained by heat
treating the composite material cannot attain a
sufficiently high critical current density.Further, a compound superconducting material such as
Nb3Al is coiled before a heat treatment by the so-called
wind-and-react method, since its superconductivity is
extremely deteriorated by distortion such as bending.
When the coil as formed is increased in size, however, it
is difficult to carry out a uniform heat treatment as a
whole.In order to improve superconductivity, it is
preferable to form Nb3Al which is close to a stoichiometric
composition and provided with fine crystal grains by 
performing the heat treatment in a short time at the
highest possible temperature, while maintaining this Nb3Al
by rapidly cooling the same to the room temperature.
However, it is difficult to heat treat and cool a large-sized
coil in such a manner. Document US-A-4 088 512 discloses a continuous method
