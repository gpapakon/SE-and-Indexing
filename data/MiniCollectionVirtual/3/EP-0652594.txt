<ABSTRACT>
In an integrated circuit arrangement with at least one power component and low-voltage components, at least one power component is produced in a semiconductor substrate, at least one contact of the power component being arranged on a main surface of the substrate (1). The contact (11) is covered with an insulation layer (13), on the surface of which at least one thin-film component, in particular a thin-film transistor (14, 15, 16, 17, 18), is produced above the contact (11).

Integrated circuit arrangement having at least one
power component and low-voltage components,


in which a power component is realized in a manner
integrated in a semiconductor substrate (1),
in which the power component is MOS-controlled,
in which at least one contact of the power
component is arranged on a main area of the

substrate (1),
in which the power component has a source region
(6), which adjoins the main area, and a source

metallization plane (11), which is arranged on the
main area, the source metallization plane forming

the contact with the source region,
in which the source metallization plane (11) is

covered with an insulation layer (13),
in which at least one thin-film component (14, 15,
16, 17), used as a low-voltage component, is

realized above the contact (11), so that the
contact screens the thin-film component from

electric fields occurring in the substrate, 
in which the thin-film component (14, 15, 16, 17)
is arranged above the source metallization plane

(11), which is insulated from the thin-film
component by the insulation layer (13),
in which the power component has a cell structure,
a plurality of source regions (6), which each

adjoin a channel region (5), adjoining the main
area, and the channel regions (5) likewise

adjoining the main area on which gate dielectric
(7) and gate electrode (8) are arranged,
in which the gate electrodes (8) are connected to
one another via a gate connection plane,
in which an insulating layer (9) is arranged
between the gate electrodes (8) and the gate

connection plane, on the one hand, and the source
metallization plane (11), on the other hand, and

insulates the gate electrodes (8) and the gate
connection plane from the source metallization

plane (11) .
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,

in which the continuous source metallization plane is
formed from a high-temperature-resistant conductor.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,

in which the source metallization plane (11) is formed
from tungsten or a metal silicide.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
to 3,

in which the dielectric insulation layer (13) has a
planar surface on which the thin-film component or

components (14, 15, 16, 17, 18) is or are arranged.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
to 4,
 
in which at least one thin-film transistor is provided

as the thin-film component.
