<ABSTRACT>
The tilt switch/incline indicator of the invention 
consists of a support member (2) that is connected to the game 

cabinet in a known orientation. A second member (14) is pivotably 
supported on the first member and can be fixed relative thereto 

at angles corresponding to the desired angle of incline of the 
playfield. The second member supports a pendulum-type tilt 

switch (22-34) similar to that used in the prior art. The pendulum 
(24) acts 

like a plumb line to give a visual indication to the game 
operator that the playfield is at the desired angle set at the 

second member by observing when the pendulum is centered relative 
to the contact. The mechanism of the invention uses the tilt 

switch as the level indicator such that the playfield can be 
positioned at a known angle without requiring a separate level 

indicator or the recalibration to the tilt switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates
to a combination tilt switch and playfield
incline indicator, and a method of setting the angle of inclination
of a playfield.The typical pinball game includes an inclined playfield
supporting a plurality of play features, a rolling ball and
player operated flippers for directing the ball at the play
features. Pinball games are typically found in arcades and other
similar public places where players pay to play the games. It is
known that in an attempt to prolong play, players will lift the
game to tilt or redirect the ball to their advantage.In order to prevent such abuse, game manufacturers have
developed tilt prevention mechanisms that terminate play of the
game or at least the current ball when the game is tilted.
Such a mechanism in know from US-A-2 072 510.
These
mechanisms typically include an electrically conductive member
suspended from the game cabinet in pendulum fashion and an
electrical contact surrounding the conductive member. When the
game is tilted, the free end of the member swings into the
electrical contact and completes a circuit directing the game's
microprocessor to stop play. A properly installed playfield of a typical pinball
game is optimally angled at 6-7° relative to the horizontal to
provide challenging game play and to maximize profits. By
adjusting the height of the legs of the pinball cabinet, the game
operator can change the angle of the playfield to accommodate
slanted floors and the like or to increase or decrease the
difficulty of the game. To assist the operator in making these
adjustments, some games are provided with a level indicator
similar to those found on a typical carpenter's level. For games
that do not include such an indicator, the operator must use a
separate level or similar device to determine the angle of the
playfield. As will be apparent, providing a level indicator on
the game increases the cost of the game while omitting such an
indicator makes the set up of the game more time consuming and
complicated.Moreover, after the operator adjusts the angle of the
game, the tilt prevention switch must be recalibrated to ensure
that the pendulum hangs in a proper position relative to the
associated electrical contact. Thus, such tilt switches are
typically provided with slot and screw arrangements that allow
them to be reoriented relative to the game to accommodate changes
in the playfield angle. Again, such adjustments are cumbersome
and time consuming. Moreover, game operators, in an attempt to
simplify the process, have been known to

A tilt switch apparatus (11) for a pinball game of the type having a cabinet (3)
supporting an inclined playfield (10) and having means (7) for adjusting the angle of

inclination of the playfield (10) to a desired angle, the tilt switch apparatus
comprising:


a pendulum (24) and a contact (34) spaced therefrom such that if in use the playfield
(10) is tilted during game play the pendulum (24) touches the contact (34) to produce

a signal, characterised in that;
said pendulum (24) and contact (34) are supported by a support member (14)
which in use is mounted for pivoting movement relative to the playfield (10) and means (19,

20, 2, 15, 42) are provided for in use locking the support member (14) at an angle relative to
the playfield (10) corresponding to a desired angle of inclination of the playfield (10);

   whereby in use the playfield (10) is at said desired angle of inclination when the
pendulum (24) is visually centred relative to the contact (34).
The apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the pendulum (24) and the
contact (34) form part of an electrical circuit that is completed when the pendulum

(24) touches the contact (34).
The apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said support member in use
(14) is mounted for pivoting movement about an axis that is oriented parallel to the

axis about which the playfield (10) may be tilted.
The apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said support member in use
(14) is supported on a sidewall of the cabinet (3).
The apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said means for
locking (19, 20, 2, 15, 42) includes visual markings (8) indicative of the desired angle

of inclination of the playfield (10). 
The apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said means for
locking (19, 20, 2, 15, 42) includes a second support member (2)

which in use is
secured to said

cabinet (3), said first support member (14) being supported on said second support
member (2).
The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said first support member (14) is
pivotable relative to said second support member (2).
The apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7, further including means (16)
for fixing the first support member (14) to the second support member (2).
A method for setting the angle of inclination of the playfield (10) of a pinball
game and for detecting tilting of the game away from said angle the method

comprising the steps of:

a) mounting a support member (14) for pivotable movement relative to
said playfield (10);
b) locking said support member (14) at an angle relative to said playfield
(10), said angle corresponding to the desired angle of incline of the playfield (10);
c) mounting an electrically conductive pendulum (24) and an electrical
contact (34) on said support member (14) such that when the playfield (10) is tilted
