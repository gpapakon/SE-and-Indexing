<ABSTRACT>
An ink ribbon cartridge (1) including a 
cartridge housing (2) having a first side wall (11) and 

a second side wall (12) opposed to each other. The 
cartridge housing has a pair of first engaging portions 

(11c) on an inside surface of the first side wall (11). 
A supply spool (30) and a take-up spool (40) are 

rotatably disposed between the first and second side 
walls (11,12) in spaced relation and carry an ink ribbon 

(50) wound thereon. The spools have first end portions 
(32,42) formed with flanges (33,43) and second end 

portions (34,44) opposed to the first end portions 
(32,42). The flanges (33,43) have second engaging 

portions (33c,43c) engageable with the first engaging 
portions (11c). U-shaped leaf springs (60) are disposed 

between the second side wall (12) and the second end 
portions (34,44) of the spools (30,40) and bias the 

first end portions (32,42) of the spools against the 
first side wall (11). The U-shaped leaf springs (60) 

include base portions (61) and annular portions (62,63) 
extending from the base portions (61), respectively. 

The base portions (61) have openings (61a) receiving the 
second end portions (34,44) of the spools (30,40), 

respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink ribbon
cartridge for use in a color printer, specifically in a
color printer of a sublimating and thermal transfer type.Ink ribbon cartridges for a color printer are
well known in the art. Generally, the ink ribbon
cartridge includes a supply spool and a take-up spool
rotatably disposed in a cartridge housing. The spools
carry an ink ribbon connected at its both ends with the
spools and wound thereon. The ink ribbon has a plurality
of color regions arranged in series. Each of the color
regions includes color segments, for example, yellow,
magenta, cyan, and the like. The cartridge housing, the
spools, and the ink ribbon are made of different kinds of
synthetic resin such as HIPS (high impact polystyrene),
PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or the like. A metal
coil spring is interposed between a wall of the cartridge
housing and one end of each of the spools and biases the
spool against the wall.Related Japanese Patent Applications No. P05-015037
and No. P05-195046 have been filed but
unpublished.Upon installation of the spool in the prior art
ink ribbon cartridge, the coil spring mounted on the end
of the spool must be installed in compressed state on the
corresponding wall of the cartridge housing. This
installation work is not easy nor convenient.In addition, the prior art ink ribbon cartridge
is generally of a disposable type. When the ink ribbon
cartridge is disposed of, the metal coil spring must be
separated from the cartridge housing made of synthetic
resin. Similarly, the ink ribbon, the cartridge housing,
and the spools, which are made of different kinds of
synthetic resin from each other, must be separated upon
melting for reuse. For instance, specifically in the 
case of the cartridge housing and spools made of HIPS,
great heat energy of 15,000kcal/kg is generated when they
are melted in an incinerator. This great heat generation
leads to damage to the incinerator.US-A-5 110 228 describes various designs of ink
ribbon cassette all having integral resilient members
biasing first ends of ribbon supply and take-up spools
such that the opposite ends of the spools are urged
against the opposing wall of the cassette housing. In
certain designs, the resilient members take the form of
U-shaped elements each connected to the cassette housing
at one end thereof and pressing against a spool end at
the free end thereof. The provision of these resilient
members integrally with one of the cassette housing
portions renders the moulding of the relevant cassette
housing
