<ABSTRACT>
An infusion catheter (100) with an elongate tubular body having proximal and distal ends and a lumen extending between the ends through which a diagnostic, therapeutic, or vaso-occlusive agent can be delivered, is disclosed. The elongate tubular body is formed of a relatively stiff tapered proximal segment (122), a relatively flexible and strong distal segment (120), and a transition section (124) that is less flexible than the distal segment but more flexible than the proximal segment. The infusion catheter is directed to the target site by means of the flow of blood to that site.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLOW DIRECTED CATHETERField of the InventionThe present invention is in the general field of surgical instruments and relates specifically to infusion catheters that are used in cardiovascular and endovascular procedures to deliver diagnostic, therapeutic or vasoocclusive agents to a target site (the target site being accessible by a tortuous path through the vasculature) . The invention also relates to the process of using the infusion catheter.BackgroundCatheters are being used increasingly as a means for delivering diagnostic or therapeutic agents to internal target sites that can be accessed through the circulatory system. There are a number of general approaches for placing catheters within vessels in the body that are difficult to access. In one such technique, a torqueable guidewire is alternately rotated and advanced to the target site. With the wire in place, the catheter is then advanced along the wire until the distal end of the catheter is positioned at the target site. .An example of this technique is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,884,579. A major drawback to this approach is the time-consuming nature of rotating and advancing the guidewire and catheter through the vasculature.A second technique for advancing a catheter to a target site is to employ a highly flexible catheter having an inflatable, but pre-punctured balloon at its 

distal end. In use, the balloon is partially inflated, and carried by blood flow into the target site. During placement, the balloon is continually inflated to replenish fluid leaking from the balloon. This technique, too, has major drawbacks including the fact that the catheter material is so floppy that it cannot be pushed without buckling, and instead must be advanced using injected fluid to inflate the balloon in order to propel the catheter to the target site. Additionally, there is a significant risk of rupture of a vessel by a balloon that has been overinflated.In order to address some of the above described problems, another approach has involved the use of flexible catheters that can be directed to a target site as a result of the blood flowing to that site. In 1991, Target Therapeutics released a product known as the "ZEPHYR" flow-assisted infusion catheter. The product was designed to be introduced into the vasculature through a guiding catheter and then allowed to be directed by the blood flow to a target site. The catheter comprised segments of different materials, a proximal segment made of nylon, and middle and distal segments made of a block
