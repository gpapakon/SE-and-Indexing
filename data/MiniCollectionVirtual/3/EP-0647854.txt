<ABSTRACT>
A fail-safe current sensor and a rotation sensor of a motor using the current sensor. A first transformer (T1) 
for applying a high frequency signal, a second transformer (T2) for detecting the high frequency signal and a motor 

(1) constitute a closed circuit. The first and/or second transformer has a saturable magnetic core (C1, C2). The 
transformer equipped with the saturable magnetic core gets into saturation by a current flowing during the rotation of 

the motor, the high frequency signal from a signal generator (11) is not transmitted, and the output of a receiver (12) 
takes a logic value 0 for a warning. The transformer does not get into saturation when the motor is at halt, and the 

output of the receiver takes the logic value 1 and represents safety. The output of the receiver assumes the logic value 
0 for a warning when disconnection occurs in a motor power feed line.

<DESCRIPTION>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to a current sensor for detecting current
flowing in a current line. Such a sensor is, for instance, known from US-A-4 071 871. There an overheat
sensor switch in a motor effects an impedance change in a RF circuitry. The change is
used to establish a resonant condition indicating the occurrence of a fault. A second aspect of the present
invention relates to a motor rotation sensor which utilizes such current sensor,
for detecting whether or not a motor is rotating (including rotation under inertia).FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a conventional current sensor applied to
sensing rotation of a motor. The operation of this sensor is as follows.The current sensor is constructed such that a high frequency signal
generated by a signal generator 2 is transmitted from the primary winding N1
of a transformer T to the secondary winding N2 which is formed from a portion
of a motor 1 current line, and is also transmitted through the tertiary winding
N3 to a receiver R0. When a current flows in the motor drive circuit which
comprises a power source E, a switch SW and the motor 1, then the core C of
the transformer T which is made from a saturable magnetic body, becomes
saturated causing a drop in the level of the high frequency signal transmitted to
the receiver R0 side. Hence the output of the receiver R0 which comprises an
amplifier 3, an envelope detector 4 and a level tester 5, becomes an output
condition of logic value 0 indicating that the motor is rotating. When a current
does not flow in the motor drive circuit, then the core C no longer becomes
saturated so that the high frequency signal is transmitted to the receiver R0
side without a drop in level. Consequently the output from the receiver R0
becomes an output condition of logic value 1 indicating that the motor is
stopped. Moreover, a resistor R is provided in parallel with the motor 1, so that
while the motor 1 is rotating under inertia immediately after switching off the
switch SW, the current generated in the motor 1 flows through the transformer 
T via the resistor R and the transformer T becomes saturated. Thereby, also
when the motor 1 is rotating under inertia, a signal of logic value 0 indicating
that the motor 1 is rotating is produced from the receiver R0.The abovementioned conventional current sensor however has the
disadvantage in that, since if a disconnection fault occurs in the resistor R this
cannot be detected, there is the possibility of erroneous generation of an
output indicating that
