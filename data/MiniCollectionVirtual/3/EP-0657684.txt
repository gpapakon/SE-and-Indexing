<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a corrosion-resistant construction element, such as a tank, pipeline or the like for exhaust-gas purification systems or the like, comprising a metallic substrate, produced in particular from steel, which is clad on its surface intended for use with a rubber layer of a thickness of about 2 - 10 mm by means of a layer of adhesive. In order to provide a corrosion-resistant construction element which not only has a chemical resistance to acids and salts and a high resistance to abrasion but with which it is also ensured that no diffusing gases and salts can reach the substrate consisting of steel, there is arranged between the surface (3) intended for use of the substrate (2) and the rubber layer (7) an intermediate layer (4) of plastic based on a reactive resin having a glass transition temperature of at least 45 DEG C and a thickness of at least 0.3 mm.

<CLAIMS>
Corrosion-resistant component (1) for waste-gas purification plants, consisting of 
a supporting body (2) made of metal, in particular steel, covered on its working 

surface (3) by way of an intermediate layer (4) of plastic based on a reactive resin 
and an adhesive layer (6) with a rubber layer (7) having a thickness of 2 - 10 mm, 

characterised in that the reactive resin has a glass transition temperature of at least 
45°C and a thickness of at least 0.3 mm and an outer layer (10) of a thermoplastic 

having a thickness of at least 0.1 mm is additionally arranged on the rubber layer 
(7). 
Component according to claim 1, characterised in that the intermediate layer (4) is 
formed of vinyl ester resins, unsaturated polyester resins or epoxy resins. 
Component according to claim 2, characterised in that the intermediate layer (4) 
contains fillers with a barrier effect, such as flake glass or mica. 
Component according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
intermediate layer (4) has a thickness of 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm. 
Component according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer layer (10) is 
formed on fluorine-containing thermoplastics. 
Component according to claim 5, characterised in that the outer layer (10) is 
formed of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride or copolymers of 

tetrafluoroethylene with ethylene or other monomers. 
Component according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer layer (10) is 
formed of fluorine-free polymers. 
Component according to claim 7, characterised in that the outer layer (10) consists 
of polypropylene, polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride. 
Component according to one of claims 1 or 5 to 8, characterised in that the outer 
layer (10) consists of thermoplastic webs pretreated by chemical etching, flame  

 
treatment, the application of a bonding agent or the application of woven fabric or 

a knitted fabric. 
Component according to claim 9, characterised in that the joins between the 
individual thermoplastic webs are filled by means of a reactive resin with a glass 

transition temperature of less than 20°C. 
Component according to claim 10, characterised in that the joins are filled with a 
reactive resin based on polybutadiene/polyisocynate, polysulphide or silicone. 
Component according to claim 9, characterised in that the joins between the 
individual thermoplastic webs are filled by means of a sealant based on butyl 

rubber.
