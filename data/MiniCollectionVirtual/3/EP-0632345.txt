<ABSTRACT>
An image fixing apparatus includes a heater (1);
a detector (7) for detecting a temperature of the heater;

a controller for controlling electric power supply to
the heater (1) to provide a predetermined constant

temperature detected by the detector (7); a rotatable
member (2) heated by the heater; a pressing member (4)

cooperable with the rotatable member (2) to form a nip
through which a recording material (3) is passed through;

and wherein the controller is capable of switching the
predetermined temperature as one recording

material (3) is being passed through the nip.
Optionally the thickness of the sheet is detected upstreams of the nip

to thereby control the predetermined temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image fixing apparatus for heat-fixing an unfixed image on a recording material, usable with an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, printer or the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, an image fixing device is used in which a recording material carrying an unfixed toner image is passed through a nip formed between a rotatable member and a pressing member, by application of heat. In such an image fixing device, the fixing property is maintained in many cases by constant temperature control for the rotatable member contactable with the unfixed toner image or a heating member.Referring to Figure 3, there is shown an example of such an image fixing device, which is of a film heating type, wherein a constant temperature control is effected for the heater.In the Figure, reference numeral 1 designates a ceramic heater; 2 is a rotatable fixing film press-contacted to the ceramic heater 1 to fix the toner image formed on the recording material 3; 4 is a pressing roller for urging the recording material 3 and the fixing film 2 to the heater 1. At a position where the pressing roller 4 and the fixing film 2 are press-contacted, the toner on the recording material 3 is fixed on the recording material. The recording material 3 is guided by a guiding member 5 to the contact position 6 (nip) between the pressing roller 4 and the fixing film, and is heated by the heater 1 to fix the toner image on the recording material.The temperature of the heater 1 is controlled, using a thermister 7 bonded by bonding material or grease or the like of high thermal conductivity, on a backside of the heater 1. The fixing film 2 is guided by a guiding member 8 so as to permit smooth rotation of the fixing film.In the Figure, rotation of the fixing film 1 and the movement of the recording material 3 are effected by the pressing roller 4. The pressing roller 4 is rotated by an unshown driving source. Because of the press-contact between the pressing roller 4 toward the heater 1 surface, the fixing film 2 is rotated by the rotation of the pressing roller 4.The fixed recording material 3 is fed to a discharging roller 10 by a guiding member 9 to the outside of the apparatus.The description will be made as to the control of the heater 1. The heater 1 is normally in the off-state, and is rendered on upon instruction of the printing. The heater 1 is directly pressed on the nip through a thin PI film having a thickness of approx. 60 Âµm, and therefore, the heat transfer

<CLAIMS>
An image fixing apparatus, comprising:

a heater (1,16); a rotatable member (2,17) heated by said heater (1);
a first detecting means (7,18) which detects a temperature T
A
 of said heater (1) or of said rotatable member (2,17);
a control means which discriminates whether the temperature T
A
 reaches a target temperature T
A0
 and controls an electric power supply to said heater (1) so that the temperature T
A
 is maintained at said target temperature T
A0
;
a pressing member (4) cooperable with said rotatable member (2,17) to form a nip through which a recording material (3) is passed;
a second detecting means (14) which detects a temperature T
B
 of said pressing member (4);
characterized in that

said control means further changes the target temperature T
A0
 on the basis of the detected temperature T
B
 detected by said second detecting means (14) during the passage of one recording material through the nip.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control means changes the target temperature T
A0
 to a high level when the detected temperature T
B
 is low.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said second detecting means (14) detects the temperature T
B
 for every
 predetermined time period during the passage of one recording material through the nip.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said rotatable member (2,17) is in the form of a film.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said pressing member (4) comprises an elastic roller.
