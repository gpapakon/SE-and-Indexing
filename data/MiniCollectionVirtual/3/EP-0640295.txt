<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for chilling a food product which includes a food 
distribution device having a pair of circular members including at least one 

spaced-apart partition defining a food receiving area; the circular members 
rotating to cause food delivered to the food product receiving area to fall into a 

food storage compartment in a uniform manner; and a cryogen releasing device 
connected to one of the circular members which uniformly distributes a 

cryogenic substance to the food product within the food storage compartment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a device for chilling a food product in which
the food product is uniformly distributed within a food receiving vessel while simultaneously
being uniformly treated with a cryogenic substance delivered at a rate corresponding to the
rate of throughput of the food product into the food receiving vessel.Commercial procedures for treating freshly killed poultry or meat generally require that the
temperature of the fresh killed product be reduced in accordance with standards established
by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Conventionally, the fresh killed
product is treated with brine to lower the temperature of the food product to about 7°C
(45°F). This procedure reduces water loss in the product, prevents the growth of bacteria
and extends the shelf life of the food product.The brine treated product is then cut and/or ground as desired prior to packaging. The
culling/ grinding step generates heat thereby increasing the temperature of the food
product. Prior to packaging the food product, however, it is necessary to lower the
temperature of the food product in the range of from about -1°C to 4.5°C (about 30°F to
40°F).Conventional methods of chilling the food product after it has been cut/ground and treated
with brine involve manual operations. Specifically, the food product is placed in a large,
often times rectangular vessel. Dry ice in the form of pellets is shovelled into the vessel to
lower the temperature of the food product to meet USDA requirements.Such manual systems, however, are inefficient and inconsistent. The shovelling of dry ice
into the receiving vessel often produces localised cold spots so that a portion of the food
product is chilled to lower than necessary temperatures while other portions of the food
product remain above desired temperatures.
EP-A-242619 discloses a device comprising a rotating drum formed with a number of
compartments around its periphery, and means for successively loading each compartment
with predetermined amounts of a cryogenic fluid and products to be frozen; as the drum
rotates, the frozen products all out of the compartment. To date, there is no apparatus or method which uniformly distributes the food product within
the storage vessel and uniformly treats the food product with a coolant as it is distributed
within the vessel.A system for uniformly distributing a food product within a food receiving vessel while
simultaneously uniformly treating the food product with a cryogenic substance is

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (2) for chilling a food product (4) comprising:

a food storage compartment (10) for receiving the food product (4) from a food
distribution means (12);
the food distribution means (12) being operatively engaged to the top of the food
storage compartment (10) for receiving the food product (4) from a source (6) and

adapted to distribute the food product (4) uniformly within the food storage

compartment (10);
cryogenic releasing means (60) for releasing a cryogenic substance onto the food
product (4) in a uniform manner to cool the food product (4); and
means for adjusting the rate at which the cryogenic substance is released in
accordance with the rate at which the food product (4) enters the food storage

compartment (10), characterised in that the food distribution means (12) comprises:
a first circular member (16) having an upper and lower surface (22, 24) and an
opening (26) therein sufficient for the food product (4) to pass therethrough;
means (46) for rotating the first circular member;
a second circular member (18) positioned above the first circular member (16)
comprising at least one partition (20) and together with the upper surface (22) of the

first circular member (16) forming at least one food receiving area on the upper
surface (22) of the first circular member (16); and
means (40) for rotating the second circular member (18) in a non-congruent manner
with respect to the first circular member (16);
whereby the food product (4) which is placed on the upper surface (22) of the first
circular member (16) is caused to fall through the opening (26) in the first circular 

member (16) into the food storage compartment (10) when one of said partitions
(20a) contacts the food product (4) and urges said food product into said opening

(26); and
in that the cryogen releasing means (60) is attached to the underside of the first
circular member (16) and is adapted to release the cryogenic substance as the first

circular member (16) is rotated above the storage compartment (10).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the rate adjustment means
comprises a scale (86) for measuring the weight of the food product (4) entering the

food storage compartment (10), means for generating a first signal corresponding to
the weight of the food product, means for converting said signal into a second signal

which is readable by the cryogen releasing means (60) whereby a set amount of the
cryogenic substance is released into the food storage compartment (10).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the means (46) for rotating
the first circular member (16) rotates the first circular member (16) at a speed

different than that of the second circular member (18).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2 characterised in that the means (46) for rotating
the first circular member (16) rotates the first circular member (16) in a different

direction than the second circular member (18).
Apparatus as claimed in claims 2, 3 or 4 characterised in that the cryogen releasing
means (60) comprises a conduit (62) affixed to the lower surface of the first circular

member (16) and connected to a source of a cryogenic substance, and a releasing
means operatively connected to the conduit (62) and to the scale (86) for releasing

the cryogenic substance as the first circular member (16) is rotated.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that the releasing means (60)
comprises a solid flake generator (68). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that the releasing means (60)
comprises a plurality of openings (70) in the conduit (62) of sufficient size to enable a

liquid cryogen to pass therethrough.
