<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns mixed-type check-out counters for 
supermarkets, i.e. with two stations for the self-service recording by the 
customers and an intermediate station for the cashier. In particular, the 
invention concerns a check-out counter of said type suitable to be placed 
side by side with two bag-dispensing devices and including a barrier 
protecting the access to the bags and a scanner with relevant monitor and 
keyboard, as well as a conveying device situated before the cashier 
station. It is known that check-out counters of the above-cited mixed type 
have recently been introduced in supermarkets and similar points of sale, 
also including a pair of devices for dispensing plastic bags to the 
customers and allowing them to easily introduce the purchased items in 
said bags kept open by the device. Such a check-out counter is 
described, for example, in the European patent application 0 531 265. in 
the name of the Applicant. Said known counters, in which the cashier 
station is situated between two conveyor belts in series, while significantly 
reducing the formation of queues at the check-out, yet is not free from 
drawbacks. In fact, the cashier is positioned behind the scanner monitors 
directed towards the customers, i.e. out of their visual range. If the 
customers make mistakes or do not promptly understand the meaning of 
the message appearing on the monitor, the cashier cannot properly help 
them. Moreover, the presence of the conveyor belt and of the bag-dispensing 
device side by side between the cashier and the customer 
often makes the payment operations difficult because of the distance from 
the cashier to the customer, especially when bulky items are placed on 
the conveyor belt. Relevant prior art is also disclosed in EP-A-0 403 670 Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a mixed-type 
check-out counter, wherein the cashier position is such as to allow 
her to better assist the customer. This object is achieved according to the 
present invention by means of a check-out counter having the 
characteristics cited in claim 1.  
 The check-out counter according to the present invention has the 
advantage of allowing the vision of the monitor, besides to the customer, 
also to the cashier, so that she can easily check both the customer's 
operations and the messages on the monitor. Another advantage of the check-out counter according to the present 
invention is that the distance between the cashier and the customer is so 
short as to allow the
