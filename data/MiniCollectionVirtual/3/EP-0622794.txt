<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a tape cassette mounted 

with an IC memory (105) and an IC connecting system provided in a 
recording and reproducing apparatus for the tape cassette. 

The tape cassette is provided with a recess on the back 
side of the cassette. The recess has at least a round corner 

at a distal end thereof. The IC memory package has a 
rectangular shape with at least a round corner and with a 

cutout portion at a corner other than the round corner and 
a terminal portion on the package. wherein the IC memory 

package is mounted in the recess by causing the round corner 
of the IC memory package to be snugly fitted with the round 

corner of the recess. The connecting system is used for 
electrically connecting the terminals of the IC memory to 

the apparatus when the tape cassette is loaded into the 
apparatus. The IC connecting system has a connector 

including electrically conductive pressure contact members 
having one ends for connecting the terminals of the IC 

memory under pressure and the other ends connected to an IC 
drive circuit in the apparatus. The IC connecting system 

also automatically controls the connecting operation so as 
to obtain a reliable connection between the terminals of 

the IC memory and the contact member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette for use
with a magnetic cassette tape recording and/or reproducing
apparatus, in particular, relates to a tape cassette mounted
with an IC memory package and an IC connecting device and
system for electrically connecting an IC memory built in the
IC memory package to the magnetic cassette tape recording
and/or reproducing apparatus.Generally, a tape cassette to be used with a magnetic
recording and/or reproducing apparatus such as a video tape
recorder comprises a housing, a pair of reels having a
magnetic tape being wound and rotatably provided in the
housing and a detecting portion provided at a back side of
the housing for preventing the magnetic tape from being
erroneously erased. Further close to the detecting portion
at the back side thereof, there is provided a recess. and a
label on which a title and contents of recorded programs of
the magnetic tape are written with characters, is adhered in
the recess for indicating the recorded contents at a glance
without reproducing the magnetic tape.This kind of tape cassette is widely used as a domestic 
use, wherein the tape cassette is repeatedly used by causing the recorded
contents of the magnetic tape to be erased except for a case where an
everlasting preservation of the recorded contents is intended.When the recorded contents of the magnetic tape are erased and new
contents are again recorded in the magnetic tape, the label has to be replaced
with a new one, which poses an inconvenience in making use of the tape
cassette.In addition, with remarkable advance of the magnetic tape, a long time
recording has been realized on the magnetic tape, which causes a problem that
all the recorded contents there of can not be sufficiently described on the label.It is known from published patent application WO-A-91/02355 to
mount a memory unit in the recordlock hole of a standard cassette and to use a
sensor head for detecting whether the recordlock hole is open or closed. This
document is used for the delimitation of appended claim 1.Accordingly, a general object of the present invention is to provide a
novel and useful tape cassette in which the above disadvantage has been
eliminated.A more specific object of the present invention is to provide an IC
memory package suitable for being mounted in a tape cassette at a
predetermined position in a recess provided at a rear surface of the
tape cassette, said IC memory package having a rectangular shape and having
an IC memory built therein and a terminal portion having
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An IC memory package (105) suitable for being mounted in a tape cassette
(1) at a predetermined position in a recess (102, 109) provided at a rear

surface of the tape cassette (1), said IC memory package (105) having a
rectangular shape and having an IC memory built therein and a terminal portion having a first array of terminals; characterized in that

the memory package (105) has a substantially flat shape with four corners at
least one of which has a visually distinct marker to distinguish it from the

other corners with the memory package mounted near the recordlock hole of
the tape cassette.
A tape cassette (1) provided with an IC memory package (105) according
to claim 1 having a housing (101), a pair of reels (4a, 4b) rotatably provided in

the housing (101) for winding a magnetic tape (3) on said pair of reels (4a,
4b), a preventing means (104, 107) provided at a rear side of the housing (101)

for preventing the magnetic tape (3) from being erroneously erased, a recess
(102, 109) formed at a position nearby the preventing means on the rear side

of the housing, characterized in that the recess defines approximately a
rectangular shape formed with at least round corners at a distal end thereof;

and the cassette includes a terminal portion (106) provided on a surface of the
IC package for electrically connecting said IC memory package (105) to an

outer terminal connector means (34) of a magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus (10), wherein the IC memory package is mounted in the recess

causing the round comers of the IC memory package (105) to be snugly fitted
with the round corners of the recess.
A tape cassette (1) provided with an IC memory package (105) according
to claim 1 having a housing (101), a pair of reels (4a, 4b) rotatably provided in

the housing (101) for winding a magnetic tape (3) on a pair of reels (4a, 4b), a
preventing means (104, 107) provided at a back side of the housing (101) for 

preventing the magnetic tape (3) from being erroneously erased, a
recess formed at a position nearby the detecting means on the back side of the

housing for receiving said IC memory package;
said first array of terminals contacting a second array of

terminals (34) on a tape cassette recording and reproducing apparatus (10)
when the tape cassette is loaded into the apparatus (10) characterised by said first array of

terminals including a ground for the IC memory and said second array of
terminals including a power source terminal for supplying a power source to

the IC memory, wherein said first array of terminals is laid out that the ground
terminal (106d, 106e) is so located as not to contact said power source terminal

when said IC memory package is mounted in wrong orientation in the
predetermined position of the recess (102, 109).
