<ABSTRACT>
A digital video tape recorder (200) records a teletext signal together with a digital video 
signal on a magnetic tape (40). The teletext signal is extracted from a broadcast video 

signal (BS) and recorded in the form of binary data in auxiliary data areas of a video 
signal recording region in each recording track on the magnetic tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video tape recorder capable
of recording and reproducing teletext signals together with video
signals.It is known to broadcast teletext data multiplexed with
a broadcast television signal. The teletext data may represent
characters for providing information such as news, weather
forecasts, traffic information, quiz programs, characters to be
superimposed on the broadcast video picture and so forth.
Moreover, it has been known since the end of 1985 to broadcast
teletext data multiplexed with a broadcast television signal in
which the teletext data represents graphic patterns and/or
additional audio information as well as characters. The teletext
data also may include codes representing bit-mapped graphics.Teletext broadcasting systems are in operation in North
America (the NABTS system), England and France, but there are
minor differences among the respective systems. A teletext
broadcasting system is also in operation in Japan, but the
Japanese system differs from the systems just mentioned in that
the Japanese system is capable of broadcasting teletext codes
representing sound and Japanese characters, while the other
systems are not. The term "teletext" originally arose with
respect to the North American, English and French systems, which 
are all oriented toward transmitting text in a 26-character
alphabet, but all of the teletext systems referred to above are
fundamentally the same, and will therefore be collectively
referred to herein as "teletext broadcasting" systems.In order to prevent the teletext broadcast signal from
disturbing the video and audio signal included in the television
broadcast signal, the teletext broadcast signal is multiplexed in
the vertical blanking period of the television broadcast signal.
At the current time in the Japanese system, the teletext
broadcast signal is included in 8 lines of each frame, namely
lines 14, 15, 16, 21, 277, 278, 279 and 284. According to an
existing standard, it is contemplated that up to 16 lines (lines
10-16, 21, 273-279 and 284) may be used.According to standards for teletext broadcasting in the
European countries, up to 32 lines may be used for the teletext
broadcast signal (lines 7-22 and 320-35), but in practice, each
broadcasting station uses different ones of these lines for the
teletext broadcast signal, while using others of these lines for
a VPS signal, a test signal or the like.Fig. 16 illustrates a format in which teletext
broadcast information is provided in a video line according to
the Japanese teletext
