<ABSTRACT>
The molded component (200) which is tufted with filament 
tufts (205) has a configured one-piece construction having both 

chemical and physical properties which contribute to the 
straightness of the finished brushware (206) and result in the 

working ends of the tufts having the same configuration as the 
surface being cleaned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the manufacturing of fused brushware
products.Many different types of brushware and methods for their manufacture
have been devised over the past few centuries starting with ordinary tree and
shrub branches, and developing into wire-set, anchor-set, staple-set, twisted-in-wire
and resin-set designs including both natural and synthetic filament
materials. Not until the method of fusing like materials, e.g. polypropylene
monofilament onto a molded section of polypropylene, has the basic
brushware configuration changed. Many U.S. Patents, e.g. Nos. 3,604,043;
4,189,189; 4,291,431; 4,348,060; 4,690,277; and 4,693,519 issued to
John C. Lewis, Jr., disclose tufted fused brushes and mat like devices wherein
synthetic filament tufts are fused to molded base sections.According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided
a method of manufacturing a fused brushware device, comprising:
determining a desired final shape for a tuft surface of the brushware device;
molding a thermoplastic tuft base which includes the tuft surface, the molded
shape of the tuft base being self-supporting and such as to give the tuft surface 
an initial shape which is convexly or concavely curved and is different to the
desired final shape; and subjecting the tuft base to a single heating and cooling
cycle during which (i) the tuft base is differentially heated so as to heat the
tuft surface, (ii) filament tufts are fused to the tuft surface and (iii) the tuft
base is permanently distorted by the differential heating and the cooling so as
to distort the tuft surface from its initial shape to the desired final shape.The fusing process causes the tuft base (e.g. brushware block) to first
expand (take a set or curvature) and, upon cooling, to shrink past its original
(molded attitude) shape so that the tuft surface adopts the desired final shape.
Because the working ends of the tufts will also generally have the desired final
shape of the tuft surface, there is no need to trim the working ends of the tufts
to make them conform to the shape of the surface that is to be cleaned. There
is also no need to lengthen the manufacturing process by subjecting the
brushware device to a second heating and cooling cycle which merely corrects
the shape of the tuft surface.The components of the brushware device may be made from the same
raw material, e.g. polypropylene resin, so as to be recyclable at some later
time. There can be instances where there would be a need to fuse unlike 
materials, e.g. a

A method of manufacturing a fused brushware device, comprising:

determining a desired final shape for a tuft surface (203, 401,
507', 601) of the brushware device;
molding a thermoplastic tuft base (200, 400, 500, 600) which includes
the tuft surface, the molded shape of the tuft base being self-supporting and

such as to give the tuft surface an initial shape which is convexly or concavely
curved and is different to the desired final shape; and
subjecting the tuft base (200, 400, 500, 600) to a single heating and
cooling cycle during which (i) the tuft base is differentially heated so as to

heat the tuft surface, (ii) filament tufts (205, 403, 506, 607) are fused to the
tuft surface and (iii) the tuft base is permanently distorted by the differential

heating and the cooling so as to distort the tuft surface from its initial shape
to the desired final shape.
The method of claim 1, wherein the tuft surface (203, 401, 507', 601)
is elongate in the direction of a surface axis and the distortion of the tuft

surface from its initial shape to the desired final shape involves substantially
only a change of curvature along the surface axis.
The method of claim 2, wherein the initial shape of the tuft
surface (203, 401, 507') is convex along the surface axis and the desired final

shape of the tuft surface is substantially straight along the surface axis.
The method of claim 2, wherein the initial shape of the tuft
surface (601) is concave along the surface axis and the desired final shape of

the tuft surface is more concave along the surface axis than the initial shape.
The method of claim 3 or 4, wherein during said heating and cooling
cycle the tuft base (200, 600) is placed in a straightening device (204, 204',

606) which elastically deforms the tuft base so as to straighten the tuft surface,
and the filament tufts (205, 607) are fused to the straightened tuft surface. 
A method of fabricating a fused brushware device, comprising:

molding a curved thermoplastic block (200, 400, 500, 600) having a
deflection ratio of 0.020 to 0.060 and a tuft surface (203, 401, 507', 601)

with a first configuration which is convexly or concavely curved;
subjecting said molded block to straightening prior to fusing whereby
said tuft surface is given a se
cond configuration;
picking synthetic thermoplastic filament tufts (205, 403, 506, 607),
melting said tuft surface and fusing said filament tufts onto said tuft surface;

and
allowing said fused block (200, 400, 500, 600) to cool so that said tuft
surface permanently distorts to a third configuration;

   whereby there results a fused brushware device wherein the working
ends of said tufts also generally have said third configuration.
The method of claim 6, wherein said molded block (200, 400,
500, 600) and filament tufts (205, 403, 506, 607) are made of the same

thermoplastic resin, resulting in a brushware device that is recyclable.
The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein said third configuration is planar.
