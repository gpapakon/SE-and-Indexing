<ABSTRACT>
An optical data storage system comprises a multiple data 
surface medium (12) and optical head. The medium (12) comprises a 

plurality of substrates (50, 56, 62, 68, 74) separated by a light 
transmissive medium (78). Data surfaces (90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 

102, 104) are located on the substrate surfaces. A layer of a 
semiconductor material is deposited onto each of the data surfaces. 

The thickness of the semiconductor layer determines the amount of 
reflectivity for each of the data surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical data storage
systems and more specifically to a storage system having multiple
data storage surfaces.Optical data storage systems provide a means for storing great
quantities of data on a disk. The data is accessed by focussing a
laser beam onto the data layer of the disk and then detecting the
reflected light beam. Various kinds of systems are known. In a
ROM (Read Only Memory) system, data is permanently embedded as
marks in the disk at the time of manufacture of the disk. The data
is detected as a change in reflectivity as the laser beam passes
over the data marks. A WORM (Write Once Read Many) system allows
the user to write data by making marks, such as pits, on a blank
optical disk surface. Once the data is recorded onto the disk it
cannot be erased. The data in a WORM system is also detected as a
change in reflectivity.Erasable optical systems are also known. These systems use
the laser to heat the data layer above a critical temperature in
order to write and erase the data. Magneto-optical recording
systems record data by orienting the magnetic domain of a spot in
either an up or a down position. The data is read by directing a
low power laser to the data layer. The differences in magnetic
domain direction cause the plane of polarization of the light beam
to be rotated one way or the other, clockwise or counterclockwise. 
This change in orientation of polarization is then detected.Phase change recording uses a structural change of the data layer
itself (amorphous/crystalline are two common types of phases) to record
the data. The data is detected as changes in reflectivity as a beam
passes over the different phases.Some of these optical disks use thin films to optimize performance.
See for example IBM TDB, Vol.33, No. 10B, March 1991, p. 482; Japanese
patent application 61-242356, published October 28, 1986; and Japanese
patent application 4-61045, published February 27, 1992.In order to increase the storage capacity of an optical disk,
multiple data layer systems have been proposed.GB-A-2 017 379 discloses a multiple data layer
optical data storage disk according to the preamble
of claim 1. Partially reflecting dielectric layers on the data
surfaces are made in such a way , that the light received
by the reading head is substantially the same for each
of the data surfaces.European patent
application EP-A-0130329 discloses an optical data storage disc having,
in addition to the data recordable layer, a transparent substrate with
preformed structural
