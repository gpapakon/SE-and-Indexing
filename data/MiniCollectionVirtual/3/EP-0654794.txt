<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiation image
storage panels and methods for preparing radiation
image storage panels. The invention more particularly
relates to a radiation image storage panel having an
overcoat layer of a miscible blend of vinylidene
fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer and poly((methyl
or ethyl)methacrylate).A radiographic phosphor panel contains a layer
of phosphor, a crystalline material which responds to
X-radiation on an image-wise basis. Like many other
crystalline materials, radiographic phosphors have a
crystal matrix which allows for the replacement of some
atoms by other similar atoms, but does not readily
accept other atoms or moieties. Radiographic phosphor
panels can be classified, based upon their phosphors,
as prompt emission panels and image storage panels.Intensifying screens are the most common
prompt emission panels. Intensifying panels are used
to generate visible light upon exposure of the
intensifying panel to X-radiation. A sheet of
photographic film is positioned to intercept the
visible light generated and commonly is pressed against
the intensifying panel within a light-tight cassette.
Other prompt emission panels operate similarly, but in
place of the photographic film have some other means
for visualizing the X-radiation.Storage panels have storage phosphors, that
have the capability of storing latent X-ray images for
later release, apparently by locally trapping electron-hole
pairs created by incident X-rays. Storage
phosphors are distinguishable from the phosphors used
in X-ray intensifying or conversion screens. In the
latter, a latent image is not stored and X-radiation 
causes the immediate release of visible light from
irradiated phosphor crystals.Radiation image storage panels are used in
computed radiography. The panel is first exposed to X-radiation
to create a latent image. The panel is then
stimulated with longer wavelength radiation, resulting
in the emission of radiation at a third wavelength.
Typically a laser having a red or infrared beam is
scanned over the panel, resulting in the emission of
green or blue radiation. The emitted light is
collected and the resulting signal is processed
electronically to produce a final image.Radiographic storage panels have a support, a
luminescent layer which includes the radiographic
phosphor, and, generally, an overcoat layer to protect
the phosphor layer. An overcoat layer is, desirably,
substantially clear and transparent to the light
emitted by the x-ray phosphor. To the extent that the
overcoat absorbs
