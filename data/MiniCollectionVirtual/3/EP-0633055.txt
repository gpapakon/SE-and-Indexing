<ABSTRACT>
Lid for paint stirring machine. This lid is provided with a conventional seal bellows (13) on the stirrer shaft (5) which bears on the boss (15) of the lid via its circular upper collar (19). It comprises a support washer (3) for the stirrer shaft, which is placed between the said boss (15) and collar (19) of the bellows, this washer conforming to a surface for receiving the additional collar of the bellows and an opposed surface for application to the boss of the lid, and being provided with at least three studs (21) on the said surface for receiving the collar, which are arranged on the periphery of the latter in application and are uniformly arranged angularly so that it cannot move laterally in relation to it, each of these studs (21) being provided with a notch shaped for receiving the said collar (19) by clipping on.

A stirrer lid of the type provided with a conventional sealing 
bellows (13) on the stirrer shaft (5), bearing against the hub (15) of 

the lid by way of its upper circular collar (19), characterised in that 
it comprises a thrust washer (3) for the stirrer shaft which is 

interposed between said hub (15) and said collar (19) of the bellows, 
said washer being shaped with a surface for receiving the collar which 

is complementary with the latter and an oppositely dispose surface for 
application against the hub of the lid, and being provided with at least 

three lugs (21) on said surface for receiving the collar, which are 
disposed on the periphery of the latter in the condition of application, 

and which are regularly disposed angularly so that it cannot move 
laterally with respect to the collar, said lugs (21) each being provided 

with a catch (23) shaped to receive said collar (19) in clipping 
relationship, the washer (3) remaining freely rotatable and laterally 

retained to the collar by said catches (23), and that it is applied 
against the hub (15) of the lid under the resilient return force of the 

bellows (13), being locked in respect of rotary movement on the hub by a 
suitable locking means (25) which is formed on the lid. 
A stirrer lid according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
washer (3) advantageously comprises two flat circular oppositely 

disposed faces, the washer being shaped with dimensions equivalent to 
those of the bellows collar (19) which is conventional flat circular. 
A stirrer lid according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that the washer (3) is of plastics material, for example 

polyethylene, whose coefficient of friction with the bellows collar 
which is also of synthetic material is low. 
A stirrer lid according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the clipping lugs (21) of the washer are formed on 

the exterior of the collar (9).  
 
A stirrer lid according to one of clad 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the clipping lugs (21) of the washer are formed on the interior of 

the collar (19). 
A stirrer lid according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that there are four clipping lugs (21) on the washer 

which are circularly distributed at ninety degrees from each other on a 
circle of a diameter which is slightly greater than that of the collar 

(19) or slightly less, subject to clearance. 
A stirrer lid according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said means for locking the washer (3) on the hub 

(15) comprises a pin (25) which is formed or fixed on the lid at the 
locations of the lugs (21) of the washer.
