<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head (100) is provided with a yoke (102) 
and a gap structure (150) coupled to a substrate (101) 

that is positioned above a magnetic medium (152). The 
gap structure (150) includes one or more lips (154A, 

154B), a first (156A) and a second (156B) ferromagnetic 
pole, and a magnetoresistive element (162). The 

magnetoresistive element (162) is removed from the air-bearing 
surface of the magnetic head (100). For the 

embodiment with two lips, the two lips define a head gap 
(164). Each ferromagnetic pole (156A) is connected to 

one lip (154A). The two poles (156A, 156B) are separated 
by a dis
tance greater than the length of the gap (166), 
and each pole has a thickness that is greater than the 

thickness of each lip. The MRE (162) is substantially 
coupled magnetically, but not electrically to the two 

poles at a location where the two poles are separated by 
a distance greater than the length of the gap (166).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to magnetic heads 
and more particularly to a planar magnetoresistive head. 
There is a constant push to increase the density of 
recorded information on a magnetic medium. As the 
density increases, the magnetic head for reading and 
writing information into the medium has to be scaled down 
correspondingly.
 
Different methods have been used to scale down the 
magnetic head. A constant theme is to reduce the size of 
a head gap but still maintain the signal-to-noise ratio 
of the head. The head gap is a gap positioned on an air-bearing 
surface (ABS) above the magnetic medium, for 
exciting and sensing magnetic transitions in the medium. One prior art method uses a magnetoresistive element 
(MRE) with one of its edges at the ABS for sensing the 
magnetic signals from the magnetic medium. 
Unfortunately, the configuration exposes the MRE to wear 
and corrosion. Moreover, the MRE usually exhibits 
asymmetric cross-track profiles, as described in "Gigabit 
Density Recording Using Dual-Element MR/Inductive Heads 
on Thin-Film Disks," written by Tsang et. al. and 
published in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Volume 
26, No. 5, in September 1990. Various attempts have been 
made to move the MRE away from the ABS and to correct for 
the asymmetry. One prior art method moves the MRE away from the ABS 
by bridging the MRE across the two arms of a magnetic 
yoke in a dual track head. The magnetic yoke with a 
write coil is for writing, and the MRE is for reading 
information. In this method, a thin-film ferromagnetic 
material is deposited on a substrate as the yoke, and 
then a thin-film Nan-Yeh type MRE is deposited away from 
the head gap of the yoke. Since the structure is in 
thin-films, relatively high reluctance paths are created  
 
from the head gap to the MRE. In this method, the yoke 
has a back gap to decrease the leakage flux in the yoke 
during the read operation. However, such a structure 
increases the susceptibility of the head to the stray 
magnetic flux in the vicinity of the head. To reduce the 
effect of the stray flux, magnetic shields are added. On 
the other hand, the shields, due to their proximity to 
the thin-film yoke and the MRE, increase the leakage 
flux. Both the high reluctance paths and the shields 
decrease the reading sensitivity. Another prior art method scales down the head gap in 
a silicon planar head and then places an MRE across the 
gap on the side opposite to the ABS so as to move the MRE 
away from the ABS. However, as the
