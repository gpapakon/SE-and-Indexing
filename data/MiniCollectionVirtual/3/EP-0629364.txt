<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fine jewelry 
diamond cut chains and to methods of manufacture thereof. Fine jewelry chains, in general, and fine 
jewelry rope chains, in particular, are well known. In US 
Patents Nos. 4,934,135 and 4,996,835, there are disclosed 
rope chains and methods for preparing such rope chains 
having reduced weight and labor costs compared with 
conventional rope chains of the same chain diameter. A 
rope chain of the prior art is illustrated in Fig. 1A. In the field of rope chains there are known both 
solid rope chains and hollow rope chains. A solid rope 
chain is a rope chain whose links are made from solid 
portions of metal, while a hollow rope chain is a rope 
chain whose links are hollow. While the general appearance 
of a rope chain is not affected by the links thereof being 
either solid or hollow, the amount of precious metal used 
in a solid rope chain of a given size is significantly 
greater than the amount of precious metal used in a hollow 
rope chain of the same size. Accordingly, a hollow rope 
chain of a given size is significantly cheaper than a 
solid rope chain of the same size. A particularly popular type of rope chain is a 
diamond cut rope chain. Such a chain comprises flat cuts 
or facets on the outer perimeter of at least some of the  
 
chain links to provide a chain with a high luster flat 
surface finish that reflects light and gives the chain a 
sparkle effect. Diamond cut facets are known to be formed 
on solid rope chains by cutting or shaving a flat facet 
from a curved section of the links. Solid diamond cut rope chains have such flat 
facets generally cut about one third or more into the 
thickness of the chain link in order to obtain a 
reasonable size flat shiny surface. In this case, the 
amount of precious metal sheared away can be as much as 
10% of the weight of the chain and although the metal 
shearings are collected and recycled, a significant amount 
of precious metal is nevertheless lost in the process. Although it is known to form diamond cut facets 
on hollow rope chains, this presents certain problems due 
to the relative thinness of the outer wall of the hollow 
links used. In some cases the outer wall may be as thin 
as 0.05 mm. Accordingly, the forming of a facet in the 
way in which facets are formed on a solid rope chain would 
at least cause severe weakening of the outer wall of the 
link and would probably make a hole therein. In US Patent No. 5,125,225 to Strobel, there is 
described the making of flat facet hollow rope
