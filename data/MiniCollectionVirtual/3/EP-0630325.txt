<ABSTRACT>
In the production of a copy material of the type having on one face (10a) thereof a coating (B) incorporating a colour-forming substance of a kind which when released onto a receptor material (F) produces a visible mark, prior to the deposition of said coating (B) a visible image (I) is applied to said face (10a) so as to be visible through the subsequently deposited coating (B) thereby, inter alia, readily distinguishing the face (10a) carrying the coating (B) from the opposite face (10b) on which a further image (II) may be required to be formed, for example when the copy material is used to make up multi-part copy sets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copy materials of the type generally referred
to as "carbonless" which generally rely on two coatings formed respectively on the
contiguous faces of superimposed sheets of material such as paper, namely a
coating containing a colour-forming substance, usually contained in rupturable
micro-capsules or similar, on the back of the uppermost sheet (usually known as
a CB sheet) and a coating of a receptor layer on the front of the lowermost sheet
(usually known as a CF sheet). Colour-forming chemicals are typically dissolved
in an oily solvent and encapsulated by well known techniques, and when such
capsules are ruptured by mechanical pressure, as by impact of a type bar of a
typewriter, the chemicals are released and react to form a visible mark on the
coating of the adjacent CF sheet.Instead of confining the colour-forming chemicals in micro-capsules,
they may be contained in oil droplets emulsified into a continuous phase coating
which is rupturable to release "the chemicals in response to locally applied
pressure.Conveniently, paper for use in such copying systems is of three types,
distinguished by their coatings, namely CB sheets having a colour-former coating
on the underside to form the top sheet of a multi-part set, receptor layer sheets
having a CF coating on the upper side to form the bottom sheet of such a set, and
optionally CFB sheets having a receptor layer coating on the upper side and a
colour-former coating on the underside to form one or more intermediate sheets
of a set where required. Such coatings are normally applied by a continuous
process to cover the entire area of the appropriate face of the sheet.In recent years, there has been a demand for printing onto such coated
paper as the recipient material in toner-based printing systems or the like in
which an image is transferred to the recipient material electrostatically, a process
sometimes known as "electronic or laser printing", or by other non-impact methods. However, where the material is, as is usually the case, cut into sheets
prior to such printing it is essential for the sheet material to be fed into the printing
apparatus with the correct face uppermost. It will be appreciated that normally a
stack of sheets is placed into a sheet feeder mechanism associated with the printing
apparatus and if the stack is placed in an inverted position relative to that required
for printing on the appropriate face of each sheet, then the production from the
entire stack of sheets will be lost. In practice the visual

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing onto sheets of a copy material of the kind having
on one face (18
a
;28
a
) thereof a coating (B) incorporating a colour-forming
substance of the kind which when released on to a receptor material (F) produces a

visible mark, and having an opposite face (18
b
;28
b
) thereof free from such coating,
including the steps of passing feed stock (10) free from said coating (B) on one

face (10
a
) thereof successively and continuously through a first work station (12) at
which a first visible image (I) is formed on said one face (10
a
) and subsequently
through a second work station (14) in which said coating (B), which is translucent,

is applied to said one face (10
a
) and over said first visible image (I), whereby said
first visible image (I) is discernable through said coating (B), severing said coated

material (10'') into a plurality of individual sheets (18;28) and forming said sheets
(18;28) into a stack (20;30) in which the faces (18
a
;28
a
) of the sheets which bear
said first visible image (I) are all directed towards the same end of the stack

(20;30), characterised by the steps of orientating said stack of sheets relative to a
printing apparatus by reference to said first visible image (I), and subsequently

passing said sheets through said printing apparatus to produce a further visible
image (II) on said opposite face (18
b
,28
b
) of said individual sheets.
A method of printing as claimed in Claim 1 wherein all of said sheets
(18;28) in said stock (20;30) have said first visible image (I) beneath the coating

(B), the stack (20;30) being orientated in relation to the printing apparatus by
reference to said first visible image (I) on said one face (18
a
;28
a
) of that sheet
(18;28) which is end-most in the stack.
A sheet of copy material made according to the method of Claim 1 or
Claim 2 and comprising a sheet (18;28) having said coating (B) on said one face

(18
a
;28
a
) thereof and on said opposite face (18
b
;28
b
) a further visible image (II)
formed thereon after the deposition of said coating (B) on said one face (18
a
;28
a
). 
A sheet of copy material according to Claim 3 wherein said first visible
image (I) is formed as a continuous or discontinuous coating or by printing or other

processes.
A sheet of copy material according to Claim 4 wherein said first visible
image extends substantially uniformly over all or part of said one face in order to

afford a substantially uniform colour which is discernable through said coating (B).
A sheet of copy material according to Claim 4 wherein, said first visible
image (I) is of a substantially non-uniform nature so as to present a pattern which is

discernable through said coating (B).
A sheet of copy material according to Claim 4 wherein said first visible
image defines alpha-numeric or other characters discernable through said coating

(B).
A multi-part set of copy material including two or more sheets of copy
material at least one of which is a sheet as claimed in any one of Claims 3 to 7.
