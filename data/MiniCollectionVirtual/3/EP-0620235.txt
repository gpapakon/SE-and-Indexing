<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a release agent for 
use on a releasing sheet of an adhesive product, such as an 
adhesive tape, an adhesive sheet or an adhesive fastening 
product, for use in a variety of fields exemplified by the 
medical, office, construction, painting and packaging fields. A releasing sheet, which is endowed with releasability 
by applying a variety of release agents to the surface of a 
paper or plastic film base member, has been called a "releasing 
paper" or a "separator" and has been widely used in adhesive 
products. The releasing characteristic is mainly provided by a 
process comprising the steps of applying an organic solvent 
solution containing a release silicone to the surface of a base, 
and either drying the solution, heat curing it or adding a 
hardening agent to a crosslink silicone resin in order to fix it 
to the surface of the base. Recently, due to the desire for a water-based emulsion 
or a solventless releasing silicone in order to overcome the 
problems of air pollution, fire hazards, maintaining worker 
sanitation and energy conservation, the quantity of this type of 
silicone being used increases year by year. However, in the 
case of the solventless silicone release agent, the crosslinking 
density must be raised because in order to minimize viscosity 
the molecular weight of the silicone is extremely small. 
Moreover, from an equipment standpoint there are difficulties in  
 
obtaining thin and uniform coatings, and accordingly there are 
problems with coating precision. On the other hand, silicone emulsion type release 
agents are very widely used particulary in Europe and America. 
However, they suffer from a multiplicity of disadvantages such 
as the undesirable penetration of the paper surface due to 
inferior film forming characteristics thereof. Therefore 
various improvements are necessary in order to achieve 
satisfactory characteristics and in order to reduce costs. As the separators must have a wide range of peel force 
from small to large to adapt to various applications, the peel 
resistance value of pure silicone contained in the conventional 
release agent in which the tapes must be stacked at the time of 
application, is too small even if the separator is applied in a 
very small quantity. In order to adequately control the peel 
resistance value, a heavy release-controlling agent comprising 
units of SiO2 and (CH3) SiO1/2, or units of CH2=CH(CH3)2SiO1/2 
is used to adjust the value. However, there arises a problem in 
that the stability of
