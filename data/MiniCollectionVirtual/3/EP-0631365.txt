<ABSTRACT>
A water cooling jacket to be disposed on the 
outer periphery of the motor frame (1) comprising an outer 

cylinder (4) and an inner cylinder (3), which are formed by 
pressing stainless steel plates and integrated into one 

unit by welding together the respective end portions of 
the outer and inner cylinders and to form a cooling water 

passage in a gap between the outer and inner cylinders 
and, the inner cylinder (3) of the water cooling jacket (20) has 

an inner diameter adapted to be press-fitted to the outer 
periphery of the motor frame, whereby the cooling water 

does not directly contact the motor frame, so that a motor 
frame even of gray cast iron will not rust, and hence the 

water cooling jacket (20) is free from the problem of reddening 
of cooling water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor comprising a water cooling
jacket and a method for forming the same. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a motor and a water
cooling jacket particularly suitable
for used in driving a vacuum pump having a structure in
which a motor shaft and a vacuum pump shaft are directly
connected to each other.Fig. 9 shows the structure of a motor having
a conventional water cooling jacket. A motor frame 1
normally made of gray cast iron has a stator 2 secured
to the inner surface of the motor frame 1. A rotor 7
is rotatably disposed to lie through the central portion
of the stator 2. Grooves 1a for a water cooling jacket
are formed on the outer periphery of the motor frame 1.
An outer cylinder 4 made of stainless steel is fitted
to the outer periphery of the motor frame 1 with an O-ring
11 interposed therebetween to seal the grooves,
thereby forming a water cooling jacket on the outer
periphery of the motor frame 1. A pair of upper and
lower sockets 5 are communicated with the grooves 1a for
supplying and discharging a cooling water to and from the
water cooling jacket. When supplied from the lower socket
5, cooling water passes through grooves 1a in the cooling
water jacket and flows out from the upper socket 5. Thus,
the cooling water cools the motor frame 1.It should be noted that in Fig. 9 the rotor 7 is
secured to a shaft 8 by press fitting. The shaft 8 is
integral with a shaft of a vacuum pump (not shown). A
thin cylindrical sleeve 6 is fitted to the inner surface
of the stator 2. The sleeve 6 is in close contact with the
stator 2. One end of the sleeve 6 is welded to a load-side
frame plate 9 closer to the vacuum pump, and the other end
thereof to a flange 10 remote from the vacuum pump. In the conventional water cooling jacket having the
above-described arrangement, cooling water flows through
the grooves la in the water cooling jacket formed on the
outer periphery of the motor frame 1 made of gray cast iron
or the like. Therefore, during long-term service, a rust
resisting paint coated on the inner surface of the grooves
la may be peeled off by the force of the flow of cooling
water, causing the inner surface of the grooves la to rust,
and thus giving rise to a problem that the cooling water
becomes red. To cope with this problem, it is necessary
to frequently repaint the inner surface of the grooves la
by removing the outer cylinder 4 and re-assembling it,
which results in an increase in repair costs.In view of the above-described circumstances, it
