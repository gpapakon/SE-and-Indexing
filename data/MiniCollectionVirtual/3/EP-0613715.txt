<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of ventilating air containing styrene, the process including:   1. A stage of adsorption on a hydrophobic zeolite containing, for example, platinum and/or palladium. 2. A stage of combustion-desorption, in which hot gases pass through the styrene-impregnated zeolite in order to [lacuna] the styrene and to burn it on the said zeolite.   and being characterised in that the zeolite is bagged in small sacks shaped like a tetrahedral milk carton.

A process for the treatment of ventilation air containing
malodorous gases particularly styrene and comprising the

following successive steps :

1) An adsorption step, wherein said gases are passed
through at least one chamber containing at least

one retention mass which is selective to styrene,
the retention mass being formed by at least one

hydrophobic zeolite, said zeolite containing
platinum and/or palladium or being mixed with a

catalyst for initiating catalytic combustion,
2) A combustion-desorption step wherein the hot gases
are passed over said zeolite containing said

substance in order to desorb and burn said
substance on said zeolite, the process being

characterised in that said zeolite is enclosed in
a plurality of individual containers which are

connected to each other, each comprising a closed
envelope which is permeable to gas and/or liquid

and whose pores are sufficiently small to retain
granular solids, each container comprising four

substantially triangular faces substantially
constituting a tetrahedron, each container further

being connected to at least one adjacent container
by one of its edges.
Process according to claim 1 wherein each container is 
connected to at least one adjacent container by one of

its edges by a common weld between two adjacent edges
of said adjoining containers.
Process according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said
container envelope is constituted by a grating or

lattice, preferably metallic, or a porous metal sheet.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said hydrophobic zeolite is prepared by

dealumination of a natural or synthetic zeolite.
Process according to claim 4 wherein said hydrophobic
zeolite is prepared by dealumination of a natural

zeolite selected from the group formed by mordenite
and clinoptilolite.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
said hydrophobic zeolite has a Si/Al atomic ratio of

at least 25.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein,
in step 2), the hot gases are introduced into said

zeolite at a temperature of between 200°C and 350°C.
