<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a copper-zinc alloy for semi-finished parts and articles which are highly stressed and subject to extreme corrosion, in particular for synchronising rings. The alloy has a composition of from 40 to 65% of Cu, from 8 to 25% of Ni, from 2.5 to 5% of Si, from 0 to 3% of Al, from 0 to 3% of Fe, from 0 to 2% of Mn, from 0 to 2% of Pb, the remainder being zinc and unavoidable impurities. The ratio of Ni:Si is about 3 to :1, the microstructure comprises at least 75% of  beta  components, the remainder being alpha components but no  gamma  components. The nickel silicides are predominantly present as spheroidal intermetallic phase. The alloy of the invention enables the achievement of very significantly higher wear resistances, for example when used as synchronising rings, than are possessed by alloys hitherto on the market.

and unavoidable impurities, 
in that the ratio Ni : Si = 3 to 5 : 1 
and in that the structure at least 75% comprises 
β-constituents, the rest α-constituents but no 

γ-constituents and the nickel silicides are present as 
predominantly round intermetallic phase. 
Copper-zinc alloy according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


it contains 43- 52% Cu, 10 - 17% Ni, 3 - 4.2% Si, 0 - 1.5% 
Al, 0 - 1% Fe, 0 - 1% Mn, 0 - 1% Pb, the rest being zinc 

and unavoidable impurities, 
and in that the structure at least 80% comprises 
β-constituents, the rest α-constituents. 
Copper-zinc alloy according to Claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that
 
it contains 44 - 49% Cu, 13.5 - 16% Ni, 3.2 - 3.9% Si, 

the rest zinc and unavoidable impurities, and in that 
the structure 100% is made up of β-phase.

unavoidable impurities, the ratio Ni : Si = 3 to 5 : 1 

and the structure at least 75% comprises β-constituents, 
the rest α-constituents, but no γ-constituents, and the 

nickel silicides are present as predominantly round 
intermetallic phase, for wrought products and articles 

which are highly stressed, are subject to extreme 
wear and tear and have a high coefficient of friction.
