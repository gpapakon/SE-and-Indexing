<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to the field of
arteriosclerosis and more particularly to the use of
imidazoles that inhibit the Ca++ activated potassium
channel in arresting endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell and
fibroblast proliferation.Arteriosclerosis is a term used to describe a thickening
and hardening of the arterial wall. It is believed to be
responsible for the majority of deaths in the United States
and in most westernized societies. Atherosclerosis is one
type of arteriosclerosis that is believed to be the cause of
most coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm and arterial
disease of the lower extremities, as well as contributing to
cerebrovascular disease. Atherosclerosis is the leading
cause of death in the United States.A normal artery typically is lined on its inner-side
only by a single layer of endothelial cells, the intima. The
intima overlays the media, which contains only a single cell
type, the smooth muscle cell. The outer-most layer of the
artery is the adventitia. With aging, there is a continuous
increase in the thickness of the intima, believed to result
in part from migration and proliferation of smooth muscle
cells from the media. A similar increase in the thickness of
the intima also occurs as a result of various traumatic
events or interventions, such as occurs when a balloon
dilatation procedure causes injury to the vessel wall. To
date, there is no proven treatment for atherosclerosis.Imidazoles are synthetic antifungal agents that are used
both topically and systemically. Indications for their use
include ringworm, tinea versicolor and mucocutaneous
candidiasis. These compounds are believed to act by 
inhibiting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell wall,
and when given topically may cause direct damage to the
cytoplasmic membrane.The fungi comprise five widely differing classes of
primitive flora, and the variation in cell physiology and
biochemistry are extreme. As a result, most antifungal
agents have a very narrow spectrum of antifungal activity.Various imidazoles have been suggested as treatments
for prostate cancer. The only one known to the applicants
to have been tested, ketoconazole, appears to inhibit, in
high doses, testicular and adrenal synthesis of steroid
hormones, including testosterone. The ability of
ketoconazole to block steroid synthesis is effective in
treating some prostate cancers because proliferation of
certain prostate cancer cells is highly dependent upon
testosterone. Thus, ketoconazole has been used as a
hormonal adjuvant for prostate
