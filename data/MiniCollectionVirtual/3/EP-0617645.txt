<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a process for immobilising organic and inorganic pollutants in contaminated soil materials in which each partial reconstruction area of a reconstruction site is purified in the best possible way by an on-site application representing no danger for the surrounding medium groundwater. With a pre-measured clay mineral content of 60 wt % or more, both organic and inorganic pollutants are reduced and immobilised by means of multiple flushing (step 12) with an alkyl ammonium compound. Whith a pre-measured clay mineral content of 60 wt % or less, the controlled insertion (step 10) of a bentonite compound (step 6) is applied and the pollutants are thus immobilised or further washed out (step 12). The process is suitable for the treatment of used materials also containing organic and inorganic pollutants.

A process for immobilising organic and inorganic 
pollutants in a contaminated soil material of a remediation 

site wherein said remediation site is subdivided in 
partial remediation areas (i) (step 1) from which representative 

samples P (i) are prepared (step 3) and chemically 
analysed (step 4), while determining and checking a 

clay mineral content (step 5), and wherein said partial 
remediation areas (i) are excavated (step 11), washed 

(step 12) and verified (step 13) dependent on said clay 
mineral content, whereby a soil material with reduced and 

immobilised pollutants and a pollutant solution are 
obtained. 
A process as in claim 1 wherein the said partial remediation 
areas are excavated (i) (step 11) when the premeasured 

clay mineral content (step 5) is 60 wt % or more. 
A process as in claims 1 - 2 wherein the said washing 
(step 12) is performed using an alkyl ammonium solution. 
A process as in claims 1 -3 wherein the said washing 
(step 12) is repeated several times until the specified 

requirements have been met. 
A process for immobilising organic and inorganic 
pollutants in a contaminated soil material of a remediation 

site wherein said remediation site is subdivided in 
partial remediation areas (i) (step 1) from which representative 

samples P (i) are prepared (step 3) and chemically 
analysed (step 4), while determining and checking a 

clay mineral content (step 5), wherein a bentonite formulation 
(step 6) is developed for each partial remediation 

area (i) and a bentonite mixing sample is prepared and 
tested (step 7), wherein such partial remediation areas  

 
(i) are excavated (step 8) and tested (step 9) and wherein 

a quality-controlled insertion (step 10) is applied whereby 
a soil material with immobilised pollutants or, by 

means of a washing (step 12), a soil material with reduced 
and immobilised pollutants and a pollutant solution are 

obtained. 
A process as in claim 5 wherein a bentonite formulation 
(step 6) is prepared for each partial remediation area (i) 

when the pre-measured clay mineral content (step 5) is 
less than 60 wt %. 
A process as in claims 5 - 6 wherein a modified bentonite 
formulation is developed (step 6) in the event that 

the result after retesting (step 9) is inadequate. 
A process as in claims 5 - 7 wherein a washing with an 
alkyl ammonium solution (step 12) is carried out in case 

of inadequate quality control (step 10). 
A process as in claims 5 - 8 wherein the said washing 
(step 12) is repeated several times until the specified 

requirements of quality control are met. 
An application of a process as in claims 1 - 9 for the 
treatment of abandoned contaminated sites containing 

organic and anorganic pollutants at the same time.
