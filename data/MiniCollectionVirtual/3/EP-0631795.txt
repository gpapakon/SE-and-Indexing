<ABSTRACT>
A gas mixing pressure regulator (26) for a closed circuit 
breathing apparatus (10) comprises a first inlet (46) to provide 

pressurized air (18) to the breathing apparatus, a pressure responsive 
demand valve for opening and closing a first inlet, a second 

inlet (40) for supplying carbon dioxide-free exhaled air to the 
breathing apparatus, and a mixing chamber (60) for mixing the 

pressurized air and exhaled air for supplying breathable air 
to the breathing apparatus. The demand valve is isolated from 

the mixing chamber by a check valve injector nozzle to prevent 
contamination thereof and is responsive to pressure demands 

from the breathing apparatus to ensure reliability, stability 
and long life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a breathing apparatus for 
use in hazardous environments and more particularly to a gas 
mixing pressure regulator for supplying breathable gas to the 
breathing apparatus. It is generally known to use a breathing apparatus 
when working under hazardous conditions or environments such 
as fighting fires. A typical breathing apparatus generally 
comprises a face mask, a supply of pressurized oxygen/nitrogen 
mixture, an inhalation tube extending from the pressurized 
supply to the face mask, an exhalation tube that receives exhaled 
air which is then directed to an exhalation chamber and through 
a scrubber assembly to remove carbon dioxide from the exhaled 
air. The carbon dioxide-free air is then mixed with a proper 
mixture of oxygen/nitrogen and is recirculated back through the 
system as breathable air. Typically, a pressure regulator is 
provided for mixing the carbon dioxide-free exhaled air with 
the proper mixture of oxygen/nitrogen from the pressurized 
supply for recirculation back through the face mask as breathable 
air.  
 Prior pressure regulators required the use of 
mechanical springs for opening and closing valves for proper 
mixture of gas from the pressurized supply and exhaled air. Such 
springs are subject to not only failure but energy loss and 
instability requiring the need for a by-pass in case of a 
malfunction. In the event of failure of the springs within the 
regulator, unregulated breathable air could flow from the 
pressurized supply directly to the face mask. Conversely, 
failure of the opposing spring can prevent flow of breathable 
gas to the mask. This latter condition must, by regulation, 
be prevented by an elaborate by-pass mechanism which this 
invention eliminates. Another problem is that, in previous designs, a 
breathing diaphragm is biased against an external spring for 
moving an inlet for supplying pressurized air to the face mask. 
Such springs have been found to be unstable and tend to move 
away from the lever during exhalation causing a delay in the 
response to the need for breathable air by the user. Yet another problem encountered with prior designs 
is that after each use the parts of the breathing apparatus 
exposed to exhaled air need to be cleaned. In prior devices, 
the sliding levers and valves were not isolated from the exhaled 
air and thus water vapor from the exhaled air as well as from 
cleaning solution contaminated the sliding levers and valves  
 
and thus adversely effected their operation leading to a delayed

A pressure regulator (26) for a breathing apparatus (10) having a source 
(18) of pressurized gas and a supply of substantially carbon dioxide-free 

air exhaled by the user of the apparatus, the pressure regulator comprising: 
a body (44), a mixing chamber (68) in said body (44) for mixing pressurized 

gas and substantially carbon dioxide-free exhaled air from the 
breathing apparatus, port means (25, 44a, 44b, 44c, 64) communicating 

with said mixing chamber (68) for discharging pressurized gas into said 
mixing chamber, a first inlet (46) carried by the body for receiving pressurized 

gas from the breathing apparatus, a valve (50) carried by the body (44) 
and isolated from said mixing chamber (68), said valve (50) communicating 

with said first inlet (46) and said port means (44a, 44b, 44c, 64) and movable 
to an open position and a closed position to control the pressurized gas 

to said mixing chamber (68), a pressure sensor (58) operably connected 
with said valve (50) and having an ambient side (60a) and a pressurized 

side (60b) responsive solely to pressure changes during inhaling by the user 
of the apparatus to open said valve (50) to discharge pressurized gas into 

said mixing chamber (68) through said port means (44a, 44b, 44c, 64) and 
to pressure changes during exhaling by the user of the apparatus to close 

said valve (50) to terminate the discharge of pressurized gas through said 
port means, a second inlet (40) carried by said body (44) and communicating 

with said mixing chamber (68) to discharge substantially carbon dioxide-free 
exhaled air into said mixing chamber (68) for mixing with pressurized 

gas discharged therein from said port means (64), and an outlet (74)
