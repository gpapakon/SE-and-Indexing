<ABSTRACT>
A symmetric multiprocessing system with a unified environment and distributed system functions provides unified address space for all functional units in the system while distributing the execution of various system functions over the functional units of the system whereby each functional unit assumes responsibility for its own aspects of these operations. In addition, the system provides improved system bus operation for transfer of data from memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved data processing system
and, in particular, to a symmetric data processing system with unified process
environment and distributed system functions.A recurring problem in symmetric multiprocessing systems of the
prior art, that is, in systems having a plurality of processes wherein any of a
plurality of multi-threaded processes may be executed concurrently or in any
sequence on any of a plurality of processors, is in providing an environment which
is unified from the viewpoint of the processes executing therein but wherein the
system functions, such as memory space management, but access, and data
management, are not concentrated in a single processor. Such concentration of
system functions, usually resulting from an attempt to present a unified processing
environment, presents fundamental limitations in the capabilities of the centralized
facility for performing such functions have an upper limit. The use of centralized
system functions frequently results in a non-unified environment in that a
centralized system cannot handle or even be aware of the requirements of each
functional unit in the system.EP-A-0479428 describes a data processing system
having a plurality of SIMMS and a memory controller for
creating signals to operate the memory modules in proportion
to the system speed. The created signals are integral(s)
of the periods of a system clock.According to the present invention there is provided
a memory controller according to claim 1. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a system incorporating the present
invention; Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a memory controller; Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a memory data path;Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a correction queue;Fig. 5 is a block diagram of adaptive memory timing logic;Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an in-order request/response queue;Fig. 7 is a block diagram of address space mapping;Fig. 8 is a block diagram of a bus access arbitration mechanism;Fig. 9 is block diagram of an I/O bridge;Fig. 10 is a block diagram of a bridge bus interface controller;Fig. 11 is a block diagram of a bridge cache;Fig. 12 is a block diagram of a bridge interface controller for a

<CLAIMS>
A memory controller (38) for controlling a plurality
of memory elements (14) in a computer system, the memory

controller including

one or more storage devices (104) for storing a
plurality of timing characteristic values (106)

representing timing characteristics of a plurality of
different memory elements, and
generating means (72) for generating timing signals
for controlling operation of the memory elements,


characterised by
a timing calculator (108) responsive to the timing
characteristic values for calculating a plurality of

timing control values representing time intervals between
memory timing events,
the timing control values including
first timing control values representing timing
events relative to the start of a memory operating cycle,

and
second timing control values representing timing
events relative to other timing events,
wherein the generating means (72) is responsive to
the first and second timing control values so that the

memory controller adaptively generates timing signals for
controlling operation of the memory elements.
The memory controller of claim 1, wherein the timing
characteristic values further represent timing

characteristics of memory data transfer buses. 
The memory controller as recited in claim 1, further

characterised by
 the memory elements operating an
interleave memory cycle and the timing control values

further representing timing events for interleaving of
memory cycles.
