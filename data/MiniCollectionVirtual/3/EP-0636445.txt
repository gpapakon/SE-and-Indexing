<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of brazing a first body (10) to a second 
body (12) and has particular application to the bonding of a composite 

abrasive compact (10) to a substrate (12). The method involves the 
steps of providing a brazing shim (18) comprising at least two zones (30, 

32) having differing melting temperatures, placing the shim (18) on 
a surface of the first body (12), placing a surface of the second body (10) 

on the shim (18) to form an unbonded assembly, applying heat to the 
assembly to cause the shim (18) to melt and allowing the assembly to 

cool to a temperature at which all the zones of the shim (18) become 
solid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the bonding of bodies together by brazing. When bodies are bonded together by means of induction brazing, it is 
found that a temperature gradient is set up in the bonding interface. A 
greater degree of heating takes place at the periphery of the interface 
than at the centre, so that when a brazing shim is used, the outer or 
peripheral portion of the shim melts before the inner or central portion. 
This leads to eventual uneven distribution of the shim material because, 
on melting, the braze material has a tendency to flow away from the 
central portion of the shim, often forming a fillet at the edge of the 
interface. While the fillet may improve bond strength locally, the 
resultant uneven distribution of braze material overall leads to poor 
bonding and creates a weak point in the bonded assembly.  
 According to a first aspect of the invention, a method of bonding a first 
body to a second body comprises the steps of: 
(i) providing a brazing shim comprising at least two 
zones having differing melting temperatures, 
a central zone having the lower of the 
melting temperatures and an outer zone, 
surrounding the central zone, having the 
higher of the melting temperatures;  
 (ii) placing the shim on a surface of the first body; (iii) placing a surface of the second body on the shim to 
form an unbonded assembly; (iv) applying heat to the assembly to cause the shim to 
melt; and (v) allowing the assembly to cool to a temperature at 
which all the zones of the shim become solid. Metals and alloys have a solidus temperature at which the metal or alloy 
begins to melt and a liquidus temperature at which the metal or alloy is 
completely molten. In this specification "melting temperature" or 
"melting point" is used in the same sense as the liquidus temperature of 
a metal or alloy. In brazing, a metal or alloy is generally heated to a 
temperature at or above its liquidus temperature and this temperature 
is known as the working temperature. According to a second aspect of the invention, a brazing shim for use in 
the above method includes at least two zones having differing melting 
temperatures, 
a central zone having the lower of the 
melting temperatures and an outer zone, 
surrounding the central zone, having the 
higher of the melting temperatures.  
 In one preferred form of the invention, the brazing shim has a central 
zone having the lower of the melting temperatures and an outer zone,  
 
surrounding the central zone, having the higher of the melting 
temperature
