<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of mixtures of synthetic crystalline magadiite and oxygen-liberating salts, which is characterised in that 1 mol of sodium water glass having a molar ratio of SiO2:Na2O = 1:(0.25 to 0.5) is mixed with from 0.1 to 0.9 mol of a compound having a pH of less than 10.5 in molar aqueous concentration as neutralising agent and the mixture is heated for from 1 to 15 hours in the presence of magadiite seed crystals at temperatures of from 373 to 523 K, in particular from 423 to 463 K, in an autoclave and, after cooling, from 0.15 to 1.5 mol of hydrogen peroxide per 1 mol of sodium water glass used is added and from the reaction suspension the solid is isolated and the dissolved materials are isolated as dry substance.

A process for the preparation of a mixture of 
synthetic, crystalline magadiite and salts which split 

off oxygen, which comprises mixing 1 mol of soda-waterglass 
which has a molar ratio of SiO
2
 : 
Na
2
O = 1 : 0.25 to 0.5 with 0.1 to 0.9 mol of a peroxide-salt-forming 
compound which has a pH of less than 10.5 in 

molar aqueous concentration, as neutralizing agent, 
heating the mixture at temperatures of 373 to 523 K, in 

particular 423 to 463 K in an autoclave for 1 to 15 hours 
in the presence of magadiite seed crystals and, after 

cooling, adding 0.15 to 1.5 mole of hydrogen peroxide per 
mole of soda-waterglass employed and isolating the solid 

and the dissolved substances from the reaction suspension 
as dry substance. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
peroxide-salt-forming compounds such as phosphoric acid, 

boric acid, silicic acid, carbon dioxide, alkali metal 
hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal hydrogen phosphate or 

sodium tetraborate are used as the neutralizing agent. 
The process as claimed in either of claims 1 or 
2, wherein the amount of neutralizing agent is metered in 

such that a ratio of SiO
2
 : Na
2
O = 4 to 15 : 1 is present 
in the reaction solution. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the hydrogen peroxide is added in the form of 

a 5 to 75 % by weight aqueous solution. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein 0.5 to 10 % by weight of seed crystals, based 

on the SiO
2
 weight content in the soda-waterglass, is added.  
 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the reaction is carried out in an autoclave at 

a molar ratio of SiO
2
 : H
2
O = 1 : (5 to 100). 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6, wherein the reaction is carried out in the presence of 

aluminum, phosphorus, boron and/or heavy metal compounds, 
such as, for example, iron. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the reaction mixture is brought to a pH of 9 

to 12 before heating. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
8, wherein the reaction is carried out continuously. 
The process as claimed in claim 9, wherein, in 
the continuous procedure, 5 to 30 % by weight of seed 

crystals, based on the SiO
2
 weight content in the soda-waterglass, 
are added. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
10, wherein peroxidestabilizing compounds such as, for 

example, magnesium silicate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid and tripolyphosphoric, pyrophosphoric or orthophosphoric 

acid, in each case in the form of their sodium 
salts, are added to the reaction suspension. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
11, wherein the solid and the substances dissolved in the 

reaction suspension are isolated as the dry substance by 
vacuum evaporation. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
11, wherein the reaction suspension is isolated as dry 

substance with a heated stream of gas at a solids 
temperature of between 303 and 363 K for example in a 

fluidized bed drier, drum drier, spray drier or 
granulator. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
11, wherein the reaction suspension is separated into a 

filtercake and filtrate, which are dried separately, and 
the resulting dry substances are mixed with one another. 
The process as claimed in claim 14, wherein some 
of the hydrogen peroxide is added to the filtrate, the 

mixture is evaporated to dryness and the residue is  
 

combined in comminuted form with the dried filtercake. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
13, wherein 1 mol of soda-water glass which has a molar 

ratio of SiO

than 10.5 in molar aqueous concentration, as neutralizing 
agent, the mixture is heated at temperatures of 373 to 

523 K, in particular 423 to 463 K, in an autoclave for 1 
to 15 hours in the presence of magadiite seed crystals 

and, in a modification of patent claim 1, the dry 
substance is isolated and 0.15 to 1.5 mol of hydrogen 

peroxide per mole of soda-waterglass employed are added 
to this dry substance.
