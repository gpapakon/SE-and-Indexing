<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coating apparatus (10) for workpieces (14), in particular vehicle bodies, comprising a coating section (12), a coating drier section (18) which follows the coating section and comprises a drying cabin arranged higher than the coating section, an inlet-side skid conveyor (26) which runs through the coating section and by means of which workpieces (14) mounted on skid frames (24) can be moved through the coating section (12) at a process feed rate for the purpose of applying the coating (16), and a drier conveying device (30) which follows the skid conveyor (26) and which conveys the skid frames (24) with the coated workpieces (14) mounted thereon through the coating drier section (18). The object is to improve such a coating apparatus in such a way that it is of simpler construction than the known coating apparatuses. To achieve this object, the proposal is that the drier conveying device (30) should be a drier conveyor (30) which follows the skid conveyor (26) and moves the skid frames (24) along a skid frame path through the coating drier section (18) at the process feed rate, that the drier conveyor should run underneath the skid frame path and that the drier conveyor (30) should receive the skid frames (24) at the conveying height of the skid conveyor (SFH), raise them by way of an oblique plane (36) to the conveying height of the drying cabin (TH) and then convey them through the latter.
