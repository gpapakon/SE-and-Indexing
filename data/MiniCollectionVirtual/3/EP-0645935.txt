<ABSTRACT>
A PAL television signal processing decoder (or encoder) has a comb filter 
with a cosine response with nulls at spatial frequencies corresponding 

respectively with U 
&
 V chrominance signals. The input signal and comb 
filter response are mixed such that between the frequency response nulls 

the input signal is added to the comb filter response and outside this band 
the two signals are subtracted. This provides improved recovery of fine 

diagonal luminance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal processing and is particularly
concerned with the separation of luminance and chrominance information in
a PAL colour television signal. The invention has application both in
encoding and decoding of PAL signals.There is a well-known technique for separating the luminance
component of a PAL signal which utilises two cascaded delays each of
approximately one video line. Such a technique is disclosed in GB-A-2
018 087 (see in particular fig. 1, which essentially corresponds to fig.1 of
the present description). The input signal and the output from the
second delay are summed. Because of the relation between the PAL colour
sub-carrier frequency and the line frequency, the phase difference between
the input signal and the signal delayed by two lines is approximately 180° so
that, in the absence of vertical chrominance detail, the chrominance
components cancel in the summing leaving a double amplitude signal
consisting substantially of luminance only. This signal can be reduced to
unity gain and subtracted from the composite signal at the output of the first
delay, to produce a separated chrominance signal. This separated
chrominance signal is band pass filtered to the required horizontal
chrominance band width and passed to a chrominance channel for further
processing. The band pass chrominance signal is subtracted from the
component signal at the first delay line output to feed a luminance channel.It is a disadvantage of this known comb filter decoder that fine
diagonal luminance information is inverted. This leads to the suppression of
luminance in the transition band of the band pass filter and to double
amplitude cross colour in the chrominance channel.It is an object of this invention to provide improved video signal
processing which overcomes or reduces the problems arising from fine
diagonal luminance.Accordingly, the present invention consists in video signal processing
means for use in the separation of luminance and chrominance information
in a PAL colour television signal, comprising a comb filter for receiving a PAL 
input signal and having a cosine frequency response with nulls at vertical spatial frequencies
corresponding respectively with U & V chrominance signals and means for
mixing the input signal and the comb filter response signal in appropriate
phase relationship and generating an output signal; characterised in that said means for mixing signals is
adapted to add within the band of spatial frequencies between said
