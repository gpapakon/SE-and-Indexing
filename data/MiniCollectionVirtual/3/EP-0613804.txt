<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sign, preferably a 
registration sign for vehicles, which sign (2) includes 

a portion or member (16) consisting of a portion of a 
film web (6) or of a row of separate film portions, 

whereby said portion (16) is provided with information 
(3), preferably registration symbols or characters for 

vehicles, while toner material (25) has been applied 
thereon by electronically variable application in an 

electronic printer. For being able to manufacture this 
sign at low costs and by means of a simple manufacturing 

method, the toner material is applied on a surface 
of said portion (16), preferably a surface (23) reflecting 

light from headlamps, by means of an electronic 
printer in the form of an ionographic printer (24) 

wherein the toner material is fixed on the surface of 
said portion (16) with pressure by a cold pressure and 

fixing method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sign for vehicles, 
which sign includes a film portion of a film web, said 
film portion being provided with registration symbols or 
characters made from toner material which is applied on a 
surface of said film portion reflecting light from headlamps, 
by means of an electronic printer, the film portion 
being located between a bottom plate and a front 
plate of such transparent material that the registration 
characters on said film portion are visible therethrough. The present invention also relates to a method for the 
manufacture thereof.  
 From the publication EP-A-0 457 544 it is previously known 
to provide registration information on registration signs 
for vehicles by means of electronic printers and according 
to a predetermined program. Hereby, the electronic 
printers transfer a toner material to a travelling web 
of material in accordance with said program, whereafter 
the toner material is fixed on said web by means of a 
fusing method, or transferred to another web of material 
and fixed thereon by a fusing method. The publication US-A-5 017 416 discloses to use an ionographic 
printer wherein the toner material is fixed on 
a surface with pressure by a cold pressure fixing method. The publication DE-A-2 549 660 discloses the use of a 
frame surrounding a sign package. However, the abovementioned publications are not disclosing 
a sign which is easy to produce, has a durable construction 
and is difficult to manipulate. The object of the present invention is therefore to produce 
a sign to a low cost and so that the construction 
of the sign is durable and difficult to manipulate. 
According to the invention this is arrived at substantially 
while the sign has been provided with the characterizing 
features of claim 1. The invention also relates to a simple method for manufacturing 
the signs defined above and this is arrived 
at according to the invention substantially by means 
of the characterizing features of claim 10. Since the toner material is fixed on a preferably light-reflecting 
surface of the sign by means of an ionographic  
 
printer with pressure by a cold pressure and fixing 
method, the sign can be manufactured using less 
complex equipment than previously while among other 
things it is no longer necessary to coordinate the rotary 
motion of a transfer drum for transferring the 
toner material with the speed of the web of material 
onto which said toner material shall be transferred. Since the frame of the sign is an injection
