<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor, in particular, to a lithographic printing plate precursor which is capable of plate-making by scanning exposure based on digital signals, high sensitivity, free of residual color and residual film phenomena, and excellent in resistance to smearing (i.e., staining) and excellent in press life.Further, the present invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of recording by an infrared laser, specifically to a lithographic printing plate precursor having a heat-sensitive layer capable of image-forming by exposure with an infrared laser.In the field of the lithographic printing plate precursor, metal supports are widely used. Above all, it is known that an oxide film can be formed when a direct electric current is turned on in an acid solution with an aluminum sheet as the anode, which is generally known as the Alumite treatment, in addition, aluminum is light weight and inexpensive. Aluminum oxide film formed on the surface of aluminum by Alumite treatment is high in acid resistance and hardness as compared with metallic aluminum, further, many minute holes called pores are formed regularly on the surface of the film structure, and the surface area by BET method (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller gas adsorption equation) steeply increases due to the pores, and so very advantageous in the improvements of hydrophilicity and the adhering property when a film is formed.In the formation of pores, an anodic oxide film is conventionally formed in an electrolyte by using a proper electrolyte, such as a sulfuric acid, and applying a direct electric current at constant current to the support. The sectional form of the pore of the anodic oxide film obtained in such a method can be seen by observing the broken-out section of the pore with an ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-900). In that case, the form of the pore is generally a pipe-like form in which the diameters at the surface mouth part and at the maximum diameter part are almost the same.Dyes, which are light-sensitive layer components, sometimes enter into such pores of the anodic oxide film and cause a phenomenon of residual color that the dyes remain even after development, and binders, which are also light-sensitive layer components, cause a phenomenon of residual film that the binders remain even after development. Therefore, techniques of sealing the pores by appropriate process to prevent the light-sensitive layer from entering into the pores
