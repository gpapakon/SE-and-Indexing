Force transmission device for a pneumatic brake-booster, comprising: 

an operating rod (8) which, starting from a position of rest, can undergo 
axial displacement through the action of an input force, said rod ending in a feeler 

(10) having an axial end face constituting a first upstream support surface (S1a); 
a pneumatic piston (5) movable in an axial direction from a position of rest 
through the action of a pressure difference controlled by the axial displacement of 

the operating rod, said piston being able to receive a minimum non-zero thrust for a 
minimum non-zero active di
splacement of the operating rod and having an annular 
axial surface which surrounds the first upstream support surface and constitutes a 

second upstream support surface (S2a), 
a reaction disk (11) having an upstream face (11a) and a downstream face 
(11b), the upstream face being intended to receive forces applied by the first and 

second upstream support surfaces, and the downstream face being intended to 
retransmit these forces, 
a thrust rod (12) having a first end (12a) fastened to a radial widening (13, 
132) which offers a first downstream support surface (S1b) bearing against the 

downstream face of the reaction disk, this rod having a second end (12b) adapted to 
apply an output force greater than the input force, and 
regulation means (50, 130) for adjusting said minimum thrust to a desired 
final value by regulation of the distance between a support surface and the 

corresponding face of the reaction disk, said regulation means comprising a cup 
gripping the reaction disk, having a screw thread, and enabling said distance to be 

modified by screwing-in or screwing-out, which can be effected downstream of the 
reaction disk, and these regulation means being designed to permit the first 

upstream support surface (S1a) to be moved away from the first end (12a) of the 
thrust rod without relative displacement of the first downstream support surface 

(S1b) in relation to the second upstream support surface (S2a), characterized in that 
said cup (130) has a cylindrical rim (131), a radial extension (132) provided with a 

central aperture and having an annular internal surface which constitutes the first  
 

downstream support surface (S1b), and an internally threaded cylindrical sleeve 
(133) which leads into the central aperture and into which is screwed the first end 

(12a) of the thrust rod, this end constituting a second downstream support surface 
(S2b). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that said regulation means 
comprise means (14) for varying the length of the thrust rod.
