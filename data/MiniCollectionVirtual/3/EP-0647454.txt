<ABSTRACT>
A rate responsive pacemaker and method of pacing, 
having circuitry for controlling the rate of change of pacing 

rate in response to varying rate sensor signals. The 
pacemaker increments or decrements pacing rate each cycle, 

the change in rate being limited as a function of pacing 
rate, rate of change of sensor rate; the magnitude of the 

difference between sensor rate and pacing rate; whether prior 
cycles ended in sense or pace events; and/or a separate fast 

response sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cardiac pacers,
and more particularly, to a rate responsive cardiac pacer
which automatically controls the speed with which pacing rate
can be changed so as to provide a more physiological response
to changing cardiac demand.The rate responsive cardiac pacemaker is now
acknowledged to provide a significant improvement over prior
fixed-rate cardiac pacemakers. Indeed, rate response
techniques have been applied to both single and dual chamber
pacemakers, and are able to control pacing rate as a function
of one or more measured parameters which are directly or
indirectly related to cardiac demand. Such measured
parameters include, for example, the physical activity or
movement of the patient, right ventricular blood pressure and
change of such blood pressure over time, venous blood
temperature, venous blood oxygen saturation, respiration,
minute ventilation and Q-T interval. A more recent advent is
the employment of two or more sensors and the use of
algorithms for obtaining an optimized sensor-heart rate
correlation function. See, for example, U.S. Patent No.
5,065,759, entitled "Pacemaker With Optimized Rate
Responsiveness and Method of Rate Control," assigned to the
same assignee as this application.
An advantage of the combined sensor approach is 
to provide a sensor response which accurately tracks cardiac
demand both during fast time period episodes and during more
stable steady state patient conditions. For example, the Q-T
parameter is very reliable as a steady state indicator of
metabolic demand, but does not respond quickly to fast
changes, such as at the onset of exercise. On the other
hand, the activity-type sensor, such as described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,485,813, issued to Anderson et al., and assigned
to Medtronic, Inc., provides a faster response to changing
patient conditions, even though it may not be as accurate an
indicator of quiescent demand.A problem that pacemaker designers have
encountered, but not yet resolved fully satisfactorily, is
that of translating sensor indications of desired pacing rate
into actual changes in pacing rate. By way of example, at
both the onset and termination of exercise the body's
physiological response is known to be different from what
accurate sensor signals would otherwise indicate. Thus, at
the onset of exercise, the heart does not increase rate as a
step function, but increases over a period of time and as a
function of the degree of exercise. Likewise, following
termination of exercise, the physiological heart rate

A rate responsive cardiac pacemaker, having a rate
controllable pulse generator (81) for generating stimulus

pulses, sensor means (77, 32) for obtaining a sensor rate (R)
which indicates desired pacing rate, and rate control means

said pulse generator to operate at a pacing rate (r),

 said rate control means having

   first means (38) for determining the rate difference
(R - r) between said sensor rate (R) and the current pacing

rate (r) of the pulse generator,

   second means (36) for determining the average of
said rate differences over a predetermined number of prior

pacemaker cycles as a measure of the change of said sensor
rate (R), and

   third means (40, 44, 46; 50, 54, 56) for determining
rate adjustment as a function of said rate difference (R - r)

and said measure of change of said sensor rate (R).

pacing rate by a calculated increment, and said third means
determines the value of said increment.
The pacemaker as described in claim 2 wherein said
first means comprises means for determining whether said

difference is positive or negative, and said third means
determines said value to be positive or negative corresponding

to whether said difference is determined to be positive or
negative. 
The pacemaker as described in claim 1, wherein said
third means comprises stored values of a rise threshold and a

decay threshold, and rise comparison means (44) for comparing
said measure with said rise threshold when said difference is

with pacing rate for a determined negative rate difference.

(44-B, 46-B) for further modifying said determined rate adjustment,

whereby the pacemaker decreases the said rate difference
more quickly.
