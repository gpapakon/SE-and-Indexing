<ABSTRACT>
The display unit comprises a fixed frame with vertical front uprights 2 supporting fixed load bars 20 that bear the front end of the display trays 22. A movable frame comprising vertical rear uprights 10 can move vertically relative to the fixed frame, and supports load bars 25 bearing the rear end of the trays 22. A motor supported by the fixed frame turns a worm gear engaged in a nut fixed to the movable frame so that, depending on its direction of rotation, the motor moves the movable frame up or down. When the movable frame is in its raised position, the trays 22 tilt forwards so that the bottles 35 which they contain are carried forwards by gravity. When the movable frame is in the lowered position, the trays 22 are tilted backwards for ease of loading, the weight of the bottles 35 carrying them towards the back. The invention makes it possible for display units normally inclined towards the front to be loaded quickly and easily.

Device for displaying articles comprising a fixed 
frame made from front (2) and rear (1) vertical uprights 

connected by crosspieces (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), rear vertical 
supporting uprights (10) which are movable vertically 

following a course which is limited with respect to the said 
rear vertical uprights (1) of the fixed frame, horizontal 

support elements (21, 26) borne by the front vertical 
uprights (2) of the fixed frame and by the movable rear 

vertical uprights (10), at least one display container (22) 
hooked with its rear part onto a said horizontal support 

element (26) borne by the movable rear vertical supporting 
uprights (10) and resting in a pivotable manner near its 

front part on a said horizontal supporting element (21) 
borne by the front vertical supporting uprights (2) of the 

fixed frame, and means (30, 31, ,32) controlling the 
vertical displacement of the movable rear vertical 

supporting uprights (10) between a top position in which the 
said display container (22) assumes a display position with 

an inclination towards the front with respect to the 
horizontal, and a bottom position in which the said display 

container (22) assumes a loading position with an 
inclination towards the rear with respect to the horizontal, 

characterised in that the movable rear vertical supporting 
uprights (10) are connected to one another by braces (11, 

12, 13) in order to form a vertically movable frame and bear 
movable guiding elements (19) which co-operate with 

complementary fixed guiding elements (16) borne by the rear 
vertical supporting uprights (1) of the fixed frame in order 

to guide the vertical displacement of the movable rear frame 
and to limit the course of this displacement. 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the horizontal supporting elements (21, 26) are formed by 

bars, the ends of which are engaged in openings provided in  
 

the fixed front vertical supporting uprights (2) and in the 
movable rear vertical supporting uprights (10). 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that 
the said display container (22) has, fixed over all the 

length of its lower face, a front fixing piece (23) having a 
part in the shape of an angle bracket (24) which receives in 

a pivoting manner the front supporting bar (21) borne by the 
fixed front vertical supporting uprights (2) and a rear 

fixing piece (28) having a part with a U-shaped profile (27) 
in which is immobilised the rear supporting bar (26) borne 

by the movable rear vertical supporting uprights (10). 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the means for controlling the vertical 

displacement of the movable frame are formed by an endless 
screw (31) which is integral in translation with the fixed 

frame (1, 2, 3, 4) and engaged in a hole (32) which is 
integral with the movable frame (10, 11, 12, 13). 
Device as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
the rotation of the endless screw (31) is ensured by an 

electrically control led motor (30). 
Device as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that 
the rotation of the endless screw (31) is control led by a 

crank. 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the said means for controlling the vertical 

displacement of the movable frame (10, 11, 121 , 13) comprise 
at least one hydraulic or pneumatic jack disposed 

between the fixed frame (1, 2, 3, 4) and the movable frame 
(10, 11, 12, 13). 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterised in that the guiding means (15) borne by the 
fixed frame (1, 2, 3, 4) comprise parallel side pieces (17) 

tied by a horizontal spindle (16), whilst the guiding means 
(15 ) borne by the movable frame (10, 11, 12, 13) comprise a 

vertical tab (18) having an axial oblong slot (9), the said 
tab (18) engaging between the said fixed side pieces (17) 

with the said spindle (16) passing through the said oblong 
slot (19).
