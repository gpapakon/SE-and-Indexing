<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a red diamond and a 
pink diamond which are suitable for decorative use, for 
example, and methods of producing the same. In general, a colored diamond has been obtained by 
irradiating a natural rough diamond with an electron beam 
and thereafter annealing the same under a vacuum for 
producing a color center in the natural diamond thereby 
coloring the same. Such a color center is formed by bonding between 
nitrogen atoms contained in the diamond crystals and 
lattice defects which are caused by electron beam 
irradiation. There also exists a color center consisting 
of only lattice defects. The type of the color center 
depends on the state of condensation of the nitrogen 
atoms. Table 1 shows relations between respective color 
centers and colors thereof.  Methods of creating the respective color centers 
shown in Table 1 and characteristics thereof are described 
in "Optical Absorption and Luminescence" by John Walker, 
Reports on Progress Physics, Vol. 42, 1979. After 
creation of such color centers, the diamonds present 
colors which are attained by superposition of original 
colors thereof with the colors shown in Table 1. Original colors of natural rough diamonds are 
classified as shown in Table 2.  In a general method, it has been impossible to obtain 
a red or pink diamond by creating a color center in a 
natural or synthetic diamond. Naturally produced colored 
diamonds rarely include pink ones, while it is difficult 
to obtain such pink diamonds in practice in consideration 
of the output quantity and the cost. On the other hand, a 
red diamond has been neither naturally produced nor 
existent. It has been impossible to color a synthetic or 
natural diamond red or pink, for the following reasons: 
(1) The type of the color center to be selected and 
the range of its concentration (absorption coefficient) to 
be selected have been unknown.  (2) The optimum color of the rough diamond for 
serving as a base has been unknown. (3) The contents of necessary production conditions 
have been unknown. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
red or pink diamond, which has been substantially non-existent 
in general. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a method of producing a red or pink diamond. A red diamond which is obtained according to the 
present invention has the following characteristics: 
(1) An absorption coefficient of type Ib nitrogen at 
500 nm is at least 0.1 cm⁻¹ and less than 0.2 cm⁻¹. (2) An absorption coefficient of an
