<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bicycle bag intended to be hung on the luggage 
carrier of a bicycle or the like, said bicycle bag being provided with two 

substantially 
-shaped 
coupling pieces (13), which are each pivotally 

coupled, about an upwardly extending pivot pin, to projecting parts (6,7) 
of a plate-shaped means extending along the rear side (1) of the bicycle bag, 

in such a manner that the coupling hooks (13) are pivotable between a 
position of rest, in which the coupling hooks (13) are substantially parallel 

to the plate-shaped means, and a position of use, in which the coupling hooks 
(13) are substantially perpendicular to the plate-shaped means, whilst a 

projecting part (6,7) is at its bottom side provided with a recess for at 
least partially receiving a rod of a luggage carrier or the like, on which 

the bicycle bag may be hung.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bicycle bag intended to be 
hung on the luggage carrier of a bicycle or the like, said bicycle bag 
being provided with two substantially Γ-shaped coupling hooks, which are 
each pivotally coupled, about an upwardly extending pivot pin, to 
a projecting part of a plate-shaped means extending along the rear side 
of the bicycle bag, in such a manner that the coupling hooks are pivotable 
between a position of rest, in which the coupling hooks are substantially 
parallel to the plate-shaped means, and a position of use, in which the 
coupling hooks are substantially perpendicular to the plate-shaped means. A bicycle bag of this type is known from European Patent 
Publica-tion No. 396183. This known construction is satisfactory per se; the 
object of the invention, however, is to bring about a further improvement 
on this known construction. According to the invention this can be achieved in that 
a projecting part is at its bottom side provided with a recess for at least 
partially receiving a rod of a luggage carrier or the like, on which the 
bicycle bag may be hung. By using this construction according to the invention 
the hooks may be relieved of forces which are exerted transversely to the 
rear side of the bag. According to a further aspect of the invention such a bicycle 
bag to be hung on a luggage carrier by means of hooks is further provided with 
a securing means mounted on the rear side of the bicycle bag by means of 
a resilient coupling means, said securing means being shaped such that  
 
when the bicycle bag is hung on a rod of a luggage carrier, it can engage 
behind and under the respective rod of the luggage carrier. As a result of this it is possible to obtain an extra 
protection of the bicycle bag not only from falling off the luggage 
carrier, but also from theft, since the bicycle bag can no longer be pulled 
off the bicycle by a random passer-by. Furthermore the bicycle bag is 
prevented from rattling while riding. The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter 
with reference to an embodiment of the construction according to the 
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic, perspective view of a 
bicycle bag according to the invention. Figure 2 is an elevational view of a plate-shaped means 
incorporated in the rear wall of the bicycle bag, with coupling hooks 
attached thereto. Figure 3 is a larger-scale side view of the plate-shaped 
means, with a coupling hook attached thereto. Figure 4 is

<CLAIMS>
A bicycle bag intended to be hung on the luggage carrier 
of a bicycle or the like, said bicycle bag being provided with two substantially 

Γ-shaped coupling hooks, which are each pivotally coupled, about 
an upwardly extending pivot pin, to a projecting part of a plate-shaped 

means extending along the rear side of the bicycle bag, in such a manner 
that the coupling hooks are pivotable between a position of rest, in which 

the coupling hooks are substantially parallel to the plate-shaped means, 
and a position of use, in which the coupling hooks are substantially 

perpendicular to the plate-shaped means, characterized in that a projecting 
part is at its bottom side provided with a recess for at least partially 

receiving a rod of a luggage carrier or the like, on which the bicycle 
bag may be hung. 
A bicycle bag according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a horizontal leg of a coupling hook is accommodated in a slotted 

recess in a projecting part. 
A bicycle bag according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that near its junction with the horizontal leg the vertical leg of a 

coupling hook is provided with a recess for receiving one end of a 
projecting part in the position in which the respective hook extends at 

least substan-tially perpendicularly to the plate-shaped means. 
A bicycle bag according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the coupling hook is provided with a nose 

which projects above the horizontal leg of the coupling hook, which nose, 
in the position in which the coupling hook is substantially perpendicular  

 
to the plate-shaped means, abuts against one end of the projecting part 

supporting the respective coupling hook. 
A bicycle bag according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that besides the hooks by which 

the bicycle bag can be hung on a luggage carrier or the like, a hook-shaped 
securing means is furthermore mounted on the rear side of the bicycle bag 

by means of a resilient coupling means, in such a manner, that when the 
bicycle bag is hung on a rod of a luggage carrier, said securing means 

can engage behind and under the respective rod of the luggage carrier. 
A bicycle bag according to 
claim 5, characterized in that the end of the resilient coupling means 

remote from the hook-shaped securing means is coupled to an attachment 
piece, which is detachably connected to the bicycle bag. 
A bicycle bag according to claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the securing means has a curved part, which is shaped in such a 

manner that said curved part can surround a rod of a luggage carrier or 
the like through more than 180°. 
A bicycle bag according to any one of the claims 5 - 
7, characterized in that one or more tooth-shaped projections are formed 

on the free end of the securing means. 
A bicycle bag according to any one of the claims 5-8, 
characterized in that near the upper end of the securing means a 

project-ing lip for taking hold of the securing means is provided. 
A bicycle bag according to any one of the claims 5 - 
9, characterized in that said attachment means is a part made of a 

resilient material, which extends along the securing means from the bottom 
end of said securing means and which is connected to the bicycle bag with 

a part which projects above the securing means.
