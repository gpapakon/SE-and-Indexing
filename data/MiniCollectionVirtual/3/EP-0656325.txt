<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of elongated 
refractory 

bodies are laminated together by placing the bodies in close 
adjacency, exposing the 

adjacent bodies to a plasma torch heat source, and moving the 
bodies longitudinal 

past the torch at a nonzero average rate which 
includes a reciprocating (e.g.,oscillatory) component to longitudinally 

spread the zone of heating. Where the 
bodies are a rod to be laminated within a hollow tube, it is 

advantageous to reduce 
the air pressure between the rod and tube, thereby eliminating 

potential contaminants 
and, at the same time, biasing the tube to collapse against 

the rod. This method is 
particularly useful in laminating overcladding tubes to core 

rods to form optical fiber 
preforms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fabrication of laminated glass bodies
such as, for example, optical fiber preforms made from tubes and rods.While potentially useful in a wide variety of applications, the present
invention evolved in the field of optical fiber fabrication. Optical fibers are thin
strands of glass capable of transmitting an optical signal containing a large amount
of information over long distances with very low loss. Optical fibers are typically
manufactured by constructing a optical fiber preform of appropriate composition
and drawing fiber from the preform.A typical preform is in the form of a concentric glass rod having a
length of about one meter and an outer diameter of 20-200 mm. The inner core of the
rod is a high purity, low loss glass such a germanium silicate glass having a
diameter of about 1-5 mm. The concentric outer cylinder, referred to a cladding, is
a layer of glass with a lower index of refraction than the inner core.In conventional manufacture of a optical fiber preform, the core is
manufactured a a solid doped silica glass rod within the cladding. An outer jacket
of silicate glass, referred to a the overcladding, is then added around the rod in order
to provide the desired geometry for fiber draw. Specifically, the rod is placed within
the overcladding tube, and the rod and overcladding are laminated to form a fiber
optic preform by hating the assembly with a oxyhydrogen torch.A difficulty with this process is that the lamination introduces in the
outer periphery of the overcladding OH impurities which can be deleterious to a
drawn fiber. As a consequence it is typically necessary to etch away the outer
0.5 mm of the preform with a plasma torch to eliminate the surface contaminated by
the oxyhydrogen torch. Accordingly, there is a need for a improved method and
apparatus for laminating overcladding and core rod in fiber optic preforms. European Patent Application 0 171 103 describes a method for making a
solid glass rod by reciprocating a plasma along a glass tube for collapse thereof.European Patent Application 0 244 135 describes a method for
laminating a hollow glass tube to a glass rod by placing the rod within the tube and
heating with an oxyhydrogen torch; the method disclosed comprises the features
of the preamble of claim 1 of the present invention.According to the present invention, there is provided a method as defined
in claim 1.An outer hollow glass tube and a glass rod or an outer hollow glass tube
and a second hollow glass tube, are laminated together by

<CLAIMS>
A method for laminating together a outer hollow glass tube and a glass rod or an
outer hollow bass tube and a second hollow glass tube comprising the steps of placing said rod

or second hollow tube within said outer hollow tube, applying pressure for biasing said outer
hollow tube radially inward and exposing said outer hollow tube to a heat source moving relative

to said outer tube whereby the glass of said outer hollow tube is softened and forced by said
pressure onto said rod or second tube,

said method characterized in that said heat source moving relative to said outer tube is a
plasma torch moving longitudinally in relation to said tube and rod or said tuba at a non-zero

average speed with a reciprocating motion superimposed on the overall longitudinal motion to
longitudinally spread the zone of heating.
The method of claim 1 wherein said pressure is applied by at least partially evacuating
the interior of said outer hollow tube.
The method of claim 1 wherein said hollow tube and said rod comprise silica glass.
The method of claim 1 further comprising the preliminary steps of:

forming said rod of glass including a central region of composition for the core region of
an optical fiber; and
forming said outer hollow tube of glass of composition for the cladding region of an
optical fiber.
The method of claim 1 wherein the tube of said tube and rod assembly is rotated while exposed to
said heat source.
The method of claim 1 wherein laid step of applying pressure is performed by pressurizing
the interior of said second hollow tube.
