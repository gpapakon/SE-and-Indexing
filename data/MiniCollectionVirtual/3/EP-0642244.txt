<ABSTRACT>
In a network system, a loop-shaped transmission 
path is constituted by multiplexing a plurality of 

loop-shaped transmission channels. A plurality of 
nodes are connected to the loop-shaped transmission 

path. Each of the plurality of nodes can access at 
least two channels of the plurality of channels 

multiplexed in the loop-shaped transmission path. Each 
of plurality of nodes has a loop-shaped transmission 

route which is formed via a plurality of channels and 
which does not exceed one round of the loop-shaped 

transmission path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network for
connecting a plurality of nodes using a plurality of
channels.Most of conventional networks having a plurality
of channels are constituted by a plurality of
unidirectional or bidirectional channels and a
plurality of nodes for accessing all these channels to
transmit/receive data. In such a network, high-speed,
large-capacity data transfer can be realized using a
plurality of channels. On the other hand, since each
node must execute transmission/reception processing for
all channels, processing cost is high, and the node
arrangement tends to be complicated since it requires a
large number of transmitters and receivers, and the
like.In order to eliminate the above-mentioned
drawbacks, a system for regularly selecting channels to
be accessed by nodes to decrease the number of channels
to be accessed by each node to be smaller than the
total number of channels has been proposed. A system,
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 
No. 64-24539 as an example of the above-mentioned
system, has a unidirectional loop-shaped transmitting
path obtained by multiplexing dk (d and k are natural
numbers equal to or larger than 2) channels having the
same transmission direction, and each node is arranged
to access d channels which are regularly selected. In
this arrangement, when packet transmission is performed
between arbitrary nodes, an intermediate node located
at an intermediate position between transmitting and
receiving nodes selects a channel for transmitting a
packet in accordance with a proper routing algorithm,
and repeats and transfers the packet, thus realizing a
communication even when the transmitting and receiving
nodes do not access the same channel.Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of the conventional
system when the number of channels to be multiplexed is
8, and the number of channels to be accessed by each
node is 2 (i.e., d = 2 and k = 3). Referring to
Fig. 1, loop-shaped channels 101 to 108 have a
counterclockwise transmission direction in Fig. 1.
Each of nodes 109 to 144 is connected to two channels
indicated by marks ○.In this conventional system, since the number of
channels to be accessed by each node is small, the node
arrangement can be simplified. However, the average
transmitting route length of a packet from a
transmitting node to a receiving node is always more 
than half a round of the transmitting path in the case
of a uniform traffic distribution. Furthermore, in
terms of the characteristics of the network
arrangement, the
