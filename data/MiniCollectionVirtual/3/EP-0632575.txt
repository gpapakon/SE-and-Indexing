<ABSTRACT>
A quadrature modulator multiplies two carriers 
which are 90° out of phase with each other by a sine component (I) 

and a cosine component (Q) of a baseband signal, 
respectively, adds (26) the product signals to each other, and 

amplifies (28) the sum signal to produce a quadrature-modulated 
output signal. The quadrature modulator includes a phase 

comparator (34) for detecting a phase distortion suffered when 
the sum signal is amplified, a first phase controller (1) for 

correcting the phase of a single carrier generated by a 
carrier oscillator based on a compared phase output signal 

from the phase comparator, a phase difference detector (20) for 
detecting the difference between 90° and the phase 

difference between the two carriers, and a second phase 
controller (2) for outputting the two carriers to be multiplied 

by the sine and cosine components of the baseband signal and 
controlling the phase difference between the two carriers 

generated from the single carrier whose phase distortion has 
been corrected by the first phase controller, into 90° based 

on a detected output signal from the phase difference 
detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quadrature
modulator suitable for use in digital mobile communications.
Description of the Conventional Art:Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 5-75658,
for example, discloses a conventional quadrature modulator.
The disclosed quadrature modulator has a differential converter
converting an input carrier into two carriers that
are 180° out of phase with each other, i.e., a positive-phase
carrier and a negative-phase carrier. The amplitude
ratio of the positive- and negative-phase carriers is
controlled by an amplitude ratio control circuit based on a
phase difference signal that is detected by a phase
difference detector. After the amplitude ratio has been
controlled, the positive- and negative-phase carriers are
supplied to a phase converter, which converts them into two
carriers having a phase difference based on the amplitudes
of the positive- and negative-phase carriers whose amplitude
ratio has been controlled. The two carriers outputted from
the phase converter are then limited in amplitude separately
by respective limiters. The phase difference detector then
detects the difference between 90° and the phase difference
between the amplitude-limited carriers outputted from the
phase converter. The detected phase difference outputted 
from the phase difference detector is supplied to the
amplitude ratio control circuit, which controls the
amplitude ratio so that the carriers outputted from the
phase converter will be 90° out of phase with each other.
The carriers outputted from the phase converter as they are
limited in amplitude by the limiters are multiplied by sine
and cosine components of a baseband signal, and the product
output signals are combined with each other.In the case where the conventional quadrature
modulator is implemented by an integrated circuit, any
changes in the phase relationship between the carriers,
which would otherwise be caused by characteristic variations
of circuit components and fluctuations of the constants of
circuit components due to temperature changes, are
suppressed. It is desirable that the quadrature modulator
be not affected by absolute errors of the constants of
circuit components and frequency changes of the carriers,
and that a phase distortion produced by an amplifier be
corrected when the modulated signal is amplified by the
amplifier.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a quadrature modulator which is not affected by
absolute errors of the constants of circuit components and
frequency changes of the
