<ABSTRACT>
A cathode-ray tube apparatus (CRT) including a panel 
glass (4) which has been subje
cted to no external 
polishing, and an ultraviolet-curing resin layer (11) 

provided on the panel glass (4) and having a refractive 
index which differs from that of the panel glass (4) by 

not more than 0.8 %. The CRT further includes a light-transmitting 
film (12) provided on the resin layer. Also 

disclosed is a production method which enables a 
reduction in the weight of a CRT and an improvement in 

the explosion-proof performance, which have been demanded 
with the realization of large-sized CRTs and flat-panel 

CRTs, and which also makes it possible to produce such 
CRTs by a simplified process and at a reduced cost. 

The method also includes the use of a UV-transmissive vacuum container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing a cathode-ray tube apparatus (hereinafter 
referred to as "CRT") having a film stacked on the 
surface of a panel glass. Recently, with the progress of computer simulation 
technology, it has become possible to make a practical 
strength analysis for CRTs, and large-sized CRTs and 
flat-panel CRTs, which are substantially equal to 
conventional CRTs in the bulb strength as being vacuum 
glass bulbs, have been realized by design according to 
the results of the strength analysis. Such a large-sized or flat-panel CRT suffers, 
however, from some problems as stated below. To ensure 
the required bulb strength, the panel glass must be made 
thick in comparison to the conventional CRTs, and hence 
the overall weight of the CRT unavoidably increases. If 
the wall thickness of the panel glass is merely reduced 
to minimize the overall weight of the CRT, the bulb 
strength lowers, and the explosion-proof performance 
degrades. Therefore, the existing CRTs employ a thin-walled 
panel glass and, at the same time, adopt an explosion-proof 
technique, e.g., banding, PPG laminating, resin 
bonding, etc.. Among the above-mentioned explosion-proof techniques, 
the banding method uses a panel glass which has been 
subjected to rough S/E polishing after pressing, followed 
by external polishing, which includes roughing, semi-finishing 
and finishing, and S/E polishing, thereby 
smoothing the surface thereof, and a band is fastened 
around the panel glass. The banding method includes the 
shrunk band method, the Kim chord method, the T-band  
 
method, which are classified according to the manner in 
which the panel glass is banded. Among these methods, the 
shrunk band method is the mainstream of explosion-proof 
technique because it is suitable for mass-production. The 
PPG laminating method uses a panel glass which has been 
subjected to roughing and semi-finishing as external 
polishing but not subjected to finishing as external 
polishing, and it includes the steps of placing a spacer 
on the panel glass, placing a glass plate of 2 mm in 
thickness on the spacer, carrying out taping, injecting a 
thermosetting adhesive, and setting the adhesive by 
heating. The resin bonding method uses a panel glass 
which has been subjected to roughing, semi-finishing and 
finishing as external polishing, followed by S/E 
polishing, thereby smoothing the surface thereof, and a 
resin adhesive is coated on the panel glass to form a 
resin layer. It should be noted that the
