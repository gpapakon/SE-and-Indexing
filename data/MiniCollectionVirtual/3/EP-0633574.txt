<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a recording and reproducing apparatus to which two 
tape cassettes of different sizes having supply reels and take-up reels to and 

around which respective ends of a magnetic tape are fixed and wound are loadable, 

the supply reels and the take-up reels being spaced apart by different spacings and 
in which reel turntables (18,18') that are in engagement with the tape reels are 

translated between two positions. In this recording and reproducing apparatus, an 
indirect driving in which the reel turntables are rotated by an existing motor, such 

as a capstan motor (29) or the like without using a reel motor exclusively-designed 
for rotating a reel turntable is made possible. Thus, the recording and reproducing 

apparatus can be miniaturized, made light in weight and inexpensive. Reel 
turntables (18, 18') can rotate about supporting points (16a, 16a') which are 

supported to the mechanical chassis (17) such that they can be translated between 
two positions. A drive gear (39) supported to a swing arm (38) and which is driven 

by a capstan motor (29) is selectively meshed with one of driven gears (19, 19') 
provided on the two reel turntables (18, 18'), and the reel turntable is rotated by the 

drive gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus and, more particularly, to a miniaturized,
lightweight and inexpensive recording and reproducing apparatus
to which two tape cassettes of different sizes can be loaded.There is a recording and reproducing apparatus to
which two tape cassettes of different sizes having supply reels
and take-up reels to and around which respective ends of a
recording medium tape are fixed and wound are loaded, the supply
reels and the take-up reels being spaced apart by different
spacings and in which reel turntables that are in engagement
with the tape reels are translated between two positions. This
recording and reproducing apparatus includes reel motors
exclusively designed for rotating the reel turntables in order
to translate the reel turntables between the two positions.Since the recording and reproducing apparatus includes
the motors exclusively designed for rotating the respective reel
motors as described above, there is then the disadvantage that
members for supporting the reel turntables thereon are
inevitably increased in size and weight. Further, there is then
the disadvantage that a mechanism for translating the reel
turntables between the two positions becomes complex in
arrangement.Furthermore, when two reel turntables are driven by a
single reel turntable motor or two reel turntables are
indirectly driven by using a driving force of other motor, the 
reel turntables are translated so that a mechanism for applying
a proper torque to the reel turntables and a mechanism for
detecting the rotation of the reel turntables become complex in
arrangement.In view of the aforesaid aspect, it is an object of
the present invention to provide a recording and reproducing
apparatus which can be miniaturized.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a recording and reproducing apparatus which can be made
light in weight.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a recording and reproducing apparatus which can be made
inexpensive.It is yet a further object of the present invention to
provide a recording and reproducing apparatus in which reel
turntables can be rotated by using an existing motor, such as a
capstan motor or the like, without using a motor exclusively-used
for reel turntables.It is yet a further object of the present invention to
provide a recording and reproducing apparatus in which a proper
torque can be applied to the reel turntables.It is still a further object of the present invention
to provide a

<CLAIMS>
A recording and reproducing apparatus to which two tape cassettes (1/8) of
different sizes having supply reels (6/13) and take-up reels (6'/13') to and around which

respective ends of a recording medium tape (5/12) is fixed and wound are loadable, said
supply reels and said take-up reels being spaced apart by different spacings, and in

which two reel turntables (18, 18'), that are in engagement with said two tape reels (6
6'/13, 13') in use, are translatable between two positions (B, B'/C, C'), comprising:


a pair of rotary arms (16,16') each pivotally supported on a mechanical deck
portion (17) and each having a respective reel turntable (18,18') rotatably supported

thereon, whereby rotation of a rotary arm causes translation of the respective reel
turntable between said two positions thereof (B, B'/C, C');
a drive gear (39) for rotating a selected one of said reel turntables (18,18'); and
a swing arm (38) pivotally supported to said mechanical deck portion (17), said
swing arm having the drive gear (39) pivotally provided thereon to selectively engage and

rotate a reel turntable gear (19, 19') on one of said reel turntables (18, 18') for rotating
said one of said reel turntables;

   wherein a rotary shaft (38a) of said swing arm (38) is disposed substantially
