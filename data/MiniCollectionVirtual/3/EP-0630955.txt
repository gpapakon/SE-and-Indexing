<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal polyester resin composition 
comprising (a) a liquid crystal polyester, (b) an 

aluminum powders, flakes and/or fibers, and if necessary 
(c) titanium oxide and/or talc, has high heat resistance 

and a small thermal storage even when exposed to high 
temperatures, and thus is useful for producing a lamp 

reflector hardly deformed by heat from a halogen lamp, 
etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in one aspect to the use of a
liquid crystal polyester resin composition for producing a lamp
reflector,
said liquid crystal polyester resin composition having
high heat resistance, and a small thermal storage even if
one surface of a molded article is exposed to relatively
high temperatures caused by exposure to light from a
halogen lamp, etc., and thus showing little deformation
of the molded article and in another aspect to a liquid crystal
polyester resin composition for a lamp reflector.Lamp reflectors, particularly head lamp
reflectors for cars, have been made from a metallic
material such as a steel plate, etc. and a glass
material. But from recent tendency of attaching great
importance to the exterior and design of cars, head lamp
reflectors are to be required to have different designs
depending on different kinds of cars. Therefore, resin
materials which are excellent in molding processability
and can be designed freely are going to be noticed as
materials for head lamp reflectors.As one of such resin materials, there is
partially used a bulk molding compound (BMC), that is,
unsaturated polyester reinforced with glass fibers,
inorganic fillers, etc. due to its advantages in heat
resistance and material cost. But the BMC also has 
problems in that it is not suitable for recycling and it
generates flashes at the time of molding, resulting in
requiring a troublesome aftertreating step.Now, thermoplastic engineering plastics such as
polycarbonates and polyphenylene sulfides excellent in
molding processability are studying as a material for
producing lamp reflectors. But since lamp reflectors
made from these engineering plastics are deformed by heat
when used in halogen lamps which generate high temperatures
near light source or in projector type reflectors
which can provide a large amount of light, such engineering
plastics cannot be used for such a purpose. On the
other hand, a lamp reflector made from a liquid crystal
polyester is also deformed by heat, particularly used in
a halogen lamp or as a projector type reflector.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a liquid crystal polyester resin composition
for producing a lamp reflector which resin composition
has high heat resistance and a small thermal
storage even if one surface of a molded article is
exposed to relatively high temperatures caused by
exposure to light from a halogen lamp, etc., and thus
shows little deformation of the molded article, over
coming the problems mentioned above. One aspect of the
