<ABSTRACT>
Baffles can form a chimney-effect separating the vapor space near the center of the bath. Flow through the chimney is aided by thermal convection and, optionally, by a differential pressure between the portions of the bath on either side of the baffle-chimney arrangement. Feed is added to the feed zone and oxygen is added to the oxidation zone, emitting H2 from the feed zone and CO from the oxidation zone. Products can be mixed as syngas feed for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Additionally, the Boudouard endothermic reaction (CO2 + C -
>
 2CO) can be used to control temperatures by injecting CO2 in place of oxygen. A plural zone plant and process for converting a hydrocarbon feed (e.g. coal, automobile tires, hazardous organic wastes, such as polyhalogenated organics, organic polymers, garbage, and other hydrocarbons) to synthesis gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen is disclosed. The feed is contacted with a molten bath, which can comprise iron in an oxygen deficient zone at one pressure and reacted with water, and/or an oxygen source, in at least one other zone having higher temperature and pressure than the first zone.
