<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
industrial preparation of (6S) folic acid 
derivatives by chromatographically separating the 
diastereoisomeric mixtures thereof on a column, 
particularly it relates to a method for the 
industrial preparation of 5-(methyl)-(6S)-tetrahydrofolic 
acid and 5-(formyl)-(6S)-tetrahydrofolic 
acid herein referred as "MTHF" and 
"FTHF". MTHF and FTHF are physiological molecules 
which together with the less stable 6,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic 
and tetrahydrofolic acids 
constitute the in vivo active forms of folic acid, 
commonly named as folic acid co-factors. From the therapeutical point of view, both MTHF 
and FTHF find an application in all of the forms of 
folate-deficiencies, as general liver protective, 
and more recently, in antitumor therapies. MTHF and FTHF and the therapeutically acceptable 
derivatives thereof commonly used show the 
following formula (I): 
wherein
 
X= CH₃ or CHO and
 
R₁ and R₂ are H, NH₄⁺, alkaline and earth-alkaline 
metals, R₁ and R₂ being equal or different to one 
another. The compounds having formula I contain two 
asymmetric carbon atoms and can therefore exist in 
four diastereoisomeric forms. Usually, it is well known that when there exist 
stereoisomeric pharmaceutical forms, only one of 
them is active, the other being inactive or even 
harmful. In the present case, it is well known that 
the active forms are the (6S) ones. Some studies have been carried out as to the 
industrial preparation and/or the isolation of the 
two diastereoisomers and as to the direct synthesis 
of the (6S) form. The stereospecific synthesis of the (6S) form of 
both MTHF an FTHF, as well as the separation of the 
two (6RS) diastereoisomers have revealed to be 
difficult given the structural fragility of the 
final products. The syntheses of the stereoisomeric mixtures of 
MTHF and of FTHF have been described in the GB-A-1.572.138 
patent and in the CH-A-496.012 patent  
 
respectively. To separate the (6S) diastereoisomers of the 
mixtures so obtained, it is possible to transform 
the stereoisomeric mixture in the respective 5-methyloxy 
carbonyl derivative or into other 
derivatives having chiral centres: in such a way, 
exploiting different solubilities in appropriate 
solvents, it is possible to separate the two (6R) 
and (6S) diastereoisomers (JCS, CHEM COMM 470, 
1987; EP 0 266 042). Said method is yet somewhat complicated and the 
yields are extremely poor. Other methods of separation are based on multiple 
crystallizations either of
