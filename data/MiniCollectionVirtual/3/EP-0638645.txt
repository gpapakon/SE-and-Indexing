<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a human receptor 
protein capable of binding TRH which can be used as a 
diagnostic composition for neuropathy, a DNA comprising a 
DNA fragment coding for said protein which can be used as a 
pharmaceutical composition, a method for preparing said 
protein, and use of said protein and said DNA. TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) was discovered 
from the hypothalami as a peptide promoting secretion of 
thyroid stimulating hormone and prolactin of the pituitary 
glands [A. V. Schally et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. 
Commun., 25, 165-169 (1966)]. It has been reported that 
TRH is widely distributed in almost all sites of the brains 
other than the hypothalami, the spinal cords, the 
intestines, the pancreases, the adrenals and the like [J. 
E. Morley et al., Life Sciences, 25, 1539-1550 (1979)]. 
The fact that TRH is also distributed in the brains and the 
spinal cords suggests that TRH plays an important role in 
the function of the central nerve system. For example, the 
actual administration of TRH to organisms has been found to 
bring about various central nerve actions in animals [R. 
Guillemin, Recent Prog. Horm. Res., 33, 1-28 (1977)]. Also 
clinically, the administration of TRH has been reported to 
have therapeutic effect to schizophrenia [K. Inagata et 
al., Arch. Gen. Psychatry, 35, 1011-1014 (1978)],  
 
melancholia [C. Hatanaka et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. 
Commun., 60, 1350 (1974)], spinocerebellar degeneration [I. 
Sobue et al., Lancet, 1, 419 (1980)], as well as the 
improvement of disturbance of consciousness. Further, the 
existence of TRH in the nerve synapsis in the brains 
suggests that TRH acts as a neurotransmitter [T. Hokfelt et 
al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 34, 389-392 (1975)]. On the other hand, binding tests using isotope-labeled 
TRH reveal that TRH receptors widely exist not only in the 
pituitary glands, but also in the brains and the spinal 
cords [N. A. Sharif, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 553, 147-175 
(1989)]. Although there is a report that Scatchard plot 
analysis proves that TRH receptor molecules differ from one 
another in affinity between the pituitary and brain [K. 
Funatsu et al., J. Neurochem., 45, 390-397 (1985)], it is 
also reported that only one kind of receptor exist in the 
pituitary and brain [N. Ogawa et al., Peptides, 5, 743-746 
(1984)]. TRH receptor-cDNAs have been cloned from 
pituitary tumor cell line of mice [R. E. Straub et al., 
Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 87, 954-958 (1990)] and rats 
[P. Pena et al., Biochem. J., 284,
