<ABSTRACT>
The covering element (1) comprises a foldable material sheet (2) 
which, near two opposite sides (3a,3b) thereof, which can be mutually 

superimposed by folding the sheet about the thermally insulating 
material of the pipe, is provided with engaging means (7) which can be 

mutually connected, in order to hold the two sides of the sheet in their 
mutually superimposed relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a covering 
element for pipe thermally insulating materials, in 
particular for industrial systems. As is known, the pipes or ducts of industrial 
systems are coated, in order to prevent heat from 
being dissipated therefrom, by one or more layers 
of a thermally insulating material, such as, for 
example, rock wool, polyurethane, polystirene and 
so on. This thermally insulating material is conventionally 
pre-shaped into two half-shells, which 
are arranged about the pipe to be thermally insulated 
and are then affixed to said pipe. A further outer coating for the thermally 
insulating material is moreover conventionally 
provided, which has the double function of protecting 
the thermally insulating material from the outside 
environment, in order to prevent this material 
from being eroded, and holding the two half-shells 
of thermally insulating material in a locked 
condition about the pipe. This coating generally comprises a covering 
element, made of a sheet metal material, which  
 
is wound, by properly folding it, about the thermally 
insulating material, so as to cause the two 
opposite sides of the sheet to be superimposed onto 
one another, in order to mutually affix them 
by means of self-threading screws, or other equivalent 
locking systems. The operation of locating and locking the 
two opposite sides of the sheet metal element so 
as to mutually superimpose said sides, is very 
difficult, particularly if the sheet elements have 
a comparatively great length. In such a case, actually, in order to hold 
the two sides of the sheet metal element in their 
proper positions, before and during the application 
of the screws, it is necessary to use a great 
number of workers. On the other hand, a scarcely accurate 
superimposition of the two sides of the sheet 
metal material would provide an unsatisfactory 
coating operation, with a consequent deformation 
of the sheet material susceptible to press the 
underlaying thermally insulating material, with a  
 
consequent great difficulty in applying the affixing 
screws. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to solve the above mentioned problem, 
by providing a covering element for pipe thermally 
insulating materials, which can be applied 
in a very accurate manner and in a very short 
time, by a number of operators very reduced with 
respect to that required for applying conventional 
covering elements. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is 
to

A covering element for covering or coating 
thermally insulating materials for pipes and 

the like, in particular to be used in industrial 
systems, characterized in that said covering element 

comprises a foldable material sheet provided, near 
two opposite sides thereof which can be mutually 

superimposed by folding said sheet about a said pipe 
thermally insulating material, with engagement means 

which can be mutually coupled in order to hold said 
two sides in a mutual superimposed relationship. 
A covering element, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said engagement or locking 

means comprise hook elements projecting, near a 
side of said sheet, on the face of the sheet provided 

for facing the pipe and being adapted to be 
engaged in seats defined near the opposite side of 

said sheet. 
A covering element, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that, near said hook elements, there are provided 
a plurality of holes which can be aligned, by mutually 

superimposing the two sides of the sheet, 
 

with a corresponding plurality of holes defined on 
the opposite side of the
 sheet, the aligned holes 
being adapted to receive therein a respective plurality 

of a fixing screws. 
A covering element according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said hook elements comprise a cut-out portion which is 
bent toward the face of the sheet provided for 

facing the pipe. 
A covering element, according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said covering element comprises a row of hook elements, 
near each of the two opposite sides of the 

sheet element, the hook elements of a row being 
slightly offset, in a direction parallel to said 

sides of said sheet, with respect to the hook elelents 
of the other row. 
A covering element, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said holes for engaging therein said fixing 
screws, comprise a portion of said seats. 
A covering element, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

 
that said seats are made by cutting-out and bending 

said hook elements. 
A covering element according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said hook elements are arranged, at a groove defined 
by a contoured portion of said sheet, near the 

two mutually superimposable sides. 
A covering element according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said foldable material sheet comprises a stainless 
steel material sheet element or a sheet element 

having at least a surface thereof processed by an 
anti-oxiding treatment.
