<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED PHOSPHONATES, THE PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING THEMThis invention relates to novel phosphonates substituted with a dialkyl phenol moiety and the processes for their preparation. It further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and their therapeutic use in diseases in which reactive oxygen radicals have been implicated and more specifically in the treatment of atherosclerosis.Reactive oxygen species are involved in a number of pathologies, pharmacological and clinical evidence have been firmly established in the following cases (Halliwell, B. et al. "Role of Free Radicals and Catalytic Metal Ions in Human Disease: an Overview", Methods Enzymol.1 , 1-85, 1990):- inflammatory and immunologic injuries (autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis),- ischemia/reperfusion injury,- radiation injury, - premature ageing,- Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,- cancer and anti-cancer treatments,- conditions associated with impaired blood circulation such as intermittent claudication, excessive platelet aggregation, myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis.In these pathological situations antioxidant products would be useful as therapeutic agents. The tests performed by the inventors show that the phosphonates of formula (I) through their dialkyl phenol and phosphonate moieties display potent antioxidant activities and therefore offer this therapeutic potential.In the particular case of atherosclerosis, it is now clearly proven that cholesterol carried in LDL is the most atherogenic form of plasma cholesterol. On the other hand current research shows that the uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages leads to the formation of lipid-laden foam cells, which is the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. Numerous epidemiological studies have now firmly established that high blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Based on the above, it can be postulated that the combination of a cholesterol lowering 

regimen with an antioxidant treatment might be more effective than either one. A drug which possesses the dual hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant property could therefore be highly effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis.The phosphonate compounds (I) of this invention inhibit markedly the synthesis of cholesterol in human cell lines similarly to the HMGCoA reductase enzyme inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin) which are potent hypocholesterolemic drugs in man. The combination of their antioxidant
