<ABSTRACT>
Chimeric somatostatins are provided comprising proteins 
including a protein-carrier to which a spacer sequence 

(Sp)

sequences. The spacer sequence consists of an alkaline 

amino acid and an amino acid ensuring a rigid β-structure, 
in particular Arg-Pro or Lys-Pro, coupled to a synthetic 

sequence encoding somatostatin-14 and a stop-codon. 
DNAs coding for chimeric somatostatins comprising proteins 
and recombinant plasmid DNAs ensuring their expression in 

microorganism cells, and a method for isolation, 
purification and refolding of chimeric proteins are also 

proposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of genetic and 
particularly protein engineering, in particular to the 
preparation of chimera-derived proteins (chimeric proteins), 
the desired component of which for some reason 
cannot be obtained in a free form by microbial synthesis, 
and also because of its small size only has the properties 
of a hapten, i.e., is capable of inducing the formation of 
antibodies only after being combined with high-molecular 
carriers. In particular, the tetradecapeptide somatostatin-14 
having an amino acid sequence of AGCKNFFWKTFTSC or 
AGCKNFFNKTFFSC relates to such a genus of oligopeptides. 
The use of a chimeric somatostatin-comprising protein in an 
immunogenic composition to increase the productivity of 
farm animals is also proposed.  Acceleration of the growth of farm animals at a lower cost 
per kilogram of weight gain is one of the main problems of 
stock raising. It is known that the productivity of farm 
animals can be increased by administration of somatotropin 
or some anabolic hormones or antibiotics. However, the high 
cost of somatotropin does not always make this method profitable, 
and furthermore, the use of hormonal preparations, 
especially anabolic ones, in the production of foodstuffs 
is increasingly criticized by the public. For these reasons 
somatotropic preparations have not yet found wide use in 
stock raising, and anabolic hormones are prohibited in 
animal husbandry. However, it is possible to increase the 
concentration of endogenic anabolic factors by acting on 
their inhibitor, i.e. somatostatin, which has good prospects 
of use in agriculture and in medicine (Muromtsev, 
G.S., et al., 1990, "Basics of agricultural biotechnology", 
Agropromizdat, Moscow; Keichlin S., ed., 1989, "Somatostatin, 
Basic and Clinical Status", Plenum Press, New 
York). Somatostatin, a biologically active tetradecapeptide having 
the following amino acid sequence AGCKNFFWKTFTSC, is produced 
in the hypothalamus and the gastrointestinal tract. 
The sequence of somatostatin-14 is highly conservative 
among vertebrata, while in mammals in general it does not 
exist a specific species. Somatostatin has a strong inhibiting 
effect on a large number of hormones and functions 
of the organism related thereto: somatotropin, the thyrotropic 
hormone, insulin, glucogen, secretin, gastrin, 
pepsin, maletin and a number of regulatory peptides. The 
wide range of action of somatostatin on the factors necessary 
for growth and utilization of food provides a good 
outlook
