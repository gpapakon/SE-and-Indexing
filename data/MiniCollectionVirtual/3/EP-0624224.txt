<ABSTRACT>
A draught and weather excluder comprising a gap sealing section which enables simple, fast and effective closure of gaps below doors. The gap sealing section is particularly suited to sealing gaps below hinged and sliding doors. The sealing section is securable to the underside of a door without removal of the door and with the use of less strong but convenient fixing materials such as bonding tapes. The sealing section has two main webs (2, 3) which are connected together along the length of the section where also a hinged or weakened section (4) is provided so that the two webs (2, 3) are able to rotate so that the section being generally of a wedge shape may open and close so that a range of gaps may be sealed. The sealing section consists of a mounting web (1) enabling attachment of the sealing section to the underside surface of a door edge and a sealing web (2) to make contact with the floor surface (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention comprises a draught and weather excluder for
sealing gaps between the underside of the bottom edge of
a door and the top of a floor surface and for sweepingly
gliding freely with a door over soft floor coverings and
over small obstacles above a floor surface and for simple
and effective direct flush mounting to the underside of a
door edge without mechanical fixings or the use of tools and
without removal or modification of the door.One known type of draught excluder consists of a sand filled
cloth tube which is manually pushed against the gap below a
closed door. Such devices are bulky and cumbersome to use.
Another known type comprises a flexible brush or gasket
which is fixed to the face of the door bottom. These devices
impinge upon the visible face of a door and can mare floors.
Another known type of draught and weather excluder has two
engaging parts in which a gasket part is fixed or hinged to
the face of a door bottom and the other part is fixed to the
floor or door frame to engage or bias the gasket part
downwardly to the floor when the door is closed. These
devices can reduce the ease of operation of doors and
require screw fixings or separate cradles or biasing stops
and are limited to use on external doors. Prior art
publications relating to all of the above are not known.Another known type of draught and weather excluder is for
compressively sealing between a fixed member such as a door
or window frame and a movable member such as the side of a 
door or window and they create a seal only when the members
are brought together. Patent specifications GB,A,625755,
CH,A,223469, US,A,2247435 and EP,A,0053801 describe such
devices and wherein the sealing web is abruptly terminated
and/or is held by an obtrusive cradle. These devices in use
below a standard door edge would severely jam with soft
floor coverings or with small obstacles above a floor
surface. Patent specifications FR,A,2262187, CH,A,187957,
CH,A,219599, GB,A,1083336 and AU,A,78980/82 also describe
similar devices and without holding cradles but containing
sealing webs which are sharply or abruptly terminated.
Patent specifications GB,A,881766, EP,A,0391700,
GB,A,306786, GB,A,597336 and AU,B,35655/84 also describe
similar compression devices but which are not capable of
being directly flush mounted to the underside of a door edge
without removal or modification to the door and/or wherein
the mounting web is either screw fixed to one of a pair of
members and/or the sealing web is of a soft material which
would
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A draught and weather excluder comprising a mounting
web (1) and a sealing web (2) of stiff wear resistant

material flexibly connected to the mounting web along one of
its longitudinal edges (4), characterised in that the

mounting web is singular and planar for direct flush fitting
to the underside edge of a door and the leading edge of the

sealing web remote its connected edge is curved to form a
nose portion (5), both the perimeter of said nose portion

and said leading edge, which may be the edge of said nose portion, remote from the connected
edge of the sealing web being directed toward the plane of

the mounting web, whereby in use upon the underside of a
door (10) the sealing web depends from the mounting web and

freely engages a floor surface (9) such that whatever the
direction of motion of the door the sealing web sweepingly

glides laterally over said floor surface without jamming in
soft floor coverings or upon small obstacles above the said

floor surface.
A draught and weather excluder according to claim 1
wherein the connection edge of the sealing web comprises a

hinge or weakened section.
A draught and weather excluder according to claim 2
wherein the connected edge of the sealing web has a small

residual resilience.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein the sealing web is curved.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
claims 1 to claim 3 wherein the sealing web is configured to 

be relatively flat.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein the sealing web is formed from

a resilient material.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein an adhesive bonding means is

provided for attaching the mounting web to the underside of
a door.
A draught and weather excluder according to claim 7
wherein the adhesive bonding means includes a tape (6).
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein the mounting web contains a

small upstand (7) along its length and being directed away
from the sealing web.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein the sealing web between its

nose portion and its connected edge is adapted to provide a
longitudinal surface portion to permit tangential sweeping

contact with a soft or irregular floor surface.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein
 it is a long unitary device of
a plastics material.
A draught and weather excluder according to any one of
the preceding claims wherein the sealing web is provided

with a biasing web (3) extending from the free extremity
of the nose portion and being directed towards the connected

edge of the sealing web.
