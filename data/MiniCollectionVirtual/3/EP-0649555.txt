<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a multi-port video game controller (60) interface which provides supports for at least two multifunctional game controllers (18, 20) via a single microcomputer I/O bus connector (28). An address decoder (64) selectively enables one of the game controllers, in order to access the control input received therefrom. A program operating in the personal computer (100, 102) polls separate addresses within the game controller address space to receive input information from the different controllers. Jumper blocks (66, 68) map each of the plurality of controllers to separate and distinct addresses, in order to avoid address conflicts and provide flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTTPORT GAME CARD WITH CONFIGURABLE ADDRESSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to controllers for video games and simulators implemented on a computer and more particularly to interfacing multiple multifunctional controllers to a personal computer.Conventionally, a personal computer is enabled to be controlled by external manual control devices by means of a game card, which provides an external game port into which control devices, such as a joystick, can be plugged. To provide widespread compatibility, which is essential to the ability to mass market a wide variety of video games and simulation programs, industry standards have been developed for game cards for personal computers such as those commonly referred to as IBM- compatibles. The universal adoption of these standards means that any external manual input device designed to control such computers and software must be compatible with the industry-standard game port. Any input device lacking such compatibility will not be able to be used with conventional personal computers equipped with standard game boards and will not be widely accepted.The problem is that the industry standard game port provides only a limited number of inputs: four discrete signal inputs for receiving binary signals signifying "On" and Off' and four analog signal inputs for receiving variable voltage signals, such as output by a potentiometer, which are continuously variable over a limited range. The number of game boards that can be plugged into a conventional PC is also limited, to one. Consequently, the number of controllers supported by a standard game port, and the number of allowable functions communicated thereby, is severely restricted. For example, a PC configured as a combat aviation video 

game/simulator as shown in FIG. 1 has a joystick controller and a foot- pedal rudder controller. The joystick conventionally has a handle pivotally coupled to a base for forward/rearward movement and left/right movement by the user. The handle is connected in the base to transducers such as potentiometers coupled to two of the analog inputs of the game port to input proportional signals to the PC microprocessor to control analog functions in the video game/simulation program. The handle also includes four discrete switches that are operable by the user's fingers to control discrete functions in the video game/simulation program. The joy-stick controller therefore consumes two of the analog inputs and all four of the discrete inputs. The foot-pedal
