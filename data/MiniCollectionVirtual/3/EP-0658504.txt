<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in reeling of a paper or board web in a 
drum reel-up or equivalent, in which, when a paper or board reel (R) 

formed on a reel spool (11) becomes complete, a new reel spool (11') is 
brought by means of transfer members (32) into a stand-by position and 

accelerated up to the web speed, the reel spool (11) with the reel (R) is 
transferred by means of a transfer device into an exchange position apart 

from the reel drum (10), and the new, initially accelerated reel spool (11') 
is transferred into the reeling position (12). When the reel spool (11) with 

its reel (R) is transferred into the exchange position apart from the reel 
drum (10), the belt (F) guide roll (21) is transferred into contact with the 

reel (R) that is being formed onto the reel spool (11), that the guide roll 
(21) is displaced along with the reel spool (11) into the exchange position so 

that the web (W) runs during the entire exchange on support of the belt (F) 
and through the nip (N
3
) between the guide roll (21) and the reel spool (11). 
The invention also concerns a device in reeling of a paper or board web in 

a drum reel-up or equivalent, which device comprises a reel drum (10) and 
a reel spool (11), the web (W) being fitted to run through the nip (N) between 

said drum and said spool onto the reel spool (11), which device comprises 
a transfer device (32) for bringing a new reel spool (11') into nip 

contact against the reel drum (10) after the paper or board reel (R) on the 
first reel spool has become complete. The device comprises means for the 

transfer of the belt (F) guide roll (21), together with the reel spool (11), into 
the exchange position, so that, during the entire exchange, the web (W) is 

supported on the belt (F) and fitted to run through the nip (N
3
) between the 
guide rol
l (21) and the reel spool (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method in reeling of a paper or board web in a drum reel-up
according to the preamble of claim 1.Further, the invention concerns a device in reeling of a paper or board web in a
drum reel-up according to the preamble of claim 7.
Said preambles are based on GB-A-2 021 074.As is well known, when a web is reeled by means of a drum reel-up or an equivalent
reel-up, the web is passed on the face of the mantle of a reel drum, a reeling
cylinder or equivalent before the reeling nip, while the web forms a belt angle over
the reeling cylinder or equivalent. Problems have arisen from sliding between the
web and the reeling cylinder, which has caused fluctuation in the tension of the web.
Further, in a situation of change of full reel, fluctuations have occurred in the
tension of the web, which fluctuations may also have resulted in problems in the
process preceding the reeling.A drum reel-up is used commonly to reel the paper web that comes, for example,
from a paper machine, a coating machine, a supercalender and from a printing
machine. Therein the web is reeled onto a spool, and the reel that is being formed 
is pressed against the reel drum or reeling cylinder, over which the web runs on a
certain sector and which is rotated at a circumferential speed that corresponds to the
speed of the web. Before completion of the reel, a new spool can be brought into nip
contact with the reel drum so that it also obtains the corresponding circumferential
speed. As soon as the reel of paper has obtained the desired diameter, it is transferred
apart from the reel drum. Then its speed of rotation starts becoming lower,
which has the consequence that, between the new reel spool and the full reel, a web
loop is formed. This loop is guided, for example, by means of a compressed-air
jet
to be wound around the new reel spool, whereby it is torn apart from the full reel
of paper.As is well known, at the reeling stage, normally, the spool of the paper reel rests
and revolves on two support rails. To permit that, there are particular bearing parts
at its ends, which bearing parts also guide the transfer of the reel as it is, upon its
completion, transferred along said rails to further processing. In paper manufacture,
this further processing is usually slitting, in which the reel is cut and unwound into
smaller rolls. The returning and changing of the empty reel spools can be carried
out, for example, by means of a crane.When certain paper grades, for example LWC and SC, are being reeled, especially
at

Method in reeling of a paper or board web (W) in a drum
reel-up or equivalent, in which, when a paper or board web

reel (R), formed on a reel spool (11) in a reeling
position (12) with the help of a reel drum (10), becomes

complete, a new reel spool (11') is brought by means of
transfer members (32) into a stand-by position and accelerated

up to the web speed, the reel spool (11) with the
reel (R) is transferred by means of a transfer device

into an exchange position apart from the reel drum (10),
and the new, initially accelerated reel spool (11') is

transferred into the reeling position (12), wherein a
belt (F) is passed under guidance of guide rolls (21-29)
