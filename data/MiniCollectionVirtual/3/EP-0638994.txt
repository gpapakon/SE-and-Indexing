<ABSTRACT>
A transmitter comprises a linearised power amplifier 
circuit (18) consisting of a power amplifier output stage (28) 

having a feedback loop (34) connected between its output (32) and 
input (30). The feedback loop (34) includes a coupler (56), a 

first gain control element (58) and a feedback function stage 
(64) which collectively determine the loop gain of the 

amplifier. A second gain control element (54) is provided in the 
forward gain path of the power amplifier (18). The first and 

second gain control elements (58,54) are controlled so that the 
product of their gains is constant. As a result the loop 

parameters remain substantially constant as the power setting is 
varied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmitter or a
transmitter part of a transceiver and more particularly to the
power control of a transmitter power amplifier.Recent developments in cellular telephones has stimulated
interest in power control of a transmitter power amplifier
because in an attempt to reduce interference and economise on
battery power, output powers are regulated to be sufficient for a
receiving station to obtain an acceptable signal. A typical
transmitter power amplifier control circuit is disclosed in
British Patent Specification GB-A-2 220 808 and
comprises a power amplifier having an input, an output and a gain
control input, a directional coupler couples out a portion of the
amplifier's output signal and applies it generally as a dc
representation of the output to one input of a comparator to a
second input of which is applied a locally generated reference
power waveform, an output from the comparator is applied to the
gain control input of the power amplifier. The gain control
input normally controls the supply voltage of the power
amplifier. This type of power amplifier control is normally
applied because the amplifier architecture does not normally have
overall feedback. In fact in the interests of amplifier
stability, feedback is avoided in general practice because the
frequencies are high.In certain applications, for example TDMA digital trunking
systems, a linear power amplifier with a good overall efficiency
is required. Typically in private mobile radio non-linear (class
C) amplifiers are used which are unsuitable for digital trunking
systems. A known type of linear power amplifier architecture is
a Cartesian loop amplifier in which an input signal is
represented by orthogonal vectors I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature 
phase). US-A-5 066 923 discloses in Figure 1 a Cartesian feedback transmitter
with a gain control element in the forward gain path and a loop phase
adjustment in the feedback path, to ensure the correct operation of the
transmitter at a variety of output power levels. This arrangement has the
disadvantage of requiring the operation of a training mode before the
transmitter can be used. Another known type of linear power amplifier is a
polar loop amplifier.An object of the present invention is to linearise an amplifier by means
of a Cartesian loop or polar loop architecture.According to the present invention there is provided a transmitter having
a linearised power amplifier circuit comprising a forward gain path including a
power amplifier output stage having a
