<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus and method for transferring an article 
(20) from one conveyor (30) to another (40) and a printing system 

incorporating the same. The apparatus includes an array of endless 
conveyorized strips (11) carried by a roller (12) and a relatively rigid 

member (13), the roller and the member being positioned within the strips, 
and moving means (14) operatively associated with the roller for effecting 

its rotation and hence movement of the strips (11). The apparatus is 
positioned between and in cooperation with adjacent ends (31,41) of 

successive conveyors (30,40) of a printing system. The surface (15) of each 
strip is charactarized by a series of upwardly extending projections (16), 

each projection being of relatively small diametar in relation to its 
length. The roller (12) is adjacent to the exit end (17) of the apparatus and 

has disks (18) positioned longitudinally between the strips (11) and 
coaxially with and about the roller (12) at intervals across its width. The 

disks diameters are sufficiently greater than that of the roller as to extend 
above the projections (16), lifting the article (20) from the projections 

as it passes over the roller (12) and carrying it to the other conveyor (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing systems,
and more particularly to an improved apparatus and method
for transferring an article from one conveyor to another.Doffing of articles (such as textiles, plastic
sheets or the like) is commonly accomplished by a
revolving cylinder covered circumferentially with needle
tape, positioned in close proximity to a printing blanket,
and driven clockwise against the same speed, clockwise
rotation of the blanket. The objective is to strip
articles from the printing blanket and transfer them to a
conveyorized belt for subsequent stage(s) of printing
operations, e.g. a drying system.While needle tape has been found relatively useful
in grabbing articles, and pulling them from the blanket,
it tends to hold onto the articles when their release is
desired, for example, when transferring articles to the
conveyor belt. This has caused portions of the articles to
turn over, bunch or roll up. As a result, wet printed
images on the articles have been damaged and frequent work
stoppages required, hindering subsequent operations of the
printing system.In addition, the same speed operation (fixed R.P.M.
ratios) of the conveyor belt and blanket have been found
to not only inhibit smooth transfer, but also produce
inconsistent images with variations in weight,
orientation, shape or fiber content of the articles, and
with changes in ink, adhesive or tack.GB-A-1008026 discloses a conveyor for supporting material
to be printed wherein a plurality of endless strip-like
bands guided by guide rollers are engaged in
circumferential grooves formed in the latter to define
parallel upper runs for supporting the article. The
grooves are deeper than the thickness of the endless bands 
and pins project from the surface of the endless bands for
engagement with the articles. When the article engages
with the outer circumferential surfaces of the
corresponding roller, the article is lifted from the
bands.US-A-4176601 discloses a transfer apparatus for
screen printing work pieces including endless belt strips
with gripping pins to peelingly remove the work piece from
the printing blanket. Lifting of the workpiece from the
belt strips to discharge it onto a downstream conveyor is
accomplished by means of plates extending between each
pair of adjacent strips.In accordance with one aspect of the present
invention there is provided an improved printing system and
a method for transferring an article from one printing blanket
to a transfer conveyor with the features of claims 1 and 9
respectively.Th

<CLAIMS>
A printing system comprising a printing blanket (30), a transfer
conveyor (40) and an apparatus for transferring an article (20)

from the printing blanket (30) to the transfer conveyor (40),
said apparatus comprising:


an array of endless conveyorized strips (11) carried
by a roller (12) and a relatively rigid member (13);
moving means (14) operatively associated with the
roller (12) for effecting rotation of the roller (12) and

driving the strips (11);
the surface (15) of the strips being provided with
a series of upwardly extending projections (16), each

having a relatively small diameter in relation to its
length;

   characterized by 
disks (18) positioned longitudinally between the
strips (11) and coaxially with the roller (12) at

intervals across its width,
the disks diameter being sufficiently greater than that
of the roller (12) to extend above the projections

(16), so that the article (20) is lifted from the projections (16)
as it passes over the disks (18) and is carried to the

transfer conveyor.
The printing system set forth in claim 1 wherein at least one
blower (19b) is positioned across and forward of the

roller (12) for directing fluid generally toward the disks
(18).
The printing system set forth in the previous claims wherein
at least one blower (19a) is positioned across and forward

of the adjacent end of the printing blanket (30) for directing
fluid generally toward the strips (11
).
The printing system set forth in the previous claims, wherein
said at least one blower (19a, 19b), includes at least one

perforated hollow member.
The printing system set forth in the previous claims, wherein
the strips (11) comprise needle tape. 
The printing system set forth in the previous claims, wherein
the roller (12) and the rigid member (13) are positioned

within the strips (11).
The printing system set forth in the previous claims, wherein
the speed of the endless conveyorized strips is higher

than that of the printing blanket conveyor (30) and lower
than that of the transfer conveyor (40). 
The printing system set forth in the previous claims
wherein the screen printing method is used, further comprising

a dryer
and wherein means are provided for

sequentially controlling the speed of the printing
blanket, the strips, the transport conveyor, and the dryer

relative to one another so as to maintain an optimal speed
ratio between them. 
A method of transferring an article (20) from one
printing blanket (30) to

a transfer conveyor (40), which comprises the steps
of:


grabbing the article from the exit end (31) of the
printing blanket (30) using a series of upwardly extending projections

(16) arranged about the surface (15) of the endless
conveyorized strips, each projection being of a relatively

small diameter in relation to its length; and
transferring the lifted article to the transfer conveyor
and is characterized by the intermediate step of:
lifting the article from the projections by disks
(18) positioned longitudinally between the strips,

coaxially with a roller (12) driving the strips, and at
intervals across the roller width, the diameter of each

disk being greater than that of the roller to extend
above the projections (16), so that the article is lifted from the

projections (16) as it passes over the disks (18).
The method set forth in claim 9, wherein, while the
article (20) is lifted from the projections by disks (18),

a fluid is blown toward said disks to force said article
against them.
The method set forth in claims 9 and 10, wherein,
while the lifted article (20) is transferred to the transfer

conveyor, a fluid is blown toward said article for biasing
same toward the conveyor. 
The method set forth in claims 9-11, wherein the
strips comprise needle tape.
The method set forth in claims 9-12, wherein the
roller (12) and the rigid member (13) are positioned

within the strips (11).
The method set forth in claims 9-13, wherein the
endless strips (11) are moved at a speed higher than that

of the printing blanket (30) and lower than that
of the transfer conveyor (40).
