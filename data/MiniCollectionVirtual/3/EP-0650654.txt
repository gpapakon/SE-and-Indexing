<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a time switch and a method for implmenting time switching for signals of several different levels of hierarchy, said signals having a common frame structure which can be divided into blocks (41, 42) of different sizes, said blocks being switched differently from another. According to the method, the contents of the time slots of an incoming signal are written into a memory (61), from which they are read at the memory locations indicated by switching data contained in an address control memory (66). In order that the time switching could be implemented in a more simplified manner than before, the contents of all time slots of a frame are continuously written into one memory block (61) without synchronizing the writing with said frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to
the preamble of the accompanying claim 1 for implementing
time switching, and to a time switch according to
the preamble of the accompanying claim 3.In this connection, time switch refers to a
device capable of connecting the contents of any time
slot in the frame structure of an incoming signal to any
time slot in an outgoing frame structure. In addition
to a time switch, this device can also be called a time
slot interchanger.The problem involved in the switching of time
slots in a TDM (Time Division Multiplex) signal, comprising
frame blocks of different sizes (which will be
illustrated below), is how the storage capacity can be
efficiently utilized; in other words, how to minimize
the need for connection memory. This problem is
encountered for instance in the switching of an STM-1
signal in an SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)
network. In the following, the structure of this signal
will be described in greater detail.Figure 1 illustrates the structure of an STM-N
frame used in the SDH network, and Figure 2 illustrates
a single STM-1 frame. The STM-N frame comprises a matrix
with 9 rows and N x 270 columns so that there is one
byte at the junction point between each row and the
column. Rows 1-3 and rows 5-9 of the N x 9 first columns
comprise a section overhead SOH, and row 4 comprises an
AU pointer. The rest of the frame structure is formed
of a section having the length of N x 261 columns and
containing the payload section of the STM-N frame.Figure 2 illustrates a single STM-1 frame which
is 270 bytes in length, as described above. The payload
section comprises one or more administration units AU. 
In the example shown in the figure, the payload section
consists of the administration unit AU-4, into which a
virtual container VC-4 is inserted. (Alternatively, the
STM-1 transfer frame may contain three AU-3 units, each
containing a corresponding lower-level virtual container
VC-3). The VC-4 in turn consists of a path overhead POH
located at the beginning of each row and having the
length of one byte (9 bytes altogether), fixed stuff FS
located at the following two columns, TU-3 pointers or
a null pointer indicator NPI located at the following
three columns, fixed stuff or VC-3 path overheads (VC-3
POH) located at the following three columns, and the
actual payload section PL. The null pointer indicator
NPI is used to separate the tributary unit groups TUG-3
comprising TU-3 units from the tributary unit groups
TUG-3 comprising TU-2 units.Figure 3 shows

<CLAIMS>
A method for implementing time switching for
signals of several different levels of hierarchy, said

signals having a common frame structure which can be
divided into blocks (41, 42) of different sizes, said

blocks being switched differently from one another, in
which method the contents of the time slots of an

incoming signal are written into a memory (61), from
which they are read at the memory locations indicated by

switching data contained in an address control memory
(66), characterized in that information on the phase of

said frame is supplied to said address control memory
(66) by a phase identification circuit (67), the

contents of all time slots of a frame are continuously
written into memory locations of one memory block (61)

without synchronizing the writing with said frame, and
the write addresses (WA) of said memory locations are

supplied to a read unit (63) which controls reading out
of the contents of the time slots of the frame from the

memory locations using the write addresses and the
switching data.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the writing is controlled by a counter (62) which

is not in synchronization with the phase of the frame of
an incoming signal, said counter being

incremented/decremented by one in connection with each
writing event.
A time switch for implementing time switching

for signals of several different levels of hierarchy,
said signals having a common frame structure which can

be divided into blocks (41, 42) of different sizes, said
blocks being switched differently from one another, said

time switch comprising

a memory (61), into which the contents of
incoming time slots are written, 
first means (62), which control writing into the
memory (61), and
second means (63), which control reading from the
memory (61), and characterized by further comprising
phase identification means (67), which supplies
information on the phase of a frame of an incoming

signal to the second means (63), and wherein
said memory consists of one memory block (61), said

first means comprise a counter (62) which is not in
synchronization with the phase of the frame of an

incoming signal and which gives the write addresses (WA)
of the memory locations into which the contents of

incoming time slots are to be written, and in that said
counter (62) supplies the write addresses (WA) of the

memory locations into which the contents of incoming
time slots are written to said second means (63) to

enable the reading of the written contents of said time
slots from said memory locations.
A time switch according to claim 3,

characterized in that the memory block (61) is at least,
preferably exactly, twice as large as the largest frame

block.
