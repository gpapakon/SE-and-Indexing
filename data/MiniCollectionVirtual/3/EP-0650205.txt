<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a flexible oxide superconducting 
cable conductor which is reduced in ac loss, tape-shaped 

multifilamentary superconducting wires each comprising a 
plurality of filaments, consisting essentially of an oxide 

superconductor, covered with a stabilizing metal are 
spirally wound on a flexible former. The superconducting 

wires are preferably wound on the former at a bending 
strain of not more than 0.3 %. In winding on the former, 

a prescribed number of tape-shaped multifilamentary 
superconducting wires (11) are wound on a core member (10) 

in a side-by-side manner, to form a first layer. Then, an 
insulating layer (20) is provided on the first layer. 

This insulating layer (20) can be formed by an insulating 
tape. A prescribed number of tape-shaped superconducting 

multifilamentary wires (11') are wound on the insulating 
layer (20) in a side-by-side manner, to form a second 

layer. The insulating layer (20) is adapted to reduce ac 
loss of the conductor. When the former consists 

essentially of a metal, it is more preferable to provide 
an insulating layer between the former and the 

multifilamentary superconducting wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a superconducting cable conductor employing an oxide superconductor, and more
particularly, it relates to a flexible conductor which is applicable to a superconducting cable an an ac
superconducting cable conductor.An oxide superconductor which enters a superconducting state at the liquid nitrogen temperature is expected for
application to a superconducting cable with a cooling medium of liquid nitrogen. When such application is implemented,
it will be possible to simultaneously attain simplification of a thermal protection system and reduction of a cooling cost
in relation to a metal superconducting cable which requires high-priced liquid helium at present.A superconducting cable must be capable of transmitting a heavy current with low energy loss in a compact conductor.
Power transmission is generally made through an alternating current, and a superconductor employed under
an alternating current is inevitably accompanied by energy loss which is generically called ac loss. The ac loss such
as hysteresis loss, coupling loss or eddy current loss depends on the critical current density (Jc) of the superconductor,
sizes of filaments, the structure of the conductor, and the like.Various types of superconducting cables have heretofore been manufactured through metal superconductors, with
study of structures for reducing ac loss. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-36329 (1994) discloses a
superconducting conductor which comprises a normal conductor, and composite multifilamentary superconductors
which are spirally wound along the outer periphery of the normal conductor. The conductor disclosed in this gazette is
formed by clockwisely and anticlockwisely wound layers of the composite multifilamentary superconductors, which are
alternately superposed with each other. The directions for winding the conductors are varied every layer for reducing
magnetic fields generated in the conductors, thereby reducing impedance and increasing current carrying capacity
thereof. This gazette also proposes provision of a high-resistance or insulating layer between the layers, in order to
reduce ac loss.When a cable conductor is formed by an oxide superconductor, a technique employed in a metal superconductor
cannot be applied as such. An oxide superconductor, i.e., a ceramics superconductor, is fragile and weak against
mechanical strain as compared with a metal superconductor. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-36329
(1994) discloses a technique of spirally
