<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
cationic polymers having bioadhesive properties.
More specifically, this invention relates to the use
of certain cationic polysaccharide polymers in compositions
adapted for the delivery of an anionic therapeutic agent to the eye.The delivery of therapeutic substances to
mucosal surfaces has inherent difficulties due to
the moist surface. This is particularly true for
the mucosal surface of the eye where the washing
action of the tear film removes much of the
therapeutic substance. Estimates of the portion of
a drug delivered by means of a topical drop range
from 1 to 10% of the drug content. The remaining
portion of the drug which does not penetrate or
adhere to the eye is removed by tears through the
lacrimal ducts where systemic absorption occurs
through contact with nasal and gastro-intestinal
surfaces.A common ophthalmic problem, particularly
with older people, is the condition commonly known
as "dry eye" or dyslacrima. As people age, the tear
ducts in the eye produce less moisture.
Consequently, the eye becomes dry, inflamed and
irritated.Prior developments in the treatment of dry
eye condition are described in DE-A-3440352
and US-A-3,947,573. The DE-A discloses two
formulations useful in treating dry eye. The first
formulation is a dry-eye solution comprising an
isotonicized, water-soluble cationic cellulose
derivative, and optional viscosity-enhancing
additives. The second formulation comprises an
acrylate-based aqueous gel containing carboxyvinyl
polymers.Despite the teachings of the prior art,
there is a continuing need for a composition for treating
the eye in order to retain an active agent for a
longer period of time.This invention pertains to topical
substantive delivery systems for the eye
comprising a clear aqueous solution of a cationic
polysaccharide and an anionic therapeutic active
ingredient. The present invention is particularly
well suited to deliver anionic therapeutic agents,
such as hyaluronic acid or its salt, to the surface
of the eye.More specifically, the present invention provides a
composition in the form of a clear solution which is adapted for
the delivery of an anionic therapeutic agent to the eye, comprising:
(a) water;(b) a cationic polysaccharide polymer which is substantive to the eye
and comprises a quaternary-nitrogen radical with N-substituents selected from
alkyl and alkoxyalkyl radicals each containing up to 4 carbon atoms, said
quaternary-nitrogen radical being substituted on said polysaccharide at a degree
of

<CLAIMS>
A composition in the form of a clear solution which is adapted for the
delivery of an anionic therapeutic agent to the eye, comprising:


(a) water;
(b) a cationic polysaccharide polymer which is substantive to the eye and
comprises a quaternary-nitrogen radical with N-substituents selected from alkyl and

alkoxyalkyl radicals each containing up to 4 carbon atoms, said quaternary-nitrogen
radical being substituted on said polysaccharide at a degree of cationic substitution

of greater than 0.2;
(c) said anionic therapeutic agent; and
(d) salt, boric acid or a sugar in an amount effective to provide a clear
solution;

wherein the relative weight ratio of component (b) to component (c) ranges
from 0.01:1 to 50:1.
The composition of Claim 1 wherein the cationic polysaccharide
polymer is a cationic cellulosic.
The composition of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the anionic therapeutic
agent is glycosoaminoglycan.
The composition of Claim 3 wherein the anionic therapeutic agent
is selected from hyaluronan, hyaluronic acid and other hyaluronan derivatives. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1-3, wherein the anionic therapeutic
agent is selected from anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-infection, glaucoma

agents, wound healing agents, diagnostic agents, dry eye agents, and mixtures
thereof. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 - 5 wherein the anionic
therapeutic agent is covalently bonded to the cationic polysaccharide.
The composition of any one of Claims 1 - 5 wherein component (d)
is present as an isotonic solution. 
The composition of any one of Claims 1 - 7 wherein said cationic
polysaccharide polymer is a water-soluble cationic derivative of cellulose ether

which is substantive to the eye mucosal surface.
