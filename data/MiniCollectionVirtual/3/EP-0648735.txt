<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for the preparation of  gamma -acetoxytiglinaldehyde, which is known as an important starting material for the preparation of vitamin A acetate from a ( beta -ionylideneethyl)triphenylphosphonium halide and this aldehyde, consists in subjecting a pentenyn-3-ol of the formula HC IDENTICAL C-C(CH3)(OH)-CH=C(R)2 (II) wherein both Rs are either hydrogen or methyl to a selective ozonolysis in a lower alkanol R
<

OH wherein R
<

 is C1-4-alkyl, hydrogenating the 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-butynal thus obtained of the formula HC IDENTICAL C-C(CH3)(OH)-CHO (III) and 1-alkoxyalkyl hydroperoxide of the formula (HOO)(R

 (IV) possibly obtained as a by-product to the known 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-butenal of the formula H2C=CH-C(CH3)(OH)-CHO (V) catalytically and (for III) selectively, and converting this in a manner known per se to the  gamma -acetoxytiglinaldehyde of the formula CH3COO-CH2CH=C(CH3)-CHO (I). The conversion of the butenal V to the aldehyde I can expediently be carried out by the known process steps acetalisation, acetylation, catalysed rearrangement and acid-catalysed hydrolysis.
