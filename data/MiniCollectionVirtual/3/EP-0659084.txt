<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns medical preparations 
for internal use, or for another use, containing 
poly-N-methylated monocyclic undecapeptides called 
cyclosporins. This group of stucturally similar peptides called 
cyclosporins is produced by some deuteromycetes, such as 
e. g. Tolypocladium inflatum (Swiss pat. 589 716 and 
603 790) or Tolypocladium terricola (Mat'ha V. at al., 
Cytobios 69, 163 - 170, 1992). Besides cyclosporin 
A (=ciclosporin) of formula I a number of structurally 
similar natural cyclosporins was isolated (Traber et 
al., Helv. Chim. Acta 65, 1655 - 1667, 1982). Modified 
cyclosporins which were prepared by partial synthesis 
were described also in EPA 0216 122 or in Czechoslovak 
patent 277 472. 
Especially immunosuppressive properties of 
systemically administered ciclosporin are used in 
therapy or during organ transplants or bone marrow 
transplants. It is also applicable in treatment of broad 
range of autoimmune diseases of inflammatory etiology 
and also as antiparasitic treatment. Ciclosporin is used 
e. g. in rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid polyarthritis), 
hematologic diseases (aplastic anemia, idiopathic 
thrombocytopenia), gastric disorders (ulcerating 
colitis, Crohn disease), dermatic diseases (psoriasis, 
sclerodermia) and eye diseases (uveitis). Also topical 
applications have been tested e. g. in treatment of 
psoriasis, uveitis and allopecia. Bioavailability of ciclosporin varies between 
20 - 50 % for currently available dosage formulations 
(Wood A. J., et al., Transplant Proc., 15, suppl. 2409, 
1983). There are significant differences between groups 
of patients. E. g. there is a low bioavailability in 
liver acceptors, and increased bioavailability in bone 
marrow transplantation. The interpersonal variability of 
biovailability is considerably greater, ranging from a 
few percent to 90 %. This is complicated also by the 
presence of significant variations in the course of the 
treatment. Effective immunosuppressive treatment requires 
keeping a certain level of ciclosporin in blood and 
maintaining this level in certain range. The range 
required is always specific depending upon therapeutic 
goal. E. g. in cases of graft rejection or in treatment 
of autoimmune disease, it is necessary to take into 
account application of another immunosuppressant at the 
same time. When formulating medical drugs with 
cyclosporins, it is important to take into account their 
high lipophilicity. Solubility of these drugs in water  
 
varies usually from 1.6 - 2.3 mg/100
