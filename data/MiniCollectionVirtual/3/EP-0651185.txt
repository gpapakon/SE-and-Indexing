<ABSTRACT>
A transmission includes a plurality of shift rails 
20, 21, 22, each of which is axially movable forwardly 

and rearwardly from a center neutral position to 
respective gear engaging positions. The lower shift 

rails 20, 21 are provided for manual shifting among the 
lower gear ratios of the transmission. The highest 

shift rail 22 is provided for selective manual or 
automatic shifting among the highest two gear ratios of 

the transmission. An idler rail 30 is disposed 
adjacent to the highest shift rail 22. For manual 

shifting, the idler rail 30 is connected to the highest 
shift rail 22, and a manually operable shift lever 14 

is used to move both the idler rail 30 and the highest 
shift rail 22. For automatic shifting, the idler rail 

30 is disconnected from the highest shift rail 22, and 
an automatic shift member 32 is moved into cooperation 

with the highest shift rail 22. Rotation of the 
automatic shift shaft 31 causes corresponding movement 

of the automatic shift member 32. An electronic 
controller 121 is provided for controlling the 

automatic shifting of the transmission in response to 
sensed operating conditions of the vehicle. A circuit 

is provided for sensing the rotational position of the 
automatic shift shaft 31 and for generating an 

electrical signal which is representative of the actual 
position thereof, which is also representative of the 

actual position of the highest shift rail 22, to the 
electronic controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to vehicle 
transmissions and in particular to an improved transmission 
structure wherein the lower gear ratios are shifted 
manually and wherein the higher gear ratios can be shifted 
either manually or automatically as desired. In most vehicles, a transmission is provided in the 
drive train between the engine and the driven wheels. As 
is well known, the transmission includes a case containing 
an input shaft, an output shaft, and a plurality of meshing 
gears. Means are provided for connecting selected ones of 
the meshing gears between the input shaft and the output 
shaft to provide a desired speed reduction gear ratio 
therebetween. The meshing gears contained within the 
transmission case are of varying size so as to provide a 
plurality of such gear ratios. By appropriate selection of 
these gear ratios, acceleration and deceleration of the 
vehicle can be accomplished in a smooth and efficient 
manner. Many transmission structures are known in the art for 
performing this gear ratio selection manually, i.e., in 
response to some physical exertion by the vehicle driver. 
In a conventional manual transmission, the driver grasps 
and moves an upper portion of a pivotable shift lever. In 
response thereto, a lower portion of the shift lever is 
moved into selective engagement with one of a plurality of 
shift rails provided within the transmission. Thus, 
movement of the shift lever causes movement of the selected 
one of the shift rails. Movement of the selected shift 
rail causes certain ones of the meshing gears to be  
 
connected between the input shaft and the output shaft so 
as to provide the desired gear ratio therebetween. Many transmission structures are also known in the art 
for performing this gear ratio selection manually, i.e., 
without any physical exertion by the vehicle driver. In a 
conventional automatic transmission, the shift rails are 
typically replaced by a plurality of hydraulically or 
pneumatically actuated structures. In response to 
predetermined operating conditions, these structures cause 
certain ones of the meshing gears to be connected between 
the input shaft and the output shaft so as to provide the 
desired gear ratio therebetween. Although automatic 
transmissions offer the advantages of increased convenience 
of use and reduced fatigue for the driver, manual 
transmissions provide the advantages of decreased cost, 
increased torque capacity, and better fuel economy. 
Because of this, the majority of medium and heavy duty

A transmission comprising: 
   an input shaft; 

   an output shaft; 
   a gear engaging mechanism selectively operable in 

a first condition, wherein said input shaft is not 
connected to said output shaft, and a second condition, 

wherein said input shaft is connected through said gear 
engaging mechanism to said output shaft; 

   a shift rail movable between a first shift rail 
position, wherein said gear engaging mechanism is 

operated in said first condition, and a second shift 
rail position, wherein said gear engaging mechanism is 

operated in said second condition;
