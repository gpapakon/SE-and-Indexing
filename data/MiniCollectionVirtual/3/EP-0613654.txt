<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises an optical catheter (13) and a sterile 
calibration reference device (10) having means (16,17) to hold the catheter 

(13) in a slot (51) with an end portion (13C) received through an opening 
(26) in a cavity (23) forming part of a calibration element (15). The 

catheter is radially removable from the slot (51) and a protective shield 
(21) is provided to shield a balloon portion (13B) of the catheter. The 

shield has a flared portion (27,29) and extends from the opening (26) 
towards the end portion (13C) of the catheter and is flared outwardly from 

the cavity axis towards the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
Technical Field. This invention relates generally to 
optical catheter calibration, and more particularly to a 
catheter calibration device featuring a new and improved 
retainer arrangement for retaining the catheter in 
proximity with the calibration element. Background Information. Calibration of an optical 
catheter, which may or may not also include calibration of 
the associated instrumentation, is often accomplished with 
a calibration element of known optical properties placed 
over the end portion of the catheter tube. Light 
propagated through the catheter tube returns from the 
calibration element to suitable instrumentation, with the 
measurements taken providing an optical characterization 
of the catheter and instrumentation. This 
characterization is then used to quantify subsequent 
measurements taken of a sample under examination. In calibrating the catheter, it is important that the 
end portion of the catheter tube be retained in a 
preferred proximity with the calibration element, and that 
this be done in a sterile environment while enabling a 
convenient, repeatable calibration prior to catheter use. 
However, existing devices intended to accomplish this have 
certain drawbacks that need to be overcome. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,322,164 to Shaw et al. 
describes a box that is sealed with the catheter in a  
 
dual-envelope sterilizable package so that the end portion of the catheter 
is located loosely in the box. In order to calibrate the catheter, the box 
is actuated by pressing a trigger mechanism through the package wrapper, 
and this causes a resilient holder to grip the catheter tube as a spring 
drives a calibration element in the form of a reflective calibrant material 
against the catheter tip. Thus, the end portion of the catheter is placed and retained against 
the calibration element for calibration purposes, but only with a relatively 
complicated and expensive mechanical device. Therefore, it is desirable 
to have a new and improved arrangement for doing this--a calibration 
device that is less complicated and less expensive that achieves the desired 
function of catheter tube retention proximate the calibration element in a 
sterile environment enabling convenient, repeatable catheter calibration. 
EP-A-0271304 discloses a calibration boot for an optical catheter, the boot 
comprising a cavity into which a length of the distal end of the catheter is 
axially inserted in order to position the end of the catheter in contact with 
a calibration surface. The
