<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of genetic disease diagnosis, tumor
detection and treatment, and genetic therapy. Specifically, the invention is
directed to the merlin gene, merlin protein, and the use of the gene and/or
protein for (1) detecting a predisposition to develop tumors especially
neurofibromatosis-2, (2) diagnosing certain tumors, especially
neurofibromatosis-2, (3) treating tumors. especially neurofibromatosis-2,
(4) monitoring the course of tumor treatment, especially neurofibromatosis-2
treatment, and (5) gene replacement in affected non-tumor tissues or cells.Neurofibromatosis (NF) describes two major human genetic disorders
that display autosomal dominant inheritance. involve tumors of the nervous
system, and which are distinct clinical entities (Mulvihill. J.J. et al., Ann.Intern. Med. 113:39-52 (1990)). NF1, or von Recklinghausen NF, is more
common (incidence of 1/4,000) and is characterized by the highly variable
expression of an array of features that include neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait
macules, Lisch nodules of the iris, and a predisposition to certain malignant
tumors (Riccardi, V.M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 305:1617-1627 (1981);
Riccardi, V.M. et al., "Neurofibromatosis: Phenotype, Natural History, and
Pathogenesis," Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, Baltimore, MD (1986)). It is
caused by defects in a gene on chromosome 17 that has recently been isolated
and characterized (Viskochil, D. et al., Cell 62:187-192 (1990); Cawthon,
R.M. et al., Cell 62:193-201 (1990); Wallace, M.R. et al., Science 249:183-186
(1990)). The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, is a large protein with
a GAP-related domain and is presumably involved in modulating a signal
transduction pathway whose disruption can lead to tumor formation (Ballester,
R. et al., Cell 63:851-859 (1990); Buchberg, A.M. et al., Nature 347:291-294
(1990); Xu, G. et al., Cell 62:599-608 (1990); DeClue, J.E. et al., Cell
69:265-273 (1992); Basu, T.N. et al., Nature 356:713-715 (1992)).In contrast, neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2), which occurs in about 1/40,000
livebirths (Evans, D.G.R. et al., J. Med. Genet. 29:841-846 (1992)), is
characterized by bilateral schwannomas that develop on the vestibular branch
of the 8th cranial nerve. Pressure from these tumors often causes hearing loss
and vestibular symptoms in the second and third decade. Other tumors of the
brain, especially meningiomas and schwannomas of other cranial nerves and
spinal nerve roots (Martuza, R.L. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 318:684-688
(1988)), and posterior capsular lens opacities
