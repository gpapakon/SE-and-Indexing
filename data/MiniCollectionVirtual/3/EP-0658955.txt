<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a planar filter (1) for multipole plug connectors (10) having a carrier which has an opening for each signal line and, in the region of this opening, a capacitor with a first foil (2.3) which is connected to the associated signal line and having a second foil (2.1) which is connected via the conductive housing to earth, as well as a dielectric (2.2) between the two foils, such that, with the signal lines lying closely adjacent, sufficient capacitances are provided for the capacitors and the planar filter (1) can be used without any solder joint, it is proposed that a contact insert (5) having at least two contact fingers (7) be soldered into each opening in order to hold the connecting pins (11.1) and be electrically connected to a first foil (2.3), which extends into the opening, of the associated capacitor, such that the connecting pins (11.1) are constructed electrically with the first foil (2.3), which is assigned to the respective signal electrode, and two mutually opposite edges of the planar filter (1), as conductive side regions (3) which are connected to the earth electrode (2.1) of said planar filter (1), and can be connected via the metallic housing (15) of the plug connector (10) to earth.

Planar filter for connectors having a multiplicity of signal
lines to be connected, which are arranged in rows and columns,

with a carrier including for each of these signal lines an
opening and in the area of this opening a capacitor with a first

coating connected with the associated signal line, a second
coating connected to ground via the conducting housing, as well

as a layer-like dielectric between the first and second coatings,
wherein a contact insert (5) having at least two contact fingers

(7) for holding the connecting pins (11.1) is soldered into each
of the openings of the planar filter (1) and is electrically

connected with a first coating of the associated capacitor, which
extends into the opening, the connecting pins (11.1) being

adapted to be electrically connected via the contact fingers (7)
to the first coating of the capacitors, which is associated with

the respective signal electrode, and in that two edges of the
planar filter, which are arranged opposite to each other, are

formed as conducting lateral areas (3) connected to the ground
electrodes thereof and are adapted to be connected to ground via

the metallic housing (15) of the connector (10), characterized in
that the first coatings of the capacitors, which are associated

with the signal electrodes, are formed as dumbbell-shaped dual
structures having a preferential axis and are arranged such that

the preferential axes of the dual structures of the coatings of
adjacent capacitors run crosswise, the linking arms of both part-structures

centrally accomodating the lead-through opening for
the connecting pins and being connected with the metallized

portions contained in these lead-through openings.

Planar filter as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, fixed on a
metallic ground contact plate (4), characterized in that the

planar filter (1) is conductively connected with the metallic
ground contact plate (4) having openings corresponding to the

opening for passing through the connecting pins (11.1) of the
planar filter (1) and having a diameter which, for preventing any

shorts between the connecting pins (11.1) and ground, is greater
than that of the lead-through openings, and which at least on one

of the sides of the planar filter (1), preferably on two sides
lying opposite each other, are provided with a strip-like

protrusion (4.1), for connection with the contacts to be 
connected to ground, particularly of the metallized lateral areas

of the planar filter (1) with general ground, the ground
connection being preferably via the connector.
Planar filter as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that
the protruding edge strip(s) (4.1) has/have openings for passing

fastening fingers of the metal sheets of lateral shields
therethrough.
Connector having a planar filter as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, particularly intended for being mounted on

printed circuit boards, including a plastic base plate provided
with lateral metal shielding sheets provided with contact lugs,

and provided with openings for passing connecting pins carrying
the signals as well as the contact lugs of the metal shielding

sheets for the connection thereof to general ground, with lateral
guiding fingers being integrally moulded to the base plate, which

extend at right angles relative thereto, said guiding fingers
engaging in the counter-plug and guiding it in such a way that

the connecting pins mate with the sockets and allow their being
inserted thereinto, and being arranged with cut-outs in intervals

in such a way that at least between some of the portions
transverse shields may be inserted, characterized in that the

side of the base plate (12), which faces the printed circuit
board (11), includes a recess (14) accomodating the planar filter

means placed underneath, in order to compensate for protruding
portions of the signal pins with a greater diameter.
