<ABSTRACT>
A portable electric tool has a housing (15), an electric 
motor (22) energized by a trigger-operated switch (10), and a 

receptable (18) recessed in the housing (15). Terminals of the 
switch (10) are formed as plug prongs (13) which extend 

outwardly directly from the switch housing (12) into the 
receptable (18) for receiving the female connector (16) of a 

power supply cable (17). Preferably, a second set of plug 
prongs (14) extend forwardly from the switch housing (12) 

and receive a female connector (19) of a motor cable (20). 
This arrangement enables wiring connections to the switch 

for the supply cable to be eliminated.
