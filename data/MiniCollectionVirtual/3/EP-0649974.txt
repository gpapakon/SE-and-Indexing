<ABSTRACT>
A follow up mechanism (10) for maintaining a 
timed positional relationship between a bearing cage 

(35,36) of an arcuate roller bearing assembly (24,26) 
and a swashplate (19) supported by the bearing 

assembly (24,26) includes a flexural elastic link (41) 
pivotally connected to the bearing cage (35,36) and 

having first and second ends (42,43) slidably disposed 
within a first bore (48,49) in a pump housing (14) and 

a second bore (51,52) in the swashplate (19), 
respectively. The bores (48,51;49,52) are in axial 

alignment with each other when the swashplate (19) is 
in the equivalent of its centered position thereby 

allowing blind assembly of the follow up mechanism 
(10) thereby eliminating the need for an access 

opening in the side of the pump housing (14) and the 
associated cover, gasket and bolts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a
hydraulic axial cylinder device and more particularly
to a follow up mechanism for timing the bearing cage
of a roller bearing supporting a tiltable swashplate
of such devices.Axial piston variable displacement hydraulic
units utilize a tiltable swashplate to control the
displacement of pistons within a rotating cylinder
block. One common type of tiltable swashplate is a
cradle-type swashplate which is supported at one end
of the housing by a pair of arcuate bearings having
rolling elements. Each of the pair of roller bearings
is provided with a bearing cage locating the
individual rollers of the bearing. Roller bearing
geometries require the arcuate displacement of the
bearing cage be in direct proportion to the arcuate
displacement of the cradle swashplate in order to
obtain an exclusively rolling motion of the roller
elements. Furthermore, since the roller bearings are
arcuate but not totally circular, repeated tilting of
the swashplate can lead to slipping of the roller
elements between the housing and the cradle swashplate
to positions other than the desired optimum support
positions for resisting the axial thrust of the
swashplate.In order to assure that the arcuate roller
bearings do not slip to an adverse position, some of
the axial piston hydraulic units have a timing or
locating arrangement in the form of elongate rods or 
links extending between the swashplate and the housing
and being connected to the cage of the cradle bearing.One of the problems encountered with those
link-type locating means is that the links either have
transversely extending projections extending into
mating bores in the swashplate and housing or have
openings that slide onto pivot pins extending
transversely from the swashplate and the housing. In
both cases, the links are installed after the
swashplate is installed thereby requiring an access
opening provided in the side of the housing. The
opening then must be covered by a removable cover with
some type of seal or gasket between the housing and
the cover. Providing the access opening, the cover
and the seal adds to the cost of the unit. Moreover,
the access opening provides a potential leakage path
from the interior of the unit housing.Attention is drawn to FR-A-2 353 747 and DE-A-2 521 321, both
of which disclose axial piston variable displacement hydraulic
units having a housing, a swashplate together with a pivotal
connection between a timing link and a bearing cage.In view of the above, it would be desirable
to have a simple
