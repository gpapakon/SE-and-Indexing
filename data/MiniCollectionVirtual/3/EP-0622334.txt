<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for making fumed 
silica aggregate having an average convex perimeter in 

the range of about 0.12 micron to about 0.6 micron 
based on the combustion of a mixture of a silicon 

compound, such as an organosilane, an oxygen 
containing gas, such as air and a fuel such as 

hydrogen. The fumed silica aggregate has been found 
to enhance properties in heat curable filled silicone 

compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
for making fumed silica and product obtained 
therefrom. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to burning a mixture of a fuel, such as 
hydrogen, a silicon compound, such as a silane or an 
organosilane, and oxygen or an oxygen containing gas 
in a combustion chamber to produce aggregates having 
an average convex perimeter in the range of about 0.12 
micron to about 0.60 micron. Prior to the present invention, various 
procedures were used to prepare finely divided silicon 
dioxide by burning a mixture of an organohalosilane, 
hydrogen and an oxygen containing mixture. Some of 
these methods are shown by Lange et al , U.S. patent 
3,954,945, Lee, U.S. patent 4,048,290 and Kratel et 
al, U.S. patent 4,108,964. Existing methods for making finely divided 
metal oxides, such as hydrophilic silicon dioxide are 
generally based on a procedure involving feeding a 
combustible mixture of a metal or metalloid halide, 
hydrogen, and an oxygen-containing gas such as air, to 
a burner in a combustion chamber, which results in the  
 
production of primary metal oxide particles, such as 
particles of silicon dioxide. The primary metal oxide 
particles form aggregates having an average convex 
perimeter of about 0.5 micron to 1.5 microns which can 
often exceed the optimum average aggregate size 
desired in particular applications. The term "convex 
perimeter" is defined hereinafter as the average 
circumferential distance from high point to high point 
around the aggregate measured from TEM micrographs. A method for reducing aggregate size is 
shown by Kratel et al, U.S. patent 3,953,487. The 
Kratel et al process involves reducing aggregate size 
by subjecting hydrophobic silicon dioxide aggregates 
composed of interlaced chains of primary SiO2 
particles to a mechanical impact treatment. Size 
reduction is used in combination with water and in 
further combination with an organosilicon compound, 
such as hexamethyldisilazane. The reduced hydrophobic 
silicon dioxide aggregates have been found to have a 
smaller average convex perimeter. It would be 
desirable to provide alternate methods for directly 
making fumed silicon dioxide aggregates which did not 
require an additional milling step. The present invention is based on the 
discovery that fumed silica aggregate having a surface 
area in the range of from 75-500 m2/g and an average 
convex perimeter in the range of between about 0.12 
micron to 0.60 micron can be made directly without 
resort to
