<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multilayered water-repellent film 
formed on a glass substrate by the sol-gel process. The film has a 

first metal oxide layer which is formed on the glass substrate by 
the sol-gel process and a second water-repellent layer formed on 

the first layer. As a first method for providing the film with 
superior durability of water repellency, mechanical strength and 

chemical resistance, the first layer is prepared by using a mixture 
of three specific sols which are respectively prepared from metal 

alkoxides or metal acetylacetonates. As a second method for 
providing the film with the above advantages, the second layer is 

prepared by using a coating mixture comprising a 
fluoroalkylsilane, tin oxide particles doped with antimony oxide, a 

silicon compound, water and an organic solvent. As a third 
method for providing the film with the above advantages, the 

second layer is prepared by using another coating mixture 
comprising a fluoroalkylsilane, tin oxide particles doped with 

antimony oxide, a silicon compound, water, an organic solvent 
and an acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayered water-repellent
film, and a method of forming the film on a glass
substrate. The film-forming method belongs to the sol-gel
process. The water-repellent coating is suitable for application,
for example, to vehicular and architectural window glasses which
are to be exposed to rain water.Hitherto, there have been various proposals to provide a
glass substrate with water repellency. For example, there have
been proposed water-repellent agents to be applied to a glass
substrate surface, each of which contains a silane compound
having a polyfluoroalkyl group or a condensate of the partially
hydrolyzed silane compound (see JP-A-58-122979, JP-A-58-142958,
JP-A-58-147483, JP-A-58-172242, JP-A-58- 172243, JP-A-58-172245,
JP-A-58-172246, JP-A-58-190840 and JP-A-58-223634).
JP-A-58-167448 discloses a reflectance reducing agent
which contains a silane compound having a polyfluoroalkyl group
or a condensate of the partially hydrolyzed silane compound.JP-A-58-129082 and JP-A-58-172244 disclose, as water-repellent
agents, silicone block oligomers each having a
polyfluoroalkyl group.JP-A-5-345641 discloses a method of forming a water-repellent
film on a glass substrate. This method comprises the
steps of: (a) applying a mixture to the glass substrate and (b)
baking the coated glass substrate in an atmosphere containing
fluoroalkylsilane vapor so as to increase the fluoroalkyl content
of the water-repellent film. This mixture contains a metal
alkoxide, a substituted metal alkoxide in which alkoxyl groups
are partially replaced with fluoroalkyl groups, an alcohol, water,
and an acid or a base.JP-3-90345 discloses a high refractive index dielectric layer
formed on a transparent substrate and a low refractive index
layer formed on the dielectric layer. This dielectric layer contains 
inorganic fine particles which may be tin oxide doped with
antimony. The low refractive index layer is prepared from a
mixture containing a fluoroalkyl-containing compound, a silicon
compound, an alcohol and an acid.However, the above publications' proposals do not provide
glass substrates with water-repellent and/or reflectance reducing
films which are superior in durability and weatherability tests.There is a glass substrate coated with a film of Teflon (a
trade name). However, this film is soft and thus tends to have
scratches thereon. With this, the film becomes opaque.JP-A-5-51238 discloses a water-repellent film formed on a
glass substrate. This film (2) has a metal oxide phase (21) and
wate
