Plant 
characterized in that
 it carries in its genome one or more
genes expressing one or more enzymes of the initial steps of the phytosterol

biosynthesis pathway comprising the chain of biochemical reactions
whereby mevalonic acid is converted into farnesyl diphosphate, said genes

being either not found in the native plant, or originating from said plant, in

which case they are present in a number of copies greater than that of the
native plant or are modified in their structure or their function compared

with those of the native plant.
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said initial step
is the conversion of mevalonic acid into mevalonyl 5-phosphate.
Plant according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 it
carries one or more genes coding for one or more mevalonate kinases.
Plant according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the mevalonate
kinase is encoded by the gene ERG12, or one of its derivatives or fragments

expressing a mevalonate kinase activity.
Plant according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 it carries one or more genes coding for the mevalonate kinase activity
in cruciferous plants, and in particular in Arabidopsis or rapeseed.
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it carries one
or more genes coding for a farnesyl diphosphate synthetase.
Plant according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the farnesyl
diphosphate synthetase is encoded by the yeast gene ERG20, or one of its

derivatives or fragments expressing a farnesyl diphosphate synthetase
activity.
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it carries one
or more genes coding for an AMVP kinase.
Plant according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the AMVP
kinase is encoded by the gene ERG8, or one of its derivatives or fragments

expressing an AMVP kinase activity.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 it
belongs to the category of oleoproteinaceous plants. 
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 it
belongs to the cruciferous plant family and in particular is a member of the

rapeseed species.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 it
is a member of the sunflower species.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 it
is a member of the Vigna radiata or egg-plant species.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 it
belongs to the Fabaceae family and in particular is a member of the soya

species.
Plant according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that

the gene or genes are placed under the control of a promoter inserted close
to the gene or genes in such a way as to allow the expression of their

biologically active products.
Vector for the insertion of at least one gene coding for one or
more enzymes of the initial steps of the phytosterol biosynthesis pathway

comprising the chain of biochemical reactions whereby mevalonic acid is
converted into farnesyl diphosphate in plant cells, 
characterized in that
 it
comprises:


a gene sequence to be inserted,
one or more promoter sequences upstream of the gene to be
inserted,
one or more terminator sequences downstream of the gene to be
inserted,
one or more markers allowing the selection of the cells in which
the gene is inserted, and
sequences of a Ti plasmid allowing the transfer of said genes and
markers from a bacterium to a plant cell, said genes and markers

being oriented and inserted so as to allow their expression.
Vector according to claim 16, 
characterized in that
 the gene
codes for a mevalonate kinase.
Vector according to claim 17, 
characterized in that
 the gene is
the ERG12 gene.
Plasmid pFAB2 according to claim 18, 
characterized in that
 it
has been deposited under the name I-1176 on 14th February 1992 in the 

Collection Nationale de Culture des Micro-organismes of the Institut
Pasteur (CNCM).
Method for processing a plant by insertion into its genome of a
gene coding for one or more enzymes of the initial steps of the phytosterol

biosynthesis pathway comprising the chain of biochemical reactions
whereby mevalonic acid is converted into farnesyl diphosphate.
Method according to claim 20, 
characterized in that
 the
insertion is performed by transfer into individual cells or groups of cells of

a vector according to one of claims 16 to 19, optionally in the presence of
another vector of the plasmid Ti type having functions allowing this

transfer.
