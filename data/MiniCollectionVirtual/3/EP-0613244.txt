<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device with high linearity of limitation of a characteristic of a signal at a threshold value Smax, and especially of the amplitude of a radar signal in a high-linearity receiving system. The device according to the invention consists of a limiter (23), the limiting threshold Slim of which is switchable to two possible values Sh and Sb chosen respectively to be higher and lower than Smax, and of means (21, 22) controlling the switching of the limiting threshold Slim to one or the other of the preceding values according to whether a measurement representative of a characteristic of the signal, such as the amplitude, delivered by measurement means (20) is greater than or less than a defined comparison threshold VH. Such a device is of great benefit in a highly linear radar receiving system performing analog-digital coding of the radar signal, since it protects the coder used from saturation with minimum degradation of the dynamic range and linearity performance.
