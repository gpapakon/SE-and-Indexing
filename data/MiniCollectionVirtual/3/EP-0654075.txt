<ABSTRACT>
Four novel (Bacillus thuringiensis) strains, which are deposited at the BCCM-LMG under accession nos. LMG P-12592, LMG P-12593, LMG P-12594, and LMG P-13493, produce new crystal proteins during sporulation that are toxic to Lepidoptera, more particularly against Noctuidae such as (Spodoptera) spp. and (Agrotis ipsilon), against Pyralidae such as (Ostrinia nubilalis), and against Yponomeutidae such as (Plutella xylostella), and that are encoded by a novel gene. The crystal proteins contain protoxins, which can yield a toxin as trypsin-digestion product. A plant, the genome of which is transformed with a DNA sequence that comes from either one of the strains and that encodes its respective toxin, is resistant to Lepidoptera. Each strain, itself, or its crystals, crystal proteins, protoxin or toxin can be used as the active ingredient in an insecticidal composition for combatting Lepidoptera.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to four novel strains of Bacillus
thuringiensis (the "BTS02617A strain", the "BTS02618A strain",
the "BTS02654B strain" and the "BTS02652E strain"), each of
which produces crystallized proteins (the "BTS02617A crystal
proteins", the "BTS02618A crystal proteins", the "BTS02654B
crystal proteins" and the "BTS02652E crystal proteins",
respectively) which are packaged in crystals (the "BTS02617A
crystals", the "BTS02618A crystals", the "BTS02654B crystals"
and the "BTS02652E crystals", respectively) during sporulation.
The BTS02617A, BTS02618A, BTS02654B and BTS02652E strains were
deposited under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty at the
Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms - Collection
Laboratorium voor Microbiologie Belgium ("BCCM-LMG"), R.U.G.,
K. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent.This invention also relates to an insecticide composition
that is active against Lepidoptera and that comprises the
BTS02617A, BTS02618A, BTS02654B or BTS02652E strain, as such,
or preferably the BTS02617A, BTS02618A, BTS02654B or BTS02652E
crystals, crystal proteins or the active component(s) thereof
as an active ingredient.This invention further relates to a gene (the "bTS02618A
gene"), which is present in the genome of the BTS02617A,
BTS02618A, BTS02654B and BTS02652E strains and which encodes
an insecticidal protein (the "BTS02618A protoxin") that is
found in the BTS02617A, BTS02618A, BTS02654B and BTS02652E
crystals. The BTS02618A protoxin is the protein that is
produced by the BTS02617A, BTS02618A, BTS02654B and BTS02652E
strains before being packaged into their respective BTS02617A,
BTS02618A, BTS02654B and BTS02652E crystals.This invention still further relates to a toxin (the
"BTS02618A toxin") which can be obtained (e.g., by trypsin
digestion) from the BTS02618A protoxin. The BTS02618A toxin
is an insecticidally active protein which can be liberated from 
the BTS02617A crystals, the BTS02618A crystals, the BTS02654B
crystals, and the BTS02652E crystals, which are produced by the
BTS02617A strain, the BTS02618A strain, the BTS02654B strain
and the BTS02652E strain, respectively. This toxin and its
protoxin have a high activity against a wide range of
lepidopteran insects, particularly against Noctuidae,
especially against Spodoptera and Agrotis spp., but also
against other important lepidopteran insects such as Pyralidae,
particularly the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and
Yponomeutidae such as Plutella xylostella. This new
characteristic of the BTS02618A protoxin and
