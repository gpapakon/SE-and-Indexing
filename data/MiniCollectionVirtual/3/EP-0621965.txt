Method for the operation of a direct digital 
synthesiser (1) which contains one or several channels 

(A, B, ...) each with a phase increment register and 
can be controlled by a computer in that the computer 

(2) transmits information bits to the DDS (1), 
characterised in that each of the phase increment 

registers comprises a bit width n and in operation at 
each point in time a stored phase value P with the bit 

length n, and that the addition of a phase increment 
Q with the bit length n takes place according to the 

following rule: 

 
and that the subtraction of a phase increment Q with 

the bit length n takes place according to the 
following rule: 


 
wherein *Q is the unary-1 complement of Q. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that in 
a mode of operation in a first channel a constantly 

changing output frequency is generated, and that in a 
second channel there is switching back and forth with 

a switchover frequency between two output frequencies, 
which differ by a difference frequency, and that the 

switchover frequency in the second channel is derived 
from the output frequency in the first channel, 

wherein the switching over in the second channel is 
controlled on the digital level either by a square-wave 

signal in the first channel or by a selected bit 
of the signal in the first channel.  

 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
switching over in the second channel takes place in 

phase-continuous manner. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
control of the DDS (1) takes place by means of manual 

input to the computer (2) or is directly integrated in 
a measuring program running on the computer (2). 
Device for the operation of a direct digital 
synthesiser (1) which contains one or several channels 

(A, B ...) each with a phase increment register with 
a bit width n, with a controlling computer (2), which 

transmits information bits to the input of the direct 
digital synthesiser (1), characterised by an operating 

control for carrying out the following phase increment 

control operations:
 
Addition of a phase increment Q with the bit length n 

to a stored phase value P with the bit length n: 

 
Subtraction of a phase increment Q with the bit length 

n: 

 
wherein *Q is the unary-1 complement of Q. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
computer (2) comprises a standard printer interface 

(2a) or another parallel interface through which the 
information bits can be transmitted.  

 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
information bits transmitted by -the computer (2) are 

either address bits or data bits and that the computer 
(2) is connected to the input of a multiplexer, the 

output of which is connected to the input of the DDS 
(1), and that the multiplexer ensures that the 

information bits transmitted by the computer become 
effective in the DDS (1) either as address bits or as 

data bits. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
computer (2) is connected to a hardware log (4) and 

that the output of the hardware log is connected to 
the input of the DDS (1) and that the multiplexer is 

contained in the hardware log.
