<ABSTRACT>
To prepare a mixture of sodium silicates with sheet structure and sodium carbonate peroxohydrate, a sodium silicate which consists essentially of  delta -Na2Si2O5 is reacted with continuous circulation at least partially with carbon dioxide and atomised water to form a kanemite/sodium bicarbonate mixture. The kanemite/sodium bicarbonate mixture and further sodium silicate, essentially consisting of  delta -Na2Si2O5, is contacted with continuous circulation with atomised water. Finally, 0.015 to 1.5 mole of hydrogen peroxide per mole of sodium silicate essentially consisting of  delta -Na2Si2O5 used are added to the resulting kanemite/sodium carbonate mixture.
