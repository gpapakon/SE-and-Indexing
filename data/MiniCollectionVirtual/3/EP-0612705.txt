<ABSTRACT>
Method for preventing fouling in unsaturated hydrocarbon, 
particularly fouling due to one or more carbonyls present 

or formed in unsaturated hydrocarbon, characterized in 
that an additive formed by a solution of at least one 

hydride in a solvent is added to the unsaturated 
hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for preventing fouling 
due to condensation reactions of one 
or more carbonyls present or formed in unsaturated 
hydrocarbons. Such fouling usually takes place as a result of free 
radical polymerization which is chemically and/or 
thermally initiated by contaminants such as oxygen or 
metal ions, or condensation reactions of alpha, beta 
unsaturated carbonyl compounds and the like (Aldol 
condensation, Cannizzaro reactions, Knoevenagel 
condensation, Perkin reactions, Diels-Alder addition 
reactions). The recovering of alkenes from gas or liquids, the 
transformation of alkene or acetyl compounds by means of 
distillation, the catalytic hydrogenation, 
dehydrogenation or dehydrochlorogenation, the pyrolytic 
dehydrogenation or dehydrochlorogenation, acylation, 
alkylation, chemical and physical adsorption and 
absorption, compression, extraction, etc. are hindered by 
such fouling. Not only during these processes, but also 
during the storage and the transport of the unsaturated 
hydrocarbons can fouling occur on the equipment used. In particular during the extraction and purification of 
1,3 butadiene by solvents such as furfural, acetonitrile, 
dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or 
dimethylformamide, depositions of polymeric elements 
hinder during the extraction, the finishing operation,  
 
the gas recovering and storage. Also during the production of ethylbenzene and cumene 
with the so-called wet alkylation (Friedel-Crafts 
catalysts), unwanted by-products and organic polymers 
arise in the reaction itself, the catalytic 
neutralisation and product recovering. Fouling also takes place in the units for the 
absorption/adsorption and chemical conversion of organic 
and inorganic sulphur compounds during the treatment of 
hydrocarbons, in particular during the removal of 
hydrogen sulphide, thiophenes, mercaptans and other 
organic and inorganic sulphur compounds from natural gas 
and oil products or the processing thereof. The invention aims to provide a method according to which 
the formation of these unwanted fouling is prevented in 
a simple manner. To this aim, an additive formed by a solution of at least 
one hydride in a solvent is added to the unsaturated 
hydrocarbon. US-A-3 527 821 discloses the incorporation of an 
effective amount of discrete particles of finely divided sodium borohydride in 
olefinic hydrocarbon. This is however not to prevent 
condensation reactions of carbonyls 
but to destruct hydroperoxid contaminants and 
thus to stabilize the
