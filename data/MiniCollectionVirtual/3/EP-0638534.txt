<ABSTRACT>
The dehydrogenation of an alkane to an alkene, especially isobutane 
to isobutene, is carried out in admixture with oxygen and in the absence of added 

steam over a dehydrogenation and oxidation catalyst comprising a platinum group 
metal deposited upon a support. A catalyst comprising platinum deposited on a 

support which is a mixture of tin oxide and zirconium oxide possesses good 
activity for the dehydrogenation of an alkane, especially carried out in this way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for the dehydrogenation of
an alkane to form an alkene.It is known to dehydrogenate isobutane to isobutene using direct
dehydrogenation at low space velocity (GHSV=100-1000hr-1). The conventional
industrial process has several inherent disadvantages:
(a) it is an endothermic reaction, requiring high thermal input; (b) the yield of isobutene is equilibrium limited; and(c) at temperatures favouring high yields of isobutene, the rate of
catalyst de-activation is also high.Improvements to the conventional process have included the addition
of either steam (eg USP 4,926,005 and 4788371) or hydrogen (eg USP 4,032,589)
to the gas feed. The function of the hydrogen is as a diluent, and to reduce the
deposition of carbon on the catalyst. The steam improves thermal conduction
through the catalyst bed and reduces the deposition of carbon on the catalyst, and
hence it too has been used as a diluent. The catalysts used in industry include
platinum on alumina, platinum on tin oxide and chromium oxide-based catalysts.
There remains a need for an improved process for the dehydrogenation of alkanes,
especially for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which is a starting material for
MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl-ether) production. The conventional processes require
high inputs of energy and the capital cost of a catalytic reactor designed to supply
large amounts of heat is particularly high. Moreover, conventional processes
demonstrate rapid catalyst deactivation, so that expensive and complex catalyst
regeneration has to be designed into the equipment and the process.The present invention provides an improved process
for alkane dehydrogenation.Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the
dehydrogenation of an alkane to form an alkene, comprising passing a feedstock 
comprising said alkane in the gas phase in admixture with oxygen and in the
absence of added steam over a dehydration and oxidation catalyst comprising a
platinum group metal deposited upon a support.The present process is advantageous over the known
processes by reason of one or more of such features as higher yield of
the alkene, higher selectivity to the alkene, lower operating temperature, lower heat
input, a simpler system and lower catalyst deactivation.There is much prior art on the dehydrogenation of alkanes to
alkenes, (though a scant amount on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to
alkenes), yet the present improvements were not realised before. As explained in
the US specification 4788371 mentioned
