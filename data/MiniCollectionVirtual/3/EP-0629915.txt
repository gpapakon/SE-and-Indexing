<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for arraying sheets of photosensitive 
material provided in a film printing (X)/developing (Y) apparatus. 

Along the path to 
a lower outlet are mounted one-way rollers (36) and high-speed 

rollers (37), so that the sheets of photosensitive material (PC) in a 
two-line zigzag arrangement will be fed at high speed. The 

sheets of photosensitive material thus fed out of the lower 

outlet are overlapped one upon another on the pan by means 
of a conveyor (39) in the order of the frames in one roll of 

film. 
Optionally a sorting guide (33) is provided for selectively feeding 
the sheets of photosensitive material (PC) according to their size. The 

sorted sheets are fed further either in a one-line arrangement or in a 
two-line zigzag arrangement to an upper outlet or to the lower outlet by 

guides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for arraying
sheets of photosensitive material used to array the printed
and developed sheets of photosensitive material according
to a predetermined order.In a conventional film printing/developing apparatus,
a roll of photosensitive material is fed continuously to an
exposure unit in which a film image in each frame on a
negative film is exposed onto a sheet of photosensitive
material on an exposure table. After the sheets of
photosensitive material have been fed to a developing unit
and developed while passing through a tank containing
developing solutions, they are dried and drawn out.The photosensitive material to be exposed on the
exposure table is cut into sheets before developing. The
sheets are fed in a line to the developing unit, in which
there is a gap between the sheets of photosensitive
material to avoid the contact therebetween.In such a conventional film printing/developing
apparatus, the speed for developing the sheets of
photosensitive material in the developing unit is much
lower than the speed for exposing the images onto the
sheets in the exposure unit. Therefore, in order to 
increase the capacity of the film printing/developing
apparatus, it is necessary to increase the capacity of the
developing unit.On the assumption that the sheets of photosensitive
material are fed in one line, one method proposed was to
increase the rack length in the carrier device to increase
the number of the sheets developed per hour. However, the
longer the rack length is, the longer the length of the
developing unit as a whole, the larger the size of the tank
and the more the amount of the developing solutions are.As another solution, it was proposed to stagger the
feed direction of the exposed sheets of photosensitive
material and adjust the feed direction while they are being
fed to develop them in a zigzag arrangement.With this developing method, it is possible to
increase the capacity of the developing unit considerably
without increasing the rack length of the developing unit.However, since the sheets of photosensitive material
are staggered and fed in two lines in the developing unit,
if the order of the sheets of photosensitive material is to
correspond to the order in one roll of film, the sheets fed
in two lines have to be rearranged in one line again.Let us suppose that a conveyor continuously driven is
provided near the outlet of the developing unit to overlap
them to the order in one roll of film. In this case, when 
the preceding sheet is placed

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (30) for arraying sheets of photosensitive
material in a film printing/developing apparatus having a

printing unit and a developing unit, said apparatus
comprising:


a carrier means comprising a plurality of pairs of
one-way rollers (36) and a plurality of high-
speed (37,37a,37c) rollers for
feeding the sheets of photosensitive material near the

outlet (38) of the film printing/developing apparatus in a two-line zigzag arrangement; and
a conveyor (39) arranged to be provided outside of said outlet in a
direction perpendicular to the direction in which the

sheets of photosensitive material are discharged by said high-speed rollers, so as to
be driven intermittently.
An apparatus for arraying sheets of photosensitive
material as claimed in claim 1 wherein each of said high-speed

rollers comprises driving rollers (37), mating rollers (37a) and
a pair of rollers (37c) having a larger diameter than said mating

rollers and arranged at both sides of said mating rollers
so as to feed the sheets of photosensitive material in an

arcuate shape.
An apparatus for arraying sheets of photosensitive
material as claimed in claim 1 wherein a sorting guide (33) is 

provided upstream of said one-way rollers to selectively
feed the sheets either to said one-way rollers or to a

stock in means according to the size of the sheets of
photosensitive material.
