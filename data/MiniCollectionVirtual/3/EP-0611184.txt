<ABSTRACT>
Applicator unit for a cosmetic product, including a reservoir (2) containing the product and an applicator member (5), consisting of at least one circular segment (53) made of flexible material integral in rotation with a rod (6) via which it is mounted in rotation in a casing (3) integral with the reservoir (2) containing the product, it being possible for the said rod (6) to be actuated in rotation from the outside; the casing (3) includes two openings (32, 33), an inner opening (32), placing the reservoir (2) and the casing (3) in communication, and an outer opening (33) opening outwards; the applicator member (5) is mounted movably between at least two positions, a postion permitting contact of the segment (53) of the applicator member (5) with the product contained in the reservoir (2), and a position in which the said segment (53) laden with product is at least partially placed in line with the outer opening (33) in order to enable it to emerge from the casing (3) and to serve for applying the product, the applicator member (5) tending, by passing, by means of rotation, from one to the other of the said positions, to tamp down the product which is thus compacted on the applicator member (5).

<CLAIMS>
Applicator assembly for a cosmetic product, 
comprising a container (2) holding the product, and an 

applicator device (5, 105, 205, 305, 405) consisting of 
at least one circular segment (53) made of flexible 

material, integral in terms of rotation with a spindle 
(6) by means of which it is mounted rotatably in a casing 

(3) which is integral with the container (2) holding the 
product, it being possible for the said spindle (6) to be 

set in rotation from the outside, the casing (3) of which 

assembly comprises two openings (32, 33), an inner 
opening (32) establishing a communication between the 

container (2) and the casing (3), and an outer opening 
(33) which opens towards the outside, the applicator 

device (5, 105, 205, 305, 405) being mounted movably 
between at least two positions, one position allowing the 

segment (53) of the applicator device (5, 105, 205, 305, 
405) to come into contact with the product held in the 

container (2), and one position in which the said segment 
(53), charged with product, is at least partially brought 

into line with the outer opening (33) in order to allow 
it to emerge from the casing (3) and serve for application 

of the product, the applicator device (5, 105, 205, 
305, 405) having a tendency, as it passes by means of 

rotation from one to the other of the said positions, to 
pack the product, which is therefore compacted on the 

applicator device (5, 105, 205, 305, 405), characterized 
by the fact that the segment (53) of the said applicator 

device (5, 105, 205, 305, 405) is at least partially 
compressed in the direction of the rotation spindle (6) 

in a zone (312) between the inner opening (32) and outer 
opening (33). 
Applicator assembly according to Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the casing (3) consists of a 

shell (31) whose side walls are, in line with the said 
zone, at a distance from one another which is smaller 

than the axial thickness of the segment (53) of the 
flexible applicator device (5, 105, 205, 305, 405), the  

 
said thickness being measured when the applicator device 

(5, 105, 205, 305, 405) is free, not in use. 
Applicator assembly according to Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the casing (3) consists of a 

shell (31), and at least one pressure plate (316) is 
arranged axially between a side wall of the shell (31) 

and the segment (53) of the applicator device (5, 105, 
205, 305, 405). 
Applicator assembly according to Claim 3, characterized 
by the fact that the pressure plate (316) is 

integral with a push-button (317) passing through the 
side wall of the shell (31). 
Applicator assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized by the fact that the casing (3) 

consists of a shell (31), the lower opening (32) being 
formed on the lower edge of the shell (31) and comprising 

notches formed in the side walls of the shell (31), the 
edge (32
a
) of the lower opening (32) having the shape of 
a bevel inclined from the outside towards the inside over 

the entire perimeter of the lower opening (32), the said 
segment (53) of the applicator device (5, 105, 205, 305, 

405) being arranged in line with the said notches. 
Applicator assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized by the fact that it comprises a cap 

(4) fitted on the casing (3). 
Applicator assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized by the fact that the applicator 

device (5, 205) consists entirely of a flexible foam. 
Applicator assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized by the fact that the applicator 

device (205) is made of a semi-flexible thermoplastic 
which has undergone a surface flocking treatment. 
Applicator assembly according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized by the fact that the applicator 

device (105) consists of a circular hub (154) of rigid 
material, on which a ring (155) of flexible foam is
