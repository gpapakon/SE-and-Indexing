<ABSTRACT>
A plastic strip (tape, belt) has, in the two edge regions, devices for releasable, mechanical connection of the longitudinal edges of the strip, where at least one edge region preferably comprises different material to that of the film region of the strip extending between the two edge regions. The strip, including the mechanical connection devices, can be produced by extrusion. The mechanical connection devices of the first edge region are in the form of a receiving part and the mechanical connection device of the upper edge region are in the form of an insertion part.

<CLAIMS>
Shrinkable plastic strip having arrangements (1, 1A)
provided in its two marginal regions for the re-releasable

mechanical connection of the said two
marginal regions, and having a sheeting section (2)

provided between the said marginal regions, the
plastic of the marginal regions and the plastic of the

sheeting region having differences in characteristics,

characterised in that
 the plastic of the marginal
regions, or of the arrangements (1, 1A) provided

therein, has a higher crystallite melting point than
the plastic of the sheeting section (2) extending

between the two marginal regions.
Plastic strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 at least one of the marginal regions consists of
a cross-linkable polymer, such as a polymer based on

HDPE or LLDPE or PVDF or polyamide.
Plastic strip according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the sheeting region (2) consists of a cross-linkable
polymer, such as a polymer based on PE or

PVDF or polyamide.
Plastic strip according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the strip, including the
mechanical connecting arrangements (1, 1A), is

manufactured by extrusion.
Plastic strip according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the strip has been cross-linked
and then drawn under heat in the region of the

sheeting section (2), preferably in a ratio of 1:2 or
1:3, and cooled, as a result of which the said

sheeting section (2) is made heat-shrinking. 
Plastic strip according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the mechanical connecting
arrangements on the one marginal region are

constructed as a receiving part (1A) and the
mechanical connecting arrangements on the other

marginal region are constructed as a plug-in part (1).
Plastic strip according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the receiving part (1A) has a claw (5) and also a
sealing lip (6) lying opposite the said claw.
Plastic strip according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the plug-in part (1) has a hook (7) which can be
received in the receiving part, and a protective lip

(8) which lies opposite the said hook.
Plastic strip according to claims 7 and 8,

characterised in that
 the receiving part has a sealing
material (9), preferably bitumen, in a compartment

provided for the hook (7) of the plug-in part (1).
Plastic strip according to one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 at least one partial region of
the strip has a coating (10) of a hot-melting adhesive

on at least one surface.
Plastic strip according to claim 10, 
characterised in

that the crystallite melting point of the hot-melting
adhesive lies in the region of the crystallite melting

point of the sheeting section (2).
