<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally concerned with envelope 
flap moistening apparatus and more particularly with a 
mailing machine through which envelopes may be fed at 
different rates and including envelope flap moistening 
apparatus including a flap moistening brush overlaying a 
pad of wicking material mounted in a fluid supply well 
which is constructed and arranged to facilitate the. 
appropriate transfer of fluid to and from the well over a 
wide range of envelope feeding rates. In U.S. Patent No. 4,643,123 for an Envelope Flap 
Moistening Apparatus, issued February 17, 1987 to 
Auerbach and assigned to the assignee of the present 
invention, there is disclosed an envelope feeding machine 
with envelope flap moistening structure including a 
source of supply of fluid, having a pad of wicking 
material mounted therein, and including a brush disposed 
in overlaying relationship with the supply, and thus with 
the pad, for transferring fluid from the supply via the 
pad to the brush bristles, and, when an envelope flap is 
fed beneath the brush bristles, for transferring fluid 
from the brush bristles to the envelope flap for 
moistening the same. In U.S. Patent No. 3,905,325 for an Envelope Flap 
Moistening Apparatus, issued September 16, 1975 to 
Labore, et. al, there is disclosed envelope flap 
moistening structure including a moistening blade having 
a fluid supply cavity formed in its upper surface, for 
receiving fluid from a remotely located source of supply 
of fluid, and having a slot extending downwardly from the 
fluid supply cavity to the lower surface thereof for 
transferring fluid from the cavity via the slot to an 
envelope flap when the flap is fed into engagement with 
the lower surface of the blade and thus across the slot, 
to moisten the gummed surface of the flap.  
 Further, on pages 110, 448-451, 454 and 455 of the International Mailing 
Machines (IMS)/ Hasler Technical Manual, dated January 1987, there is disclosed 
envelope flap moistening structure including a source of supply of moistening fluid 
having a well and a pad of wicking material mounted therein, wherein the pad is 
held in place in the well by a pad retaining member having a screen-shaped upper 
wall and having depending side walls connectable to the structure forming the well, 
and wherein the brush is removably connected to the moistening structure. In US Patent (US-A) No. 4 958 453 of the present Applicant, there is 
described and illustrated a mailing machine base comprising: a housing including 
an upper wall

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for supplying moisture to the flap portion (23) of an envelope, 
having a body portion (20) and said flap portion, the apparatus comprising: a 

substantially solid rectangular pad (70) made of a material capable of upwardly 
transferring fluid by capillary action; means (72) for supplying fluid to the pad, the 

fluid supplying means including a source of supply of fluid, the fluid supplying 
means including an elongate well (80) having an elongate substantially rectangular 

base wall (82), the well including a pair of elongate substantially rectangularly-shaped 
and oppositely-spaced side walls (84), the well (80) including a pair of 

substantially rectangularly-shaped and oppositely-spaced end walls (86) extending
