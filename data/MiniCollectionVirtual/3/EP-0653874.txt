<ABSTRACT>
A document reproduction system with a first large imaging 
platen (12a) on 

which documents are scanned by moving an imaging system thereunder, 
and an 

automatic document feeding system (ADF) for sequentially feeding 
documents 

to a directly adjacent smaller second (removable) imaging platen (12b) 
where the 

same imaging system may be stationarily positioned. A recess 
is provided 

between the opposing edges of the first and second platens extending 
substantially below their upper surface. The ADF has a document 

lead edge 
member extendable down into this recess to positively catch 

and deflect 
documents away from the upper surface of the second platen after the 

documents have been moved over this surface and imaged. The first and second 
platens are abutting at their lower surfaces, below the notch, 

to define a 
contiguous lower surface. The recess may be formed by an 

inclined beveled end (5b) 
of the first platen. The imaging station is preferably not centrally 

of the second 
platen, and the second platen reversible, to change the position 

of the imaging 
station thereon. The first and second imaging platens have coplanar 

upper and 
lower surfaces and are comonly mounted. The ADF has two trays which 

overlie 
the first platen and one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document reproduction
system according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a document reproduction system according to the preamble
of claim 1 is suggested by DE-A-2 709 427.From further prior art US-4 699 365 a single platen
recirculating document feeder is known having a pivotable ramp
at the platen's end to allow discharging or returning a document
sheet from/to the platen.General background art for the present invention is disclosed in
US-5 201 505 showing document handler with a single
platen and overlaid input and output trays for stacking document
sheets. There is further extensive art on two tray simplex or duplex document feeders for
light-lens copiers in which the documents are fed by a constant velocity transport
(CVT) past a narrow scanning slot, which is usually a separate imaging station or
window, separate from the large platen used to scan stationary documents,
including books. i.e., two separate imaging platens, a large platen for scanning
documents with moving optics, and a narrow platen for a document CVT with
stationary optics. Some examples include Canon U.S. 4,312,587; 4,110,030;
4,247,192; 4,456,369; 4,515,458; 4,318,609; 4,395,118; and other patents cited
herein. The latter two are examples of CVT document imaging systems adjacent
to the platen where the platen scanning carriage can be moved to and parked at
the CVT document imaging position for alternative imaging there.Further by way of background, it is known that a CVT (constant velocity
transport or moving document) scanner can provide rapid (and more closely
spaced) document exchange times at the imaging station, to help, e.g., provide
scanning at greater than 50 scanned documents per minute. Xerox Corporation
has made CVT [slit scan] type document handlers for copiers with otherwise
normal large stationary document moving optics platens, such the Xerox
Corporation "3100 LDC" [see, e.g., U.S. 4,017,172 issued April 12, 1977 to Thomas
Lynch]; and even earlier CVT-only large document or engineering drawing
copiers. A recent example of a Xerox Corporation commercial large document
copier with a dual nip and dual speed reversible CVT is disclosed in U.S. 4,996,556
(D/89229) issued Feb. 26, 1991 to G. A. Grey, Jr.There is also patent art on CVT duplex (both sides imaged) document
handlers specifically for electronic (digital) imaging with a raster input scanner
(RIS). A RIS may be either of the full width array (FWA) type, or a smaller RIS CCD
array or chip with lens image reduction. Scanners may

<CLAIMS>
A document reproduction system with

a first large imaging platen (12a) on which documents (18) placed thereon are
scanned by an imager system (14) moving under said first platen,
a second and smaller imaging platen (12b); and
an automatic document feeding system for automatically sequentially feeding
documents to be imaged;
wherein said automatic document feeding system being adapted to feed
documents to be imaged onto said smaller second imaging platen (12b) by

moving the documents onto the upper surface of said second imaging platen
(12b) toward said first imaging platen and past a fixed position imaging station

(16) at said second imaging platen; and
wherein said imager system (14) is stationarily positioned at said fixed position
