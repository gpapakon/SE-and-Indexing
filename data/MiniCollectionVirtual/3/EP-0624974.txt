<ABSTRACT>
When inserting a subpicture into the main picture on 
a TV screen, a blanking signal is used to blank out the main 

signals and to substitute them with the subsignals. 
In TV systems where the transients of the subsignals come 
instantaneously with the transients of the accompanying 

blanking signal, the subsignal due to its finite slope may 
have not yet reached its full amplitude in the area of the 

border between the main picture and the subpicture. This 
results in a faint border area between the main picture and 

the subpicture. To prevent this effect the subsignals of 
pixels at the border are replaced by subsignals of 

neighbouring pixels, in cases where subsignals of pixels at 
the border do not have their full amplitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a TV system for inserting a sub-picture
into a main picture on a TV screen by using a blanking signal for switching between a
main signal and a sub-signal.It is common use in video processing to mix pictures. The
insertion of a subpicture into the main picture is
effected by switching off the main signal, which builds up
the main picture, in those parts of the scanning lines
where a subsignal, which builds up the subpicture, is to
be inserted.Mixing of two pictures is no problem in analog technology.
However, in TV sets where the analog signal is digitized,
skew errors can occur in the displayed subpicture. These
skew errors result in jagged borderlines between the main
picture and the inserted subpicture. Some prior art TV
signal processing circuits deal with the elimination of
border structures such as the jerkiness of a border.European Patent 0 304 308 relates to a digital television
system for simultaneously displaying a plurality of
pictures on a single screen. This digital television
system locks the main system clock signal in phase to the
timing signal used for inserting the subpicture into the
main picture.German Patent 30 27 053 discloses a method for correcting
a digital switching signal that is used to switch between
a main picture and a subpicture. The correction of the
digital switching signal is effected by interpolating the
digital switching signal between two sampling points. Both of the above mentioned patents can be used to
eliminate just one kind of border structure, namely, jerky
borderlines between a main picture and an inserted part of
a subpicture.European Patent 0 235 902 describes a method and apparatus
for inserting a subpicture into the main picture. To
avoid sharp transitions at the border between the main
picture and the subpicture, the subpicture overlaps the
main picture in the area of the border between the two
pictures. In its simplest form, an algorithm may be used
that effects a gradual change in the overlapping region
from 0% of the subpicture and 100% of the main picture to
100% of the subpicture and 0% of the main picture. This
publication also mentions that, in more complex cases, the
algorithm may be applied not only to the two overlapping
pixels but also to adjacent pixels from the main picture
and the subpicture. However, it does not disclose an
algorithm of this kind.In the article "Signal processing for a Digital HDTV chroma key mixer" in proceedings of
