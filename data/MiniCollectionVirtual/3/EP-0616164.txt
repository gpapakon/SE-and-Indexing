<ABSTRACT>
Seal (2) for coupling with instantaneous connection using clamping or pinching, made up of an axisymmetric annular body bounded by two parallel radial faces (4, 5), an outer cylindrical surface (6) surmounted by a partially toric bead (7) centered on the mid-plane of the seal parallel to the faces (4, 5), a partially torric inner surface (9) also centered on the mid-plane and coupled to each radial face by a conical surface (10, 11) forming a chamfer.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing gasket constituted by a circularly symmetrical 
annular body defined by two parallel radial faces (4, 5), 

an outer cylindrical surface (6) surmounted by a partially 
toroidal bulge (7) centered on the midplane of the gasket 

parallel to said radial faces (4, 5), a partially toroidal 
inner surface (9), also centered on the midplane, and 

connected to each of the radial faces via a respective 
chamfer-forming conical surface (10, 11). 
A gasket according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
radius of the toroidal bulge (7) is smaller than the radius 

of the inner toroidal surface (9). 
A sealing device for a tube (3) housed in the bore (B) 
of a body (C), in particular a quick-connection coupling, 

said bore (B) including a cylindrical bearing surface (1a) 
and a shoulder (1b), and the device comprising a gasket 

according to claim 1 or 2 extending between the tube (3) 
and the cylindrical bearing surface (1a) of the bore (B). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
shoulder (1b) of the bore forms a conical surface whose 

apex points in the same direction as the direction in which 
the tube is inserted in the bore (B). 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
apex angle of the conical surface (1b) is of the order of 

160Â°.
