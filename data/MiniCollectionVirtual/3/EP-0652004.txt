<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating resistant neoplasms 
comprising administering to a human or other mammal in 

need of treatment an effective amount of a compound 
having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino, a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Along with surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy
continues to be an effective therapy for many cancers. In
fact, several types of cancer are now considered to be
curable by chemotherapy and include Hodgkin's disease,
large cell lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, testicular
cancer and early stage breast cancer. Other cancers such
as ovarian cancer, small cell lung and advanced breast
cancer, while not yet curable, are exhibiting positive
response to combination chemotherapy. One of the most
important unsolved problems in cancer treatment is drug
resistance. Drug resistance includes both intrinsic
resistance at the time of treatment using chemotherapy and
acquired drug resistance. This problem is a reason for the
added importance of combination chemotherapy, as the
therapy both has to avoid the emergence of resistant cells
and to kill pre-existing cells which are already drug
resistant.Anthracyclines represent an important class of
oncolytic agents. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline, which is
also known in the art as Adriamycin™, is a drug of choice in
the clinical management of breast cancer. Therapy with
anthracyclines such as doxorubicin is complicated by the
appearance of the anthracycline resistant phenotype which
limits or negates the oncolytic activity of doxorubicin.Topoisomerase inhibitors represent a further class
of oncolytic agents. Epipodophyllotoxins such as Etoposide®
and Teniposide® are topoisomerase inhibitors which are useful
in the therapy of neoplasms of the testis, small-cell lung
and other lung, breast, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas, acute granulocytic leukemia and Karposi's sarcoma.
The therapeutic utility of the epipodophylotoxins is limited
by the appearance of the epipodophyllotoxin resistant
phenotype. One form of multi-drug resistance, (MDR), is
mediated by a membrane bound 170-180 kD energy-dependent
efflux pump designated as P-glycoProtein, P-gp. P-gp has
been shown to play a major role in the intrinsic and acquired
resistance of a number of human tumors against hydrophobic,
natural product drugs. Drugs that act as substrates for and
are consequently detoxified by P-gp include the vinca
alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine), anthracyclines
(Adriamycin), and epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide). While P-gp
associated MDR is a major determinant in tumor cell
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, it is clear that the
phenomenon of MDR is multifactorial and involves a number of
different mechanisms. One such alternative pathway for
resistance to anthracyclines involves
