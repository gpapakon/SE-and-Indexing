<ABSTRACT>
A combined floor cleaning and floor polishing 
machine comprises a motor housing (1), an inclined 

operator handle (2), a base (3) with castors (4) and a 
motor-operated shaft (5) for a rotating disc (7) 

supporting interchangeably a cleaning pad or polishing 
pad, so that the machine weight is carried partly on the 

pad and partly on the castors (4). 
If the handle (2) is tilted the machine moves 
laterally to one side or other in dependence upon the 

direction of tilt. The use of elastomeric torsion 
blocks (8) to connect the motor housing (1) to the base 

(3) provides an elastic resistive force in either tilt 
direction and thus improves controllability of the 

cleaning/polishing movement in either lateral direction, 
by a simple, robust and inexpensive construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined mechanical 
floor cleaner and floor polisher. Mechanical floor cleaners or floor polishers 
typically possess a circular pad driven to rotate about 
a vertical axis by an electric motor mounted on a frame 
or housing located above the pad, and an upwardly angled 
operating handle extending from the frame or housing 
generally upwards to a suitable height for use. Such cleaners or polishers can be readily caused to 
move to or fro transversely by the operator. This is 
done by lifting or lowering the handle, so as to tilt 
the pad and cause either the front half or the rear half 
of the pad to engage relatively more strongly with the 
floor and thus give the pad a useful sideways component 
of motion. By judicious tilting motion of the handle 
the operator can move slowly forwards or backwards and 
effectively clean or polish a wide track of the floor to 
either side of his personal movement.  
 Historically, there have been problems in providing 
a single machine for both cleaning and polishing 
purposes. It is not difficult to design suitable pads 
and adapt them for selective interchange, but the weight 
of the original machines was such that while the optimum 
speed of the motor, or a suitable ratio could be used 
for polishing, the more robust action of cleaning would 
generate enough friction to stall the motor or to give 
undesirable wear, noise, and heat problems. European Patent 0122181 shows an earlier solution to 
this problem. In this patent, the weight of the 
equipment is largely carried by the two rear castor 
wheels, but the weight of the pad and motor is generally 
supported on a separate sub-frame tiltable about a 
transverse axis in relation to the remainder of the 
equipment by virtue of a linkage adjustably attached to 
a suitable part of the handle. Thus, when the handle is 
raised or lowered the sub-frame is tilted accordingly 
and the pad is tilted so that the equipment moves 
transversely as required. Because the total weight is 
split between the castors and the pad, high speeds 
suitable for dry scrubbing/polishing can also be used 
(with a changed pad) for cleaning purposes. Although such equipment is valuable for the purpose 
stated, provision of a mechanical linkage adds to cost 
and complexity, as does the need to adjust the link  
 
connection for each different user so as to give a 
comfortable working height. Moreover, the link movement 
has regions of insensitivity, giving a less controlled 
or lunging sideways movement, especially

A combined floor cleaning and floor polishing 
machine of the type possessing a base (3) with floor 

engaging castors (4); a rearwardly and upwardly 
extending handle (2); and a motor means (1) attached to 

the handle and mounted on the base (3) and including a 
vertical or substantially vertical downwardly extending 

rotary shaft (5) to drive a selectively changeable pad, 
whereby the weight of the machine is distributed in use 

between the castors (4) and the pad: characterised in 
that the motor means (1) is mounted on the base by one 

or more elements (8) to permit controllable tilting of 
the motor means (1) and its attached pad in either 

direction against an elastic resistive force. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 in which the or each 
mounting element (8) is made of elastomer. 
A machine as claimed in claim 2 in which elastomeric 
mounting elements (8) are provided which respond 

elastically in torsion. 
A machine as claimed in claim 3 in which the 
mounting elements (8) are in the form of elastomeric 

blocks generally aligned one to either side of the motor 
means.  

 
A machine as claimed in claim 4 in which the blocks 
are two flat cylindrical blocks (8), with axes aligned, 

located one to either side of the motor means. 
A machine as claimed in claim 5 in which the blocks 
are flat cylindrical blocks of elastomeric material 

sandwiched between metal plates (10). 
A machine as claimed in claim 2 in which one or more 
elastomeric mounting elements are provided which respond 

elastically in compression and extension. 
A machine as claimed in claim 7 in which a single 
mounting element is provided in the form of a single 

block or layer of elastomer completely or partially 
filling any gap between the motor means and the base. 
A machine as claimed in claim 7 in which a spaced 
pair or plurality of blocks of elastomer is located in 

any gap between the motor means and the base. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 in which the or each 
mounting element is made of metal. 
A machine as claimed in claim 10 in which one or 
more metal mounting elements are provided which respond 

elastically in torsion.  
 
A machine as claimed in claim 11 in which two flat 
metal springs in spiral or part-spiral form are fixed, 

with central axes aligned, between, at their 
extremities, one of either the motor means or the base 

and, at their centres, the other of either the motor 
means or the base.
