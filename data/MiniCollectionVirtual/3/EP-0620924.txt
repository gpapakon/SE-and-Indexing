<ABSTRACT>
An optical grating includes a sequence of grating lines, the sequence being such that each grating line is centred on a position which is an integer multiple of a line spacing distance from a datum position on the grating, the sequence of grating lines is non-periodic and the sequence of grating lines is formed from N concatenated subsequences. Each subsequence comprising a series of one or more instances of a respective grating line pattern. Such an optical grating has a structure that is more amenable to calculation of the grating lines necessary to achieve a desired characteristic. A method of calculating and fabricating such a grating is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical gratings.An optical grating can be considered to be a sequence
of grating lines. The lines modify the reflection and
transmission characteristics of an optical transmission
medium to which the grating is applied so allowing the
characteristics to be tailored, to a greater or lesser
degree, to a desired application. For example, an optical
grating is used in a distributed feedback laser (DFB) to
control the wavelength at which the laser is able to lase.
In another application, an optical grating is used to
control the transmission characteristics of an optical
waveguide, for example an optical fibre.An article titled "D-Fibre Grating Reflection
Filters", P Yennadhiou and S A Cassidy, OFC 90 (1990)
describes a D-fibre mounted on a flat substrate to expose
the optical field in the fibre core. A holographically
formed grating was placed on top of the substrate to give
a periodic sequence of changes to the effective refractive
index seen by the electric field. The changes in
refractive index caused by the grating are very small but
at each change in Index there is a small amount of light
reflected back down the fibre. At a certain resonant
wavelength these small reflections build up through
constructive interference to provide a large reflection
whose magnitude is determined by the length of the grating
and the size of the refractive index change. For a
periodic grating with an arbitrary index profile this
resonance occurs where the grating period is an integer
multiple of half the wavelength, λ/2, divided by the mean
effective index n0. In the special case when the index
profile is a sequence of discrete jumps, the resonance only
arises when the period is a odd multiple of λ/(2n0).At wavelengths around the exact resonance, the
reflection has a characteristic "sin (λ)/λ" wavelength
response profile of a finite-sized grating. The width of
response peak is roughly inversely proportional to the
grating length unless the reflectivity is very high. (see 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). When the peak reflectivity is high
then multiple reflections become important and the
reflection profile no longer narrows with increasing
grating length. Instead the response flattens at around
100% reflectivity near the peak with very strong side lobes
in the vicinity of the peak (see Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).This characteristic profile is very difficult to
change with conventional design methods. In particular, if
the periodic change in effective refractive index is fixed
by the material properties, then
