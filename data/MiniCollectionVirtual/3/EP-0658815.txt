<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hydrazone 
compound useful as a charge transporting material for use in an 
electrophotographic photoreceptor, an organic electroluminescent 
element, and the like. The present invention also 
relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor and an organic 
electroluminescent element both containing the hydrazone 
compound. Electrophotography is a kind of image-forming process, 
which generally comprises charging the surface of a 
photoreceptor containing a photoconductive material in the dark 
by means of, e.g., corona discharge, image-wise exposing the 
resulting photoreceptor to selectively eliminate the charge in 
the exposed area to thereby obtain an electrostatic latent 
image, converting the latent image into a visible image using 
a toner, transferring the toner image to paper, etc., and then 
fixing the toner particles to obtain an image. Photoreceptors include inorganic photoreceptors 
containing an inorganic photoconductive compound, e.g., 
selenium, zinc oxide, cadmium sulfide, or silicon, as a major 
component and organic photoreceptors containing an organic 
charge generation material and a low- or high-molecular organic  
 
charge transporting material both of which are dispersed in a 
binder resin. The inorganic photoreceptors each has many 
advantages and has been widely used so far. However, those 
inorganic photoconductive compounds have the following 
drawbacks. For example, selenium not only is costly because of 
the difficulty of the production thereof, but also tends to 
crystallize and to be readily affected by heat or mechanical 
shock to thereby suffer performance deterioration. Zinc oxide 
and cadmium sulfide are insufficient in moisture resistance and 
mechanical strength, and a dye added as a sensitizer is 
deteriorated by the charging and exposure. Thus, 
photoreceptors containing zinc oxide or cadmium sulfide are 
defective in durability, etc. Silicon is also costly because 
of the difficulty of the production thereof and because a 
highly irritant gas is used for producing the same. Moreover, 
care should be taken in handling silicon because it is 
sensitive to moisture. For the purpose of overcoming the drawbacks of these 
inorganic photoreceptors, organic photoreceptors containing 
various organic compounds have been investigated in recent 
years and have come to be used widely. The organic 
photoreceptors include single-layer photoreceptors in which 
both a charge generation material and a charge transporting 
material are
