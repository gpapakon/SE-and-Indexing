<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a method and apparatus for coating substrates by a liquid spray so as to avoid entrapment of gaseous bubbles, particularly air bubbles, in the coating and desirably to thereby obtain bubble-free coatings. More particularly, the invention involves spray applying the coating to a substrate in an atmosphere consisting of gases having appreciable solubility in the applied coating, such as carbon dioxide, such that gas bubbles that may become entrapped in the coating are removed after application by the gases dissolving into the coating and diffusing to the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, in general, pertains to the
field of coating substrates. More particularly, the
present invention is directed to methods and
apparatus for coating substrates by a liquid spray so
as to avoid entrapment of non-soluble gaseous
bubbles, typically air bubbles, in the coatings and
desirably to obtain bubble-free coatings.Coating compositions are commonly applied to
a substrate by passing them under pressure through an 
orifice into air in order to form a liquid spray,
which impacts the substrate and forms a liquid
coating. In the coatings industry, three types of
orifice sprays are commonly used; namely, air spray,
airless spray, and air-assisted airless spray.Air spray uses compressed air to break up
the coating composition into droplets and to propel
the droplets to the substrate. The most common type
of air nozzle mixes the coating composition and
high-velocity air outside of the nozzle to cause
atomization. Auxiliary air streams modify the shape
of the spray. The coating composition flows through
the orifice in the spray nozzle at low pressure,
typically less than 124110 Pa (18 psi). Air spray is used to
apply high quality coatings because of its ability to
produce a fine droplet size and a "feathered" spray,
that is, the spray has a uniform interior and tapered
edges. Such a feathered spray is particularly
desirable so that adjacent layers of sprayed coating
can be overlapped to form a coating with uniform
thickness. However, because of the high air volume
that is used, air spray deposits the coating
inefficiently onto the substrate, that is, it has low
transfer efficiency, which wastes coating.Airless spray uses a high pressure drop
across the orifice to propel the coating composition
through the orifice at high velocity. Upon exiting
the orifice, the high-velocity liquid breaks up into
droplets and disperses into the air to form a liquid
spray. The momentum of the spray carries the
droplets to the substrate. Spray pressures typically
range from 4826.5 to 34475 kPa (700 to 5000 psi).
The spray tip is 
contoured to modify the shape of the spray, which is
usually a round or elliptical cone or a flat fan.
Because no compressed air is used, airless sprays
deposit the coating composition more efficiently onto
the substrate, that is, it has higher transfer
efficiency, than air sprays. However, its use is
generally limited to applying low quality coatings
because it characteristically does not provide a
"feathered" spray or fine atomization. Conventional
airless spray techniques are known to

<CLAIMS>
A method for the liquid spray application of
coatings onto a substrate which minimizes entrapped non-soluble

gaseous bubbles comprising:

a) forming a liquid coating composition containing
at least one polymeric compound capable of

forming a coating on a substrate;
b) spraying said liquid coating composition at a
substrate;
c) providing one or more gases which are soluble
in said polymeric coating composition so as to

create a first atmosphere encompassing the
sprayed liquid coating composition;
d) coating the substrate; and
e) subjecting the coated substrate to a second
atmosphere containing said one or more soluble

gases in lower concentration than in the first
atmosphere so that the one or more soluble

gases diffuse from the coated substrate into
said second atmosphere,

characterized in that said soluble gases in step c) are
provided at a velocity which prevents or minimizes turbulent

mixing of surrounding non-soluble gases into the sprayed
liquid coating composition.
The method of Claim 1, wherein the first atmosphere
is provided by entraining the soluble gases in the coating

composition as it is being sprayed.
The method of Claim 1, wherein the first atmosphere
is a closed system containing said soluble gases. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein the second atmosphere
is air.
The method of Claim 1, wherein the coating
composition is admixed with supercritical fluid prior to

spraying.
The method of Claim 5, wherein the supercritical
fluid and the soluble gas are the same.
An apparatus for the spray application of a liquid

b) means for supplying at least one substrate;
c) means for providing one or more

through which the soluble gases pass.
The apparatus of Claim 8, wherein the spraying means

providing the first atmosphere is a distributor plate
positioned at said discharge end of the spray gun, said

distributor plate having a perforated front face facing the
spray as it leaves the discharge end and a back face facing

away from the spray, and wherein the first atmosphere is
provided by supplying said soluble gases through the

perforated front face of the distributor plate.
