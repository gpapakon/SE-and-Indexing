<ABSTRACT>
Hard polyurethane foams are produced by reacting: 1) polyisocyanates with 2) compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms active with respect to isocyanates with 150 to 1 500 molecular weight, and having a tertiary nitrogen atom in the molecule, in the presence of 3) hydrofluoroalkanes as foaming agents and if required in the presence of 4) other additives and, auxiliary substances known per se.

<CLAIMS>
The use of

1. polyethers of a molecular weight of from 150 to
1500, having at least two hydrogen atoms active

to isocyanates and which contain one tertiary
nitrogen atom in the molecule and which have been

obtained by reacting triethanolamine or
ethylenediamine with propylene oxide and/or

ethylene oxide, for increasing the solubility of
pure hydrocarbons in the polyol component during

the production of rigid polyurethane foams by
reaction with
2. polyisocyanates in the presence of
3. pure hydrocarbons as blowing agents and
optionally in the presence of
4. other auxiliary substances and additives known
per se.
The use according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

component 1) is a polyether having a molecular weight
of from 250 to 500.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 cyclopentane is used as blowing agent.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 n-pentane and/or i-pentane is used as blowing
agent.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 2,2-dimethylbutane is used as blowing agent. 
The use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 mixtures of n-pentane, i-pentane and/or
cyclopentane and/or cyclohexane are used as blowing

agent.
