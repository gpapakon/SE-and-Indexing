<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed to cover the lens (35) of a video camera (36) with a transparent foil (37) which can be pulled off a feed roll (38) and received on a take-up roll (39). The take-up roll is connected to an electric stepping motor which, following a signal, advances the foil in one work cycle by at least a length corresponding to the diameter of the lens. The transparent foil ensures that no dirt particles can become deposited on the lens so that the video camera always supplies clear images. The video camera can be used in motor vehicles in order to monitor the traffic situation to the rear and to display it on a monitor.
