<ABSTRACT>
A packaging machine (1) for producing sealed
packages (2) of a pourable food product from a tube (3)

of packaging material, which is sealed longitudinally, is
fed along a vertical downward path (A), is filled

continuously with the food product by means of a fill
conduit (5), and is gripped under pressure and sealed

along equally spaced cross sections; the fill conduit (5)
having, on the outside of a respective end portion (11)

housed inside the tube (3) of packaging material, a
pressure flange (20) having a number of transverse slits

(22) dividing the flange (20) into respective tab
portions (23), which are flexible by the pressure inside

the tube (3) to define, for the food product, respective
passages increasing gradually in section alongside an

increase in pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging machine
for continuously producing sealed packages of pourable
food products.Machines for packaging pourable food products, such
as fruit juice, wine, tomato sauce, pasteurized or long-storage
(UHT) milk, etc., are known, on which the
packages are formed from a continuous tube of strip
packaging material sealed longitudinally and fed
downwards along a vertical path.The packaging material has a multilayer structure
comprising a layer of paper material covered on both
sides with layers of heat-seal plastic material, e.g.
polyethylene, and, in the case of aseptic packages for
long-storage products, such as UHT milk, also comprises a
layer of barrier material defined, for example, by an
aluminium film, which is superimposed on a layer of heat-seal
plastic material and is in turn covered with another
layer of heat-seal plastic material eventually defining
the inner face of the package contacting the food 
product.To produce the packages, the strip of packaging
material is unwound off a reel and fed through a
sterilizing unit in which it is sterilized, for example,
by immersion in a chamber containing a liquid sterilizing
agent, normally a concentrated hydrogen peroxide and
water solution.Once the strip is sterilized, the sterilizing agent
is removed, e.g. vaporized by heating, from the surfaces
of the packaging material; and the strip of packaging
material so sterilized is maintained in a closed sterile
environment, and is folded and sealed longitudinally to
form a tube.The tube is filled with the sterilized or sterile-processed
food product, and is gripped, sealed and cut at
equally spaced cross sections to form pillow packs, which
are then folded mechanically to form the finished, e.g.
substantially parallelepiped-shaped, packages.More specifically, the food product is fed into the
tube of packaging material by means of a fill circuit
having a fill conduit in turn having an open-bottomed
vertical portion extending coaxially inside the tube.To ensure a substantially constant food product
level inside the tube of packaging material during
formation of the packages, known packaging machines
normally also comprise control devices for controlling
food product flow along the fill conduit.In one known solution, the control devices comprise 
a float mounted to slide axially along a bottom end
portion of the vertical portion of the fill conduit, and
connected by a lever connecting mechanism to a throttle
valve for regulating flow along the fill conduit. More
specifically,

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine (1) for producing sealed
packages (2) of a pourable food product from a tube (3)

of packaging material, which is sealed longitudinally, is
fed along a vertical downward path (A), is filled

continuously with said food product by means of a fill
conduit (5), and is gripped under pressure and sealed

along equally spaced cross sections; said fill conduit
(5) having an open-bottomed end portion (11) extending

inside said tube (3) of packaging material and having,
externally, a pressure flange (20) for counteracting

upsurge of the food product along said tube (3) when the
tube (3) is gripped transversely; 
characterized in that

said pressure flange (20) comprises at least one break
region (22) defining at least two adjacent tab portions

(23), which are flexible by the pressure inside said tube
(3) to define, for the food product, a respective passage

increasing gradually in section alongside an increase in
said pressure.
A machine as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said break region of said pressure flange (20)
comprises a transverse slit (22) extending towards said

fill conduit (5) from an outer peripheral edge (21) of
the pressure flange (20).
A machine as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 said pressure flange (20) comprises a number of said
slits (22) equally spaced angularly about said fill 

conduit (5) and defining in between respective said tab

portions (23).
A machine as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 said slits (22) are substantially upside-down-L-shaped,
and each comprise a straight radial first portion

(24) extending from said outer peripheral edge (21) of
said pressure flange (20), and a straight second portion

(25) extending perpendicularly from one end of the first
portion (24) and separated radially from said fill

conduit (5).
A machine as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 said second portion (25) of each said slit (22)
terminates, at the opposite end to the respective said

first portion (24), in a through hole (26) having an axis
parallel to said path (A) and a diameter larger than the

width of the slit (22).
A machine as claimed in Claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that
 said second portions (25) of said
slits (22) extend from one side of the respective said

first portions (24), and are all oriented in the same
direction about the axis (A) of said tube (3) of

packaging material.
A machine as claimed in any one of the foregoing
Claims, 
characterized in that
 said pressure flange (20)
is substantially defined by a thin disk of flexible

material having a central hole and fitted to said end
portion (11) of said fill conduit (5).
