<ABSTRACT>
An aldolisation-dehydration process is disclosed for converting an aldehyde, e.g. n 
&
cir
&
 _-valeraldehyde, to a substituted acrolein, e.g. propyl butyl acrolein (2-propylhept-2-enal). Aldolisation and dehydration are effected in a stirred tank reactor (16; 111) using an alkali catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide. A reaction product stream (23; 113) containing both organic and aqueous phases is distilled (in column 25; 123) to yield a heterogeneous azeotrope containing water and aldehyde. On condensation and phase separation the lower water layer (34; 150) can be discharged from the plant without the need for neutralisation. From the bottom of the distillation zone a mixture (36; 157) of substituted acrolein and alkali catalyst solution is obtained. The substituted acrolein is recovered as product (45; 173), while the catalyst solution (47; 175) is recycled to the aldolisation reactor. Part (49; 181) of the catalyst solution is purged to control the level of Cannizzaro reaction products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of unsaturated aldehydes by aldolisation followed
by dehydration.Aldolisation is a well known process in which
aldehydes undergo dimerisation, typically in the presence of
an alkali metal hydroxide catalyst, according to the
following equation:-

where R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group.
This aldol can then undergo dehydration to form an
unsaturated aldehyde which has twice as many carbon atoms as
the starting aldehyde of formula R.CH2.CHO, according to the
following equation:

For example, n-butyraldehyde forms ethyl propyl acrolein (2-ethylhex-2-enal)
by the reactions:

and

This reaction is commercially practised on a large scale as
part of a process for production of the tonnage chemical, 2-ethylhexanol.
This can be obtained by hydrogenation of
ethyl propyl acrolein: 

This alcohol, i.e. 2-ethylhexanol, is widely used as a
plasticiser alcohol for the production of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate
which is a plasticiser in common use for
plasticising polyvinyl chloride.Plasticiser alcohols have to satisfy stringent
purity criteria, including low acidity, low water content,
lack of colour, and low "sulphuric acid colour". In this
last mentioned test a sample of the plasticiser alcohol is
reacted with concentrated sulphuric acid and the colour of
the resulting solution is measured against a set of standard
solutions, using visual or instrumental methods.In the presence of an iso-aldehyde a mixed aldol
product can be formed. For example, iso-butyraldehyde can
react with n-butyraldehyde as follows:-

and
For a description of the mechanism of the
aldolisation reaction reference may be made, for example, to
the textbook "Organic Chemistry" by I.L. Finar, Second
Edition, published by Longmans (1954), and to pages 127 and
128 thereof in particular.A competing reaction to aldolisation is the 
Cannizzaro reaction:
2R.CH2.CHO + NaOH → R.CH2.COONa + R.CH2.CH2.OHSince higher molecular weight aldehydes, such as n-butyraldehyde,
and aqueous solutions have limited mutual
solubility, the aldolisation reaction is a two phase liquid
reaction. Presumably aldehyde undergoes mass transfer into
the aqueous phase, and rapidly aldolises in the aqueous
phase, and then the aldolisation products transfer back into
the organic phase.Various authors have studied the kinetics of
aldolisation, including:-
