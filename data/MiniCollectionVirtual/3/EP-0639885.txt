<ABSTRACT>
A protection system for a thyristor valve composed of a 
plurality of thyristors connected in series. The protection 

system includes a forward voltage detection circuit for 
generating a forward voltage signal, a first reverse voltage 

detection circuit for detecting that a reverse voltage in 
excess of a first reverse voltage level is applied to the 

thyristor to generate a first reverse voltage signal, and a 
second reverse voltage detection circuit for detecting that 

a reverse voltage in excess of a second reverse voltage 
level larger than the first reverse voltage level is applied 

to the thyristor to generate a second reverse voltage 
signal. The protection system further includes a protection 

circuit for detecting a first time period during when the 
first reverse voltage signal is outputted and a second time 

period during when the first reverse voltage signal is 
outputted and the second reverse voltage signal is not 

outputted, for adding the first and the second time periods 
to generate an addition signal, for generating a decision 

signal when the addition signal is smaller than a second 
predetermined value, and for generating a protection gate 

pulse based on the decision signal when the forward voltage 
is applied to the thyristor. The protection gate pulse is 

applied to all of the thyristors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a protection system for a 
thyristor valve used for DC power transmission e.t.c., and 
more particularly to a protection system for a thyristor 
valve which protects thyristors from voltage stress during 
the forward recovery period. Generally, a thyristor does not recover its forward 
withstand voltage until a certain time has elapsed after the 
end of power conduction. The "turn-OFF time" (Tq) is a 
guide to the time required for this recovery. When a thyristor valve is running as an inverter, the 
reverse voltage period applied to the thyristor after the 
end of power conduction is called the "margin angle" ( γ ). 
Normally, the control angle is selected so that this margin 
angle γ is greater than turn-OFF time Tq. When margin angle γ is smaller than turn-OFF time Tq  
 
due to the generation of waveform distortion in the AC 
system, the thyristor cannot block a forward voltage applied 
following a reverse voltage, and self-fires. This 
phenomenon is called "commutation failure". When thyristors 
are connected in series, randomness will occur in turn-OFF 
times Tq of individual thyristors. Therefore, when margin 
angle γ is small, there will be thyristors with and without 
commutation failure. This phenomenon is called "partial 
commutation failure". Thus, the whole circuit voltage will 
be applied to the thyristors without commutation failure. 
Therefore, when the number of thyristors with partial 
commutation failure is large, a forward voltage greater than 
the withstand voltage will be applied to the thyristors 
which block the voltage. This will sometimes lead to 
damage. To counter this problem, in prior art, the thyristors 
were protected by forcibly turning them on by supplying a 
gate pulse to all the thyristors, if margin angle γ became 
smaller than the maximum value of turn-OFF times Tq of the 
series thyristors. This is called "forced firing 
protection". The details of the above-described prior art protection 
were well described in U.S. Patent No. 4,377,835 issued on 
March 22, 1983 and Canadian Patent No. 1,054,218 issued on 
May 8, 1979. Such prior art forced firing protection had the  
 
following problems. That is to say, turn-OFF time Tq 
depends on the rising rate dv/dt of the applied forwardly 
rising voltage v and peak value of voltage v. However, the 
maximum value of turn-OFF times Tq used in prior art forced 
firing protection which is taken as Tq0 was assumed from 
rising rate dv/dt (several v/µs) in normal operation. When
