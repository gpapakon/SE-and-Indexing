A method for separating volatile components from a base material, particularly 
drilling mud or soil material, wherein 


a) the base material is brought into a gas-tight space (10) and heated, 
b) a vacuum is generated within said gas-tight space (10, 10a), 
c) and the space (10) is swept with an inert gas after a given processing time,
 
characterized by the following further method steps: 
d) the base material is filled into a pot-like induction vessel (26), which is 
brought into the gas-tight space (10, 10a); 
e) said heating of the base material is carried out by inductive heat in the vessel 
(26) and by astirring device (32), which can be lowered into the vessel (26), 

and is heated by a heat carrier, and which stirs the base material at the same 
time, wherein the sections (36) of the stirring device being immersed into 

the base material are connected with a plate which is lowering onto the base 
material; wherein further 
f) after having taken samples and after analysis of the content of volatile components, 
filling height of the base material is adjusted such that height of the 

base material in the vessel (26) is substantially constant after emerging of 
the volatile components, for assuring the plate (34) of the stirring device to 

be lying in contact during the whole processing time. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that nitrogen is used as 
sweeping gas.  

 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that inert gas is injected into 
the base material. 
A device for carrying out the method according to claim 1 having a gas-tight 
reactor (10) receiving the base material,
 
characterized in that
 
a pot-like vessel (26) is provided in the reactor (10, 10a),
 
an inductive coil (18, 20, 18a, 20a) is associated to the reactor (10, 10a),
 
a stirring device (32) is arranged inside the reactor (10, 10a), which device is 

perfusable by a heating medium being supplied from outside the reactor and the 
stirring sections (36) of which device being immersed into the base material 

(28) in the induction vessel (26) are in correspondence with a source of inert 
gas, which emerges from fine emerging openings in the stirring sections (36), 

wherein the stirring sections (36) are in correspondence with a plate (34), which 
can be lowered onto the ground material. 
The device according to claim 4, characterized in that the induction vessel (26) is 
circular. 
The device according to claim 4, characterized in that the plate (34) is in 
correspondence with a hollow shank (38) protruding from the reactor (10, 10a), 

by which shank the heating medium and the inert gas can be supplied. 
The device according to claim 6, characterized in that the shank (38, 40) is 
supported axially adjustable and can be actuated by an adjusting means outside 

the reactor (10).  
 
The device according to claim 7, characterized in that the transducer measuring 
the contact force of the stirring device (32) is associated to the adjusting means, 

and the adjusting means is adjusting the stirring device (32) according to the 
magnitude of the transducer signal. 
The device according to one of the claims 4 to 8, characterized in that the coil 
(18, 20, 18a, 20a) is wound around an isolating coating (14, 14a). 
The device according to claims 4 to 9, characterized in that the wall of the reactor 
space is double-walled and constructed such that a meander-like streaming 

channel (46) is formed, through which the heating medium is flowing for pre-heating. 
The device according to claims 4 to 10, characterized in that also the bottom (50) 
of the reactor (10a) is formed as inductive core. 
The device according to claims 9 to 12, characterized in that two inductive coils 
(18, 20, 18a, 20a
) are provided on both sides of the hollow shank (38) for the 
stirring device (32). 
The device according to one of the claims 4 to 12, characterized in that an additional 
inductive coil is arranged at the reactor for pre-heating of the stirring device. 
The device according to one of the claims 4 to 13, characterized in that a dosing 
and transfer vessel (60) is provided having a lower section (62) and an upper 

section (64) telescopically co-operating with the lower section (62), wherein  
 

fastening means (70) are provided for securing the sections (62, 64) in a given 
position relative to each other. 
The device according to claim 14, characterized in that the bottom (72) of the 
lower section (62) is formed as a shiftable plate.
