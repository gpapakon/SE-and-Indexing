<ABSTRACT>
A machine for cutting grass and the like of the type comprising a frame 
(1a) to which are made integral an operating engine (2), a driving seat 

(3), means (4) for steering the machine and a front grass-cutting plate 

(60), characterized in that such grass-cutting plate (60) comprises at 
least one or more pairs of cutting blades (61) made to rotate via means 

(2a, 63, 66, 67, 61a) of transmission of the drive from engine (2) and 
a guard (62) for protecting such cutting blades, which is extended 

toward the middle part of the machine by a duct (63) capable of 
engaging a cut-grass collecting container (9) located centrally with 

respect to the axes of rotation of front wheels (7) and rear wheel (8) 
of the machine and located in the lower position grazing the ground as 

shown in fig. 3, the action of pushing the cut grass toward such 
container being exerted by the pressure generated by the rotation of 

cutting blades (61).

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a machine for cutting grass and the
like comprising a front grass-cutting plate connected to a cut-grass
collecting container located centrally with respect to the axes of
rotation of the front and rear wheels of the machine, the action of
pushing the cut grass toward such container being exerted by the
pressure generated by the rotation of the cutters.
Particularly, the present invention relates to a machine for cutting grass according to
the preamble of claim 1. There are known in engineering numerous types of self-propelled devices
for cutting the grass of both small and large lawns.Such known devices, however, display numerous disadvantages associated
with their general design which provides for cutting only, without
recovery of the cut grass, the latter being simply ejected sideways
from the mower making subsequent gathering necessary, or else cutting
and recovery of the cut grass is carried out using ancillary means such
as turbines and the like which make oversizing necessary either because
of the overall dimensions of the device or because of the motive power
to be used. There is therefore posed the technical problem of providing
a self-propelled device capable of cutting the grass in the forward
position and at the same time collecting the cut grass without the need
for ancillary components which increase the overall dimensions and
power consumption.Such device should furthermore ensure high manoeuvrability with
suitable edge guides for high cutting accuracy and should be equipped
with means for transmission of movement capable of also allowing
control of the cutting height and adaptation of the cutting plate to
the unevenness of the ground. US-A-4,974,403 discloses a grass cutting machine for use on a walking
operator type lawn mower having a single cutter, wherein the machine is
provided with a centrally located grass collecting container being disposed
above the cutting blade in order to do without a duct or the like
for transmitting the cut grass.Each of the documents FR-A-2 681 216, US-A-4 709 541 and EP-A-0
468 362 discloses a grass cutting machine with a front mounted grass-cutting
plate, in each case the guard protecting the cutters is extended by
a duct toward the side of the machine and not toward the middle part of
the machine.A machine for cutting grass or the like according to the pre-characterizing
clause of claim 1 is known from the EP-A-0 532 068. Within the context of the above mentioned problem, a further technical requirement is
the ability to

<CLAIMS>
A machine for cutting grass and the like of the type comprising a frame
(1a) to which are made integral an operating engine (2), a driving seat

(3), means (4) for steering the machine, a container (9) for collecting
cut grass, a grass-cutting plate (60), comprising at least one pair of

cutters (61) made to rotate via means (2a, 65, 66, 67, 61a) of transmission
of the drive from engine (2) and a guard (62) for protecting

such cutters (61), and a duct (63) extending from the guard to the cut
grass collecting container (9), the action of pushing the cut grass toward

such container being exerted by the pressure generated by the rotation of
cutters (61), characterized in that the grass-cutting plate (60) is located

in front of the machine, the duct (63) extends toward the middle part of
the machine and the container (9) is located centrally with respect to the

axes of rotation of front wheels (7) and rear wheel (8) of the machine. 
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 1,
characterized in that such means of transmission of the drive from

engine (2) to cutters (61) comprise at least one pair of universal
joints (67) consisting respectively of two tubular members (67a, 67b)

telescopically connected to one another and capable of allowing
shifting parallel to itself of the horizonal cutting plane of cutters

(61).
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 1,
characterized in that such container (9) has an opening (9a) capable of

engaging the end of such duct (63) of guard (62) of grass-cutting plate
(60).
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 1,
characterized in that such container (9) is made integral with frame

(1a) via means of connection (9b) capable of allowing lateral movement 
of container (9) out of the machine as well as its rotation around a

horizontal axis to bring about tipping thereof and therefore ejection
of the cut grass.
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 4,
characterized in that such means of connection substantially consist of

a hinge (9b) capable of sliding on guides integral with frame (1a).
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 1,
characterized in that such duct (63) is made integral with container

(9) by means of at least one hinge of substantially horizontal axis to
enable cutting plate (60) to adapt to the ground on locating any

unevenness in the said ground.
A machine for cutting grass and the like according to claim 1,
characterized in that the rotation of cutters (61) determines the

overpressure needed to blow the cut grass into container (9) through
duct (63).
