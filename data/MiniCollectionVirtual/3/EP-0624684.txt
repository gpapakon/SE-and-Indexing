<ABSTRACT>
A screening cylinder for screening suspensions of lignocellulose-containing 
fiber material. The screening cylinder (10) is formed 

with bar-shaped portions (11), which between themselves form gaps 
(12) extending along the entire length of the cylinder (10). The 

bar-shaped portions are held together by a number of supporting 
rings (14) arranged on the cylinder (10) and extending all about 

the same. The screening cylinder further is provided with a plurality 
of strips (15) extending along the entire length of the 

cylinder (10) or parts thereof and raising above the bar-shaped 
portions (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screening cylinder for a device for 
screening suspensions of lignocellulose-containing fiber material. The screening of suspensions of fiber material has the object to 
separate coarse particles in the form of shives, fiber bundles 
and other impurities from the fiber material, or to fractionate, 
i.e. to separate long and short fibers. The screening normally 
is carried out in screening devices comprising a stationary or 
rotary screening cylinder. The screening cylinder is provided 
with apertures or slits, through which the fibers, but not the 
impurities, can pass. Screening cylinders of this kind are manufactured normally by 
drilling apertures or milling slits in a metal sheet, which then 
is formed to a cylinder. In order to obtain an open area as large 
as possible, the apertures or slits must be arranged densely. At another method of forming a screening cylinder, the cylinder 
is made of bars, which are held together by supporting rings in 
such a way, that gaps are formed between the bars and extend in 
the entire length of the cylinder see documents EP-A-0 067 912 and US-A-5 011 065. Such a screening cylinder has 
many advantages over a conventionally slitted screening cylinder, 
for example a greater open area and a higher selectivity in 
respect of shives separation and fractionating. The bars, 
alternatively, can be formed of a metal sheet by arranging a 
great number of parallel grooves therein. It can be advantageous to form the surface of the screening 
cylinder in such a way, that the upstream edges of the gaps are 
located on a higher level than the downstream edges, seen in 
the relative motion direction of the suspension. This offers 
many advantages from a screening-technical point of view. 
Screening cylinders comprising gaps of this kind have a,o, a 
higher capacity and high shives separation capability. In certain  
 
cases, however, for example when capacity has priority, it can be 
desirable to form the screen surface plane or so that the downstream 
edges are located higher than the upstream edges. By forming the screening cylinder according to the present invention 
it is possible to additionally improve the efficiency and runnability 
of the screening device. The characterizing features of the invention are defined in the 
attached claims. The invention is described in greater detail in the following, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings showing an embodiment of 
the invention.
