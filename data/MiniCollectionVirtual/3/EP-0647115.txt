<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning cloth that is to be stretched on a wiping frame for same has pockets for receiving opposite ends (S) of a clamping bracket (S). The cloth is characterized in that it has a bead or stiff edge (18) which extends along its longitudinal sides, on the outside of a parallel seam (16), as well as a bead (20) located inside with regard to the seam (16). The seam (16) forms a kind of tilting joint for the reinforcement (18; 20) made of both beads.

Cleaning cloth for stretching onto a wiper frame intendend 
for such a cleaning cloth, with pockets for receiving the opposite 

stretching bow ends (S), having a bead (18) which extends 
along the longitudinal sides of the cleaning cloth and lies to 

the outside relative to a seam (16) parallel to the cloth and 
having a bead (20) which lies to the inside relative to the seam 

that seam (16) forming a tilting articulation for both beads. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the cleaning cloth (10) is turned back on itself (12, 14, 

10) at least twice at the edge and stitched, the resulting outer 
bead (18) being at least three-layered, and the resulting inner 

bead (20) being at least two-layered. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in either of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the material of the cleaning cloth 

is a single material and consists of cloth of natural origin 
with pile. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the inner bead (20) is the inner spar, 

acted on by the stretching bow frame (S), of the tilting arrangement 
(18; 20). 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the width of inner bead (20) 

and/or outer bead (18) amounts to approximately 2 cm relative to 
the seam (16). 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized by a knitted support material with a pile 
which is secured thereon and consists of smooth fibers, to each 

one of which there is closely associated a sawtooth-shaped fiber. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that 50% of the sawtooth-shaped fibers are welded in each case 

to a smooth fiber, wherein some of the fibers consist of cotton. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 1, characterized by 
a spacer (60) on one side of which, for example the upper side, 

there is a long pile (56), and on the other side of which, for 
example the underside, there is a short pile (58). 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 1, characterized by 
that a band of elastic material such as rubber (54) is sewn into 

the pockets (52). 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 9, characterized in 
that a turned-back end of the rubber band (54) is stitched on 

the round body, for example of the long pile, and the other end 
is stitched through the spacer (60) to the second pile side 

(58). 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that a two-layer rubber band is sewn in, the inner layer 

being shorter than the outer layer. 
The cleaning cloth as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that two such floor cloths are secured with their backs towards 

each other and with a spacer between them, wherein both floor 
cloths possibly have different properties. 
Cleaning cloth for stretching onto a wiper frame intended 
for such a cleaning cloth, with pockets for receiving the opposite 

stretching bow ends (S), having a bead which extends along 
the longitudinal sides of the cleaning cloth and lies to the  

 
outside relative to a seam (16) parallel to the cloth characterized 

in that the outer bead (32, 34) consists of a needled 
and/or stiffened part protruding vertically downward (34), and 

if appropriate additionally upward, from the horizontal plane of 
the cleaning cloth (Figure 4; 5).
