<ABSTRACT>
A novel circuit and method for providing amplitude and phase 
compensation for a balun in order to provide first and second 

voltage signals that are balanced has been provided. The 
compensation is achieved by adding an amplitude and phase 

compensation circuit such as a transmission line (14) or inductive 
(20) and capacitive (22) lumped elements in series with one of the 

ports of the balun on the balanced side. The amplitude and phase 
compensation circuit includes a characteristic impedance 

parameter (Zo) and an electrical length parameter (Eo) that are 
optimized such that the amplitude difference between first and 

second voltage signals is minimized, while the magnitude of the 
phase difference between first and second voltage signals is 

maximized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to baluns and, in particular but not 
limited to, a circuit and method for compensating baluns. A balun is a well known device having a single ended 
(unbalanced) side and a balanced side. The function of a balun is to 
provide voltages at first and second ports of its balanced side 
which are substantially equal in amplitude and substantially 180° 
out of phase with respect to each other. In other words, the balun 
is to provide equal and opposite voltages to a balanced load with 
respect to ground. When utilizing a balun, the balun must be impedance matched 
with the rest of the system in order to minimize losses and 
distortion and maximize bandwidth, for example, in balanced 
amplifier applications. In trying to match the balun with the 
system, the prior art utilizes traditional measurements on the 
single ended side of the balun. For example, in measuring the 
frequency response of a balun, first and second baluns are serially 
coupled wherein their balanced sides are interconnected. A signal 
is applied at the single ended side of the first balun, while the 
signal appearing at the single ended side of the second balun is 
observed. From this measurement, one can obtain the bandwidth, 
insertion loss and return loss for each balun (assuming that each 
balun is substantially identical). However, these measurements do 
not convey any information about the amplitude and phase 
relationships appearing at the balanced side of the balun. Hence, there exists a need for recognizing that the amplitude 
and phase of the voltage signals appearing at the balanced side of a 
balun may degrade with frequency and for further providing a 
circuit and method for providing compensation for such amplitude  
 
and phase degradation. Briefly, the present invention provides a circuit and a method 
for amplitude and phase compensating first and second voltages 
appearing at the balanced side of a balun. The present invention 
first realizes that the amplitude and phase of the voltages 
appearing at the balanced side of a balun do indeed degrade with 
frequency. Further, the present invention provides an amplitude 
and phase compensation circuit having a predetermined optimized 
electrical length and characteristic impedance that is inserted in 
series with a port on the balanced side of the balun. The 
characteristic impedance is optimized such that the amplitude 
difference between first and second voltage signals is minimized. 
Further, the electrical length is optimized such that the magnitude
