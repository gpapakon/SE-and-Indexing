<ABSTRACT>
In a method for effecting an increased expression in serum-free medium of recombinant proteins in a host cell being able to express said protein said host is cultured in a serum-free medium comprising an egg yolk fraction being free of lipoprotein and lipids so as to express said protein. Also the use of an egg yolk fraction being free of lipoprotein and lipids for increasing the expression of recombinant proteins in a host cell being able to express said protein in a serum-free cell growth medium is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
IMPROVED RECOMBINANT PROTEIN PRODUCTIONTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to a method for effecting an increased expression of recombinant proteins in serum-free media.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA number of proteins having biological activity, e.g. blood coagulation factors such as Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, and Factor XIII, immunoglobulins or serum albumin have traditionally been isolated from body fluids such as serum as their only source. However, as some of the proteins are only present in small amounts, a vast number of donors have to be involved in order to allow isolation of the proteins in indu¬ strial scale. This has given rise to increased concern due to the risk of transferring blood borne diseases which together with the limitation on the natural ressources has enhanced the search for alternative methods for producing such proteins in industrial scale without such risks.Hemophilia A is an X-chromosome-1inked inherited disease which afflicts 1-2 males per 10,000. The desease is caused by an ab- sence of deficiency of Factor VIII:C. Factor VIII:C is a very large glycoprotein (native Mr 330 K - 360 K) , which is present in plasma at extremely low concentrations. It is a necessary element in the proteolytic cascade which converts soluble fi- brinogen to insoluble fibrin, forming a clot to prevent blood loss from traumatized tissue. In the bloodstream, it is found in noncovalent association with von illebrand factor (v F) which acts as a stabilizing carrier protein. Factor VIII:C is very susceptible to cleavage by thrombin, plasmin, activated protein C, and other serine proteases. It is generally isolated from plas-ma or plasma products as a series of related polypep- 

tides ranging from Mr 160 K-40 K with predominant species of Mr 92 K and Mr 80 K-77 K. This complex pattern has made the analy¬ sis of the structure of active Factor VIII:C very difficult.Recombinant proteins produced according to the invention may be Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, and Factor XIII which may be used for substitution therapi in individuals having deficiencies in the coagulation cascade, immunoglobulin which may be used for treating infectious diseases or serum albumin which may be used as substitute for blood transfusion during operations or a constituent of a culture medium.Recombinant proteins having Factor VIII:C activity being prepared according to the present invention may be full length Factor VIII:C corresponding to the protein isolated from plas¬ ma, or a derivative
