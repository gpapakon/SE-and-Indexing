<ABSTRACT>
An article (2) in which at least part of a surface (8) of a polymeric element has an embossed pattern (6). The article may be either heat-recoverable or non-heat recoverable. If the article is heat-recoverable, when heated the article recovers and the embossed surface becomes substantially smooth. The change in surface texture can be used to indicate that sufficient heat has been applied to the article to achieve adequate recovery and/or to adequately melt an attached adhesive layer (10). In another embodiment, the article (2) is in the form of a patch (14) which can be used to secure the opposing longitudinal edges of a heat-recoverable article which is in the form of a wraparound sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of indicating adequate recovery of
heat-recoverable articles.A dimensionally recoverable article is an article the
dimensional configuration of which may be made substantially to
change when subjected to treatment. Usually these articles
recover towards an original shape from which they have
previously been deformed, but the term "recoverable" as used
herein, also includes an article which adopts a new
configuration even if it has not been previously deformed.A typical form of a dimensionally recoverable article is a
heat-recoverable article, the dimensional configuration of which
may be changed by subjecting the article to heat treatment. In
their most common form, such articles comprise a heat-shrinkable
sleeve made from a polymeric material exhibiting the property of
elastic or plastic memory as described, for example, in U.S.
Patents Nos. 2,027,962 (Currie); 3,086,242 (Cook et al); and
3,597,372 (Cook).
The polymeric material has been
crosslinked during the production process so as to enhance the
desired dimensional recovery. One method of producing a heat-recoverable
article comprises shaping the polymeric material
into the desired heat-stable form, subsequently crosslinking the
polymeric material, heating the article to a temperature above
the crystalline melting point (or, for amorphous materials the
softening point of the polymer), deforming the article, and
cooling the article while in the deformed state so that the
deformed state of the article is retained. In use, because the 
deformed state of the article is heat-unstable, application of
heat will cause the article to assume its original heat-stable
shape.Recoverable articles are commonly used to cover objects,
such as pipes or cables, having a tubular elongate configuration
to provide, for example, environmental sealing protection.
Where the diameter of the pipe is very large, thus making
extrusion of a sufficiently large tubular sleeve difficult, or
where no free end of the elongate object is available, it is
common to use a wrap-around article, i.e. an article, typically
in the form of a sheet, that is installed by wrapping it around
the object to be covered so that opposed longitudinal edges
overlap. A closure means is applied to secure together the
opposed longitudinal edges of the wrap-around article. Such
articles are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,200,676 (Caponigro
et al), 4,586,971 (Wallace), and 4,803,104 (Peigneur et al).Recovery of the article is generally achieved by heat, e.g.
from a torch,

<CLAIMS>
A method of indicating adequate recovery of a heat-recoverable
article (2), said method comprising


(1) providing a heat-recoverable article comprising
a polymeric element, said element comprising


(a) a first surface (8) which has an embossed
pattern (6) over at least part of the surface;

and
(b) a second surface (12)
(2) positioning the second surface (12) of the
article adjacent to a substrate (4); and
(3) applying sufficient heat to the article to
cause the article to recover and to cause the

first surface of the article which comprises
the embossed pattern to become substantially

smooth.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the substrate
comprises a pipe.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
article further includes an adhesive layer (10)

which is positioned adjacent to the second surface.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the applied
heat is sufficient to cause the adhesive (10) to

flow.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the embossed pattern covers at least 20% of the

first surface. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein the embossed
pattern covers substantially all of the first

surface.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the depth of the embossed pattern is at least 0.050

mm.
A method according to claim 7, wherein the depth of
the embossed pattern is at least 0.075 mm.
A method according to any preceding claim wherein
the article is in the form of a hollow tube, a

sheet, or a laminar strip.
