<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a multi-stage fiber 
amplifier in which first and second stages are connected by 

means including a filter for attenuating the amplified 
spontaneous emission. The pump source consists of a pair 

of light sources that are connected to a coupler that 
splits the power equally to two output legs. All of the 

pump power from the second coupler output leg is supplied 
to the second stage. A portion of the pump power from the 

second coupler output leg is converted in the first stage 
to amplified signal and amplified spontaneous emission, and 

the remainder of the power from that leg is supplied to the 
second stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical amplifier 
for optical communications, and more particularly, to a 
multi-stage fiber amplifier in which the total available 
pump power, which is supplied from a single source, is 
optimally divided between the stages to provide maximum 
gain and minimum noise for a given spectral response. High output power amplifiers are required for many 
applications, including, for example, multi-wavelength 
systems. One of the key performance characteristics of an 
amplifier is its output power, which is largely governed by 
how efficiently the pump light is converted into signal 
light. In amplifiers doped, for example with erbium, but also 
in amplifiers doped with other gain ions, the input 
available for amplification comprises not only the signal 
but also the spontaneous emission (SE). To reduce 
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), pump power cannot be 
reduced, as it is needed for conversion to signal power. 
(Fig. 1). Previous proposals to reduce ASE amplification, 
require additional circuitry and components, such as 
filters, multiplexer couplers, or several pump sources (see 
IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 4, page 1340-1348,  
 
December 1992; Electronic Letters, Vol. 26 page 661, 662, 
May 10, 1990; U.S. Patent 5,050,949. GB-A-2 253 514 discloses a fiber amplifier according to the preamble of claims 1 and 9. The invention also applies to fiber amplifiers containing 
gain ions other than erbium, since ASE also diverts pump 
power from the signal in amplifiers utilizing gain ions 
other than erbium. The invention is defined in claims 1 and 9. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a multi-stage fiber amplifier in which pump power 
from a single source is unequally coupled to the two stages 
in such a manner that output power is optimized for a given 
spectral response. Another object is to provide a fiber 
amplifier that overcomes the disadvantages of prior art 
devices. Briefly, the present invention relates to a fiber 
amplifier comprising first and second fiber amplifier 
stages, the output spectrum from the first stage including 
a first band of wavelengths that is primarily attributable 
to ASE. The first and second stages are connected by means 
including a filter for attenuating the first band of 
wavelengths. Distribution means connects pump light from a 
source to the first and second stages such that less than 
half of the pump power is converted to signal and amplified 
spontaneous emission in the first amplifier
