<ABSTRACT>
In an ink reservoir (12) for feeding ink (4, 7) to a short-inking device in rotary offset printing machines, even feeding of proportions of circulating ink and new ink is achieved in that the ink reservoir (12), constructed in funnel shape, is divided by means of a partition (24) into a circulation chamber (18) for scraped-off ink and a storage chamber (17) for new ink. Only the amount of ink used from the circulation chamber (18) is made up from the storage chamber (17) so that, during the production run, an even printing quality is guaranteed due to retaining the physical properties of the printing ink.

<CLAIMS>
Ink reservoir (12) for mixing offset printing ink comprising 
a mass flow of wiped-off, returned printing ink containing 

damping medium and a mass flow of newly supplied printing ink, 
the mixed-ink flow being fed to a metering device of a short 

inking unit (12; 4; 2; 1) by means of a pump (7), characterised 
in that the ink reservoir (12) has, separated from one another, 

a first chamber (18) for receiving the returned mass flow and a 
second chamber (17) for receiving the supplied mass flow, in that 

the first chamber (18) and the second chamber (17) are connected 
to one another via an opening (21). 
Ink reservoir according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the opening (21) has a variable cross-section. 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 1 to 2, characterised in 
that the first chamber (18) and second chamber (17) are separated 

from one another by means of a dividing wall (24) having the 
opening (21). 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the opening (21) is arranged at the lower end of the 

dividing wall (24). 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the dividing wall (24) has at its lower end a flexible strip 

(26) positively connected to the dividing wall (24). 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the dividing wall (28) is pivotably mounted at its upper 

side (29) facing the funnel opening. 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the dividing wall (31) has at its lower side facing the 

funnel outlet a strip (33) which is pivotable at hinge points  
 

(32) fixed to the dividing wall and is movable against the force 
of tension springs (34). 
Ink reservoir according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the ink reservoir (12) has substantially a funnel shape and is 

detachably connected to an inlet connection (11) of an ink pump 
(7). 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that a chamber doctor (1) is provided as ink-metering device. 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that the ink reservoir (12) has a width corresponding to half or 

alternatively a quarter of the length of a roller (2) to be inked 
by means of the ink-metering device (1). 
Ink reservoir according to Claims 1 to 10, characterised in 
that the first chamber (18) opens into the inlet connection (11) 

of the ink pump (7).
