<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ribozymes that cleave RNA, 
and more specifically to the enhancement of ribozyme 
catalytic activity using a facilitator oligonucleotide 
complementary to an RNA sequence near or contiguous to the 
RNA sequence to which the ribozyme hybridizes. Furthermore, the invention relates to 
compositions comprising a ribozyme and an effective amount of a facilitator oligonucleotide and to the use of a ribozyme and a facilitator oligonucleotide for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for treating humans and other mammals 
having various viral infections. Drugs might be based on RNA catalysts (ribozymes) 
designed to cleave viral or messenger RNA with high 
specificity at a rapid rate. These requirements 
historically have been mutually limiting. Ribozymes consist of a catalytic core having flanking 
sequences adjacent to the core which hybridize to the 
substrate RNA. The simplest catalytic core is an RNA motif 
known as a hammerhead. Ribozyme specificity depends on the number of base 
pairs formed between the ribozyme flanking sequences and 
its RNA substrate. Increased base pairing has been shown 
to decrease the rate of cleavage. Goodchild and Kohli, 
Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 284: 386-391 (1991). Goodchild 
and Kohli studied the cleavage of a sequence from HIV-1 RNA 
by various hammerhead ribozymes and determined that the 
rate of cleavage was dependent on the length of the 
flanking sequence. Shorter sequences were shown to result 
in weaker binding between the ribozyme and the cleavage 
products together with increased rate of cleavage. A 
ribozyme with 12 base flanking sequences cleaved 10 times faster 
then one with 20 bases. However, to have the requisite selectivity or 
specifity, i.e., the ability to discriminate between all 
RNA molecules in a cell, a ribozyme must form a minimum of 
about 15 base pairs with the target substrate. This  
 
requirement for selectivity limits the rate of cleavage 
that may be realized. Accordingly, ribozymes having increased catalytic 
activity or methods of increasing ribozyme catalytic 
activity are needed. Further, coordination of Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ to a ribozyme at 
the active site is normally required for the ribozyme to 
catalyze sequence specific phosphodiester cleavage of an 
external RNA oligonucleotide substrate. See Nature, 361: 
182-185 (Lehman and Joyce, 1993). The required 
concentration of the Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ is about 20 mM. However, 
there is normally only about a 1-2 mM of these ions 
actually available in a cellular
