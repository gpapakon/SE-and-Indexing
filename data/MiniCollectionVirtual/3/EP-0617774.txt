<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of automatic 
transmission torque converters, which hydrodynamically 
connect an impeller wheel to a turbine wheel. The invention 
pertains particularly to a bypass clutch, which mechanically 
connects the turbine and impeller, bypassing the 
hydrokinetic connection between them, and releases the 
turbine and impeller, thereby reestablishing the 
hydrokinetic effect. The transaxle described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,509,389, which is assigned to the assignee of my 
invention, includes a hydrokinetic torque converter having 
an impeller and a turbine. The housing for the impeller 
includes a lockup clutch assembly having a clutch plate that 
engages a friction surface on the impeller housing. The 
clutch plate carries friction material that establishes a 
frictional driving connection between the impeller and the 
turbine when the pressure differential across the clutch 
plate is sufficient to establish a clutch-engaging force. The clutch plate is connected through a damper 
assembly to the hub of the turbine, thus establishing a 
mechanical torque transfer between an engine crankshaft and 
the turbine shaft, which bypasses the hydrokinetic torque 
flow path through the torque converter. Converter lockup clutch constructions are well 
known in the art, an early prior art teaching being 
described in U.S. Patent 3,252,352, which is assigned to the 
assignee of this invention. Another example of early prior 
art torque converter assemblies having a lockup clutch is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,541,893. More recent prior art teachings include means for 
controlling the application of the torque converter clutch 
by means of an electronic controller that establishes a 
modification of the clutch engaging force under certain 
operating conditions, for example, during shifts when it is  
 
desired to eliminate undesired torque fluctuations and 
engine speed changes during transient periods when torque 
flow interruption is desired. The electronic controller 
establishes a pressure force on the clutch plate that is 
adequate to meet the transient torque transmission 
requirements of the driveline. Examples of this are shown 
in U.S. Patents 4,560,043 and 4,301,900. U.S. Patent 3,541,893, which also is assigned to 
the assignee of this invention, includes a clutch capacity 
modulator valve that establishes a desired pressure in the 
clutch pressure control chamber defined by the impeller 
housing and the clutch plate. The controls for establishing 
the clutch capacity is intended
