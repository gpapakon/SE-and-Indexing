<ABSTRACT>
A horizontal pivot (18) is provided at the rear portions of armrests (2) so that the front portions of the armrests (2) can be 
turned, or the armrests (2) are fixed to rails (33), which are formed vertically with respect to a seat frame, in such a manner that 

the armrests (2) can be moved vertically along the rails, whereby the front portions or the whole of the armrests is sunk downward, 
with a device (20) capable of locking and releasing the armrests (2) on and from the seat frame provided. This invention enables 

the side portions of a seat bottom (9) of even so-called sleeve-carrying armrests, in which accessory parts, such as a table (5), 
can be held in sleeves (4) constituting the armrests (2), of a seat spaced from an adjacent seat at a small distance in various vehicles, 

such as an aircraft, a ship and railway stock, to be exposed greatly, and a physically handicapped person to take or leave his 
seat easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicular seat for a
disabled person wherein, in order that a disabled person can
easily sit on or separate from a seat which is used for
various vehicles such as an airplane, ship or rolling stock,
the front side or the whole of an armrest formed on the
walkway side of the seat is turned in the vertical direction,
to thereby temporarily shift the armrest from the position of
obstructing the sitting or separating action on or from the
seat. More exactly, the invention relates to a seat for a
vehicle comprising a seat frame, a seat back, a seat bottom
and at least one armrest comprising an armrest frame, a wing
extending in the vertical direction and supported to said seat
frame by means of a supporting member fixed to said armrest
frame and a table contained in said wing.In seats for vehicles such as an airplane, ship and rolling
stock, except for the seats in the first class or business
class passenger cabins, such armrests as to be fixed on the
side portions of the seats have been generally used. Further,
in the first class seat having a wide seat pitch, a wheelchair
is accessible to the front of the seat, so that a disabled
person can relatively easily move on the seat from the front
of the seat and sit on the seat; however, in the economy class
or business class seat, the seat pitch is narrow and thereby
the wheelchair cannot be moved to be close to the front of the
seat, so that the disabled person must sit on or separate from
the seat while leaving the wheelchair on the walkway side of
the seat, which causes a problem that the armrest obstructs
the sitting or separating action on or from the seat. To cope
with this problem, there has been proposed a vehicular seat
having the so-called jumping type armrest capable of 
vertically turning the front side of the armrest for allowing
a disabled person to sit on or separate from the seat
therethrough. However, in this construction, even when a stay
for supporting the front side of the armrest is provided, the
strength or the supporting force of the armrest in the normal
service is weak, to thus lower the reliability and durability.For seats disposed at the front row of an airplane even in the
first class, or for seats in the business class, the so-called
armrest with a wing capable of containing a table in a wing
constituting the armrest is used. Further, in seats for the
first class, all the seats include armrests with wings capable
of containing tables in the wings. Even for the seat having
the above armrest with a

armrest frame (16) and a table (5) contained in said wing

(4), characterized in that said armrest (2) is movable in
a downward direction between a first or regular position

where the access to said seat bottom (9) is possible only
from the front of said seat and a second or access

position where at least a side portion (9a) of said seat
bottom (9) is exposed and that said armrest (2) is locked

in said first or regular position by means of a locking
device (20) situated in said wing (4) and connecting said

wing (4) with a supporting device (10, 33),

frame tube (10) adapted to form said seat frame. 
A seat according to claim 2, characterized in that said
fixing member is a column-like sliding shaft (22) which

is disposed in a sleeve (21) provided at the lower end of
said supporting member (17) and positioned coaxially with

the base frame tube (10) adapted to form said seat frame.
A seat according to claim 3, characterized in that a
spring member is provided for biasing said sliding shaft

(22) towards the inner side of said base frame tube (10).
