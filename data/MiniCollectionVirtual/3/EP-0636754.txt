<ABSTRACT>
When fastening cladding panels or the like on the underlying surface by means of fastening elements (1) which can be pushed and driven in by a setting tool (2), the correct fitting thereof can be controlled only with difficulty; but said correct fitting is desirable in order, for example, to avoid finishing work on facades and to prevent accidents due to panels falling off. In order to remedy this, the invention has provided, between the fastening element (1) and a sleeve (21) which guides the actual driving ram of the setting tool (2), a coupling which can be overcome only when a predetermined retaining force of the fastening element (1) is exceeded, advantageously by the reaction force which occurs on the setting tool (2) during the driving-in operation.

A fastening member, in particular for fastening a heat- and sound-insulating panel to a 
substructure, with a retaining part (11) preferably constructed as an injection-moulded 

plastics part and comprising a hollow shank member (11a), which can be driven into 
the panel (5) by means of a driving tool (2), and a thrust plate (11c), which is integrally 

moulded on the shank member transversely to its axis and which is made with a large 
area opposite the shank member (11a), wherein the retaining part can be inserted at 

least so far into the panel (5) by means of a sleeve (21) of the driving tool (2) insertible 
into the shank member that the thrust plate (11c) rests substantially against the surface 

of the said panel, and with a pin (12) of a strong material, in particular of metal, which 
can be inserted into the shank member (11a) and which can be driven into the sub 

structure by the driving tool (2) by means of a striking ram which is movable longitudinally 
in the sleeve (21) and which can be subjected to a striking force, 
characterized 
in that
 a positively locking coupling (4) aimed towards the reciprocal axial movability 
between the shank member (11a) and the sleeve (21) and comprising a respective 

coupling member (41; 42) provided on the internal contour (11e) of the shank member 
(11a) and on the external contour (21c) of the sleeve (21) is provided and can be made 

effective at least when the retaining part (11) is inserted into the panel (5) by means of 
the driving tool (2), and the said panel (5) is releasable only after a pre-set retaining 

force (F
retaining
) of the fastening member is overcome. 
A fastening member according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the tensile force 
(F
tensile
) is applied by the reaction force produced by the striking force (F
pressure
) upon 
the striking ram. 
A fastening member according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the coupling (4) 
is constructed in such a way that it can be released only when a retaining force 

(F
retaining
) fixing the panel (5) to the substructure (6) is exceeded.  
 
A fastening member according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
coupling (4) can be overcome only by its destruction. 
A fastening member according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the coupling (4) can 
be produced in the form of a screw connexion, a snap-on connexion or a bayonet 

closure. 
A fastening member according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 a snap-on connexion 
can be produced by a simple longitudinal movement of the shank member (11a) 

towards the sleeve (21). 
A fastening member according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 at least one projection 
(42) protruding over the preferably cylindrical internal contour (11e) of the shank 

member (11a) and having a run-over slope (42a) for the preferably cylindrical external 
contour (21c) of the sleeve (21) is provided in the shank member (11a), wherein the 

run-over slope (42a) is orientated in such a way that it is effective when the shank 
member (11a) is inserted into the sleeve (21) and the projection (42) can be moved into 

a recess (41) in the sleeve (21) by making use of the run-over slope (42a) and the 
elasticity of the shank member (11a) and/or the tolerances between the internal contour 

(11e) of the shank member (11a) and the external contour (21c) of the sleeve (21). 
A fastening member according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the projection (42) 
and the recess (41) are made annular. 
A fastening member according to one of Claims 7 and 8, 
characterized in that
 the 
projection (42) and the recess (41) have contact faces (41b; 42b) which are orientated 

at right angles to the common axis (3) of the shank member (11a) and the sleeve (21) 
and are opposed to the separation thereof and which lie one upon the other when the 

projection (42) arrives in the recess (41). 
A fastening member according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the pin  
 

(12) can be moved into the retaining part (11) before the shank member (11a) thereof is 
coupled to the sleeve (21) of the driving tool (2).
