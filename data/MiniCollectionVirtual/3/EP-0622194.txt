<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printer (50) having improved print quality 
and full color printing capability on plain paper media. 

A radiant print heater (108) heats the medium (90) at the 
print area to increase the ink carrier evaporation rate. 

The heater includes a wire heating element placed in a 
reflectorized cavity (110) beneath the printing area, and 

radiant heat energy is directed onto the lower surface of 
the print medium through a grill (112). The heating 

element is energized by a low voltage signal. The print 
heater heats the portion of the medium disposed at the 

print area during print operations to cause accelerated 
drying of ink deposited on the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of ink-jet 
printers. With the advent of computers came the need for devices 
which could produce the results of computer generated work 
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this 
purpose were simple modifications of the then current 
electric typewriter technology. But these devices could 
not produce graphics or multicolored images, nor could they 
print as rapidly as was desired. Numerous advances have been made in the field. The 
impact dot matrix printer is still widely used, but is not 
as fast or as durable as required in many applications, and 
cannot easily produce high definition color printouts. The 
development of the thermal ink-jet printer has solved many 
of these problems. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,728,963, issued to S.O. Rasmussen et al., describes an 
example of this type of printer technology. Thermal ink-jet printers employ a plurality of resistor 
elements to expel droplets of ink through an associated 
plurality of nozzles. In particular, each resistor element, 
which is typically a pad of resistive material about 
50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a chamber filled with 
ink supplied from an ink reservoir comprising an ink-jet 
cartridge. A nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of 
nozzles, or openings, with each nozzle associated with a 
resistor element, defines a part of the chamber. Upon the 
energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of 
ink is expelled by droplet vaporization through the nozzle 
toward the print medium, whether paper, fabric, or the 
like. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the 
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are 
conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements.  
 The ink cartridge containing the nozzles is moved 
repeatedly across the width of the medium to be printed 
upon. At each of a designated number of increments of this 
movement across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused 
either to eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according 
to the program output of the controlling microprocessor. 
Each completed movement across the medium can print 
a swath approximately as wide as the number of nozzles 
arranged in a column on the ink cartridge multiplied times 
the distance between nozzle centers. After each such 
completed movement or swath, the medium is moved forward 
the width of the swath, and the ink cartridge begins the 
next swath. By proper selection and timing of the signals, 
the desired print is obtained on the medium.
