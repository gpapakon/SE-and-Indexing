<ABSTRACT>
The effervescent mixture contains at least one acidic, insoluble or sparingly soluble pharmaceutical agent in the form of its soluble alkali metal salt or lysinate, which is present in intimate mixture with the alkaline component and preferably envelops the particles of the alkaline component of the effervescent system, e.g. sodium bicarbonate and/or sodium carbonate. Granules can also be produced from fine powders of the two constituents with the aid of a binder. The effervescent mixture contains, in particular, for 100 parts of agent at least 0.5, preferably 1 to 3, parts of a surfactant, in particular dioctyl sulphosuccinate, and/or at least 1, preferably 3 to 5, parts of a binding or suspending auxiliary, in particular polyvinylpyrrolidone. The acidic component of the effervescent system is surface-passivated.

<CLAIMS>
Effervescent mixture containing an effervescent
system consisting of an alkaline and an acidic

component, and at least one acidic, insoluble or hardly
soluble pharmaceutical drug in the form of its soluble

alkali metal salt or lysinate, which drug is present as
an intimate mixture with the alkaline component of the

effervescent system, characterized in that both the
soluble drug salt and the acidic component of the

effervescent system are passivated on the surface.
Effervescent mixture according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the alkali metal salt or lysinate

- expediently as a mixture with a binder - surrounds
the particles of the alkaline component of the

effervescent system, e.g. sodium bicarbonate and/or
sodium carbonate, and is preferably covered with

further alkali metal carbonate.
Effervescent mixture according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it contains at least 0.5,

preferably 1 to 3, parts by weight of a surfactant, in
particular docusate sodium or sodium laurylsulphate,

per 100 parts by weight of drug.
Effervescent mixture according to any of the
preceding Claims, characterized in that it contains at

least one, preferably 3 to 5, and in particular not
more than 20, parts by weight of binder or suspending

agent, in particular polyvinylpyrrolidone, per 100
parts by weight of drug.
