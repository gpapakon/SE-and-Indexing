<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a single crystal tip which can be 
used, for example, for scanning the topography of a surface. 

The tip comprises a single crystal whisker having a sharpened 
end thereon, which can be mounted on an arm so that the tip 

extends away from the arm. A method of producing the tips/tip 
structures is also provided which utilizes the principles of a 

vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for in-situ growth of 
single crystal whiskers. The whiskers can be utilized as tips 
for scanning the topography of a surface, such as in scanning 
tunnelling microscopy. The tips can also be used as probes, 
sensors, or manipulators in the nanometer scale, or for any 
other application requiring in-situ grown, well defined 
structures. Such applications may involve the optoelectric 
properties of the whiskers, i.e. waveguides. The method 
utilizes a vapor-liquid-solid mechanism to localize and define 
the whiskers. Various microscopy and nano-fabrication techniques 
require a very sharp, well defined tip for operation. For 
example, a broad range of new microscopies have been developed 
which are commonly referred to as "SXM". SXM stands for 
Scanning X (= property to be probed) Microscopy. The common 
objective of each of these is to extend measurements to a very 
high lateral resolution which was not previously attainable 
with conventional means. The whisker structure of the subject 
invention enables the performance of such microscopies with a 
highly reproducible and stable tip structure. It has also been widely recognized that small area 
probes, i.e., the whisker structure of the subject invention, 
can also be used to manipulate and modify materials on a 
length scale not in reach of conventional means. These 
problems have lead to a whole new field of nano-fabrication of 
structures, i.e., for storage, and new device concepts, i.e., 
the atomic watch. In general whisker tips, particularly from silicon 
carbide, exhibit mechanical, chemical, structural, dielectric  
 
and electrical properties which are superior and more 
adaptable to specific applications than other tip materials 
commonly in use. Waveguides, emitters for computer displays, 
etc. represent a subset of technologies that could also 
benefit from the invention. The accuracy and resolution obtainable in such 
applications depends critically on the detailed geometric 
shape of the tip. Other relevant characteristics of the tip 
structure are its chemical stability, mechanical stiffness and 
integrity, and electrical and optical properties. A process 
that can fabricate such structures with high reproducibility 
is crucial. Tungsten wire has found broadest use as tip material. 
However, inherent in the fabrication process of tungsten tips 
is the uncontrolled tip geometry. This results in multiple 
protrusions which act as competing sites of interaction with 
the surface. Also, the chemical
