<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods useful for protecting human or animal eye cell layers and tissues exposed to trauma, e.g., during surgery, are disclosed. In one embodiment, the method comprises administering a protective amount of an ophthalmically acceptable aqueous composition containing a first alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal hyaluronate fraction having a molecular weight of at least about 300,000, for example, in the range of about 500,000 to about 750,000, and a second alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal hyaluronate fraction having a molecular weight of less than about 200,000, for example, in the range of about 25,000 to about 175,000, to eye cell layers and tissues prior to the exposure to the trauma.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending
application Serial No. 621,290 filed November 30,
1990.This invention relates to compositions and methods
useful to protect human or animal eye cell layers and
tissue subject to exposure to trauma. More particularly,
the invention relates to compositions and methods
involving hyaluronate fractions having differing molecular
weights for protecting eye cell layers and tissues exposed
to trauma, for example, during surgery.When the natural lens of the eye becomes hazy or
clouded, surgery is often indicated to remove the impaired
lens. The current trend in such surgery is toward
breaking the lens into a plurality of particles and then
removing the particles, e.g., using the conventional
phacoemulsification procedure. The use of a protective
agent, in particular a viscoelastic fluid, that adheres to
and protects the corneal endothelium during the surgical
procedure is highly beneficial. Fluids containing high
molecular weight range hyaluronates, that is hyaluronates
having weight average molecular weights over 750,000, do
not provide entirely acceptable adhesion to and/or
protection of the corneal endothelium during certain
surgical procedures. An example of such a fluid is that
sold by Pharmacia Ophthalmics of Monrovia, California
under the trademark Healon.Formulations which include hyaluronic acid having a
molecular weight of at least about 750,000, and preferably
at least about 1,200,000 are disclosed in Balazs U.S. 
Patent 4,141,973. Such formulations, which are not
described in this patent as including any lower molecular
weight hyaluronic acid, are disclosed as being useful in
a number of applications, such as in the replacement of
the aqueous humor after various intraocular surgical
procedures, and as a biological prosthesis in the anterior
chamber after cataract surgery.Another formulation which includes high molecular
weight hyaluronate (molecular weight of 1x106 to 4.5x106)
is that disclosed in Balazs U.S. Patent 4,303,672. The
cosmetic formulations of this patent also include a low
molecular weight hyaluronate fraction (molecular weight of
10,000 to 200,000) and protein in an amount ranging from
50% to 400% the weight of the hyaluronate. Such
compositions are taught as having emollient, moisturizing,
elasticizing and lubricating properties where applied to
the skin. Such protein-containing hyaluronate
compositions are not ophthalmically acceptable and would
not be useful as protective agents in eye surgery.Bracke et al U.S. Patent 4,517,295
