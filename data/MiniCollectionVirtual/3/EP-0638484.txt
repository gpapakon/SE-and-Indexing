<ABSTRACT>
A pack 10 of bottles 14 comprises a plurality 
of layers 12. Each layer 12 has its bottles 14 packed 

in a close packed side-by-side array, the array being 
hexagonal. The layers 12 are packed in a sleeve 18 of 

a plastics material. The sleeve 18 is selected to have 
a perimetral dimension slightly less than a peripheral 

dimension of each layer 12 such that the layers 12, once 
packed in the sleeve, are constrained against movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to the packaging of
articles. More particularly, the invention relates to a
method of packaging articles and to a pack of articles.The articles in question are cylindrical
articles which can stand, unsupported, on their ends.
The invention has particular application in the packaging
of lightweight plastics bottles.GB-A-900-833 in the name of Gerard Industries
Limited discloses a method of packing a single layer of
bottles together in a polygonal array. This method
utilises tension members of metal tied above and below
natural pivot points of the bottles to hold the bottles
together in the polygonal array. US patent No.4,919,265 to Lems et al discloses
a combination package of containers comprising an upper
and a lower layer. The articles in the layers are not
packed in the form of a nested polygon. Further, in each
layer, predetermined groups of articles are fastened
together with packaging devices or holders. The layers
are separated from each other by an interlayer comprising
a thin sheet of a flexible material. Further, the packed
layers are retained in position relative to each other by
means of a spirally applied stretch film.According to a first aspect of the invention,
there is provided a method of packaging cylindrical
articles, the method including the steps of
forming a first layer of articles by arranging the
articles side-by-side in rows in a polygonal format with 
articles in one row of said polygon nesting in recesses
formed by adjacent articles in an adjacent row to form a
substantially stable polygon;forming at least one further layer in the same
manner as the first layer, characterised byproviding a sleeve of synthetic plastics material
and closing off a first end of the sleeve by forming a
substantially gable-shaped seal in said first end;inserting the first layer and said at least one
further layer into the sleeve so that, when the first
layer is inserted into the sleeve, opposite sides of the
closed off first end have a tendency to be drawn towards
each other so that the sleeve holds the layers in a
cylindrical pack of polygonal end profile; and further
characterised in thatprior to insertion into the sleeve, the articles of
each formed layer are loose.In this specification the term "loose" means
that the articles in each layer are not tied together in
any manner. In use, the articles in each layer are
merely held together in the required configuration by the
sleeve.To maintain the integrity of the completed
pack, the method may include selecting a holder

<CLAIMS>
A method of packaging cylindrical articles, the method
including the steps of


forming a first layer (12) of articles (14) by arranging the
articles (14) side-by-side in rows in a polygonal format with

articles (14) in one row of said polygon nesting in recesses
formed by adjacent articles (14) in an adjacent row to form a

substantially stable polygon;
forming at least one further layer (12) in the same manner
as the first layer (12), characterised by
providing a sleeve (18) of a synthetic plastics material and
closing off a first end of the sleeve (18) by forming a

substantially gable-shaped seal (24) in said first end;
inserting the first layer (12) and said at least one further
layer (12) into the sleeve (18) so that, when the first layer

(12) is inserted into the sleeve (18), opposite sides of the
closed off first end have a tendency to be drawn towards each

other so that the sleeve (18) holds the layers (12) in a
cylindrical pack (10) of polygonal end profile; and further

characterised in that
prior to insertion into the sleeve (18), the articles (14)
of each formed layer (12) are loose.
The method as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by
selecting a sleeve (18) having an internal peripheral dimension

less than that of an external peripheral dimension of each layer
(12). 
The method as claimed in Claim 2 characterised by
compressing each layer (12) peripherally in order to place it in

the sleeve (18).
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised by forming the gable-shaped seal (24) with

an end portion (26), extending at right angles to a longitudinal
axis of the sleeve (18), having a length dimension less than a

lay flat width of the sleeve (18).
The method as claimed in Claim 4 characterised by
forming side portions (28), one at each end of the end portion

(26), each side portion (28) tapering inwardly from a side edge
(30) of the sleeve (18), in its lay flat form, to the end portion

(26) to form the substantially gable-shaped seal (24).
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised by, after completion of the packing of the

layers (12) into the sleeve (18), closing off an opposed end of
the sleeve (18).
The method as claimed in Claim 6 characterised by
closing off said opposed end of the sleeve (18) by forming a

bottom seal (38) extending across the full lay flat width of the
sleeve (18). 
The method as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7
characterised by, after closing off said opposed end of the

sleeve (18), fastening flap portions (36), formed by excess
material as a result of distortion of the gable-shaped seal (24)

when the layers (12) are packed in the sleeve (18), together to
form a handle for carrying the pack (10).
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised by packing each layer (12) in a hexagonal

format.
A pack (10) of cylindrical articles (14), the pack (10)
including


a first layer (12) of articles (14) arranged side-by-side
in rows in a polygonal format with articles (14) in one row of

said polygon nesting in recesses formed by adjacent articles (14)
in an adjacent row to form a substantially stable polygon;
at least one further layer (12) of the same polygonal format
as the first layer (12); characterised in that the pack (10)

includes
a sleeve (18) of a synthetic plastics material, a first end
of the sleeve being closed off by a gable-shaped seal (24);
the first layer (12) and said at least one further layer
(12) being inserted, after formation of the layers (12), into the

sleeve (18); and in that
prior to insertion of the layers (12) into the sleeve (18),
the articles (14) of each formed layer (12) are loose.
The pack as claimed in Claim 10 characterised in that
the sleeve (18) has an internal peripheral dimension less than

an external peripheral dimension of each layer (12), prior to
insertion of said layer (12) into the sleeve (18).
The pack as claimed in Claim 10 or Claim 11 in which
the gable-shaped seal (24) has an end portion (26), extending at

right angles to a longitudinal axis of the sleeve (18), less than
a lay flat width of the sleeve (18).
The pack as claimed in Claim 12 characterised in that
the seal (24) has a side portion (28) extending from each end of

the end portion (26) to a corresponding side edge (30) of the
sleeve (18), in its lay flat form, such that an included angle

between the end portion (26) and side portion (28) is an obtuse
angle to form the gable-shaped seal (24).
The pack as claimed in any one of Claims 10 to 13
inclusive characterised in that flap portions (36), defined by

excess material of the gable-shaped seal (24) due to distortion
of the seal (24) on insertion of the packed layers (12) into the

sleeve (18), are fastened together to form a handle.
The pack as claimed in any one of Claims 10 to 14
inclusive characterised in that a bottom seal (38) extends across

the full width of the sleeve (18), in its lay flat form, the
bottom seal (38) having been formed after the packing of the 

layers (12) into the sleeve (18).
The pack as claimed in any one of Claims 10 to 15
inclusive characterised in that each layer (12) is in the form

of a polygon where the polygon has an included angle between at
least certain adjacent sides of greater than 90° with the sum of
