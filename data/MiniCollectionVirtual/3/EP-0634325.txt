<ABSTRACT>
For a space-saving packaging of foodstuffs, especially of sausages and cheese, there is proposed a device which engages on a first conveying means in such a way that the conveying means or the supporting surface of the conveying means is displaced at right angles to the conveying direction. Provided, furthermore, is a control which controls both the conveying direction and the sliding movement of the first conveying means, with the result that any shingle-like arrangements of the sliced product are achieved. The ready-shingled portions are transferred from the first conveying means on to a second conveying means and supplied to further processing steps.

<CLAIMS>
A device for arranging sliced products (4 - 8), in 
particular sausage, bacon or cheese in a shingled manner, 

with a slicing machine (1) loading the first conveyor (2) 
with the sliced products (4,5) and with a second conveyor 

(3) arranged in the direction of transport (32) after the 
first conveyor (2), and the conveying movements of the two 

conveyors being essentially parallel, and the first 
conveyor (2) carrying out feed motions of varying length to 

shingle and portion the sliced products, and the second 
conveyor (3) transporting the sliced products (6-8) to 

another processing station, 
characterized in that
 the first 
conveyor (2) also carries out a shifting movement (10) 

which is essentially at right angles to the direction of 
transport (9,32) 
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 after 
the cutting operation conducted by the slicing machine (1) 

the first conveyor (2) carries out a shifting movement (10) 
and / or a transport movement(9). 
A device according to one or both of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 during the shifting movements (10) 
sliced products (4) are capable of being placed onto the 

first conveyor (2) in both directions. 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 the device has a system (20) for 
controlling the shifting movement (10) of the first 

conveyor (2), said control system (20) acting upon the 
conveying drive mechanism (23) and the shifting drive 

mechanism (21). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 the direction of the shifting 
movement (10) is reversed after each portion.  

 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 the movement of transport (9) of the 
first conveyor (2) is carried out in the direction of 

transport (32) of the second conveyor (3) by means of a 
continuous belt conveyor (25), said belt conveyor (25) 

revolving around a means of support (24) and the shifting 
movement being carried out at right angles to the direction 

of transport (9) by means of a working cylinder (21), said 
working cylinder (21) acting upon one side of the means of 

support (24) of the first conveyor (2). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 the direction of transport of the 
first conveyor (2) is capable of being reversed in the 

opposite direction.
