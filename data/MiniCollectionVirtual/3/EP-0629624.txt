formula 


wherein n denotes an integer of 1 to 3; A is an 
optionally substituted heterocyclic residue; Y is a 

divalent hydrocarbon residue; and X is CH or N, or 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have 

excellent hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel tetrazole
derivative having an action of lowering blood sugar and
lipid in blood, and to an agent comprising it for the
therapy of diabetes and hyperlipemia, which is useful in
the field of pharmaceuticals.As remedies of diabetes, various biguanide compounds
and sulfonylurea compounds have so far been used.
However, biguanide compounds are hardly used at present,
since they cause lactic acidosis, while sulfonylurea
compounds, which have a strong action of lowering blood
sugar, often cause severe hypoglycemia, requiring special
attention in use. Tetrazole derivatives having
substituents at 5-position have also been known. For
example, in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 35, p.944
(1992), there is disclosed that a series of 5-substituted
tetrazole derivatives possess blood glucose lowering
activity. These compounds, however, are not satisfactory
in their activity.US Patent No. 4,845,231 discloses compounds of the
formula:

in which
R is a substituted or unsubstituted monocyclic or
bicyclic alkyl group containing from 3 to 8 ring carbon
atoms, wherein any substituent is alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon
atoms, oxo, hydroxy, carboxy or when the hydroxy and
carboxy substituents taken together they form a 1,3-carbonyloxy
lactone ring closed structure;n is one of the integers 0, 1, 2 or 3;X is ―O―,
 
or ―SO2NH―; andZ is =CH- or -N=;
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are antihyperglycemic
agents.EP-A-0,310,370 discloses compounds having the formula

and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts where
 
each meaning of n is independently 0-5;
each meaning of R2 is independently hydrogen, loweralkyl,
loweralkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro,
cyano or halo; R3 is
W represents a bond or -O-, -S- or
m is 1-15;each meaning of R4 is independently hydrogen or loweralkyl;R5 is loweralkyl, monofluoroloweralkyl, difluoroloweralkyl,
polyfluoroloweralkyl, perfluoroloweralkyl or
R6 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, -COOR4 or

andR7 is hydrogen or methyl.The compounds are useful as anti-allergic and antiinflammatory
agents.A number of prior art references exist which provide
relevant background art and which develop new compounds as
high-affinity leukotriene receptor antagonists.The article by John H. Musser et al, entitled "N-[(Arylmethoxy)phenyl]
Carboxylic Acids, Hydroxamic Acids,
Tetrazoles, and Sulfonyl Carboxamides. Potent Orally
Active Leukotriene D4 Antagonists of Novel Structure", J. 
Med. Chem., 1990, 33, pages 240-245, discloses four series
of N-[(arylmethoxy)phenyl]
