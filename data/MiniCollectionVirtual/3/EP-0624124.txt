<ABSTRACT>
A multi-shaft continuously operating mixing and kneading machine for plasticisable compounds with shafts rotating in a housing which pass through a cylindrical housing section surrounding the shaft concerned and have intake and discharge regions and melting, mixing and kneading regions between them. The intake and discharge regions are formed by inter-engaging worms rotating in the same direction and are arranged in the melting, mixing and kneading regions. The kneading components consist of axially extending polygons (8, 11), the surfaces (27) of which are approximately flat and the edges (25) of which pass the peripheries (29, 30) of the other polygon on rotation with a slight clearance and without engagement. The edges of the housing section surrounding them maintain a substantially greater distance than the clearance.

<CLAIMS>
Multi-shaft continuously operating mixing and kneading 
machine for plasticizable compounds, with shafts (1, 15) 

rotating inside a housing (2), each such shaft passing 
through a cylindrical part (2) of the housing that 

surrounds the shaft concerned and comprising intake and 
discharge zones with melting, mixing and kneading zones 

between them, the intake and discharge zones being formed 
by interengaging worm spirals (7, 17; 14, 24) that rotate 

in the same direction, with kneading elements arranged 
within the melting, mixing and kneading zones, 


characterized in that
 the kneading elements consist of 
axially extended polygons (8, 18; 11, 21) whose surfaces 

(27) are approximately flat and extend essentially parallel 
to the axis and whose edges (25) move past the peripheral 

envelope (29, 30) of the other polygon on rotation without 
interengagement and with a small clearance, the distance 

maintained between the said edges (25) and the surrounding 
part (2) of the housing being substantially greater than 

the said clearance. 
Mixing and kneading machine according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the length of the polygons (8, 18; 
11, 21) is greater than their peripheral diameter (29, 30). 
Mixing and kneading machine according to Claims 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the edges (31) of the polygons (8, 
18; 11, 21) run parallel to the axis. 
Mixing and kneading machine according to Claims 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the edges (25) of the polygons (8, 
18; 11, 21) are inclined at an angle with respect to the 

axial direction of the shaft (1, 15) concerned, the said 
angle being sufficiently small for the said edges to extend 

over only a fraction of one complete pitch.  
 
Mixing and kneading machine according to Claim 4, 

characterized in that
 the inclination of the edges (25) of 
adjacent polygons (8, 18; 11, 21) are in the same direction 

as one another. 
Mixing and kneading machine according to any of Claims 1 to 
5, 
characterized in that
 compressor elements (9, 12) are 
positioned immediately behind the polygons (8, 18; 11. 21). 
Mixing and kneading machine according to Claim 6, 

characterized in that
 the compressor elements (9, 12) 
consist of short worms with a back-feed thread whose turns 

have gaps in them. 
Mixing and kneading machine according to any of Claims 1 to 

7, 
characterized in that
 the cross-section of the polygons 
(8, 18; 11, 21) has the shape of a regular polygon, in 

particular a regular hexagon. 
Mixing and kneading machine according to any of Claims 1 to 
8, 
characterized in that
 the edges (25, 31, 32, 33) of the 
polygons (8, 18; 11, 21) are ground down to strip surfaces 

which are narrow compared with the polygon surfaces (27).
