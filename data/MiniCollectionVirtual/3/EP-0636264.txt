<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sorting coins or the like, which device comprises a body (1), a feeder (2), a coin track (4) having a first support (20), along which the coins (3) can roll supported on their peripheral part, and a second support (21) comprising a drive belt (19), one side surface of the coin facing the second support when rolling and being supported on the first support and the drive belt being arranged to support the coin when the coin rolls along the coin track, and coin ejecting means (6 to 18). In order that the coins and the like can be conveyed at a high speed in such a way that the distance between adjacent coins remains practically the same and no coin jams are caused, the drive belt (19) is arranged to support the coin (3) along only a part of its one peripheral edge in a substantially spotlike manner and the second support (21) comprises a planar support (23) arranged close to the first support (20) for supporting the coin simultaneously at a diametrally opposite point of the peripheral edge, whereby the plane of the drive belt (19) facing the coin forms an acute angle  alpha with respect to the planar support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for sorting 
coins or the like, which device comprises a body, a 
feeder, a coin track having a first support, along 
which the coins can roll supported on their peripheral 
part, and a second support comprising a drive 
belt, one side surface of the coin facing the second 
support when rolling and being supported on the first 
support and the drive belt being arranged to support 
the coin when the coin rolls along the coin track, 
and coin ejecting means, whereby the feeder is intended 
for feeding the coins on the coin track and 
the ejecting means are intended for guiding the coins 
off the coin track to a collecting place desired. The 
invention also relates to a track according to the 
preamble of claim 12. In machines for sorting coins, it is known to 
use quite different types of tracks for displacing 
coins from the feeder to the place where the coins 
are removed from the track. One known device (see DE-A-2 513 240) comprises an inclined track, 
along which the coins can roll by gravity. The coins 
are removed from the track by means of deflecting 
knives, which guide coins of different values into 
separate outlets. The track is not very quick-operated 
(about 600 coins per minute at the most), because 
it does not include means for accelerating the speed 
of the coin movement on the track. A drawback of said 
inclined track is also that it needs relatively much 
space in height direction, due to which the device 
will have a considerable total height. A second known device comprises a track provided 
with a chain arranged to pull coins in the horizontal 
plane to places from where they are removed by  
 
means of solenoid-controlled pins into outlets, each 
coin value having a separate outlet. The chain comprises 
transverse pins at equal distances, which pins 
push the coins forward. The coins are being positioned 
between the pins in such a way that the order follows 
the pattern: pin, coin, pin, coin, etc. Only one 
coin can be positioned between two pins. Thanks to 
the fact that the track is horizontal, the need for 
space in height direction is less than in the previous 
device; however, a problem is that a lifting apparatus 
capable of feeding coins in a synchronized 
manner to the areas between the chain pins must be 
used as a coin feeder. Such a lifting apparatus is 
relatively complicated and feeding coins into the 
recesses of the lifting apparatus does not succeed 
each time, due to which the areas between the chain 
pins are not always filled
