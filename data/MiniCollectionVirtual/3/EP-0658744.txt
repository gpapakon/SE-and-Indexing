<ABSTRACT>
The vibrating gyroscope includes, for example, a 
regular triangular prism-shaped vibrating body. The 

vibrating body is formed with a material which generally 
generates mechanical vibration such as elinver, ceramics. 

The piezoelectric elements are respectively formed to the 
three sidefaces of the vibrating body. An oscillation 

circuit is connected between the two piezoelectric elements 
and the other piezoelectric element. Further, two U-shape 

supporting members made of metal wire are fixed to the 
ridge-line portions of the vicinity of the nodal points of 

the vibrating body. The both ends of the two supporting 
members are fixed to the rectangular-shaped supporting body. 

The supporting body has a cutting portion piercing through 
it from its one surface to the other or a groove portion as 

a suppressing means for suppressing the interference of 
vibrations between the fixing points of the ends of one 

supporting member and those of the other supporting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a vibrating
gyroscope and, more particularly, to the type of vibrating
gyroscope that can be applied for a navigation system
providing an appropriate guidance of a vehicle by detecting
the position of a moving body by sensing its rotational
angular velocity, or to the type of vibrating gyroscope that
can be applied for a damping system such as preventing
device for preventing shaking of hands that suppresses
vibration by detecting an external vibration.FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view showing an
example of a conventional vibrating gyroscope. The
vibrating gyroscope 30 includes a regular triangular prism-shaped
vibrating body 31. The vibrating gyroscope 30 is made
of a constant-elastic metal material such as elinver. On
three side faces of the vibrating body 31, piezoelectric
elements 32a, 32b, 32c are secured respectively by suitable
means such as an adhesive. The piezoelectric elements 32a, 
32b, 32c are made of, for example, by forming electrodes on
both surfaces of a piezoelectric ceramics.An oscillation circuit (not shown) is connected between
the piezoelectric elements 32a, 32b and the piezoelectric
element 32c. By a signal from the oscillation circuit, the
vibrating body 31 bends and vibrates in the direction
perpendicular to the face on which the piezoelectric element
32c is formed. In this situation, when a rotation is applied
around the central axial direction of the vibrating body 31,
the vibration direction of the vibrating body 31 changes by
a Corioli's force, according as a change of the vibration
direction, a difference is generated between output voltages
of the piezoelectric elements 32a and 32b. Thus, a
rotational angular velocity applied to the vibrating
gyroscope 30 can be detected by measuring the difference of
the output voltages.In the vibrating gyroscope 30 constructed as described
above, supporting members 33a and 33b made of metal wire
are mounted on ridge-line portions in the vicinity of the
nodal points of the vibrating body 31. Both ends of the
supporting members 33a and 33b are secured to the
rectangular-shaped supporting bodies 35a and 35b made of
metal material respectively in order to suppress the
propagation and interference of the vibration of the
vibrating body 31. In this arrangement, two holes 36, 36 
are provided on each of the supporting bodies 35a and 35b,
respectively. Both the ends of one supporting members 33a
are inserted into the two holes 36, 36 on the supporting
body 35a and soldered. In the same way, both the ends
