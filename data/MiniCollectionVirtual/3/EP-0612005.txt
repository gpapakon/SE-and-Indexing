<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fluid pressure reducer with cannula and calliper of the type comprising a body (1) having a through bore (11) including a fluid entrance region (13) and exit region (14), and inside which bore extends the cannula which is furnished with a seat (44) for a valve (1). The reducer is characterised in that the cannula (4), when fitted inside the bore (11), is made leaktight on the fluid entrance region (13) side by a seal (8), positional retention being ensured by a locking member (9), and is held back under counterpressure and positioned in angular orientation about the longitudinal axis of the through bore (11) by a snap-fit member (45).

Fluid-pressure reducer with cannula and calliper of the 
type comprising a body (1) including a through bore (11), 

having a fluid inlet zone (13) and a fluid outlet zone (14), 
and in which the cannula (4) extends, and which is provided 

with a seat (44) for a valve (1), a pressure reducer 
characterised in that
 the cannula (4), fixed in the bore 
(11), is sealed therein on the same side as the fluid inlet 

zone (13) by a joint (8), being held in position by a 
locking member (9), and is held there under back-pressure 

and positioned in an angular orientation about the 
longitudinal axis of the through bore (11) by a snapping-in 

member (45) housed in a cavity in the body, on the same side 
as the fluid outlet zone of the latter. 
Fluid-pressure reducer according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cannula (4) has, on the same side 

as the fluid inlet zone (13), a shoulder (48) in which the 
sealing joint (8) is housed. 
Fluid-pressure reducer according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the locking member (9) is a washer 

clamped in the through bore (11) and in contact with the 
joint (8) so as to deform it. 
Fluid-pressure reducer according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the snapping-in member (45) is a lug 

made in one piece with the cannula (4). 
Fluid-pressure reducer according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the snapping-in member (45) is a lug 

produced in one piece integral with the cannula (4). 
Pressure reducer according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cannula (4) has a collar (46) in abutment against a 

shoulder (16) of the through bore (11).
