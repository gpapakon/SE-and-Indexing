<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (8) transfers cargoes (W) between a 
shelf (6) in a rack or the like and a rigid bed (7) disposed 

on a transporter (1) or the like, so that each 
cargo is pushed onto the bed (7) or into the shelf (6). 

The apparatus has a traverser (9) disposed along at 
least one of opposite sides of a transfer path formed 

between the bed (7) and the shelf (6). A first driving 
means (11) causes the traverser (9) to reciprocate 

along the transfer path, between its retracted position 
beside the rigid bed and its extended position in and 

beside the shelf. A pair of transfer arms (10a, 10b) 
pushing the cargo towards and away from the rigid bed (7) 

are respectively secured to a forward and rearward ends 
of the traverser (9) and arranged along the transfer 

path. The apparatus further has a second driving means 
(12) for driving the transfer arms in opposite directions 

between their upright rest position and their laid active 
position located in the transfer path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cargo transfer system for
transferring cargoes between shelves and a transporter.
Such a cargo transfer
system is used to automatically transfer cargoes between a rack
or the like and a transporting apparatus such as an automobile
truck or a stacker crane which are driven on and along rails
and equipped with the apparatus for transferring the cargoes.In a cargo transfer system known from DE-A-39 17 485 the cargo
in the shelves is pulled out towards a bed of a transporter by
use of a hook which is a member separate from a pusher used to
push the cargo from the transporter to the shelves. The pusher
cannot be extended into the shelves because the traverser
interconnected with the pusher is restricted on movement towards
the shelves.The transferring apparatuses of the known kind include also
those of the so-called running fork type adapted to scoop up
the cargoes. The prior art apparatuses further include those of
the grasping conveyor type designed to grip each cargo at its
opposite sides and pull it out of its rest position. Still 
another type of the known apparatus is called the hook-and-pull
type having a member engaging with a hooked portion of each
cargo and pulling it out of its rest position, as mentioned
above. In the first mentioned running fork type, there must be
provided a lower idle space for a running fork to move along a
lower surface of the cargo, in addition to an upper idle space
in which the cargo is lifted by the fork. Consequently, a pair
of left and right pillows have to be fixed on a bottom plate of
each shelf. Further, a prop supporting the pillows must be
erected between the adjacent two shelves, thereby noticeably
reducing the rack's space actually effective to store of the
cargoes.The transferring apparatuses of the grasping conveyor type and
the hook-and-pull type is free from this problem. However, the
grasping conveyor type which should comprise a pair of parallel
unit conveyors to grip the cargoes, is not employable if the
width of cargoes vary beyond tolerable limits. Many mechanisms
are used to longitudinally displace and retract the unit
conveyors in harmony with each other, to rotate them and to
displace them towards and away from each other. Thus, the
structure of the transferring apparatuses of this type is
extremely complicated and needs much more investment in plant.
The hook-and-pull type, which is feasible only if each cargo
has the hooked portion, is of a poor versatility.A primary object of the present invention is therefore
