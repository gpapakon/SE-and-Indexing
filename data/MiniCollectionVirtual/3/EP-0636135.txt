<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONTriazole compoundsThis invention relates to novel triazole compounds, processes for preparing the same, compositions containing the same, as well as, applications of the compounds in the technical fields of herbicides and microbicides.Compounds of various chemical structures having herbicidal or microbicidal action have so far been developed to provide various and particularly selective herbicides and microbicides. Under such circumstances, more emphasis is being put on the protection of environment, and development of such herbicides and microbicides as do not cause environmental disruption neither secondarily nor later is desired.Triazole compounds which have a herbicidal action are generally known. For example, European Patent Application No. 0078 613 describes herbicidally active triazole compounds.First of all, this invention relates to novel compounds represented by formula (1):wherein Rj represents a hydrogen atom or a group A which is a protective group or is C1-C4-al_kyl; X and Yjointly represent a carbonyl group together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, or X and Y each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a -OR2 group, wherein R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an acetyl group, a benzyl group or a silyl group represented by -SiR'3 (wherein R' represents an alkyl group); and Z represents a -CH PO(OR3)2 or -CH2OPO(OR3)2 group (wherein R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a benzyl group, a phenyl group, a cyanoethyl group, an allyl group, a CH2OH group, a COOR5 group, or an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, organic ammonium, trialkylsulphonium, 

 trialkylsulfoxonϊum, phosphonium or amidinium cation; n is 0 or 1; andR5 is a Cj-Cg-alkyl group.This invention includes all of the isomers represented by the following formula of resonance structure:in which R n, X, Y and Z have the meanings as definded in formula (1).The present compound includes two kinds of compounds; one is phosphate compounds and the other phosphonate compounds.Alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl and the various isomeric pentyl or hexyl radicals. The term "lower alkyl group' is preferably methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.The meaning -SiR3 (wherein R' represents an alkyl group) also includes, for example, -Si(CH3)3, Si(C2H5)2CH3 or Si(CH3)2-CH(CH3)3.The compounds represented by formula (1), wherein n is 1 and Z represents -CH2OPO(OR3)2, can be
