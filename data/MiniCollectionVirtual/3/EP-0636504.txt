<ABSTRACT>
An end link for a stabiliser bar of a vehicle 
suspension system has three pre-assembled sub-assemblies 

(38, 40, 42). One sub-assembly (42) includes a bolt (16), 
a washer (38), and a grommet (30), and an opposite end 

sub-assembly (38) includes a grommet (24), a washer (36), 
and a nut (34). An intermediate sub-assembly (40) 

includes a plastic tubular spacer body (52) having opposite 
ends closed by plastic end caps (54, 56) fixed to the 

tubular body (52) by axially projecting fingers or 
abutments (62), which also serve to resist deflection of 

the end caps (54, 56). The intermediate sub-assembly also 
includes grommets (26, 28) fixed to the end caps (54, 56).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an end link for a 
stabiliser bar used in a suspension system for a vehicle, 
such as an automobile or a light truck. Suspension systems of the type contemplated herein 
usually include a stabiliser bar, a control element, and 
an end link connecting an end of the stabiliser bar with 
the control element so as to transmit forces therebetween. 
Such end links have included pairs of grommets respectively 
embracing the stabiliser bar and the control element, a 
connecting rod or bolt extending through such grommets, and 
a spacer mounted on an intermediate portion of the bolt 
between innermost grommets for maintaining a desired space 
between the stabiliser bar and the control element. A suspension system and an end link of the above-described 
type are disclosed in US-A-4,944,523. Among the 
advantages of the end link structure of US-A-4,944,523 was 
the structure which enabled the unit to be arranged in a 
few pre-assembled sub-assemblies, so that installation in 
the suspension on a vehicle production line was greatly 
simplified. In the patent, the intermediate spacer is disclosed as 
a spool formed with a tubular steel body and annular steel 
flanges at its opposite ends. The tubular body is 
disclosed as being formed from a flat piece of steel stock 
with an axial seam. As will be understood, suspension 
systems of vehicles such as automobiles are frequently 
subjected to corrosive elements, such as salt, water, 
snow and the like. Such elements may prematurely corrode 
the normally exposed parts of the end link, such as the 
metal tube and flanges of the intermediate spool, and may 
also enter within the spool and cause corrosion of the 
connecting rod or bolt. According to this invention, an end link for a 
stabiliser bar of a vehicle suspension system, comprises:
 
 
   a rod having a first section of pre-determined 
diameter and a threaded end section, abutment means at an 
end of said rod opposite from said threaded end section;
 
   a non-corrodible plastic, hollow tubular impervious 
body surrounding an intermediate portion of said rod, and 
having an internal diameter substantially larger than said 
pre-determined diameter of the rod;
 
   end caps respectively secured to opposite ends of said 
tubular body, each of said end caps including an annular 
portion closing an end of the tubular body, and having an 
inner diameter greater than said pre-determined said 
diameter of the rod, each of said end caps including an 
annular projection extending from a
