<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of optically active carboxylic acids and 
the esters thereof. More particularly this invention relates to the preparation of 
aliphatic carboxylic acids and the esters thereof by first forming the diastereomeric 
salts of such materials and then separating the diastereomeric salts. Resolution of racemic aryl-substituted aliphatic carboxylic acids has been 
described in the literature. Kaiser et al., J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 65, No. 2, 269-273 
(February 1976) formed the S(-)α-methylbenzylamine salt of S( + )-ibuprofen, removed 
it from the reaction mixture by filtration and recrystallized it from isopropanol and 
then from methanol. After acidifying with 3N aqueous sulfuric acid and extracting 
with ether, S( + )-ibuprofen was obtained, m.p. 50-52 ° ,[α]D + 57 · with 95% optical purity 
as determined by GLC analysis. Cox et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., Vol. 232, No. 
3, 636-643 (March 1985), using Kaiser et al.'s method, were able to obtain an S( + )-ibuprofen 
preparation which was 99% S-isomer and 1% R-isomer (w/w). Other methods of separating the enantiomers of racemates can be effected by 
preparing a salt of the acid with an alkaloid or similar resolving agent such as 
cinchonidine, then separating the products by fractional crystallization from a solvent 
in which the salt of the dextrorotatory isomer is least soluble. The ( + )-salt can then 
be acid cleaved to yield pure enantiomer. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,638, 
issued June 24, 1980, U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,767, issued January 25, 1972, which relates 
to resolution of naproxen and related compounds. U. S. Pat. No. 5,015,764 discloses a process for separation of diastereomers of 
certain aliphatic carboxylic acid by first treating a solution of such carboxylic acids 
with a base and then adding a chiral organic nitrogenous base having a base strength 
no greater than the organic or inorganic base. One of the enantiomeric salts resulting 
from the reaction is less soluble in the reaction solution than the other. It precipitates 
and is separated. In all of the aforementioned examples, an inert solvent is added to facilitate 
the reaction.  
 According to the present invention, there is provided a process for increasing 
the amount of the desired enantiomer obtained from a racemic mixture of 
linear or branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof in the absence of any 
additional solvent. The process comprises: 
i) heating a solid racemic mixture of said aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester
