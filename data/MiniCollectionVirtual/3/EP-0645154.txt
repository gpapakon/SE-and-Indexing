<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel cartridge-needle 
unit having a retractable needle for use with disposable 

or reusable holders to form safety syringes. 
The cartridge-needle unit comprises a 
cartridge (10) comprising a hollow body (14), a 

septum (18) at the distal end of the body (14), 
means (16) for retaining the septum (18), and a 

plunger (20), axially and reciprocally slidable through 
the interior of the body (14); a needle (22) capable of 

being retracted within the cartridge (10); a hub (24) 
comprising a sleeve (26) adapted to be snapped on the 

distal end of the cartridge (10); means (28,30,32) for 
retaining the needle (22) within the hub (24) during an 

injection; and means (28,30) for releasing the 
needle (22) from the hub (24) after the injection 

comprising an element (30) attached to the needle (22), 
and having a diameter greater than said needle, capable 

of passing through the septum (18). 
The retractable cartridge-needle unit exhibits 
improved reliability, reduces the tendency for body 

fluids and/or medication to remain in an unprotected 
area upon retraction of the needle and virtually 

eliminates the possibility that the needle can be 
released into the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cartridge-needle unit
having a needle that can retract within the cartridge
after use for safe disposal and to a safety syringe
assembly comprising such cartridge-needle unit.Disposable medicament-containing cartridge needle
units for use in conjunction with reusable hypodermic
syringe holders are well known in the art and in
widespread commercial use. Such cartridges
conventionally feature a cylindrical body closed at the
proximal end with a flexible plunger slidable within the
bore of the cartridge and closed at the distal necked-down
end with a septum secured to the cartridge by a
crimped-on aluminum collar. The necked-down distal end
conventionally is fitted with a needle hub/needle/needle
sheath assembly. Such cartridge-needle units are
available from Sanofi Winthrop Pharmaceuticals under the
Carpuject® trademark.In use, the cartridge-needle unit must be
activated, i.e. the proximal end of the needle cannula
must penetrate the sealed septum such that communication
is achieved between the fluid and the proximal end of
the needle. Some cartridge-needle units are sold in an
activated form. Others must be activated by the user.
When user-activated cartridge-needle units are used in
conjunction with conventional reusable syringe holders
of the type described, e.g. in Hadtke, U.S. Patent
4,585,445 and in EP-A-0 485,028, this is accomplished
when the health care worker advances the cartridge
through the holder by rotating a clamping element.Many holders, including the above-referenced
reusable holders, enable the user to avoid handling the
cartridge-needle unit when the needle unit is exposed.
Nevertheless, health care workers are especially
susceptible to accidental and potentially infectious, 
and indeed, on occasion, possibly fatal, needle strikes
due to the careless handling and/or disposing of the
cartridge-needle unit after use. The consequences to
health care workers of strikes from needles contaminated
with various infectious diseases such as hepatitis or
AIDS can be particularly severe. The frequency of
accidental needle strikes in the United States is
surprisingly great, and has been estimated to be
approximately one million strikes per year. Moreover,
the cost to health care organizations for the testing of
health care workers accidentally stricken by used
needles is a significant burden on health care costs.
This is illustrated in a recent report by Kirkland,

World, August 1993, pp.20-24, which states:
   "The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cartridge-needle unit comprising:

a cartridge (10) comprising:

a hollow body (14),
a septum (18) at the distal end of said
body (14),
means (16) for retaining the septum (18),
and
a plunger (20), axially and reciprocally slidable
through the interior of said body (14);
a needle (22) capable of being retracted
within said cartridge (10);
a hub (24) comprising:

a sleeve (26) adapted to be snapped on the
distal end of said cartridge (10),
means (28,30,32,38) for retaining said needle
(22) within the hub (24) during an injection; and
means (28,30,32) for releasing the needle
(22) from the hub (24) after the injection

characterized in that said means (28,30,32) for
releasing the needle (22) from the hub (24) and

said means for retaining the needle (22) within

the hub (24) comprise an element (30) of greater
diameter than said needle and attached thereto,

said element abutting against a hub post (32)
before and during injection and being capable of

passing through the septum, said hub post being
capable of forcing the element through the septum

after injection and said element (30) being
adapted to separate from the remaining needle retaining

means, with a continued application of an axially
and distally directed force on the plunger (20),

the needle thus embedding into the plunger.
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in
claim 1 wherein said means for releasing the

needle (22) from the hub (24) comprises a washer
(28) and a dart (30) attached to said needle (22),

wherein said dart (30) is capable of passing
through said septum (18). 
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in claim 2
wherein said dart (30) is frangibly connected to said

washer (28).
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 3 wherein said hub (24) comprises a fluid

well (36).
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 4 wherein said means for retaining the

septum (18) comprises an aluminum cap (16).
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 5 wherein said plunger (20) comprises a

stud (42).
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in either
of claims 2 and 3 wherein said hub (24) comprises a post

(32) capable of forcing said dart (30) through said
septum (18).
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in either
of claims 2 and 3 wherein said dart (30) is fabricated of

a brightly colored plastic.
A cartridge-needle unit as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 8 further comprising means for tilting the

needle (22) comprising a non-compliant member.
A syringe assembly comprising the cartridge-needle
unit of claim 1 and a holder therefor.
An assembly as claimed in claim 10 wherein
said holder is a disposable holder.
An assembly as claimed in either of claims 10
and 11 wherein said holder comprises a cap sized to

prevent the plunger (20) and needle (22) from being
pulled out of the cartridge (10).
An assembly as claimed in claim 12, wherein
said holder comprises a holder body and a connecting

member between said cap and said holder body.
An assembly as claimed in claim 13 wherein
said connecting member comprises a foldable tether (46).
