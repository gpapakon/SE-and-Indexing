<ABSTRACT>
A cutting head for a cord-type mower driven by an engine (3) 
is disclosed. The cutting head includes a rotor capable of 

rotating about an axis and a bobbin (8) with a cord (11) wound on it. 
The bobbin can rotate relatively to the rotor about the axis in 

the rotor. The cutting head includes two types of cord feeding 
systems. The first cord feeding system automatically feeds a 

cord in response to cord wear. The second cord feeding system 
feeds a cord in response to a manual tapping operation executed 

during driving of the cutting head. The second cord feeding 
system disconnects one of the bobbin and rotor from the engine 

in response to the tapping operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No. 2-312500 filed on November 16, 1990 which is 
incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates generally to a cutting head 
for a cord type mower. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a cord feeding system for extending a cord wound on 
a bobbin in a rotary casing to a length necessary for mowing. Many conventional cord type mowers have systems in their 
cutting heads for feeding new cord when the current cord length 
is insufficient. Also, manual-type cutting heads are known 
which permit manual extension of the cord wound on a bobbin. At present, the so called tap-and-go type and automatic 
type cutting heads are popular. For the tap-and-go type, the 
cord is fed the required length by releasing an interlock 
between a bobbin and a rotary casing. The interlock is released 
either by hitting or strongly pressing the rotary casing 
against the ground. This type of cutting head is disclosed in, 
for example, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 2-16595, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-26922, US Patent No. 4161820, 
US Patent No. 4183138, and US Patent No. 4189833. For the automatic type, the interlock between the bobbin 
and rotary casing is released by the centrifugal force which 
changes according to the length of the cord that extends from 
the rotary casing. Thus, the desired cord length can be 
maintained. This type of cutting head is disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-22484, Japanese 
Patent Laid-open No. 60-83508, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 
63-79522, Japanese Patent Laid-open No, 2-163003, US Patent No. 
4347666, US Patent No. 4607431, US Patent No. 4660286, and us 
Patent No. 4817288. For the tap-and-go type, it is necessary for the operator  
 
to frequently check the length of the cord consumed during 
mowing and extend the cord by hitting the rotary casing against 
the ground at times or strongly pressing it. Otherwise, the 
mowing efficiency greatly decreases. Therefore, the operator 
always has to execute checking and hitting. The checking and 
hitting give a large mental burden and physical load to the 
operator. However, the tap-and-go type has the advantage that the 
operator can freely set the cord length according to the state 
of the material (such as grass) being cut. For example, when 
grass is soft, it is possible to improve the operation 
efficiency by extending the cord length which permits to the 
cutter to mow at a faster rate. When grass

A cutting head for a cord-type mower having a motor 
or engine (3) for driving the cutting head, comprising: 

   A casing (4) rotated by the motor (3) about an axis; 
   a bobbin (8) mounted in the casing (4) such that it can 

rotate relative to the casing (4) about the axis and slide 
along the axis relative to the casing (4); 

   a cord (11) wound about the bobbin (8); 
   a cord feed slot (10) provided on the outer periphery of 

the casing (4) for permitting the distal end of the cord (11) 
to extend outside the casing (4) to a position that is suitable 

for cutting; and 
   first cord feeding means (78, 79 etc) for reciprocating 

the bobbin (8) along the axis to feed a predetermined length of 
the cord (11) through the cord feed slot (10), in response to 

a tapping operation that is executed while the cutting head is 
being driven, 

   said cutting head being characterised by further 
comprising: 

   said bobbin (8) having an upper flange (75) and a lower 
flange (77); and 

   second cord feeding means for automatically feeding the 
cord 911) in response to cord wear, the second cord feeding 

means being capable of automatically selectively disengaging 
the bobbin (8) from the casing (4) in accordance with the 

rotational speed of the casing (4) which varies as a function 
of the length of the cord (11) extended from the cord feed slot 

(10), in order to feed a predetermined length of the cord (11) 
through the cord feed slot (10), wherein said second cord 

feeding means comprising: 
   a plurality of teeth (75a-75h, 77a-77h) provided on the 

outer surfaces of said upper flange (75) and lower flange (77); 
and 

   a swing lever (80) for controlling relative rotation 
between said bobbin (8) and said casing (4), said swing lever 

(80) having a first arm (81) capable of engaging the teeth 
(75a-75h) provided on said upper flange (75) and a second arm 

(82) capable of engaging the teeth (77a-77h) provided on said
