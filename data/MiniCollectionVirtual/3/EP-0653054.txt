<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for balancing the grinding wheel (2) of a grinding machine, comprises an assembly coupled to and rotating with the wheel and including masses (24, 26) the position of which is adjustable and electrical motors (28, 30) to control adjusting movements of the masses. The electrical connection between the motors and a survey and processing unit (16) including a power source (40) is provided by slip rings (48) and brushes (54). The brushes are fixed to a movable support (52). A spring (58) acts on the movable support to space the brushes apart from the slip rings. Operative means including, for example, electromagnets (60) acts on the movable support to perform the contact between the brushes and the corresponding slip rings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an apparatus for 
dynamically balancing a rotating body, with a supporting 
frame, an assembly fixed to and rotating with said body, 
comprising masses the position of which is adjustable, and 
at least one electrical motor connected to the masses and 
adapted to adjust said position, power supply and control 
means adapted to feed and control said at least one 
electrical motor, and spaced apart from the rotating body, 
and electrical connection means between the power supply 
and control means and said at least one electrical motor, 
with mutually slipping contacts comprising first contact 
elements and second contact elements that are connected to 
one and to the other of the rotating body and the 
supporting frame. In particular, the invention refers to a balancing 
apparatus for dynamically balancing the grinding wheel of a 
grinding machine. Unwanted vibrations are generally present in a grinding 
machine, and are generated by out of balance conditions of 
the grinding wheel due to various possible reasons such as: 
shape and/or constitution defects (parallelism errors 
between the faces of the wheel, concentricity errors 
between the external abrading surface and the internal 
centering hole, inhomogeneity of the material, porosities, 
etc.), inaccurate assembling to the rotating spindle 
(causing the wheel center of gravity being spaced apart 
from the rotation axis), and, in general, deteriorations 
due to wear and!or splinter during the machining operations  
 
of the workpieces. The vibrations may cause inaccuracies in 
the machined workpieces such as roundness errors (ovality, 
lobing), and introduce loads and stresses that may damage 
the machine tool. Known balancing apparatuses are coupled to the grinding 
wheel and comprise movable masses, that are driven by 
electrical motors, during the rotation of the wheel, along 
radial or angular paths, in order to compensate the out of 
balance. The driving motors are part of the apparatus, rotate along 
with it and along with the wheel, and are fed by a fixed 
external power source, through an electrical coupling 
including, for example, slip rings and brushes. The vibration caused by the out of balance is picked up by 
a sensor, and some parameters of the vibration (frequency, 
amplitude, and/or other ones) are valued, and then are 
displayed and/or processed in a unit that also comprises 
the above mentioned power source. The unit may then send 
proper "balancing" signals to the motors, in order to 
properly
