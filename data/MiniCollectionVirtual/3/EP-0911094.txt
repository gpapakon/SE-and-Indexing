<ABSTRACT>
The assembly to position rectangular metal plate (3) on a conveyor (5) has a leading movement section where the plates (3) lie on the conveyor (5), held by magnets (23). At the next movement stretch, a mechanism (27,33) slides and orients the plates (3) to be carried to the final section where the conveyor (5) carries the aligned plates (3) to a workstation (35). The plate alignment station has a recirculating steel belt (27) with at least one magnet (33) at the side.

A device for positioning rectangular sheet [metal] blanks (3) lying on a transport means

(5) with a revolving, driven transport belt (7), comprising

a first transport section (A), in which the sheet [metal] blanks (3) may be

transported on the transport means (5) in a non-aligned manner,
a second transport section (B), on which the sheet [metal] blanks (3) on the

transport means (5) may be displaced and aligned and
a third transport section (C) on which the sheet [metal] blanks (3) in the exactly

aligned position created in the second transport section (B) may be led to a
processing station (35),
characterised in that

in the third transport section (C) below the transport belt (7) there is arranged at least one magnet
(21) for attracting and for the friction-fit holding of the sheet [metal]
 blanks (3) conveyed on the
transport belt (7), and that a magnet element (33) is arranged laterally of the second transport

section (B), for attracting the sheet [metal] blanks (3) to an aligning means.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a belt face of a belt (27) revolving
parallel to the movement direction (P) of the transport belt (7) is arranged in front of the magnet

element (33) as an aligning means.
A device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the sheet [metal] blanks (3) in a first

transport section (A) are protected against a displacement on the transport means (5) by way of a
magnet (21) arranged below the transport belt (7).
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the magnets (21)
below the transport sections (A, C) at the ends projecting towards the middle of the transport

device have a reducing attraction force.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the ends of the magnets (21) are
tapered.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the magnets (21) in this region lie
inclined to the transport belt (7).
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 in the third transport
section (C), a transport belt (43) which is arranged above the upper belt face (17) of the transport

belt (7) and which revolves in a synchronous manner is guided in a friction fit pressable manner.
