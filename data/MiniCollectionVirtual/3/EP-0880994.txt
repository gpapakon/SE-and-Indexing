<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing a granular material from a liquid starting material in a workable state includes coaxial drums (1,7) located one inside the other which are coupled to a mechanism to drive them at different speeds about their common axis. The drums have openings (2,8) in their cylindrical walls for the starting material, which solidifies after passing through the openings to solid granules. The arrangement includes a feed opening (14) through which the starting material is introduced into the drums. Preferably the openings (2,8) in the walls of the drums may be uniformly distributed or, seen in the direction of the common axis of the drums, several rows of adjacent openings may be provided in the inner or outer drums. The openings in the wall of the inner drum are slots whose axes are parallel to that of the drum, whilst those in the outer drum (1) may be radial drillings or slots with axes parallel to that of the drum. The openings in the (8) in the wall of the inner drum are wider in the circumferential direction then those in the outer drum. Radially extending blades (13) are provided on the outside of the wall of the outer drum. A heating device (12) is provided for the inner drum. A hollow shaft (3,9) extends from one of the ends of each drum respectively and is connected to the drive mechanism. The outer drum is supported by an extension (3) in a bearing housing (6).
