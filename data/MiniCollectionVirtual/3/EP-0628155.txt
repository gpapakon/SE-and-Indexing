<CLAIMS>
A circuit arrangement for a transmitter, in particular 
for an acceleration transmitter, having a differential 

measuring sensor (1) of low capacitance for conditioning 
the measured signals of the differential measuring sensor 

(1) to give a transmissible signal at the output (13) of 
the circuit arrangement, characterized by the combination 


a. of two coupled RC oscillators (6) and (9) and (5) and 
(8) respectively, in each case the one oscillator 

being arranged in the feedback loop of the other 
oscillator and the capacitance of these oscillators in 

each case being formed by one of the two capacitance 
elements of the differential measuring sensor (1), 
b. with two bistable multivibrators (10) and (11) each 
connecting the two oscillators to one another, one of 

the two multivibrators (10) additionally bringing 
about a level inversion, 
c. and with a downstream gate (12) for an exclusive OR 
link of the two signal portions e1 and e2 applied 

across the outputs of the multivibrators (10) and 
(11), with the result that a logical double pulse 

signal (14) corresponding to the measuring variable is 
provided at the output (13) of the gate (12). 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the bistable multivibrators are in 

the form of Schmitt triggers. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the bistable multivibrators, for the 

purpose of evaluation of very small capacitances which is 
largely free from disruption, have very high input 

resistances.
