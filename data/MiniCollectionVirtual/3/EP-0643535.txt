<ABSTRACT>
A time-varying image coding device for coding 
time-varying image signals and a time-varying decoding 

device for decoding time-varying image signals. The 
image signals of high resolution are thinned by means 

of a spatial filtering with a given resolution in such a 
way that the aspect ratio is different, so as to generate 

image signals of low resolution. Predicted image signals 
of image signals of high resolution are generated by 

means of a spatial filtering with a given resolution so 
that the aspect ratio of the signals generated by decoding 

decoded signals of the image signals of low resolution 
is equal to the original one. The image signals of high 

resolution are coded by use of the predicted image signals 
thus generated. The time-varying image decoding device 

generates predicted image signals of image signals of 
high resolution by means of a spatial filtering with a 

given resolution in such a way that the aspect ratio of the 
decoded signals obtained by decoding the coded signals 

of image signals of low resolution is equal to the original 
one, and generates the image signal of high resolution 

by predictively decoding the coded signals by use of the 
predicted image signals thus generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to picture signal coding and decoding. The invention
can be used in the case of recording a moving picture signal onto a recording
medium, e.g., a magneto-optical disc or a magnetic tape, etc. to reproduce the
recorded moving picture signal to display it on a display, etc., or in the case of
transmitting a moving picture signal from the transmitting side to the receiving side
to display it, etc. in television conference systems, television telephone systems, or
broadcasting equipments etc.A coding method and a decoding method in which coding in a hierarchial form
(hereinafter simply referred to as hierarchical coding) is not applied will be first
described, and a coding procedure in the case where hierarchical coding is carried out
will be then described.For example, in systems for transmitting a moving picture signal to remote
place, e.g., in television conference system, or television telephone system, etc., a
picture signal is coded 
in a compressed manner by making use of the line correlation or
interframe correlation between video signals for the purpose of
efficiently utilizing transmission path.In the case of utilizing the line correlation, a picture
signal can be compressed by allowing it to undergo, e.g., DCT
(Discrete Cosine Transform) processing, etc.Moreover, when the interframe correlation is utilized, a
picture signal can be coded in a further compressed manner. For
example, when frame pictures PC1, PC2, PC3 are assumed to
respectively take place at times t=t1, t2, t3 as indicated by A
of FIG. 22, a difference between picture signals of frame
pictures PC1 and PC2 is calculated to generate picture PC12 as
indicated by B of FIG. 22. Moreover, a difference between frame
pictures PC2 and PC3 of A of FIG. 22 is calculated to generate
picture PC23 of B of FIG. 22. Since pictures of frames adjacent
in point of time ordinarily have not so great change, when a
difference therebetween is calculated, its difference signal
takes a small value. Namely, in picture PC12 designated at B of
FIG. 22, a signal of the portion indicated by slanting lines in
the figure of picture PC12 of B of FIG. 22 is obtained as a
difference between picture signals of frame pictures PC1 and PC2
of A of FIG. 22. In addition, in picture PC23 designated at B
of FIG. 22, a signal of the portion indicated by slanting lines
in the figure of picture PC23 of B of FIG. 22 is obtained as a
difference between picture signals of frame pictures PC2 and PC3
of A of FIG. 22. In view of this, if this difference signal
