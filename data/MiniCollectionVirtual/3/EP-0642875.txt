<ABSTRACT>
Prodn. of bottles (1) - which comprise at least a top cover (2) and a container body (3) in the form of a hoop (4) with or without a bottom (5) - is characterised by the following facts: (a) the periphery (7) of the cover (2) is pre-formed to fit into the top edge (10) of the hoop (4) so that the gap between them is at most equal to 2/10 of the thickness of (11) of the cover material; (b) the joint (12) between the periphery (7) and the edge (10) is produced by laser welding. The appts. includes a laser torch provided with means for positioning and displacing it relative to the assemble bottle elements. The bottle, in particular, for liquefied gas is characterised by the presence of a gripping/holding element (23) and a seating (22) for upright storage.

Process for manufacturing and assembling bottles, viz. liquified gas 
bottles, according to which upon designing of at least a cover (2) and a container 

(3) in the shape of a shell (4) pre-fitted or not with a bottom (5) the peripheral 
edge (7) of the cover (2) is so pre-shaped that it can be superposed, at 

the outer or inner side, on the upper edge (10) of the shell (4) and the clearance 
left between same is at most equal to 2/10ths of the thickness (11) of the 

walls which they are comprised of and upon applying of a corrosion-proof 
protection coating through metallization on this cover (2) and this container 

(3) a penetrating laser welding is carried out between the peripheral edge (7) of 
said cover (2) and the upper edge (10) of the shell (4), this through relative displacement 

of the welding seam (12) in front of a laser torch (14). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the peripheral edge 
(17) of the bottom (5) is so pre-shaped with a view to be superposed on the 

lower edge (18) of the shell (4) that the clearance left between same is at most 
equal to 2/10ths of the thickness (11) of the walls which they are comprised of 

and that upon applying of a corrosion-proof protection coating through metallization 
a penetrating laser welding is carried out between the peripheral 

edge (17) of the bottom (5) and the lower edge (18) of the shell (4), this through 
relative displacement of the welding seam (19) in front of a laser torch (14). 
Process according to any of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that between 
the peripheral edge (7) of the cover (2) and the upper edge (10) of the 

shell (4) and/or the peripheral edge (17) of the bottom (5) and the lower edge 
(18) of said shell (4) is left a clearance which, before welding, is at most equal 

to 1/10th of the thickness (11) of the walls this cover (2), the shell (4) and said 
bottom (5) are comprised of. 
Installation allowing the implementation of the process according to 
any of claims 1 to 3, including a laser torch (14) provided, on the one hand, 

with means for taking reference (15) on the bottle (1) to be assembled through 
welding with a view to ensure its maintaining at a distance and in a constant 

position with respect to the welding seam (12, 19) and, on the other hand, 
means (16) for maintaining these means for taking reference (15) applied 

against said bottle (1), the installation being completed with means for controlling 
the bottle (1) in rotation with a view to cause said welding seam (12, 

19) to progress in front of said laser torch (14).
