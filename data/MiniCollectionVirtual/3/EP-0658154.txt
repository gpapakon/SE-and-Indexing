<ABSTRACT>
A process for the dehydrogenation of a hydrocarbon and/or oxygenated hydrocarbon feed, which process comprises the steps of (a) sequentially contacting the feed with a catalyst bed in a reaction chamber at elevated temperature, said catalyst bed comprising a first catalyst which is a dehydrogenation catalyst to produce a dehydrogenated product and hydrogen and a second catalyst capable of adsorbing and/or reacting with at least some of said hydrogen, said second catalyst having a porous coating; (b) removing the dehydrogenated product and any hydrogen which has not been adsorbed or reacted from the reaction chamber; (c) removing at least some of the adsorbed/reacted hydrogen from the coated catalyst and/or oxidising at least some of the reduced coated catalyst, thereby regenerating the second catalyst; (d) using said regenerated second catalyst in step (a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
dehydrogenation of a hydrocarbon feed.Dehydrogenation processes, and in particular dehydrogenation of
alkanes, are well known and employ a suitable dehydrogenation
catalyst. In general, the feedstock is contacted with the catalyst
to provide the dehydrogenated product and hydrogen. The hydrogen may
then be separated from the product stream to provide the desired
product.EP-A-0543535 discloses a process for the dehydrogenation of a
hydrocarbon feed which comprises contacting the feed with a
dehydrogenation catalyst, optionally mixed with a catalyst for
adsorbing or reacting with the hydrogen. Whilst the process of this
European patent application provides good selectivities to the
dehydrogenated product, it has been found that a proportion of the
product is oxidised.We have now found that the aforementioned problem may be
overcome and selectivities to dehydrogenated products can be
considerably improved by the presence of a special form of the second
catalyst in the catalyst bed. Accordingly the present invention
provides a process for the dehydrogenation of a hydrocarbon
feed, which process comprises the steps of
(a) sequentially contacting the feed with a catalyst bed in a
reaction chamber at elevated temperature, said catalyst bed
comprising a first catalyst which is a dehydrogenation catalyst
to produce a dehydrogenated product and hydrogen and a second 
catalyst capable of adsorbing and/or reacting with at least
some of said hydrogen, said second catalyst having a porous
coating.(b) removing the dehydrogenated product and any hydrogen which has
not been adsorbed or reacted from the reaction chamber;(c) removing at least some of the adsorbed/reacted hydrogen from
the coated catalyst and/or oxidising at least some of the
reduced coated catalyst, thereby regenerating the second
catalyst;(d) using said regenerated catalyst in step (a)The present invention provides a process for the
dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons wherein
the dehydrogenation step and the hydrogen removal and subsequent
steps are separated. The presence of a porous coating results in a
preferential reaction of the hydrogen with the coated catalyst.
Furthermore, the presence of a porous coating round the catalyst
allows selective reaction of the catalyst with hydrogen, whilst
preventing reaction with the dehydrogenated product. Consequently,
further reactions of the dehydrogenated product is prevented, thus
providing high yields. Additionally, the regeneration of the
catalyst is unaffected
