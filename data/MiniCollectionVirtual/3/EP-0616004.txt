<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel, porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a process for the preparation thereof. Both the PTFE and the process are distinguished by the fact that polytetrafluoroethylene is degraded radiation-chemically, the degraded polytetrafluoroethylene is mixed with a high-molecular-weight emulsion polymer, and the mixture is extruded, stretched and optionally sintered.
