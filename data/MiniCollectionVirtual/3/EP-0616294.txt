<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for reading binary data which are stored on the magnetic track of a magnetic storage card in the form of flux changes using the two-frequency code, in which a relative movement between the magnetic storage card and an electromagnetic transducer is generated, the transducer emitting a voltage (U) induced by a change of magnetic flux. The extreme values (54-66) of the voltage (U) are determined, and the occurrence of the extreme values (54-66) in relation to a clock time (T) defined by means of the two-frequency code is evaluated for obtaining data. Proceeding from an extreme value (58) used for obtaining data, the time intervals (T1-T4) of successive extreme values (60-66) are measured and added. The extreme value (66) at which the sum (S) corresponds approximately to the clock time (T) is evaluated for obtaining data.
