<ABSTRACT>
A vaporizable cooling medium, suitably pentane, is used in a 
gas conversion process, for example a Fischer-Tropsch process, to 

consume and be vaporized by the exothermic heat of reaction. The 
thus vaporized medium may then be expanded to produce energy, for 

example to drive an air plant compressor to produce oxygen for use in 
the gas conversion process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an inert, condensible 
medium, for removing heat from hydrocarbon synthesis reactions, for 
example a Fischer-Tropsch process. Fischer-Tropsch processes invariably use water/steam as the 
cooling medium for this exothermic process. Thus, boiling water is 
pumped through cooling tubes in the reactor. As the reaction proceeds 
and heat is generated, it is absorbed by the water converting it to 
steam and thereby using the latent heat of vaporization to control 
reactor temperatures. Fischer-Tropsch reactions, particularly on a 
commercial scale, require many, many cooling tubes, whether for fixed 
bed or slurry operations, for maintaining proper temperatures. Thus, 
the risk of a tube failure or weld leak is compounded significantly. 
In the event of a tube leak, the contents of the reactor are normally 
at a higher pressure than a boiling water/steam coolant and reactor 
contents will leak into the cooling system resulting in severe contamination 
and ultimately shut down of the process. While steam/water 
cannot be pressurized to greater pressures than the reaction process, 
because the temperature would be too high, even if it could, a leak of 
steam into the process will tend to deactivate the Fischer-Tropsch 
catalyst.  
 US-A-2 238 766 discloses a Fischer-Tropsch type process 
employing water as coolant. The process is carried out such that the 
reaction pressure corresponds to the vapour pressure of the water 
coolant at the reaction temperature. CH-A-275 423 also discloses a Fischer-Tropsch type process. 
The coolant employed is a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons, 
especially C10 to C14 when reaction temperatures of 250 to 300°C are 
envisaged. Finally, DE-A-28 34 589 is a further example of a Fischer-Tropsch 
type process. In this case the coolant is both water and 
steam. This forms superheated steam which is then converted to 
another form of energy, for example in a turbo-generator. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a 
method for removing heat from a hydrocarbon synthesis process reaction 
zone, which comprises passing a cooling medium through the reaction 
zone, in indirect heat exchange therewith, thereby vaporizing the 
cooling medium; the cooling medium being inert with respect to the 
relevant hydrocarbon synthesis process, condensible and at a pressure 
greater than the pressure in the reaction zone and being selected from 
C4-C10 normal, iso, and cyclic paraffins, olefins, low molecular 
weight silanes, silyl ethers and
