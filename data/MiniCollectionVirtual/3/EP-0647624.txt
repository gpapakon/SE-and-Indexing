Novel intermediates for the preparation of 
vitamin A and carotenoids, characterized in that they 

correspond to formula (II) below: 

 
   in which A represents hydrogen or an alkyl, 

alkenyl or alkoxy unit containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
Process for the preparation of the intermediates 
according to claim 1, characterized in that an acetylene 

derivative of formula (III) below: 

 
in which the group R represents a linear or branched 

alkenyl unit containing 2 to 15 carbon atoms or an 
alkylcarbonyl, alkoxyalkyl or alkoxyalkenyl group each 

containing 2 to 15 carbon atoms, is heat-treated. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the alkenyl units are chosen from the following 

units: 

Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the alkylcarbonyl units are chosen from the units:  

 

 
where R' represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 

carbon atoms. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the alkoxyalkyl or alkoxyalkenyl units are chosen 

from the following units: 

 
where R' represents an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 

carbon atoms or a group: 

Process for the preparation of the intermediates 
according to claim 1, characterized in that ethynyl 

retro-α-ionol is condensed with a 2-alkoxypropene in the 
presence of an acid. 
Intermediates for the preparation of compounds 
according to claim 1, characterized in that they 

correspond to formula (III) below: 


 
in which R represents hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 

to 10 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 2 to 10 
carbon atoms, alkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, alkoxyalkyl 

or alkoxyalkenyl in which the alkyl groups have 1 to 10 
carbon atoms and the alkenyl groups have 2 to 10 carbon 

atoms, it being possible for these alkyl or alkenyl units 
to be linear or branched and optionally substituted. 
Intermediate according to claim 7, characterized 
in that R represents hydrogen. 
Process for the preparation of an intermediate of  
 

formula (III) in which R does not represent hydrogen, 
characterized in that ethynyl retro-α-ionol is reacted 

with an enol ether or an acetal containing 3 to 10 carbon 
atoms or an alkyl acetoacetate containing 4 to 10 carbon 

atoms or a trialkyl orthoacetate containing 5 to 10 
carbon atoms or diketene optionally in the presence of an 

acid catalyst. 
Process for the preparation of an intermediate of 
formula (III) in which R represents hydrogen, characterized 

in that, in a first step, β-ionone is placed in 
contact with an alkoxide and, in a second step, the 

compound obtained in the first step is placed in contact 
with acetylene in the presence of a base. 
Process for the preparation of retinal, characterized 
in that the derivative of formula (II) in which 

A represents a methyl group is treated with hydrobromic 
acid.
