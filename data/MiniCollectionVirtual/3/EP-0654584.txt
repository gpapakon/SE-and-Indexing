<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydrostatic radial piston machine with two rotors (17, 18) which are mounted to allow easy rotation on a spindle and which have a plurality of radially extending holes with displacer elements (piston plus sliding block 15, 14) sliding on the inside of a cam ring (8, 9). For control of the delivery of the pressure medium, the holes are connected via control slots (21, 22) to delivery passages (high-/low-pressure 27, 28) opening at the sides of the rotors. The invention is characterised in that the two rotors (17, 18) are mounted in an easily rotatable manner on a spindle (43) installed rigidly in an intermediate plate (5), in that the intermediate plate (5) is situated between the rotors (17, 18), in that thrust washers (37, 44) which accept the axial forces caused by the pressure medium in the control slots (21, 22) of the rotors (17, 18) are mounted on the ends of the spindle (43), and in that the cam rings (8, 9) are mounted in the intermediate plate by way of a common connecting shaft (10).

Hydrostatic radial piston machine with two rotors (18,
19) mounted on a shaft member (43) to be easily

rotatable, said rotors having a plurality of radially
extending holes (16, 17) with displacer elements sliding

on the inside of a lifting ring (8, 9, 109, 208),

whereby the holes (16, 17) are connected to delivery
channels opening laterally on the rotors for control of

the delivery of the pressure medium via control slots
(21, 22);
the two rotors (18, 19) are mounted on a shaft member
(43) firmly installed in an intermediate base (5, 205,

305, 405) so as to be easily rotatable;
the intermediate base (5, 205, 305, 405) lies between
the rotors (18, 19);
thrust washers (37, 44), which absorb the axial forces
caused by the pressure medium in the control slots (21,

22) of the rotors (18, 19), are attached to the ends of
the shaft member (43);
the lifting rings (8, 9, 109, 208) are mounted in the
intermediate base (5, 205, 305, 405) via a joint

connecting shaft (10).
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1, characterised
in that a collar (33, 34), against which the thrust

washers (37, 44) are clamped, is provided on the shaft
member (43) for each rotor (18, 19), so that the

distance between the thrust washers (37, 44) and the
intermediate base (5, 205, 305, 405) or the control

discs (25, 26) is slightly greater than that 
corresponding to the width of the rotor (18, 19).
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that both displacer volumes may be

varied via a joint control system.
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1 or 2 for set up
of a compact gear in secondary regulated construction,

characterised in that the pressure sides of both rotors
are connected to one another and the low-pressure sides

of both rotors are separated.
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that for the set up of pumps or motors

with different operating pressures and, in the case of
motors, different rotational speeds, characterised in

that the two low-pressure sides are connected to one
another and the high-pressure sides are separated.
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that each rotor (18, 19) has its own

high- and low-pressure connection.
Hydrostatic machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the two rotors (18, 19) have

different displacer volumes.
