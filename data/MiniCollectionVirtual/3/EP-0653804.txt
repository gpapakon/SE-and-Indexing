<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector 
(10)
 provides for the termination of discrete 
insulated conductors 
(18)
 of a multi-conductor cable. The connector 
includes an insulative connector housing 
(20)
 supporting plural 
electrical contacts 
(44)
 having insulation displacing contact 
portions. A conductor holding block 
(80)
 is movably supported by the 
housing with respect to the insulation displacing contact 

portions. The conductor holding block includes contact slots 
(82)
 for 
receipt of the insulation displacing contact portions. The 

conductor holding block further includes passages 
(84)
 in 
communication with the contact slots for receipt of the 

conductors. The conductor holding block is movable between a 
conductor receiving position and a conductor termination 

position. The conductor holding block is continuously supported 
by the connector housing so as to define a conductor support 

position to temporarily support the conductors against the 
insulation displacing contact portions without effecting 

conductor termination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improvements in
electrical data connectors. More particularly the present
invention relates to a shielded compact data connector which
permits reliable termination of a multi-conductor electrical
cable.In the field of data/communications technology, information in
the form of electrical signals is being transmitted at ever
increasing speeds. Along with the desire to transmit information
at faster data rates, the industry has also seen the need to
reduce the size of hardware employed so as to increase
portability and ease of use. In order to keep pace with these
improvements, the interconnection technology, which includes
electrical cables and electrical connectors designed to connect
such hardware, has also undergone significant changes.
Electrical connectors and cables are now available which are much
smaller in size and capable of transmitting data at higher rates.Continued improvement in connection technology is not without
problems. When decreasing the size of electrical connectors
while requiring the connectors to transmit data at higher rates,
cross-talk between adjacent conductive components of the
connector becomes a factor which must be addressed.
Additionally, as these components are normally used in close
proximity to other electronic components, the individual
connector components must be shielded from electro-magnetic
interferences and radio-frequency interferences. These
interferences can adversely affect the performance levels of the
connectors especially at higher data rates.An additional demand on connector technology is that the
connector components must be "user friendly". That is, the 
components must be easy to assemble as well as easy to
connect and disconnect. Further, the portability of many
electronic components requires that these connections and
disconnections be repeated many times. A connector must be
able to withstand the rigors of repeated interconnection
without degradation of mechanical or electrical performance.
In addition, as these connectors are manufactured to be
field installable, the connector must permit simple and
reliable termination of a multi-conductor electrical cable
by the installer.It can be appreciated that merely "downsizing" a connector
will be insufficient to meet the current requirements of the
industry. Smaller connectors must be designed to meet
increased signal transmission requirements, and provide for
internal and external shielding as well as long term
reliable mechanical performance.DE-U-9310211 shows

An electrical connector (10) for terminating discrete
insulated electrical conductors (18) of a multi-conductor

cable (12) comprising:

an electrically insulative connector housing (20);
plural electrical contacts (44) supported in said
housing, said contacts having insulation displacing contact

portions (52) for effecting insulation displacing electrical
connection with said conductors;
a conductor holding block (80;80') having plural
conductor receiving passages (84;84') for individually

accommodating said conductors and plural contact slots
(82;82') in individual communication with said conductor

receiving passages for accommodating said insulation
displacing contact portions;
said holding block (80;80') being movably supported
by said housing (20) for movement from a conductor receiving

position permitting unrestricted, insertion of said
conductors (18) into said passages (84, 84') to a termination position

wherein said insulation displacing electrical connection is
effected; and
said holding block (80;80') and said housing (20)
including cooperative securement elements (90,92;90,92',99)

for supporting said holding block with respect to said
housing (20) in a plurality of intermediate positions between

said conductor receiving position and said termination
position, each intermediate position defining a temporary

conductor support position for retentively supporting said
conductors of a corresponding size against said insulation

displacing contact portions (52) without effecting said
insulation displacing connection.
An electrical connector of claim 1, wherein said
cooperative securement elements (90,92;90',92) define

multiple discrete positions in which said holding block
(80;80') is supported with respect to said housing including

said conductor receiving position and said termination
position. 
An electrical connector of claim 2, wherein said
cooperative securement elements (90,92; 90',92') further

support said holding block (80;80') with respect to said
housing in plural intermediate positions including:


a first intermediate position for accommodating
conductors of a given size; and
a second intermediate position for accommodating
conductors of a size different from said given size.--

frictionally support said holding block (80') with respect
to said housing at continuous positions between said

conductor receiving position and said termination position,
said continuous positions defining said temporary conductor

support positions.
