<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a cutlery piece, particularly for 
babies and small children, which emits a rewarding signal after food intake 
therefrom. Small children are often reluctant to eat, especially in the first 
stages of spoon-feeding. Parents take great effort in the form of singing, 
speaking or story telling in order to convince the child to eat. Rewarding signals such as melody or flashing lights are very 
useful in educating children to perform desired tasks. Thus, for example, in 
order to educate children to ease themselves into potties, such potties 
comprising an electronic device in which moisture closes an electrical circuit 
which activates music or a flash of light are used, and after performing the 
desired task, the child receives such a rewarding signal. It would have been highly desirable to provide a cutlery piece 
such as a spoon or the like which is capable of providing the child with a  
 
rewarding signal upon emptying the food therefrom, thus turning feeding 
into a joyful event. The present invention provides a cutlery piece, such as a 
spoon or the like, comprising a food holding portion and a handle, 
characterized in that said cutlery piece has electronic means capable of 
providing a transient audio or visual output signal when one or both of the 
faces of the food holding portion are exposed to light after a period of no 
light exposure (hereinafter at times, "darkness"). Said output signal is preferably one which is pleasing to small 
children and it can be an audio output signal such as music, synthesised 
words and the like; or a visual signal such as flashing lights, coloured lights 
and the like. Said electronic means is capable of transiently activating an 
audio or visual output signal upon exposure of said sensor to light after a 
period of darkness. It comprises a light sensor and a signal generating 
means, which latter comprises a battery, an electronic control and activation 
element (hereinafter at times, "control element") and an output element such 
as a miniature loud speaker, one or more light emitting diode etc. The 
capability to activate an output signal upon exposure to light after a period 
of darkness may rest in the properties of the sensor, i.e. the sensor 
desensitizes after a prolonged exposure to light and resensitizes only after 
a period of darkness; or alternatively this capability may rest in the 
properties of the control element. Such control elements which are capable 
of giving a transient electric output signal upon receipt of
