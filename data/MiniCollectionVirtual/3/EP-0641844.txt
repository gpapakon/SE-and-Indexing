<ABSTRACT>
Distortion control additives are disclosed which comprise a 
polyisocyanate, a polyol or polyol blend, and an acrylate or 

methacrylate. The distortion control additives can provide 
substantial reductions in distortion, e.g., shrinkage, of objects 

produced by ultraviolet curing, e.g., stereolithography, of coating 
compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ultraviolet-curable liquid 
compositions, such as, for example, those used in stereolithograpic 
curing processes, and more particularly, to distortion control 
additives for use in such ultraviolet-curable liquid compositions. Stereolithography is a technology whereby three-dimensional 
objects, e.g. models, can be formed using computer guided ultraviolet 
light, such as that from a laser beam, to solidify superposed layers of 
a liquid ultraviolet-curable composition. Typically, a support is 
positioned beneath the surface of a reservoir containing the 
ultraviolet-curable composition. As each successive cross-sectional 
layer of the object being polymerized is formed, the liquid level is 
raised or the support is lowered and another layer is formed until the 
entire three-dimensional object is formed within the liquid reservoir. 
The geometry and dimensions of each cross-sectional layer are 
determined by a computer model which controls the positioning of 
the ultraviolet light. It is not uncommon for levels of distortion, e.g., shrinkage, of 
objects made by stereolithography to range from about 10 to 30 
percent. Typical problems which can arise from such distortion 
include, for example, warpage of flexible substrates, loss of 
adhesion, crazing of a coating, and the like. Since ultraviolet-cured 
objects made by stereolithography are often used as dimensionally 
accurate models for setting up mass production processes, the 
minimization of distortion is extremely important. Additives such as acrylates and methacrylates have been 
proposed for use in ultraviolet-curable liquid compositions in order to  
 
reduce distortion of objects made therefrom. However, further 
improvements are needed. Thus, new distortion control additives for 
ultraviolet-curable liquid compositions are desired which can impart 
improved distortion control properties . U.S. Patent No. 4,634,602 relates to compositions having utility 
as primers for coil coatings which comprise a radiation sensitive 
compound having ethylenic unsaturation and at least one moiety 
selected from the group consisting of a urea moiety, a urethane moiety 
and mixtures thereof, a radiation insensitive compound having a 
number average molecular weight of at least about 400 comprising at 
least about 40 percent, by weight, based on the weight of the radiation 
insensitive compound, of aromatic ring moieties and having a hydroxyl 
equivalant weight of between about 200 and 1600 and a crosslinking 
agent reactive
