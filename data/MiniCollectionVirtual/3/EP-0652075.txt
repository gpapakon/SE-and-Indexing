<ABSTRACT>
The device has a tool column (3) of natural stone which is designed as a portal and is mounted on a work table (2) of the same material by means of an air-bearing fixture (4) in order to displace the tool column, the air-bearing fixture being arranged in the portal. A vacuum-clamping fixture (6) is formed in the work table in order to hold the workpiece to be machined on the surface of the work table. A first means (7) for feeding the bearing fixture (4) and a second means (8) for producing the clamping force are arranged in the frame. A control means (9) is intended to control the device according to a predetermined program. By means of the device, with high material-removal rates, material with three-dimensional contours or free-form surfaces or thin-walled parts can be machined with high accuracy and high feed rates.

<CLAIMS>
A device for machining workpieces, which comprises
a stand (1), a tool pillar (3) constructed as a

gantry, which is displaceable in the X-axis, a
machining device (5), which has a feed arrangement

to move the machining device in the y and x axis, a
tool holder having a clamping device (6) to hold the

workpiece to be machined and with a control device
(9) to control the device according to a

predetermined program,
characterised in that
 the workpiece holder is a
cuboid-shaped workbench (2) attached to the stand

(1),
in that
 the tool pillar (3) is displaceably disposed
on the workbench (2),
in that
 the tool pillar (3) and/or the workbench (2)
are made from natural stone or plastic material,
in that
 a fluid bearing device (4) is provided in
the gantry stand of the tool pillar (3) to store the

tool pillar on the workbench,
in that
 the machining device (5) with the feed
arrangement is disposed in the support (12) of the

tool pillar (3),
in that
 the clamping device (6) is provided in the
workbench in order to retain the workpiece to be

machined on the surface of the workbench
and in that
 a first device (7) for feeding the fluid
bearing device (4) and a second device (8) for

producing the clamping device are disposed in the
stand (1). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the workbench (2) and/or the
tool pillar(3) has a single-part or multi-part

construction.
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bearing device (4) is an
aerostatic bearing or a hydrostatic bearing.
