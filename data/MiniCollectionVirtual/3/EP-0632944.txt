Process for transmitting or storing digitized multi-channel audio signals, whereby on
the encoder side


a) each audio signal is represented digitally by a number of spectral part-band
signals,

giving digital scan values that are discrete in time;
b) digitization of the scan values in the individual part-bands is modified (coded)

according to the inter-channel monitoring threshold of the human ear in terms of irrelevance
reduction;
c) for each part-band signal, a scale factor (SCF) is determined, which classifies the peak
value of the part-band signal within a given time interval (block) and is used to scale the part-band

signal before digitizing;
d) for control of digitization of the scan values of each part-band
signal, bit assignment

information (BAL) is obtained by audio signal analysis, which is stored or transmitted
together with the determined scale factors (SCF) and coded part-band

signals;

and on the decoder side:
e) the coded part-band signals are decoded according to the bit assignment information
(BAL) and the part-band signal level is unscaled according to the scale factors (SCF);
f) the de-coded and unscaled part-band signals of each audio channel are combined to
form a wide-band digital audio signal;
characterised in that
g) on the encoder side, the part-band signals of different audio channels but the same 
frequency position are combined between channels according to a dynamic control signal

(COS), derived from several audio channels by audio signal analysis set on a binaural, psycho-acoustic
model, and
h) on the decoder side, the part-band signals of different audio channels but the same
frequency position are de-combined between channels depending on an actuating variable

(COM), which is derived from the dynamic control signal (COS) and transmitted or stored at
the same time.
Process as per claim 1, 
characterised in that
 on the encoder side, by means of the
control signal (COS) and/or bit assignment information (BAL), the part-band

signals are set at
zero, whereby the scan values of the relevant part-band signals are not transmitted or stored,

and on the decoder side the scan values not transmitted or stored in the part-bands
are

replaced by transmitted or stored scan values in the part-bands of other audio channels of the
same frequency position according to the actuating variable (COM), whereby the replaced

scan values are adapted in terms of level to the original level conditions.
Process as per claim 2, 
characterised in that
 for level adaptation, weighting factors
(GEW) are determined from the scale factors (SCF), for weighting the substituted scan values.
Process as per claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 zero-settingting
depends on

determination of a sequence of one transient and one static signal status on the same audio
channel or adjacent audio channel.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
of the part-bands

of higher frequency positions is more frequent than in the part-bands
of lower frequency

positions.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
is more

frequent in those part-bands in which the signal energy is relatively low in relation to the 
signal energy of the overall audio signal.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
takes place

using the inertial effect of the human ear.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
takes place

using the psycho-acoustic masking of adjacent audio channels.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
takes place

using redundancy in part-bands of the same frequency position of adjacent audio channels,
whereby on the decoder side, on re-combination, the zero-set part-band

signals are substituted
in their original audio channel only.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
only takes place

when alias distortion detected on the encoder side is irrelevant in terms of the properties of the
human ear.
Process as per one of claims 2 to 10, 
characterised in that
 zero-setting
ceases if there

is a negative correlation between part-band signals of the same frequency position.
Process for transmitting or storing digitized multi-channel audio signals, whereby on
the encoder side


a) the audio signal of each audio signal is represented digitally by a number of spectral
part-band signals, giving digital scan values that are discrete in time;
b) digitization of the scan values in the individual part-bands is modified (coded)
according to the inter-channel monitoring threshold of the human ear in terms of irrelevance

reduction;
c) for each part-band signal, a scale factor (SCF) is determined, which classifies the peak 
value of the part-band signal within a given time interval (block) and is used to scale the part-band

signal before digitizing;
d) for control of digitization of the scan values of each part-band
signal, bit assignment

information (BAL) is obtained by audio signal analysis, which is stored or transmitted
together with the determined scale factors (SCF) and coded part-band

signals;

and on the decoder side:
e) the coded part-band signals are decoded according to the bit assignment information
(BAL) and the part-band signal level is unscaled according to the scale factors (SCF);
f) the de-coded and unscaled part-band signals of each audio channel are combined to
form a wide-band digital audio signal;
characterised in that
 in the case of stereophonic

intercorrelation of audio channels (Lo, Ro, C, L, S, R, S) on the encoder side, digitization of
the part-band signals of the stereophonically intercorrelated audio channels is based on control

information (BAL) from a common monitoring threshold, whereby the common monitoring
threshold is formed from the individual monitoring thresholds of all the audio channels

concerned, and that on the decoder side, de-digitization of the part-band
signals of the

stereophonically intercorrelated audio channels is based on the control information (BAL),
which is transmitted or stored at the same time.
Process as per claim 12, 
characterised in that
 the common monitoring threshold is
calculated taking into account the masking difference on stereophonic reproduction.

 on the encoder side, the part-band signals of different audio channels
but with the same frequency position are combined between channels dependent on the sound

representation format of the audio channels selected according to the system configuration,
and that on the decoder side, the part-band signals of different audio channels of the same

frequency position are de-combined between channels dependent on a control signal (CFG),
which is derived from the selected sound representation format and transmitted or stored at

the same time.
