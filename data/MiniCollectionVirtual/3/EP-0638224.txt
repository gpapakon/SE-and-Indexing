<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-calibrating
tomosynthetic, radiographic-imaging
system, method, and device and, more particularly, to
a calibrated radiographic-imaging device for use as
part of a self-calibrating tomosynthetic X-ray system
and method in which random relative positional
geometries between the source of radiation and the
radiographic imager affixed to the object of interest
may be utilized for recording radiographic images for
tomosynthesis.Diagnostic performance obtainable from
radiographic systems is limited necessarily by
sampling constraints which preclude uniform access to
dynamic processes manifested in the three spatial
dimensions as well as time. Conventionally,
improvements in diagnostic performance have been
effected by manipulation of the temporal limitations
through immobilization of the object of diagnostic
interest.When temporal limitations are ignored,
diagnostic performance can be enhanced through an
increase in the range and number of x-ray projections
produced. Early conventional bases for optimizing
diagnostic performance simply involved taking multiple
transmission radiographs from projection angles judged
to be appropriate for the diagnostic task. When
anatomical constraints precluded access to unambiguous 
single-projection geometries, supplemental approaches
were developed involving the use of linear, circular,
and hypercycloidal tomography.A more recent improvement over conventional
tomography is tomosynthesis. The primary advantage
afforded by tomosynthesis over conventional tomography
resides in the fact that tomosynthesis enables any
number of tomographic slices to be reconstructed from
a single scanning sequence of x-ray exposures.
However, one of the drawbacks with the practical
implementation of conventional tomosynthetic systems
has been that acquisition of all tomosynthetic
projections must be made with little or no movement of
the irradiated tissues or objects. Only by
immobilizing the object of interest is it presently
possible to establish the known geometric
relationships required for conventional tomosynthetic
reconstruction systems.The advent of modern computerized tomography
has greatly improved diagnostic performance of
conventional tomography and tomosynthesis by
facilitating access to tissue or object details
visible only through 2- or 3-dimensional sampling in a
way that eliminates tomographic blur. However, even
computerized tomography has significant shortcomings,
particularly for tasks requiring high spatial
resolution or the need to
