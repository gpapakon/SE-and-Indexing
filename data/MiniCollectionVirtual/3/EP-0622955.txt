<ABSTRACT>
An image scanning device comprises a light source for 
emitting a beam, a CCD circuit board having a CCD sensor, an 

optical unit for guiding the emitted beam from the light source 
to the CCD sensor, a CCD sensor driving circuit connected with 

the CCD circuit board with a signal cable, a clock generating 
circuit for generating a clock to be transferred to the CCD 

sensor, a reset pulse generating circuit for generating a reset 
pulse for resetting an output buffer of the CCD sensor, a clamp 

circuit for clamping an output of the CCD sensor, and an 
analog-to-digital converter for converting an analog signal 

into a digital signal. The clock generating circuit is disposed 
on the CCD circuit board. The reset pulse generating circuit is 

disposed on the CCD circuit board. The CCD sensor driving 
circuit comprises a fast clock generator for feeding clocks to 

a CCD element at fast speed and a voltage attenuator for 
attenuating a voltage of the fast clocks. The optical unit 

includes a light condensing means for condensing the beam 
emitted from the light source to a front point of the light 

source, the light source irradiating the beam on a manuscript 
surface. The image scanning device further comprises an 

actuating means for actuating the reset means and the clamp 
means one time for a plurality of outputs of the CCD sensor, a 

first latch means for latching an output of the analog-to-digital 
converter, a second latch means for latching for 

latching an output of the first latch means, and a subtracting  
 

means for subtracting the output of the second latch means from 
the output of the first latch means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image scanning device
arranged to use a one-dimensional CCD sensor.Recently, an image scanning device has been widely used as
means for inputting a text or a graphic data to a computer or
inputting a data to a digital copier or a facsimile.The image scanning device is arranged to apply an intense
beam from a light source to a manuscript surface to be read and
to form on an image sensor the beam reflected from the
manuscript surface as an image through the effect of an optical
system. The image sensor operates to photoelectrically convert
the reflected beam into a voltage level proportional to
intensity of the reflected beam, concretely, tone of the
manuscript in a pixel-by-pixel manner for reading an image. The
read analog signal is amplified and converted into a digital
signal through the effect of an analog-to-digital converter.
Then, the converted digital signal is transferred to the
system.The image sensor, in general, is a one-dimensional CCD
sensor having pixels arranged on one line. Fig. 15 is a general schematic view showing a scanning
device.A scanning device 10 comprises a glass table 12 on which a
manuscript sheet 11 is to be placed, a light source 13 located
under the glass table 12, an optical unit 14 having a mounting
board 15 for mounting a CCD sensor 20, a mounting board 16 for
mounting an analog processing circuit and a control circuit, a
signal cable 21 connecting both of the mounting boards 15 and
16 with each other, and a cabinet 22. The optical unit 14 is
provided with a mirror 18, a lens 19, a CCD sensor (CCD
element) 20, and the mounting board 15. In addition, a numeral
17 denotes a pulse motor for moving the optical unit 14. The
light source 13 performs a way of condensing light as shown in
Fig. 16.In Figs. 15 and 16, during the scan, the beam emitted from
the light source 13 passes through the glass table 12 to a
manuscript sheet 11. The beam reflected on the manuscript sheet
11, again, passes through the glass table 12 and then is
reflected on the mirror 18. The beam reflected on the mirror 18
is condensed through the lens 19 and then is applied to a
light-receptacle surface of the CCD sensor 20.Fig. 17 is a block diagram showing the CCD sensor used in
the scanning device. S1, S2,..., SN denote photodiodes, each
serving as a light receptor. AS1, AS2,..., ASN each denote an
analog shift register (CCD) for shifting out an analog output
of the light receptor. TGATE denotes a transfer gate for 
transferring an analog output of the light receptor
