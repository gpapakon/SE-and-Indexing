Digital multichannel transmission method, in particular a COFDM 
method, which operates in frame-oriented manner and wherein the frame 

contains at least one zero symbol, characterised thereby, that data are 
transmitted in at least one zero symbol. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the data 
transmitted in the zero symbol are radiated with sufficiently weak 

transmission power that the coarse synchronisation of the COFDM 

receiver is not impaired by the analog envelope curve evaluation. 
Method according to the claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby, that 
the COFDM modulation method is used for the transmission of the data in 

the zero symbol. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the zero symbol is transmitted with a symbol duration 

differing from that of the data signal blocks and, for constant 
bandwidth, the subchannel spacing in the zero symbol and thereby the 

number of the subchannels in the zero symbol differs from the number of 
the subchannels in the data signal blocks. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the data 
of the zero symbol are transmitted with a symbol duration of 80% of the 

data symbol duration, that the data in the zero symbol are transmitted 
with an active symbol duration which amounts to half of the normal 

active symbol duration, that the subchannel spacing in the zero symbol 
is doubled by comparison with that of the normal data symbol blocks and 

that the number of the subchannels is halved. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that a fast 
discrete Fourier transformation (FFT) is computed for the modulation 

and demodulation of the data signal blocks and that an FFT, which has 
half the length of the FFT in the data signal blocks, is computed for 

the modulation and demodulation of the data in the zero symbol.  
 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the data on the individual subchannels are transmitted in 

the phase difference of adjacent subchannels. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 6, 
characterised thereby, that the data on the individual subchannels are 

transmitted in the phase difference between the subchannel of the zero 
symbol and the corresponding subchannel of the next following phase 

reference symbol.
