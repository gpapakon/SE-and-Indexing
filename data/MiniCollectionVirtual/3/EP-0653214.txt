<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a topical antibacterial 
preparation for the treatment of infected hands and for 

the advancement of their healing. Said preparation 
comprises silver sulfadiazine (SSD) and collagen, i
n 
which the ratio of W/W of collagen to SSD ranges from 4 

parts collagen to 1 part SSD, to 200 parts collagen to 1 
part SSD. The concentration of the SSD is preferably 

0.5% to 2.5%, advantageously 1%.
 

The collagen is advantageously native collagen, which may 
be acid soluble or insoluble, or mixtures thereof.

 
The preparation may comprise an inert excipient, e.g. 

Si0₂, or blood plasma components, peptides, carbohydrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a topical antibacterial
preparation for the treatment of infected wounds and for the
enhancement of their healing.Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) preparations are among the best
topical antibacterial agents in clinical use for the treatment of
infected wounds, especially of burns. However, because SSD is
water-insoluble, its most commonly known preparations consist of
dispersions with water-soluble cream bases containing, inter alia,
emulsifying substances that not only do not contribute to the
healing process but frequently even hinder it. Moreover, said
known preparation cannot be used in a dry form. Finally the amount
of SSD required in said emulsions as suggested by various manufacturers
is about 318 - 530 mg in an area of 10 x 10 cm in a 3-5
mm layer. These large amounts of SSD may cause systemic absorption
and damage to the wound tissue.From EP-A-140 596 there is known a
porous complex of a biodegradable fibrous protein, e.g. collagen,
with a polyanionic plant, polysaccharide. S.S.D. may be incorporated
into the wound contact layer. It should be stressed that
there is concerned a complex and not a simple mixture and/or
compound which requires the presence of a special polysaccharide.
Said polysaccharide gives special properties to the complex which
are described and claimed.Collagen is the major connective tissue structural protein
with a variety of biological properties that are intimately
involved in all the phases of tissue repair processes following
injury. The collagen molecule has several hydrophobic domains
along its long polypeptide chains which are suitable for hydrophobic 
interactions with other hydrophobic molecules, such as silver
sulfadiazine.It has been found that by interacting collagen with SSD one
has no need to use emulsifying agents, thus obtaining an active
antibacterial preparation which also enhances the healing process
at the same time.From US-A-4 581 028 is known an infection-resistant
device which is a vascular graft prosthesis for use
within the interior of a human or animal body which may comprise
collagen and SSD. However, said device cannot be used as a topical
preparation. However, the amount of SSD utilised cannot be
calculated.From US-A-4 599 226 is known a method for
preparing animal tissues for use as burn or wound dressings
comprising, inter alia, SSD. It is assumed that collagen may be
present in the skin tissue utilised. However, nothing can be
learned about a topical preparation comprising collagen and SSD.From DE-A-3 523 023 A1 is
