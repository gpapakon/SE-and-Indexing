<ABSTRACT>
A cascadable circuit with a limiter amplifier stage which has two emitter-coupled first transistors (1, 2) which are fed from a common first current source (3), are in each case terminated by a load (5, 6) and are driven by mutually inverse input signals (12, 13), and with a field strength detector stage which has two emitter-coupled second transistors (21, 22) which are fed from a second current source (23) and the circuit of which is in each case closed by the input circuit of a current mirror (27 to 30; 31 to 34), the base of one of the two second transistors (21) being connected to the coupled emitters of the first transistors (1, 2), a reference potential (26) being applied to the base of the other transistor (22) and the output circuit of one of the two current mirrors (27 to 30) being connected in parallel with the input circuit of the other current mirror (31 to 34) carrying the output signal. In this arrangement, first and second transistors (1, 2; 21, 22) are of the opposite type of conduction and the input circuit of the current mirror (31 to 34) carrying the output signal terminates that of the second transistors (22), to the base of which the reference potential (26) is applied.
