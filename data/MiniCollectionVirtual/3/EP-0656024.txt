<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing powdered paints in which a mixture of: A) a binder consisting of an epoxy-group-containing synthetic resin or a mixture of such resins; and B) a cross-linking agent consisting of a compound which, on a statistical mean, contains at least two carboxyl groups and an least one acid anhydride group per molecule or a mixture of such compounds; are homogenised in the molten state and the homogenised melt thus obtained is powdered after cooling and setting. In the invention, to the mixture of A) and B) is added before or during the molten homogenisation process: C) a polyol or a mixture of polyols in such a quantity that there are 0.1 to 0.9 hydroxyl groups of component C) per acid anhydride group.

Process for the preparation of powder coatings, in 
which a mixture of 


A) a binder comprising an epoxide group-containing 
synthetic resin or a mixture of epoxide group-containing 

synthetic resins, and 
B) a crosslinking agent comprising a compound which 
contains on statistical average at least two carboxyl 

groups and at least one acid anhydride group per 
molecule, or a mixture of such compounds, 
 
is homogenized in the molten state and the resulting 

homogenized melt, after having cooled and solidified, is 
powdered, characterized in that the mixture of A) and B) 

is admixed before or during the melt homogenization 
process with
 
    

C) a polyol or a mixture of polyols 
in such an amount that from 0.1 to 0.9 hydroxyl groups of 

component C) are present per acid anhydride group of 
component B). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that component A) is an epoxide group-containing 

polyacrylate resin. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that component B) is polymeric anhydrides of dicarboxylic 

acids having from 3 to 20, preferably from 6 to  
 

12 carbon atoms in the molecule, or mixtures of such 
polymeric anhydrides. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that component B) is polymeric anhydrides of aliphatic or 

cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that component B) is poly(adipic anhydride), poly(azeleic 

anhydride), poly(sebacic anhydride) or poly(dodecanedioic 
anhydride), or a mixture of these polymeric anhydrides. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that component C) is hexanediol, 

2,2-dimethylolpropionic acid, trimethylolpropane or 
pentaerythritol, or a mixture of these polyols, preferably 

trimethylolpropane. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that component C) is added in an amount 

such that from 0.3 to 0.6 hydroxyl groups of component C) 
are present per acid anhydride group of component B).
