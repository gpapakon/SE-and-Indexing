<ABSTRACT>
A hot air dryer (10) utilizes high velocity air 
jets which scrub and break up the moist air layer which 

clings to the surface of a freshly printed sheet (S). High 
velocity air is heated to a high temperature as it flows 

along a resistance heating element (38) within an air 
delivery baffle tube (64). The heated, high velocity air 

pressurizes a plenum chamber (46) within an air distribution 
manifold (36W). High velocity jets of hot air are 

discharged through multiple airflow apertures (54) onto the 
wet ink side of a printed sheet as it moves through a dryer 

exposure zone (Z). An extractor (40) removes the moist air 
layer, high velocity hot air and volatiles from the printed 

sheet (S) and from the press (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to accessories
for sheet-fed, rotary offset and flexographic printing
presses, and in particular to a dryer for printed materials
which utilizes high velocity, hot air flow and extraction.In the operation of a rotary offset press, an
image is reproduced on a web or sheet of paper or some
other printable substrate by a plate cylinder which carries
the image, a blanket cylinder which has an ink transfer
surface for receiving the inked image, and an impression
cylinder which presses the paper against the blanket
cylinder so that the inked image is transferred to the
paper. In some applications, a protective and/or decorative
coating is applied to the surface of the freshly
printed sheets. The freshly printed sheets are then
transported to a sheet delivery stacker in which the
printed sheets are collected and stacked.The relatively wet condition of the printing ink
composition and its solvent and/or diluent components and
a layer of moisture laden air which clings to the surface
of the freshly printed web or sheet may interfere with the
quality of the images as they are printed at each succeeding
printing unit. For example, the quality of colored
images, half-tone illustrations and the like undergo
degradation in the uniformity of their appearance and color
because of the presence of the wet ink, volatiles, and 
moisture within the printed substrate. Moreover, protective
coatings will undergo dilution and surface degradation
causing a dull finish if the underlying substrate is not
dried sufficiently before the coating is applied.Such defects, including uneven surface appearance
of protective/decorative coatings, detract from the
appearance of the underlying images or photographs,
particularly in the case of multi-colored images or
photographs. The defects are caused by residual volatile
solvents, diluents, water and the like within the oleoresinous
inks of the images, and the presence of moisture
in the printed material, at the time that the next successive
image is printed or the protective/decorative coating
is applied. Because the defects are compounded as the
printed material moves through successive printing units,
it is desirable that curing and drying be initiated and
volatiles and moisture laden air be extracted at each
interstation position, as well as at the delivery position.Hot air dryers and radiant heaters have been used
as delivery dryers and as interstation dryers. Interstation
dryers employing radiant heat lamps are best suited
for slow to moderate press
