<ABSTRACT>
A filter cartridge (2) within a housing (1) consists of a cylindrical filter insert (3) and securing flange (4) joined to the end (5) of the filter insert (3). The flange (4) can be pressed against the enclosed surrounding surface (7) of the housing (1). The flange (4) can be positioned within a thrust ring (6) to form a seal against the housing (1), the thrust ring (6) has a depression (10) on its inner circumference to form a back taper (11), the flange (4) fits the depression (10) from which it may be removed, and the back taper (11) incorporates a spring-retractable projection (12) which fits the flange (4) depression.

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge filter arrangement, comprising a
housing (1) with a cartridge filter (2) capable of being

fixed therein, with a filter insert (3) of essentially
cylindrical shape, and a holding flange (4) which is

connected to the end (5) of the filter insert (3), the
holding flange (4) being capable of being inserted into

a supporting ring (6) and being capable of being pressed
onto the housing by the supporting ring (6) along a

circumferential surface (7) closed on itself, the supporting
ring being provided with a recess (10) which runs

round the inner circumference and which forms an undercut
(11), and the holding flange (4) being capable of being

inserted releasably into the recess (10), characterized
in that the undercut (11) comprises at least one spring-in

projection (12), and in that the projection (12) can
be brought into engagement with a depression of the

holding flange (4), the said depression being arranged on
the outer circumference.
A cartridge filter arrangement according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the holding flange (4) is

provided with at least one elastically compressible first
sealing lip (8) on the side facing the housing (1).
A cartridge filter arrangement according to
either of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the

holding flange (4) is provided with at least one
elastically compressible second sealing lip (9) on the

side facing away from the housing (1).
A cartridge filter arrangement according to any
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the depression of 

the holding flange (4) is designed to run round in the
form of a groove.
A cartridge filter arrangement according to any
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the housing (1)

is provided, in the region of the outer circumference of
the supporting ring (6), with at least two holding bosses

(13, 14, 15), in that the supporting ring (6) is provided
with recesses (16, 17, 18) assigned to the holding bosses

(13, 14, 15) and open circumferentially in the same
direction of rotation, and in that the holding bosses

(13, 14, 15) can be brought into engagement with the
recesses (16, 17, 18) as a result of relative rotation of

the supporting ring (6).
