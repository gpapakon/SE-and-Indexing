<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions for inhibiting or 
preventing the skin irritating or sensitizing effects 

of a skin irritating or sensitizing component of a 
dermal or transdermal drug delivery system are 

disclosed. The composition comprises a mast cell 
degranulating agent which is capable of inducing a 

state of immunological tolerance to the skin 
sensitizing agent by delivery prior to, or at the 

onset of transdermal drug delivery. Such an agent, 
preferably 
cis
-urocanic acid or an analogue or 
metabolite thereof, can be administered before, 

during or after each transdermal drug delivery to 
achieve immune tolerance countersensitization. 

Alternatively, the agent can be used to induce 
countersensitization. The agent is preferably 

capable of permeating the epidermis and is 
administered transdermally. Novel methods and 

compositions comprising 
cis
-urocanic acid or an 
analogue or metabolite thereof to obtain anti-inflammatory 

effects are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention in the field of drug 
delivery relates to 
intervention in skin immune responses to prevent or 
inhibit contact sensitization 
reactions caused by various therapeutic drugs 
delivered transdermally. This is 
achieved by local treatment of the area of the skin 
receiving the drug with a tolerizing or counter-sensitizing 
agent having mast cell degranulating 
activity, such as cis-urocanic acid, or an analogue 
or derivative thereof. The transdermal route of parenteral delivery 
of drugs provides many advantages over alternate 
routes of administration. Transdermal delivery 
systems (TDS) for delivery of drugs or other 
beneficial agents are well-known (see, for example, 
U.S. Patents # 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 4,286,592, 
4,314,557, 4,379,454, 4,559,222 and 4,573,995,). A TDS is 
generally composed of the following components: (a) 
"basic components," including backing, matrix  
 
reservoir, and an optional separate adhesive layer; 
(b)the drug; (c) "additives," including solubilizers, 
plasticizers and penetration enhancers; and (d) 
"impurities" such as residual amounts of monomers, 
initiators, cross-linkers, etc., from the 
polymerization process during fabrication of the 
basic components. However, TDS provide conditions highly 
conducive for the induction of skin allergic 
reactions, and the following skin reactions may be 
expected to occur: 
1. Irritant reactions to the drug, an 
additive, an impurity, or a combination 
thereof; 2. Allergic reactions, especially to the low 
molecular weight components (drug, 
additive, impurity, adhesive); 3. Prolonged skin occlusion causes blocking of 
sweat ducts favoring local sweat retention 
syndrome. It is well known that many drugs, including 
some currently on the U.S. market, e.g., clonidine, 
sensitize the skin when used in a TDS. The skin 
inflammation produced by either the transdermally 
delivered drug, a non-irritating drug combined with 
skin irritating enhancers (discussed below), or a 
combination of an irritating or sensitizing drug and 
enhancer, may persist well beyond the time that the 
patch is removed from the skin. The local 
inflammation may be a source of discomfort and a 
clinical complication in a subject suffering from 
such a reaction. Psoriasis-like changes have been noted in 
skin from subjects receiving propranolol and other  
 
beta blockers (Brigden, W.D. et al., Brit. J. 
Dermatol. 95:335 (1976); Gaylarde, P.M. et al., 
Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 3:157 (1978)). Workers handling 
alprenolol have shown signs of
