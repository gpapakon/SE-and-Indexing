<ABSTRACT>
The telecommunication system includes a stored program system control for storing information on the respective type of terminal information and status. At least one of the connected telephone terminals is designed as a door entry phone (TS) connected to the relevant terminal line (ASL). Following a connection request or demand, a start criterion is derived, on the basis of the intended through-connection of the coupling path for the connection between a telephone terminal and the door entry phone, and effects the change of polarity of the terminal line cores, on the door-speaker side, resulting in the direct effective connection of the door-speaker amplifier (SU). An end criterion is derived by releasing the existing connection.
