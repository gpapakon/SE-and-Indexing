<ABSTRACT>
The object underlying the invention is to propose a mixing chamber by which a highly homogeneous mixture can be achieved, in particular of the substances which are poorly miscible per se. The mixing chamber is to be able to be integrated into a unified analytical system having the shortest possible measurement times and low reagent volumes. The object is achieved according to the invention by a mixing chamber having the following characteristics:   a) the mixing chamber contains a free space having side walls and a bottom; b) the free space is sealed on its side opposite the bottom by a piston which can slide in parallel to the side walls and is movable in the free space, c) the effective cross-section of which perpendicular to the side walls is selected in such a way that the free space is sealed liquid-tightly; d) the free space further contains a mixer die which is arranged between the bottom and the piston,   e) is movable in parallel to the side walls,   f) is composed of a ferromagnetic or paramagnetic material and g) is held by constructional means at an approximately constant distance to the side walls; h) the free space is surrounded by at least one electromagnetic coil,     i) via which the mixer die can be moved; k) at least two liquid lines which can be shut off open out into the free space.
