A box-pallet comprising a container (2) of a semi-rigid 
material such as corrugated cardboard and a single 

wooden rectangular pallet (1) with which the container is 
integral, this container comprising a bottom part (7) 

integral with the pallet and a body (3) adjoining this bottom 
part, open at its lower part and capable of being folded flat 

in the plane of the upper surface of the pallet, the body (3) 
of the container having a parallelepipedic shape of 

transverse section substantially equal to the upper surface 
of the pallet and comprising four walls articulated together 

by fold lines which, when the box-pallet is in the use 
position, form edges perpendicular to the upper surface of 

the pallet, two parallel walls (5) of this body further 
comprising a median fold line (6) parallel with these edges, 

which divides them into two equal parts (5a-5b), in such a 
way that it is possible to fold them in concertina fashion 

between the other two walls which are also parallel with each 
other, this box-pallet being characterized
 
   in that the bottom part (7) consists of a member mounted 

in the form of a dihedron comprising two flaps (7a, 7b) 
articulated so as to form a dihedral edge angle (10), 

parallel with the walls (4) of the body not comprising a 
median fold line and arranged in the same plane as the median 

fold lines (6) of the other two walls (5), these two flaps 
(7a-7b) respectively adjoining the walls (4) not comprising 

median fold lines via a part (8a) adhered or clipped to these 
walls (4) and articulated to the associated flap (7a-7b) by a 

fold line arranged at the base of these walls (4) and 
extending over the whole length of this base;
 
   in that the two flaps of the member in the form of a 

dihedron forming the bottom part of the container further 
extend beyond the fold line forming the edge of the dihedron,  

 
along a strip (11a-11b) which projects at the base of the 

container externally of the bottom part and which is pinched 
between two parallel laths (12a-12b) of the pallet, without 

any other means of connection therewith;
 
   and in that one of the flaps (7a-7b) of the dihedron 

forming the bottom part (7) is firmly connected laterally, by 
adhesion or clipping, with two angle irons (9), one branch of 

each of which rests on the pallet, perpendicularly with 
respect to the edge (10) of the dihedron, over substantially 

the whole length of the corresponding side of the pallet, 
while their other branches are perpendicular to the upper 

surface of the pallet, in such a way that, when the box-pallet 
is in the use position, this branch is applied 

laterally against the base of the walls (5) of the container 
body comprising the median fold lines (6). 
A box-pallet according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the walls (5) of the container body divided into two 

equal parts (5a,5b) by a median fold line (6) are internally 
lined by a reinforcing flap (12) adjoining the contiguous 

wall (4) via a fold line and firmly connected by adhesion or 
clipping with the contiguous part (5b) of the wall (5) 

comprising the median fold line (6). 
A variant of the pallet according to claim 1, in which 
the angle irons (9) are fixed to the pallet (1) and not the 

container (2).
