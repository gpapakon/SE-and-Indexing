<ABSTRACT>
The network provides switched video services by 
transmitting video packets or copies thereof, which are 

part of a video signal, to user stations US1/US5 connected 
to the network, in response to received control signals 

issued by said user stations. It includes a plurality of 
intercoupled switching modules SM1/SM3 to realize said 

transmission, and control circuits CC1/CC3 and copy 
modules CM1/CM3 associated to distinct ones of these 

switching modules, to handle the control signals and make 
the copies respectively. The switching modules are 

multipath self routing switching modules which are able to 
convey through the network the video packets/packet copies 

and control signals. They are intercoupled by groups of 
links and are each able, when operated by an associated 

control circuit to convey the video packets/packet copies 
of a video signal to any one of the links of a 

predetermined group which is chosen based on address 
related information concerning the destination of a video 

signal of which the handled packets form part and which is 

contained in the control signal related to this video 
signal. At least one of the copy modules includes a 

plurality of copy circuits each of which is able to make at 
least part of the requested copies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network for 
providing switched video services by transmitting video 
packets or copies of said packets, which are part of a 
video signal, to user stations connected to said network, 
in response to received control signals issued by said user 
stations, said network including a plurality of 
intercoupled switching modules to realize said 
transmission, and control circuits and copy modules 
associated to distinct ones of said switching modules, to 
handle said control signals and make said copies 
respectively. Such a video on demand network is already known 
in the art, e.g. from the article "Hierarchical 
Distribution of Video with Dynamic Port Allocation" by Tak-Shing 
et al, IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 39, 
No. 8, August 1991, pp. 1268 to 1274. In this network 
however,no features are foreseen to make it reliable. 
Moreover the traffic load which can be handled by the links 
of this known network is restricted. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a video on demand network of the above known type but which 
is realized in such a way that it is more reliable and can 
handle a higher load of the links than the above known 
network. According to the invention, this object is 
achieved due to the fact that said switching modules are 
multipath self routing switching modules which are able to 
convey through said network said video packets/packet 
copies and control signals, that said switching modules are 
intercoupled by groups of links and are each able, when 
operated by a said associated control circuit, to convey 
for a said video signal the video packets/packet copies 
thereof to any one of said links of a predetermined group 
which is chosen based on address related information 
concerning the destination of said video signal and  
 
contained in a said control signal related to said video 
signal and that at least one of said copy modules 
associated to a said switching module includes a plurality 
of copy circuits each of which is able to make at least 
part of said copies when operated by a said control circuit 
associated to said switching module. Indeed, due to the inherent switch redundancy of 
the multipath self routing modules, to the multiplication 
of the copy circuit which are each able to make packet 
copies, and to the link redundancy of the links in the link 
groups, the network is a reliable network with relatively 
high availability of transmission resources and it can 
handle a higher load of the links than the known
