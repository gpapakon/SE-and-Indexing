<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, a concept of 
functional quantities indicative of quantified functional 

degrees of such lower-level functions as "clearer characters", 
"cleaner background", and "thicker characters", which are 

subordinating to a qualification-oriented function of "more 
attractive characters". Characteristic patterns of functional 

quantities F1, F2 and F3 of the lower-level functions for 
physical parameters (for example, the surface potential of a 

photoreceptor body) are prepared. When a fault repair is 
implemented by changing a value of a physical parameter, a 

tradeoff is made between lower-level functions which are influenced by 
the physical parameter. That is, taking into account the 

functional quantities F1, F2 and F3 of the lower-level 
functions, the value of the physical parameter is set so that 

the functional quantity of the function of "more attractive 
characters" is maximized. By introducing the concept of the 

functional quantities indicative of the quantified functional 
degrees of the functions, a flexible self-repairing function 

can be realized, thereby optimizing a repair operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus having a
self-repairing function which implements a self-repair of a
fault which prevents the apparatus from satisfactorily
performing a given function, and a method of self-repairing
the apparatus.It has been proposed in the field of image forming
apparatus such as copying machines to additionally provide a
so-called self-repairing function. The self-repairing
function is intended to make diagnoses and repairs on
functions relative to image forming for maintenance.In the apparatus disclosed in this publication, a
function to be maintained is monitored by checking whether the
function is active or not, and the repair of the function is
achieved by actuating another function which can substitute
for the function to be maintained.That is, the conventional self-repairing function employs 
so-called "two-choice" diagnosing and repairing approaches
and, therefore, does not take into consideration degrees of
functional degradation and functional recovery. This may be
attributed to the difficulty in quantifying the abstract
concept of functions.Accordingly, the conventional self-repairing function
makes an extreme choice in a certain sense, which includes
such choices that other functions are abandoned for the
maintenance of a particular function A, and that a method of
repairing (a) for a particular function A is not employed
because the method may influence the other functions.EP-A-0 476 681 describes an image forming apparatus having a self repair function including repair plan proposing means which are responsive to a fault analysing means which are based on detector outputs. The repair plan proposing means suggests a plurality of repair plans. Each repair plan indicates a physical parameter to be changed and the secondary effects which are produced by the proposed change. If the repair plan having the fewest secondary effects cannot be implemented, the repair plan having the next fewest secondary effects is implemented.In view of the foregoing difficulty, it is an object of
the present invention to provide an apparatus having a self-repairing
function which implements a flexible repair by
introducing a concept of a functional quantity indicative of a
quantified functional degree.It is another object of the present invention to provide
an improved method of self-repairing an apparatus which
implements a flexible repair by introducing a concept of a
functional quantity indicative of a quantified functional
degree.According to one aspect of the present invention,
