<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONTreatment of Cellular Hyper-Proliferation bv Inhibition of Interleukin-1Cross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThe present application is a continuation in part of United States Serial No. 07/707,897 filed May 31, 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.Background of the InventionThe present invention is directed to methods of treatment of cellular hyperproliteration. These methods are useful in the treatment of various pathologic con- ditions characterized by over-proliferation of cells, especially epithelial cells and, more particularly, keratinocytes.Conditions characterized by hyperproliferation of cells, particularly keratinocytes, have proved difficult to treat. Conventional therapies for some of these conditions such as psoriasis have been unsatisfactory. Thus, there exists a need for therapies which can treat these conditions by decreasing or preventing over- proliferation of cells. Cytokine levels in certain conditions characterized by cellular hyperproliferation have been studied. In particular, there have been attempts to compare levels of Interleukin-lα and Interleukin-13 in normal and in psori- atic skin. Interleukin-1 activity in psoriatic skin has been reported to be reduced in relation to normal skin. However, in psoriatic skin higher levels of a high mole-, cular weight Interleukin-1S in comparison to Interleukin- 1/3 levels in normal skin form have been reported. (See, Cooper et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. .95.(5) :245 to 265 (1990) ) . 

Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides methods of preventing or decreasing hyperproliferation of cells, particularly epithelial cells, by inhibiting or decreasing inhibition of Interleukin-1 ("IL-l") activity or intracellular Inter- leukin-1 receptor antagonist activity. Thus, the present invention is directed to such methods which comprise con¬ tacting the cells with a hyperproliferation inhibiting amount of an Interleukin-1 inhibitory compound. Inter- leukin-1 inhibitory compounds include compounds which decrease Interleukin-1 or intracellular Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist activity. According to one aspect, Interleukin-1 activity is inhibited by inhibiting or down- regulating its synthesis. According to another aspect, Interleukin-1 activity is inhibited by inhibiting conver¬ sion of a precursor form into an active form. This inhi¬ bition of conversion into an active form may be accom¬ plished by one of several means, including, but not lim¬ ited to, preventing or decreasing expression of a
