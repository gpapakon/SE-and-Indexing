<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to liquid polymer preparations having non-Newtonic flow behaviour, and to a process for their preparation and to coating compositions containing them, which are suitable, in particular, for multilayer-effect finishes. The liquid polymer preparations are prepared from   a) an aqueous dispersion having a viscosity of from 20 to 200 mPa.s of one or more dispersed polymers obtained by suspension or emulsion polymerisation of     2-10 % by weight of acrylonitrile and/or methacrylonitrile,   1-3 % by weight of acrylamide and/or methacrylamide, and 87-97 % by weight of one or more acrylic ester (acrylates) and/or methacrylic ester (methacrylate) monomers,  by b) addition of such an amount of a water-immiscible solvent which partially dissolves or swells the polymers that the viscosity increases to at least 10
<
4
>
 times the original viscosity, c) simultaneously or subsequently adding a diluent which is miscible with water and the partially dissolving or swelling solvent in order to achieve a viscosity of from 25 to 1,000 mPa.s, and then d) if necessary removing water.
