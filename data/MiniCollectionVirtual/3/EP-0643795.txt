<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to completing an uncased section 
of a borehole in an underground formation. An example of such a 
borehole is a borehole drilled to a hydrocarbon-containing formation 
in order to produce hydrocarbons from the formation. To prevent collapse of the wall of the borehole, the borehole 
is cased by means of a casing arranged in the borehole, which 
casing is fixed in the borehole by a cement layer between the outer 
wall of the casing and the inner wall of the borehole. To allow substantially unrestricted influx of fluids from the 
hydrocarbon-containing formation into the borehole, the borehole is 
not cased where it traverses the hydrocarbon-containing formation. 
When the hydrocarbon-containing formation is so weak that it will 
collapse, the uncased borehole section is completed with a liner 
which is provided with slots to allow fluid influx into the borehole. A known method of completing an uncased section of a borehole 
in an underground formation comprises the steps of placing a 
slotted liner in the borehole at the location of the hydrocarbon-containing 
formation and fixing the liner. Fixing the liner is 
usually done by securing the upper end of the liner to the lower 
end of the casing arranged in the borehole. As the inner diameter of the cased section is less than the 
diameter of the borehole and as the slotted liner has to be lowered 
through the cased section of the borehole, the diameter of the 
slotted liner is smaller than the diameter of the borehole, and 
thus there is an annular space between the liner and the wall of 
the borehole. With time the formation will collapse and settle 
against the outer wall of the liner so that the annular space gets 
filled with particulates. When hydrocarbons are produced, the fluid 
will flow through the formation, through the filled annular space  
 
and through the slots in the liner into the cased borehole. The 
circumference through which fluids flow into the cased borehole is 
thus reduced from the circumference of the borehole to the circumference 
of the outer wall of the liner. USA patent specification No. 3 191 680 discloses a method of 
completing an uncased section of a borehole in an underground 
formation, which method comprises the steps of (a) placing at a 
predetermined position in the borehole a corrugated liner; (b) 
fixing the corrugated liner; and (c) moving through the corrugated 
liner an expansion mandrel which is tapered in the direction in 
which the mandrel is moved through the liner. The outer

characterized in that the liner is a slotted liner provided with 

overlapping longitudinal slots, that the mandrel has a largest 
diameter which is larger than the inner diameter of the slotted 

liner, and in that the slots are expanded. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises placing 
at a predetermined position in the borehole a system of two or more 

slotted liners one arranged in the other and each slotted liner 
being provided with overlapping longitudinal slots. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the outer surface of the 
slotted liner is provided with a wrapping. 
Method according to claim 2, wherein the outer surface of the 
outermost slotted liner is provided with a wrapping. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1-4, wherein step (c) 
comprises moving through the slotted liner an expansion mandrel 

consisting of a cylindrical housing having outwardly deflecting 
fingers and a cone arranged with axial play in the cylindrical 

housing to deflect the fingers outwardly.
