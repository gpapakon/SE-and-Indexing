<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for treating fly ash/APC residues chlorides, sulphates, earth alkali metals selected from the group consisting of calcium, potassium, and sodium, and heavy metals selected from the group consisting of lead, which residues are obtained from air pollution control processes that utilize dry/semi-dry lime injection, such that said residues may be disposed of as non-hazardous materials. The process comprises the sequential steps of: (a) washing and agitating the fly ash/APC residue (20) with water (50) to form a residue slurry containing solubilized lead salts and calcium chloride; (b) filtering (42) the residue slurry to remove a filtrate (46) having a pH of higher than about 11.8 and containing the solubilized lead salts and calcium chloride; and (c) recovering a first calcium enriched filter cake (44). The solubilized lead salts are then removed from the filtrate by the sub-steps of: (i) adding sufficient hydrochloric acid (58) to the filtrate to lower the pH thereof to between about 10 and 11; (ii) agitating the filtrate until a colour change from white to yellow occurs; (iii) adding additional sufficient hydrochloric acid to the filtrate so agitated to lower the pH to between about 7 and 8; (iv) filtering (82) the filtrate to remove a brine (86) containing calcium chloride; and (v) recovering a second yellow coloured, lead enriched filter cake (84).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air pollution control
(APC) technologies. More particularly the present invention
relates to a process for treating the fly ash/ air pollution
control process residues obtained from air pollution control
processes that utilize dry/semi-dry lime injection, such that
the ash residues may be disposed of as non-hazardous materials.During the late 1970's and early 1980's, concern over the
emissions from the practice of municipal solid waste (MSW)
incineration resulted in the development of more efficient
incinerator operating conditions and improved air pollution
control technologies. In turn, this enhanced ability to
minimise emissions has resulted in the capture of greater
volumes of contaminated residues in modern air pollution
control (APC) systems. It is generally acknowledged that
incineration typically results in a 90% reduction in the
overall volume of material for disposal, and a 60 to 75%
reduction in weight of municipal solid waste (MSW).The incineration of municipal wastes is generally
recognized to produce the following products: bottom ash and
fly ash. Between 70 and 95% of the total ash generated by
municipal waste incineration is characterized as bottom ash.
Bottom ash typically contains less than 2% combustible
material. Due to the extemely high temperatures at which the
incineration of municipal solid wastes occur (typically about
1000Â°C), there is virtually complete dissociation of organic
compounds and volatilization of some metal species, leaving the
bottom ash relatively heat stable and chemically inert. Typically bottom ash is relatively insoluble, with only
approximately 5% of the total mass thereof being soluble in
water.The remainder of the waste incineration product is
classified as fly ash. Fly ash is very soluble in water. For
example, up to 30% of heat recovery system ash is soluble in
water. The most common species measured in the leachates from
fly ash are salts and other flue gas reaction products,
specifically chloride and sulphate compounds. Chlorides alone
can account for almost 40 % of the weight of the soluble
fraction of some fly ash. Accordingly, fly ash poses a
contamination risk if it is disposed of in such a way that it
may come into contact with ground water. Fly ash is considered
to be a hazardous waste, necessitating "storage" in underground
abandoned mines, or in specialized cells in landfill sites.
Alternatively, fly ash must be treated prior to disposal if it
is to be disposed of as a non-hazardous material.Wide spread
