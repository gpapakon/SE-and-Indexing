<ABSTRACT>
A flexible lined hose assembly comprises a smooth bore 
fluorocarbon liner (10) reinforced by a wire (21) which is 

wound in a single helix with an open pitch at least 1.25 times 
the wire diameter. Optionally further reinforcement is 

provided by a wire braid (20) applied either directly to the 
liner (10) or on to the outside of the helical wire (21), the 

whole construction then optionally being enclosed within a 
rubber cover (22) which is not bonded to the liner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible reinforced lined 
hose assembly for use in particular in foodstuffs and chemical 
manufacturing plants. Hose assemblies comprising a fluorocarbon (PTFE which is 
polytetrafluoroethylene, PFA which is perfluoralkoxy or FEP 
which is fluorinated ethylene-propylene, all plastics supplied 
by Du Pont under the Trade Name TEFLON) lining are commonly 
used in foodstuffs and chemical manufacturing plants, where the 
chemical resistance and non-stick nature of the fluorocarbon 
are a major advantage. However, fluorocarbons are not fully flexible materials and 
hose designs for bore sizes above approximately 20mm render the 
hose either resistant to kinking and vacuum collapse of the 
liner but very stiff, or flexible but kink-prone and not vacuum 
resistant. One approach to solve this problem is to convolute the 
fluorocarbon liner which renders the hose both flexible and 
vacuum and kink-resistant but introduces another problem in 
that process fluids passing through the hose can collect in the 
convolutions, so that the hose is no longer self-draining and 
self-cleaning, and is therefore only suitable for use in the 
aforementioned industries in situations where these properties 
are not required. Another approach for larger fluorocarbon lined hose assemblies 
is to reinforce the liner against kinking and vacuum by bonding 
the liner externally to a rubber cover which incorporates 
textile braids or wraps, and a helical wire reinforcement. One 
disadvantage of this design is that bonding the fluorocarbon 
liner to the rubber cover makes the resultant hose stiffer than 
it would otherwise be. Another disadvantage is that the 
bonding makes it impossible to attach end fittings in such a 
manner that the self-cleaning and self-draining facilities of  
 
the hose are maintained. Examples of such "bonded" reinforced 
hose assemblies are disclosed in US Patent No 5,062,456 (to 
Cooke et al) and US Patent No 4,706,712 (Oglesby et al), both 
of which describe bonding the liner to one or more external 
layers, with soft (textile or rubber) layers between the liner 
and the helical reinforcing wire. An example of a reinforced hose assembly having an inner 
rubber liner, its method of manufacture and a method 
of securing to it an end fitting, is disclosed in DE-B-1 212 371. It is also known to reinforce a fluorocarbon liner by winding 
a wire helically and directly on to the liner, to increase the 
pressure resistance of the hose. In this case the wire is 
always wound at

characterised in that the liner, wire and braid assembly is 

covered with a rubber cover (22) which fully or partially 
encapsulates the helical wire (21). 
An assembly according to Claim 12 further characterised in

silicone rubber. 
A method of manufacturing a flexible lined hose assembly

or on to a substantially radially rigid reinforcing layer (20) 
surrounding said liner, without any bonding between the liner 

and any external layer.
