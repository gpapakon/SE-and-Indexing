<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substrate having a
surface on which water drops scarcely attach or from
which attached water drops can easily be removed.EP-A-0 513 690 discloses a surface-treated substrate consisting essentially of a
substrate having two treated surface layers wherein the first layer constituting the
outermost layer among the treated surface layers is a layer obtained by treatment with
a compound capable of forming a surface having a contact angle of at least 70°
against water, and the second layer constituting an underlayer in contact with the
outermost layer. EP-A-0 513 690 does not disclose an underlayer obtained by treating
the surface of the substrate
with a treating agent containing a compound capable of forming a thin film of a heat
resistant polymer and fine particles of a polymer, thereby forming a thin film, and by
heating the thin film to thermally decompose the fine particles of a polymer.Various substrates or various substrates having
treated surface layers are used in various fields, and
adverse effects brought about by water to the surface of
such substrates are problematic.For example, in transportation equipments such as
electric cars, automobiles, ships or aircrafts, the
surface of an exterior part such as an outer panel, a
window glass, a mirror or a display surface material, an
interior part such as an instrument panel, or other 
articles, is desired to be always clean. If rain drops,
dusts or soils are attached, or moisture is condensed by
an influence of the temperature or humidity in air, on
the surface of an article in a transportation equipment,
the outer appearance will be impaired. If such is a
surface which is directly visually observed or a surface
which is directly touched by a person, it may give an 
unpleasant feeling or may create a hygienic problem.
Further, such may bring about a deterioration of the
inherent function which the article for a transportation
instrument has. Especially in a case where the article
for the transportation equipment is an article for which
transparency or see-through property is required (such as
a window glass or a mirror), a deterioration of the
transparency or see-through property may mean that the
purpose intended by the article can not be attained, and
may cause a serious accident.A means to remove water drops (such as removal by
wiping off or by means of a wiper) may sometimes impart
fine scratch marks on the surface. Further, such scratch
marks may sometimes be widened by foreign particles
accompanying water drops.
