<ABSTRACT>
A flexible optical coupler for coupling light signals from an optical waveguide on a circuit board or substrate to an optical waveguide on another circuit board or substrate, or to an optical port on an electronic, opto-electronic or photonic integrated circuit. The coupler is self-aligning by virtue of the design of the alignment stops fabricated in close proximity to the optical waveguide or optical port. The coupler may consist of an array of optical waveguides between an array of optical ports and another array of optical ports. The coupler may be used with any substrates appropriate for polymeric waveguide fabrication, including many circuit board materials. The optical waveguide of the coupler is on a flexible and transparent substrate. The coupler is effective for optical connections between devices situated on noncoincident surfaces. Alignment stops are utilized for the case of aligning the ports of the optical coupler to other ports. Alignment stop fabrication is not restricted to crystallographic etch processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to optical couplers and particularly to couplers for
coupling light from an optical waveguide on a board or substrate to an optical port on an
integrated circuit.Coupling light from an optical waveguide on a planar printed circuit board or
chip substrate via a mount to an optical port on an electronic, opto-electronic or
photonic integrated circuit is very difficult to achieve, in the related art, if such coupling
is to have high throughput efficiency, tolerance to variations in temperature and
wavelength, robustness, and low assembly and maintenance cost.A technology report published in the August 1985 issue of LASER FOCUS/ELECTRO-OPTICS
shows on page 48 a ridge coupler design including a glass coupler of a semi-flexible
guide that can be placed on an IO structure to establish evanescent coupling of
signal energy. W092/00538 describes an optical system comprising several optical boards
which are optically interconnected by fiber ribbons, each consisting of several fibers. Each
fiber ribbon is at its ends provided with a fiber connector. The connector essentially consists
of two plates of crystalline material, wherein the adjacent surfaces of the two plates are
provided with a plurality of parallel complementary micro-machined grooves which take up
the end portions of the fibers. For aligning the connector block, consisting of said two plates
with the fiber ends clamped between them, against the optical board, each pair of plates
comprises two additional grooves of larger cross-section, and the board has two projecting
rods which project into those alignment grooves and therewith align the connector block
with the optical board.The present invention is a flexible waveguide having ports on each end that are
self-aligning with respect to the ports that they are connected to. The invention
eliminates the problems associated with coupling light from an optical channel
waveguide on a planar surface to an optical port on another surface noncoincident with
the first surface. With the invention, a light signal is coupled from an optical channel
waveguide, preferably in the form of a rectangular polymeric channel waveguide, to an
optical port on an electronic, opto-electronic or photonic integrated circuit which is
situated in a different plane than the optical waveguide. The optical coupler is
functionally equivalent to an optical analog of the electrical "wire bond" or "tape-automated
bond" (TAB) which is used to connect two, possibly dissimilar, surfaces or
contacts together,
