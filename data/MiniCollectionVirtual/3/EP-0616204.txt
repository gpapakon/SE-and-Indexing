<ABSTRACT>
On-line rheological measurements are made utilizing a 
rheometer (20) of the type in which a first metering pump (24) delivers 

diverted melt from a process main stream to a capillary passage (36) and 
a second metering pump (34) returns the diverted melt from the capillary 

passage to the process main stream and the viscosity of the 
diverted melt is measured by controlling the rate of flow of the 

melt through the capillary passage to maintain constant the 
pressure drop between spaced apart locations along the capillary 

passage and measuring the temperature of the melt in the capillary 
passage. The measurements may be made while controlling the speed 

of the second metering pump independent of the speed of the first 
metering pump to maintain the pressure at the exit of the capillary 

passage essentially constant. A parallel flow passage (70) has an inlet 
placed between the first metering pump and the entrance to the 

capillary passage, in close juxtaposition with the entrance, and an 
outlet placed between the exit from the capillary passage and the 

second metering pump, and a valve (76) in the parallel flow passage is 
operated so that diverted melt selectively is passed through the 

parallel flow passage to attain a relatively quick response and 
relatively short residence time of the diverted melt in the 

rheometer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the measurement of 
rheological characteristics of melted materials and pertains, more 
specifically, to the on-line measurement of such characteristics as 
the viscosity of polymer melts for purposes of control of 
manufacturing processes involving molten plastics. Rheological testing equipment has been available for a very 
long time in conducting laboratory measurements of certain 
important characteristics of polymer melts used in various 
manufacturing processes. Thus, such properties as viscosity and 
melt flow index are being measured in the laboratory with 
increasing accuracy. More recently, efforts have been directed 
toward the measurement of these characteristics on-line, during the 
manufacturing process itself, in order to provide constant, closer 
control over the quality of the melt utilized in the process. On-line 
measurement requires equipment which not only is relatively 
easy to use and maintain, but which is rugged enough to withstand 
the operating conditions to which the equipment will be exposed. 
In order to be effective, the equipment must be responsive, and 
must avoid disturbing the manufacturing process being monitored. Among the more successful on-line rheometers available 
currently are capillary rheometers which divert a portion of the 
polymer melt from the main stream of molten plastic, conduct 
measurements on the diverted melt, and then either discard the 
diverted melt or return the diverted melt to the process main 
stream. In United States patent number 4,817,416, the disclosure  
 
of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto, there is 
disclosed an on-line capillary rheometer and techniques for 
conducting on-line measurements of the type described above. The 
present invention constitutes an improvement in on-line capillary 
rheometers and in the techniques which utilize apparatus of the 
type in which melt is diverted to a rheometer and further extends 
the capability of such on-line rheometers to enable effective use 
in connection with the control of processes where measurements must 
be conducted quickly and response time must be held to a minimum, 
such as processes in which polymers are blended, alloyed or 
reacted. More specifically, the present invention has several 
objectives and provides a number of advantages, some of which are 
summarized as follows: Enables truly on-line measurements for 
attaining quicker response and more accurate control of 
manufacturing processes involving polymer melts;
