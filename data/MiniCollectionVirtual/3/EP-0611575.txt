<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure-sensitive 
adhesive composition for skin, and more specifically to a 
pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for skin containing 
as a base an A-B-A type block copolymer wherein an A-block 
thereof if composed of styrene and/or styrene derivatives 
and a B-block thereof is composed of a conjugated diene 
and/or lower alkene. Pressure sensitive adhesives comprising a block 
copolymer of styrene, isoprene, etc. have been known. For 
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3519585, 3676202, and 3787531 
teaches such adhesives. Further, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. Sho 61-6872 discloses pressure-sensitive 
adhesives comprising a thermoplastic elastomer ingredient 
composed of an A-B type block copolymer and an A-B-A type 
block copolymer having excellent tackiness to the skin and 
to the oily surface. The present inventors have further studied adhesives 
for skin, and have found that excellent tackiness to a wet 
surface is one of the most important factors for adhesives 
to  
 
the skin. Consequently they have found that adhesives comprising 
a specific A-B-A type block copolymer as a base, a tackifier and 
a plasticizer have excellent tackiness to a wet skin surface as 
well as a dry skin surface, and have attained the present 
invention. The present invention, therefore, relates to a 
pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for skin comprising 
22-40 % by weight of a base composed substantially of an A-B-A 
type block copolymer wherein an A-block thereof is composed of 
styrene and/or styrene derivatives and a B-block thereof is 
composed of a conjugated diene and/or lower alkene,
 
40-60 % by weight of a tackifier, and
 
5-23 % by weight of a plasticizer. The base of the adhesive of the present invention comprises 
substantially an A-B-A type block copolymer wherein an A-block 
thereof is composed of styrene and/or styrene derivatives and a 
B-block thereof is composed of a conjugated diene and/or lower 
alkene. The above styrene derivatives include compounds in which 
hydrogen(s) of a vinyl radical and/or benzene ring of styrene 
is(are) substituted with alkyl radical(s) or halogen atom(s), 
for example, alpha-methyl styrene and para-halogenated styrene. The A-block of the A-B-A type block copolymer of the present 
invention is a homopolymer or copolymer of styrene and/or styrene 
derivatives, and the number average molecular weight of the A-block 
is preferably at least 7,000, more preferably in the range 
of 12,000-30,000. The B-block of the A-B-A type block
