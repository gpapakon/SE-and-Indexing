<ABSTRACT>
A slot fed antenna for use in radiating energy, the antenna including a flat conductive 
member having an elongated vertically-oriented slot dividing the member into a pair of 

horizontally-extending variable-length flat dipole wing elements. Each dipole wing element has 
a vertically-extending rectilinear edge. Also, each wing element extends in width in a direction 

perpendicular to the rectilinear edge from a minimum at its center and at each of its upper and 
lower ends to a maximum midway between each of the ends and the center.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antennas and, in particularly, to variable length slot fed dipole
antennas.Known antennas are frequently referred to as bat wing or delta wing antennas, and
include a pair of flat conductive members which are mounted to a mast with the conductive
members of each pair extending outwardly in a vertical plane. The conductive members are
sometimes referred to as wings. Such an antenna, is disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent
No. 2,480,154. Each wing includes a vertically-extending rectilinear edge extending parallel to
the vertical mast. Each wing extends away from the rectilinear edge so that the width of the
wing in a direction perpendicular to the edge varies in width along the entire length so that it
has a width at the center of the wing of approximately one-eighth wavelength and is
approximately one-quarter wavelength at its upper and lower ends. Such antennas are excited
by a coaxial cable connected to the antenna wings. A similar configuration to that of the antenna
disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 2.480,154 has the form of a vertically-oriented slot dividing
the member into a pair of slot fed horizontally-extending dipole wing elements with each wing
element corresponding with that as shown in the U.S. patent and in Fig. 1 to be described
hereinafter.The present invention is directed toward improvements in
impedance bandwidth and in pattern bandwidth. As used herein, the term impedance bandwidth
refers to the percentage of frequency for which the impedance performance does not exceed a
predetermined VSWR specification. Also, the term pattern bandwidth, as used herein, refers to
the percentage of frequency for which the half power beamwidth performance does not vary
beyond a predetermined maximum and minimum.An object of the invention is to provide an antenna having improved impedance
bandwidth and pattern bandwidth.The present invention includes a slot fed antenna for use in radiating energy and 
comprising a flat conductive member having an elongated vertically-oriented slot dividing said
member into a pair of horizontally-extending variable length flat dipole wing elements, each of
said flat dipole wing elements having a vertically-extending rectilinear edge formed by said slot,
each said wing element continuously and uniformally extending in width in a direction
perpendicular to said edge from a minimum at the center of said edge and at each of the upper
and lower ends of said edge to a maximum of one-half way between each said end and said
center and in which
