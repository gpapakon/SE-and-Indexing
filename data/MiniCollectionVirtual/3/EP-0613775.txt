<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for preventing backlash between the meshing teeth (86, 72) of a driving toothed wheel (84) which can be rotated about a first axis in a first direction (26) and a driven toothed wheel (70, 76) which is rotated by the said driving toothed wheel (84) about a second axis in a second direction (28) counter to the first direction (26). The said device comprises the following features: an apparatus for transmitting a first torque to the driving toothed wheel (84) which forces the driving toothed wheel (84) to rotate in a first direction (26); an apparatus for transmitting a second torque to the driven toothed wheel (70, 76) which forces the driven toothed wheel (70, 76) to rotate in a direction counter to the second direction (28), the size of the said second torque and the size of the said first torque being equal.

Device for preventing play between the meshing 
teeth (86, 72) of a driving toothed wheel (84) which can 

be rotated about a first axis in a first direction (26) 
and of a driven toothed wheel (70, 76) which is rotated 

by the driving toothed wheel (84) about a second axis in 
a second direction (28) counter to the first direction 

(26), and the device comprises the following features: 

an arrangement for transmitting a first torque to the 
driving toothed wheel (84), which forces the driving 

toothed wheel (84) to rotate in a first direction (26); 
an arrangement for transmitting a second torque to the 
driven toothed wheel (70, 76), which forces the driven 

toothed wheel (70, 76) to rotate in a direction counter 
to the second direction (28), an arrangement for 

generating the torques, the magnitude of the second 
torque and the magnitude of the first torque being 

equivalent. 
Device according to Claim 1, which further 
comprises an arrangement, by means of which the 

magnitudes of said first and second torque are regulated 
in the same manner and these magnitudes are kept 

equivalent to one another. 
Device for preventing play between the meshing 
teeth (86, 72) of a driving toothed wheel (84) and of a 

driven toothed wheel (70, 76), which comprises the 
following features: 


a first toothed wheel (92) with teeth (94) which mesh 
with the teeth (86) of one (84) of the driving or of the 

driven toothed wheels (84; 70, 76), the first toothed  
 

wheel (92) being rotatable about a first axis in a first 
direction; 
a second toothed wheel (108) which is arranged coaxially 
with the first toothed wheel (92) and is rotatable about 

the first axis, relative to the first toothed wheel (92) 
in a second direction counter to the first direction; 
a third toothed wheel (136) with teeth (134) which mesh 
with the teeth (78) of the other (70, 76) of the driving 

or driven toothed wheels (84; 70, 76) and with the teeth 
(132) of the second toothed wheel (108), the third 

toothed wheel (136) being rotatable about a second axis 
in a direction counter to the second direction; 
and an arrangement for equivalent pretensioning of the 
first and second toothed wheel so that these rotate in 

opposite directions relative to one another. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that said pretensioning arrangement is a torsion spring 

(122) which acts between said first and second toothed 
wheel (92, 108). 
Device according to Claim 4, which further 
comprises an arrangement for regulating said 

pretensioning arrangement, by means of which the force 
exerted by said pretensioning arrangement on said first 

and second toothed wheel (92, 108) is regulated. 
Device according to Claim 5, wherein further a 
shaft (96) is mounted rotatably about said first axis, 

said first toothed wheel (92) is fastened on said shaft 
(96), said second toothed wheel (108) is mounted on said 

shaft (96) so that it is rotatable relative to said shaft 
(96) and said first toothed wheel (92), said torsion 

spring (122) comprises turns which surround said shaft 
(96), a part of said torsion spring (122) being connected 

to said shaft (96) and another part of said torsion 
spring (122) to said second toothed wheel (108). 
Printing unit which comprises the following 
features:
