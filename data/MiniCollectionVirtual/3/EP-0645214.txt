<ABSTRACT>
A grinding method, in 
which an abrasive material (6) 

is ejected from a nozzle (1, 
108) onto a billet (3, W) so as 

to grind the same, and which is 
applied to a continuous casting 

step or a step subsequent thereto, 
which method is characterized 

in that abrasive material-mixed 
high-pressure water is 

applied in the form of a jet to 
the surface of a billet so as to 

grind a flaw-carrying portion 
(12, 12', 12'', 12''') thereof; and 

a grinding system for practising 
this grinding method, having 

a supply source (19-20, 
103) of a high-pressure liquid 

and an abrasive material, a 
nozzle (4, 102) connected to the 

supply source, and a combination 
of an abrasive material 

recovering unit (104) for recovering 
as necessary the abrasive 

material, which has been 
used for a grinding operation, 

and returning the same to the supply source, and a flaw detecting means (15-16, 101).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to material
surface grinding and, in particular, to a grinding method
and system for grinding defective surface portions of
steel products such as slabs, blooms and billets in
continuous casting lines or ingot casting lines or the
like and after-processes following the same.Steel products such as blooms, slabs and
billets, formed by continuous casting or ingot casting
processes, may develop various defects during their
casting. Such defects will lead to a reduction in
product yield and a deterioration in product quality in
after-processes following the casting.To cope with this problem, such defects are
removed by reconditioning during or after the production
of steel products such as slabs, blooms or billets, so
that only steel products from which all defects have been
removed are fed to the after-processes, thereby preventing
a reduction in product yield and a deterioration in
product quality.Generally adopted means for reconditioning
steel products are flame scarfing using a hot scarfer and 
grinding using a grinder. An example of the flame
scarfing method is shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
52-5644, according to which a gantry frame is arranged to
have two supporting beams, on which two movable nozzle
operation units for side and upper surface are mounted,
respectively. Another example of the flame scarfing
method is shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 52-81048,
according to which flame scarfing is performed by
using a plurality of transversely arranged torches,
making it possible to remove extensive defects without
performing auxiliary flame scarfing in transverse
direction at the beginning.Regarding grinding using a grinder, an example
thereof is shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 48-46993,
according to which billets, etc. are ground by
using an abrasive wheel whose grinding performance is
improved by employing a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder.
Another example of the grinding method is shown in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-242729, according to
which cast stainless steels or other stainless steel
products are reconditioned to effectively remove any
defective portions therefrom in a specific temperature
range, thereby avoiding the problem of the self-hardening
property of stainless steels.Apart from the above-described methods of
removing defects through reconditioning by flame scarfing
or grinding, various other reconditioning methods have
been proposed which are mainly directed to descaling 
during the production of steel products. For example,
