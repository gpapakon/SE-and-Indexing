<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a discharge lamp, in which an
emission or irradiation is obtained through resonance
lines, which are emitted from ions in an excitation state.Moreover, the invention relates to a lamp operation method for operating such discharge lamps.Conventionally in the case of a known discharge lamp an
emission through spectral lines is used, which are emitted
within an arc formed between electrodes at transitions of
atoms or ions from one excitation state to another excitation
state or ground state.Resonance lines, which are among the emission spectral
lines, which are emitted at transitions of atoms or ions
from one excitation state into a ground state, due to their
high transition probability, generally have a high radiation
factor, potentially.Lamps, whose irradiated resonance lines are short-wave
ultraviolet rays, therefore have a very high industrial
value. Lamps with a high output of short-wave ultraviolet
rays are e.g. necessary in photochemical industries, in the 
manufacture of semiconductor devices, etc. There are adequate
possibilities for covering such needs.However, in the presently used discharge lamps it is considered
disadvantageous that there is unavoidably a so-called
self absorption phenomenon. This means that optically-thick
spectral lines such as resonance lines, which are emitted
within the arc from the atoms or ions in the excitation
state, are absorbed to a high degree by similar atoms or
ions. These atoms or ions simultaneously coexist in a
ground state. The consequence of this the radiation light
to be obtained through the resonance lines is not radiated
to the outside with a high radiation intensity from the
lamp and in practice the latter is unusable.For example, in the case of a mercury arc lamp of the short
arc type, resonance lines with wavelength of 185 nm and
254 nm emitted by Hg in an excitation state within a high
temperature arc are absorbed by Hg, which is present in a
part having a low temperature in a periphery of the arc and
is in a ground state. Therefore the resonance lines are
only radiated to the outside from the lamp to a very small
extent.In the case of discharge lamps an emitted light intensity
can normally be increased by raising a partial pressure of
a major emission material and by increasing the temperature
of the emission atoms or ions during operation. However,
resonance lines can only be emitted by reducing the self-absorption
phenomenon. For example, resonance lines with
the wavelength 254 nm and which are emitted by Hg, only have
an
