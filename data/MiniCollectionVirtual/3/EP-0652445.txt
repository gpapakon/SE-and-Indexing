<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for inspecting an electric component 
in an inverter circuit has a DC power supply 14 for 

supplying a direct current to a given position in an 
inverter circuit, a voltage detector 16 for detecting a 

voltage at a given position in the inverter circuit, a 
current detector 18 for detecting a current flowing at a 

given position in the inverter circuit, a switching circuit 
24 for changing positions at which the direct current is 

supplied from the DC power supply 14, positions at which the 
voltage is detected by the voltage detector 16, and 

positions at which the current is detected by the current 
detector 18, and a controller 26 for outputting a switching 

signal to the switching circuit 24. The switching circuit 
24 is controlled by the controller 26 to charge an 

electrolytic capacitor in an inverter circuit with a current 
from the DC power supply 14. The electrolytic capacitor is 

determined as to its quality by determining whether the 
calculated electrolytic capacitance of the electrolytic 

capacitor falls within a preset range or not. Each of 
transistors of the inverter circuit is determined as to its 

quality by determining whether an V
CE

C
 curve thereof 
falls in a preset range or not. The electrolytic capacitor, 

the transistors, and also diodes connected across the 
transistors can be determined as to whether they acceptable 

or not while they are being connected in the inverter circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
inspecting an electric component in an inverter circuit, and 
more particularly to an inspection apparatus for inspecting 
an electric component in an inverter circuit which converts 
a direct current into an alternating current while the 
electric component is being connected in an inverter 
circuit. Inverters have heretofore been used for turning on 
and off transistors based on control pulses supplied from a 
controller to convert a direct current into an alternating 
current for energizing a load such as a welding machine, an 
AC motor, or the like. One typical inverter circuit comprises an 
electrolytic capacitor for smoothing a voltage, a plurality 
of transistors, and a plurality of diodes coupled in 
inverse-parallel connection to the respective transistors. 
These electric components have to be inspected immediately 
after they are assembled and subsequently at certain 
periodic time intervals because of deterioration due to 
usage. It has been customary to remove each electric 
component from the inverter circuit and inspect the removed  
 
electric component with a dedicated instrument to determine 
whether the electric component is of acceptable quality or 
not. Heretofore, an electrolytic capacitor has been 
inspected as follows: The electrostatic capacitance and 
equivalent series resistance of the electrolytic capacitor 
are measured by an LCR meter, for example, and the 
electrolytic capacitor is determined as to its quality from 
the measured electrostatic capacitance and equivalent series 
resistance. In the inspection process using the LCR meter, 
a voltage across the electrolytic capacitor is measured 
while a small alternating current of several mA is passing 
through the electrolytic capacitor, and the electrostatic 
capacitance and equivalent series resistance of the 
electrolytic capacitor are calculated based on the measured 
voltage. The electrolytic capacitor is determined as to its 
quality by checking if the calculated electrostatic 
capacitance and equivalent series resistance fall in 
respective predetermined ranges or not. Another inspection process is disclosed in 
Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 5-215800, for 
example. In the disclosed inspection process, an 
electrolytic capacitor to be inspected is charged through a 
resistor, and a charging time required from the time when 
the electrolytic capacitor starts being charged until it is 
charged to a predetermined voltage thereacross is measured.
