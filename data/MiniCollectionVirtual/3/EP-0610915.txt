<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a biodegradable water-resistant 
film. The process includes the steps of dispersing 

zein in an aqueous solution comprising acetone in an amount 
of from 65 to 75% by volume to form a zein dispersion, 

forming the resulting zein dispersion into a film, and drying 
the film in an atmosphere having a relative humidity of 85% 

or less at an initial temperature of 55°C or less. The 
present invention also relates to a method for imparting 

water resistance to an article with poor water resistance by 
coating the article with the zein dispersion prepared as 

above, and drying the coated zein dispersion under the above 
conditions. The film or coating film according of the 

present invention neither dissolves upon contact with water, 
nor becomes weak due to water absorption or swelling on 

contact with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a 
water-resistant biodegradable film and to application of the 
biodegradable film to a biodegradable but non-water-resistant 
article to render it water-resistant. With the recent increase of consciousness of the 
importance of environmental conservation and environmental 
purification, studies for replacing conventional every-day 
materials with those made of biodegradable materials have 
been conducted on a world-wide scale. Among biodegradable materials which have been 
proposed to date, starch-type naturally-occurring substances 
have poor water resistance; thus, their use is somewhat 
confined from a practical perspective. Imparting water 
resistance to such biodegradable materials would broaden 
their application and furnish solutions to various problems 
confronting the environment, particularly in terms of waste 
disposal. Articles with poor water resistance may be coated to 
waterproof them. In taking this approach, it is required to 
establish a technique for producing with ease a biodegradable 
thin film which exhibits sufficient water resistance so as 
not to absorb water, not to become swollen with water and not  
 
to be weakened even when contacted with water for a long 
time. In particular, films made of a naturally-occurring 
substance which are completely degradable have been 
attracting considerable attention. However, currently available biodegradable films made 
of naturally-occurring substances are strictly limited in 
their use due to their poor water resistance. Therefore, 
such materials are virtually impractical for use as 
containers for foods having a significant water content. ZEIN, a catalogue published by Freeman Industries, 
Inc. discusses zein, a main protein of corn (Zeamays), as a 
coating material. Although zein itself and films of zein 
prepared in a known manner do not dissolve in water, zein and 
films thereof are known to absorb water, and thus become 
weak. Therefore, conventional zein films are not water-resistant 
and find little, if any, practical utility. US-PS-2 397 919 for example discloses a stabilisation of 
solutions of zein in aqueous acetone or aqueous alcohol by 
incorporating therein a small proportion of a water-soluble 
thiocyanate. These solutions may be employed for the preparation 
of threads or filaments as well as for coating various 
surfaces such as cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, JP-A-03 207775 describes zein based films prepared 
from aqueous solutions comprising ethanol.
