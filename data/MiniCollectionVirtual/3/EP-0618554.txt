<ABSTRACT>
A moisture reduction system for an automatic vending 
machine of the hot beverage type which utilizes a movable 

brewing chamber that opens for the addition of product, 
such as coffee. The system has a suction tube disposed 

adjacent the product supply tube and brewing chamber in 
its product fill position, which draws off moisture from 

the open chamber so that it does not accumulate on the 
product supply tube. A filter is disposed at the end of 

the suction tube to prevent product dust, such as coffee 
grounds, from being sucked into the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic vending 
machines and, more particularly, to those designed for 
brewing beverages such as coffee or tea. Automatic 
vending machines containing hot beverage brewers for 
brewing coffee and the like, have always been subject to 
moisture problems because of the use of hot water which, 
at various stages of the process, is open to atmosphere 
within the machine cabinet and therefore introduces steam 
into the cabinet. The presence of this moisture in the 
cabinet causes various problems with different aspects of 
operation and cleanliness of the equipment. One such 
moisture related problem is in the area where the ground 
coffee is introduced into the brewing chamber. Finely ground coffee, whether ground in the machine 
at the time of selection by a customer or preground 
coffee kept in a container, is deposited in the brewing 
chamber through some form of conduit or funnel. When the 
machine is being operated to produce multiple cups of 
coffee, the brewing chamber, when first opened after a 
brewing cycle, contains a substantial amount of hot vapor 
which escapes the brewing chamber in the area of the 
conduit or funnel from which the subsequent charge of 
coffee is coming. The finely ground coffee picks up the 
moisture and a significant amount of the moist coffee 
adheres itself to the outlet opening of the duct or 
funnel, eventually clogging off flow of coffee to the 
chamber if the duct or funnel is not cleaned frequently. 
Since frequent servicing is expensive, it is desirable to 
reduce this clogging effect as much as possible. US-A-2 558 522 discloses a vending machine which tackles the moisture problem by blowing warmair from a delivery tube opening positioned in the brewing chamber. The present invention substantially reduces the 
clogging of the ducts or funnels which pour the ground  
 
coffee and the like into the brewing chamber, by 
withdrawing a substantial amount of moisture from the 
area of the open brewing chamber and the outlets of the 
ducts or funnels, and disposes of accumulated coffee 
grounds in this area which might otherwise cause 
clogging. These advantages are achieved through the use 
of a suction tube with an opening disposed adjacent the 
opening in the brewing chamber and the product delivery 
conduit when they are in the position where product is 
being supplied to the brewing chamber. In addition, a 
filter is provided which covers the opening in the 
suction tube and entraps and accumulates the coffee 
grounds entrained in

<CLAIMS>
An automatic vending machine (10) of the beverage 
brewing type, including a moisture reduction system, said 

machine having a brewing chamber (20) with an opening 
through which product is supplied for brewing, a product 

storage container (12, 14) and a product delivery conduit 
(18, 24) for supplying product from the product storage 

container to the opening in the brewing chamber, CHARACTERISED IN THAT the moisture reduction system 
comprises: 


a suction tube (46) having an opening (50) 
disposed adjacent the opening in the brewing chamber and the 

product delivery conduit (18, 24) when product is being 
supplied to the brewing chamber, 
a product filter (58) covering the opening in the 
suction tube, 
means (48) for creating a suction in the tube 
sufficient to draw moisture into the suction tube from 

around the opening in the brewing chamber when product is 
being supplied thereto. 
An automatic vending machine as defined in claim 1 
including means (70) for removing product from the filter 

after each brewing cycle of the brewing chamber. 
An automatic vending machine as defined in claim 1 
or 2, wherein the brewing chamber (20) is mounted for 

movement between a brewing position, a product filling 
position and a product dumping position and the filter and 

suction tube openings are disposed adjacent the product fill 
position. 
An automatic vending machine as defined in claim 3 
including a wiper (70) mounted for movement with the brewing 

chamber and engaging the filter (58) for part of the wiper 
movement sufficient to remove product from the filter.
