<ABSTRACT>
A radiant electric heater, for example for use with a 
glass ceramic top cooker, comprises a support dish (1) 

containing a base layer (2) of thermal and electrical 
insulating material and at least one electrical heating 

element supported by the insulating material. The 
heating element comprises first and second portions 

electrically connected in series for operation, the first 
portion (4) comprising an elongate strip of resistive 

material and the second portion (5) comprising coiled 
bare resistance wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiant electric heaters, 
particularly for use with glass ceramic top cookers. Radiant electric heaters are well known which comprise a 
metal dish, for example of circular, rectangular or oval 
shape, containing a base layer of thermal and electrical 
insulating material supporting one or more electrical 
heating elements. A peripheral wall of insulating material 
is also generally provided in the dish. The most commonly-used form of heating element to date has 
comprised coiled bare resistance wire, the wire generally 
having a circular cross-section and being formed into a 
helical coil. With such wire, which may for example 
comprise an iron-chromium-aluminium alloy, it has been 
possible to select appropriate combinations of the wire 
diameter, the coil diameter, the total length of wire in 
the coil, and the pitch of adjacent turns of the coil, to 
provide one or more heated zones in which the heating 
element produces a required power and heat distribution, 
with adequate operating life expectancy. Such wire coil 
elements are readily adaptable to heaters of different 
sizes and to requirements for different operating voltages 
by appropriate variation of the above parameters.  
 Ongoing trends in radiant heater design have been towards 
the achievement of heaters in which the heat up time to 
full radiance after switching on is as short as possible. 
In this regard it has been found advantageous to use, 
instead of a heating element in the form of coiled wire, an 
element comprising a thin elongate strip or ribbon of a 
metal or metal alloy. This is because the strip or ribbon 
element will have a smaller thermal mass than the 
equivalent element in the form of the coiled wire. In order to design a practical heater, a strip or ribbon of 
corrugated form (sometimes referred to as crinkled, or 
sinuous, or serpentine, or convoluted form) is generally 
adopted in order to accommodate the required length of 
ribbon within the heated zone. However, other 
configurations of strip or ribbon, such as a helical coil, 
may be adopted if desired. As with a heater designed using 
a coiled wire element, a number of parameters of the strip 
or ribbon can be varied in order to achieve the required 
heater performance. These parameters comprise: thickness 
of the strip or ribbon; width of the strip or ribbon; total 
length of the strip or ribbon; and corrugation (or coil) 
pitch and corrugation depth of the strip or ribbon. When an operating voltage is applied, the strip or ribbon
