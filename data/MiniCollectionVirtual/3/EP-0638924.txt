<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed, in the production of film carriers for the tape-automated bonding (TAB) technique, to structure a copper layer (2) with window regions (4). In order to process the plastic film (1) which must likewise have window regions, the structured copper layer (2) is used as a mask. The plastic film (1) is removed by laser processing on the window regions (4) not covered by the copper layer (2). It is expedient to use an excimer laser as the laser.
