<ABSTRACT>
Optical scanning apparatus (1), comprising a linear 
detector array (4), optical imaging means (2) for imaging 

an image to be scanned on the array (4) and scanning means 
for at least substantially perpendicularly shifting, in a 

first operational mode, the image with respect to the array 
(4). By inclining the array (4), the image, in a second 

operational mode, does not shift perpendicularly with 
respect to the array, as a result of which an enhanced 

signal/noise ratio can be simply realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical scanning apparatus
having a direction of sight Z comprising:
a linear detector array provided with a plurality of
detector elements; an imaging arrangement for focusing a beam of light onto
the linear detector array;rotation means for rotating the linear detector array and
the imaging arrangement together around an axis which is
not parallel to the direction of sight Z.Such an apparatus is well-known and finds particular
application in infrared detection equipment.The apparatus according to the invention has for its object
to realize, in a relatively simple, yet inventive way, an
improved signal/noise ratio based on the existing means.
This is possible by, for instance, reducing the scanning
speed. In the majority of cases, however, this is
undesirable. Other possibilities in this respect involve
the incorporation of an increased number of elements per
array length, which however entails considerable cost.The apparatus according to the invention is characterized
in that the detector array is provided with second rotation
means for rotating the detector array from a first position
relating to a first mode of operation to a second position
relating to a second mode of operation, around an axis
which is at least substantially in line with the direction
of sight Z. The advantage of this provision is that the signal/noise
ratio can be improved while retaining the scanning speed
and without introducing any modifications to the detector
and the optical system.It is observed that in the Japanese patent publication
number JP-57035468 a recording device for a facsimile is
disclosed wherein a recording head provided with an array
of detector elements is rotatable around an axis
perpendicular to the scanning direction. In this recording
device the array is turned around a fulcrum for
inclination. However, this recording head is not
appropriate for use in the optical scanning apparatus
according to the invention, since the fulcrum is located at
an extremity of the recording head. When turning this
recording head, the direction of sight Z would also change,
which is undesired.A favourable embodiment of the apparatus is characterized
by a processor for amplifying and time-division
multiplexing electric signals generated by each detector
element of the linear detector array, the processor
comprising per detector element adjustable delay means for
compensating relative time delays of electric signals from
each element of the linear detector array when the scanning
apparatus is in the
