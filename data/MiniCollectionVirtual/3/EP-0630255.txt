<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to complexes consisting essentially of an isolated MHC component and an antigenic peptide associated with the antigen binding site of the MHC component. These complexes are useful in treating deletrious immune responses, such as autoimmunity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the methods and
compositions for the modulation of T cell function in the
treatment of for example, autoimmune diseases, allergic
responses, transplant rejection, and other immunological
disorders. In particular, it concerns complexes which target
helper T cells by using a complex of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins with peptides
representing fragments of antigens associated with such
diseases. These complexes can be further conjugated to
radioisotopes or other labels for diagnostic purposes, or to
toxins or other substances which render the complexes
therapeutically useful.A number of pathological responses involving
unwanted T cell activation are known. For instance, a number
of allergic diseases, have been associated with particular
MHC alleles or suspected of having an autoimmune component.Other deleterious T cell-mediated responses include
the destruction of foreign cells that are purposely
introduced into the body as grafts or transplants from
allogeneic hosts. This process, known as "allograft
rejection," involves the interaction of host T cells with
foreign MHC molecules. Quite often, a broad range of MHC
alleles are involved in the response of the host to an
allograft.Autoimmune disease is a particularly important
class of deleterious immune response. In autoimmune
diseases, self-tolerance is lost and the immune system
attacks "self" tissue as if it were a foreign target. More
than 30 autoimmune diseases are presently known; these
include many which have received much public attention, 
including myasthenia gravis (MG) and multiple sclerosis (MS).A crude approach to treating autoimmune disease and
other immunopathologies is general immunosuppression. This
has the obvious disadvantage of crippling the ability of the
subject to respond to real foreign materials to which it
needs to mount an immune response. An only slightly more
sophisticated approach relies on the removal of antibodies or
immune complexes involving the target tissue. This also has
adverse side effects, and is difficult to accomplish. The
invention approach, described in detail below, relies on a
"clonotypic" reagent--i.e., a reagent which attacks only the
cells of the immune system which are responsive to the
autoantigen.In the general paradigm now considered to describe
the immune response, specific antigens presented result in a
clonal expansion, as first proposed by Burnet in 1959.
According to this scenario, a particular subject will have
hundreds of thousands of T and B cells

is recognized by an autoreactive T cell 
associated with
multiple sclerosis.
A complex of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of
residues 84-102 of human MBP.
A complex of claim 1, wherein the MHC component is Class
II MHC.
