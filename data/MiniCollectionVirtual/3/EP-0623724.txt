<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a panel for so-called 
sectional doors, in which a number of panels are hinged 

together by means of hinge parts which form part of the 
panel. Each panel consists of an elongated body part, 

which is formed by two side plates (2,2';30,30') lying a 
distance apart and along the long narrow sides contains 

the hinge parts (3,4) for forming the hinged connection. 
One hinge part (3) contains an arc-shaped nose, the arc-shaped 

outside wall (12) of which connects virtually 
directly to one side wall (8) of the body part, and the 

inside wall (13) running concentrically herewith merges 
through an acute angle into the other side wall (7) of the 

body part. The other hinge part (4) has a supporting part 
lying near one side wall (7') of the body part and bearing an 

essentially cylindrical thickened part (14), and a 
concentric wall (17) running at a distance therefrom 

which with the thickened part leaves a space free for the 
accommodation of the nose of the other hinge part of an 

adjacent panel. This concentric wall extends from the 
foot of the supporting part to the other side wall (8') of the 

body part and merges through an acute angle into said 
wall. Through this shape of the hinge parts, a hinged 

connection which is safe for fingers is obtained between 
the panels. 
The invention also relates to a section hinge 
consisting of two section parts, the shape of which 

corresponds essentially to the above-described hinge 
parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panel according to the preamble of Claim 1.Such a panel is used for, for example, vertically movable articulated garage
doors, but can equally be used for horizontally movable articulated doors, which are also
known as sectional doors, and in the case of which the adjacent panels have to be able to
carry out a specific mutual rotation in order to be able to move the door through an angle of
for example, 90Â°. A panel of this type is known, for example from EP-A-0 159 058.A major disadvantage of this known panel is that when the panels are rotated
relative to each other a gap-shaped space is produced between the adjacent panels, which
gap closes when the adjacent panels are returned to lie in a common plane. Such a gap
means that, particularly in the case of horizontally moving doors, there is a risk of putting
one's fingers into the opening and closing gap, and of the fingers becoming trapped, with the
serious consequences which this can entail.Sectional doors with so-called finger protection are currently known. These
doors are generally made of panels whose narrow long sides are formed in such a way that
the gap arising is too small to be a hazard. The panels in this case are connected to each
other by separate hinges. Such doors are complex and are time-consuming to fit.From AT-B-382 423 a sectional door is known in which the panels are
connected by hinge parts and the gap between the adjacent panels has been widened so as to
prevent that the fingers of the user become pinched in between them. The disadvantage of
this construction is that the adjacent panels have a considerable distance between them.The object of the present invention is then to provide a panel with hinge
incorporated therein, which panel is simple in design, and in the case of which the adjacent
panels can pivot relative to each other without the risk of fingers becoming trapped between
the panels. These objects are achieved according to the invention by a panel which has the
features described in Claim 1. Due to the fact that the arc-shaped external surface of the nose and
the arc-shaped wall of the other hinge part interacting therewith both continue virtually to
the respective side walls of the panel, no opening and closing gap is now produced when the
adjacent panels rotate relative to each other, or in any case the gap is too small for there to
be a risk of fingers becoming trapped in it. The shape of the hinge parts therefore provides
the desired finger protection, on the one hand, and a

Panel (1, 1'), in particular for forming a garage door or the like, comprising an elongated
body part having two flat parallel side walls (2, 2'; 30, 30'), first and second long narrow

sides, a first hinge part (4) on said first long narrow side and a second hinge part on said
second long narrow side, said both hinge parts extending over the length of the panel,

said second hinge part having an arc-shaped nose with an arc-shaped outside wall (12)
and a coaxial with said outside wall extending arc-shaped inside wall (13), said first

hinge part having an arc-shaped thickened part (14) to define a hinge pin, said thickened
part being disposed on a supporting part (15, 16), said supporting part adjoining a one

side wall (2, 30) of the body part and said first hinge part further having a first arc-shaped
wall (17), extending from the base of said supporting part and being spaced from said

thickened part and coaxial therewith to define therewith a space to accommodate said
nose of the second hinge part on a adjacent body panel such that said nose can grip

around said thickened part to form a hinged connection between adjacent body panels,
and the large side walls of the body part being formed by two essential flat parallel

plates (2, 2'; 30, 30') lying at a distance from each other, and with the space between
them filled up with a foam plastic, 
characterised in that
 said arc-shaped wall (17) of
the first hinge part extends from the base of said supporting portion (15, 16) to said other

side wall (2', 30') of the body part and merging to a rounded acute angle into said other
side wall and in that the arc-shaped outside wall (12) of the nose of the second hinge part

extends from the other side wall (2', 30') of the body part and the arc-shaped inside wall
(13) of said nose ends at the one side wall (2, 30) of the body part and merges into said

one side wall.
Panel according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the side walls of the panel are formed
by two parallel plates (30, 30') having a flat body part, said plates each integrally

including at their respective long sides a portion of the respective hinge parts, one plate 
(30') at one side containing the arc-shaped outside wall (12) of the nose, which wall ends

with a connecting edge (33) running inwards parallel to the plane of the body part of the
plate, and at the other side bearing the arc-shaped wall (17) with the inside wall (16) of

the supporting part, which inside wall ends with a slanting connecting edge (32), while
the other plate (30) of the body part at one side contains the inside wall (13) of the nose

and ends with a connecting edge (31) extending parallel to the flat body part of said plate,
and at the other side contains the inward-slanting wall (15) of the supporting part and the

thickened part (14) in the form of a bead.
Panel according to claims 2 
characterised in that
 the outside wall of the nose near the
transition to the flat body part is provided with a longitudinal recess (34) for the

accommodation of a sealing strip.
Panel according to the preceding claims 1-3, 
characterised in that

past a plane (14a) passing through the axis (14') of the thickened part and at right angles
to the side walls of the panel.
Panel according to the preceding claims 1-4, 
characterised in that
 the outside wall (12)
of the nose of the second hinge part is provided with a sealing strip (20) near the merging

Panel according to one or more of the preceding claims 1 - 6,
