<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new hybrid
propulsion system for vehicles, namely a system
comprising at least a heat engine and an electric motor,
in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.The hybrid systems proposed hitherto can be
divided in two main categories:
a) series hybrid vehicles, in which all the
power necessary for traction is supplied by the electric
motor, powered both by batteries, in turn charged by a
generator actuated by the heat engine, and directly by
the generator itself. The heat engine in this case is
dimensioned so as to supply the mean power used, while
the electric motor must be able to supply the power and
the torque required in all the situations in which the
vehicle is used. A speed-changing unit is generally
required, since the entire operating range cannot be
covered by the starting torque and maximum power
characteristics of current electric motors.
The situation as regards the emissions of the
heat engine is favourable with reference to a test cycle
since the heat engine operates within a fixed speed
range, and therefore without transients, and moreover
supplies a limited power. The situation is less
advantageous at a constant speed; in fact, the emissions
as well as the consumption levels are penalized by the
efficiency of the electric drive, which is less than that
of a mechanical drive.b) parallel hybrid vehicles, in which both the
electric motor and the heat engine may be coupled
alternately or simultaneously to the transmission of the
vehicle. The electric motor is in this case smaller than
that used in a series hybrid vehicle, but the heat engine
must frequently adapt its operation to the speed
variations of the vehicle, thus partly losing the 
advantage of a reduction in emissions, which is precisely
that of the series hybrid solution. Furthermore a speed-changing
unit is essential. Control of the speed-changing
unit as well as activation and deactivation of
the engine and motor and adjustment of their load is very
complex.A complete overview of the state of the art
relating to hybrid propulsion systems is contained in
A.F. Burke's "Hybrid/Electric Vehicle Design Options and
Evaluations", SAE 920447.From DE-A-25 10 623 a hybrid propulsion system
is known with an internal combustion engine combined with
an electric machine. The output of the two machines are
combined via an epicyclic gearing. The electric machine
works alternately as a generator or as a motor, depending
on the operative conditions of the vehicle. The energy
produced by the electric machine
