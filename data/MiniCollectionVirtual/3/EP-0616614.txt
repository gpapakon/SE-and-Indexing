<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR INHIBITING ELASTASEThroughout this application various publications are referenced. The citations are provided immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.TECHNICAL FIELD BACKGROUND ARTαl Antitrypsin (AAT) is a 52 kDa plasma serine protease inhibitor. Its normal plasma concentration ranges from 150 to 350 mg/dl (Brantly et al., 1988), although it behaves as an acute phase reactant increasing 3-4-fold during host response to inflammation and/or tissue injury such as with pregnancy, acute infection, tumors, estrogen, and typhoid vaccine (Kushner, 1988;Schreiber, 1987) . AAT is capable of inhibiting a variety of proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, thrombin, kallikrein, factor Xa, plasmogen and cathepsin G (Carrel et al., 1986; Laurell & Jeppson 1975; Travis & Salvesen, 1983), but its main physiological role is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is not only capable of attacking elastin but may also cleave other connective tissue proteins, such as type I, III, and IV collagens, the protein portion of proteoglycans, and laminin (Bieth, 1986) . AAT, however, prevents such degradation by forming a tightly bound 1:1 enzyme:inhibitor complex resulting in the slow proteolytic cleavage of the reactive center of the inhibitor between MET-358 and SER-359 of AAT.The reactive center of human AAT is contained within an exposed peptide from (ALA-350) to (SER-359) in a stressed loop configuration (Carrell, 1986; Bruch et al.. 

 1988) , which may be comparable to the bait region of α-2- macroglobulin (S-Jensen, 1987) . Every serine proteinase so far examined, including bacterial, plant, and reptilian as well as mammalian enzymes, has been reported to disrupt bonds within this loop of the native inhibitor. Cathepsin L (Johnson et al., 1986) and Serratia marcescens metalloproteinase (Virca et al. , 1982), for example, have been reported to cleave the peptide bond between MET-358 and SER-359, while Pseudomonas aeruqinosa (Morihara et al., 1984), macrophage elastase (Banda et al., 1985) and PNM collagenase (Knauper et al., 1990) have been reported to cleave one amino acid residue N-terminal at the peptide bond between PRO-357 and MET-358. Cathepsin L (Johnson et al., 1986) and staphyloσoccus aureus cysteine and serine proteinase (Potempa et al. , 1986) have also been
