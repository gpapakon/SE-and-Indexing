<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor 
device having a crystalline silicon semiconductor 

layer comprises the steps of heat crystallizing an 
amorphous silicon semiconductor layer (12) at a 

relatively low temperature because of the use of a 
crystallization promoting material such as Ni, Pd, 

Pt, Cu, AG, Au, In, Sn, Pb, P, As, and Sb. 
The crystallization promoting material is introduced 

by mixing it within a liquid precursor material for 
forming silicon oxide (13) and coating the precursor 

material onto the amorphous silicon film (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture
of semiconductor devices and particularly, though not
exclusively relates to the manufacture of thin film
transistors (TFT) as are used in integrated circuits,
for example as switching elements in an active matrix
circuit in an electro-optical device or as a driving
circuit thereof formed on the same substrate as the
active matrix circuit.An amorphous silicon film can be utilized most
readily as the thin film semiconductor for a TFT.
However, the electric characteristics of amorphous
silicon film are poorer than those of crystalline thin
film semiconductors such as, for example,
polycrystalline silicon, single crystalline silicon
and microcrystalline silicon.A crystalline silicon film can be prepared by
first forming an amorphous silicon film, and then heat
treating the resulting film to effect crystallization
of the same, but the heat treatment of the amorphous
silicon film requires the film to be heated at a
temperature of 600°C or higher for a duration of 10 
hours or longer and this is detrimental for glass
substrates. For instance, Corning 7059 glass which is
commonly used for the substrates of active matrix
liquid crystal display devices has a glass distortion
point of 593°C, and is therefore not suitable for large
area substrates that have to be subjected to heating
at a temperature of 600°C or higher.The inventors of the present invention have found
that the crystallization of an amorphous silicon film
can be effected by heating the film at 550°C for a
duration of about 4 hours if a trace amount of nickel
or palladium, or other elements such as lead, is
introduced into the surface of the amorphous silicon
film. Such elements (hereinafter referred to as
"catalyst elements capable of promoting the
crystallization of an amorphous silicon film" or
simply as "catalyst elements") can be introduced to
the surface of the amorphous silicon film by plasma
treatment or by ion implantation for example. Plasma
treatment is effected in a plasma CVD apparatus in
which the catalyst elements are added into the
amorphous silicon film by generating a plasma in an
atmosphere such as of gaseous hydrogen or nitrogen
using an electrode containing the catalyst elements.US-A-5 147 826 describes a method using a thermal
evaporation to deposit a thin layer of palladium or nickel.However, the presence of such catalyst elements
in large quantity in semiconductor materials is not 
preferred, because the use of such semiconductor
materials in semiconductor devices greatly
