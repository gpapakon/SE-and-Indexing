<ABSTRACT>
For providing a moisture, draught and noise seal between 
an electrical cable, or bundle (6) of individual 

electrical wires, where the cable or bundle passes through 
an aperture (5) in a wall (2), such as a bulkhead between 

the engine and passenger compartments (3,4) of a vehicle 
body, a substantially rigid casing (8), made of two 

separate and hinged parts (10,12), is fitted over the 
cable or bundle (6). A sealing ring (30) seals one end of 

the hollow cavity thus formed. The cavity is then filled 
with low-melting point material (32), such as 

polyurethane. This material fills the cavity within the 
casing (8), and also fills the interstices between the 

individual wires of the bundle (6). The material (32) 
then solidifies. The casing (8) is then sealingly 

attached around the periphery of the aperture (5), such as 
by means of fixtures passing through holes (36,38) in 

flanges (22,24) and through corresponding apertures in a 
sealing ring (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sealing arrangements and 
methods. In an embodiment of the invention to be 
described, a sealing arrangement is provided for sealing 
around an electrical cable, or a bundle of electrical 
wires, where the cable or bundle passes through a dividing 
wall or panel. According to the invention, there is provided a sealing 
arrangement for sealing around an elongate member passing 
through an aperture in wall means, comprising casing means 
adapted to be placed around a portion of the length of the 
elongate member adjacent the part thereof to pass through 
the aperture, the casing having two ends and defining a 
hollow cavity surrounding the said portion of the elongate 
member and sealed to the periphery thereof at one said 
end, the hollow cavity being filled with material 
sufficiently fluid so as to provide a seal between the 
inside of the casing and the elongate member, and means 
for sealingly attaching the other said end of the casing 
to the wall means around the aperture. According to the invention, there is further provided a 
method of sealing a bundle of individually insulated 
electrical wires or conductors to wall means through an  
 
aperture in which the bundle passes, comprising the steps 
of providing a hollow cavity around a portion of the 
length of the bundle adjacent the part thereof which 
passes through the wall means, the cavity having one end 
sealed to the outside of the bundle, warming predetermined 
material to render it fluid but to less than the 
temperature at which damage occurs to the wires or 
conductors, flowing the fluid material into the hollow 
cavity through the other end thereof so that it 
substantially fills the cavity and flows into the 
interstices between the individual wires or conductors and 
solidifies therein and in the said cavity, and sealingly 
connecting the other end of the hollow cavity to the wall 
means around the said aperture. A sealing arrangement embodying the invention, and a 
sealing method according to the invention, for sealing 
around an electrical cable or bundle of electrical wires 
where the cable or bundle passes through a dividing wall 
or panel, will now be described, by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings 
in which: 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross-section through one of 
the sealing arrangements;  Figure 2 is a cross-section on the line II-II of Figure 1; Figure 3 is an end view of part of the sealing arrangement 
of Figure 1; and Figure 4 is a diagrammatic

1. A sealing arrangement for sealing around an elongate 
member (6) passing through an aperture (5) in wall means 

(2), characterised by casing means (8) adapted to be 
placed around a portion of the length of the elongate 

member (6) adjacent the part thereof to pass through the 
aperture (5), the casing means (8) having two ends and 

defining a hollow cavity surrounding the said portion of 
the elongate member (6) and sealed to the periphery 

thereof at one said end (18,20), the hollow cavity being 
filled with material (32) sufficiently fluid so as to 

provide a seal between the inside of the casing means (8) 
and the elongate member (6), and means (26,28) for 

sealingly attaching the other said end of the casing means 
(8) to the wall means (2) around the aperture (5). 
2. A sealing arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the material (32) is rendered 

sufficiently fluid by warming to a temperature less than 
the temperature at which damage will occur to the elongate 

member (6). 
3. A sealing arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, for 
use where the elongate member (6) comprises a bundle of 

individual elongate elements, characterised in that the 
 

fluid material (32) additionally provides a seal between 
the individual elongate elements in the bundle. 
4. A sealing arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the individual elongate elements are 

individual electrically insulated flexible wires or 
conductors together forming the said bundle. 
5. A sealing arrangement according to any preceding 

claim, characterised in that the said material is 
polyurethane (32). 
6. A sealing arrangement according to any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the casing means (8) 

comprises two casing parts (10,12) which are flexibly 
interconnected (14) to enable them to be hinged apart to 

be placed over the elongate member (6) and then hinged 
together to define the hollow cavity. 
7. A sealing arrangement according to any preceding
