<ABSTRACT>
A bi-CMOS circuit has an emitter-coupled logic 
circuit (11) responsive to an input signal (Vin) for producing a 

logic signal (X) and the complementary logic signal (CX), 
an emitter follower (Q14) responsive to the logic signal (X) 

for changing the voltage level at the emitter node (N12) 
thereof and a switching circuit (Qp3/Qn3) coupled between 

the emitter follower (Q14) and a negative power voltage line 
and responsive to the complementary logic signal (CX) for 

selectively coupling the emitter node (N12) and the negative 
power voltage line with an output node (N13) of the bi-CMOS 

circuit so that through-current does not flow through the 
switching circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a logic circuit and, more
particularly, to a logic circuit implemented by a
combination of bipolar transistors and a complementary
inverter (which is hereinbelow referred to as "bi-CMOS
circuit").A typical example of the bi-CMOS circuit is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Publication of Unexamined Application
(Kokai) No. 59-263918, and is illustrated in figure 1 of
the drawings. The prior art bi-CMOS circuit largely
comprises an emitter coupled logic circuit 1 for inverting
an input signal Vin and a level-shift circuit 2 for
producing an output signal Vout.The emitter coupled logic circuit 1 comprises a
differential section 1a responsive to an input signal Vin
for producing a high-impedance signal X and the high-impedance
complementary signal CX and a buffer section 1b
for producing a low-impedance signal Y and the low-impedance
complementary signal CY, and the level-shift
circuit 2 is responsive to the low-impedance signal Y and 
the low-impedance complementary signal CY for producing the
output logic signal Vout.The differential section 1a comprises a series
combination of a resistor R1 and a bipolar transistor Q1
coupled between a ground voltage line and a common node N1,
a series combination of a resistor R2 and a bipolar
transistor Q2 also coupled between the ground voltage line
and the common node N1 and a series combination of a
bipolar transistor Q3 and a resistor R3 coupled between the
common node N1 and a first negative voltage line Vee1. The
input signal Vin is supplied to the base node of the
bipolar transistor Q1, and the bipolar transistor Q2 is
biased with a reference voltage signal Vr. The bipolar
transistor Q3 is appropriately biased with a negative bias
voltage Vb so that the bipolar transistor Q3 and the
resistor R3 serve as a constant current source.The bipolar transistor Q1 turns on and off depending
upon the voltage level of the input signal Vin, and the
constant current source, i.e., the series of bipolar
transistor Q3 and the resistor R3 causes the bipolar
transistor Q2 to complementarily turn off and on. For this
reason, the voltage levels at the collector nodes C1 and C2
are varied with the input signal Vin, and the high-impedance 
signal X and the high-impedance complementary
signal CX are produced from the input signal Vin.The buffer section 1b comprises a series combination
of bipolar transistors Q4 and Q5 and a resistor R4 coupled
between the ground voltage line and the first negative
voltage line Vee1 and a series combination of bipolar
transistors Q6
