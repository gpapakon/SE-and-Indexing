<ABSTRACT>
A glass mat reinforced thermoplastic semi-finished 
sheet material comprising thermoplastic resin 

and at least two needled continuous and/or chopped glass 
fibre strand mats is disclosed as well as a method for 

its manufacturing and its use. Each of said glass mats is 
needled from the two sides in an asymmetrical way, so 

that the number of fibre ends protruding from the two major 
mat surfaces are practically the same, but the length 

of said fibre ends protruding from the first major surface 
is substantially longer than the length of the fibre 

ends protruding from the second opposite major surface. 
Said glass mats are impregnated with thermoplastic resin, 

having either their first major surfaces directed towards 
the outside surface of said thermoplastic sheet, for maximum 

mouldability, or having their second major surfaces 
directed towards the outside surface of said thermoplastic 

sheet, for maximum surface quality of the moulded 
part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fibre reinforced
sheet thermoplastic composites, in particular to glass
mat reinforced thermoplastic semi-finished sheet material
(GMT). These thermoplastic composite materials are increasingly
replacing steel and thermoset resin based composites
in a wide range of applications, such as automotive
parts. Typical examples are noise shields, battery
trays, seat structures, bumper beams, dashboard supports
and front end panels.Processing of the semi-finished sheet material
to finished parts is done by hot flow moulding
("stamping") whereby the material is first subjected to
heat and then to pressure. Pre-cut blanks are generally
pre-heated to well above the melting point of the thermoplastic
resin. Shaping is done in a cold mould using a
fast closing press in order to press the material into
the extremities of the mould cavity.Complex shapes, including deep thin ribs, undercuts
etc. can be realized, but require a good balance
between the mobility of the glass mat and the flowability
of the thermoplastic resin.Glass mats are typically prepared by mechanical
bonding of endless and/or chopped glass fibre strands
in a needling machine, but staple fibres can also be
used. Needling comprises puncturing the continuous and/or
chopped glass fibre strands with a large number of barbed
needles in order to mechanically bond the glass fibre
strands and bring about a certain level of integrity,
which allows the glass mats to be handled for further
processing. At the same time, the glass fibre strand will
be partly split into single filaments and a part of the
glass fibre strands is broken. This allows the needling
process to be tailored to control the average glass fibre
length and the glass mat mobility. The properties of the glass mats are important
to the performance of the semi-finished composite
sheet made thereof, in particular to the flowability of
the semi-finished composite sheet and the surface aspect
of the finished part with respect to the visibility of
the glass fibres on the surface of the moulded part. The
fibre ends protruding from the two major surfaces of each
glass fibre strand mat are recognized to be a significant
factor influencing the properties of the glass mat.Such fibre ends protruding from the surface
of the glass fibre strand mats are often referred to as
"spikes". In general, the number of spikes on the surface
of the glass mat can be increased by adjusting the puncturing
frequency and/or the glass mat line speed to increase
the number of punctures per unit of
