<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a system and method for 
compensating for offset and gain drift in a fast scan direc
tion during an 
image forming process. To achieve compensation, the present invention 

samples a plurality of permanently darkened pixels upon powering up 
image sensors and circuitry therefor and during a sub-scanning process of 

an image and feeds this information into an offset value generating circuit. 
The offset generating circuit continually adjusts a pixel offset voltage 

according to a difference between sequential samples of the permanently 
darkened pixel, thereby compensating for fast scan offset drift. The 

present invention also samples a plurality of active pixels during a scanning 
of a calibration strip. From this scan, a gain corrective value is calculated. 

The present invention then samples active pixels during a scanning of a 
platen background. In response to this sampling, the gain corrective value 

is continually adjusted according to a difference between sequential 
samples of the platen background, thereby compensating for fast scan gain 

drift. The present invention can also compensate and balance transfer 
functions for a plurality of communication channels in a multi-channel 

system by using the same target values and same reference signals for each 
channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, generally, is directed to a device for 
compensating offset and gain drift present in the communication of 
electronic data, and particularly, in the communication of image data in an 
image processing apparatus. A problem prevalent in the communication of electronic data, 
especially, image or video data, is offset drift and gain drift. Offset and 
gain drift can be caused by the characteristics of individual components 
responsible for processing or communicating the image data; i.e., a shift 
register functioning as a buffer for the signals received from a charged 
coupled device (CCD) may have inherent offset and gain characteristics 
unique to itself or a scanner may contribute to offset and gain drift due to 
the present operating conditions; i.e., the operating temperature, light 
temperature, age, etc. Moreover, offset and gain drift may be attributed to 
the individual characteristics of the channel transporting the data from one 
component to another during the processing cycle. If offset drift or gain 
drift is not adequately addressed; i.e., the signal being processed is not 
adjusted to counteract the offset or gain drift; the processing of the signal 
will not be accurate which, in an image processing system, can cause the 
generated picture or image to have a lower quality. In systems employing image viewing devices, such as charge 
coupled devices (CCDs), for viewing by raster scanning an original, the 
output signal produced by the CCD includes a potential attributable to the 
inherent operating characteristics of the CCD. To restore the image output 
signal of the CCD to a true or absolute value, the potential derived from the 
CCD, referred to as the offset potential or signal, must be removed from the 
image signal. However, if the offset signal that is removed is greater or less 
than the actual offset signal, a noticeable aberration or distortion in the 
image output signal may result. Since the operating characteristics of a 
CCD often vary widely from one CCD to another and even vary from time to 
time for the same CCD or for different integration rates, the accurate  
 
determination of the offset signal to be removed is often difficult. The 
problem is further complicated in systems where multiple CCDs are 
employed. Operating systems utilizing the afore-mentioned image viewing 
devices are designed for a fixed image signal gain. However, since the 
operating characteristics of an individual CCD in an imaging device may 
vary, the signal gain may vary
