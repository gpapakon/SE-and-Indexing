<ABSTRACT>
The flower presser has dry sheets (2) coated or impregnated with a desiccant 
and contained in a holder case (3) made of a damp-proof flexible material 

and openable at the upper end. The opening of the holder case (3) is closed 
in an airtight manner by a fastener (5) so that a flower or flowers in contact 

with the dry sheets (2) in the holder case (3) can readily be pressed and 
dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flower presser for 
pressing, drying, and storing flowers or herbs which have 
been picked and collected. It is known that a flower(s) to be stored in dryness is 
inserted between an urethane mat and a paper sheet and 
placed on a wire netting under which an amount of a dehydrating 
agent (namely, silica gel) is distributed, and a 
weight, e.g. books, is loaded over to press down the flower. For the purpose, the urethane mat, the paper sheet, the 
wire netting, and the dehydrating agent all have to be 
available at hand and associated in a layer arrangement with 
generous labour. Also, the flower inserted between the urethane mat and 
the paper sheet is spaced from the dehydrating agent and 
will be dried out after a considerable length of time. The 
dehydrating agent remains exposed to the ambient air during 
the pressing and causes the flower to be dried imperfectly, 
whereby the colors of the dried flower will fade promptly. It is also known, from EP-A-0 342 248, a method for 
drying flowers, and a desiccating unit, which function 
under the effect of pressure and in humidity-controlled atmosphere. It would be desirable to be able for elimination 
of the foregoing disadvantages, to provide a flower 
presser in which a flower(s) to be stored in dryness can 
easily be set in position without labouring for the layer  
 
arrangement, pressed, and dried at high efficiency within a short 
time so that, after being pressed and dried out, it remains 
intact with minimal color fading. In one aspest the present invention provides a flower 
presser comprising: one, two, or more dry sheets coated or 
saturated with a desiccant; a holder case made of a damp-proof 
flexible material and having an opening in an upper end thereof, 
for containing the dry sheet(s) therein; and a fastener provided 
adjacent to the opening of the holder case so that it can close 
the opening to seal the holder case. In another aspect the invention provides a flower presser in 
which the fastener is detachably mounted on the holder case for 
closing the opening. The invention will be described further, by way of example 
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2-2 of

<CLAIMS>
A flower presser comprising: 

at least one dry sheet (2;2A) coated or impregnated with a 
desiccant; characterised by: 
a holder case (3;3A) for containing the dry sheet(s) (2;2A), 
the holder case being made of a damp-proof flexible material and 

having an end which is openable to provide an opening for passage 
of the dry sheet(s) therethrough; and 
a fastener (5;26) for closing the opening to seal the holder 
case (3;3A). 
A flower presser as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dry 
sheet (2;2A) comprises one or more sheets of paper or 

non-flammable fabric coated or impregnated with the desiccant. 
A flower presser as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dry 
sheet (2A) comprises a base (13) coated or impregnated with the 

desiccant and a cushion layer (14) attached to and substantially 
covering at least one side of the base (13). 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
including a cover binder (18) for holding the dry sheet (2) so 

that a flower or flowers (9A) pressed and dried on the dry sheet 
(2) can visibly be stored. 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the holder case (3;3A) is made of a transparent or 

translucent material, at least on one side. 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the holder case (3) contains a deoxidant (19). 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which the fastener (26) is detachably mountable on the holder 

case (3A). 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the holder case (3A) is provided with a check valve (22) 

for allowing discharge of air from the holder case and 
restricting entrance of air into the same. 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the holder case (3A) is provided with a nozzle (22) 

through which air in the holder case is removable by suction.  
 
A flower presser as claimed in any preceding claim, 
including two or more dry sheets (3;3A).
