<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet apparatus includes a plurality of ink 
chambers (4) each having a front end and a rear end, a 

manifold (18) provided to introduce ink into each ink chamber (4) 
with a front side surface on a side near the front end of 

each ink chamber (4), and a nozzle provided at the front end 
of each ink chamber (4). Ink is jetted from the nozzle by 

applying pressure to the ink contained in each ink 
chamber (4). A position of the manifold (18) is such that a 

distance between the front side surface of the manifold (18) 
and the rear end of each ink chamber is set to 0.2mm or 

more, and a distance between the front side surface of the 
manifold (18) and the nozzle is set to 3mm or more. 

Accordingly, pressure necessary for jetting ink droplets 
can be maintained for a relatively long period of time. 

Therefore, the ink can be smoothly introduced from the 
manifold (18) into each ink chamber (4), thereby improving print 

quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet apparatus
that prints by ejecting ink droplets under pressure from
nozzles.Traditional impact printers are now being replaced
with non-impact printers, and the market of the non-impact
printers is being expanded. One known kind of
non-impact printers is an ink jet printer simple in principle
and that can easily effect multi-scale or color printing.
Of all of the types of ink jet printers, a drop-on-demand
type ink jet printer capable of jetting ink droplets
at a required time during printing has rapidly spread
owing to its good jetting efficiency and its low running
cost.Typical examples of such drop-on-demand type ink
jet printers, are a Kaiser type disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication No. Sho 53-12138 and a thermal jet
type disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho
61-59914, for example. However, the former is hard to
reduce in size, and the latter is required to have a high
heat resistance of ink because the ink undergoes a high
temperature. Thus, both types have very severe problems
in application.To solve the above problems, there has been a
newly proposed shear mode type disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,887,100, for example.Fig. 16 shows a shear mode type ink jet apparatus
1 in the prior art. As shown in Fig. 16, the ink jet apparatus
1 is constructed of a piezoelectric ceramics plate
2, a cover plate 10, a nozzle plate 14, and a substrate
41.The piezoelectric ceramics plate 2 is provided with
a plurality of grooves 3 by grinding with use of a diamond
blade or the like. Accordingly, a plurality of side
walls 6 extend along the grooves 3 in such a manner
that each side wall 6 is formed between adjacent ones
of the grooves 3. Each side wall 6 is polarized in a direction
indicated by an arrow 5. All the grooves 3 have the
same depth, and they are parallel to each other. The
depth of each groove 3 is gradually reduced as it
approaches a rear end surface 15 of the piezoelectric
ceramics plate 2 to form a shallow groove 7 near the
rear end surface 15. A pair of metal electrodes 8 are
formed on opposed side surfaces of each groove 3 at an
upper half portion thereof by sputtering or the like. Further,
a metal electrode 9 is formed on opposed side surfaces
and a bottom surface of each shallow groove 7 by
sputtering or the like. The pair of metal electrodes 8
formed on the opposed side surfaces of each groove 3
are connected with the metal electrode 9 formed on the
opposed side surfaces and the bottom surface of the
corresponding shallow groove 7
