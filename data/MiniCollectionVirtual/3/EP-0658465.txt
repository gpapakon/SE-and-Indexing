<ABSTRACT>
A self-steering, three-axle bogie for a railway vehicle is proposed, the two outer wheel sets (3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11) being coupled to one another in opposite directions by means of connecting rods (20 to 23) and connecting bars (16, 17) which pivot about pivot axes (18, 19) which are fixed with respect to the bogie frame (2, 2'). The two connecting bars (16, 17) have central levers (32, 33) whose ends are connected to one another via a longitudinally displaceable joint (34). One of these central levers (33) is connected to the central wheel set (5, 6, 10) in an articulated fashion by means of a connecting rod (37).

<CLAIMS>
Self-steering, three-axle bogie for a railway
vehicle, having a bogie frame consisting of parallel

longitudinal members (2) and at least one cross member
(2'), wheel-set bearings (3 to 8) of the three axles (9

to 11) being fastened to the longitudinal members via
wheel-set springs, the two outer wheel sets (3, 4, 9, 7,

8, 11) being coupled to one another in an opposed manner
via guide links (20 to 23) and steering beams (16, 17),

which pivot centrally about pivot axes (18, 19) fixed
with respect to the bogie frame (2, 2'), and the centre

wheel set being movable transversely to the direction of
travel of the vehicle, characterized in that the two

steering beams (16, 17) have central levers (32, 33)
which run in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle

and whose ends are connected to one another via a
longitudinally displaceable joint (34), and in that one

of these central levers (33) is connected in an articulated
manner to the centre wheel (5, 6, 10) set via a

guide link (37).
Bogie according to Claim 1, characterized in that
one of the central levers (33) is connected in an

articulated manner via a guide link (37) to the housing
of the drive motor (14), mounted on the wheel-set shaft,

of the centre wheel set (5, 6, 10).
Bogie according to Claim 1 and/or Claim 2,
characterized in that an active actuator - preferably a

control cylinder (41) - effective transversely to the
direction of travel of the vehicle is provided between

centre wheel set (5, 6, 10) and bogie (1), which actuator 
is activated as a function of the centrifugal force in

such a way that the centre wheel set is additionally
pushed or pulled toward the outside of the curve.
Bogie according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that an active actuator - preferably a

control cylinder (41') - effective transversely to the
direction of travel of the vehicle is provided between

centre wheel set (5, 6, 10) and vehicle body (45), which
actuator is activated as a function of the centrifugal

force and/or the curve radius in such a way that the
vehicle body is pushed or pulled toward the centre of the

curve and the centre wheel set is pushed or pulled toward
the outside of the curve.
Bogie according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the guide link (37) has clearance

in at least one of its joints (35 and/or 36).
