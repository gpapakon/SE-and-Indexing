<ABSTRACT>
Method for carrying out the restitching of the tip of a manufactured tubular knitted product, particularly the closing of the toe of a sock, comprising the initial phase of producing a sock (5) finishing on the side of the toe (51) remaining open, said method comprising the following operating phases: - moving away the plate (10); - raising the knitting needles (2), with the sinkers (3) closed; raising the said knitting needles (2) once again, with the sinkers (3) open, until the stitches (4) are arranged above the nose (30) of the sinkers (3); - picking up the said stiches (4) and retaining them; - lowering the needles (2); - transferring the sock (5) out of the textile head of the machine (1) at a predetermined distance from the latter; - overturning the sock (5); - transferring the stitches (4) of a first half-row (x) onto the corresponding stitches (4) of the second half-row (y); arranging the stitches (4) of the said first and second half-rows (x,y) along a circumferential arc, at a constant angular distance, with a predetermined pitch in relation to the selected restitching fineness; - restitching the pairs of stitches (4) thus arranged and making one or more closing knots; - executing the cutting of the restitching thread; - returning the sock (5), with the toe (51) thus restitched, into the straight position and discharging it.

Process for stitching the toe of a stocking in accordance with the invention, comprising 
the initial phase of producing a knitted tubular manufacture product, particularly a 

stocking (5), commencing with the top (50), and terminating at the toe (51) which 
remains open, with a circular machine (1), comprising the following further operations: 


removing the plate (10) of the textile head of the machine (1); 
raising the knitting needles (2), with the plates (3) closed, in such a way that 
the stitches of the last row knitted, i.e. the end of the toe of the stocking (5), 

will be secured by them in a position corresponding to the zone in which the 
respective needles (2) are taken; 
then raising the said needles (2), with the plates open, in such a way as to 
position the stitches (4) above the nose (30) of the plates (3); 
taking the said stitches (4) of the respective needles (2), one by one, and 
retaining them;
 
lowering the needles (2) in such a way as to release the toe (51) of the stocking 

(5) from the textile head of the machine (1); 
transferring the stocking (5) with the stitches (4) of the toe (51), which have 
been thus retained, to outside the textile head of the machine (1), to a 

predetermined distance from this latter; 
inverting the stocking (5) in such a way that in its inverted position it will have 
the top (50) positioned above the toe (51); 
transferring the stitches (4) of a first half-row (x) to the corresponding stitches 
(4) of the second half-row (y), with a turn of 180Â° about a diametral axis of 

the circumference delimited by the last knitted row of stitches, in such a way 
that each stitch (4) of the first half-row (x) is juxtaposed and coaxial to the 

corresponding stitch (4) of the second half-row (y); 
positioning the stitches (4) of the said first and second half-rows (x,y) thus 
associated according to a circumfercntial arc, at a predetermine constant 

angular distance selected in accordance with the desired stitching fineness;  
 
re-stitching the pairs of stitches (4) thus arranged and, at the end of the re-stitching, 
producing one or more knots to close it; 
cutting the re-stitching thread; 
returning the stocking (5) with the toe (51), thus re-stitched, to the "straight" 
position, i.e. final position, and unloading it. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by the fact that it comprises the 
operation of transferring the stitches (4) of the first half-row (x) to the corresponding 

stitches (4) of the second half-row (y), after first positioning all the said stitches (4) of 
the first row on the corresponding means (6) provided for their removal from the textile 

head of the machine (1) and for the subsequent turning of the stitches (4) of the first 
row (x). 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the said re-stitching 
comprises the operation of transferring the stitches (4) to a re-stitching mounting. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by the fact that if the number of 
stitches (4) in the first half-row is different from the number of stitches (4) in the 

second half-row (y), those stitches (4) which are not included in the aforementioned 
association are likewise re-stitched. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the inverting and 
subsequent re-positioning of the stocking (5) are effected by means of a pneumatic 

turning tube (8) which is coaxial with the stocking (5), being subjected to a 
predetermined reciprocal movement in the direction of its own longitudinal axis (a-a), in 

such a way as to allow insertion into the stocking (5) on the side of the toe (51), to 
engage the border of the top (50), and to allow the extraction for turning the stocking 

(5) with the top (50) thus engaged.
