<ABSTRACT>
A mould for thermoforming and sealing open trays (3, 3') of plastic has tray-shaped metal elements (2, 2'), which a level rim (11, 11') borders on the open side. In order that the outer seam of a first plastic tray can be joined by sealing to the outer seam of a second plastic tray, placed invertedly against it, by one and the same mould without the additional supply of heat, it is provided according to the invention that the rim (11, 11') has a heat-insulating top (18), separate from the cooled metal element (2, 2') and fastened on the latter.

<CLAIMS>
Tool for deep-drawing and sealing open shells (3) made from plastics, 
with a substantially planar edge (11, 11') at least partially surrounding 

the shell-shaped metal body (2, 2') on the open side on one plane, which 
edge is provided with a heat insulating attachment (18) separate from the 

cooled metal body (2, 2') and, attached thereto, characterised in that for 
sealing, the attachment (18, 18') is fitted externally onto the open side 

of the tool, and is composed of a first frame-shaped plate (18, 18') made 
from steel and a second frame-shaped plate (19) mounted between this 

and the metal body (2), made from heat insulating material. 
Tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the attachment (18) has 
at least one projection (17, 17') projecting outwards on at least a part of 

the length of the frame-shaped plate. 
Tool according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that at least one 
(18, 18') of the frame-shaped plates (18, 18', 19, 19') is composed of 

segments. 
Tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the second 
frame-shaped plate (19, 19') of heat insulating material is at the most 

half the thickness of the first plate (18, 18').
