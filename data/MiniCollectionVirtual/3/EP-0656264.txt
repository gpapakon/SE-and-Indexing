<ABSTRACT>
An image receiving sheet for thermal transfer printing according to the 
present invention comprises a dye receiving layer (1), a foam film (3), an 

adhesive layer (4), a release layer (5), a support layer (6) and a lubricant 
layer (7) which are successively laminated. The image receiving sheet for 

thermal transfer printing has a seal portion consisting of the dye receiving 
layer (1), the foam film (3) and the adhesive layer (4), also having a support 

portion consisting of the release layer (5), the support layer (6) and the lubricant 
layer (7). The image receiving sheet for thermal transfer printing 

according to the present invention is formed such that: 

(1) the smoothness of the dye receiving layer (1) is equal to or larger 
than 2000 seconds; 
(2) the foam film (3) contains a white inorganic pigment in an amount 
of 5 to 30 weight % and comprises microvoids formed by mixing resins that 

re not compatible with each other, having a cushion ratio of 5 to 30% and a 
density of 0.7 to 1.1 g/cmÂ³ measured in accordance with the measuring 

method of JIS L1015; 
(3) each of the seal portion and the support has more than one antistatic 
layer (2,7); and 
(4) the stiffness of the whole image receiving sheet for the thermal 
transfer printing ranges from 400 to 1000 standard Gurley units when 

measured in accordance with the measuring method of TAPPI (Technical 
Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry) T 543pm84.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image receiving
sheet for thermal transfer printing suitable for use in a
thermal transfer recording method and, particularly, a
sublimation thermal transfer recording method. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an image
receiving sheet for thermal transfer printing comprising a seal
portion and a support portion in which, after a thermal-transferred
image is formed on the seal portion, the seal
portion can be detached from the support portion and bonded to
an object.There is widely known a thermal transfer recording
method in which, by selectively heating an ink ribbon with
heating means, such as a thermal head, a laser or the like,
in response to an image information, a dye on the ink ribbon is
transferred to an image receiving sheet by thermal diffusion,
such as sublimation or the like, or a thermal fusion to thereby
form an image on the image receiving sheet. Recently, a so-called
sublimation thermal transfer recording method receives a
remarkable attention. This method forms a full color image with
continuous gradation by using a thermal-diffusive dye, such as a
sublimable dye. An attempt is made on forming the image on the
image receiving sheet in response to an image signal of a video
image by using the sublimation thermal transfer recording
method.New usage of the image receives a remarkable 
attention. The new usage of the image is usage of the image
formed by the sublimation thermal transfer recording method,
i.e., bonding the transferred image to an arbitrary object,
e.g., forming an image of a person on his business card, for
example.For realizing the image receiving sheet suitable for
use in a seal label, an image receiving sheet for use in a seal
label is proposed which comprises a seal portion on which an
image is formed and a supporting mount portion supporting the
seal portion and in which, after the image is formed on the seal
portion, the seal portion can be detached from the support
portion and bonded to an arbitrary object. The seal portion has
a dye receiving layer having a base member made of white PET
(poly(ethylene terephthalate)) or transparent PET as a base
member, further having an adhesive layer on the side of the
support portion.However, having the seal portion comprising the base
member made of white PET or transparent PET, the above image
receiving sheet for use in the seal label is harder as compared
with a general image receiving sheet for use in other areas than
the seal label, hence being prevented from being
