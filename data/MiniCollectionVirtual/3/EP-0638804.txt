device and an apparatus for use in serum separation which 

is capable of completely separating serum and clot during 
the separation of a blood sample into serum and clot by 

means of a centrifugal separation operation. The serum 
separating device in accordance with the present invention 

is provided with a cylindrical member (13), which fits to an 
opening (12a) of a blood collection tube (12) and which has an inner 

diameter which is slightly smaller than an inner diameter 
of the opening (12a), and a movable member (14,15,17), the movable member 

comprising: a member main portion (14) which is inserted into 
the cylindrical member (13) and which presses against inner 

walls of the cylindrical member (13), and an annular isolating 
member (15) which fits to an outer circumferential portion of 

the member main portion (14); wherein: the movable member (17) has a 
specific gravity between that of serum and that of clot; 

and the annular isolating member (15) comprises at least one of 
a material possessing elasticity and liquid permeability, 

and a material possessing the quality of swelling in 
response to immersion in liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a serum separating device 
and an apparatus for serum separation which are used at the time 
of the separation of a blood sample into serum and clot by means 
of centrifugal separation and the like. Conventionally, since diagnostic tests for blood samples 
are primarily conducted using serum (plasma), a preprocessing 
operation prior to testing is required in which a blood sample 
which is collected in a blood collection tube is separated into 
a serum or plasma (hereinafter referred to as serum) and a clot 
or blood cells (hereinafter referred to as a clot). Commonly, in such a serum separation operation, the whole 
blood sample which is collected is placed in a blood collection 
tube, this is subjected to centrifugal separation, and the serum 
which comprises the sample is separated therefrom. However, in 
such centrifugal separators, the state of the separation of the 
serum and the clot is extremely unstable, and if the slightest 
shock is applied, the blood cells present in the clot which is 
sedimented contaminates the serum, so that extremely careful 
operations are required in the handling of the blood sample 
after separation. Various devices have been proposed in order to improve this 
unstable separation state of the blood sample after centrifugal 
separation, and to simplify the testing operation; an example 
thereof is a method employing a sealant possessing thixotropic 
characteristics and having a specific gravity between that of 
serum and clot.  This sealant has, for example, a synthetic resin of low 
molecular weight such as silicone oil or the like as a primary 
component thereof, and possesses a stable specific gravity and 
thixotropic characteristics; during centrifugal separation, this 
sealant becomes liquid and forms a strong partition above the 
clot. However, the following difficulties are present in this 
sealant. 
(1) In the case in which the material in the clot is 
abnormal, it is impossible to form a strong partition. For 
example, in the case in which the specific gravity of the clot 
is small and the clot is soft, as is seen in dialysis patients, 
it is impossible to completely separate the serum from the clot. (2) Since the sealant is water insoluble, the sealant is 
mutually dissolvable with lipid-soluble drugs which are 
difficult to dissolve in water. Accordingly, in the case in 
which the drug concentration present in the blood is to be 
measured, there are cases in which the drugs dissolve in the 
sealant, and the values obtained by
