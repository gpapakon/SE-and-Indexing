<ABSTRACT>
Non-peptidic RXD analogues are provided that inhibit biological cellular and molecular interactions which are dependent on RXD recognition, wherein X is one of the amino acid residues G, E, Y, A or F. In particular, RGD surrogates are provided having no sequence of  alpha -natural amino acids and comprising a guanidino and a carboxyl terminal groups spaced by a chain of 11 atoms, at least 5 of which are carbon atoms. The compounds inhibit cell adhesion and are useful for the treatment of several pathological disorders, e.g., thrombosis, autoimmune diseases, metastasis, allergy, host-graft reactions and inhibition of scar tissue formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel non-peptidic 
compounds having terminal guanidino and carboxyl functional 
groups, to their preparation and to pharmaceutical 
compositions comprising them for treatment of several 
pathological disorders. The ability of various cell types to adhere to and to 
5 interact with other cells or with components of the 
extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for maintaining cell 
functions and tissue integrity via signalling between and 
within the communicating cells (Springer, 1990; Hynes, 1992; 
Shimizu et al., 1991). Cellular interactions with soluble or 
insoluble components of the plasma, the interstitial matrix 
or the ECM, are carried out primarily via a family of cell-surface 
receptors designated integrins that are present on 
most cell types, including lymphocytes, tumor cells and 
platelets (Ruoslahti, 1991; Hynes, 1992). The integrins are heterodimeric molecules consisting of 
an alpha (α) and a beta (β) subunits which are non-covalently 
linked. Eleven α and six β subunits have been identified. The 
pairing of α and β subunits exhibits high fidelity in certain 
tissues and cell types but degenerates in other cases. The integrins play an important role in integrating the 
ECM outside the cell with the actin-containing cytoskeleton 
inside the cell. They are two-headed: the extracellular 
portion is responsible for the binding of adhesive proteins, 
in many cases recognizing the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequences 
within these ligands, and the intracellular portion interacts 
with elements of the cytoskeleton. The target epitope of several integrin receptors is the 
RGD sequence, a cell adhesion motif shared by several matrix-associated  
 
adhesive glycoproteins, such as fibronectin (FN), 
vitronectin (VN), fibrinogen, thrombospondin, and von 
Willebrand factor (Yamada & Kennedy, 1984; Hynes, 1992; 
Ruoslahti, 1988; D'Souza et al., 1991a). The best characterized of these proteins is fibronectin, 
a large and abundant glycoprotein of extracellular matrices 
and plasma, which serves as a prototype cell adhesion 
molecule. Fibronectin is a multifunctional protein that 
supports cell attachment and spreading in eukaryotes and also 
mediates bacterial cell adhesion. It binds to numerous cell 
surface and matrix constituents including glycosaminoglycans, 
heparin, proteoglycans, fibrin and collagen, and triggers a 
variety of cellular responses (Hynes, 1990). The tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) was identified as the 
minimal sequence within the central cell binding domain
