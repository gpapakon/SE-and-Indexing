<ABSTRACT>
A hydrostatic pump, in which the replacement, the maintenance and the repair of any components relevant for the performance of the pump are simplified by a modular design, has a casing (1) with inlet (2) and outlet (3) and a recess into which, in the manner of a cartridge, an insert (4) is inserted. Fastened in the insert there are (on a driveshaft (8)), elements (21, 22, 31, 32, 41, 42) which generate a space (cavity) having a variable volume.

A hydrostatic pump having: 

a housing (1) with an inlet (2) and an outlet (3) and with a cup-shaped 
cutout, 
at least two pairs of rotors which extend within the cylindrical 
interior in a plane transversely with respect to the cylinder 

axis and each comprise an external rotor (21, 31, 41) and an 
internal rotor (22, 32, 42), 
the internal rotors being secured radially to a drive shaft (8) 
running parallel to the cylinder axis, and a plate (30, 40), 

which is fixed radially to the insert in a manner preventing 
twisting (30a), being provided in the axial direction of the 

drive shaft (8) between the pairs of rotors, 
 
characterized 


in that an insert (4), corresponding in its external shape to the 
internal shape of the cup-shaped cutout, and having a base (5) 

and a cylindrical interior with an opening on the side remote 
from the base (5), is provided, 
in that the insert (4) has an input (6) connecting the 
cylindrical interior to the inlet (2) and an output (7) 

connecting the cylindrical interior to the outlet, 
in that the insert (4) is introduced into the cup-shaped cutout 
in the manner of a cartridge and held by a locking element (9), 

and 
in that a plate (30, 40) separates the pairs of rotors from one 
another with gaps therebetween and fixes them to the insert (4). 
A hydrostatic pump according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pump is constructed as a gerotor pump, the external 

rotors (21, 31, 41) are constructed as internally toothed hollow 
gears and the internal rotors (22, 32, 42) are constructed as 

externally toothed pinions, 

in that the drive shaft (8) is offset parallel to the cylinder 
axis by an amount (a) corresponding to half the tooth depth of  

 
the internal rotors or half the mesh depth of the external rotors 

in the radial direction, and 
in that the internal rotors (22, 32, 42) are secured to the drive 
shaft (8) such that a rotation of 
the drive shaft (8) is 
transmitted to the internal rotors and the internal rotors are 

movable axially along the drive shaft (8). 
A hydrostatic pump according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the base (5) of the insert (4) has on the side remote from 

the interior a receiver for a first bearing (10) and has, centred 
in the receiver, a through hole whereof the centre axis is offset 

parallel to the cylinder axis by the amount (a), 

in that a first bearing (10) is provided in the receiver for 
bearing the drive shaft (8), which is guided through the through 

hole, in the base (5), 
in that, on the side of the pairs of rotors remote from the base 
(5), a cover (51), which has on the side remote from the pairs 

of rotors a receiver for a second bearing (60) and, centred in 
the receiver, a through hole whereof the centre axis is offset 

parallel to the cylinder axis by the amount (a), is set on the 
drive shaft (8), 
in that the second bearing (60) is provided in the receiver of 
the cover for bearing the drive shaft (8) in the cover (51), 

in that the cover (51) is connected to the insert (4) by a 
securing element (57), and 
in that gaps are provided in the axial direction of the drive 
shaft (8) above and below the pairs of rotors. 
A hydrostatic pump according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that a respective further plate (20, 50) having a gap is 

provided in the axial direction above and below the topmost and 
bottommost pair of rotors (21, 22, 41, 42) respectively. 
A hydrostatic pump according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the relative angular offset in relation to 

the axis of the drive shaft of the toothing of the internal and 
external rotors of the pairs of rotors is 360°/(number of pairs  

 
of rotors). 
A hydrostatic pump according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that to adjust the gaps a spacer element (56) 

is provided between the cover (51) and the securing element (57). 
A hydrostatic pump according to one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the heat expansion coefficients λ

respective materials from which the respective pairs of rotors 

(21, 22, 31, 32, 41, 42), the plates (20, 30, 40, 50), the cover

viscosity η(T) of the fluid with respect to the 

viscosity η(T

with the equation 


 
is approximately proportional to the relative change in the 

temperature-dependent sum of all the gap thicknesses D
