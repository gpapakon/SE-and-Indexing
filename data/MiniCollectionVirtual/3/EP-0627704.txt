<ABSTRACT>
An article information printer is composed of a 
printing head (9) having a row of dot printing elements, 

for performing a printing on paper by the dot printing 
elements, a feed mechanism for feeding the paper in a 

direction substantially perpendicular to the row of dot 
printing elements each time the printing head (9) is 

driven, a memory (3) for storing print image data in a 
dot matrix form, and a print controller (1, 2) for 

reading the print image data from the memory (3) in 
units of dot lines and driving the printing head (9) in 

accordance with the read data. Particularly, the print 
controller has a mode setting section for setting one of 

a page selection mode and a line selection mode, a first 
image producing section for performing in the page 

selection mode a process of converting print data for 
one page supplied from an external device as article 

information into dot images and storing the dot images 
in the memory (3) as the print image data, and a second 

image producing section for performing in the line 
selection mode a process of converting print data for 

one line supplied from the external device as article 
information into dot images and storing the dot images 

as the print image data. The second image producing section 
includes a printing height changing section for 

changing the number of dot lines for the print image 
data according to the maximum height of the dot images 

obtained for one line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article information
printer for printing article information in different
forms such as characters, bar codes, and
graphics.In a supermarket, an article information printer is
used to issue a label indicating article information
such as an article code, an article name, and an unit
price. At the time of issuing labels, the article
information printer performs a print preparation process
of producing print image data in a dot matrix based on
print data for one page which are transmitted from a
host computer as article information, and repeatedly
performs a printing process according to the print image
data produced in the print preparation process so as to
issue a required number of labels.The print preparation process is started after
print data for one page have been received from the host
computer. In this process, print data are converted
into dot images of characters, bar codes, and graphics,
and stored in a frame memory as a print image data. In
the printing process, the print image data stored in the
frame memory is read in units of dot lines, and a
printing head is driven in accordance with each read
data.On the other hand, an article information printer
may be connected to an electronic cash register serving 
as the host computer in order to issue a receipt as the
record of a sales transaction. In this case, a cash
register prepares print data for each article code
entered by an operator in sales registration, and
transmits all the print data to the article information
printer upon completion of the sales registration.However, when a receipt is to be issued using the
above article information printer, a time between
completion of the sales registration and completion of
the receipt issuance is considerably long. For this
reason, the receipt cannot be quickly handed to a
customer.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an article information printer capable of shortening
the practical print preparation period required
for issuing a single slip on which article information
are printed in different forms, without restricting
variation in the image height.The above object can be attained by an article
information printer comprising a printing head having a
row of dot printing elements, for performing a printing
on paper by the dot printing elements, a feed mechanism
for feeding the paper in a direction substantially perpendicular
to the row of dot printing elements each time
the printing head is driven, a memory for storing print
image data in a dot
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An article information printer comprising:

a printing head (9) having a row of dot printing
elements, for performing a printing on paper by said dot

printing elements;
a feed mechanism (10, PR1) for feeding the paper in
a direction substantially perpendicular to the row of

dot printing elements each time said printing head (9)
is driven;
a memory (3) for storing print image data in a dot
matrix form; and
a print controller (1, 2) for reading the print
image data from said memory (3) in units of dot lines

and driving said printing head (9) in accordance with
the read data;

   characterized in that

said print controller (1, 2) has mode setting means
(ST12, ST12-ST17) for setting one of a page selection

mode and a line selection mode, first image producing
means (ST7) for performing in the page selection mode a

process of converting print data for one page supplied
from an external device as article information into dot

images and storing the dot images in said memory (3) as
the print image data, and second image producing means

(ST8) for performing in the line selection mode a process
of converting print data for one line supplied from

the external device as article information into dot

images and storing the dot images as the print image
data; and
said second image producing means (ST8) includes
printing height changing means (ST44, ST48, ST54, ST58,

ST64, ST68) for changing the number of dot lines for the
print image data according to the maximum height of the

dot images obtained for one line.
An article information printer according to
claim 1, characterized in that said second image 

producing means includes converting means (ST45, ST55,
ST65) for performing a conversion each time print data

is supplied from the external device and arranging each
dot image obtained by the conversion in a column direction

within said memory (3), and first enabling means
(ST24, ST28) for detecting that a predetermined command

serving as a delimiter of the print data for one line is
supplied from the external device, and enabling a

printing process on print image data formed of dot
images which are already stored in said memory (3)

before the predetermined command is supplied.
An article information printer according to
claim 2, characterized in that said second image producing

means (ST8) includes second enabling means (ST41,
ST42, ST46, ST51, ST52, ST56, ST61, ST62, ST66) for
