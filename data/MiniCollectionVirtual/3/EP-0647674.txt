<ABSTRACT>
A method for the preparation of a stabilized polyether-ester elastomer 
composition is disclosed. 
The method comprises a step of: melt blending a 
copolyester consisting of short chain ester units and long 

chain ether units with an organic phosphite compound and an 
epoxy compound in the presence of a catalyst.


Preferably used is a combination of a pentaerythritol disphosphite, a 

diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and an alkyl- or 
alkenyltriphenylphosphonium halide as catalyst. 
The polyether-ester elastomer prepared is superior in 
thermal resistance, hydrolysis resistance and flow properties, 

so that it is suitable to extrusion blow molding into hoses, 
belts, industrial parts and auto-components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a method 
for preparing a polyether-ester elastomer and, more 
particularly, to a method for the preparation of 
polyether-ester elastomer, capable of improving thermal 
resistance, hydrolysis resistance, melt flow properties and 
other physical properties suitable for extrusion blow molding. As known to those skilled in the art, thermoplastic 
polyether-ester elastomer is a kind of block copolymer wherein 
rubber-like polyether soft segments and plastic polyester hard 
segments are irregularly linked to one another. Accordingly, 
since thermoplastic polyether-ester elastomer typically has 
excellent rubber-like properties, such as low-temperature 
durability, flexibility, elasticity and the like, and 
excellent plastic properties such as mechanical strength, heat 
resistance, low-temperature resistance, moldability and the 
like, it is useful for (flexible) hoses, belts, industrial 
elements, sport goods, auto-components and etc. However, it is known that the thermoplastic 
polyether-ester elastomer is likely to generate the degradation  
 
of physical properties and the discoloration of yellowing an 
article made thereof when it is exposed to outdoor conditions 
including a ultraviolet light for a long time. Moreover, the 
thermoplastic polyether-ester resin is poor in melt flow 
properties and thus, when it is subjected to extrusion blow 
molding, it extends from a die. The extrusion blow articles 
made thereof have not stable forms, further being suspended. In order to improve the thermal resistance and the 
hydrolysis resistance of polyether-ester elastomer, many 
methods have been proposed. For example, a polycarbodiimide 
compound and a phosphite compound are used alone or in 
combination, to provide hydrolysis resistance. The prepared 
resin, however, is inferior in melt flow properties. As an attempt to make the polyether-ester elastomer having 
been improved melt viscosity and crystallization rate, 
aliphatic alkaline salts have been added. However, this 
technique is not preferred for practical use since it 
adversely affects the environmental stability of the 
elastomer. Another attempt in that melt viscosity is improved by 
achieving crosslinking in the elastomer with primary or 
secondary amines has been made. For the increase of melt 
viscosity, an attempt of forming chemical crosslinks with a 
primary or secondary amine has been carried out. However, the 
resins provided by the attempt are also unstable to exterior 
conditions and are not
