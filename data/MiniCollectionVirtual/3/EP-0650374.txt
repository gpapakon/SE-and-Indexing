<ABSTRACT>
Use of a calcium carbonate based porous material as support for at least one growth factor in the preparation of a bioabsorbable implant to be placed in a living animal organism, in particular a vertebrate. In the case of an osteoinductive growth factor, the implant may be a bone filler or may be placed in a conjunctive tissue where it will generate bone tissue for use as an autograft. In the case of a non-osteoinductive growth factor, the implant may be used to grow cells in vivo. It is, for example, possible to use a hollow implant into which modified autologous cells are introduced, particularly by gene insertion. Once in place, the implant becomes an organoid correcting, for example, a dysfunction of genetic origin.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a porous calcium carbonate based material as support for at least
one growth factor, the said support being free of collagen in the case where the

said growth factor is an osteoinductive factor, in the preparation of a
bioabsorbable implant intended to be fitted in a living animal organism, in

particular in a vertebrate.
Use according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said calcium
carbonate is in the form of aragonite, and in particular coral skeleton.
Use according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the said growth
factor is an osteoinductive factor.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the said
implant is intended to be fitted as a bone filler.
Use according to Claim 3, characterised in that the said implant is
intended to be fitted in a non-osseous site.
Use according to either of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the said
growth factor is a non-osteoinductive factor.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the said
implant is intended for in vivo cell culture.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the said cells
are genetically modified cells, in particular autologous cells.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the said cells
are modified by insertion of a gene intended to remedy a genetic defect.
Use according to any one of Claims 7 to 9, characterised in that the
said implant is in the form of a hollow piece provided with an opening which can

be closed off by a plug.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterised in that at least one
growth factor is deposited by impregnation on the internal wall of the said hollow

piece.
Use according to Claim 10 or 11, characterised in that a cell culture to
be cultivated is introduced into the hollow part of the implant and the said hollow

part is then closed off using the plug before carrying out implantation.
