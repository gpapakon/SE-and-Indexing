<ABSTRACT>
A vaporizer apparatus having a housing assembly (10) including a fuel inlet chamber (11) fed by an inlet solenoid valve (13). A valve member (16) closes a delivery passage (15) from the fuel inlet chamber (11) to a heat exchange chamber (20) comprising a primary heat exchange portion (21) and a delivery portion (22), divided by a gas/liquid separation portion (23). A coolant jacket (26) having a coolant inlet (27) and a coolant outlet (28) is in circuit with the engine coolant circuit for the purposes of delivering heat to the heat exchange chamber (20). Operation of the valve member (16) is achieved by means of a primary diaphragm (31) operable in response to heat exchanger pressure by means of aperture (34). A delivery passage (36) feeds gas into a demand regulator chamber (37) which in turn supplies a line outlet (40) to the engine. A demand regulator diaphragm (41) responsive to demand in the supply line is characterised by being adjustable by means of a variable length spring (47) supported in the housing assembly (10) and adjusted by means of a threaded plug (50). The demand regulator diaphragm (41) operates a delivery valve (46) to regulate the flow through the delivery passage (36). A start up/idling assembly (51) comprises a solenoid valve (52) interposed in a passage (53) directly linking the delivery portion (22) of the heat exchange chamber (20) and the demand regulator chamber (37).

<DESCRIPTION>
 VAPOURIZER APPARATUS This invention relates to a vapourizer apparatus for fuel burning machines.This invention has particular but not exclusive application to vaporizers for use in liquefied petroleum gas ( PG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) fuelled, internal combustion (IC) powered vehicles, and for illustrative purposes reference will be made to such application. However, it is to be understood that this invention could be used in other applications, such as fuel delivery generally. Vaporizers for use in IC engines generally comprise a pneumatically operated valve variably operable as a function of depression of the gas supply line to the mixer. Valves of this nature are generally matched to the demand range of a particular IC engine. The wide range of fuel demands from large and small engines means that specific vaporizer designs must be produced for each engine type.Since the operation of the valve is generally by means of a pneumatic actuator, there exists a potential for low volume gas leakage when the engine is stopped, establishing a potential explosion risk and thus compromising safety. The use of a pneumatic demand valve for fuel flow control suffers also from the inherent disadvantage that the valves are slow acting resulting in the gas supply lagging behind the IC engine's instantaneous fuel demand. The present invention aims to substantially alleviate the above disadvantages and to provide vapourizer apparatus which will be safe, reliable and efficient in use. Other objects and advantages of this invention will hereinafter become apparent. With the foregoing and other objects in view, this invention in one aspect resides broadly in vapourizer apparatus for a fuel burning machine and including:- a fuel receiving chamber having a fuel supply inlet and an outlet, the inlet being closable by inlet valve means responsive to the operation of the machine; a heat exchanger communicating with said outlet and having pressure limiting means, and adjustable demand valve means controlling flow through a 

delivery outlet of said heat exchanger in response to demand from said machine.Preferably, the apparatus is adapted to the use of LPG fuel and accordingly the fuel receiving chamber is adapted to receive fuel which is a liquid under delivery conditions to the fuel receiving chamber, and wherein the heat exchanger comprises a vaporising chamber for the fuel. However, it is envisaged that the apparatus will be useful in respect of CNG fuels where the high pressure differential between the stored gas
