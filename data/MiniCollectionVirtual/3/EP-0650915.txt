<ABSTRACT>
The device contains a number of sensors (15) which are arranged decentrally on a spinning or winding machine and which are provided for the on-line monitoring of the winding quality during the production of the bobbins (4). Each sensor (15) contains a light source, illuminating and imaging optics and a detector. The sensors (15) are preferably mounted on the bobbin changers (5). Use on spinning or winding machines equipped with an electronic yarn-cleaning system (12, 13, 14), with an interlinking of the measurement signals.

Apparatus for checking the winding quality of
yarn bobbins (4), with a sensor (15) which has a light

source (18) for illuminating part of the surface of a
yarn bobbin (4), means for imaging the illuminated part

of the surface on a detector and an evaluation circuit
for the signals generated by the detector, characterized

in that at least one sensor (15) of the said type for the
spinning or winding stations is arranged decentrally on

a spinning or winding machine, in that the sensor is
directed towards an outer surface of the yarn bobbins

(4), and these yarn bobbins (4) are thereby also
monitored in the bobbin interior.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a sensor (15) is arranged at each spinning or

winding station.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, with bobbin
changers, respectively serving a plurality of production

stations, for the removal of the full bobbins, characterized
in that the sensors (15) are mounted on the

bobbin changers (5) and are respectively assigned in the
manner of a travelling sensor to a plurality of production

stations.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the light source (18) of the sensor (15)

is arranged in such a way that an oblique or glancing
illumination of the surface of the yarn bobbin (4) takes

place.
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the surface of the yarn bobbin (4) is illuminated by

means of a light gap (17), and the image (17') of this 
light gap is imaged on the detector (19).
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the surface of the yarn bobbin (4) is illuminated in

spot form by means of a perforated diaphragm (20), and in
that this light spot is imaged on the detector (19).
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the detector (19) is formed by a sensor

row, preferably by a double-wedge sensor.
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the detector (19) is a position-sensitive

detector (PSD).
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in
that, for the detection of tight ends (22), a radial

cutout of the end faces of the bobbins (4) is imaged on
a detector (21) which consists of photoreceivers in the

form of a linear array or which can be illuminated in
linear-array form, the width of the linear arrays corresponding

approximately to the width of the shadow cast by
a tight end.
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the detector (19) is formed by a photodiode array

arranged parallel to the axis of the bobbin (4).
Use of the apparatus according to Claim 1 on a
winding or spinning machine equipped with an electronic

yarn-cleaning system, characterized in that the signals
from the apparatus for checking the winding quality and

those from the yarn-cleaning system (12, 13, 14) are
evaluated in consideration of one another and a functional

relation between the two devices is made.
Use according to Claim 11, characterized in that
the yarn speed is measured and checked for fluctuations

by the yarn-cleaning system (12, 13, 14), and in that
abnormal fluctuations are interpreted as an indication of

a winding fault and preferably activate the associated
sensor (15) of the apparatus for checking the winding

quality.
Use according to Claim 12, characterized in that
the yarn speed is measured and integrated continuously by

the yarn-cleaning system (12, 13, 14) and the diameter of 
the bobbins (4) is measured by the apparatus for checking

the winding quality, and in that the two measured values
are interlinked in order to obtain the profile trend of

the density over the bobbin.
Use according to Claim 11, characterized in that
the instantaneous yarn speed is measured and is examined

for frequency changes by spectral analysis, in that the
frequency components located outside a given limit are

classed as winding faults, and in that the qualification
of the faults takes place by means of the apparatus for

checking the winding quality.
Use according to Claim 14, characterized in that
digital signal processors are used for the spectral

analysis.
Use according to Claim 14 or 15, characterized in
that, in addition to the instantaneous yarn speed, other

speeds, especially the rotational speed and the thread-laying
speed of the grooved drum driving the cross-wound

bobbin (4), are also measured, and in that these speeds
are subjected to a spectral analysis.
