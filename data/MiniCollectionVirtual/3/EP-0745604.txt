<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a condensation 
curable type room temperature curable fluoropolymer 
composition, particularly a composition excellent in fast 
curability and deep-portion curability; and to fluorine-containing 
organosilicon compounds suitable for obtaining 
elastomers useful in, for example, rubber materials and 
release agents, a method of producing said organosilicon 
compounds; and room temperature curable silicone 
compositions containing the same compounds. Conventionally, as a condensation curable type room 
temperature curable composition, there are known those 
containing, as a base component, a polymer, the backbone 
chain of which consists of organosiloxane structures or 
polyoxyalkylene structures and which has a crosslinking 
point at both ends of the molecular chain. Since these 
compositions are liquid prior to curing, they are excellent 
in processability. Further, the resulting cured product is 
excellent in heat resistance, weatherability, electrical 
properties, processability and the like, so that it is 
employed in various fields. However, since the cured 
product is inferior in chemical resistance, solvent  
 
resistance and oil repellant properties, its uses are 
limited. While, room temperature curable fluoropolymer 
compositions comprising, as a main component, a 
fluoropolymer, the backbone chain of which consists of 
fluorine-containing polymer structures, having a 
hydrolyzable group at both ends of the molecular chain; a 
crosslinking agent; and optionally a catalyst is described 
in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 
63-61336, USP 3,950,588 and EP 0151877. The curing of 
these compositions proceeds as the hydrolyzable group at 
the ends of said fluoropolymer and the crosslinking agent 
undergo dehydration condensation by water present in the 
atmosphere to be cured. The room temperature curable 
fluoropolymer compositions are not only excellent in 
processability prior to curing and cured products obtained 
by curing the same are excellent in heat resistance, 
weatherability and electrical properties, but also are 
superior in chemical resistance, solvent resistance and oil 
repellant properties. However, these conventional room temperature curable 
fluoropolymer compositions are slow in curing rate, and 
especially it requires a long time for curing the deep 
portions thereof when left to stand in the atmosphere, 
compared to curable compositions comprising, as a main 
component, a polymer of which backbone chain consists of 
organopol
