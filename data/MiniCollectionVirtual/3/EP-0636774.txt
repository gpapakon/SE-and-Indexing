<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine feed device consisting of a 
cylindrical casing having an entry portion, and a feed portion for 

each engine cylinder. The casing contains a rotatable element 
having an internal capacity. The capacity is arranged to 

communicate with the entry portion and with the feed portions. 
Each feed portion consists of two different-length exit ducts 

extending separately from the casing to join together into a 
single feed duct in the final part of the feed portion. Based on 

two final positions of the rotatable element, only one of the two 
different-length exit ducts is able to communicate with the 

capacity, whereas the other exit duct is closed in an air-tight 
manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine feed 
device of the type indicated in the introduction to claim 1. 
Devices with variable-length feed ducts for internal combustion 
engines are known which have the drawback of being applicable only 
to engines with in-line cylinders, but cannot be used for other 
engine types without creating evident space and cost problems. 
In particular, these known devices have the drawback of not being 
applicable to engines with opposing cylinders, such as 4, 6 or 8 
cylinder Boxer engines or multi-cylinder 60° or 90° V engines, 
without occupying considerable space within the engine compartment 
and leading to increased weight and costs. The object of the present invention is to provide an internal 
combustion engine feed device which is applicable to all types of 
engine, including opposing cylinder engines, without said 
drawbacks. This object is attained according to the present invention by an 
internal combustion engine feed device consisting of a cylindrical 
casing having an entry portion and, for connecting each engine 
cylinder to the casing interior, a respective feed portion, there 
being contained within the casing a rotatable element having an  
 
internal capacity, said capacity being connected to the entry 
portion via an entry aperture and to the feed portions via a 
respective exit aperture in the rotatable element, characterised 
in that each feed portion consists of two different-length exit 
ducts extending separately from the casing to join together into a 
single feed duct in the final part of the feed portion, in which 
said two exit ducts and the corresponding two exit apertures of 
the rotatable element are arranged such that, based on two final 
positions of the rotatable element, only one of said two 
different-length exit ducts is able to communicate with the 
capacity, whereas the other exit duct is closed in an air-tight 
manner. This feed device according to the present invention has the 
advantage that by using two different-length exit ducts for each 
engine cylinder, the feed portion is variable in length in 
accordance with the final position of the rotatable element. This 
method of selecting one of the two exit ducts as a result of 
positioning the exit apertures by rotating the rotatable element 
means that the feed portion can be positioned directly in the 
direction of a determined cylinder, even in the case of an engine 
with opposing cylinders. Hence applying the device of the present invention enables a 
plurality

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine feed device consisting of a 
cylindrical casing (11) having an entry portion (12) and, for 

connecting each engine cylinder to the interior of the casing 
(11), a respective feed portion (13), there being contained within 

the casing (11) a rotatable element (14) having an internal 
capacity (15), said capacity being connected to the entry portion 

(12) via an entry aperture (16) and to the feed portions (13) via 
a respective exit aperture (17) in the rotatable element (14), 

characterised in that each feed portion (13) consists of two 
different-length exit ducts (20, 21) extending separately from the 

casing (11) to join together into a single feed duct in the final 
part of the feed portion (13), in which said two exit ducts (20, 

21) and the corresponding two exit apertures (17, 18) of the 
rotatable element (14) are arranged such that, based on two final 

positions of the rotatable element (14), only one of said two 
different-length exit ducts (20, 21) is able to communicate with 

the capacity (15), whereas the other exit duct (20, 21) is closed 
in an air-tight manner. 
A feed device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 

the different-length exit ducts (20, 21) of each feed portion 
(13), the corresponding exit apertures (17, 18) and the final 

positions of the rotatable element (14) are more than two in 
number. 
A feed device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the rotatable element (14) and the capacity (15) are of 

cylindrical shape. 
A feed device as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the exit ducts (20, 21) are respectively of rectangular 

cross-section. 
A feed device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the exit apertures (17, 18) of the rotatable 

element (14) are identical to the cross-section of the exit ducts 
(20, 21). 
A feed device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the rotatable element (14) is operated by an 

actuator with external pneumatic control. 
A feed device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the engine is an engine with opposing 

cylinders. 
A feed device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that 
the device comprises a plurality of exit portions (13) positioned 

to correspond to the arrangement of the cylinders of an engine 
with opposing cylinders. 
A feed device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the device is constructed of aluminium 

alloy, with the rotatable element (14) of aluminium alloy or 
plastics. 
A feed device substantially as heretofore described and as 
illustrated on the accompanying drawings.
