<ABSTRACT>
Polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane 
copolymers are provided having amine, or ester 

connecting linkages between blocks resulting from the 
melt extrusion of epoxy, carboxy or amine 

functionalized polyarylene ether with epoxy, carboxy 
or amine functionalized organopolysiloxane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane copolymers having
amine or ester connecting groups between blocks.As shown by Shea et al., U.S. patent
4,814,392, silicone-polyarylene ether copolymers can
be made by effecting reaction between amino terminated
organopolysiloxane and anhydride functionalized
polyarylene ether. A reaction can be effected between
a polyphenylene ether referred to hereinafter as
"PPE", which has been functionalized with anhydride
groups utilizing a compound, such as trimellitic
anhydride acid chloride, (TAAC), or maleic anhydride
(MA), and an amine terminated polydiorganosiloxane.
Reaction between PPE-TAAC or PPE-MA, and the amine
terminated polydiorganosiloxane is preferably effected
by a solution technique utilizing an organic solvent,
such as chloroform in an inert atmosphere.In copending application RD-22,547, there
is taught that reaction between anhydride or carboxy
functionalized PPE and amine functionalized
organopolysiloxane can be facilitated by employing
vacuum venting during reactive coextrusion.
Polyphenylene ether-organopolysiloxane copolymers made 
by such vacuum vented extrusion have PPE blocks joined
to organopolysiloxane blocks by imide or amide
linkages.The present invention is based on the
discovery that vacuum venting during reactive
coextrusion also can be used to facilitate the
formation of polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane
block copolymers by effecting reaction between epoxide
functional groups with amine, or carboxylic acid
functional groups, where the functional groups can be
located in the terminal position on either the
polyarylene ether or organopolysiloxane. The
resulting polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane block
copolymers have amine or ester connecting groups
between blocks instead of imide or amide linkages.There is provided by the present invention,
polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane block copolymers
resulting from the reaction between an epoxy
functionalized polyarylene ether, and an amino or
carboxy functionalized organopolysiloxane, or an epoxy
functionalized organopolysiloxane, and an amino or
carboxy functionalized polyarylene ether, where the
polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane copolymers
comprise by weight from 80 to 99.9% of polyarylene
ether and from 20 to 0.1% of organopolysiloxane, and
the polyarylene ether blocks are joined to the
organopolysiloxane blocks by a connecting divalent
structural unit selected from,
