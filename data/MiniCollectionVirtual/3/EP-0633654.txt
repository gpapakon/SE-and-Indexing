<ABSTRACT>
A DC power supply (V
cc
) for a DC motor (2) is controlled 
by a drive transistor (3). An "ON" state of the drive 

transistor (3) is maintained by a comparator (8) or means which 
compares a terminal voltage (V
T
) at a point (4) between the DC 
motor (2) and the drive transistor (3) with a reference voltage 

(V
R
) supplied from the power supply. A clock pulse (P2) is 
applied to the drive transistor (3) to make it periodically turn 

off in order to detect an induced voltage depending upon 
rotation rate of the DC motor (2). The drive transistor (3) 

remains turned off upon stopping the rotating DC motor (2) by 
force. A rotation rate control means (41) is also provided. 

One particular application for the control circuit disclosed is 
as the drive means for a powered window for an automobile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for 
controlling a DC electric motor comprising: 
a DC power supply circuit having a live line providing a 
supply voltage and a return line; a drive transistor connected to the return line and to a 
signal terminal and arranged to be in series with the DC 
electric motor through the signal terminal; trigger means for causing the DC supply circuit through 
the motor to be completed momentarily to start the motor; supply latching means for comparing a terminal voltage at 
said signal terminal with a first voltage derived from the 
supply voltage and supplying a supply latching output for the 
drive transistor while a predetermined relationship holds 
between the said first voltage and the terminal voltage; and means for periodically turning off the drive transistor 
whereby the voltage at the signal terminal is correspondingly 
periodically representative of the condition of the motor. Referring now to Figure 1, a circuit for controlling the 
restraining torque of a DC motor disclosed in Japanese laid-open 
patent application no. JP-A-1-311883 is generally shown, which 
is a circuit of the kind defined above. A DC power supply 1 is 
connected between a Vcc line and ground or GND. A DC motor 2 is 
connected between the Vcc line and the drain of an N-channel 
MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) 3 at 
a relay terminal 4. The MOSFET 3 has its source connected to 
ground and its gate connected to the collector of a PNP 
transistor 5. The PNP transistor 5 has its emitter connected to 
the Vcc line and its base connected to an input terminal 6 via a 
resistor 7. When a negative trigger pulse P1 is supplied to the 
input terminal 6, the PNP transistor 5 is turned on to make the 
MOSFET 3 turn on. The MOSFET 3 in its ON state passes current 
to the DC motor 2 and the motor 2 rotates during the application 
of the negative trigger pulse P1. A comparator 8 for maintaining the rotation of the DC 
motor 2 is connected between the Vcc line and ground via a  
 
supply bus (not shown). The comparator 8 has its inverting 
input connected to the relay terminal 4 or the drain of the 
MOSFET 3, its non-inverting input connected to a movable 
terminal of a variable resistor 9 connected between the Vcc line 
and ground, and an output connected to the gate of the MOSFET 3 
via a resistor 10. The comparator 8 compares the terminal 
voltage VT of the relay terminal 4 with the reference voltage VR 
at the movable terminal of the variable resistor 9. The 
terminal
