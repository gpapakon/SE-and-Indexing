<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is constituted by disposing a photosensitive layer on 

an electroconductive support. The photosensitive 
layer is characterized by containing a specific 

polycarbonate having a side chain comprising a charge-transporting 
group formed by nitrogen atom and benzene 

ring. The charge-transporting group may preferably 
has a specific triphenylamine structure, hydrazone 

structure or biphenyldiamine structure. The 

photosensitive layer is suitable for providing an 
electrophotographic apparatus showing excellent 

electrophotographic characteristics such as a high 
photosensitivity, a good potential stability in 

repetitive use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member
having a photosensitive layer containing a polycarbonate having a
hydrazone or biphenyldiamine group as charge transporting group at
least in the side chain.The present invention also relates to an
image forming method using the electrophotographic
photosensitive member.Heretofore, there have been proposed
inorganic photosensitive members having a
photosensitive layer comprising an inorganic
photoconductive material such as selenium, zinc oxide
or cadmium as a main component. The inorganic
photosensitive members have possessed fundamental
properties in respect of electrophotographic
characteristics to a certain degree but have
encountered problems such as poor film-forming
properties, a low plasticity and an expensive
production cost. The inorganic photoconductive
material generally has a high toxicity. Accordingly,
there have been large constraints on production of the
photosensitive member and handling of the inorganic
photoconductive material.On the other hand, many organic 
photosensitive members having a photosensitive layer
comprising an organic photoconductive material as a
main component have remedied the above drawbacks of
the inorganic photosensitive members and has attracted
considerable attention, thus having been proposed and
also having been put into practical use in some cases.
As the organic photoconductive material for use in the
organic photosensitive member, there have been
proposed a charge transfer complex containing an
organic photoconductive material such as poly-N-vinyl
carbazole and Lewis acid such as 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone.
The charge transfer complex or the
organic photoconductive material has been excellent in
light weight properties and film-forming properties
but has been inferior to the inorganic photoconductive
material in respect of a sensitivity, a durability, a
stability against environmental change, etc.Thereafter, there has been proposed a
photosensitive member having a laminate-type
structure, wherein a photosensitive layer comprises a
charge generation layer (CGL) containing a charge-generating
material (CGM) such as organic
photoconductive dyes or pigments and a charge
transport layer (CTL) containing a charge-transporting
material (CTM) (i.e., so-called "function-separation
type photosensitive member"). Such a function-separation
type photosensitive member has brought 
about a considerable improvement on a conventional
photosensitive member possessing defects such as low
sensitivity
