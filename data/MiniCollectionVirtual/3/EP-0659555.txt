<ABSTRACT>
In a device for producing folded products, the object consists in producing two different folded products at the same time. According to the invention, this is effected in that a transverse folding device (8, 9, 11) comprises a folding blade cylinder and a folding jaw cylinder, each of double width, in the axial direction and has a left-hand and a right-hand inlet (24 and 26 respectively) for a main line (6, 7). In this case, the two part-lines (33, 34) which are folded longitudinally in an uppermost plane (B) can be introduced in each case selectively individually or together into the left-hand inlet (24) or into the right-hand inlet (26).

<CLAIMS>
Device for producing folded products (19; 21; 23; 24), in 
which four formers (1; 2; 3; 4) are provided, having two fixed 

formers (1, 2) arranged side by side on a lower plane (A) and two 
further formers (3, 4) arranged side by side on an upper plane 

(B) and a cross-cutting and cross-folding device (8, 9, 11, 12, 
13) comprising a pin and folding-blade and folding-jaw cylinder 

(9, 11), each of "double width" as seen in the axial direction, 
and having a left (24) and a right entry (26) each for a paper-web 

ribbon (31; 32; 33; 34), characterised in that all four 
formers (1; 2; 3; 4) are oriented in the same direction, in that 

the two formers (3; 4) arranged on the upper plane (B) are 
arranged to be displaceable in the direction of the longitudinal 

axis of the cross-folding device (9, 11) in such a way that the 
paper ribbons (33; 34) guided over them can each be led either 

individually or jointly into the left entry (24) or into the 
right entry (26). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the paper 
ribbons (31; 32; 33; 34) are longitudinally folded by means of 

the formers (1; 2; 3; 4). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the 
cross-folding device includes a cutting-knife cylinder (8), a 

combined cutting-groove, pin and folding-blade cylinder (9) and 
a folding-jaw cylinder (11).
