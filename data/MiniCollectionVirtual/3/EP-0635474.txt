<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for recovering 
acetic acid from an acetic acid/water waste stream 

which includes a dehydration column into which the 
stream is fed and a liquid-liquid extraction system for 

recovering acetic acid from the condensate of the 
overhead stream of the dehydration column. Optionally, 

low pressure and/or high pressure absorber systems are 
provided to process vapor and/or liquid streams 

associated with the recovery system and/or the plant in 
which the acetic acid is used to further the recovery 

of acetic acid and reduce atmospheric pollution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and
apparatus for recovering acetic acid, which is the
solvent typically used in the production of
terephthalic acid and is also a recoverable waste
stream in other important industrial processes. The
method and apparatus provide a significant reduction of
energy consumption, allow an increase in capacity for
existing plants, and eliminate the organics emission
problem currently existing in most terephthalic acid
production plants. Acetic acid is a recoverable solvent utilized in
the production of terephthalic acid in many processes,
see U.S. Patent 4,769,487, British 1,583,755, Canadian
1,113,957, and Japanese 53-71034, 58-39812, 59-33579,
53-79836, and 56-4587.Distillation has been widely used as a primary
operation for acetic acid recovery in such
processes, utilizing one or more towers to process a
number of streams of varying concentrations of acetic
acid with the purpose of recovering it for further use
in the oxidation step. The products from the
distillation tower are a bottom stream of concentrated
acetic acid, and an overhead stream that ideally would
be pure water.Because of the high non-ideality of the system
acetic acid/water and the equilibrium limitation in
such a system, it is necessary to utilize a
distillation tower with a high number of theoretical
stages and high reflux ratio to be able to obtain 
reasonably low levels of acetic acid in the distilled
water.These involve a high investment cost because of
the large dimensions of the required equipment and a
high operating cost because of the high steam
consumption involved. Furthermore, the traditional
process scheme does not allow one to obtain
economically a distillate completely free of acetic
acid. This limitation, in turn, presents two main
problems: a cost associated with the operation
resulting from the acetic acid losses, and an
environmental problem that is continually increasing,
because of the ever more rigorous standards for
acceptable levels of emission to the environment.There has been an effort to look for alternatives
to solve the problem. Resort has been had to
azeotropic distillation, involving the addition of an
additional component to the distillation tower to
improve the relative volatility of the separation and
reduce the separation requirements. This existing
option provides some reduction in the operating costs,
but it generates some additional operating and
environmental problems.A study of the vapour liquid equilibrium of the
components acetic acid/water shows the difficulty

acetic acid, comprising:

(a) feeding at least one input acetic acid-containing
water stream from the plant to a dehydration
