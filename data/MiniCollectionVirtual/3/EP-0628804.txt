<ABSTRACT>
An optical pulse emitted from an optical pulse 
source is incident on a living tissue and is input to an 

optical sampling unit. The optical sampling unit 

detects intensities f of optical pulses detected at the 
respective timings of trigger signals input from a delay 

unit. A first accumulator calculates products t·f of the 
intensities f and the delay times t from the delay unit. 

A second accumulator accumulates the light intensities f. 
An average optical pathlength calculating unit calculates 

an average optical pathlength using the accumulation 
results as the products t·f and the intensities f. An SO₂ 

value calculating unit calculates a ratio of V
HbO2
 to V
Hb
 
from the average optical pathlength to calculate an SO₂ 

value.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method and apparatus for determining a ratio
of concentration of a plurality of absorptive
constituents in a scattering medium.The invention relates to a method and apparatus
for determining a ratio of concentration of a
plurality of the concentration of absorptive
constituents present in a scattering medium.When light having a wavelength near a near-infrared
range is incident on a living tissue,
absorption of the incident light in the living
tissue is greatly influenced by hemoglobin in blood.
The influence of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) is different
from that of deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb). The
absorption spectra of the living tissue change in
accordance with the states of hemoglobin, as shown
in a graph of FIG. 1. The wavelength [nm] of
incident light is plotted along the abscissa in FIG.
1, and the absorbance [mM-1cm-1] is plotted along the
ordinate therein. As shown in this graph, the
absorbance caused by deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) is
higher than that by oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) when the
wavelength is shorter than 800 nm. When the
wavelength is longer than 800 nm, the absorbance
cause by oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) is higher than that by
deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb). That is, the optical 
absorption in the living tissue is understood to change
in accordance with the metabolic conditions of oxygen in
the living tissue.Conventionally, a monitor for oxygen metabolism in a
living tissue has been developed using this principle.
Such a monitor has been put to practical use. In this
oxygen metabolism monitor, however, a relative change
from the start of measurement can only be monitored. For
this reason, the degree (SO2 value) of saturation of
oxygen in blood in a living tissue, which is a ratio of an
oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration to a total hemoglobin
concentration, cannot be measured. Therefore, the SO2
value as the index of oxygen metabolism in the living
tissue cannot be known. Therefore, an attempt has been
made using the following method and apparatus to measure
this SO2 value.First, a measuring apparatus (tradename: Cerebral
Oximeter (invos 3100)) available from Somanetics is used
as an apparatus for measuring an SO2 value in blood in a
living tissue. This apparatus measures the concentration
of an absorptive constituent (hemoglobin) in the
scattering medium (living tissue) using the principle
shown in Fig. 2. More specifically, continuous (CW)
light having different wavelengths in the near-infrared
range is incident on a living tissue 1, and attenuation
amounts of the incident light are detected at
