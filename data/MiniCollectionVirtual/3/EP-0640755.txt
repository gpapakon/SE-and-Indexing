<ABSTRACT>
A lubricating oil feeding apparatus of an internal 
combustion engine (1) can adjust an amount of oil fed to each 

bearing and provides for a reduced number of parts for a 
shaft portion structure of a starter driven gear. In the 

engine, a balancer shaft (12) is synchronously rotated with a 
crankshaft (13). The crankshaft (13) and the balancer shaft (12) are 

rotatably supported on a split surface (3) of a crankcase (2) by 
plain bearings. Parallel oil passages (26,36) communicate with 

oil holes provided in the plain bearings (39a-d) for exclusively 
feeding lubricating oil to at least the crankshaft and the 

balancer shaft. The opening areas of the oil holes 
provided in the plain bearings of the balancer shaft are 

smaller than the oil holes (47) provided in the plain bearings 
of the crankshaft. An outer portion of a starter one-way 

clutch can also be integrally fitted on a rotor. A driven 
gear (44) of the starter (219) is connected to a starter drive gear (218) 

of a starter motor by intermediate gears. The diameter D
b
 
of a starter driven gear bearing portion of the crankshaft 

is the same as the diameter D
a
 of a supporting portion of 
the crankshaft. A starter driven gear (44) (215) of the starter one-way 

clutch (211) is fitted to the starter driven gear (215) bearing 
portion of the crankshaft (13) by a slide bearing to be freely 

rotated relative to the starter driven gear (44) bearing 
portion. A lead groove is provided on the inner surface 

of the bearing for positively feeding oil to the receiving 
surface of the slide bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil 
feeding structure for a starter driven gear bearing, 
wherein a starter driven gear is disposed on a crankshaft 
of an internal combustion engine. There has been known an internal combustion engine 
mounted on a motorcycle of a type in which, as shown in 
Figures 14 and 15, a rotor 104 of a power generator 103 is 
integrally mounted at the leading edge of a crankshaft 102 
projecting sideward from a crankcase 101, and a starter 
system 105 is disposed between the rotor 104 and the 
crankcase 101. In this starter system 105, a starter driven gear 
106, which is rotated in the starting direction by way of 
a starter motor and an intermediate gear (not shown), is 
adapted to transmit the starting torque to the rotor 104 
and the crankshaft 102 by way of a one-way clutch 107. In 
operation of an internal combustion engine, the starter 
driven gear 106 is stopped along with the stoppage of the 
starter motor, and thereby the starter driven gear 106 is 
rotated relative to the crankshaft 102. Accordingly, a 
bearing is required to be provided between the crankshaft 
102 and the starter driven gear 106. The above bearing 
cannot have a structure of forcibly supplying lubricating 
oil as in a slide bearing 109 of the crankshaft 102, and 
it is constituted of a needle bearing 110. In the needle bearing 110 of the starter one-way 
clutch 107 shown in Figure 14, an inner race 111 is used. 
On the contrary, as shown in Figure 15, the inner race 111 
is replaced by a starter driven gear bearing portion 102a 
of the crankshaft 102 which is subjected to high frequency 
quenching. The latter is disadvantageous in increasing 
the number of the processing steps, resulting in increased 
cost.  
 An object of the present invention is to solve 
the above problem and to improve a starter driven gear 
bearing of an internal combustion engine. To achieve this 
object, according to the present invention, an oil feeding 
structure is provided for a starter driven gear bearing, 
wherein the starter driven gear is disposed 
on a crankshaft of an internal combustion engine, 
there being a supporting portion of the 
crankshaft rotatably supported by the crankcase, 
the starter driven gear being disposed on a driven 
gear bearing portion of the crankshaft provided adjacent 
to said supporting portion of the crankshaft 
outside the crankcase, the oil feeding structure 
comprising: 
an outside diameter of said supporting portion 
of the crankshaft being the same as that of the 
said driven gear

Oil feeding structure for a starter driven gear bearing, 
wherein the starter driven gear (215) is disposed on a 

crankshaft (205) of an internal combustion engine (201),
