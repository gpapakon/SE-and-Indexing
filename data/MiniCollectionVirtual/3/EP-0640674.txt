<ABSTRACT>
An emulsion adhesive contains a co- or terpolymer containing predominantly vinyl acetate units or a copolymer emulsion (dispersion) of an acrylate and styrene and a high proportion of flameproofing agents based on compounds of aluminium and/or boron. Additives, such as processing agents, thickeners, suspending agents and wetting agents, are added to the emulsion adhesives, which furthermore contain preservatives, antifoams, dispersants, film-formation agents and a drying retardant. The emulsion adhesives are particularly suitable for bonding rigid polystyrene foams in sheet or board form, but are also used for bonding sandwich-type plasterboard (gypsum plasterboard), wood and cork to a suitable substrate and for bonding ceramic tiles and quarry tiles. Due to their specific composition, the emulsion adhesives have a very broad range of applications, it being particularly advantageous that the emulsion adhesives remain processable for an extended period of several months, the fire resistance of composites is increased and they have high initial adhesive strength.
