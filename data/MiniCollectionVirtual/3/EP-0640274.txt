<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the planting of seeds (58) in the ground. According to the invention, plugging the first outlet orifice (59) of a sowing ploughshare (47) causes the seeds (58) to leave via a second outlet orifice (61) of the said sowing ploughshare (47).

<CLAIMS>
Pneumatic seeder (5) including at least one drill coulter (47) equipped with 
three orifices (56, 59, 61): a inlet orifice (56) through which the flow of air 

conveying the seeds (58) enters, a first outlet orifice (59) via which the seeds 
(58) are plated in the ground, and a second outlet orifice (61), 
characterized 
in that
 plugging the first outlet orifice (59) causes the seeds (58) to exit via 
the second outlet orifice (61). 
Pneumatic seeder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 situated facing 
the inlet orifice (56) is a deflector (57) intended to direct the flow of air and 

of seeds (58) downwards towards the first outlet orifice (59) and that the 
second outlet orifice (61), which emerges behind when considering the 

direction of travel (8) in work, extends just above the deflector (57) and 
slightly higher up than the inlet orifice (56). 
Pneumatic seeder according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the deflector 
(57) extends backwards and downwards. 
Pneumatic seeder according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the drill coulter (47) has a body (53) comprising two rearwardly 
extending side walls (55). 
Pneumatic seeder according to Claim 4 and Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the deflector (57) is fitted between the two side walls (55) of the body 
(53) of the drill coulter (47). 
Pneumatic seeder according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 it has a 
feed pipe (46) connected to the inlet orifice (56) of the drill coulter (47) and 

that the said side walls (55) of the body (53) of the drill coulter (47) are  
 

separated from one another by an average distance which is close to the 
average diameter (d) of the feed pipe (46) or smaller than the said average 

diameter (d). 
Pneumatic seeder according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized 
in that
 the drill coulter (47) has a shoe (52) intended to mark a furrow (54) in 
the ground during work. 
Pneumatic seeder according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the second outlet orifice (61) has a guide member (64) directing the 
flow of air and of seeds (58) downwards just behind the drill coulter (47). 
Pneumatic seeder according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized 
in that
 the drill coulter (47) additionally has a third outlet orifice (62) allowing 
some of the flow of air to escape from the said drill coulter (47) when the 

first outlet orifice (59) is obstructed. 
Pneumatic seeder according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the third outlet 
orifice (62) is situated above the inlet orifice (56) and extends forwards when 

considering the direction of travel (8) during work. 
Combined agricultural implement for working the ground and for sowing (1) 
having an implement for preparing a seed bed (4) and a pneumatic seeder 

(5), 
characterized in that
 it employs a pneumatic seeder (5) according to one 
or more of Claims 1 to 10.
