A process for the preparation of methyl 5-bromo-6-methoxy-1-naphthoate(I) 
by bromination of methyl 6-methoxy-1-naphthoate(II) 

with bromine, which comprises 
employing between 0.5 and 0.6 mol of bromine (Br
2
) per 
mol of methyl 6-methoxy-1-naphthoate(II) and carrying out 

the bromination in the presence of an oxidizing agent 
which is capable of oxidizing hydrogen bromide to bromine. 


The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
peroxy compound is employed as the oxidizing agent. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2, 
wherein hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidizing 

agent. 
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
between 0.5 and 0.8 mol of hydrogen peroxide is employed 

per mol of methyl 6-methoxy-1-naphthoate(II). 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 
1 to 4, wherein the reaction is carried out in a water-miscible 

solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims  
 

1 to 5, wherein a lower aliphatic carboxylic acid or a 
lower aliphatic alcohol is used as the solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 
1 to 6, wherein acetic acid is used as the solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 
1 to 6, wherein methanol is used as the solvent. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 
1 to 8, wherein the reaction is carried out at between 

0Â°C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture, in 
particular between room temperature and the boiling 

point.
