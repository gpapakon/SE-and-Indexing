<ABSTRACT>
High-shear treated materials are passed through a high-shear treatment zone which allows the coexistence of free supra-Kolmogoroff eddies larger than the smallest possible Kolmogoroff eddy diameter and forced sub-Kolmogoroff eddies smaller than this diameter. This zone includes a subsidiary higher-shear zone for suppressing these free eddies. The passage walls (40, 44, 102, 108) move relative to one another transverse to the flow to force the simultaneous development of supra-Kolmogoroff and sub-Kolmogoroff eddies while maintaining liquid films adherent to the passage surfaces. The movement produces only forced sub-Kolmogoroff eddies in the susidiary zone while maintaining a non-turbulent flow. Ultrasonic oscillations (52) may be applied to cause elastohydrodynamic pressure and viscosity increases and/or production of smaller sub-Kolmogoroff eddies. One apparatus includes an inner cylinder rotatable (46) inside a hollow outer cylinder (38), another consists of two circular coaxial plates, and the rotational axis can be vertical or horizontal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with methods and
apparatus for high-shear treatment of flowable materials,
the term high-shear treatment as used herein including both
mixing and milling, the term mixing in turn including
dissolving, suspending and dispersing, and the term milling
in turn including grinding, comminuting and deagglomerating.
The flowable materials employed each comprise at least two
components, one of which is a liquid. The invention is
concerned more especially, but not exclusively, with such
methods and apparatus in which the flowable materials
comprise slurry suspensions of finely divided ceramic
materials.Increasingly a number of manufacturing processes
require the use of finely divided starting materials of, for
example, particle size less than 5 microns, frequently of
particle size less than 1 micron, and increasingly of
particle size as small as 0.1 micron. This is particularly
the case with processes for ceramics, where the use of such
finely-divided raw materials makes it possible to produce
articles having improved properties, such as improved
strength, mechanical and thermal shock resistance, and of
maximum or near maximum theoretical density after firing or
sintering. The particle size distribution is also an
increasingly important criterion, and particularly the
requirement that all of the particles are of a size within a 
narrow range about the nominal value. In industrial
practice the achievement of such uniformity of particle size
is extremely difficult and considerably increases the cost
of production.For example, the manufacture of a ceramic part may
require that the starting material be of average particle
size 0.3 micron and maximum particle size 1.0 micron, such a
small maximum size being necessary to permit, for example,
the part to be superplastically forged. It is expected
that the particle size distribution will have the typical
bell-shape characteristic, with the majority of the material
(e.g. about 70% by weight) of about the average size, while
small portions (e.g. about 15% each) are oversize and
undersize. Even though the material was milled to be of
that average size, it is unlikely that as received by its
ultimate user it is still in the same state of relatively
uniform fine division, since with all particles, and
particularly with such fine particles, agglomeration begins
immediately the powder leaves the grinding mill, and
continues during subsequent handling. Frequently the
powders are pelletized to facilitate their transport and
handling, and must

Methods for high-shear treatment of flowable
materials comprising at least two components, one of which

is a liquid, the methods comprising:

passing the material to be treated in a flow
direction in a flow path constituted by a passage (42 or

116) between two closely spaced passage surfaces (40,44 or
102,108 respectively) provided by respective mill members

(38,46 or 100,106 respectively), the passage having an inlet
(68) thereto and an outlet (70) therefrom;

characterised in that:
the flow path includes an overall high-shear
treatment zone in which the spacing between the passage

surfaces (40,44 or 102,108) allows the coexistence of free
supra-Kolmogoroff eddies which are larger than the smallest

Kolmogoroff eddy diameter for the flowing material and
forced sub-Kolmogoroff eddies which are smaller than the

smallest Kolmogoroff eddy diameter;
the overall high-shear treatment zone includes at
least a portion thereof in which the passage spacing is

smaller than in the remainder of the zone to provide a
subsidiary higher-shear treatment zone in which free supra-Kolmogoroff

eddies are suppressed during passage of the
material therethrough; and
while the material is moving in the overall high-shear
treatment zone the mill members are moved relative to

one another to thereby move the mill passage surfaces (40,44

relatively moving passage surfaces (40,44 or 102,108), so as
