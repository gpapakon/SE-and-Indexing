<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an arrangement for shutting off the filler pipe (20) of a motor vehicle tank of which the end (22) is arranged in a cavity (14) of the bodywork (10), of the type including a flap (18) which is mounted so that it can move between an open position allowing access to the end (22) of the filler pipe (20), and a closed position in which the flap covers over the open face (16) of the cavity (14), which has a cap (26) on its internal face for sealing off the end (22) of the filler pipe (20) and which includes means (56) for locking the flap (18) in the closed position, characterised in that it includes disengageable means (48, 52) for connecting the cap (26) to the flap (18) which are uncoupled when the flap (18) is in the closed and locked position and the coupling of which is brought about by locking the flap (18).

Arrangement for closing off the filler pipe (20) of a 
motor vehicle tank whose end (22) is arranged in a cavity (14) 

in the bodywork (10), of the type having a flap (18) which is 
mounted so as to move between an open position leaving clear 

the access to the end (22) of the filler pipe (20) and a 
closed position in which the flap conceals the open face (16) 

of the cavity (14), which carries on its internal face a plug 
(26) for closing off the end (22) of the filler pipe (20), and 

which has means (56) for locking the flap (18) in the closed 
position, characterised in that it includes disengageable 

means (48, 52) for connecting the plug (26) with the flap (18) 
which are uncoupled when the flap (18) is in the closed 

position and locked and whose coupling is controlled by the 
locking of the flap (18). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the plug (26)
 is mounted so as to be movable in rotation with 
respect to the flap (18) between a position closing off the 

end (22) of the pipe and an open position, the rotation of the 
plug (26) being controlled by the actuation of the said 

locking means, and in that the disconnectable means for 
connecting the plug (26) with the flap (18) are means of 

connection by cooperation of shapes (48, 52) which are 
uncoupled when the plug (26) is in the closing-off position 

and which are coupled when the plug (26) is in the open 
position. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the locking means include a rotary control member (38) which 

is connected with respect to rotation to the body (26) of the 
plug, which controls the movements of a locking member (56) 

for the flap (18) mounted so as to move with respect to the 
latter, and one end (40) of which passes through the flap (18) 

so as to be accessible from the external face of the flap.  
 
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the rotary control member is a control bolt (38). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the said end (40) of the rotary control 

member (38) is rotationally and slidably mounted in a guide 
sleeve (44) formed in the flap (18). 
Arrangement according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the means of connection by cooperation 

of shapes include at least one radial connection arm (46) 
connected with respect to rotation to the said rotary control 

member (38) with respect to which it extends radially and 
whose end (48) is able to cooperate with a part (52) formed on 

the flap (18), when the plug (26) is occupying its open 
position. 
Arrangement according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the end of the arm has a circular mortice (48) which is able 

to receive a complementary tenon (52) formed on the internal 
face (19) of the flap (18). 
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
the connection means include two diametrically opposite radial 

arms (46), and in that the internal face (19) of the flap has 
two diametrically opposite tenons (52). 
Arrangement according to any one of Claims 3 to 8, 
characterised in that the said locking member is a locking 

latch (56) which is mounted so as to move in translation on 
the flap (18), in a direction substantially parallel to the 

plane of the flap, between a locking position in which it is 
received in a keeper (63) formed in the cavity (14) and a 

position of unlocking of the flap.  
 
Arrangement according to Claim 9, characterised in that 
the latch (56, 62) has a control pin (66) which is received in 

a groove (68) forming a control cam arranged in an element 
(36, 46) connected with respect to rotation to the said rotary 

control member (38). 
Arrangement according to Claim 10 taken in combination 
with any one of Claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the 

groove (68) is formed in one face of a connecting arm (46) 
turned towards the flap (18). 
Arrangement according to any one of Claims 3 to 11, 
characterised in that it includes means of immobilisation (78, 

74) in the coupled position of the disconnectable connection 
means (48, 52), when the flap (18) is in the open position. 
Arrangement according to Claim 12 taken in combination 
with one of Claims 10 or 11, characterised in that the 

immobilisation means include an immobilisation member (78) 
which cooperates with the locking latch (56, 74) in order to 

immobilise the latter in the unlocked position when the flap 
is open. 
Arrangement according to Claim 13, characterised in that 
the immobilisation member is an immobilisation lever (78), a 

first end (76) of which is forced elastically (82) in the 
direction of an immobilisation recess (74) formed in the body 

(58) of the locking latch (56, 62) and in which it (76) is 
received when the latter (56) is in the unlocked position, and 

the second end (84) of which is able to cooperate with a 
release stop (86) formed in the cavity (14), when the flap 

(18) is in the closed position, in order to bring about the 
escape of the first end (76) out of the immobilisation recess 

(74), counter to the elastic return force (82).  
 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the plug (26) includes hooking means (30, 32) which cooperate 

with complementary means (34) arranged at the end (22) of the 
filler pipe (20) in order to immobilise the plug (26) axially 

with respect to the pipe (20) when it is occupying its 
closing-off position. 
Arrangement according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the flap (18) is mounted articulated on 

the bodywork about a pivot axis (54) substantially parallel to 
the plane of the flap.
