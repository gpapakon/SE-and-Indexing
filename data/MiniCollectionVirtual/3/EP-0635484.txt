<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process for the preparation of 
acrylamide. Acrylonitrile is treated through at least 

two purification steps in which acrylonitrile is brought 
into contact with a strongly-acidic cation exchange resin 

and then with a resin having primary and/or secondary 
amino groups or with activated carbon. The resulting 

acrylonitrile is subjected to hydration in the presence 
of a copper-based catalyst. The process of this 

invention can provide high-quality acrylamide even when 
acrylonitrile of ordinary quality is used, and permits 

preparation of a polyacrylamide suitable for use in the 
production of a coagulant having good water solubility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing 
acrylamide by subjecting acrylonitrile to catalytic 
hydration with water in the presence of a copper-base 
catalyst. More specifically, this invention is concerned 
with a purification process for acrylonitrile 
useful as a raw material for the preparation of high-quality 
acrylamide which permits production of a 
polymer having sufficiently high molecular weight and 
also good water-solubility. Acrylamide has long been used in the form of 
acrylamide polymers as papermaking chemicals, flocculants, 
oil recovery agents and the like and has also 
found wide-spread utility as a raw material comonomer 
for various polymers. As a preparation process of 
acrylamide for such applications, the so-called sulfuric 
acid process was used in the past but in recent 
years, catalytic processes featuring a reaction in the 
presence of a copper-base catalyst have been developed 
and are now industrially practised in place of the sulfuric 
process.  
 Among the above-described applications of 
acrylamide, flocculants in particular have found utility 
expanded to the treatment of effluent and the like 
in recent years. Keeping step with this, a great deal 
of efforts are now under way for the improvement of 
their quality and performance. Of these, there is a 
marked tendency toward high-molecular acrylamide 
polymers for use as flocculants because they are said 
to exhibit better performance as their molecular 
weights become higher. Recently, those having a high 
molecular weight of 10,000,000 or higher, especially of 
about 15,000,000 are demanded. Compared with the fact 
that the molecular weight required for an acrylamide 
polymer or other polymers employed for other applications 
is generally 1,000,000 or lower, this molecular 
weight is far higher. In addition, the acrylamide 
polymer so obtained is required to promptly dissolve in 
water without leaving any insoluble matter behind because 
it is usually employed as a flocculant in a form 
dissolved in water. In view of the toxicity of acrylamide 
monomer, the unreacted monomer contained in each 
polymer is required to be in a trace amount, for example, 
not greater than 0.2 wt.%. These requirements are contradictory to the 
demand for higher molecular weight so that tremendous  
 
efforts have been made to achieve them. Although such 
high-molecular acrylamide polymers constitute only one 
example of applications of acrylamide, they cannot be 
furnished for a wide variety of general applications 
unless they
