<ABSTRACT>
Device for distributing and dispensing liquid within a water treatment unit containing a filter material, characterised in that it includes especially a tray (1) separating the treatment unit into an upstream zone (5) containing the filter material (7) and a downstream zone (6) provided with at least two separate parts forming distribution networks, one of them being pierced with a plurality of orifices (2, 3) which allow the treated fluid which has passed through the filter material (7) to flow between the upstream zone (5) and the downstream zone (6), which communicate, by means of a distribution orifice (11) which can be shut off as a function of the direction of flow of the fluid, with the second part of the said tray and the network for removal of the treated fluid, the additional part (8) being furthermore provided, on one of the faces of the tray, with a plurality of openings (2, 3) which permit a flow of the regenerating fluid within the said filter material during the regeneration stage, the said regenerating fluid being introduced via the network for draining off the treated fluid.

Distribution and supply device for liquid, within a treatment unit for
water containing a filtering material, characterized in that it comprises,

notably, a plate (1) separating the treatment unit into an upstream zone
(5) containing the filtering material (7) and a downstream zone (6), provided

with at least two distinct parts forming distribution networks, one
of them is perforated by a plurality of orifices (2) which permit the

passage of the created fluid that has passed through the filtering material
(7) between the upstream zone (5) and the downstream zone (6), which

communicate, by means of a supply orifice (11) which can be obturated as a

function of the direction of flow of the fluid, with the second part of said
plate and the discharge network for the treated fluid, the complementary

part (8) being provided, in addition, on one of the faces of the plate (1),
with a plurality of openings (3) which permit a flow of the regenerating

fluid within said filtering material during the regeneration phase, said
regenerating fluid being introduced via the draw-off network for the treated

fluid.
Distribution device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
distribution, over the plate (1), of the orifices (2, 3) disposed between

the upstream zone (5) and the down-stream zone (6) is annular and peripheral,
the diameter and number of these orifices being a function of the hydraulic

characteristics of the filtering material.
Distribution device according to claim 1 or 2. characterized in that
the complementary part (8) of the plate (1), the central part (10), is

sealed from the peripheral part (9), said part (8) being in communication
with the drain-off or discharge network for the treated fluid.
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the plate (1) is situated at the upper part of the

treatment enclosure (4).
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the place (1) is situated in the lower part of the

treatment enclosure (4). 
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the obturatable distribution orifice (11) has a body

(12) such as, notably, a ball, needle or a blade, forming a valve, the
position of this body (12) relative to the seating of the orifice being

determined according to the use of the apparatus.
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that there are disposed, in one of the discs of the plate

(1), notably the upper disc, and around the draw-off duct for the fluid, a
plurality of orifices (3) of a diameter different from those (2) placed in

the peripheral part (9) of the plate (1).
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the orifices (3) are connected to one another by

concentric and/or radial grooves (13), in this way defining a grid network
adapted for uniformly diffusing the regeneration fluid.
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the orifices (2, 3) for diffusing the brine through

the resin are replaced by strainers or by a star-shaped network of channels.
Distribution device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it allows a counter-flow or parallel-flow circulation

of the regenerating fluid.
