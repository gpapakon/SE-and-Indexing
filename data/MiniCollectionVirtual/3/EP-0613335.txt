<ABSTRACT>
A socket for testing integrated circuit (IC) packages (100) 
has a lower block (10) with a plurality of contact elements (11) 

movable between open and closed positions mounted therein, an 
upper block (20) fixed on the lower block (10) and formed with a 

lead insertion hole (21) for the insertion of each lead (101) of 
the IC package (100) at the corresponding location of the contact 

elements (11), a cover member (30) adapted for vertical, up and 
down movement relative to the upper block (20), and a slide block 

(40) mounted to slidably reciprocate in a recess formed between 
the upper and lower blocks (10, 20) in a direction which crosses, 

at approximately a right angle, the direction in which a lead 
(101) of an IC package (100) would be inserted into an opened 

contact element (11). The slide block (40) has a plurality of 
apertures (41) for opening and closing contact elements (11) in 

response to the slide position relative to the contact elements 
(11) and a contact parts opening and closing mechanism (50) which 

transmits force from the vertical movement of the cover member 

(30) to the slide block (40) to move the slide block in one 
direction against the bias of a spring (42) which provides a 

force to move the slide block in the opposite direction. When 
each lead (101) of the IC package (100) which has been loaded on 

the upper block (20) is inserted into a respective open contact 
part (110) of a contact element (11) through the lead insertion 

hole (21) of the upper block (20) and the contact part (110) has 
been closed by the moving action of the slide block (40), the 

inserted leads (101) are connected to the contact elements (11) 
through engagement with the contact parts (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a socket adapted to 
receive an IC package (semiconductor integrated circuit package) 
for conducting selected burn-in tests and the like of the IC 
package. In connection with a heat resistance test, a so called 
burn-in test, or the like of IC packages such as PGA (Pin Grid 
Array), the IC package is loaded on a circuit substrate (printed 
substrate) through a socket and then put into a heating furnace 
for testing its suitability. Sockets for testing of an IC package, as described above, 
having structures described in Figs. 1 and 2 are known. This 
prior art socket is generally constructed having a lower base 1 
on which a plurality of contact elements 2, corresponding to the 
IC leads, are disposed both on the upper and lower surfaces, an 
upper body 3 which has been assembled in such a way as to slide 
in a direction indicated by arrow 3d shown on the lower base 1 
and a lever 4 coupled to upper body 3 and operable to cause 
sliding movement of upper body 3. Lead insertion holes 3a for the IC leads are formed through 
the upper body 3 corresponding to the various contact elements 2.  
 
Lever 4 is configured approximately in the shape of an L with one 
of the legs 4a serving as a base supported on the lower base 1 
and the other leg serving as handle part 4b extending from one 
side of the lower base 1. At the center of base 4a an offset part 4c is formed for 
engaging and transmitting a force to the upper body 3 in the 
direction of movement. Part 4c is offset a distance d relative 
to the longitudinal axis of the base 4a and its offset part is 
inserted into a groove 3b of the upper body 3. The central part 
of the upper body 3 is recessed on its top surface forming a 
rectangular window for reception of an IC package to be loaded 
therein. The IC package to be loaded in the test socket shown in 
Figs. 1 and 2 is a PGA, to cite as an example, as shown in Figs. 
3a and 3b, with a plurality of leads 101 extending out of the 
bottom of the resin-sealed main body 100 along the sides thereof. If the handle part 4b of the lever 4 is rotated in a 
direction indicated by arrow 4d in Fig. 2 after the IC package 
has been placed in the opening of the upper body 3 and its leads 
101 have been inserted into respective insertion holes 3a of the 
upper body 3 in the prior art structure, the upper body 3 is 
engaged and biased by the offset part 4c of the lever 4 and, 
along with its rotary movement, it moves to the left as indicated 
by arrow 3d in Fig. 2. On the inner

A socket comprising a lower block (10) bearing a 
plurality of contact elements (11), each having a contact 

part (110) movable between an opened position in which a 
lead of an IC package to be fitted on the socket can be 

inserted in a first direction into the particular contact 
part of a respective contact element and a closed position 

in which the IC lead is electrically connected to the 
particular contact part, an upper block (20) fixed on the 

lower block and having formed therethrough in alignment 
with respective contact elements lead insertion holes (21) 

for receiving respective leads of an IC package, a slide 
block (40) mounted to slide in reciprocating motion in a 

direction which crosses the first direction and having a 
plurality of apertures (41) formed therethrough at 

locations respectively corresponding to the positions of 
the contact elements for opening and closing each contact 

part of the contact elements in dependence upon the 
location of the slide block, each contact element being 

received in one of the aperture of the slide block, and a 
contact parts opening and closing mechanism (30,50) that 

causes a slide movement of the slide block,
 
   characterised in that the contact parts opening and 

closing mechanism (30,50) is formed by a lever (52) which 
is freely rotatable about an axis (51) in the socket, the 

lever having a lever arm extending from a base portion and 
having a free distal end (520) and a cover member (30) 

supported on the free distal end (520), the base portion 
having an engagement portion (53) disposed at a selected 

distance from the axis which engages and moves the slide 
block (40) in one direction by the rotation of the lever 

base portion in one direction and which releases the 
engagement portion (53) by a rotary return in an opposite 

direction, the vertical movement of the cover member (30) 
being converted into a straight line sliding action of the  

 
slide block (40) and, at the same time, the contact parts 

are opened and closed by the said sliding action. 
A socket according to claim 1 in which the contact 
part (110) of each contact element (11) is bifurcated into 

first and second contact pieces (112,111), the first piece 
(112) is engaged by an edge portion of the lead insertion 

hole of the upper block (20) and the second contact piece 
(111) is engageable with a surface (413) defining a 

respective aperture and displaced in a direction to 
separate the second contact piece from the first contact 

piece when the surface of the respective aperture moves in 
the said direction by sliding of the slide block (40). 
A socket according to claim 2 in which the shape of 
the two contact pieces (111,112) of each contact part 

(110) includes a sharp edge portion which engages the outer 
layer of an IC lead received between the contact pieces 
to

(53) is supported at a location which is offset from the 

first shaft (51) on the lever base portion, the slide block 
(40) is engaged and moved in one direction by a force 

transmitted through the rotation of the second shaft (53) 
about the first shaft (51) as the lever base portion makes 

a rotation in one direction and the force is removed by the 
rotary return of the lever base portion and the second 

shaft (53) in an opposite direction.  
 
A socket according to claim 5 wherein the length 
between the axis and the free distal end of the lever arm 

which engages the cover member is expressed by
