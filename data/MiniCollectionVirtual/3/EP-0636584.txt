<ABSTRACT>
Process for vitrification of solid residues and a device for making use of this process, and the product originating from this process and/or from this device. According to this vitrification process, a mixture of two immiscible molten liquids is formed, sufficiently viscous in order that after quenching a vitreous matrix may be obtained in which the substances capable of polluting the environment are trapped. This process makes it possible in particular to treat the solid residues originating from the burning of household and/or industrial waste.

<CLAIMS>
Method of vitrification of solid residues issued from the incineration of
household and/or industrial waste, of the type consisting in:


melting the solid residues with or without a fusion additive in a melting
furnace (3),
condensing the vaporized salts carried along in the gases issued from
this melting,
separating, from the gaseous phase, the condensed salts by a separation
means (6),

characterized in that one mixes in a mixer (7) located downstream of the
melting furnace (3), the products issued from the said separation means (6)

with the molten liquid issued from the melting furnace (3).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that prior to the filtration
step, one carries out a step for the neutralization of the acid gases and

for the condensation-adsorption of the heavy gaseous metals.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in addition the
vaporized salts carried along in the gases issued from the mixer (7) are

also condensed and separated from the gaseous phase by the separation
means (6).
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that one
only melts the solid residues in the melting furnace (3) and in that one

uses no fusion additive.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that one
uses a fusion additive which is admixed to the solid residues before the 

melting step in the melting furnace (3), this additive then being an
additive the dry mass of which consists of at least 60 % by weight of a

mixture M
1
 of silicon oxide, aluminium oxide and calcium oxide.
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that the aforesaid mixture
M
1
 comprises between about 55 % and about 75 % by weight of SiO
2
,
between about 5 % and about 30 % by weight of Al
2
O
3
 and between
about 5 % and about 35% by weight of CaO.
Method according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the additive is
selected among clinker, pozzolana and basalt.
Device for carrying out a method of vitrification of solid residues issued
from the incineration of household and/or industrial waste, of the type

comprising a silo (1) for the storage and feeding of the products to be

vitrified, a melting furnace (3) and means (6) for the separation of the
particles contained in the gaseous phase issued from the melting furnace

(3), characterized in that between the melting furnace (3) and the said
separation means (6), one interposes a system (4) for the quenching, for

example with air, of the gaseous effluents issued from the melting
furnace (3) and in that it in addition comprises a mixer (7) connected on

the one hand to the melting furnace (3) and on the other hand to the
separation means (6), in which mixer (7) are mixed the molten liquid

collected underneath the melting furnace (3) and the solid particles
connected underneath the separation means (6), this mixer (7) being

followed by a system for the quenching for example with water of this
molten mixture.
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that between the
quenching system (4) and the separation means (6), there is provided a

system (5) for the neutralization of the acid gases by an alcaline solid
reagent and for the condensation-adsorption of the heavy metals. 
Device according to any one of claims 8 or 9, characterized in that the
mixer (7) in addition comprises a duct for the discharge of the gases

formed in this mixer, this duct being connected to the separation means
(6) directly or through the medium of the neutralization system (5).
Device according to any one of claims 8 to 10, characterized in that
there is in addition provided a second silo (2) for the storage and feeding

with fusion additive connected to the melting furnace (3).
