<ABSTRACT>
Pump (1) includes a pneumatic valve assembly (98) having a chamber (105) which is supplied by compressed air via an inlet pipe. Included within chamber (105) is a valve (109) which includes a chamber (111) divided into two separate compartments (112, 113) by a pliant diaphragm (114). Diaphragm (114) is biased toward compartment (112) by a spring (115) and supports a plunger (116) which extends from chamber (111) and includes a frusto conical end (117) for selectively engaging seat face (99) and preventing air flow between chambers (105, 90). Two air bleed passageways (119, 120) respectively extend from chamber (90) and compartment (113) to atmosphere for allowing a gradual return to atmospheric pressure therein when the supply of compressed air to the respective chamber and compartment is discontinued. A further bleed passageway (121) extends through diaphragm (114) to ensure a gradual equalisation of pressure in both compartments (112, 113) such that the diaphragm will eventually return to its original biased position. An aperture (125) extends between compartment (112) and chamber (91) for allowing fluidic communication therebetween. Aperture (125) is selectively covered by a switch mechanism (126) to prevent fluid flow therethrough. Switch mechanism (126) selectively opens valve assembly (98) in response to liquid filling sump (6) and raising float (42) to an operative position. This allows compressed air to pressurise sump (6) and evacuate fluid from sump (6) via outlet pipe (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic pump
and in particular to a valve assembly.The invention has been developed primarily for use
in removing water from mining excavations and will be
described hereinafter with reference to that
application. However, it will be appreciated that the
invention is not limited to this particular field of use
and is also suitable for pumping water and other fluids
from wells, tanks and other reservoirs.Hitherto, pneumatically operated pumps for use in
mining applications have generally included a sump into
which water flows for subsequent propulsion therefrom by
an impeller or double acting diaphragm which is driven
by compressed air. It is standard practice to leave 
such pumps running continuously to ensure a substantially
water free mining environment at all times. However, such
a mode of operation leads to high levels of wear and
failure, especially when water is not passing into the
sump.Automatic control systems and valves have been
contemplated, however these involve complicated switching
systems which due to their intricate nature are not
suitably durable for use in a mining environment.Moreover, to leave such pump running dry is highly
inefficient since each pump requires 50 to 100 cubic feet
of compressed air per minute, the large majority of which
is wasted. These pumps are also bulky and cumbersome and
as such difficult to move in the confined spaces in a mine.Prior art pumps and the valve systems used therein are
generally expensive to produce, require a relatively large
number of moving parts, and incorporate a large number of
aluminium components which are readily corroded by the
alkaline or acidic waters often encountered.US-A- 4 060 370 discloses a valve assembly having the precharacterising
features of claim 1.According to a first aspect of the invention there is
provided a valve assembly for selectively supplying a fluid
through a passageway having a first seat face, said valve
assembly including:
a valve chamber divided into a first and a second
compartment by a first pliant diaphragm and including a
port, said first diaphragm being biased toward said first
compartment; a plunger extending between a first end disposed
inside said chamber and a second end disposed outside side
chamber, said plunger being moveable in response to
movement of said first diaphragm for selectively sealingly
engaging said first seat face within said second end,
wherein said plunger extends through and sealingly engages
said passageway;an aperture extending between said

<CLAIMS>
A valve assembly (98) for selectively supplying a
fluid through a passageway (100) having a first seat face

(99), said valve assembly including:

a valve chamber (111) divided into a first (112) and
a second (113) compartment by a first pliant diaphragm

(114) and including a port (120), said first diaphragm
(114) being biased toward said first compartment (112);
a plunger (116) extending between a first end (117)
disposed inside said chamber (111) and a second end (118)

disposed outside said chamber (111), said plunger (116)
being moveable in response to movement of said first

diaphragm (114) for selectively sealingly engaging said
first seat face (99) within said second end (118), wherein

said plunger (116) extends through and sealingly engages
said passageway (100);
an aperture (125) extending between said first
compartment (112) and a chamber (91) upstream of said first

seat face (99) for allowing fluidic communication
therebetween;
a pilot valve (136) biased toward a closed position
over said aperture (125) and selectively moveable into an

open position for allowing the fluid to enter said valve
chamber (111) and move said first diaphragm (114) against

said bias and thereby withdraw said second end (118) of
said plunger (116) from said first seat face (99);
a switching means for selectively progressing said
pilot valve (136) against said bias into the open position;

characterised in that the valve assembly further includes

a bleed passage (121) extending between said first
(112) and second (113) compartments for allowing gradual

equalisation of fluidic pressure therebetween, whereby
movement of said pilot valve (136) into the closed position

effects a delayed presentation of said plunger (116) to
said first seat face (99);
 
and in that said pilot valve (136) is mounted about an axis for

rotation (130) between the open and closed positions and
includes a first magnetic device (134) disposed outwardly

of said axis, said switching means including a second
magnetic device (51) which is selectively presented into an

interactive disposition with respect to said first device
(134) for attracting said first device (134) theretoward

and thereby moving said pilot valve (136) toward the open
position.
