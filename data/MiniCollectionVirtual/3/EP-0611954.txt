<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure sets forth a diver's gauge boot 
having a first portion for receipt of a depth gauge and second 

portion for receiving a tank pressure gauge therein, with a 
sleeve for connecting the tank pressure gauge into a high 

pressure hose adapted for connection to a tank for indicating 
pressure in the tank, and a rotational connector between the 

first portion and the second portion with a pocket in the 
second portion for receiving a second instrument on a side of 

said second portion disposed away from said tank pressure 
gauge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is within the diver's 
gauge art. More particularly, it pertains to instruments and 
gauges that are maintained in a single grouping or array to 
provide for multiple instrument and gauge readings. The 
gauges and instruments can be in the form of a breathing gas 
tank pressure gauge, a depth gauge, a timer, and a compass.  
 Diver's gauges and instruments enclosed in boots are 
used by divers for among other things to determine depth. 
Such depth gauges can be in the form of an analog gauge having 
a bourdon tube meter which responds to various depths. Other 
gauges can also provide depth readings in the form of digital 
electronic readouts that correspond to depth based upon a 
transducer sensing a particular depth. Other gauges include gauges connected to a diver's 
breathing gas tank. Such gauges including bourdon tube gauges 
determine the tank pressure so that the diver can determine 
how much breathing gas is left in the tank. These pressure 
gauges for reading tank pressure can also be based upon a 
transducer sensing tank pressure and providing an electronic 
readout. It is also customary for divers to utilize a compass 
for determining bearing and location when undertaking a dive, 
as well as watches and timers. The foregoing gauges, instruments and components 
have been combined as a single unit providing the foregoing 
readings and information. The units are oftentimes referred 
to as dive consoles or boots in which to hold the respective 
gauges, components, instruments, and compass.  
 Such gauge boots are generally connected to a tank of breathing 
gas by means of a hose. The hose is generally in the form of a high 
pressure hose which is connected directly to the pressure of the 
tank. The high pressure hose at the other end is in turn connected 
to a tank pressure gauge. The gauge indicates the amount or pressure 
of the gas and corresponds to the gas remaining in the tank. Since diving requirements are such wherein tank pressure must 
be read, the utilization of a high pressure hose connected to the 
tank pressure gauge is usually a requisite of any dive gauge boot 
containing a plurality of gauges. As a consequence, the boot is 
usually such wherein it is tethered or connected to the tank by means 
of the high pressure hose. A second gauge in the form of a depth gauge is also utilized. 
The depth gauge indicates to the diver the degree of depth the diver 
has descended to. The information is quite critical to the diver. 
The depth gauge is also often seated

<CLAIMS>
A gauge boot (10) for a diving apparatus comprising: 

a first portion (18) of said gauge boot (10) having a depth gauge (34) 
therein; 
a second portion (20) of said gauge boot (10) having a tank pressure 
gauge (50) therein with a connection means (14) adapted for connection to a 

tank of breathing gas, 
as well as a second instrument (52) therein; 
 
   characterized that 

the second instrument (52) is positioned on the opposite 
side from said tank pressure gauge (50), and the gauge boot (10) includes means for 

rotationally mounting said second portion (20) to said first portion (18) so 
that said depth gauge (34) can he turned to be read in combination with 

said tank pressure gauge (50) or the second instrument (52). 
The gauge boot as claimed in claim 1 further characterized 
by said gauge boot (10) being formed of an elastomeric material. 
The gauge boot as claimed in claim 1 or 2 further 
characterized by said second instrument in said second portion (20) being 

a compass (52). 
The gauge boot as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3 further 
characterized by a slot (42) within a side wall of said gauge boot (10) having 

an opening therein and a pin (44) extending across said opening for 
receipt of a lanyard thereby.  

 
The gauge boot as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4 further 
characterized by rotational connection means formed as a T shaped 

extension (86) from one of said portions of said gauge boot (10), and means for 
receiving (94, 96) said T shape portion in the other portion of said gauge 

boot. 
The gauge boot as claimed in claim 5 further characterized 
by said extension comprising a T shaped member (86) having a cavity (88) 

therein with a groove (92), and the portion for receiving said T shaped 
extension includes a bore (94) and a stepped groove (96) for receiving the 

transverse portion of said T shaped member and having a grommet (100) for 
expanding the groove of said T shaped member into said stepped 

groove. 
The gauge boot as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6 further 
characterized by including a detent means (142) on one of said portions for 

engaging at least one groove (140) on the other portion to index rotation 
beyond a given point of one portion with respect to the other 

portion. 
The gauge boot as claimed in claim 7 further characterized 
by said detent means being a slot on said first portion (10) and a detent 

extending from said second portion (20), and wherein the point of contact 
between said first and second portions is a rounded walled 

curvilinear portion for receipt within a partial arcuate wall. 
The gauge boot as claimed in claim 8 further characterized 
by said depth gauge (34) being mounted within said first portion (18) so as to
