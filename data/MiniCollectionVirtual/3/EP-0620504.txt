<ABSTRACT>
The method of recovery from a jam of a copy sheet in a clearance zone in an image 
processing machine including the steps of determining the position of the copy sheet and a 

following copy sheet in the copy sheet path, recognizing that the following copy sheet is within 
a second clearance zone, calculating a time period to continue machine operation to drive the 

following copy sheet into the first clearance zone, and determining that said time period does 
not exceed a maximum time period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to jam clearance in an image processing apparatus and, more
particularly, to selective options in jam clearance including the timing control of a copy sheet
drive for single zone jam clearance.In using reproduction machines, there are various types of system shut downs or
malfunctions that can occur in a variety of operating modes. Operator involvement in
correcting for the malfunction can often be extensive particularly in machines with various
accessories such as sorters, collators, finishers and document handlers. The problem of
correcting the malfunction, maintaining the integrity of the run in process, and minimizing
down time and operator involvement can be significant.Jam recovery and associated job recovery in many present copiers often requires the
removal of documents or copy sheets stopped in several places in the machine even if the jam
occurred in only one location to only one document. Jam recovery also often requires the
reordering of documents as well as the purging of some or all of copies in process in the
machine. This can be a time consuming and inefficient operation.Various techniques of jam clearance exist in the prior art. For example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,627,711 to Schron, assigned to Xerox Corporation, discloses a control system for
controlling the shutdown of a paper path system in a copy machine when a paper handling
fault occurs. Upon detecting a malfunction or jam, the control system evaluates the status of
all sheets in a sheet handling system and makes determinations whether to hold sheets from
entering into a boundary between two zones or to drive a sheet at a boundary into a next
zone.U.S. Patent No. 4,786,041 to Acquaviva et al., assigned to Xerox Corporation, discloses
a document handler jam clearance and job recovery system. Upon the occurrence of a paper
jam, the system determines whether a document has jammed in a first, second or third
document path jam zone and automatically provides a preliminary job recovery operation
before the document handler is fully stopped. Document feeding zones are independently
operated to feed unjammed documents in a third jam zone to a stacking tray or to feed
unjammed documents in the third jam zone to a stacking tray or to feed unjammed documents
in the first jam zone to a platen, so that documents are directed to be operator removed from
only one zone.One difficulty in prior art devices is that independent control of more than one copy
sheet drive is often required or that the copy sheets need to be

<CLAIMS>
A method of recovery from a copy sheet jam in an image
processing apparatus for producing images on copy sheets,

the apparatus including a copy sheet path having a
plurality of zones, a copy sheet drive, and a controller

for directing the image processing apparatus, wherein at
least one in-process copy sheet is disposed along said

copy sheet path, the method comprising:

monitoring the location of the in-process copy sheet
within the plurality of zones;
detecting a machine malfunction;
responding to the malfunction and to the location of
the in-process copy sheet to operate the copy sheet drive

for a given period of time dependent upon the location of
the in-process copy sheet with respect to a given zone; and
positioning the in-process copy sheet within the copy
sheet path for access from said given zone;

   characterised in that the method also includes the
step of determining the degree of restraint of the in-process

copy sheet within another zone and taking account
of this in the said operation of the copy sheet drive.
The method of claim 1, wherein the in-process copy
sheet extends from said given zone to another zone wherein

the step of repositioning the in-process copy sheet within
the copy sheet path for access from said given zone

includes the step of removing the in-process copy sheet
from the copy sheet path via said given zone.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the step of
determining the degree of restraint of the in-process copy

sheet within said another zone includes the step of
determining the degree of grip of the in-process copy sheet

within a sheet drive nip. 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein one of
the zones is the paper path from a transfer station to an

output tray.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein one of
the zones is the paper path from a copy sheet supply to a

sheet registration location.
