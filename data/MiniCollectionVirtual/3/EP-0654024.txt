 2-THIOI DOLES (SELENOINDOLES) AND RELATED DISULFIDES (SELENIDES) WHICH INHIBIT PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASES AND WHICH HAVE ANTITUMOR PROPERTIESCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application U.S. Serial Number 926,015, filed August 6, 1992.FIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to substituted 2-thioindoles (selenoindoles) and other related compounds, which we have unexpectedly found to be potent inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGF-TK) and other protein tyrosine kinases, and which show antitumor activity. The invention also relates to use of the compounds as inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases and as antitumor agents.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProtein phosphorylation is a critical mechanism for regulating protein function in the signal transduction pathway in normal and transformed cells.Protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are an important class of phosphorylating enzymes which mediate this signalling and thereby regulate cell growth and proliferation. PTKs catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to the phenol of tyrosine in substrate proteins. Some growth factor receptors, 

protooncogenes and oncogene products possess PTK activity. The overexpression or inappropriate expression of normal or mutant kinases can result in the loss of growth control and the unregulated cell proliferation associated with malignancy. Small molecules which selectively inhibit these enzymes are, therefore, of therapeutic interest as mediators of cell growth and as antitumor agents.In some growth factor dependent tumors, the growth factor signal transduction pathway employs the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the growth factor receptor for autophosphorylation and the phosphoryla- tion of specific cellular proteins involved in mitogenesis and cell proliferation. Specific inhibitors of PTKs have_been identified previously. It has been previously demonstrated that by uncoupling the PTK from the signal transduction pathway, inhibitors of the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases result therapeutically in antitumor activity. This antitumor activity has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Most known tyrosine kinase inhibitors are styrene-like small molecules in which the aromatic ring is hydroxylated, resembling tyrosine itself.For example, the EGF-TK inhibitor erbstatin is reported to inhibit the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells with an IC50 = 3.6 μg/mL (J. Antibiot. 1986;39:170) .
