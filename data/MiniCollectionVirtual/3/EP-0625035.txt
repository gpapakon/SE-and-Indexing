Process for producing a flexible, planar carrier 
coated with a microporous adhesive layer, characterized 

in that 

a) a flowable adhesive composition is applied onto an 
intermediate carrier having the following 

properties: 

it has an undulating, pleated, fissured or 
furrowed surface detectable under an optical or 

electron microscope 
the adhesive composition can be easily detached 
from the surface thereof 
it is essentially air-impermeable, 
 
on application, the adhesive composition not 

completely filling the depressions of the 
intermediate carrier, 
b) the microscopic air or solvent inclusions resulting, 
after coating the intermediate carrier, between the 

adhesive composition and the intermediate carrier 
are expanded by increasing the temperature until the 

surface of the adhesive composition bursts, and 
c) the adhesive composition is subsequently transferred 
from the intermediate carrier onto the final carrier. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an intermediate carrier is used which is produced by 

applying plastic in liquid form by means of a surface-structured 
device onto a flexible basic body. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the surface-structured device is an absorbent 

device. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the surface-structured device used is a porous 

device, in particular a foam roll or a circulating foam 
belt. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an intermediate carrier is used, which is produced 

by applying plastic in liquid form onto a flexible basic 
body, the plastic, before curing, being provided with a  

 
surface structure by means of a surface-structured 

device. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an intermediate carrier is used, which is produced 

by applying plastic to a flexible basic body by 
conventional spraying processes, the plastic being 

provided with a surface structure by means of a surface-structured 
device. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the surface-structured device used is an absorbent 

device. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the surface-structured device used is a porous 

device, in particular a foam roll or a circulating foam 
belt. 
Use of a flexible, planar carrier obtained by a 
process according to one of claims 1-8 and coated with a 

microporous adhesive layer, as a medical plaster. 
Process for producing an intermediate carrier for 

use in a process according to Claim 1-8, characterized in 
that a plastic which is present in liquid form and repels 

adhesive is applied onto a flexible basic body by means 
of a surface-structured device, in particular a porous 

device, for example a foam roll, an intermediate carrier 
having the following properties being obtained: 


it has an undulating, pleated, fissured or furrowed 
surface detectable under an optical or 

electron microscope 
an adhesive composition can be easily detached 
from the surface thereof, and 
it is essentially air-impermeable. 
Process for producing an intermediate carrier 
for use in a process according to Claim 1-8, 

characterized in that a plastic which is present in 
liquid form and repels adhesive is applied onto a 

flexible basic body and the plastic, before curing, is 
provided with a surface structure by means of a surface-structured 

device, in particular a porous device, for 
example a foam roll, an intermediate carrier having the  

 
following properties being obtained: 


it has an undulating, pleated, fissured or furrowed 
surface detectable under an optical or 

electron microscope 
an adhesive composition can be easily detached 
from the surface thereof, and 
it is essentially air-impermeable.
