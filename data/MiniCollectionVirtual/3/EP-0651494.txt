<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an alternator rotor and its 
manufacturing method, said rotor having a first rotor 

member (1) on which a plurality of teeth (11) have been 
formed, plus a second rotor member (2) arranged so that 

its teeth are positioned in the spaces in the cylindrical 
surface formed by the teeth of said first rotor member. 
A cylindrically-shaped magnetic material (20) is cut 
to match the shape of the teeth (11) and is separated into 

a first rotor member (1) and a second rotor member (2). 
A plurality of teeth (11) is formed on the first rotor 

member (1), and teeth are formed on the second rotor 
member (2) so that they are positioned in the spaces in 

the cylindrical surface formed by the teeth of the first 
rotor member. The two rotor members (1,2) are 

mechanically joined by laying each of two rings (8,9) 
across the tips of the teeth (11) of one rotor member and 

across the bases of the teeth of the other rotor member. 
Given this construction and method of manufacture, 
rotors can be manufactured in fewer manhours, electrical 

efficiency can be improved by increasing the number of 
poles, and the incidence of defective products is 

decreased, which means that manufacturing yield can be 
increased. In addition, because the fabrication of the 

teeth (11) can be automated and the welding can be 
performed easily from the outside, fabrication precision 

can be increased and quality stabilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is utilized in the manufacture of alternators, and relates to
auxiliary generators that are linked to the rotation of an internal combustion engine.
It was developed as an alternator for automobiles, but can be utilized for other
alternators as well.Combining two roundel-type poles as the rotor for an alternator is a known
technology. As shown in Fig.11 (sectional view), Fig.12 (perspective view), Fig.13
(side view) and Fig.14 (perspective view), such a rotor has first rotor member 1 on
which a plurality of teeth 11 have been formed, and which is fitted to rotating shaft
3. It also has second rotor member 2 which is formed in the same cylindrical surface
as teeth 11 of said first rotor member 1, and in a shape that will mutually mesh with
said teeth 11. Said second rotor member 2 rotates together with said first rotor
member 1. Field coil 4 is arranged in the space provided between these two rotor
members 1 and 2 and rotating shaft 3, and stator 5 and stator coils 6 are arranged on
the outside of the two rotor members 1 and 2. Second rotor member 2 is welded to
first rotor member 1 on its inside using ring 7 which is made of a non-magnetic
material.Alternators with this construction have come into wide use because of the
superior design which makes slip rings and brushes unnecessary, due to field coil 4
being fixed and not on the rotor side of the device.As explained above, in an alternator rotor with this sort of construction, first
rotor member 1 and second rotor member 2 are manufactured separately and welded
together using ring 7. This ring 7 is formed of a non-magnetic material so that it does
not interfere with the lines of magnetic force that pass between teeth 11. However,
this welding process has a number of drawbacks. It has to be carried out in a narrow
gap, there is a large variability in product shape, and as a matter of course there is an
increased proportion of defective products, so that manufacturing manhours increase.
Another drawback is that expensive equipment such as laser beam welding apparatus
is required.Alternator rotors with this construction have conventionally been manufactured
by hot forging. Namely, first rotor member 1 and second rotor member 2 are forged
separately from steel in such manner that each acquires the desired shape with a
plurality of teeth 11. Such a manufacturing method therefore has the following 
drawbacks: large variability in product shape, increased
proportion of defective products, and increased
manufacturing manhours.Another method of
