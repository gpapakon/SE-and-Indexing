<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric film 
compositions; more particularly the present invention 
relates to polymeric film comprising 
polyepsiloncaprolactam and a 
poly(epsiloncaprolactam/hexamethylene adipamide) 
copolymer which features good thermal stability. Whereas there are known to the art a wide variety 
of films which find great utility, there remain 
particular applications wherein films are subjected to 
conditions which often act to degrade the film's 
compositon and overall performance, an undesired 
effect. There exist applications wherein it is required to 
subject a film to elevated temperatures for a prolonged 
period of time wherein it would be highly desirous that 
the film retain good physical properties, including 
tensile properties throughout the period during which 
the film is subjected to high heat conditions. Such an application is in bag moulding (as described in 
of Polymer Science and Technology "(1st. Ed. 1965). Vol. 2 
pages 300 to 316, where a film encapsulating a curable reinforced 
plastics material has to withstand the extended high temperatures 
of the curing process. Presently, films comprising nylon 6 and conventional 
heat stabilizers are known to the art and are readily 
commercially available, but in many cases such films do 
not provide sufficient resistance to degradation under  
 
various conditions. Accordingly there remains a 
continuing need in the art for improved films and 
improved film forming compositions which overcome the 
limitations of the prior art. It it to these objects, 
as well as others, that the present invention is 
addressed.  
 EP-A-0170385 discloses a polyamide composition suitable for constituting the 
outer abuse-resistant layer of a heat-sealable laminated packaging film. The 
composition is adapted to withstand the processing and heat-sealing 
temperatures. It comprises either a blend of: 
(a) 40% to 75% by weight nylon 6; and (b) 60% to 25% by weight of a nylon copolymer which consists of 
80% to 90% moieties of a first, nylon 6 polymer and 20% to 
10% moieties of a second nylon polymer  
the overall composition of the blend comprising 2.5% to 10% moieties of the 
said second nylon polymer, or is a copolymer of nylon 6 and another nylon 
polymer, the latter being present in an amount of 2.5 to 20%. The present invention provides a heat stable film comprising the constituents: 
(A) polyepsiloncaprolactam (nylon 6) having a number average 
molecular weight as measured in formic acid 
in the range of 15,000 to 40,000, (B)
