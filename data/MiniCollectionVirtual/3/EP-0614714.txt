<ABSTRACT>
In a CSP continuous casting machine for the continuous production of thin steel slabs, having a funnel-shaped CSP casting dye which is designed for stress-free solidification of the casting strand and whose output opening is assigned a pair of squeezing rollers, the squeezing rollers having bearings which can be moved in a horizontal plane by means of hydraulic adjustment devices, and squeezing together the solidified shells of the casting strand, a substantial improvement, simplification and increased resistance to faults is achieved in that the bearings (14) and (15) of the squeezing rollers (10) and (11) are arranged on cross members (25) and (26) of two frame components (20) and (21) which are constructed with lateral legs (23) and (24) in a U shape and whose legs (23) and (24) are suspended on both sides of the casting dye (1) in pendulum bearings (40 and 41, 42), the hydraulic adjustment devices (30) and (31) each being arranged between the cross members (25) and (26) and being connected thereto in an articulated fashion.
