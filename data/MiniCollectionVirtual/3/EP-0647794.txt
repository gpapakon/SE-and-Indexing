<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an energy-absorbing 
structure, having an energy-absorbing inverter tube (4) 

which is anchored at a first end (8), and the second end 
(6) of which is connected to a structural element (34) on 

which a force acting in the longitudinal direction of the 
tube can be exerted, the inverter tube being coupled to a 

guide element (16) for guiding the inverter tube in the 
lengthwise direction of the tube. Said guide element is 

preferably formed by a guide tube (16) fitted inside the 
inverter tube (4), the first end of which guide tube is 

guided so that it slides in a tube guide (20) situated 
behind the first end of the inverter tube, as seen in the 

direction of movement thereof, while the second end is 
connected to the loadable structural element (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an energy-absorbing structure 
as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and known in 
itself from DE-3 711 692 A1. In this known energy-absorbing structure the energy 
absorbing inverter tube - which is, as such, also known in 
itself - surrounds the body of a rigid cylinder which 
accommodates a piston, slidable in this cylinder against 
the force of a spring element. The piston is connected at 
its front end to the structural element which can be 
subjected to a force of which the energy must be absorbed. This known structure has the drawback that the cylindrical 
element must be fixed to the front end of the 
inverter tube in such a way that during the backwards 
movement of the cylindrical element, which takes place 
when a force is exerted on it, the front end of the 
inverter tube is also pulled backwards. This complicates 
the structure because the cylindrical element must at its 
front end be provided with a collar which has to be welded 
to the front end of the inverter tube. The invention aims to obviate this drawback and 
according to the invention this is obtained in that the 
second end of the inverter tube is connected non elastically 
to the structural element on which loads can be 
exerted while the guide element is a simple guide tube. Thus according to the invention the structural element 
which is subjected to the loading is connected directly 
to the front end of the inverter tube and pushes 
this front end backwards, taking the guide tube with it. 
Not only is the structure simpler and cheaper but replacing 
damage parts is also easier and thus faster. A preferred embodiment is described in claim 2. This 
embodiment has the advantage that an even more uniform 
energy-absorption is obtained; when the loadable structure 
element is subjected to a relatively weak loading the 
connecting element will be the first to deform by the  
 
folding over of the pliably deformable wall thereof, which 
wall is then subjected to tensile stresses when it has 
been fully folded over and thereafter transmits the force, 
acting upon it, to the inverter tube. Preferably one will then also use a short, force-introduction 
tube part disposed on the second end inside 
the inverter tube, and projecting into the deformable 
connecting element. The energy-absorbing structure according to the 
invention will preferably be used between the bumper of a 
car and the rest of the body of the car. In this case there 
will often be a situation in which the position of the 
inverter tube is
