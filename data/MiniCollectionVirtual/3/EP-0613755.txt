<ABSTRACT>
A machine tool comprises a work table (16) rotatable about a vertical axis (18). A first splash-guard wall (22) is fastened to the work table (16) essentially along a diameter of the latter. It subdivides the work table (16) into an equipping side (26) and a machining side (28). A second splash-guard wall (40) is arranged in a spatially fixed manner and above the first splash-guard wall (22) and runs essentially parallel to the latter. Articulated connecting means (40, 42, 44) connect the first and the second splash-guard wall (22, 40) to one another. They overlap a top edge (52') of the first splash-guard wall (22). The first splash-guard wall (22) is rigidly connected to the work table (16). The connecting means (40, 42, 44) include a third splash-guard wall (44) which is connected hinge-like at its top to the second splash-guard wall (40) and is provided at its underside with a channel (48) which encloses the top edge (52') over a finite length.

A machine tool comprising a workpiece table (16) rotatable 
about a vertical axis (18) and being divided into a 

placement side (26) and a machining side (28) by means 
of a first spray shielding panel (22) mounted substantially 

along a diameter of said workpiece table (16), a stationary 
second spray shielding panel (40) arranged above said first 

spray shielding panel (22) and running substantially 
parallel to said first spray shielding panel (22), and 

articulated connection means (42, 44) arranged between 
said first and second spray shielding panels (22, 40) and 

acting upon an upper edge (52') of said first spray 
shielding panel (22), wherein said first spray shielding 

panel (22) is rigidly attached to said workpiece table 
(16) and said connection means (42, 44) comprise a third 

spray shielding panel (44) connected at its top portion 
in a hinged manner (42) to said second spray shielding 

panel (40), characterized in that said third spray shielding 
panel (44) rests at its bottom portion loosely at said 

upper edge (52), whereby said hinged connection (42) between 
said top portion of said third spray shielding panel (44) 

and said second spray shielding panel (40) is laterally 
offset to said placement side (26) as compared to said 

first spray shielding panel (22). 
The machine tool of claim 1, characterized in that the 
bottom portion of the third spray shielding panel (44) 

is provided with a channel (48) that encloses the upper 
edge (52') over a finite length.  

 
The machine tool of claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in 
that said upper edge consists of a strip (50) of a low-friction 

material. 
The machine tool according to one or more of claims 1 
through 3, characterized in that said third spray shielding 

panel (44) is inclined. 
The machine tool according to any of claims 1 through 4, 
characterized in that said third spray shielding panel 

(44) is constructed as a one-piece panel part.
