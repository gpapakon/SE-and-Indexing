<ABSTRACT>
A disc cylinder lock - key - combination, comprises a 
cylinder housing (1) and inside thereof, a turnable inner 

cylinder (2) enclosing a stack of discs including a number of 
locking discs (3, 4). The locking discs (3, 4) are turnable 

by means of the key (12) of the lock into a releasing position 
of the lock mechanism. The key opening (6, 7) of the locking 

discs (3, 4) is so formed that it comprises at least one 
internal protrusion (21) narrowing a part of the key opening 

(6, 7). The adjacent sides of the protrusion (21) can be 
substantially perpendicular with respect to each other. One 

side of the protrusion (21) forms a combination surface (22) 
arranged to cooperate with a corresponding combination surface 

(27) in the key (12) for determining the turning movement of 
a locking disc (3, 4) to open the lock and the other side of 

the protrusion (21) forms a return surface (23) for the 
locking disc (3, 4) on which the key (12) acts by means of a 

guiding element (14) when returning a locking disc (3, 4) into 
its locked position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cylinder lock - key -
combination in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 or
claim 11 and to a key or a key blank provided therefor.A cylinder lock of a kind provided with turnable locking
discs has been known as such for a long time. Even though the
number of different opening combinations available in this
lock type is enormous, there has been a need to create further
different opening variations so as to avoid coincidences, i.e.
a key opens by chance a lock it is not supposed to, which is
very rare as such, but especially to be able to provide lock
groups for separate clients including a large number of locks
and keys possibly arranged hierarchically as mastered locking
systems.One solution is to increase the number of the locking
discs in the lock. However, unless the discs are made
unacceptably thin a consequence of this solution is that the
lock needs more space in the axial direction thereof to
accommodate it and, thus, in practice, the lock is no longer
applicable for insetting in doors or objects to be locked
which are of conventional thickness. Therefore, a more
advantageous alternative solution is to provide a range of
different new key profiles, which are at least partly, and
preferably entirely, mutually incompatible. A prior art
solution of providing new key profiles is disclosed in the
patent publication FI-A-68290 (corresponding to US-A-4127996).
Conventionally this prior art lock type has been operated by
a key, the basic profile of which is semicircular in the
cross-sectional plane of the key shaft. Therefore, due to
manufacturing techniques, the possibilities to provide new
mutually incompatible profile variations are in practice,
however, rather limited. As key shafts having basically a
semicircular profile have been in general use for many years,
the key security relating thereto or to key profiles derived
therefrom continually gets more risky, because by cutting 
additional grooves in the key profiles of keys already in use,
they can be made compatible or operable also with locks
intended only for the new key profiles.A further known key shaft profile utilized in the lock
type in question has a somewhat rectangular cross-section,
This version, however, relates to a specific bidirectionally
operable cylinder lock provided with turnable locking discs,
cf. for instance FI-A-74320 (corresponding to US-A-4351172 and forming the basis of the preamble of claim 9).
In this known arrangement, returning of the locking discs
takes place by means of one or more
