<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for 
preparing a platinum-organosiloxane complex which comprises 

(I) reacting (a) a platinous halide having an average 
crystal size of less than 250 nm (2500 Angstroms) and (b) an 

organosiloxane having from 2 to 4 silicon-bonded organic 
groups having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having terminal 

olefinic unsaturation, the remaining silicon-bonded organic 
substituents being selected from alkyl groups having from 1 

to 6 carbon atoms and phenyl groups, wherein said reaction 
is carried out in the presence of a polar organic liquid 

which is at least a partial solvent for platinous halide, 
and (II) neutralizing the reaction mixture of (I). The 

complexes of the instant invention are useful as catalysts 
for hydrosilylation reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of complexes of platinum and organosiloxanes and
also to the use of said complexes.It is well known in the art that organosilicon
compounds having silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms can be
reacted with organic or organosilicon compounds having
ethylenic unsaturation in the presence of a platinum
compound as catalyst. The use of chloroplatinic acid as
such a catalyst has been disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,823,218.U.S. Patent 3,419,593 describes that the compatibility
of chloroplatinic acid in organosilicon reaction mixtures
can be improved by reacting chloroplatinic acid with an
organosilicon compound, preferably an organosiloxane, having
silicon-bonded unsaturated groups. A method for preparing
platinum complexes of unsaturated siloxanes which are useful
as hydrosilylation catalysts is taught in U.S. Patent
3,775,452. Therein, an unsaturated organosilicon material
is mixed with a platinum halide, typically chloro-platinic
acid or sodium or potassium chloroplatinate and the
resulting mixture is then treated with a base to effect the
removal of inorganic halogen. These prior art methods,
however, require the presence of water, a large excess of
vinylsiloxane or very long reaction times. The use of a
large excess of vinylsiloxane represents a significant
drawback to these methods inasmuch as some loss of this
relatively expensive reactant occurs as a result of cleavage
of the vinyl groups and any remaining excess has to be
recovered from the reaction mixture.Further, it has been discovered that the presence
of water contributes to the loss of vinyl groups from the
siloxane reactant and increases the need for an excess of 
the vinylsiloxane. It was suggested in U.S. Patent
3,775,452 (Col. 7, line 40) that the complex can be
recovered in admixture with the excess vinylsiloxane and
employed as such. However, the presence of the
vinylsiloxane can reduce the activity of the platinum as a
catalyst. Also, such an impure form of the complex may not
be satisfactory for certain applications.We have found that by employing specific platinum
compounds, namely platinous halides, complexes of platinum
and organosiloxanes can be obtained by a method which does
not require the presence of large excesses of organosiloxane
or of water.It was also suggested in U.S. Patent 3,474,123
that complexes of platinous chloride and unsaturated
organosiloxanes could be prepared by direct reaction, as in
the case of organic complexes of platinum. However, the
yields obtained therein are
