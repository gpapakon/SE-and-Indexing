<ABSTRACT>
Nozzles (190 to 197) for jetting ink droplets are so disposed along two line segments (L1 and L2) diverging 
in opposite directions with respect to a main scanning direction. The drop of printing quality and interference in an 

ink chamber can be solved if the two line segments form a V-shape. Accordingly, the present invention provides an 
ink jet type recording head capable of high density printing with high printing quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet type
recording head of an on-demand type for jetting ink droplets
in response to a printing signal to form an ink image on a
recording medium such as recording paper. More specifically,
the present invention concerns an array of nozzles and a shape
of an ink chamber for jetting a droplet of ink.Recently, there has been needs for ink jet type recording
apparatuses capable of outputting an image recorded in high
density. JP-A-60-147348 discloses such an ink jet type
recording head capable of realizing higher recording density
than the linear array density of the nozzles. In the ink jet
type recording head described in this publication, the
recording head having the linearly arranged nozzles along a
single straight line is obliquely disposed with respect to the
main scanning direction to increase the recording density.
However, the structure of this recording head owns such
problems that pitch fluctuation occurs in recording pixels,
which is caused by dimensional errors or the like such as 
dimensional errors occurred when the recording head is mounted
on the carriage. Accordingly, printing qualities are greatly
influenced.To the contrary, in accordance with the ink jet type
recording head described in JP-A-4-312859, as shown in Fig.
12, the nozzles are arranged on a plurality of slanted
straight lines in a zigzag form, and therefore, the printing
quality could be improved irrelevant to accuracy in the
mounting dimension.To realize high density recording by the ink jet type
recording head described in JP-A-4-312859, the pitches between
the respective nozzles must be narrowed, namely the angle a
should be made small. However, this angle setting is
essentially restricted in order to prevent an occurrence of
crosstalk or the like, which is caused by interference among
the ink chambers at the bending portions of the slanted
straight lines. Also, since this recording head is so
constructed as to have a plurality of bending portions,
permeance depths in ink are different from each other between
the recorded image at the bending portion and the recorded
image at the peripheral portion. Then, as illustrated in Fig.
13, a plurality of fluctuation will be produced in the entire
recorded image. Further, prior art document EP-A-0430064 refers to an ink jet
printer, a thermal transfer printer and discloses mainly a dot
matrix printer including at least two print documents aligned
in the print direction. This printer includes a print control
means for receiving print data to
