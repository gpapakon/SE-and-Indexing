<ABSTRACT>
A machine for blow moulding hollow objects from thermoplastic blanks (6, 6'), comprising at least one blank heating apparatus (I) and an array (III) of fixed moulding stations (1a, 1f) positioned along an arc of a circle. The machine is particularly remarkable in that the moulding stations each comprise a finished product ejecting device, while a rotary transfer device (II) is provided between said heating apparatus (I) and said moulding stations (1a, 1f) for transferring heated blanks. The transfer device (II) between the heating apparatus (I) and the moulding stations (III) is suitably a wheel coaxial with the arc of the circle on which the moulding stations (III) are located, said wheel being provided with blank carriers (11') evenly spaced in a circle and designed to pick up a heated blank and place it in a receptacle (23) in a moulding station (1a, 1f).

Machine for blow-moulding hollow objects from 
thermoplastic preforms (6, 6') and comprising at least one 

heating apparatus (I) for the preforms, and an array (III) of 
moulding stations (1a, 1f) disposed fixed in an arc of a 

circle, characterised in that the moulding stations each 
comprise a means for ejection of the finished products, while 

a rotary transfer device (II) is provided between said heating 
apparatus (I) and said moulding stations (1a, 1f) for the 

transfer of the heated preforms, the transfer device (II) 
taking the form of a wheel disposed coaxially with the arc of 

the circle on which the moulding stations (III) are disposed, 
and which is provided with preform carrying means (11') 

distributed evenly along a circle in order to each pick up a 
heated preform and place it in a receptacle (23) of a moulding 

station (1a - 1f). 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
preform carrying means (11') are arranged at the ends of arms 

(11) disposed radially. 
Machine according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the transfer device (II) comprises a number of preform 

carrying means (11') equal to a multiple of the number of 
moulding stations (1a - 1f). 
Machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the transfer device (II) is arranged to pick up each 

preform (6, 6') one by one from the heating apparatus (I), 
while it transfers all of them at once to the receptacles (23) 

of the moulding stations (III) at the moment at which each 
moulding station (1a - 1f) is located in front of a preform 

carrying means (11') of the transfer device loaded with a 
preform, the moulding and ejection operations being effected 

during the rotation and positioning of a new array of preform 
carrying means of the transfer device loaded with preforms. 
Machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the continuous and synchronised operations of the 

moulding stations are produced at least in part by cams (15)  
 

driven in the reverse direction of rotation in relation to the 
direction of rotation of the transfer device (II) such that 

the preforms are processed in decreasing order in relation to 
the length of the path covered between the heating apparatus 

(I) and the corresponding moulding station (1a - 1f) to ensure 
substantially equal stabilisation and heat treatment times for 

each preform. 
Machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that each moulding station (1a - 1f) comprises a plurality 

of impressions for a plurality of preforms, the rotary 
transfer device (II) being designed to effect the transfer of 

the preforms to all the moulding stations (1a - 1f) equipped 
to that end with receptacles (23) in a number equal to the 

number of impressions in the moulding stations, by rotation of 
said transfer device (II). 
Machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, whose heating 
apparatus (I) for the preforms is of the rotary passage type 

in the form of a wheel on which the preforms to be heated and 
distributed are disposed, characterised in that said heating 

apparatus in the form of a wheel is positioned such that the 
preforms describe a circle substantially tangential to that 

described by the preform carrying means (11') of the transfer 
device (II) and turn in the opposite direction to the latter.
