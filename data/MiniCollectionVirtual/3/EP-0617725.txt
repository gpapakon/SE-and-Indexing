<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for inhibiting
fouling of a substrate in an aquatic environment.Man-made structures such as boat hulls, buoys,
drilling platforms, oil production rigs and pipes which
are immersed in water are prone to fouling by aquatic
organisms such as green and brown algae, barnacles,
mussels and the like. Such structures are commonly of
metal, but may also comprise other structural materials
such as concrete. This fouling is a nuisance on boat
hulls, because it increases the frictional resistance
towards movement through the water, with the consequence
of reduced speeds and increased fuel costs. It is a
nuisance on static structures such as the legs of
drilling platforms and oil production rigs, firstly
because the resistance of thick layers of fouling to
waves and currents can cause unpredictable and potentially
dangerous stresses in the structure, and, secondly,
because fouling makes it difficult to inspect the
structure for defects such as stress cracking and
corrosion. It is a nuisance in pipes such as cooling
water intakes and outlets, because the effective cross-sectional
area is reduced by fouling, with the consequence
of reduced flow rates.The commercially most successful methods of
inhibiting fouling have involved the use of anti-fouling
coatings containing substances toxic to aquatic life, for
example tributyltin chloride or cuprous oxide. Such
coatings, however, are being regarded with increasing 
disfavour because of the damaging effects such toxins
can have if released into the aquatic environment. There
is accordingly a need for non-fouling coatings which do
not contain markedly toxic materials.It has been known for many years, for example, as
disclosed in GB 1 307 001 and US 3 702 778 that silicone
rubber coatings resist fouling by aquatic organisms. It
is believed that such coatings present a surface to which
the organisms cannot easily adhere, and they can accordingly
be called non-fouling rather than anti-fouling
coatings. Silicone rubbers and silicone compounds
generally have very low toxic properties. Silicone
rubber coatings have, however, gained little commercial
acceptance. It is difficult to make them adhere well to
the substrate surface that is to be protected, and they
are mechanically rather weak and liable to damage.EP 0 032 597 discloses that silicone polymers onto
which organic polymeric segments are grafted may be
vulcanised to form non-fouling coatings. The vulcanisation
procedure may utilise a crosslinking agent such as
tetraethyl orthosilicate
