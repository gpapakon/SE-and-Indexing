In all their possible stereoisomeric forms as well as
their mixtures, the compounds of formula (I):



in which:

X and Y represent a hydrogen atom or together form a
radical:



characterized in that

R represents a radical:

in which m represents an integer comprised between 0 and 20,
n represents the number 0, 1, 2, or 3,
and either A and B being identical or different represent a
hydrogen atom or a halogen atom or an alkyl or aryl radical

containing up to 8 carbon atoms, the geometry of the double
bond being E or Z or an E + Z mixture,
or A and B form a third bond between the carbon atoms to
which they are linked,

-alkynyl, containing up to 12 carbon atoms
optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms,

carbocyclic or heterocyclic aryl, O-aryl, S-aryl radicals
containing up to 14 carbon atoms, the following radicals:



R'
1
 and R'
2
 being identical or different and representing a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical containing up to 12 carbon

atoms, the aryl radicals themselves being optionally
substituted by one of the substituents indicated above as

substituents of the aryl radicals,
or X
A
 represents a radical:

-O-C(C
6

5
)
3

in which the phenyl radical(s) are optionally substituted by
one or more of the substituents indicated previously,
or X
A
 represents a radical:


in which R
1
 and R
2
 identical or different represent a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical containing up to 12 carbon

atoms, as well as their addition salts with acids.
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 1 in
which n represents the number 0 or 1.
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 2 in
which m represents an integer comprised between 2 and 6, as

well as their addition salts with acids. 
The compounds of formula (I) as defined in claim 3 in
which X
A
 represents a phenyl radical, optionally substituted
by one or more radicals chosen from the group constituted by

halogen atoms, methyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, methoxy,
phenyl and phenoxy radicals optionally substituted by one or

more halogen atoms, as well as their addition salts with
acids.

2
)
4
-Ar or CH
2
-CH=CH-Ar
radical, Ar representing an optionally substituted phenyl

radical, as well as their addition salts with acids.

X
A
 represents a dodecylamino radical.
As medicaments, the compounds of formula (I) defined in
any one of claims 1 to 6, as well as their addition salts

with pharmaceutically acceptable acids.
The pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one
medicament defied in claim 7 as active ingredient.
Preparation process for the compounds of formula (I) as
defined in claim 1, characterized in that a compound of

formula (II):


in all its possible stereoisomeric forms as well as its
mixtures, in which X, Y and Z keep their previous meaning,

is subjected to the action of a compound of formula (III): 

RCHO

in which R keeps the same meaning as in claim 1, in order to
obtain the corresponding compound of formula (I) which is

subjected, if desired, to the action of an esterification
aqent of the hydroxyl function in position 2 or to the

action of an acid in order to form the salt.
