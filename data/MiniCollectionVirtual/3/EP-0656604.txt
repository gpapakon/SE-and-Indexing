<ABSTRACT>
A distance measuring device is capable, even 
utilizing the Lamb wave with velocity fluctuating from 

device to device, of easily setting an approximate wave 
velocity and of effecting precise distance calculation 

even with such approximate wave velocity. There is 
employed a system of measuring the thickness d of the 

wave transmitting plate, then determining the group 
velocity Vg of the Lamb wave from the measured 

thickness, then determining the phase velocity Vp of 
the Lamb wave from the plate thickness d and the 

frequency f of the Lamb wave, and deriving the distance 
from Vg, Vp and the arrival delay time of the Lamb 

wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distance
measuring device, and more particularly to a device for
detecting a Lamb wave entered from a vibration source
by a sensor provided on a vibration transmitting plate,
and calculating the distance from the vibration source
to the sensor, based on the transmission time of the
vibration entered to the vibration transmitting plate.There is already known a method of calculating
the distance between two points utilizing ultrasonic
wave, and, as a specific application of such method,
there is also known a coordinate input apparatus as
disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 4,931,965. Such
apparatus is composed of a vibration transmitting plate
capable of transmitting the vibration and constituting
a coordinate input plane, a coordinate input pen capable
of generating vibration and constituting a coordinate
input instrument, plural sensors mounted on the
vibration transmitting plate for detecting the
vibration, and a circuit for signal processing and
coordinate calculation.The apparatus is used for outputting the 
coordinate of the position designated by the coordinate
input pen, to an information processing apparatus such
as a personal computer.The algorithm for calculating the distance in
the apparatus is constructed such that the distances
from the vibration source to the sensors are at first
determined on the basis of the arrival delay time of
the vibration wave and the velocity thereof, and then
the coordinate position is calculated in geometrical
manner. The above-mentioned conventional apparatus
utilizes a Lamb wave as the wave transmitting in the
vibration transmitting plate, and the distance L
between the vibration source and the sensor is
determined by the following equation:
L = Vp·Tp + N·λp
wherein:
Vp :phase velocityTp :phase delay timeλp :wavelength
and an integer N is determined by:
N = INT{(Vg·Tg - Vp·Tp)/λp + 0.5}
wherein:
Vg :group velocity timeTg :group delay time
which will be explained in detail in the embodiment
later.The precision of distance measurement depends
on the accuracy of detection of the phase delay time
Tp and the group delay time Tg, but it also depends on 
the preciseness of the constants employed in the
calculation, i.e. group velocity Vg, phase velocity Vp
and wavelength λp.The velocity of Lamb wave is known to be
generally dependent on the plate thickness d and the
frequency f of the Lamb wave. In the mass production
of the distance measuring device utilizing the Lamb
wave, certain fluctuation is inevitable in the components
constituting
