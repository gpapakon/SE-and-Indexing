<ABSTRACT>
A wire-mesh cutter (10) has a right and a left-hand grip rod (14, 12) interconnected at a pivot (24) and having an extension (32, 34) projecting beyond the pivot (24). A right and a left-hand jaw section (34, 36) which are interconnected so as to pivot to and fro, are pivotably connected to one of the extensions (26, 28). In addition, the two grips (14, 12) have a region (22) bent in a Z shape. This wire-mesh cutter is characterized in that there are pivoting links (30, 32) between the left-hand grip (12) and the right-hand jaw (34) and between the right-hand grip (14) and the left-hand jaw (36) and with both jaws (34, 36) open, the two extensions (26, 28) are spread apart in the region of their pivoting connection (30, 32) to the two grips (12, 14).
