<ABSTRACT>
An extruded, preferably ceramic facade panel, construction panel or decorative panel (3) has holes running in the direction of extrusion. In order to propose such a panel which is of relatively low weight, permits satisfactory and stepless dimensional adaptation transversely to the hole direction without even a single cut into one of the holes or one of the grooves having to take place, and which, moreover, ensures good channeling of water and can be produced simply and cost-effectively, the border webs (5) arranged between the border surfaces (7), running parallel to the holes (6, 8), and the border-side holes (8) are of at least double the width of the central webs (4).

<CLAIMS>
Extruded, preferably ceramic, façade, structural or
decorative panel with a front panel part (1) and a

rear panel part (2), which are connected by central
webs (4, 12) and edge webs (5, 11, 29, 34),

holes (6, 8, 10, 27, 28, 33) which run in the
direction of extrusion being arranged between the

webs (4, 12; 5, 11, 29, 34), the edge webs (5, 11,
29, 34) being arranged between edge faces (7)

running parallel to the holes (6, 8, 10, 27, 28,
33) and holes (8, 27) at the edges, the edge webs

(5, 11, 29, 34) having at least twice the width of
the central webs (4, 12),
characterized in that

the holes are arranged next to one another for
dimensional adaptation of the panel, taking place

transversely in relation to the direction of the
holes - by a cut extending without impinging on the

holes - and

it being provided:

a) that the edge webs (5, 11, 29, 34) have at least
half the width of the holes (6, 8, 10, 28),

and/or 
b) that the width of the holes increases from the
edge of the panel (30) to the centre of the

panel (31) and the width of each hole is
respectively less than or equal to the overall

dimension from the edge face of the panel to the
respective hole.
Façade panel according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the width of one or both holes (27) at the
edge(s) is less than or equal to half the width of

the adjacently arranged holes (28) and less than or
equal to the width of the edge web (29).
Façade panel according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the width of all or almost
all the holes (33) is less than or equal to the

width of one or both edge webs (34).
Façade panel according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the upper and/or lower edge
faces (37, 39), extending transversely in relation

to the holes (45), are provided with a rear and/or
front rebate (38, 40).
Façade panel according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the webs (50) arranged between the front and
rear panel parts (48, 49) are retained in full

height and partial height at the front and/or rear
rebate (51, 52).
Façade panel according to Claim 4 or 5,

characterized in that
 the sum of the heights (53,
54) of the remaining webs retained on the front

and/or rear rebates (51, 52) is somewhat less than
the original overall height (55) of the webs (50).
Façade panel according to one of Claims 4 to 6,

characterized in that
 the webs (58, 60) retained on 
the front and/or rear rebates (59, 61) are

obliquely formed.
