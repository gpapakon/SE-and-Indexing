<ABSTRACT>
An isolator assembly (5) for use in minimizing mechanical thermal and/or vibrationary strains between two structures (35, 36) is disclosed. The isolator assembly generally includes two spaced base members (10, 15) which are interconnected by a plurality of equally spaced rods (20). The length, diameter and material of the rods (20) are determined based on the particular environment within which the isolator assembly (5) is utilized. The invention has particular application in supporting a hot air blower tube (80) within a cowling (68) of a jet engine unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a strain isolator
assembly and, more particularly, to an isolator assembly
for minimizing mechanical thermal and vibrationary
strains between two interconnected structures in a jet engine.There exist many situations wherein two structures
must be secured together in a high thermal and/or
vibration environment. In some situations, it may be
necessary or desirable to minimize thermal and
vibrationary transfers between the two structures. In
these situations, a strain isolating mounting
arrangement may be required. Under these conditions,
such mounting arrangements will often be subject to
stresses which can lead to fatigue failure.An example of an environment wherein a mounting
arrangement is subject to extreme heat and vibration
factors is in jet engines. For instance, it is common
in the art of jet engines to mount a hot air blower tube
within a cowling surrounding the air intake passage of
the engine for de-icing purposes or to maintain a
substantially laminar intake air flow. Such tubes are
generally mounted to an end wall of the jet engine
casing, within the cowling, by means of a bracket. It
is not uncommon for such tubes to reach temperatures of
about 320°C (about 600°F) and to be subject to varying
degrees of vibration during operation of the jet engine.
These factors combine to cause these mounting
arrangements to be prone to fatigue failures of the
support bracket structure which can create a dangerous 
condition if not readily detected.Therefore, there exists a need in the art for an
isolation mounting arrangement that will resist fatigue
failure even in high thermal and vibration environments
in a jet engine.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide an isolation mounting arrangement that can be
effectively used to interconnect two structures in a jet engine in high
thermal and vibration environments without being subject
to premature fatigue failure.It is also an object of the present invention to
provide an isolation mounting arrangement that will
minimize heat transfer between the two structures.These and other objects of the invention are
achieved by providing an isolator assembly for use in
securing two structures together and which functions to
minimize the transfer of thermal and vibrationary
strains acting on one of the structures from the one
structure to the other.According to the present invention, the isolation
assembly comprises first and second spaced base members,
said first base member adapted to be fixedly secured to
a
