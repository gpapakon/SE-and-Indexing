<ABSTRACT>
To provide an immortalized capillary pericyte line which maintains the
original function/property of the cell line-deriving tissue, its establishment

method, and the screening method for useful substance using the
immortalized capillary pericyte line. Cerebral tissue of a transgenic rat

carrying the large T antigen gene of SV40 thermo-sensitive mutant line
tsA58 is homogenized and the resultant brain capillaries are treated with

protease, thus obtained brain capillary cells are subcultured to establish an
immortalized cell that expresses SV40 thermo-sensitive large T antigen,

PDGF receptor β, and Angiopoietin-1. In addition, the immortalized
vascular pericyte line has ability to deposit calcium on matrix by dense

culture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an immortalized vascular pericyte line,
more particularly to an immortalized vascular pericyte line which can be
established through subculturings of brain capillary cells of a transgenic rat
introduced with the large T antigen gene of SV40 thermo-sensitive mutant
line tsA58, and which expresses PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)
receptor β and Angiopoietin-1.Conventionally, animals have mainly been used in experimental studies
for testing safety or effectiveness of pharmaceuticals. However, in order to
prevent cruelty to animals, techniques using cultured cells etc. instead of
using animals to test and study effectiveness or safety of pharmaceuticals in
vitro are now being studied for practical application. For example, animal
experiments are carried out after preliminarily experimented by methods
using primary cultured cells from living tissues or immortalized cell
(established cell) lines that proliferate infinitely. Primary cells, however,
proliferate well at the early stage, but their proliferation will gradually come
to a halt in the course of repeated subculturings and ends up with death (this
event is called cell aging). Further, primary cells are said to alter their
properties in the course of subculturings, in addition to the risk that their
properties differ each time they are extracted from living tissues. To obtain
primary cells sufficient for use in experiments is said to be extremely
difficult, especially when the proliferation rate is considerably slow or the
cells are micro-organ derived Meanwhile, immortalized cells, that are free from cell aging and have
acquired ability for infinite proliferation in the course of subculturings of the
primary culture, have stable and equal properties. Still, many of such
immortalized cells lose part or whole of morphology or function that the cells
originally possessed in the organisms, and therefore in the experiments
using such immortalized cells, it has been considered difficult to precisely
reflect their original properties that the cells displayed in their deriving
tissues. Hence, an attempt has been made to transform a primary cell by
introducing cancer-causing genes such as ras gene or c-myc gene, E1A gene
from adenovirus, the large T antigen gene from SV40 virus, HPV16 gene
from Human Papiloma Virus, and the like, to successively maintain the high
proliferation ability of the primary cell; and to establish a cell which will not
lose its original property even in the course of subculturings. However, to
obtain
