<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the bending of glass sheets 
to shapes which cannot be achieved by gravity bending 

alone. A method is provided in which a glass sheet is bent 
on a mould (3) having a movable end (6), comprising the 

steps of: subjecting the glass sheet to an initial gravity 
bending step; providing support to a portion of the glass 

sheet located on the movable end (6) of the mould (3); 
while providing said support, lowering said movable end (6) 

away from the glass sheet; subjecting the glass sheet to a 
press bending step. 
Support may be provided by a reduced pressure within 
an upper mould (4'), a mechanical arm (40), or gas directed 

in a generally upwards direction. 
The invention may be used for bending glass for 
architectural or automotive purposes, e.g. for bending a 

pair of glass sheets (1,2), one on top of the other, for 
use in the manufacture of a laminated windscreen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the bending of glass sheets,
and more particularly to a method of bending glass sheets
in which there is an initial gravity bending step and a
subsequent press bending step. Such a method is
especially, but not solely, useful for bending automotive
glass for subsequent laminating. The invention also
relates to an apparatus for use in the method.Glass for the windows of vehicles is normally curved,
the curvature being imparted to planar glass by a bending
process. In one such bending process, planar glass sheets
are placed upon female ring moulds and heated to the glass
softening point. Each sheet bends ("sags") under its own
weight until the periphery of the glass sheet is in contact
with the ring mould. Such a bending technique is known as
"sag" or gravity bending, and it has been developed over
the years so as to bend glass which meets the demands of
vehicle manufacturers.For example, as more deeply bent glass was required,
the ring mould was modified by attaching the ends of the
mould to the central portion by hinges, the hinged mould
ends progressively closing as the glass softened and the 
bend proceeded. This avoided the tendency for the glass
sheet to slide relative to the mould during the bend,
thereby preventing scratching. Such a mould is commonly
termed an articulated mould.The gravity bending process has been found
particularly suitable for the production of glass that is
to be subsequently laminated by combining two sheets of
glass with a sheet of interlayer material. The gravity
bending process is capable of producing glass to a high
optical quality, and it is also possible to bend two sheets
of glass simultaneously, thereby producing a matched pair
of glasses which give an excellent fit on laminating.In recent years, developments in vehicle design have
required glass of complex curvature, i.e. glass that is
bent in two directions generally at right angles to each
other. It is not possible to impart more than a very
limited degree of complex curvature to a sheet of glass by
gravity bending alone.Furthermore, increased use of automated assembly by
vehicle manufacturers demands that tighter dimensional
tolerances be met by the glass. The shape of the periphery
of the bent pane must be accurate, not only in terms of its
two dimensional projection, but also in three dimensions,
i.e. the angle of the glass adjacent the periphery must be
correct. If this "angle of entry", as it is known to those 
skilled in the art, is not correct, the bent pane will not
fit and seal
