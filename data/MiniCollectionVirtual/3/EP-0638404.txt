<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for producing plastic 
products from waste materials by: cutting into pieces a 

thermoplastic material having a loss factor higher than 
0.005 such as to have a high absorbence of radio-frequency 

radiation, mixing the pieces with at least one other 
particulate material (16,18,20), depositing the mixture on a supporting 

surface (2); and applying radio-frequency radiation (22) to the 
mixture sufficient to soften mainly the outer surfaces of 

the pieces of thermoplastic material by dielectric heating (22), 
while applying pressure to the mixture (20) to bond the mixture 

together by sintering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for producing plastic products. The invention is 
particularly useful for recycling waste plastic materials 
and is therefore described below with respect to this 
application. The increase in usage of plastic materials in 
everyday life has created a serious disposal problem since 
most types of plastic materials are not readily degradable. 
Efforts are therefore continually being made to develop 
methods for recycling waste plastic materials not only to 
alleviate the waste-disposal and pollution problems, but 
also to lower the need for virgin plastic and other raw 
materials (e.g., wood) in producing various products and 
thereby to lower the cost of such products. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method of producing plastic products 
comprising: cutting into piece a thermoplastic material 
having a loss factor higher than 0.005 such as to have a 
high absorbence of radio-frequency radiation, the pieces 
being cut so that the bulk of the pieces have a size of 
2-10 mm in their largest dimension; mixing the pieces of 
thermoplastic material with at least one other particulate 
material; depositing the mixture on a supporting surface; 
and applying radio-frequency (RF) radiation to the mixture 
sufficient to soften only the outer surfaces of the pieces 
of thermoplastic material by dielectric heating, while  
 
applying pressure to the mixture to bond the mixture 
together by sintering. The "loss factor" of a material is defined as the 
power factor of the material multiplied by its dielectric 
constant, and determines the amount of heat generated in the 
material in the presence of RF radiation. A particularly 
suitable material is polyvinyl chloride, which has a loss 
factor ranging from 0.0054 to 0.32. Other high-loss factor 
materials that may be used are the acrylic resins which have 
a loss factor ranging from 0.056 to 0.1, and polycarbonates 
which have a loss factor of up to about 0.009. The mixture may also include an organic plastic 
material having a loss factor lower than 0.005, i.e., having 
a low absorbence of radio-frequency radiation. This latter 
material is also cut into pieces such that the bulk thereof 
are from 2 to 10 mm in their largest dimension. Examples of 
such other materials are polyethylene having a loss factor 
of 0.00046 to 0.00072, polystyrene having a loss factor of 
about 0.00025, and polypropylene having a loss factor of 
about 0.00085. Where the low RF radiation absorbent
