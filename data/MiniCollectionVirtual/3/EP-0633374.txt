<ABSTRACT>
A lock cylinder with a cylinder housing (1), with a cylinder plug (2) and with a keyway (3) has a rotatable body, especially a star wheel (7), which engages in the latter and is mounted in the cylinder plug (2) and which has a rotary shaft (10) and is displaceable together with its rotary shaft (10) in the direction of height of the keyway (3). In the blocking position, the rotary shaft (10) projects upwards or downwards beyond the cylinder plug (2) and engages into a housing bore (12, 13). A flat key (5) has a toothing oblique relative to the insertion direction, especially a row of holes along a hole track (8, 8', 8'', 8'''), into which, when the key (5) is inserted into the keyway (3), the rotatable body engages positively in the manner of the kinematics of a pinion along a rack. By means of bevels in the region of the toothing, especially by means of oblique bores (9) of the row of holes (8, 8', 8'', 8'''), or by means of bevels (14) on the engagement surfaces of the rotatably mounted body, especially on the end faces of arms of the star wheel (7), a lifting movement occurs during engagement for the purpose of controlling the height of the rotary shaft (10) acting as a blocking pin. Instead of the oblique arrangement of the row of holes, it is sufficient to offset at least one hole (9') in height in relation to the preceding hole. Furthermore, the hole (9'') can also have a base surface (15) which is oblique, as seen in the insertion direction, and along which the star wheel (7) ascends.

<CLAIMS>
Flat key (5) and lock cylinder with a cylinder core (2) that can be tumed in a
casing (1), with a key duct (3) extending through the cylinder core (2), and

with a body that is mounted for rotation in the cylinder core (2) extending into
the cylinder core (2), which body engages the flat key (5) when it is inserted

into or withdrawn from the key duct (3) in order to transmit a rotating
movement, with the body that is mounted for rotation being firmly connected to

a rotating axis (10) which can be moved in its axial direction as well as
beyond the cylinder core (2), at least on one end, and inserted into a recess

(12, 13) in the casing (1), and with the flat key (5) being provided with
transmission means to convey an axial movement, especially a lifting

movement, to the body that is mounted for rotation and its rotating axis (10),

characterized in that
 the body that is mounted for rotation in the cylinder
core is embodied as gearwheel or tumstile (7), in that, as a means of

transmission, there is provided in the flat key (5) a row of apertures that is
located along an aperture track (8, 8', 8", 8'") which extends at an angle to

the key axis, with the apertures (9) penetrating through the cross-section of
the flat key (5), or that there is provided a row of apertures with a minimum of

two apertures (9') that penetrate the key at different heights, in relation to the
longitudinal axis of the key, or that there is provided a minimum of one

aperture (9"), having an inclined control surface or control edge (15), and in
that, in the area of engagement, an inclined surface is provided on every gear

of a gearwheel or arm of a turnstile (7), either on the side of the aperture or on
the side of gearwheel or tumstile, in order to shift the position of the

gearwheel of the tumstile (7) in the axial direction.
Flat key (5) and lock cylinder with a cylinder core (2) that can be tumed in a
casing (1), with a key duct (3) extending through the cylinder core (2), and

with a body that is mounted for rotation in the cylinder core (2) extending into
the cylinder core (2), which body engages the flat key (5) when it is inserted

into or withdrawn from the key duct (3) in order to transmit a rotating
movement, with the body that is mounted for rotation being firmly connected to

a rotating axis which can be moved in its axial direction as well as beyond the
cylinder core (2), at least on one end, and inserted into a recess (12, 13) in

the casing (1), and with the body that is mounted for rotation being embodied
as gearwheel or turnstile (7), with the flat key (5) being provided with

transmission means to convey an axial movement, especially a lifting
movement, to the gearwheel or turnstile (7) and with the means of

transmission in the flat key being embodied as a row of apertures that is
located along an aperture track (8, 8
', 8", 8"') which extends at an angle to
the key axis, with the apertures (9) penetrating through the cross-section of

the flat key (5), or as a row of apertures with a minimum of two apertures (9')
that penetrate the key at different heights, in relation to the longitudinal axis of

the key, or with a minimum of one aperture (9"), having an inclined control
surface or control edge (15) and, in the area of engagement, with an inclined

surface being provided on every gear of a gearwheel or arm of a turnstile (7),
either on the side of the aperture or on the side of gearwheel or turnstile, in

order to shift the position of the gearwheel of the turnstile (7) in the axial
direction. 
Flat key (5) according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the aperture track (8,
8', 8", 8'") comprises a row of apertures with bores that extend at an angle,

when seen in a cross-sectional view of the key, which row of apertures lifts or
lowers the gearwheel or the tumstile (7) from its base position when the latter

is engaged.
Flat key (5) according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the row of apertures
comprises a minimum of two apertures that penetrate the flat key (5) at

different heights.
Flat key (5) according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 a minimum of one
aperture (9") is provided which penetrates the cross-section between key

shoulder and key bit and has approximately the shape of a rectangular
triangle, the hypothenuse of which acts as a control edge (15) and is therefore

oriented downwards in the direction of the key tip, and the catheti (19, 10) of
which extend parallel to the inserting direction of the key (5) or at a right angle

to it, always between the hypothenuse (15) and the key shoulder (17), so that
one arm (20) of a tumstile (7) moves upwards and lifts the tumstile (7) when

being rotated out of the aperture (9") and being in a slanting position along
the hypothenuse (15).
Flat key and lock cylinder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, on the
side of the gearwheel or turnstile, the inclined surfaces are embodied as

chamfers (14) in the form of part of a conical or pyramidal surface, where the
axis of the conus or pyramid coincides with the rotating axis (10) of the

gearwheel or tumstile (7).
