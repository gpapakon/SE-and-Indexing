<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the use of auxin transport inhibitors as potentiators or
enhancers of herbicides, as well as co-application of such auxin transport inhibitors and
herbicides, compositions containing at least one auxin transport inhibitor in combination
with at least one herbicide and use of these in combatting or controlling undesired plant
growth and in plant growth regulation.Auxin transport inhibitors are compounds which themselves are herbicides and act by
inhibiting transmembrane movement of auxin which accumulates in the cells and affects
plant growth. Examples of auxin transport inhibitors are e.g. naptalam, TIBA (2,3,5-triiodiobenzoic
acid) and DPX 1840 [3,3a-dihydro-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-8H-pyrazolo
[5,1-a]isoindol-8-one] (cf E.M. Beyer, Jr., Plant Physiol., 50, 322 (1972), E.M. Beyer, Jr. et
al., Plant Physiol., 57, 839 (1976)) and semicarbazones such as described in US Patents
5,098,462 and 5,098,466 and EP-A-219451. Especially preferred auxin transport inhibitors
in the practice of the invention are compounds of formula A

wherein,
X and Y represent independently, hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine, andR is the group
wherein Z is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and M is hydrogen, or a salt forming moiety
e.g. an alkali metal cation or an optionally substituted ammonium cation.Compounds of formula A are generally disclosed, e.g. in US Patents 5,098,462 and
5,098,466 and in European Patent Application 219451, as well as processes for their
production, their use as herbicides and plant growth regulators and herbicidal and plant
growth regulating compositions containing them, the contents of each of which in this
respect are incorporated herein by reference. These patents make no reference to the
specific compound group of formula A or its potentiating activity.The term herbicides, as used herein, refers to compounds which combat or control
undesired plant growth. This class of compounds may be divided into sub-classes
according to the primary type or mode of action the herbicide has on the plant. For
example according to G.F. Warren of Purdue University, Indiana, USA, herbicides can be
classified as auxin transport inhibitors, growth regulator herbicides, photosynthesis
inhibitors, pigment inhibitors, growth inhibitors, amino acid synthesis inhibitors, lipid
biosynthesis inhibitors, cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, rapid cell membrane disruptors as
well as "miscellaneous" herbicides which do not come under one of the preceding
categories. (Growth regulator herbicides include, e.g.
