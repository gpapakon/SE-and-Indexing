<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a field-emission element that is fabricated 
by forming an elevated surface and a base surface on a conductive 

substrate or a semiconductor substrate by applying a 
photolithographic process and an etching process, and making 

these surfaces cross at a step with an acute angle between the 
two surfaces. The intersection of the elevated surface with the 

step form a cathode having a radius of curvature of less than 
20 nm. 
A gate electrode formed on the base electrode but insulated 
therefrom is disposed at a distance less than 1 µm from said 

cathode by controlling the distance by the thickness of an 
etching protection mask. The field-emission element enables 

electrons to be emitted from the cathode when a voltage less than 
150 V is applied between the cathode and the gate electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated field-emission 
elements operable at a low voltage and to methods of forming such 
elements. The fabrication of miniaturized field-emission elements 
became possible by the advancements of semiconductor fabrication 
technologies. In particular, Spindt et al. disclosed the 
fabrication of a corn-shaped (vertical) field-emission cathode. 
(C. A. Spindt, J. Appl. Phys, Vol. 47, p. 5248 (1976)). Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 12(a) - FIG. 12(d) depict 
the conventional fabrication method of a field-emission cathode 
disclosed by Spindt et al. The Spindt et al. process is 
explained below. As depicted in FIG. (a), the fabrication process is begun 
with depositions of an insulation layer 101 and a metal layer 102 
utilized as a gate electrode on a semiconductor (silicon) 
substrate 100. A round small hole 103 is then formed in said 
metal layer 102 and insulation layer 101 by using a conventional 
photolithographic process. As depicted in FIG. 12(b), a sacrificing layer 104, made of 
a material such as alumina, is vacuum deposited on the 
semiconductor substrate 100 at a shallow angle thereto and the 
gate electrode. As a result, the diameter of gate hole 103 is 
substantially reduced. Then, as shown in FIG. 12(c), metal layer  
 
105, made of a material such as molybdenum, is vertically 
deposited on semiconductor substrate 100. The gate-hole diameter 
is gradually reduced as the metal layer 105 is vacuum deposited, 
and a cone-shaped emitter (cathode) 106 is formed within gate 
hole 13. The fabrication process is completed by removing the 
sacrificing layer 104 and the unnecessary metal layer 105. The 
field-emission cathode, thus obtained, is operable by applying a 
high-voltage on gate electrode 102. This causes electrons to be 
drawn into a vacuum from emitter 106. The electrons are 
collected by an anode (not shown) disposed at a position opposing 
emitter 106. Following the fabrication process disclosed by Spindt et 
al., a vertical type field-emission cathode of similar 
construction, having a sharper emitter formed by applying either 
an anisotropic etching or a thermal oxidation process on a 
silicon crystal surface was disclosed. (H. F. Gray et al., IEDM 
Tech. Dig. P. 776 (1986), and Betsui, Trans. 1990 Fall. Conv. of 
Elect. Inform. comm. Engineer. Japan, No; 5, SC-8-2 (1990)). In contrast to the fabrication of vertical structure 
cathodes described above, Itoh et al. disclose a field-emission 
cathode of planar construction (Itoh et al., Vacuum.
