<ABSTRACT>
A low formaldehyde, high gel fraction latex 
binder is made utilizing a compound having the formula 


or 

wherein R and R', independently, is an alkyl having from 
1 to 10 carbon atoms, 
and R⁴ is hydrogen, or wherein R³ 
and R⁴, independently is an alkyl, an aromatic, or combinations 

thereof having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or 
wherein said R³ and R⁴ are connected to form an internal 

amide, and wherein the isopropenyl group is either in the 
ortho, meta or para position. The latex binder is generally 

an emulsion or latex copolymer made from various 
monomers including at least one or more conjugated dienes 

having a total of from 4 to 10 carbon atoms with butadiene 
being preferred and from one or more vinyl-substituted 

aromatics having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms, with styrene 
being preferred. The amount of the above formulation compounds 

is generally from about 0.25 to about 20 parts by 
weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the one or more 

conjugated dienes and the vinyl-substituted aromatic monomers. 
The latex binder has good stability, and has many 

applications such as to bind a paper-coating composition 
to a cellulose substrate, or to bind non-woven fibers  

 
together. The latex binder generally contains 10 parts or 

less by weight of formaldehyde per million parts by weight 
and desirably contains nil, that is, no detectable amounts 

of formaldehyde therein, even after extended periods of 
time, e.g., 28 days.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to high gel fraction
polymeric binders and latex compositions thereof e.g. such
as are utilized for paper coating compositions, for
binding non-woven fibres together, and to processes for
making and using the same. More particularly, the
disclosure proposes such high gel fraction polymeric latex
binder compositions wherein formaldehyde generation can be
substantially eliminated.Latex binder compositions have been used in a
wide variety of applications such as adhering paper
coatings to cellulosic substrates, in carpet and rug
backings, and in various non-woven products which have
gained broad acceptance as replacements for woven fabrics,
including such articles as facings or top sheets in diapers,
incontinence pads, sanitary napkins, hospital gowns,
and other single and multiple-use non-woven products.Conventional latex binders have generally been
prepared from acrylic polymers, styrene/acrylate copolymers,
or styrene/butadiene copolymers containing N-methylol
functionality which, upon curing, generate substantial
quantities of formaldehyde, typically from 200 to 500 ppm
or more. It is desirable to use binders which are essentially
free of formaldehyde generation. Formaldehyde-free
latex binders include various urethane polymers, acrylic
polymers, styrene/acrylate copolymers, and the like, such
as those disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,837,462;
4,207,367; 4,381,332; 5,030,507, and others. However, none
of the prior art discloses a suitable conjugated
diene/vinyl-substituted aromatic copolymer latex binder
which is free of formaldehyde formation.Furthermore, coagulation stability and mechanical
stability while imparting excellent wet tensile strength
to cellulosic articles (such as paper) are desirable
properties to achieve in a latex binder generally. We note that EP-A-596 291, with an earlier filing
date but published after the filing date of the present
application, discloses a range of room-temperature
curable binder copolymers which may include oxime-blocked
m- or p-isopropenyl-α,α'-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate for
crosslinking. On removal of solvent this reacts with
ketone or aldehyde-functional monomers included specially
in the composition. Other monomers are typically
acrylate, although styrene and butadiene are listed as
options.In the present invention we provide in a first
aspect a high gel fraction latex binder composition
comprising an aqueous dispersion of a binder polymer
which is the polymerisation reaction product of
(a) 100 parts by weight of a primary
