<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of metal-free phthalocyanines which can carry up to 16 halogen atoms, cyano groups, carboxyl groups, sulpho groups, C1-C18-alkyl groups and/or aryl radicals as substituents by reductive cyclisation of ortho-phthalodinitrile, substituted ortho-phthalodinitriles or mixtures thereof, which comprises effecting the cyclisation in C2-C4-alkylene monoglycols, oligoglycols or polyglycols, their mono-C1-C8-alkyl or -aryl ethers or their mixtures in the presence of an aromatic compound of the general formula I
