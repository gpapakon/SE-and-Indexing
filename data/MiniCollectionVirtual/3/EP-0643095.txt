<ABSTRACT>
A new curable compounded halopolymer that 
exhibits in the cured state good to excellent adhesion 

to polyamides. 
The curable halopolymer achieves better adhesion 
due to a balance of carbon black relative to talc, 

preferable with the cyclohexyl benzothiazole 
sulfenamide or related benzothiazole sulfenamide. 
This invention is highly desirable in making 
specialty hoses and belts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of curing a
halopolymer to give an improved adhesive bond to a
polyamide and to the resulting laminate. More
particularly, this invention relates to the production of a
shaped laminated body having a halopolymer adhered to a
polyamide layer to give the shaped laminate improved
properties in adhesion and resistance to chemicals.
Specifically, this invention relates to the manufacture of
improved articles such as belts and hoses and to said
articles per se having an adhesive bond exhibiting an
adhesion of at least 4,1 N cm-2 (6 pounds per square inch)
between the cured halopolymer and the polyamide and
preferably 4,8 N cm-2 (7 psi) or more.Hoses for refrigeration and air conditioning systems,
such an automobile air conditioners present problems in
requiring flexible tubing or hoses of high strength capable
of withstanding relatively high temperatures. With the
fluorocarbon refrigerants, difficulty is experienced with
the hose material loosing the fluorocarbons and cracking.
Consequently, laminates of different rubbers have come into
wide use but problems are still experienced with the
laminate delaminating due to poor adhesion between the
laminate members and cracking of the rubbers due to
presence of certain metal salts such as those formed
between halogen of the halopolymer and the alkali and
alkaline earth oxides of the curing recipes. Also,
heretofore, it has been necessary to use a tie gum to get
good adhesion between a halopolymer layer and a core of
polyamide. JP-A- 63 242 539 discloses a hose useful for
transportation of freon gas. The inside tube is formed of a
chlorine containing synthetic rubber comprising e. g.
chlorinated PE, MgO, carbon black, plasticiser, peroxide
and talc.US-A- 5 149 732 discloses a rubber composition for use
in a composite hose for the attachment of the hose to a
metal fitting. The composition comprises a base rubber, an
organic filler, a silane coupling agent and a vulcanizing
agent. A laminated article such as a belt or hose is
provided comprising a core layer of a polyamide having
adhered preferably directly to it a layer of a
halopolymer to give an adhesive bond of 5 and
preferably of 6 or more pounds per square inch. This
adhesive bond is achieved by compounding the
halopolymer with a bis-dienophile crosslinker, alkali
and/or alkaline earth oxide to neutralize the halogen
acids formed, a peroxide or sulfur curative in amounts
customarily used together with about 25 to about 70
and preferably about 35 to about 55 parts of carbon
black
