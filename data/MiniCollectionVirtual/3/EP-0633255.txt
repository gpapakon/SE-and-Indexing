<ABSTRACT>
In reacting tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in solution in 
tertiary butyl alcohol with propylene to produce propylene 

oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol in a reactor system 
comprising a first isothermal segment and a second adiabatic 

segment about 60 to 80 weight percent of the tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide is converted in the isothermal segment to 

provide an intermediate reaction mixture, a recycle stream 
comprising about 25 to 100 weight percent of the combined 

weight of the propylene and the tertiary butyl alcohol 
solution is removed from the intermediate reaction mixture 

and recycled to the first isothermal segment and the 
remainder of the intermediate reaction mixture is passed 

through the adiabatic segment where an additional 20 to 40 
weight percent of the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide is 

converted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the epoxidation of propylene.
More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the
reaction of propylene with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in
solution in tertiary butyl alcohol in the presence of a
peroxidation catalyst to provide propylene oxide and additional
tertiary butyl alcohol.Still more particularly, this invention relates to a
process for preparing propylene oxide and tertiary butyl
alcohol by reacting tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in solution
in tertiary butyl alcohol with propylene in the presence of a
soluble molybdenum catalyst, wherein the reaction is conducted
in stages involving a reactor system comprising a first
isothermal segment and a second adiabatic segment, wherein a
feed mixture comprising a recycle stream, propylene, and a
tertiary butyl alcohol solution of tertiary butyl hydroperand
a molybdenum catalyst are charged to the isothermal
segment under reaction conditions sufficient to provide for a
conversion of 60 to 80 wt.% of the tertiary butyl
hydroperoxide to thereby provide an intermediate reaction
mixture, wherein a recycle stream constituting 25 to
100 wt.% of the combined weight of the propylene and 
tertiary butyl alcohol solution is removed as the recycle
stream and wherein the remainder of the intermediate reaction
product is charged to the adiabatic segment for the conversion
of an additional 20 to 40 wt.% of the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide
to reaction products.The reaction of an olefin such as propylene with a
hydroperoxide such as tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in solution
in a solvent such as tertiary butyl alcohol in the presence of
a soluble molybdenum catalyst is disclosed in Kollar U. S.
Patent No. 3,351,635. Kollar teaches that in general, from
about 0.5 to 100 moles of olefin may be used per mole of
hydroperoxide, the preferred molar ratio being within the
range of about 2 to about 10 moles of olefin per mole of
hydroperoxide.Marquis et al. in U. S. Patent No. 4,891,437 disclose an
improvement on the Kollar process in the reaction of propylene
with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide wherein the
reaction is conducted in a medium composed of 60 wt.% or more
of polar components which is formed by utilizing a molar ratio
of propylene to tertiary butyl hydroperoxide of about 0.5 to
2 moles of charged propylene per mole of charged hydroperoxide,
the reaction being conducted in solution in tertiary
butyl alcohol in the presence of a molybdenum catalyst.

of catalysts useful
