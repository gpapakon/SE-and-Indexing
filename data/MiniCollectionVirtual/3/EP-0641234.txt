<DESCRIPTION>
Toy balloons generally have an inflated 
diameter ranging from about 15 cm to about 50 cm. 
These are conventionally filled with helium gas. Such 
lighter than air balloons have been widely sold and 
used for a number of years at places like circuses, 
fairs, toy stores, and the like. Another common use 
for such balloons is for advertising purposes wherein a 
logo or advertising message is printed on the outside 
surface of the balloon. In more recent years there has 
been a proliferation of balloon greeting service 
companies who, for a fee, deliver bunches of helium 
inflated elastomeric balloons, usually conveying a 
personal message, to individuals on birthdays, 
anniversaries, Valentine's Day, or other special 
occasions. Another popular use for this balloon 
delivery service is to send a get well message with up 
to a dozen helium inflated balloons to an adult or 
child who is convalescing from an illness in a hospital 
or other institution.  
 A major problem with such prior art helium 
filled elastomeric balloons is that they do not remain 
buoyant for very long; their typical buoyant lifetime 
ranges from a few hours to a day or so. This short 
buoyant lifetime is due to the diffusion of the very 
small helium atoms through the elastomeric envelope 
provided by the balloon. Because of the short buoyant 
lifetime, such balloons must be inflated at the time of 
sale or just prior to sale. They cannot be inflated in 
advance and stocked for use when needed. Burchett U.S. Patent 4,634,395, the 
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by 
reference, discloses a method of increasing the 
floating life of helium filled elastomeric balloons by 
coating a surface of the balloon with a solution of 
polyvinyl alcohol and a water soluble plasticizer such 
as glycerine which is the best known and most 
frequently used plasticizer for polyvinyl alcohol. 
Burchett also recited a group of other water soluble 
plasticizers which included ethylene glycol, propylene 
glycol, butylene glycol, sorbitol, diglycerol, low 
molecular weight polyethylene glycols, ethanolamine 
salts, sodium or ammonium thiocyanate, ethanol 
acetamide and ethanol formamide. It was found that although the polyvinyl 
alcohol water solution alone would give increased 
floating life, the balloons underwent an undesirable 
change in appearance on aging. Namely, these balloons  
 
developed surface wrinkles within a day or two after 
inflation with helium and the wrinkling became 
progressively worse on aging the inflated balloons.
