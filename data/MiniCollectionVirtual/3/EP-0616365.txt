<ABSTRACT>
A power semiconductor element is disclosed which has integrated protection against being destroyed by static electricity. Such a semiconductor element (1) contains a semiconductor substrate (10) having at least one MOS structure, the gate (7) of which is arranged insulated from the semiconductor substrate (10). Such structures are susceptible to destruction by dielectric breakdown of the insulation layer, caused by electrostatic charging. According to the invention, this insulating layer is now replaced by a semi-insulating layer (9) between the gate electrode (3) and the main electrode (2), so that limited current flow between the gate (7) and the main electrode (2) is possible and no potential difference can any longer build up.
