<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a non-fat or 
low fat edible plastic dispersion which has rheological 

properties similar to solid margarine or squeezable 
margarine. The plastic dispersion includes (a) a fat 

mimetic selected from branched chain amylopectin starch and 
mixtures thereof with at least one member selected from 

gelling type maltodextrins, and starch modified by acid 
hydrolysis to remove amorphous regions therefrom, and (b) 

inulin and/or gum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
non-fat or low fat product that has the appearance of 
margarine and squeezable margarine. In particular, the 
invention relates to a non-fat product that has the 
appearance and taste of margarine and squeezable margarine, 
but has substantially fewer calories and has no fat. In recent years, there has been a substantial 
research effort directed to reducing or eliminating the fat 
in various water continuous food products, such as ice 
cream, pourable water dressings, salad dressing, mayonnaise 
and cheese. To produce these fat reduced products, many fat 
mimetic materials have been developed. U.S. Patent No. 4,734,287 to Singer, et al. 
describes a proteinaceous, water-dispersible macrocolloid 
comprising substantially non-aggregated particles of dairy 
whey protein. U.S. Patent No. 4,911,946 to Singer, et al. 
discloses a fat substitute which comprises water-dispersible 
macrocolloid particles having a substantially 
spheroidal shape and a particle size distribution effective 
to import the substantially smooth organoleptic character of 
an oil-and-water emulsion. The particles are produced by 
subjecting carbohydrate materials such as quinoa starch, 
calcium alginate, cross-linked dextran, gellan gum, konjac, 
mannan, chitin, schizophyllan and chitosan to high shear 
forces by introducing a carbohydrate solution into a highly 
turbulent reaction zone. This treatment produces gelled 
microparticles having the spheroidal shape and size 
described in this patent. U.S. Patent No. 5,104,674 to 
Chen. et al. describes fat mimetic materials which are  
 
produced by subjecting fibers of a polysaccharide gum and 
various protein sources to high shear forces to 
microfragment the particles. While numerous fat mimetic materials have been 
produced, such fat mimetic materials are almost universally 
used in a water continuous product, such as a pourable 
dressing, mayonnaise or salad dressing. Only recently have 
attempts been made to produce a non-fat substitute for fat 
continuous systems, such as butter and margarine. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,956,193 to Cain, et al. describes a non-fat 
edible plastic dispersion which is a substitute for butter 
or margarine. The edible plastic dispersion of the Cain, et 
al. patent includes at least two condensed phases, at least 
one of which is continuous. The dispersion includes two gel 
forming compositions (A) and (B). Gel forming composition A 
contains 1-8 times the critical concentration of a gelling 
agent (a) selected from
