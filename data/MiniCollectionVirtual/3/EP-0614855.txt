<ABSTRACT>
Optical fiber drawn from preforms including sol-gel-derived glass is found to contain 
small refractory particles of the order of a micron in size. These particles initiate 

fiber breaks with the result that fiber may not meet proof-test tensile strength 
requirements. An effective separation method relies upon density and/or size 

difference from suspended sol particles for separation in the ungelled sol. A 
preferred separation procedure is centrifugation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with the fabrication of silica-based optical
fiber drawn from preforms which include sol-gel-produced glass. Early use is
expected to take the form of low-loss single-mode fiber prepared from composite
preforms constituted of sol-gel-produced overcladding tubes enclosing core rods
prepared by usual fiber fabrication processes.EP-A-0-583 943, which falls
within the terms of Article 54(3) EPC,
represents the breakthrough to finally
realize the economy implicit in use of sol-gel prepared silica-based glass bodies. In
one use, tubular bodies, together with cores prepared by soot processing or by
Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition, make up the composite preforms from which
optical fiber may be drawn. That patent application describes incorporation of an
organic polymer in the sol to avoid cracking of the gelled body during drying.
Subsequent polymer removal during firing results in final drawn fiber of quality
commensurate with that produced by more expensive methods now in use.Intensive experimentation supports the initial objective - it has been
demonstrated that resulting fiber is of the same loss characteristics as state-of-the-art
fiber. However, a further problem has been identified. Fiber breakage due to
discrete particles of contaminant reduces yield. These particles, which may be of 1
µm or smaller size - are inherently avoided during MCVD or soot processing.Certain particles carried over from the liquid phase are assimilated in the
glass during following high temperature processing - before or during firing at ≈
2200°C. Al2O3 is an example of such a harmless contaminant, which, since not
retained as a discrete particle, does not initiate breakage. Particles which survive
high temperature processing, and are of concern, are referred to as "refractory".It is the object of the invention to remove such particles - notably of ZrO2 and TiO2.According to the present invention there is provided a process as defined
in claim 1.Specific procedures depend on mechanical separation before gelation.
Mechanical separation may be based on density and/or size difference to distinguish
the unwanted particles from the SiO2 particles which constitute the suspension, i.e.,
which constitute the aqueous sol. Settling, depending on density, and filtration,
depending on size, is useful. A preferred separation procedure depends on centrifugation for removal
of offending particles. This approach is, at one time, sensitive both to density and
size difference. Removal of refractories such as ZrO2 and

Process for fabrication of optical fiber in accordance with which fiber

Process of claim 5 in which such sol-gel-derived glass body as
