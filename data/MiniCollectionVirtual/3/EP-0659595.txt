<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic radial tire,
particularly for construction vehicles. The invention
is concerned with improvement of durability, more
particularly improvement of side cut resistivity against
external damage of side areas of the tire.In general, since a pneumatic radial tire for a
construction vehicle runs on rough roads, side portions
can be damaged easily by stones and tree stumps. Side
cuts are classified into two groups, firstly leakage of
air caused by penetration in the side portion damaged by
shock cuts, and secondly leakage of air caused by
growing of cuts by repeated deformation resulting in
penetration and leakage of air in the side portion. In
a pneumatic radial tire for a construction vehicle,
conventionally, in addition to extension of turn-up
portions of a carcass ply to around the maximum width of
the tire, side rubber 6 having good shock cut property
or crack growth resistivity may be arranged to extend
from buttress portions of a tread to around bead
portions covering the outside of a turn-up ply, as shown
in Fig. 4(a) of the accompanying drawings, which is a
sectional view of a tire of the prior art. Further, at
least one reinforcing layer 10 may be arranged outside a
main ply, which is damaged by cuts frequently, as shown
in Fig. 4(b) of the accompanying drawings, which is a 
sectional view of another tire of the prior art.It is an object of the present invention to restrain
speed of cut growth resulting from leakage of air caused
by repeated deformation in a pneumatic radial tire for a
construction vehicle without deteriorating other aspects
of the tire performance.A tire according to the preamble of claims 1 and 2 is known from
US-A-4 086 948.According to a first aspect of the invention, there is
provided a pneumatic radial tire, particularly for a
construction vehicle, having at least one carcass ply
arranged toroidally between a pair of bead cores,
containing rubber coated steel cords disposed radially
therein, being turned up around the bead core from the
inside to the outside of the tire and the turn-up
portion of which extends to around one half height H/2
of the tire height H, characterized in that, when the
length of an overlapping portion of the turn-up portion
of the carcass ply and the main carcass ply is h1 and
the thickness of the overlapping portion is w1 within
a range of ± 0.1 H having half height H/2 of the tire
height H as the center, the length h and the thickness w
of a reinforcing rubber material arranged between the
turn-up portion of the
