<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger has flat tubes (1) parallelly arranged 
and spaced apart from each other a predetermined 

distance in the direction of thickness. The heat exchanger 
further has a pair of headers (5, 6) to which the 

ends of the tubes are connected in fluid communication. 
Each tube (1) has an intermediate bent portion (4) and 

straight sections (2, 3) separated one from another by 
the bent portion, and the bent portion (4) is a portion 

twisted at a predetermined helical angle relative to each 
straight section. Fins (11) are interposed between the 

adjacent straight sections (2), and further fins (12) 
between the other straight sections (3). The heat 

exchanger is easy to manufacture and of an improved 
efficiency of heat exchange, in spite of the tubes being 

bent in the direction of their width.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat exchanger
that is adapted for use as an evaporator, a condenser or
the like in car air-conditioners, room air-conditioners or
the like, and more particularly relates to a heat exchanger
comprising heat exchanging tubes which are bent at their
intermediate portions between opposite ends.
The preamble
of claim 1 is based on JP-A-4-187 990.The heat exchangers recently used in the car air-conditioners
are of the so-called multi-flow or parallel
flow type. Flat and straight tubes are arranged at
regular intervals and in parallel with and spaced apart
from each other a predetermined distance in the direction
of their thickness. Both the opposite ends of each
tube are connected to a pair of hollow headers, in fluid
communication therewith.In the heat exchanger of this type, heat exchange
occurs between a medium flowing through the tubes and air
streams flowing through air paths each defined between
the adjacent tubes. A certain improved heat exchanger
is proposed for example in the Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 63-282490. This type is improved in
the efficiency of heat exchange and in the drainage of
condensed dew, and is of a decreased dimension to fit in
a narrower space. Each flat tube in the heat exchanger 
of this type has, intermediate its opposite ends, a
middle portion bent in the direction of its width.It has however been difficult to protect the tube's
internal flow path from collapse when bending it in the
width direction.The United States Patents No. 5,279,360 and No.
5,341,870 propose a method of resolving this problem, in
which a plurality of grooves are previously formed along
lateral and opposite edges of a tube so that it can
easily be bent at its middle region.There are still problems in those proposals in that
the previous forming of many grooves causes much labor
and limit the portion where each tube can be bent. In
addition, cross-sectional area of the bent portion is so
decreased that a pressure loss of the coolant noticeably
increases, due to the previously formed groves.Instead of such a simple bending of tubes in the
direction of their width, a 'twisting' of tubes is proposed
in another Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. 4-187990. According to this proposal, a middle
portion located intermediate opposite straight sections
of each tube is twisted and bent such that the right side
surface of one section becomes the left side surface in
the other.This proposal may be effective to avoid the collapse
and constriction of the bent
