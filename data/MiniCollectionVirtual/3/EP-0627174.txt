<ABSTRACT>
A carbonaceous heat source comprising metal 
oxides and methods for making such heat source are 

provided. The heat source has an ignition temperature 
substantially lower than conventional carbonaceous heat 

sources, while at the same time produces virtually no 
carbon monoxide upon combustion. The heat source is 

prepared by pre-forming the carbon and binder materials 
into a desired shape, and then treating the shape with 

a sol containing metal oxide precursors. The metal 
oxide precursors are deposited in the pre-formed carbon 

shape. Further treatment converts the deposited metal 
oxide precursors into metal oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
carbonaceous heat source and to the conversion of
gaseous by-products, such as carbon monoxide, produced
by the combustion of the carbonaceous heat source and
methods to make such a heat source. The methods and
heat source of this invention are particularly suitable
for use in a smoking article such as that described in
Unites States Patent No. 4,991,606 commonly assigned
herewith.There have been previous attempts to provide
a heat source for a smoking article. While providing a
heat source, these attempts have not produced a heat
source having all of the advantages of the present
invention.For example, Siegel United States patent
2,907,686 describes a charcoal rod coated with a
concentrated sugar solution which forms an impervious
layer during burning. It was thought that this layer
would contain gases formed during smoking and
concentrate the heat thus formed.Ellis et al. United States patent 3,258,015
and Ellis et al. United States patent 3,356,094
describe a smoking device comprising a nicotine source
and a tobacco heat source.Boyd et al. United States patent 3,943,941
describes a tobacco substitute which consists of a fuel
and at least one volatile substance impregnating the
fuel. The fuel consists essentially of combustible,
flexible and self-coherent fibers made of a
carbonaceous material containing at least 80% carbon by
weight. The carbon is the product of the controlled
pyrolysis of a cellulose-based fiber containing only
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Bolt et al. United States patent 4,340,072
describes an annular fuel rod extruded or molded from
tobacco, a tobacco substitute, a mixture of tobacco
substitute and carbon, other combustible materials such
as wood pulp, straw and heat-treated cellulose or a
sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC) and carbon
mixture.Shelar et al. United States patent 4,708,151
describes a pipe with replaceable cartridge having a
carbonaceous fuel source. The fuel source comprises at
least 60-70% carbon, and most preferably 80% or more
carbon, and is made by pyrolysis or carbonization of
cellulosic materials such as wood, cotton, rayon,
tobacco, coconut, paper and the like.Banerjee et al. United States patent
4,714,082 describes a combustible fuel element having a
density greater than 0.5 g/cm3. The fuel element
consists of comminuted or reconstituted tobacco and/or
a tobacco substitute, and preferably contains 20%-40%
by weight of carbon.Published European patent application
0 117 355 by Hearn et al. describes a carbon heat
source
