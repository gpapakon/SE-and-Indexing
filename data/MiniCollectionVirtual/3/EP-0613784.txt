<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal image recording apparatus 
which comprises a thermal print head provided with a heat sink. In the thermal printing process, a dye-bearing donor ribbon is brought 
into contact with a dye-receiving print sheet at a print zone. Thermal 
printing is effected by contacting the donor ribbon with a multi-element 
print head which spans the ribbon in a direction transverse to the 
direction of ribbon travel. The print head typically comprises a linear 
array of closely spaced resistive heating elements, each being 
independently dressable by an applied voltage to heat that portion of the 
donor ribbon directly opposite and thereby cause dye to transfer from the 
donor ribbon to the print sheet. To maintain intimate contact between 
donor ribbon and print sheet during this printing operation, the donor 
ribbon and print sheet are partially wrapped over the surface of a 
rotatably driven platen roller. The amount of picture element formation on the print sheet depends on 
the temperature of the heating elements and on the temperature of the print 
head itself. The electric energy applied to the heating elements is kept 
within a prescribed range by a control circuit. The temperature of the 
print head itself, on the other hand, is kept under control by dissipation 
of the heat accumulated during printing by means of a heat sink. To that 
end, a stream of cooling air produced by a blower is directed over the fins 
of the heat sink. The blower for cooling the print head is located within the housing of 
the image recording apparatus. This has the disadvantage that the air 
heated by the heat sink circulates within the image-recording apparatus, 
thereby increasing the temperature inside this apparatus and reducing the 
life of various components, especially electric components. It has been proposed to overcome this problem by providing a thermal-image 
recording apparatus with duct means for guiding the stream of air 
having cooled the heat sink to the outside of the image-recording 
apparatus. This technique is disclosed in US-A-5 053 792. The mentioned solution does not solve, however, the problem of air 
circulation through the image-recording apparatus since all the air drawn  
 
by the ventilator means passes through a substantial part of the interior 
of the apparatus whereby environmental dust and other particles carried by 
the air become deposited in the long run on the surface of the print head, 
on rotating parts, on lubricated surfaces, etc. This deposition
