<ABSTRACT>
A curved needle (12) with a flexible leader wire (14) and a multi-stranded cable (17) fastened to the leader wire is passed through the sternum and around a vertically split in the sternum. A crimp (18) on the trailing end of the cable abuts one side of a stop bar (19) in front of the sternum. The needle and other end of the cable are passed from the other side of the bar through an aperture (21) in the bar and then separated from the leader. This procedure is repeated at the desired number of vertically spaced sites on the sternum to bring the sternum halves together under tension. A crimp (34) is swaged onto the cable at the other side of the bar whereby the crimp holds the cable in tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STERNOTO Y CABLE AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention:This invention relates generally to orthopedic surgery, and more particularly to a cable system and method for closing the sternum after open heart surgery or a similar procedure- Description of the Prior Art:For major thorasic surgery, such as open heart surgery, for example, the sternum is split from top to bottom to provide access to the organs in the thorasic cavity. Following the surgical procedure within the cavity, it is necessary to close and secure the sternum for healing. One procedure for doing this involves the making of pairs of holes in the sternum, one hole of the pair in each of the severed sides of the sternum. The hole pairs are in vertically spaced locations. A surgical wire is passed through the two holes of each pair, pulled tight to join the two halves of the sternum, and twisted together to stay tight.Another procedure intended to better distribute the forces of the wires is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,512,346 to LeMole. In that disclosure, rods 16a and 16b located on the posterior surfaces of the sternum are used as anchors for surgical wires which are then pulled and twisted together to hold the sides of the sternum together for healin .Another system disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,583,541 to Barry uses wires through vertically spaced pairs of holes in the sides of the sternum and which match the vertically spaced pairs of holes in a strap located at the front of the 

sternura and through which the wires are received and then the wires are twisted together. The knots are received in a vertically extending groove in the strap.Another system is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,730,615 to Sutherland et al, and employs a needle with an attendant metal spine portion 14 and a so-called head portion 12. The needle is the end of the spine portion and sharpened so that it can be pushed through intercostal tissue along the outer edge of the sternum, from outside toward the internal body cavity, and then pulled back out from behind the other half of the sternum. Then the locking serrations are pulled through the head portion 12 whereupon, when sufficient tension is applied, the locking of the appropriate serration with the tang 30 in the head portion will retain the fastener in place. Then the needle and excess metal spine portion are cut off.Another approach is shown in U. S. Patent No. 4,802,477 issued February 7, 1989 to Gabbay.Another approach is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,896,668 issued to Popoff

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. Sternotomy closure apparatus comprising: a curved needle having two ends, with a point at one end for piercing animal tissue, and a connection to a flexible leader at the other end; a flexible leader having two ends, the leader having one end connected to the other end of the needle; a flexible multi-strand cable having two ends; a stop on one end of the cable, the other end of the cable being attached to the other end of the leader; and an apertured bar on the cable at the stop.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 and wherein: the bar has two apertures therein, the cable being received through one of the apertures, the other aperture being sized to fittingly receive the cable through it.
3. Sternotomy closure comprising: a flexible multi-strand cable extending across behind the junction of two halves of a longitudinally split sternum, and then forward around portions of each half of the sternum to the front of the sternum and pulling the two halves of the sternum together, the cable having two end portions and ends; an apertured bar on the cable receiving the end portions of the cable through the bar; and two crimps, one of the crimps being fixed on each end portion of the cable adjacent the end of the cable, the crimps being abuttingly engaged with the bar and maintaining position of the cable ends relative to each other to thereby hold the two halves of the sternum together at the junction for healing.
4. The closure of claim 3 and wherein: the crimps have a tubular portion with a flange at one 


end radially extending from the tubular portion; the tubular portions are swaged onto the cable at the end of the cable; and the bar is mounted on the cable between the flanges of the crimps and gripped between the flanges.
5. The closure of claim 3 and wherein: the cable extends through an aperture in one half of the sternum at one side of the patient and through an aperture in the other half of the sternum at the other side of the patient, and the bar and crimps are at the front of the sternum.
6. The closure of claim 3 and further comprising: a plurality of cables and crimps like the cable and crimps of claim 3 and located at spaced points along the two halves.
7. A method of securing closed for healing, a sternum which has been split into two halves, and comprising the steps of: a. passing a needle from in front of one side of the sternum to the back of the one side and then across to the back of the other side of the sternum and then forward to a location in front of the other side of the sternum; b. pulling a multi-stranded cable along the path of the needle until a trailing end of the cable is stopped in front of the sternum; c. pulling a length of the cable through a hole in a stop member; d. closing the two halves of the sternum together at the split for healing; e. applying tension to the cable to hold the two halves of the sternum together; and f. fixing to the cable, means to hold the cable. 


 8. The method of claim 7 and wherein: steps a., b., and c. are performed at a plurality of locations longitudinally of the sternum before step d.; and steps e. and f. are performed at the locations after step d.
9. The method of claim 7 and wherein the step of fixing further comprises the steps of: placing an abutment member located on the cable at a stop fixed to the trailing end of the cable; locating a crimp on the cable at the abutment member; swaging the crimp to the cable while the crimp is abuttingly engaging the abutment member and the abutment member is abuttingly engaging the stop.
10. The method of claim 9 and further comprising the step of: cutting the cable at the crimp.
