<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
antiferroelectric liquid crystal compound having a 
terphenyl structure. Liquid crystals have excellent characteristics in 
various points of view, namely, 
1) they can be operated at a low voltage; 2) they consume only small amount of power; 3) panel type displays can be used; and 4) they are passive type matrixes. Accordingly, electrooptical apparatuses using nematic 
liquid crystals such as a DSM cell, TN cell, G-H cell, or 
STN cell have been developed and practically used. 
However, all of the electrooptical apparatuses using such 
nematic liquid crystals have a defect that response time is 
as slow as several milli sec to several tens milli sec, 
leading to a restriction in their applications. In order to solve these problems, active matrix drive 
systems using STN cells or thin-film transisters were 
developed. However, STN type displays have problems that a 
high accuracy is required in controls of cell gap and tilt 
angle and that response time is rather slow, while they are 
excellent in such qualities as display contrast and viewing 
angle. With such a technical background, the development of a 
ferroelectric liquid crystal had been attempted which has a 
spontaneous polarization (Ps), has a strong torque based on 
Ps x E (E is an applied voltage), and has an extremely 
short optical response time of a few µsec to several tens 
of µsec to make the preparation of a hypervelocity device 
possible.  
 Meyer et al. synthesized DOBAMBC (p-decyloxybenzilidene-p-ammino-2-methylbutyl 
cinnamate) in 1975 for 
the first time in the world and which was confirmed to be a 
ferroelectric liquid crystal (Le Journal de Physique, Vol. 
36, 1975, L-69). Further, since Clark and Lagawall reported in 1980 on 
such characteristics on display devices as high velocity 
response of submicroseconds and memory characteristics of 
DOBAMBC, ferroelectric liquid crystals have absorbed 
considerable public attention (N. A. Clark et al., Appl. 
Phys. Lett. 36, 899 (1980)). However, there were many technical problems in their 
system for practical use. Particularly, there was not any 
material showing ferroelectric liquid crystallinity at an 
ambient temperature, and effective and practical method was 
not established to control the molecular alignment of 
liquid crystal molecules control of which is essential for 
a display device, either. After the publication of the report, various attempts 
have been made from both aspects of liquid crystal 
materials and device. Display devices
