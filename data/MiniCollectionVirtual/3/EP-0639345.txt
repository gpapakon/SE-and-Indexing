<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulded shower 
enclosure formed in three parts one above the other, and 

including a base part (13), a central U-shaped part (14) 
and a top part (15). The enclosure has a base (25), 

defining a waste outlet (30), and a back (18) and two side 
walls (16, 17) and has no vertical joints or seams. 

Support feet (26) project downwardly from the base for 
supporting the enclosure on the ground so that waste pipes 

(31) can be located between the base and the ground (27). 
The parts (13, 14, 15) are formed at their mating surfaces 

by connectable and disconnectable fixing means (47, 48), so 
that the enclosure has its own structural stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shower enclosures and 
more particularly to shower enclosures moulded in a 
plurality of parts which fit together one above the other 
to define an enclosure having at least a base, a back wall 
and two side walls without the parts being formed with any 
vertical seams or joints. The shower enclosures with which 
the invention is mainly concerned are intended to be free 
standing in an enclosed space, normally fixed to the 
enclosure at one or more of the front edges so that they 
give the appearance of being built into the walls of a 
room. Moulded shower enclosures are known without 
vertical seams or joints and while some are formed in a 
single piece it is also known to form them from a plurality 
of parts located one on top of the other so that the parts 
can be separately manoeuvred into a room and then 
assembled. Conventionally all known such moulded shower 
enclosures, formed in several parts, have had a flat base 
supported directly on the floor with the waste outlet pipes 
extending under the floor and with each part being 
supported on the part below by horizontal mating surfaces 
resting one on the other without any securing means such as 
bolts between them. The parts have then been connected to 
the timber studs or other structural members of the 
structure around the enclosure along the top and back and 
front edges of the side and back walls. The enclosure then 
gets its stability from the large contact area between the 
base and ground and the securing means connecting the side 
and back to the surrounding structure. US-A-3382635 on which the preamble of claim 1 is 
based, shows a moulded shower enclosure having a 
plurality of sections located one above the other and  
 
formed at their mating surfaces with overlapping flanges 
secured together by fixing means. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a moulded shower enclosure, formed in a plurality of parts 
located one above the other, the base of which stands clear 
of the ground on which it is supported and which has its 
own structural strength. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
moulded shower enclosure formed in a plurality of parts 
located one above the other, the enclosure having a base, 
a waste outlet, and a back and two side walls and having no 
vertical joints or seams, the parts being formed at their 
mating surfaces with overlapping flanges secured together 
by connectable and disconnectable fixing means so that the 
enclosure has its own structural stability,

<CLAIMS>
A moulded shower enclosure (12) formed in a 
plurality of parts (13,14,15) located one above the other, 

the enclosure having a base (25), a waste outlet (30), and 
a back (19) and two side walls (16, 17) and having no 

vertical joints or seams, the parts being formed at their 
mating surfaces with overlapping flanges (40,43,75) secured 

together by connectable and disconnectable fixing means 
(47,48) so that the enclosure has its own structural 

stability, wherein the base is substantially 
planar and defines the waste outlet, characterised in that a 

plurality of support members (26) are secured to the base and project 
downwardly therefrom for supporting the enclosure on the 

ground so that waste pipes (31) can be located between the 
base and the ground, the support members being in the form 

of feet which are height adjustable relative to the base. 
An enclosure according to claim 1 characterised 
in that each support member (26) includes a bracket 

structure (36) which extends at an angle to both the back 
and side walls of the enclosure. 
An enclosure according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the support members (26) comprise 

four feet (35) arranged adjacent the corners and each 
attached to a bracket structure (36) extending at an angle 

of substantially 45Â° to the side and back walls. 
An enclosure according to any of claims 1 to 3 
characterised by a removable panel (54) extending between 

the base and ground (27) at the front of the enclosure to 
provide access, on removal, to the waste pipes (31). 
An enclosure according to any of claims 1 to 4 
characterised by a base part (13) including the base (25) 

moulded integrally with the lower portions of the side and 
back walls (16 - 18) and having an upstanding front ledge 

portion (22), and a U-shaped part (14) extending for the 
majority of the height of the enclosure and including the 

majority of the back and side walls (16 - 18). 
An enclosure according to claim 5 characterised  
 

in that the U-shaped part is a central part (14), and 
including a top part (15) providing a closed top integrally 

moulded with the top parts of the side and back walls (16 - 
18) and having a downwardly projecting front ledge (21). 
An enclosure according to claim 5 or claim 6 
characterised in that the side walls of all parts are 

provided with inwardly projecting side ledges (20) and the 
bottom ledge (22), side ledges (20) and top ledge (21) when 

provided, define the opening (23) to the enclosure, and in 
which the ledges are provided with stiffening means. 
An enclosure according to any of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the upper surface of the base is 

formed with a pattern of raised pads (28) and slopes from 
all sides downwardly towards the waste outlet (30). 
An enclosure according to any of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that at least portions of the 

interconnecting flanges (75) between the parts extend 
outwardly substantially horizontally and the fixing means 

(47, 48) extend vertically through the mating horizontal 
portions at spaced intervals. 
An enclosure according to any of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that each support member (26) includes a 

fixing member (37) moulded into the base (25).
