<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital control system 
and a digital temperature compensated crystal oscillator (DTCXO). Recent advances in IC technology promote size reduction 
and cost reduction in equipment for mobile communication such 
as devices or telephone sets for portable, mobile and cordless 
telephone systems. This progress increases the number of 
subscribers and users of the radio communication systems, and 
the carrier frequency spacing (12.5 KHz, for example) and the 
modulation band width (5 KHz, for example) are decreased. 
Therefore, a source of oscillation frequency is required to fulfill a 
severe requirement of the frequency stability. For example, the 
frequency stability must be equal to or lower than 1 ppm; |Δf/f| ≦ 
1 ppm. In a conventional TCXO (temperature compensated crystal 
oscillator), a temperature compensating network having a 
thermistor, a resistor and a capacitor is connected in series to a 
crystal unit, and designed to hold the output frequency 
approximately constant notwithstanding changes in the 
temperature of the environment by controlling the impedance of 
the circuit. This oscillator can be constituted by uncostly analog 
component parts, but its production process is not easy when a 
unit to unit variation of each component is taken into account. 
Specifically when the demand for the frequency stability is 
changing from a conventional level of ±2.5 ppm to a recent level 
of ±1.0 ppm with the recent trend toward a narrower radio 
frequency channel spacing, it is becoming more difficult to meet 
the requirement of a high precision level with the conventional 
analog type TCXO design. On the other hand, there is known a digital temperature 
compensated crystal oscillator (DTCXO) composed of a 
temperature sensor, an A/D converter, a memory section, a D/A 
converter and a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO). Data 
for temperature compensation fitted to the frequency-temperature  
 
characteristic of the VCXO is preliminarily stored (or 
programmed) in the memory such as a ROM. A control voltage is 
determined from the stored data in accordance with the sensed 
temperature of the surroundings, and applied to the VCXO to hold 
the output frequency constant. Without the need for complicated 
combination of component parts as in the analog type TCXO, the 
DTCXO is suitable for large scale integration (LSI) and automatic 
production, and promising for size reduction and cost reduction. It is an object of the present invention to improve a digital 
contr
