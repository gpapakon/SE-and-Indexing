<ABSTRACT>
Within an optical ATM node, an ATM cell to be synchronized is sent 
into a segment of pre-determined length of an optical fibre with a high time 

dispersion (FD), after having been associated, in a tunable wavelength converter 
(CL), to an optical carrier with a wavelength that is different from that with which 

the cell itself was received and such that, as an effect of the transit the fiber (FD), 
the cell reaches the input side of a switching element (Em1...Emh) of the node 

(NC) at a predetermined instant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein relates to switching nodes of fast
cell switching networks (or ATM - Asynchronous Transfer Mode -
networks) in optical technology, and more specifically it concerns a method
and device for the fine synchronization of the cells in one of such nodes.The ATM technique is taking on a growing importance for the
transport and switching of digital flows at very high speed, such as those
present in wide band integrated service digital networks. In this technique,
the information associated with the various services is organized into
contiguous packets of fixed length (about 400 bits), called "cells", formed
by an information field and a header field (tag) that carries service
information, including the information necessary for the routing through the
network.In an ATM network, the switching nodes must carry out two
fundamental tasks: routing the cells (thus performing a spatial switching
function), and avoid possible conflict situations, which occur when several
cells entering the node simultaneously from different inputs have to be
routed toward the same output (thus, the node performs a memorization
function). In order to satisfy the requirements for bit rate and bandwidth of
modern integrated services networks, ATM switching nodes based on
optical techniques have been proposed. There, both routing and 
memorization are performed by means of optical devices: in this way, it has been
possible to operate at very high bit rates, of the order of several Gbit/s.An example of a node of this type is described, for instance, in European
patent application EP-A-0 411 562 of the same applicant.In a communication system based on the ATM technique, the cells
containing information may be emitted by the various transmitting stations at random
times. In the optical systems proposed so far, there is the need for a synchronization
of the cells arriving at the various inputs of a node, so as to facilitate its operation.
In a large optical switching node, comprising a multi-stage network, there may be a
further synchronization need, due to the uncertainty about the length of the optical
paths that the cells travel through in the node. In the first case, the cell synchronization
system must be able to compensate time shifts of Â± half a cell, whereas in the
second case the time shift to be compensated may be of much smaller proportions,
in the order of a few nanoseconds.The synchronization of the ATM cells arriving at the different inputs of
a single-stage optical switching node is described in

Method of fine time realignment of ATM cells in an optical ATM switching
node, in which a cell to be realigned is sent over a segment of predetermined length

of an optical fiber with a high dispersion, after having been associated to a rephasing
optical carrier at such a wavelength that, as an effect of the fiber dispersion, the cell

reaches the input of a subsequent switching element (Em1 ... Emh) of the node (NC)
in a predetermined instant, characterized in that the beginning of the cell to be

realigned is recognized by exploiting a fraction of the optical power associated to the
cell, the time offset between the beginning of the cell and a reference instant is

evaluated, and an error signal representative of the entity of that offset is generated
and is fed forward to command the transfer of the cell from an original carrier, to

which the cell to be realigned is associated, to the rephasing carrier.
Method as claimed in claim 1, for the time realignment of cells presenting a
predetermined initial bit configuration, characterized in that the recognition of the

series-to-parallel conversion of the optical bits of the cell to be realigned, with
a degree of parallelism equal to the number of bits in the said initial configuration;
detection and conversion into logic signals of each group of optical bits resulting
from the series-to-parallel conversion;

positive outcome.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, for the generation of
the error signal, a signal of a duration proportional to the offset between the

recognition instant and the reference instant is obtained from the signal indicative
of the recognition of the beginning of the cell; such signal is integrated to obtain a

signal with an amplitude proportional to the offset, and the integrated signal is
sampled to obtain a signal of stable level. 
Method as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the signal resulting from the
sampling is equalized to compensate any possible non-linearities of means performing

the operation of association to the rephasing optical carrier.

generation of the error signal include:


a bistable device (FF), which is set by the signal at predetermined logic level
emitted by said comparison logic (COM) and is reset at the end of the cell;
a two-input logic gate (AN), which receives at a first input the signal (CK1)
representative of the reference instant and at a second input the output signal of said

bistable device (FF) and generates a pulse of a duration that is proportional to the
offset of the output signal of the bistable device (FF) with respect to the signal

representative of the reference instant;

circuit (EQ) that receives the error signal from the sample-and-hold circuit (CT) and
