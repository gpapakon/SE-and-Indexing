<ABSTRACT>
A myoplasty device (10) is anchored adjacent one end 
of a muscle (36) in the body of a patient and has a pump 

arrangement (14) having a portion (32) adapted for 
attachment to the other end of the muscle, the pump being 

actuable by contraction of the muscle. In a preferred 
application the device provides cardiac assistance. 

Conveniently, such an application utilises a relocated 
latissimus dorsi muscle, the muscle being contracted to 

actuate the pump by appropriate electrical stimulation. 
This arrangement thus utilises the muscle in the most 

efficient manner, that is in longitudinal contraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a myoplasty device, that is
a device which utilises muscle contraction for its
operation. The invention has particular application in
providing a patient with cardiac assistance utilising the
patient's own skeletal muscle.There have been a number of proposals for providing
cardiac assistance utilising a patient's own skeletal
muscle. This followed the discovery that adult fast-twitch
mammalion skeletal muscle may be conditioned to provide a
greatly increased resistance to fatigue such that skeletal
muscle may be diverted from its normal function to perform
a cardiac assist role. A major advantage of such
assistance is that the requirement for cardiac
transplantation may be avoided, and the assistance provided
by the skeletal muscle may reduce the load on the damaged
or diseased heart such that a degree of recovery is
possible.In the British Heart Journal No. 68, 1992, page 333-338,
Salmons and Jarvis review the various approaches of
providing cardiac assistance from skeletal muscle. In
cardiomyoplasty, a skeletal muscle is wrapped around the
heart to produce intermittent compression of the patient's
left or right ventricle. In aortomyoplasty, the ascending
or descending aorta is wrapped directly with skeletal
muscle. Alternatively, compression is achieved indirectly
by arranging for contraction of the muscle to inflate a
cuff placed around a blood vessel. A further approach is
to provide an independent structure that is connected to
the patient's circulation: skeletal muscle may be
configured as an auxiliary pouch-shaped or tube-shaped
ventricle by coiling it around a suitable mandrel which is
subsequently removed, leaving a skeletal muscle ventricle
or a skeletal muscle tube ventricle that can be connected
to the circulation. Alternatively, skeletal muscle may be
used to energise a mechanical artificial heart or
ventricular assist device via a mechanical, hydraulic or 
electrical link.In the majority of these approaches the skeletal
muscle is coiled or wrapped to define a chamber which is
contracted on stimulation of the muscle and dilates when
the muscle relaxes. However, the operation of such a
system relies upon radial compression of, for example, a
pouch or tube by means of a longitudinal contraction of the
coiled muscle. This is relatively inefficient and
contraction of the coiled muscle also tends to limit the
blood supply to the muscle.International Patent Application W094/06395

<CLAIMS>
A myoplasty device (10) comprising: a body including
means (16) for anchoring the device adjacent one end of a

skeletal muscle in the body of a patient; and blood pumping
means mounted on said body and including a blood inlet and

a blood outlet (20, 21) and having a portion (30, 32)
adapted for attachment to the other end portion of the

muscle in the body of the patient (14), the blood pumping
means being directly actuable to pump blood between the

inlet and outlet (20,21) by application of a longitudinal
force to said portion (30, 32) on longitudinal contraction

of the muscle.
The device of claim 1 wherein the inlet and outlet
(20
, 21) are adapted to be joined to the atrium and to the descending aorta,
respectively.
The device of any of the preceding claims wherein the
blood pumping means includes resilient means (28) adapted

to restore the blood pumping means to an original condition
on release of the longitudinal actuating force.
The device of any of the preceding claims wherein the
inlet and outlet means include one-way valves (22, 23).
The device of any of the preceding claims wherein the
blood pumping means includes a chamber (14) having a

flexible wall (28), application of the longitudinal force
to a portion of the blood pumping means resulting in

deformation of the chamber (14) to provide a part of the
pumping cycle.
The device of claim 5 wherein the chamber (14) is
arranged such that application of the longitudinal force

reduces the volume of the chamber, to expel fluid from the
chamber, the chamber then being dilated by a resilient 

means, said means being suited to pull the muscle back to
the resting length.
The device of claim 5 or 6 wherein the chamber (14) is
located on an end of the body (18) such that application of

said force compresses the chamber against the body.
The device of claim 7 wherein an upper wall and a
lower wall of the chamber each define a convex surface.
The device of claim 7 or 8 wherein a member (30) is
provided for compressing the chamber against the body (18).
The device of claim 9 wherein the member (30) extends
over the end of the body and the chamber (14), such that

application of the longitudinal force to end portions of
the member compresses the chamber.
The device of claim 10 wherein the member is in the
form of a sheet (30).
The device of claim 11 in which openings are provided
in the sheet (30) to accommodate inlet and outlet conduits

(24, 25) extending from the chamber (14).
The device of any of claims 5 to 12 wherein a flexible
balloon is located within the wall of the pump chamber or

between the pump chamber and an external, rigid casing such
that fluid may be supplied to the balloon to actuate the

blood pumping means.
The device of any of the preceding claims wherein the
body (12) is length adjustable.
