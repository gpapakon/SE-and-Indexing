<ABSTRACT>
The field of the present invention is that of devices for positioning dispersible sub-ammunition. The device for positioning sub-ammunition (1) according to the invention comprises a series of flexible tongues (16, 20, 22) regularly spaced about the sub-ammunition. The device is characterized in that the tongues are so arranged that the resultant of the aerodynamic forces acting on the sub-ammunition (1) is applied at a point to the rear of the latter's centre of gravity, and in that the tongues (22) secured to a surface (10) located in a rear part of the sub-ammunition in the direction of its path are so shaped that they undergo permanent deformation once the mine is released. Application to dispersible mines.

A device to position a sub-munition (1) on the 
ground after impact, of the bi-directive scatterable 

type, which comprises a set of flexible tabs (16, 20, 
22) evenly spaced around the sub-munition, a device 

characterized in that the distribution of the tabs is 
such that the resultant of the aerodynamic resistance to 

which the sub-munition (1) is subjected has its 
aerodynamic centre behind the latter's centre of 

gravity, and in that the tabs (22) integral with one 
face (10) located at a rear part of the sub-munition in 

the direction in which it follows its trajectory are of 
a shape such that they are subject to a permanent 

deformation when the mine is scattered. 
A positioninq device according to Claim 1 and 
intended to equip a sub-munition scattered by a carrier 

having a rotational movement, such as an artillery cargo 
shell, characterized in that the tabs are subject to a 

permanent deformation under the effect of the 
centrifugal forces. 
A positioning device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the spacing of the tabs (16, 22) 

is such that they are all integral with a face (10) 
situated on a rear part of the sub-munition (1) in the 

direction in which it follows its trajectory. 
A positioning device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the spacing of the tabs is such 

that the aerodynamic resistance which results from the 
tabs (20b) integral with a face (10) situated on the 

rear part of the sub-munition (1) in the direction in 
which it follows its trajectory is greater than that of 

the tabs (20a) integral with a face (9) opposite to the 
rear face. 
A positioning device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the number of tabs (20a) integral  

 
with a front face (9) is equal to that of the tabs 

integral with the rear face (10) and in that the surface 
area of the tabs integral with the rear face is greater 

than that of the tabs integral with the front face. 
A positioning device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the tabs (20a) integral with the 

front face (9) are made of folded wires. 
A positioning device according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that, in their deployed position, 

the tabs integral with the rear face (10) of the sub-munition 
(1) make an angle with the axis of the sub-munition 

such that the diametre (D) of a circle in which 
their free ends are distributed is greater than twice 

the height (H) of the sub-munition. 
A positioning device according to one of Claims 2 
to 7, characterized in that the deformable tabs (22) 

have a geometry such that they have a transverse section 
which steadily decreases from the base of the tab to its 

free end. 
A positioning device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the deformable tabs have a 

longitudinal opening (26) whose width steadily increases 
from the base of the tab to its free end.
