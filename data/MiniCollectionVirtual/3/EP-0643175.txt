<ABSTRACT>
The sleeve-like valve body (40) consisting of elastomeric material is arranged in the valve space (14) enclosed by the housing (10). The sleeve-like valve body (40) is fastened on the housing (10) by means of its fastening end (44) and its flow channel (42) is connected in terms of flow to the inlet opening (24). By means of its central section (50) which spans the ventilation opening (38), the valve body (40) rests against the ventilation valve seat (56) formed on the housing (10). The central section (50) is adjoined by a bead (52), which is adjoined, on the other side, by the end section (54), which rests against the valve seat element (60) under pre-stressing. With water flowing in the flow direction (S) and with the same pressure at the inlet and outlet sides, the valve body (40) resting on the ventilation valve (56) prevents water from flowing out through the ventilation opening (38). With a subatmospheric pressure on the feed side, the central section (50) is raised from the ventilation seat (56) in order to ventilate the outlet opening (28).

Sanitary safety device, especially for a sanitary 
fitting, for preventing the backflow of water into a feed 

conduit, with 

a valve space (14) which is surrounded by a housing 
(10) and which has an inlet orifice (24) intended 

for connection to the feed conduit (94), an outlet 
orifice (28) and a ventilation orifice (38), 
a sleeve-shaped valve body (40) made of elastomeric 
material, which is arranged in the valve space (14) 

and which surrounds a flow channel (42) connected to 
the inlet orifice (24) and is fastened sealingly by 

means of its fastening end (44) to the housing (10), 
a valve-seat element (60, 60') which is arranged 
fixedly relative to the housing and round which the 

valve body (40) engages in a sleeve-like manner with 
its free end portion (54) remote from the fastening 

end .(44) and on which the valve body (40) bears with 
the end portion (54) when the water flow is 

interrupted and with a negative pressure prevailing 
on the inlet side, and from which the valve body 

(40) is spaced in the event of a water flow, and 
a ventilation-valve seat (56) which is fixed 
relative to the housing and on which the valve body 

(40) bears with its outer surface in the event of a 
water flow, i
n order to prevent water from flowing 
out through the ventilation orifice (38), and from 

which the valve body (40) is lifted off when 
negative pressure prevails on the inlet side, in 

order to ventilate the outlet orifice (28), 
  
 

characterized in that 

the valve-seat element (60, 60') is of fold-resistant 
design, and 
the valve body (40) bears under prestress on the 
valve-seat element (60, 60') when the water flow is 

interrupted, has a continuous bead (52) upstream of 
the end portion (54) cooperating with the valve-seat 

element (60, 60'), and, when the water flow is 
interrupted, bears on the ventilation-valve seat 

(56) with a middle portion (50) located upstream of 
the bead (52), in order to separate the ventilation 

orifice (38) from the outlet orifice (28), and lifts 
off from the ventilation-valve seat (56) in order to 

ventilate the outlet orifice (28), only when 
negative pressure prevails on the inlet side. 
Safety device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the valve-seat element (60, 60') has a sealing 

outer surface (62) which is essentially cylindrical or 
tapers conically, as seen in the direction of flow (S), 

and which cooperates with the end portion (54) of the 
valve body (40) . 
Safety device according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the valve-seat element (60') consists of 

elastomeric material and has a fold-resistant supporting 
portion (70) and a soft sealing-lip portion (68) 

adjoining the latter, on which supporting portion (70) 
and sealing-lip portion (68) the sealing outer surface 

(62) is formed. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the valve-seat element (60, 60') 

has a holding part (58, 58') which extends in the flow 
channel (42) and which is fastened to the housing (10) on 

the side of the fastening end (44) of the valve body (40) 
facing away from the end portion (54). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the valve body (40) has, at the 

fastening end (44), a continuous fastening bolster (46),
