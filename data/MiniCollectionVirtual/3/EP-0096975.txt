<ABSTRACT>
A well logging tool for detecting low energy (E = 150 to 
300 Kev) natural gamma rays, includes a tubular housing 

member (24) which is protected from direct contact with well 
fluids (by aluminum layer 26) and is made of an epoxy gra­

phite composition to give high transmission of the low-­
energy rays. A gamma ray detector is mounted inside the 

housing. The epoxy graphite composition preferably is 
made up of graphite filament wound into tubular form and 

impregnated with an epoxy resin.
