<CLAIMS>
Method for surveying objects by means of an intelligent distance
imaging camera, the method comprising the following features:


taking of a high-resolution digital distance image of the object in
real time,
use of an active electro-optical scanning sensor as the front end of
the system,
evaluation of the distance image with algorithms for calculating
object position and orientation, object surveying and object

classification, which use the special information content of the
distance image and compare it with a geometric three-dimensional

model of the object,
on-line evaluation on a computer, which is a component of the
system,
characterised in that
 the algorithm for calculating object position and
orientation comprises the following steps:


coarse positioning to obtain a suitable position and orientation
hypothesis, three of the position and orientation co-ordinates of the

object being determined by approximation,
fine positioning for highly accurate determination of all six position
and orientation co-ordinates of the object, the result of the coarse

positioning being used as a starting value,

and that for absolute calibration of the distance measurement an optical
fibre integrated in the sensor is introduced into the optical ray path and the

light transit time through the optical fibre is measured with the sensor
electronics.
