<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a terminal connection unit for electrical cables in the power area. The object of the invention, to develop a terminal connection unit by means of which a large number of different connections (terminations) can be ensured reliably and quickly in the medium voltage range with medium-level currents, is achieved in that the housing 1, having insertion openings 2 for the insulation-piercing terminal contact elements 11 for the electrical cables, has an opening 4 and latching devices 14, 15 for arranging housings in a row, and has a cut-out 5 for arranging housings 1 one behind the other.

Terminal connecting unit for electrical cables in
a power area, having connecting contacts (3,11) and a

housing (1), characterized in that the housing (1) has
insertion openings (2) to at least two contact elements

(11) (which are electrically connected to one another)
for the electrical conductors, an opening (4) for

electrical connection of terminal connecting units via
latch and snap devices (18, 19), and latching apparatuses

(14, 15) for arranging housings (1) in a row, and a
cutout (5) for arranging housings (1) one behind the

other.
Terminal connecting unit according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the housings (1) are arranged

mechanically one behind the other via latching devices
(9, 10).
Terminal connecting unit according to Claims 1
and 2, characterized in that the terminal connecting unit

comprises two contact elements (11) which are composed of
two mutually opposite insulation-piercing terminal

elements (11), are connected to one another via a web
(12) and are connected to the latch and snap devices (18,

19), the insulation-piercing terminal elements (11) being
designed bent out to form the web (12).
Terminal connecting unit according to Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the housing (1) is provided with

a separate housing cap (7) which has two latching tabs
(16) with cutouts (17) and extends beyond the insertion

openings (2).
Terminal connecting unit according to Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the housing cap (7) is

colour-coded.
Terminal connecting unit according to Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the latch and snap device (18)

can be plugged via the opening (4) onto contacts of
terminals, and the latch and snap device (19) is connected

to a cover element (8).
