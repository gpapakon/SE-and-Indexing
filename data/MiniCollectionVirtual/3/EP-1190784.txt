<ABSTRACT>
The manufacturing method has an initial tube fitted with a thorn (6) having at least one recess (7) of defined axial width in its outer surface, before passing a drawing ring (8) with an inner diameter which is slightly less than that of the initial tube over the tube in the direction of the thorn and back in the reverse direction, so that part of the drawn tube (2) is pressed into the recess, with subsequent extraction of the thorn. An Independent claim for a device for manufacturing a tube with differing wall thicknesses is also included.
