<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions having
a controlled release, administrable by oral route, containing as the
active principle at least one salt of the gamma-hydroxy butyric acid
with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, said compositions being
suitable in particular for the treatment of alcoholism, opium like
substances addiction, heroin addiction, food and nicotine addiction,
as well as in the treatment of depressive and anxious states.In industrialized countries, alcohol has the peculiarity of being
the only pharmacological agent susceptible of a socially accepted
autointoxication, and excluding cigarettes addiction, alcoholism is
the most serious social problem in all the industrialized countries.If measured in terms of accidents, lose of productivity, crimes,
dead and diseases, the social cost of this problem is incalculable
as incalculable is the cost for ruined families, lost lives, loss
for the society and human troubles.The ethyl alcohol addiction starts when the alcohol consumption of
the individual exceeds the limits accepted by its culture, damages
its health or interferes with its social relations; alcohol
addiction occurs at any level: at the lowest levels, alcohol is 
desired or is needed both as food and as social relationship means.At a medium level, alcohol addiction happens when an individual
feels the necessity to drink in order to work or participate to
social life and tries to increase the alcohol consumption to reach
these aims. We observe a marked alcohol addiction when the
individual drinks more alcohol than the usual social and cultural
habits allow, drinks in situations in which he normally would not
and he assumes alcohol even from toxic liquids that normally are not
used as beverage.Drinking continuously alcohol, the individual needs a slight, but
continuous increase in the threshold necessary to maintain a certain
level of alcohol in the blood.Moreover a physiological and psychological adaptation take place,
and the alcoholic appears less poisoned ad less affected in the
"performance tests" at a certain concentration of alcohol in the
blood, if compared to the same test carried out on a not addicted
patients.Physiological addiction to alcohol and the abstinence syndrome
happen when the alcohol consumption is reduced below the critical
level. The damage caused to the individual by alcohol addiction can
be quantitatively higher than those caused by any other type of
addiction.Alcohol alter mental faculties and psychomotor coordination
producing a
