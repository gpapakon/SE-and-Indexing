<ABSTRACT>
For determining 3-deoxyglucosone derivatives which are 
intermediate metabolites of the Maillard reaction in 

body fluids such as blood, urine, serum, plasma and the 
like in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, ¹³C-labelled 

compounds or ¹⁴C-labelled compounds are useful as an internal 
standard substance. More specifically, 3-deoxyglucosone 

derivatives having the formula (I): 


wherein *C is ¹³C or ¹⁴C, X is O or N-OR wherein R is Me, Et or 
H, and Y is SiMe₃ or SiMe₂tBu, and their production are 

provided. The measurement of 3-deoxyglucosone derivatives 
is useful in diagnosing diseases such as diabetes and 

diseases complicated with diabetes, including diabetic 
nephrosis, various renal disorders, renal insufficiency, 

metabolic diseases of carbohydrate and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
measuring a sample in mass spectrometry by using a 
¹³C-labelled compound or a ¹⁴C-labelled compound as an internal 
standard substance. Specifically, the invention relates to a 
measuring method based upon a gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry using 3-deoxyglucosone derivatives labelled with 
¹³C or ¹⁴C. The present invention further relates to 
3-deoxyglucosone derivatives labelled with ¹³C or ¹⁴C, and to a 
process for producing the same. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to novel 3-deoxyglucosone derivatives having 
the formula (I): 
wherein *C is ¹³C or ¹⁴C, X is O or N-OR wherein R is Me, Et or 
H, and Y is SiMe₃ or SiMe₂tBu, and to a process for producing 
the same. Throughout this specification, Me refers to methyl 
group, Et refers to ethyl group and tBu refers to tert-butyl 
group.  In recent years, the Maillard reaction between 
proteins and reducing sugars such as glucose and the like is 
drawing attention as a cause of degenerating proteins or as a 
cause of various complications of diabetes. The Maillard reaction is a reaction in which a 
mixture of an amino acid or a protein together with a reducing 
sugar turns into brownish color upon heating. In a first 
stage, an amino group of a protein or an amino acid reacts 
with an aldehyde group of a sugar to form a Schiff base 
compound. A 3-deoxyglucosone derivative is an intermediate 
metabolite formed as a result of the Maillard reaction and 
exhibits a strong crosslinking action to proteins. The crosslinking, polymerization and degeneration of 
proteins are greatly affected by the Maillard reaction, even 
for those proteins having particularly long life (crystalline, 
collagen) suggesting that it is closely related to the aging 
and degeneration of proteins. It has therefore been attempted to determine the 
3-deoxyglucosone derivatives. In practice, however, there is 
available no suitable internal standard substance, and correct 
determination has not been carried out. That is, according to 
a conventional absolute method, the 3-deoxyglucosone derivative 
has been directly determined, or a reduced product thereof 
obtained with NaBD₄ has been utilized (e.g., S. Feather, et 
al., Archives Biochem Biophy., 294, 130, (1992)). The 3-deoxyglucosone derivatives are intermediate 
metabolites of the Maillard reaction and they could not be 
highly reliably analyzed from body materials and fluids such as 
blood, urine, hair, skin and tear or from the living body  
 
tissues such as
