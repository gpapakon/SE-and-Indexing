<ABSTRACT>
To subdivide the space between cylindrical hollow bodies inserted into one another into several areas (12, 13) which can be sealed off from one another, separation elements (15'') are provided which consist of a disc (16'') which can be anchored to an inner adjustable cylindrical body, for example to a well-pipe insert, and has at least one peripheral groove (17''). A retaining ring bridging the space between the inner wall of a well pipe as outer hollow body and the peripheral wall of the disc is inserted with large axial clearance into the peripheral groove of the disc (16'') by the width of the peripheral groove corresponding to at least twice the thickness of the retaining ring, and by the retaining ring thereby being able to tilt from a sealing position into a pronounced sloping position during an axial adjustment of the well-pipe insert carrying the disc (16'').
