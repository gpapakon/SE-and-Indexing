<ABSTRACT>
A threshold profiled rod (10) with a cap (12) is fixed to the floor and an in principle T-shaped profiled rod (20) is fixed to the door leaf (1). It comprises a star-shaped tilting element (24) having three legs. This tilting element is linked at its apex to a rib (22) of the profiled rod by a soft strip (29) which serves as a hinge. In addition, the connection between an inner leg (26) of the tilting element and a horizontal rib (23) is provided by means of an elastic band (26a). The figure shows the open position. When the door is closed, a lower leg (25) of the tilting element strikes the inner side of the cap, the tilting element snaps over and an outer leg (27) of the tilting element covers the outer side of the cap, at the same time as a soft sealing strip (28) comes to lie on the outer side of the cap. When the door leaf is opened, the tilting element automatically snaps back into the open position.

Sealing device for the bottom side of doors, characterised 
by the following features: 


it comprises a profiled bar (20, 40) fixedly mounted 
at the bottom side of the door leaf (1) having a horizontal 

web (23, 43), a downwardly directed web (21, 41) 
and a web (22, 42) branching off the latter; 
a tilting element (24, 44) is associated with the profiled 
bar consisting of three legs, namely an outer leg 

(27, 47), an inner leg (26, 46) and a lower leg (25, 45); 
the tilting element is connected at its vertex to the 
branching off web by means of a hinge joint (29, 48); 
the tilting element is connected at the inner leg (26, 46) 
to the horizontal web (23, 43) by means of a resilient 

strip (26a, 46a); 
the tilting element is held in an open position due to 
the tension of the resilient strip, the outer leg (27, 47) 

being supported at the horizontal web (23, 43); 
the tilting element is, when closing the door, guided 
in a closing position by engagement of a lower leg 

(25, 45) at an arch (12, 32) of a profiled bar (10, 
30) at the sill, in said closing position the outer leg 

(27, 47) taking a position inclined downwardly, a sealing 
strip (28, 49) mounted thereto engaging the profiled 

bar of the sill and being held by the tension of the 
resilient strip; 
the arrangement is made such that, when opening the 
door leaf, the tilting element is moved by the running 

up of the soft sealing strip on the arch (12, 32) so 
far that an automatic jumping back in the open position 

is achieved. 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the profiled bar of the sill is continued at the foot 

of the sill (12) by an inclined face (13) serving for 
leading off water. 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the at the end of the horizontal web (23) a drop 

nose (23b) is formed and that the profiled bar (10) of 
the sill has an upper part (14) with a discharge face 

(14b) in such an arrangement that the water dropping 
from the drop nose (23b) is received by the discharge 

face (14b) in the case of a closed door. 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the vertical web (21) of the profiled bar (20) is 

continued by an upper portion (21a) suited for being 
fastened at the door leaf by insertion in a groove (4). 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that a profiled bar (40) for being screwed onto the door 

leaf is provided which comprises a hole for a fastening 
screw (43a). 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the horizontal web (43) of the profil
ed bar (40) 
on the door leaf side is continued by a shiftably mounted 

angle bar (50) having a vertical web continued by a lip 
(51) in such an arrangement that the dropping water is 

received by the discharge face (14b). 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that a soft sealing strip is mounted at the outer leg (47) 

of the tilting element (44) having an additional sealing  
 

lip (49a) directed downwardly and a tip (49b) directed upwardly 
and serving for damping purposes. 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the profiled bar (20) to be fastened at the door 

leaf and the tilting element (24) including the strip (29) 
serving as a hinge joint and the resilient tape (26a) are 

extruded as a uniform profile, for the hinge joint (29), 
the resilient tape (26a) and, if necessary, for the sealing 

strip soft plastics material, for the other parts, however, 
hard plastics material being provided. 
Sealing device for the bottom side of doors characterised 
by the following features: 


it comprises a profiled bar (60) fixedly mounted at 
the bottom side of the door leaf (1) having a horizontal 

web (62), a downwardly directed web (62) and a 
web (63) branching off the latter; 
a tilting element (64) is associated with the profiled 
bar consisting of two legs, namely an outer leg (65) 

and an inner leg (66); 
the tilting element is connected at its vertex to the 
branching off web by means of a hinge joint (67); 
the tilting element is connected at the inner leg (66) 
to the horizontal web (61) by means of a resilient strip 

(68); 
the tilting element is held in an open position by the 
tension of the resilient strip (68), the outer leg (65) 

engaging the horizontal web, and in a closed position 
in which a sealing strip (69) mounted at the outer leg 

(65) engages the floor; 
at the door frame, on the side of the lock, a disc-like  
 

releasing element (71) is mounted having inclined guide 
faces (72, 73) by means of which the tilting element 

during closing or opening the door leaf is guided in 
a position in which the tilting element automatically 

jumps into the closed or open position, respectively.
