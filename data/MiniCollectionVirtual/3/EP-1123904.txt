<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a composition for use in forming an acid and
thermal shock resistant enamel coating having a matte finish on cast iron by dry

electrostatic spraying using a one-coat one-fire process. The composition according to
the present invention includes at least about 89% by weight of a glass component. The

glass component includes a blend of from about 45% to about 55% by weight of a first
glass frit that promotes chemical and thermal resistance, from about 15% to about 30%

by weight of a second glass frit that promotes metal out gassing, and from about 30%
to about 35% of a third glass frit that promotes bonding of the enamel coating to cast

iron. Upon firing, the composition forms an enamel coating on cast iron having a
specular gloss of about 4 to about 8 as measured according to ASTM Standard D523-89

(1994)e1 with a glossmeter geometry of 85°, a thermal shock resistance of greater
than about 425°C as measured according to ASTM Standard C385-58(1998), and an

acid resistance value of A to AA as measured according to ASTM Standard C-282-99.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for use in forming an enamel
coating on cast iron. More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition
for use in forming an acid and thermal shock resistant enamel coating having a matte
finish on cast iron by dry electrostatic spraying using a one-coat one-fire process.The application of enamel-forming compositions to metal surfaces by dry
electrostatic spraying is well known in the art and is described, for example, in Snow,
U.S. Pat. 3,928,668. In accordance with this method, dry-milled enamel-forming
powders are coated with a suitable agent to impart high resistivity, suspended in a
fluidized bed, and delivered to a spray gun that imparts a negative electric charge to
each particle. The metal article to be coated, which, if cast iron, has been pickled (acid
etched and nickel coated) and/or coated with an adherent enamel ground coat, is at
ground potential. The resistivity under ambient humidity conditions controls the rate of
charge decay and therefore the adherence of the enamel-forming powders to the metal
substrate. The coating thickness is self-limiting and thus thickness uniformity is
excellent, even on curved surfaces. The coated metal article is typically fired for about
3 to 6 minutes at 750-850°C to fuse and adhere the enamel coating to the metal
substrate. Rion, U.S. Pat. 4,110,487, describes a process by which cleaned-only-metal
surfaces, including cast iron, can be enameled via a two-coat one-fire dry electrostatic
spraying process. In accordance with this method, two layers of essentially dry frit
compositions are applied to a metal substrate by dry electrostatic spraying and then
fired only once to form a dual coat coherent ceramic layer. The first layer, which
promotes adhesion of the enamel coating to the metal substrate, fuses and stabilizes
during the firing operation at temperatures below that at which the second layer, which
promotes good acid and thermal shock resistance, fuses and stabilizes.Schittenhelm et al., U.S. Pat. 5,075,263, describes a composition for use in
forming an enamel coating on metal surfaces, particularly pickled steel, by dry
electrostatic spraying using a one-coat one-fire process. This composition, which is not
recommended for application to non-ground coated cleaned-only-metal, produces an
enamel coating having good acid and thermal shock resistance and a relatively glossy
finish. While a relatively glossy enamel coating may be desired for some applications,
enamel coatings having good acid and
