<ABSTRACT>
A protection circuit (1) comprising a first and 
second supply line (8, 9) at a first and second supply 

voltage (V
CC
, V
PP
) respectively; a reference voltage 
source (3); a comparator (2) connected to the first 

supply line (8) and the source; and a switch (30) 
controlled by the comparator via a control terminal and 

located between the second supply line (9) and the output 
(31) of the circuit (1). To reduce static 

consumption of the comparator (2) under normal operating 
conditions, the circuit (1) comprises enabling control 

elements (4-6, 29) connected to the two supply lines (8, 
9) and to the comparator (2) for disabling the 

comparator and turning on the switch (30) when the two 
supply voltages differ by a value below a predetermined 

threshold, but are greater than a reference value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protection 
circuit for devices comprising nonvolatile memories. In devices comprising nonvolatile memories, such 
as EPROMs, EEPROMs and flash-EEPROMs, the content of the 
memory must be protected in the event supply VCC is 
inadvertently cut off in the presence of programming 
voltage VPP, or in the event voltage VPP is applied 
before supply voltage VCC when the device is turned on. For this purpose, protection circuits are provided 
comprising comparators, which compare supply voltage VCC 
with a reference voltage and, if the supply voltage is 
lower than the reference voltage, disable supply of 
voltage VPP to prevent damaging the memory or altering 
the stored data. A drawback of known circuits of the aforementioned 
type is the high static consumption, not always 
desirable, of the comparators employed. EP-A-0 053 273 discloses a protection circuit for 
a nonvolatile memory. The circuit compares 
the supply voltage with a reference voltage and 
grounds the wordlines of the memory if the 
supply voltage drops below the reference voltage. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a protection circuit designed to overcome the  
 
above drawback. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a protection circuit for devices comprising 
nonvolatile memories, as claimed in Claim 1. A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawing, which shows 
a simplified electric diagram of the circuit according 
to the present invention. The circuit according to the present invention, 
indicated as a whole by 1 in the accompanying drawing, 
receives two reference voltages VCC (defining the supply 
voltage) and VPP (defining the programming voltage of 
the memory, not shown) supplied respectively over lines 
8 and 9. The circuit substantially comprises a 
comparator 2, a reference voltage VREF source 3 (both 
supplied with voltage VPP via respective P channel MOS 
transistors 4, 5), and an inverter 6 supplied with 
voltage VPP and controlled by supply voltage VCC. More specifically, comparator 2 comprises a pair 
of N channel MOS transistors 10, 11 having the control 
terminals connected respectively to VCC supply line 8 
and voltage source 3; the source terminals connected to 
each other and to a constant current source 12 (in this 
case, a MOS transistor); and the drain terminals 
connected (at nodes 13, 14) to the inputs of a current 
mirror 15 formed by two P channel
