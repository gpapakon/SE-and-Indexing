<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid encoding four novel immunodeterminant protein antigens of (M. bovis) BCG, which is a vaccine strain for tuberculosis, have been isolated. These genes were isolated as immunoreactive recombinant clones from a genomic library of (M. bovis) BCG DNA, constructed in pBR322 vector, and screened with sera collected from tuberculosis patients. The BCG DNA insert of one of the recombinants, pMBB51A, which expressed an antigen of Mr 90 kD, was sequenced completely and an ORF encoding 761 amino acids encoding a protein of deduced molecular weight 79 kD, was identified. This gene was identified to encode a membrane bound, ion-motive ATPase of (M. bovis) BCG. The approach described here can be used to identify immunogens of mycobacteria. In addition, the well-characterized (M. bovis) BCG antigens can be used in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. The 79 kD antigen is also useful in the design of recombinant vaccines against different pathogens. The sequence of the 79 kD membrane-associated polypeptides also are useful for the development of specific PCR amplification based diagnostic procedures for the detection of mycobacteria. Also, the promoter of the 79 kD antigen is useful for expressing homologous and/or heterologous antigens in mycobacteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to membrane-associated polypeptides of mycobacteria and, in particular, the use of such polypeptides and the nucleic acids encoding them for use as vaccines and diagnostic reagents.The mycobacteria are a diverse collection of acid fast, gram-positive bacteria, some of which cause important human and animal diseases. In humans, the two most common mycobacteria-caused diseases are tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy, which result from infection with M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, respectively.Tuberculosis displays all of the principal characteristics of a global epidemic disease. Currently, tuberculosis afflicts more than 35 million individuals worldwide and results in over 4 million deaths annually. In India, at any given time, almost 8 million people are reported to suffer from this disease and 500,000 deaths recorded. These figures may not cover the totality of those suffering from this disease in this country. Thus, tuberculosis appears to be a problem of major concern in India as also in many other countries of the world.Tuberculosis is caused by M.tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum and M. microti, the acid-fast, Gram positive, tubercle bacilli of the family Mycobacteriaceae. Some local pathogenic strains of M. tuberculosis have also been isolated from patients in Madras and other cities in India, which differ in some respects from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, which is a virulent strain.In recent years, certain groups of individuals with AIDS have been found to have a markedly increased incidence of TB as well. It has now been shown that one group of mycobacteria which consists of M.avium, M. intracellulare and M. scrofulaceum, jointly known as MAIS complex, is responsible for disseminated disease in a large number of persons with AIDS (Kiehn et al., j. Clin. Microbiol., 21:168-173 (1985); Wong et al., Amer. J. Med., 78:35-40 (1985)).Since Koch identified M. tuberculosis as the causative agent of tuberculosis in 1882, many scientific studies and public health efforts have been directed at diagnosis, treatment and control of this disease. However, characteristics of M.tuberculosis have hampered research to improve diagnosis and to develop more effective vaccines. In addition, the biochemical composition of the organism has made identification and purification of the cellular constituents difficult, and many of these materials once purified, lack sensitivity and specificity as diagnostic reagents. As a result, diagnostic and immunoprophylactic measures for mycobacterial diseases have
