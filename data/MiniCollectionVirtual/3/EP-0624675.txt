<ABSTRACT>
A warp feed controller for use in a twin beam weaving 
machine having a first tension detector (TS) for detecting the tension 

of at least one of the groups of warp yarns fed in sheet-like 
forms from a pair of warp beams (B1,B2), a first control system (10) 

for 
controlling the rotation of one of the warp beams (B1,B2) on the basis 

of 
the tension deviation from a target tension (To) under detection of 

the tension (T) by said tension detection means, a pair of second 
tension detectors (TA1,TA2) for detecting the tensions of the warp 

yarns 
fed from the warp beams (B1,B2) in boundary portions of the sheet-like 

forms, and a second control system (20) for controlling the rotation 
of the other of the warp beams on the basis of the tension difference 

output from the second tension detectors, respectively. 
The first control system controls the one warp beam (B1) so that the 

tension of the warp yarns becomes equal to a target tension (To), 
while the second control system controls the other warp beam (B2) so 

that the tensions of warp yarns in the boundary portions are 
become equal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a twin-beam weaving machine 
using a pair of left and right warp beams to weave a textile 
fabric having a large breadth and, more particularly, to a warp 
feed controller of a twin beam weaving machine designed to reliably 
prevent occurrence of a wale streak defect in a central 
portion of a fabric. Weaving machines capable of weaving a textile fabric 
having a large breadth by a pair of left and right warp beams are 
known for long as twin beam weaving machines. In such twin beam weaving machines, if tensions of warp 
yarns from the warp beams are unbalanced, a noticeable wale 
streak occurs in a warp boundary portion, i.e., a central portion 
of the fabric. Twin beam weaving machines therefore require a 
special means arranged to balance the tensions of warp yarns fed 
from the warp beams (for example, as in the weaving machine 
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Sho 61-180184. For example, the difference between two groups of warp 
yarns from the warp beams may be canceled by detecting the tensions 
of the warp yarns fed from the warp beams with tension  
 
detectors when the left and right beams are driven through a 
differential gear mechanism connected to a common drive shaft, 
and by braking one or both the warp beams on the basis of tension 
signals from the tension detectors. That is, the tension detectors 
are disposed at positions corresponding to two side end 
portions of a fabric, the tension signals from the tension detectors 
are compared by a comparison control means, and the braking 
force of brakes interposed between the differential gear mechanism 
and the warp beams are controlled according to the result of 
the comparison. This prior art entails the problem of difficulty in 
completely preventing occurrence of a wale streak in a central 
portion of a fabric, because the tensions of warp yarns from the 
warp beams are measured at positions corresponding to two side 
end portions of the fabric. That is, in general, the tensions of warp yarns are not 
always constant in the widthwise direction of the warp beams, but 
are liable to be smaller in side end portions of a fabric 
and to be larger in a central portion of the fabric, and the 
magnitude of the tension variation ordinarily disperses with 
respect to the warp beams. This is because weft yarns tend to be 
looser in side end portions of the fabric so that the amount 
of warp yarns consumed is smaller, because dispersions of 
slashed states and dispersions of the wound hardness in a
