<ABSTRACT>
An air outlet ventilation installation, in particular for hall-like interiors, is arranged at the outlet of an air supply duct (1) and has at least a propelling nozzle (3) for a propelling air jet and a discharge field (4) provided with a plurality of discharge openings adjacent to the propelling nozzle (3) to draw trailing air out of the air supply duct. At least one shield (5) which laterally extends approximately in the direction of the air jet is associated to at least the propelling nozzle (3). The shield (5) at least partially covers the discharge area of the propelling nozzle (3) and protects it against the inflow of ambient air. Thanks to the shield (5), trailing air is drawn mainly out of the discharge field (4) by the kinetic energy of the air jets that leave the propelling nozzles.

<CLAIMS>
An air outlet for a ventilation installation for
ventilating rooms, in particular hall-like rooms, which

is arranged at the outlet of an air supply duct (2) in
each case, and having at least one propelling nozzle

(3) for a jet of propelling air and a discharge field
(4) adjoining the propelling nozzle (3) for trailing

air which has to be removed from the air supply duct
(2), which field has a plurality of discharge openings,

characterised in that at least one shield (5, 6)
extending laterally approximately in the direction of

the jet is associated with at least the propelling
nozzle (3) likewise supplied with air from the air

supply duct (2), which shield at least partially
protects the discharge region of the propelling nozzle

(3) from the ingress of ambient air, the free passage
cross-section of the part of the discharge field (4)

associated with the propelling nozzle (3) being greater
than the free passage cross-section of the propelling

nozzle (3), but having a higher passage resistance than
the propelling nozzle (3).
An air outlet according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the shield (5) is formed at least in part by a

duct-like extension (6) of the air supply duct which
projects beyond the discharge plane of the propelling

nozzle (3) in the direction of the jet and which has at
least part of the discharge field (4) for trailing air.
An air outlet according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the discharge field (4) is in the

form of a duct-like extension (6) which at least
partially surrounds the propelling nozzle (3). 
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the discharge field (4) is

oriented at least in part substantially at right-angles
to the jet axis of the propelling nozzle.
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that at least part of the discharge

field (4) is oriented at an angle to the jet axis (7)
of the propelling nozzle (3), the discharge openings

facing the jet axis (7).
An air outlet according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the discharge plane (9) of the discharge

openings of the discharge field (4) is oriented
approximately parallel to the discharge plane of the

propelling nozzle (3).
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the propelling nozzle (3) is

adjustably mounted relative to its jet axis (7).
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the discharge field (4) is formed

by a perforated plate.
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the orientation of the shield (5)

is arranged to be changeable relative to the direction
of the jet, in particular pivotable.
An air outlet according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the shield (5) is provided with

perforations at least over part of its surface.
