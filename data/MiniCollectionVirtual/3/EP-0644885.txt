NOVEL BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE EBURNAMENINE DERIVATIVES, PHARM CEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND PROCESS F PREPARING SAMEThe invention relates to novel biologically acti eburnamenine derivatives of the general formula
 whereinR1 and R2 as well as R3 and R4, independently from ea other, stand for hydrogen, C2_6alkyl group, C2— al enyl group; or a C3_*-Loalicyclic group involving 1 3 rings, and this latter group may be substituted by Cι_ al yl or C2_gal enyl group; orR1 and R2 and/or R3 and R4, together with the adjace nitrogen atom and optionally with an additional oxyg or nitrogen atom, form a 4— to 6—membered, saturat or unsaturated cyclic group which may be substitutA 4869-67 MR 

 by a C*]__6alkyl or C2— alkenyl group; two of X, Y and Z are nitrogen whereas the third of th means a methine group; n is 1 or 2; W means oxygen or two hydrogen atoms; and the wavy line means — /a—, a—/β— or β— / — steric position, as well as their acid additions salts, solvates and pharm ceutical compositions containing these compounds. Furthe more, the invention relates to a process for the preparati of the above compounds and to a method for inhibiting t peroxidation of lipids in mammals.In the forthcoming formulae the eburnamenin-14-yl gro will hereinafter be abbreviated "EBU"; thus any reference the meaning of the wavy line relates to said line bei present in the partial formula "EBU".C2H5The compounds of the formula (I) according to the inve tion are new and possess a significant antioxidant (lip peroxidation-inhibiting) effect. Thus, they are therape tically useful.There are a high number of pathologic processes known the case of which extremely reactive free oxygen radica (O2"") are accumulated. The formation of these free radica leads to the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (lip peroxidation) which are important components of the ce membranes. This is a less specific, cell-destroying proces altering or damaging the biomoleculeε. In this proces functions of various levels of cells, organs or the who organism may suffer injuries. 

 Free radical reactions likely play a causal role in t pathogenesis of ischae ia-induced injuries such as ischaem intestinal diseases, myocardial ischaemia, haemorrhag shock, cerebrovascular function disturbances accompanied ischaemia and renal ischaemia [R. J. Korthuis et al "Physiology of Oxygen Radicals", Chapter 17, pages 217-2 (1986) ] .Due to their lipid peroxidation-inhibiting effect, ant oxidative compounds assure a protection against injuri induced by free radicals under
