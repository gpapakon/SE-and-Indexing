includes sequentially from an object side: a first lens 

group which has a positive refractive power and is 
fixed relative to an image plane; a second lens group

have a magnification changing function; a third lens 
group which has a positive refractive power and is 

fixed relative to the image plane so as to have a light 
converging function; and a fourth lens group which has 

a positive refractive power and is movable on the 
optical axis so that the image plane displaceable in 

response to travel of the second lens group and movement 
of the object is fixed at a position spaced by a 

predetermined distance from a reference face. An air 
space is provided between the third and the fourth lens 

groups. When viewed sequentially from the object side,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aspherical zoom lens
as acknowledged in the opening clause of claim 1 and a video
camera as acknowledged in the opening clause of claim 7.More particuarly, the present invention relates to a
high-performance aspherical zoom lens for use in a 3-CCD
(charge coupled device) type video camera or the like, which
has a high zoom ratio and a long back focal distance.In response to recent demands for excellent operational
efficiency, good mobility and high image quality in video
cameras, high-resolution and compact imaging devices are
becoming a mainstream of imaging devices. Meanwhile, in this
connection, high-performance and high-magnification zoom
lenses which have a large aperture ratio, are compact in size
and light in weight are in strong demand. Furthermore, due to
a big demand for the reduction of production costs of zoom
lenses, high-performance and high-magnification zoom lenses in
which the number of lens components is reduced are in urgent
need. However, in known high-magnification zoom lenses, not
only the diameters and overall length of lenses become large
in order to realize the high magnification, but a large number
of lenses are required to be used for performing more strict
aberration corrections. As a result, conventional video
cameras including the zoom lenses become larger, heavier, and
more expensive and therefore, the zoom lenses have not been
suitable for use in video cameras for home use.Hereinafter, an exemplary zoom lens for use in a video
camera is described with reference to Figure 2 (for example,
see Japanese Patent Application No. 3-232840 corresponding
to EP-A-0 531 925 Al).Figure 2 is a view showing the structure of a
conventional zoom lens 200 for use in a video camera. As is
shown in Figure 2, the zoom lens 200 includes a first lens
group 21 acting as a light converging portion, a second lens
group 22 acting as a magnification changing portion, a third
lens group 23 acting as a light converging portion, a fourth
lens group 24 acting as a focusing portion, a color
separation optical system 25, and a glass plate 26 which is
optically equivalent to a quartz crystal filter, a face
plate of an imaging device, and the like. The reference
numeral 27 denotes an image plane.The operation of the zoom lens 200 having the above-described
arrangement is now described. The first lens group
21 is fixed at a predetermined position relative to the
image plane 27, and has an image forming function. The
second lens group 22 is movable on an optical axis so as
