<ABSTRACT>
A theft-protection device for locking the hand brake of a vehicle. The device comprises a sleeve (16, 26) secured to the hand brake and receiving the end of the hand brake which has the release button (34), and a key-operated push barrel (10) comprising a locking member (22) which prevents actuation of the release button (34) when the barrel (10) is operated by the key. The device forms a self-contained assembly separate from the hand brake, and can be fitted to any existing hand brake. The sleeve has one end (16) containing the barrel and is secured to the hand brake via a joining means such as an adhesive combined with turned screws at its other end (26), enabling the device to be fitted easily and without specialist help.
