<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent product containing sphagnum moss 
selected from the group of botanical sections consisting 

of PALUSTRIA, ACUTIFOLIA, RIGIDA, SUBSECUNDA and 
CUSPIDATA. The invention also extends to a novel method 

for manufacturing a highly absorbent structure and to a 
method for evaluating the liquid absorbent properties of 

a sphagnum moss composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel sphagnum moss
composition for the production of a liquid-absorbent
medium suitable for use in disposable absorbent articles
such as sanitary napkins, tampons, diapers, adult briefs,
urinary pads, wound dressings and the like. The novel
composition comprises primarily sphagnum moss species
selected from the botanical sections of PALUSTRIA,
ACUTIFOLIA, RIGIDA, CUSPIDATA, SUBSECUNDA and combinations
thereof. The invention also extends
to a novel method for manufacturing an
unusually absorbent, structurally integral product
containing sphagnum moss material.The prior art has recognized the potential of
sphagnum moss material for use as an absorbent medium in
structures for absorbing body exudate. Sphagnum moss has
highly desirable liquid-absorption properties such as a 
remarkable absorption capacity and the ability of
desorbing adjacent materials by continuing to pull or wick
liquid away from them over a long time period such that
virtually all the liquid is collected in the sphagnum moss
core. These attributes allow the material to provide
highly efficient absorbent components which can be made
relatively thin for better fit, comfort and discretion,
while being sufficiently absorbent to prevent overflow
leakage and garment staining.The following United States Patents document the use
of sphagnum moss material for manufacturing absorbent
components for disposable absorbent products:

herein by reference. Sphagnum moss material for use in manufacturing
absorbent components is harvested from a sphagnous bog and
transported to the processing site where it is refined and
converted into a structurally integral continuous sheet.
In sheet form, the sphagnum moss material can be
conveniently rolled-up for storage and transportation and
it is suitable for direct processing in the high speed
automatic equipment that is currently used by the industry
for assembling multi-layer disposable absorbent products.Broadly stated, the process for converting raw
sphagnum moss into a structurally integral continuous
sheet begins with forming the raw material into an aqueous
slurry that is wet classified to extract from
