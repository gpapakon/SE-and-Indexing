<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a vibration dampening grinding cup (1) for handheld grinding machines for the grinding of hard metal buttons on button bits, comprising a grinding head (2) and a shaft (3) made with a common axial channel (4) for cooling medium, which distinguishes in that the shaft (3) is formed with a driver part (5) at its free end and an annular groove (6) between this part and the grinding head, and that a bushing (7) of rubber is arranged on the shaft adjacent to the grinding head, and a holder (10) for such a grinding cup, which distinguishes in that it comprises a substantially cylindrical socket (11) with an axial through channel (12), whose one end is connected with the rotor of the handheld grinding machine and through the other end of which the shaft (3) of the grinding cup (1) is intended to be entered for installing the driver part (5) of the shaft in a correspondingly formed driving part (13) in the channel of the socket and to be fastened through introduction of balls (14) situated in holes in the wall of the socket at the other end of the socket into the annular groove (6) of the shaft at the inner edge of the groove by means of a between two stops axially movable sleeve (15) arranged about the socket and biassed towards the other end of the socket by a spring, whereby the bushing with fastened grinding cup rests elastically against the socket and against the grinding head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vibration dampening grinding cup for handheld grinding 
machines for grinding hard metal buttons on button bits, comprising a grinding head and 
a shaft made with a common axial channel. In handheld grinding machines one has hitherto used a conventional clamping sleeve, 
so-called chuck, as holder for grinding cups for the clamping of the grinding cup, see 
GB-A-2 081 174. Through the stationary direct contact between the grinding cup and 
the clamping sleeve this connection becomes stiff and vibrations generated in the 
grinding cup will thus easily be transferred to the handle of the grinding machine and 
thus to the hands and arms of the operator, which at longer exposure may lead to white 
fingers, which is a contraction of the blood-vessels restricting the blood circulation in 
the fingers, and also to nerve damage in the hands. The aim with the present invention is to prevent that vibrations of the grinding cup are 
transferred to the hands of the operator and thus prevent that white fingers and nerve 
damages in the hands arise. This goal is achieved with the vibration dampening grinding cup according to claim 1, 
whereby the grinding cup is distinguished in that the shaft is formed with a 
driver part at its free end and an annular groove between this part and the grinding 
head, allowing axial movement of the grinding head, and that a vibration dampening 
bushing is arranged on the shaft adjacent to the grinding head Through the constructive design of the grinding cup one obtains, instead of the earlier 
stationary stiff connection between grinding cup and clamping sleeve, a flexible and 
through the bushing at the same time vibration dampening connection between grinding 
cup and holder. The bushing has a number of bosses at its side turned towards the 
grinding head and the form of a trucncated cone at its side turned away from the 
grinding head. The invention is described more in detail below with reference to the accompanying 
drawing in which fig 1 schematically and partly in longitudinal section shows a grinding  
 
cup and a holder therefor according to the invention connected, fig 2 the holder in fig 1 
separately and fig 3 the grinding cup in fig 1 separately. As is shown in the drawing, particularly fig 3, the grinding cup 1 according to the 
present invention comprises a grinding head 2 and a shaft 3 which are made with a 
common channel 4 for cooling medium, e.g. water or air. In contrast to the shafts of 
hitherto used grinding cups, in which the shaft

said bushing at its side turned toward the grinding head having a number of bosses (8) 
and at its side turned away from the grinding head being formed as a truncated cone.
