<ABSTRACT>
In order to permit elastic absorption of the rock pressure occurring after the excavation of the tunnel in the case of tubbing rings which are composed of individual tubbing segments (1, 1'), compressible thrust bearings (2) are inserted between these segments. Each thrust bearing (2) is a box of elastically deformable material which has several hollow spaces in its interior. The boxes are compressed by the rock pressure until the hollow spaces are filled by the box material. The diameter of the tubbing ring is accordingly reduced. The deformation of each thrust bearing can be accurately controlled by appropriate dimensioning of the hollow spaces and also by filling the same with material when required and by controlled discharge of this material.

Controllably squeezable thrust bearings for tubbings in a 
tubbing ring consisting of a box (2) of elastically deformable 

material which is intended to be arranged between two adjacent 
tubbings, can be squeezed in height by compression of the 

thrust bearing and the resultant convergence and has several 
deformable cavities (5) in its interior, which are separated 

from one another by webs (3, 4), characterised in that one set 
of webs (3) as well as the other set of webs (4) extending 

transversely thereto extend from one support side of the box 
(2) in the compression direction to its other support side, 

these support sides consisting of a grid-like arrangement of 
the cavities (5) extending transversely to the compression 

direction and the cavities (5) being intended to end the 
reduction, occurring during compression of the thrust bearing, 

in the spacing between the two support surfaces by eventually 
complete filling with the material of the webs (3, 4) which 

yields laterally to the direction of the reduction in spacing, 
the webs having a thickness which can be predetermined on the 

basis of the desired reduction in spacing resulting from the 
proportion of the total volume of all cavities (5) in the non-compressed 

state of the box (2) relative to its volume as 
defined by length, width and height. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the total volume of all cavities (5) is half the volume 

of the box. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cavities (5) are filled with a plastically deformable 

material (9). 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cavities (5) are connected to one another by openings 

(10, 11) in the webs (3, 4).  
 
Thrust bearing according to claim 4, characterised in 
that all openings (10, 11) have the same cross section. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the openings in the webs which extend parallel to one set 

of walls of the box (2) have a different cross section from 

those in the webs extending parallel to the other set of 
walls. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the openings in any one of the webs have different cross 

sections from one another. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 3, characterised in 
that in the interior of at least a few cavities (5) there 

extends a pipe (12, 12') which connects them, is provided with 
holes (13) for the passage of a proportion of the material (9) 

and exits from the box at a position of the box so as to allow 
the material (9) pressed into the cavities through the holes 

(13) to flow out during squeezing of the box. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 8, characterised in 
that members (14, 15) for measurable regulation of the 

pressure in the interior of the cavities (5) influenced by the 
egress of the material (9) and the squeezing of the box are 

arranged at said exit position. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cavities (5) are open at the top and bottom. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the webs (3, 4) have upper and lower ends which are 

concave in order to form sharp sealing edges (16). 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cavities are sealed at the top and bottom by covers 

(17).  
 
Thrust bearing according to claim 12, characterised in 
that at least one of the covers (17) is provided with 

projections (18, 19) for securing the box (2) on its support. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the thrust bearing is surrounded by a portion of the 

sealing frame (20, 20', 29) and, for this purpose, has grooves 
(23) for receiving this portion. 
Thrust bearing according to claim 14, characterised in 
that this portion, either itself or together with a portion of 

a further sealing frame or the other sealing frame alone, has 
means (27, 31, 33) which seal the cavities of the thrust 

bearing (2) against the admission of water under the influence 
of a water pressure.
