<ABSTRACT>
In a rotatable filter, such as a disk filter, for separating solid particles from a liquid mixture, in which a filter material (3) is partially immersed, a cake-removal member (11) is designed to take off a layer of the formed cake of solid particles from the filter material, so that a liquid-permeable coating, which itself acts as a filter medium, is left on the filter material which is moved down into the liquid mixture which is to be separated. According to the invention, for renewing the said coating a spraying means (13-17) is designed to spray jets of liquid in at least one spray zone (18), through which only a part of the filter material passes upwards during the rotating movement of the filter material, so that the whole cake of coarse particles, including the coating, is removed from the said part of the filter material by the jets of liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement 
for separating solid particles from a liquid mixture, 
comprising a hollow filter body with a wall of filter 
material, and a container for the liquid mixture which is 
to be separated, the filter body being arranged partially 
immersed in the liquid mixture. A drive member is 
designed to rotate the filter body about a horizontal 
axle, so that the wall of filter material is rotated up 
and down through the surface of the liquid mixture. A 
pressure source is designed to generate a higher pressure 
on the outside of the filter body than on the inside of 
the filter body, so that a fine fraction of the liquid 
mixture is forced through the filter material, while a 
cake of solid particles is deposited on the filter 
material and accompanies the latter up over the liquid 
mixture during rotation of the filter body. A cake-removal 
member is designed to take off a layer of the 
cake from the filter material above the liquid mixture, 
so that a liquid-permeable coating of solid particles is 
left on the filter material which is moved down into the 
liquid mixture during rotation of the filter body. The 
arrangement moreover comprises a discharging member for 
discharging the said removed cake layer from the 
arrangement, and means for spraying the filter material 
with jets of liquid above the liquid mixture for the 
purpose of removing the said coating of solid particles 
for renewal thereof. Arrangements of this type are used in the paper 
pulp industry, especially for purifying white liquor, 
green liquor and lime sludge (calcium carbonate) in 
causticization processes. The renewal of the said coating of solid 
particles is necessary due to the fact that the liquid-permeability 
of the coating deteriorates after a certain  
 
running period. In a known arrangement of this type, 
which consists of a drum filter for purifying lime 
sludge, the coating of solid particles is renewed by the 
spraying means removing a strip of the coating from the 
filter drum. A jet of liquid from the spraying means is 
in this case moved to and fro axially along the filter 
drum on its down side and between the cake-removal member 
and the liquid mixture. A disadvantage of the known 
arrangement is that the spraying means must be designed 
to spray the jet of liquid at a high pressure in order to 
guarantee to some extent the removal of the coating, 
since the coating is especially dry and hard between the 
cake-removal member and the liquid mixture. In practice, 
the
