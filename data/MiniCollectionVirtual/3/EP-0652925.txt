<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detergent compositions containing
crystalline layered silicates , an alkali metal percarbonate bleach and
ethylenediamine-N, N'-disuccinic acid or salts thereof.Detergent compositions incorporating layered sodium silicates are
known in the art, being disclosed in, for example, DE-A-3413571,
DE- A-3812556 and EP-A-0337219. These disclosures teach that
the layered crystalline forms of sodium silicate display superior
mineral hardness sequestration ability relative to the corresponding
silicate salts in amorphous form and are thus advantageous as
detergent builder materials.Laundry detergent compositions containing the nil-phosphorus
chelant, ethylenediamine-N, N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) are also
known in the art, being disclosed in, for example, EP-A-0267 653.
This disclosure teaches that EDDS when incorporated in such
laundry compositions assists in the removal of food, beverage and
certain other organic stains from fabrics during the laundry process.
It also teaches that EDDS may be used as a replacement for all or
part of the phosphonate chelants currently used in many existing
laundry products.Detergent compositions containing sodium percarbonate are known
in the art. Sodium percarbonate is an attractive perhydrate for use in
detergent compositions because it dissolves readily in water, is 
weight efficient and, after giving up its available oxygen, provides a
useful source of carbonate ions for detergency purposes.Considerable interest exists in the development of more
'environmentally friendly' detergent compositions and processes for
washing laundry in the home. The term 'environmentally friendly'
as applied to home wash processes has many connotations, but will
include those processes which consume less energy, by operating at
lower temperatures and/or using lower volumes of water.
'Environmentally friendly' detergent compositions are often
characterised in that they minimize the levels of components which
may cause environmentally undesirable effects. These components
may include for example any components which contain phosphorus,
which has been linked to undesirable effects in lakes and rivers, and
any components which contain boron whose persistence in the
environment is also of possible concern.Detergent compositions of the so-called 'compact' type which are of
higher bulk density and contain lower amounts of filler salts than
conventional laundry detergent products also provide an
environmental benefit in that these provide equivalent performance
from a smaller
