<ABSTRACT>
An ink tank cartridge (5) is disclosed including a housing (11,50) removeably
mounted onto an ink supply needle (14,90) of the ink-jet type recording apparatus

body. The housing being provided with an ink supply port (15,53,71) projecting
outwardly from a bottom surface of the housing. A porous member (21,64) for

impregnating ink is positioned inside the housing abutting against the ink supply port
through a filter (17,55). The ink tank cartridge being further provided with a packing

member (19,57,73) resiliently abutting against an outer periphery of the ink supply
needle at the end of the ink supply port. An end opening is sealed with a sealing

member (20,60,77) through which the ink supply needle penetrates.
Accordingly, the ink tank cartridge of the invention is advantageous in that the
ink supply needle does not require a sharp tip, air is prevented from entering the ink

supply path of the recording apparatus, and a tight air-seal between the ink supply
needle and the ink tank can be maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an ink tank cartridge for use in an ink-jet
type recording apparatus for ejecting ink droplets onto a recording medium and
more particularly to a structure of an ink tank cartridge for use in the ink-jet type
recording apparatus.Generally, according to the recording apparatus of this type, an ink is supplied
to a recording head from an ink tank constructed as a cartridge. Employment of the
ink cartridge acting as an ink tank has advantages in that no smear is likely to occur due
to the leakage of ink while refilling new ink or the like. However, undesired air
bubbles can easily enter the tank which may cause problems, such as ink-failure.In order to prevent air bubbles from entering the ink tank, several techniques
have been proposed. For example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Application (OPI)
No. Hei. 3-92356 discloses an ink-jet recording apparatus in which an ink supply port
disposed below an ink tank is constituted by a rubber tap. A metal ink supply needle
penetrates through the rubber tap into an ink flow path communicating with ink nozzles
of a recording head. The ink supply needle has ink supply holes on a side surface
thereof to penetrate easily through the rubber tap, the diameter of which is about 1mm
and is constituted by a metal pipe formed of an anti-corrosion material, such as
stainless steel and the end of the pipe is extremely sharp. Accordingly, a person must
operate the sharp needle very carefully or (s)he may be injured by the tip of the needle.To overcome the above problem and difficulty, Unexamined Japanese Patent
Application (OPI) No. Sho. 50-074341 proposes an arrangement in which a packing
member having a through hole is previously provided at an end opening of an ink
supply port and the through hole of the packing member is sealed by a seal member. 
According to this arrangement, an ink supply needle having a tip which is not so sharp
can be employed.However, in any event, those conventional ink-jet recording apparatuses use an
ink tank in which a liquid ink is contained directly therein. Accordingly, the
apparatuses suffer from several problems such as leakage of ink or a waterhead
difference; waterhead being a term explained hereafter.It is advantageous to maintain an ink supply pressure (negative pressure) from
an ink tank to a recording head within a range from -30 to -100 mmAq (i.e. a
waterhead) so as to achieve a stable ink ejection of the recording head of the ink-jet
type recording apparatus. However, it is difficult to control
