<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for call forwarding in switching systems with program-controlled exchanges which enable programmable call forwarding controlled by a subscriber, it is provided, in order to allow call forwarding to be initiated, even from any given remote terminal, that a call forwarding control circuit is provided at the subscriber end which, in response to code signals which are transmitted via a connection set up from a remote subscriber terminal to the subscriber, transmits the control signals required for the setting of a desired call forwarding to the assigned exchange.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit configuration for call forwarding in telephone exchange installations
with program controlled switching units which are programmed to

enable the call forwarding process to be controlled by a subscriber,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises

means (30) for connecting the circuit configuration to an ISDN branch

line that comprises a minimum of two ISDN channels, and
means (21, 32) for evaluating code signals received via one first ISDN
channel, for generating control signals on the basis of the evaluation of

the code signals received via branch line, and for transmitting the
control signals to the switching unit via a second ISDN channel, while

maintaining the first ISDN channel.
Circuit configuration according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a control unit (21).
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a S
0
 connection unit (32).
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 3,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a memory (23) for storing the code
signals received. 
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 4,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a digital/analog converter or an
analog/digital converter respectively and a virtual switching element

(38).
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 5,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a DTMF decoder (17) and a DTMF
tone output unit (18).
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 6,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises means for recognizing a password
transmitted by the remote subscriber, which is transmitted together with

the code signals.
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 7,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises a timer which is by means of
signals transmitted together with the code signals transmitted by the

remote subscriber programmed in such a way that the setting or changing
of the call forwarding can be controlled in terms of time by means

of the control signals.
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 8,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration comprises means for transmitting the settings
of the call forwarding to the remote subscriber in response to request

signals transmitted by the remote subscriber. 
Circuit configuration according to one of the Claims 1 - 9,

characterized in that

the circuit configuration is attachable to the branch line by means of
a connection in the form of a separate device.
