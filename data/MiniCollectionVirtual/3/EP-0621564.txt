<ABSTRACT>
A traffic accident data recorder is disclosed. The traffic 
accident data recorder 1 comprises an acceleration sensor 3, an 

angular velocity sensor 4 if necessary, a memory 8, and a control 
section 7 for controlling the recording in the memory 8. When the 

output datum from the acceleration sensor 3 or angular velocity 
sensor exceeds a predetermined value, the control section 7 

recognizes that time as a traffic accident occurrence time, and 
keeps the acceleration data and angular velocity data before and 

after then or after then in the memory 8. By analyzing the data 
with a traffic accident data reproduction system, it is possible to 

reproduce the state at the traffic accident occurrence time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traffic accident data
recorder mounted on a means of land transportation such as a car,
a means of marine transportation such as a ship, an aircraft, or the
like, to store acceleration and angular velocity data of the
transportation means at a traffic accident (as conceived to be a
general term for accidents of transportation means which occur on
the earth, on the sea and in the air) occurrence time, and to a
traffic accident reproduction system for reproducing the traffic
accident by using the traffic accident data stored in the traffic
accident data recorder.Generally, it is very advantageous to know the state of a means
of transportation when a traffic accident has occurred to the
means, in order to look into the cause of the accident. As a
representative for storing data at a traffic accident occurrence
time, a flight recorder mounted on an aircraft is known. The flight
recorder for an aircraft receives and records data of the speed,
acceleration, etc. of the aircraft body through wires from
hydraulic cylinders, the speed indicator, sensors, etc. in the
aircraft always while the aircraft is flying. The recording is
continued at least after the airplane has once taken off until it
has landed.Such a flight recorder is a very large scale apparatus which,
as stated above, needs data supplied from the hydraulic cylinders, 
speed indicator, sensors, etc. in the aircraft; there
are seen no examples where this is mounted on others
than aircrafts which are large means of
transportation.On the other hand, also in a traffic accident of
a means of transportation, such as a ship and a car,
other than an aircraft, it is very advantageous to
analyze data of, for example, acceleration, angular
velocity, etc. of the transportation means at the
accident occurrence time, in order to look into the
cause of the accident. However, because the flight
recorder is a very large scale apparatus, it is not
possible to apply this to other means of
transportation practically because of complex mounting
operation, costs, etc., although it is theoretically
possible.A traffic accident reproduction system for
reproducing a traffic accident of a vehicle during a
predetermined time period before and after a traffic
accident occurrence time, the traffic accident
reproduction system comprising:
acceleration measurement means for measuring
acceleration of the vehicle in three axial directions
in a three-dimensional space to output acceleration
data;storage means for storing the acceleration
data;
