<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing unit for waterless offset printing. The dynamics of the printing unit are to be improved and the build-up of printing ink on the rubber blanket is to be avoided. For this purpose, the form cylinder (5, 6, 43, 71) bears a sleeve-like printing form (67) and/or the transfer cylinder (3, 4, 72) bears a sleeve-like transfer form, and the printing and transfer form (67) can be slid onto or off the respective cylinder.

<CLAIMS>
Forme or transfer cylinder (43) of a printing unit
(1, 2) for waterless offset printing, which is mounted

in side walls (46, 47) and carries a sleeve (67),
wherein one end of the forme or transfer cylinder (43)

can be exposed from one side wall (46), producing an
aperture via which the sleeve (67) can be pushed onto

the forme or transfer cylinder (43), in the case of the
other side wall (47), beside which the drive (59) is

disposed, a line (52) for a coolant in the forme or
transfer cylinder (43) is connected to an outside line

(65) and extends through the forme or transfer cylinder
(43) to the other end of the forme or transfer cylinder

(43), and at this end is in connection by means of a
radial access (55) to a cooling chamber (53) through

which the coolant flows, cooling the surface (50) of
the forme or transfer cylinder (43), and which is

connected to a discharge line (66) by means of a
channel (57) leading through the drive-side journal

(45) out of the forme or transfer cylinder (43), and at
the end of the forme or transfer cylinder (43)

associated with the other side wall (47) compressed air
is conveyed via a connection. (60) through the forme or

transfer cylinder (43) via a line (54) to radial bores
(64) disposed at the other end of the cylinder beside

the side wall (46), by means of which bores the
compressed air flows out to expand the sleeve (67) to

be pushed on.
Forme or transfer cylinder (43) according to
claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the cooling chamber (53)
has spiral guide vanes determining the circulation of

the coolant.
