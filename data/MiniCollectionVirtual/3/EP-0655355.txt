<ABSTRACT>
A wheel suspension for an axle of a motor vehicle, in particular a McPherson rear axle has a transverse link (3) and a tie rod (4), the transverse link being secured to the wheel carrier (2) by means of a joint (1) and the body-side bearings (1a, b) of the transverse link and of the tie rod and of the connection bearing (5) being realized between the transverse link and tie rod with a defined identification for elastokinematic adjustment of the wheel under the effect of lateral and circumferential forces acting on the wheel. The transverse link with connected tie rod is arranged underneath a wheel drive shaft and, with respect to the direction of travel, in front of a tracking rod (8). The tie rod extends, viewed from above, obliquely forwards, the transverse link and the tracking rod being positively adjusted with respect to one another. They form a wheel steering pole (P) which lies outside the tread wheel gauge and behind the central transverse plane of the wheel. In front of the central transverse plane of the wheel and outside the longitudinal central plane of the wheel there is a penetration point (X) through an axis running through the wheel carrier-side joint of the transverse link and the body-side bearing of the McPherson shock absorber (13).
