<ABSTRACT>
Method of polishing a surface (5a) of a noble metal or an alloy 
comprising mainly noble metal, in which a polishing means is moved across the surface 

while exerting a polishing pressure for obtaining a plane and smooth polished surface 
without any defects. A composition comprising demineralised water with 20 to 40% by 

weight of an organic liquid comprising a poly-alcohol or a derivative thereof, for 
example, glycerol, and particles which can be encapsulated and have a Knoop's 

hardness of between 5 and 50 GPa, for example Al₂O₃ grains, is used as a polishing 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of polishing a surface of a noble metal or an
alloy comprising mainly noble metal, in which a polishing means and said surface are moved
with respect to each other while exerting a polishing pressure for obtaining a polished surface.It is generally known to polish platinum, gold or silver surfaces mechanically
by means of polishing grains. Although a satisfactory plainness can generally be achieved in
this way, the polished surface has many grooves and scratches when viewed microscopically.
Moreover, mechanical polishing causes material disturbances under the polished surface. A
Mechanically polished surface is unsuitable for many uses such as, for example direct
bonding. Moreover, in the manufacture of layered high-tech products, such a thin-film
magnetic heads, very plane and smooth polished surfaces without defects are required.It is an object of the invention to provide a method of polishing a surface of a
noble metal or an alloy comprising mainly noble metal, in which a polishing means is moved
across the surface to be polished while exerting a polishing pressure, with which method a
surface which is substantially plane, smooth and without defects can be obtained.To this end the method according to the invention is characterized as defined in
Claim 1.It has been found that use of the method according to the invention for noble
metals such as Pt, Au or Ag or mixed forms thereof, or alloys comprising mainly noble metals
such as silver-magnesium, platinum-tin, including possible intermetallic compounds such as
Ag3Mg, Au3Al2, Pt3Sn, which can be characterized as being relatively soft, yields substantially
plane polished surfaces without defects, in which surface roughnesses R (rms) of less than 2 nm
can be achieved. It is assumed that the organic liquid present in the indicated amount in the
polishing means functions as an encapsulating, suspending means for the particles which are 
present, so that the possibility of scratches is minimal in spite of the hardness of the small
particles.Grains having a grain size of the order of 50 nm are slightly larger than
microclusters. It has been found that the particles can be encapsulated and suspended
satisfactorily at said grain size so that, while maintaining the hardness, the possibility of
scratches is minimal.It has been found that Al2O3 particles having a Knoop's hardness of approximately
21 Gpa not only have a suitable hardness but are also eminently encapsulated and
suspended in the previously mentioned organic liquid.
