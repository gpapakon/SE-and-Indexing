<ABSTRACT>
This system of overhead transport consists essencially of a track 
with two rail-cables (2), horizontally placed, along which the 

motorised vehicles(1) run and are electrically powered. 
These cables are maintened statically parallel by cable-carrier 
shoes (5) attached to the ends of fixtures (21/28) hanging firmly 

from support arms (22) with support pillars (20) or from a third 
horizontalizing cable (25) supported in (24). 
The rail cables are drawn with hydraulic cylinders (51/55) from 
the pillars where a cable ends and another begins. To make the 

vehicle passing through them smoothly, the cable-carrier shoes 
begin in a slended way (50a) under every cable and go step by 

step widening and joining it until they form two horizontal 
planes (53) where the traction wheels (31) of the vehicle roll. 

This widening of the shoes also force the guide-arms (41) to open 
through the wheels (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
A transport system is known from EP-A-0 130 947 comprising a motorised vehicle 
suspended on rails mounted on cables. The invention proposes a system according to the features of claim 1 in order 
avoid using rails and power cables. This transport system consists of two parts: the track and the vehicle. The track 
consists of two horizontal rail-cables (2), along which the motorised vehicle (1) 
runs, is guided and powered. These cables are maintained statically parallel by 
cable-carrier shoes (5) attached to the ends of fixtures (21/28) hanging firmly 
from support arms (22) with support pillars (20), or from a third, horizontalizing 
cable (25) and arms (24). The vehicle is supported by traction wheels (31) attached directly to special 
electric engine shafts (30). The cabin is supported by the suspension (11) of the 
frames (3) grouping together the motors and guides (4). The centralizer arms (41) 
with guide wheels (43) have a system of springs and buffers that keep the unit 
centred, both on the rail-cables and as it passes through the cable-carrier 
shoes.

<CLAIMS>
Overhead transport system
, characterised 
by having a track composed of two static rail-cables (2), on which motorized 

vehicles (1) run, are guided and powered; such vehicles may be simple or made 
up of several units, like a train or articulated tube. 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
the above claim, characterised by the fact that the two rail-cables 

(2) are laid 
down horizontally, separated and maintained statically in space by lifting 

supports (21 oe 28), in the form of an inverted T, with cable-carrier 
shoes (5) 

incorporated on the two horizontal parts. 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
the previous claims, characterised by the fact that the fixtures (21 and 28) hang 

firmly from support arms (22) on support pillars (20) or another cable (25) which, 
supported by higher arms that also exist on the support pillars (24), by means of 

hangers (27), helps to keep the rail-cables horizontal in a similar way to 
suspension bridges. 
Overhead transport system
, according to the previous claims, characterised 
by the fact that the vehicle (1) has two or more drive assemblies (3), from which it 

hangs by means of shock-absorbing suspension (11) and swivels (12). 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
the previous claim, characterised by the fact that each drive assemly (3) consists, 

essentially, of a frame (32) containing guide units (4) and support and traction 
wheels (31), which are supported on the top of the rail-cables (2) and which 

receive their driving power through bushing by means of any conventional 
transmission system, or by being coupled directly to the shafts of high-torque, 

low-speed engines (30), which are attached to the aforesaid frame. 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
the previous claim, characterised by the fact that the guide units (4) are 

composed of two symmetrically equal centralizer arms (41) that revolve around 
axles (42) attached to the vertical edges of the frame (32c) and at the bottom 

have guide wheels (43), which run on the sides of the cables and make the 
centralizer arms open as they pass through the cable-carrier shoes (5); they 

maintain the cables centred in respect of the traction wheels (31) because the 
arms (41) have a device composed of two springs (44), a central buffer (45) and 

a central anchorage (46), in which the free end of both springs is fixed. Other  
 

buffers (47) and stretch restrictors inside the springs prevent the cable from 
coming out of the groove formed by the three wheels. 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
previous claims, characterised by the fact that the cable-carrier shoes (5) of the 

rail cables, have both ends pointed to make the opening an closing of the 
centralizer arms (41) smoother as they pass trough them. 
Overhead transport system
, according to 
previous claims, characterised by the fact that since the rail-cables 

are locked-coil 
cables and cannot be spliced, the rolling between one cable ending and 

another commencing is performed on special "coupling" shoes (5), which 
have a longitudinal opening at the bottom to allow both rail-cables, 

in a slight arc, 
to descend and cross in order to reach slack adjusters composed of hydraulic 

cylinders or any other element fulfilling this function, which are anchored 
beneath such shoes at the opposite end to the entrance of each cable and 

horizontally shifted a few centimetres in respect of the vertical of the centre of 
each shoe, each to the opposite side to avoid the rail-cables from rubbing when 

crossing. 
Overhead transport system
, according 
to previous claims, characterised by the fact that the cable-carrier 

shoes (5) 
incorporate longitudinal clamps which, set into a cutting made for this 

purpose, hold the rail-cables from above to prevent them from coming out of the 
compartment of such shoes in the event of vertical oscillations produced for any 

reason.
