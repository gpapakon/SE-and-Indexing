<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of bis(fluoromethyl)ether which comprises contacting formaldehyde with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of an essentially water-immiscible solvent for the ether. The bis(fluoromethyl)ether may be converted to difluoromethane, optionally after separation from the solvent, preferably by heating the bis(fluoromethyl)ether to elevated temperature in the presence of a metal, metal oxide, metal fluoride or metal oxyfluoride catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
PRODUCTION OF BIS(FLUOROMETHYL)ETHER AND DIFLUOROMETHANEThis invention relates to a process for the production of bis (fluoromethyl)ether by the reaction of formaldehyde with hydrogen fluoride and to a process for the production of difluoromethane incorporating the step of producing bis (fluoromethyl)ether from formaldehyde and hydrogen fluoride . Formaldehyde and hydrogen fluoride react together to produce equimolar amounts of bis (fluoromethyl )ether and water. The reaction is equilibrium limited, there being at best about a 552 conversion of formaldehyde to bis (fluoromethyl)ether at 20Â°C even when using a 7:1 molar excess of hydrogen fluoride to formaldehyde to drive the equilibrium towards the products. We have discovered that in order to overcome this equilibrium problem, one or both of the products may be removed from the reaction mixture as soon as possible after it/they are formed in order that the equilibrium may be driven towards the products.Bis (fluoromethyl )ether is useful as a starting material for the production of difluoromethane and methyl fluoride, for example by heating bis (fluoromethyl)ether to elevated temperature in the presence of a suitable catalyst. We have found that it is desirable that water is not present in significant amounts in the bis (fluoromethyl )ether which is heated since we have found that water promotes undesirable side reactions. Consequently it is desirable that water be removed from the water and bis (fluoromethyl )ether reaction product mixture before the bis (fluoromethyl)ether is further treated to produce difluoromethane and methyl fluoride. 

 We have now found that the aforementioned separation of bis (fluoromethyl)ether from water and separation of bis(fluoromethyl)ether product from the reaction mixture in which it is formed may be achieved efficiently using a "reactive extraction" process.According to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of bis( luoromethyl)ether which comprises contacting formaldehyde with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of an essentially water-immiscible solvent for the ether. The resulting solvent phase comprises more than an equimolar amount of bis ( luoromethyl)ether relative to water; this phase may then be separated from the aqueous phase. Preferably the solvent phase comprises at least twice as many moles, more preferably five times and especially ten times as many moles, of bis( luoromethyl)ether as water.By "reactive extraction" there is meant a process in which a product of an equilibrium
