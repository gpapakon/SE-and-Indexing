<ABSTRACT>
Cave plots are a graphical techniques for comparing two time series 
using overlapping and opposing coordinate systems. The plots are space-efficient, 

allowing comparisons involving many data points and can be used with irregularly-spaced 
time series.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of displaying data from multiple time 
series. Graphical displays serve a number of important functions. For example, 
graphical displays may record and store data compactly. Graphical displays are also 
strong and convenient tools for data analysis. Unlike numerical data analytic 
procedures (e.g. data reduction techniques), graphical display methods show data in 
a way that allows users to recognize general behavior, to study details and to find the 
unexpected. Additionally, graphical displays are relevant for effective data 
communication in presenting qualitative information to others. The importance of graphical display techniques in data analysis and 
communication is well recognized. In particular, aspects of graphical perception (the 
ability of the human eye-brain system to decode quantitative information from 
graphical displays, to summarize information and to focus on salient features) have 
been explored. See, e.g., John M. Chambers et al., Graphical Methods for DataAnalysis, Duxbury Press, Boston (1983); William S. Cleveland, The Elements of 
Graphing Data, Wadsworth Advanced Book Program, Monterey (1985); Edward R. 
Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Graphics Press, Cheshire, CT 
(1983); William S. Cleveland, Visualizing Data, Hobart Press, Summit, NJ (1993). 
Similarly, technological advances in the computer peripheral and printer industries 
as well as advances in computer languages have made graphical displays easier to 
generate. See, e.g., Richard A. Becker et al., The New S Language, Wadsworth & 
Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA (1988). Although the above references discuss some general graphical 
techniques and aspects of graphical perception, effective graphical display 
techniques are not yet available for many data situations. In particular, effective 
methods for comparing large amounts of data from multiple time series (i.e., data 
obtained as a function of time) in a space-efficient manner have proven difficult. 
Thus, there is a need for an effective method of graphically displaying time series 
data that permits individual values to be seen, highlights short-term fluctuations and 
is capable of showing large amounts of data in a relatively small amount of space.  In accordance with the present invention a graphical technique for 
presenting time series data using overlapping and opposing coordinate systems is 
disclosed. The resulting graphs, termed "cave plots," are easy to produce, readily 
understood and are capable

A method of displaying sets of data, said method comprising the steps 
of: 

   displaying a first coordinate system comprising a left vertical axis and a 
first horizontal axis, said first horizontal axis having a first endpoint and said first 

horizontal axis originating at said left vertical axis and extending to the right to said 
first endpoint, 

   displaying a second coordinate system comprising a right vertical axis 
and a second horizontal axis, said second horizontal axis having a second endpoint 

and said second horizontal axis originating at said second endpoint extending to the 
right to said right vertical axis, said second coordinate system being positioned 

relative to said first coordinate system such that said right vertical axis is parallel to 
and to the right of said left vertical axis and above said first horizontal axis, 

   scaling said first and second coordinate systems with values to 
accommodate values in said sets of data, wherein said left vertical axis is scaled from 

bottom to top, said right vertical axis is scaled from top to bottom, and said first and 
second horizontal axes are scaled such that values increase in the same direction, 

   displaying the data in a first one of said sets on said first coordinate 
system, and 

   displaying the data in a second one of said sets on said second 
coordinate system. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said sets of data are time series.

portion of the area bounded by said right and left vertical axes and by said first and 

second horizontal axes, said portion being defined as a function of an area of interest. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of displaying a first set of 
data and said step of displaying a second set of data use vertical line graphs. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said first set of data is displayed in a 
first color and said second set of data is displayed in a second color.

further positioned relative to said first coordinate system so as to form an overlap 

area. 
A method of displaying sets of data, said method comprising the steps

said second coordinate system comprises a right vertical axis and a second horizontal 
axis, said second horizontal axis having a second endpoint, said second horizontal
