<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inhaler,
according to the preamble of claim 1, for allowing
a patient to inhale powdered medicament from a capsule.Various forms of inhaler are already known, and it is
known to provide means for piercing the ends of a capsule in
order to allow the medicament to be withdrawn during inhalation.Extraction of the medicament may occur as a result of the
inhaled airstream passing over the capsule causing it to spin
by virtue of a vortical configuration of the airstream through
the inhaler. This spinning of the capsule assists ejection of
the powdered medicament within the tumbling capsule to enter
the inhaled airstream.The means for piercing the medicament capsule are known
to comprise pins which can be driven inwardly through the ends
of the capsule, thereby puncturing the capsule by virtue of
sharpened ends on the piercing pins. It is a disadvantage of
the known forms of capsule-piercing inhalers that misuse of
the inhaler, for example by a child, or accidental mis-use by
any patient may result in piercing of a human finger by
operation of the capsule piercing pins.Since it is customary to open the chamber of the device
to allow insertion of a fresh capsule, and since it is also
possible for the capsule-piercing pins to be effective inside
the chamber, in order to ensure that the pierced capsule
remains enclosed in the chamber between piercing and inhalation
agitation of the capsule, it is possible for there to be access
to the chamber, sufficient to allow a finger to enter the space
normally occupied by a capsule being pierced, hence leading to
injury.EP-A-0129985 discloses an inhaler using the medicament in
a blister pack which is placed in position on a discharge plate
while the inhaler housing is open, and then as the housing is
closed a spike on the inside of the cover pierces the blister
pack to discharge the contents into a space from which they can
be inhaled by the user. Closing the cover effects the spiking
action and a careless user could damage his or her fingers
during that closing action.EP-A-0303844 discloses an inhaler using elongate capsules 
carried by a rotating holder which in one position aligns the
ends of the capsule with piercing pins actuable by squeezing
the sides of the inhaler housing, and in another position
aligns the longitudinal axis of the thus pierced capsule, while
held stationary in the carrier, to allow inhalation air to pass
directly through the capsule from end to end. There is no free
chamber in which the capsule can rotate in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An inhaler (2) for inhaling powdered medicament
from capsules which are opened in the inhaler, comprising:-a

swirling chamber (S) having air inlets and able to hold a
capsule (C) from which the powdered medicament is extracted by

rotation of the opened capsule in the inhalation airflow
through the swirling chamber; means (30) in the swirling

chamber for piercing a capsule having been inserted in the
swirling chamber ready for inhalation; and a closure member

(22) movable between a first position (22) closing the swirling
chamber and a second position (22') providing access to the

swirling chamber for insertion of a capsule, characterized by
interlock means (38, 46, 48) responsive to positioning of the

closure member in said second position for inhibiting operation
of said capsule piercing means.
An inhaler according to claim 1, characterized in
that said capsule piercing means comprise at least one pin (30)

drivable for piercing the capsule to provide an opening through
which the powdered medicament can be released during swirling.
An inhaler according to claim 2, characterized in
that there are two of said pins (30) and they are mounted to

approach one another colinearly for piercing the domed ends of
an elongate capsule, and in that the swirling chamber includes

a recess (28) to support the said elongate capsule during
operation of said pins.
An inhaler according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said closure member (22) is

movable from said first position (22) to said second position
(22') by pivoting.
An inhaler according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that said interlock means (38, 46, 48) are

responsive to arrival of said closure member at said first
position (22) for liberating the capsule-piercing means for

operation while said closure member is in said first position,
and are effective to inhibit operation of said capsule-piercing

means (30), both in said second position (22') and in all
intermediate positions.
An inhaler according to claim 5, wherein said
closure member (22) is movable from said first position to said 

second position by pivoting, and characterized in that said
closure member comprises a pair of ears (48) each having an

aperture (46) for registration with a stud (38) of said
interlock means whereby said stud (38) is unable to move in the

direction corresponding to operation of said capsule-piercing
means until said holes (46) in the ears are in register with

said studs (38).
An inhaler according to claim 6, characterized in
that said ears (48) are flexible and each include a respective

pivot lug (52) for engagement with a pivot recess of the body
of the rest of the inhaler, whereby said ears may be deflected

either towards or away one another in order to permit entry of
said pivot lugs into said pivot recesses by deformation of the

ears during assembly of the inhaler, whereupon the ears then
spring back to their relaxed configurations to hold the closure

member connected to the rest of the inhaler body.
An inhaler according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the chamber (S) is non-circular and has

two opposed walls (S', 20) joined by at least one further wall
(26, 28) of non-circular shape, and is able to allow the

capsule to rotate freely about its transverse axis under the
influence of the inhaled airflow but otherwise to impact

against said at least one further wall in order to increase the
likelihood of ejection of the medicament from within the

capsule.
