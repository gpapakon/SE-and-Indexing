<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a player interface capable of communicating to the player at least one game information item and of receiving from the player at least one response information item, and selection means (14) which can select at least one game information item taken from a predetermined game information set. Time counting means contain an adjustable counting value corresponding to an elementary game duration, this counting value being initialised to an initial value on reception of a start-of-game indication. Processing means (11, 13) are capable, in the presence of the start-of-game indication,   a) of activating the selection means (14) and the time counting means after indication of the selected game information item, then of comparing, at the latest when the elementary game duration has elapsed, the game information item and response information item, b) of modifying the elementary game duration contained in the time counting means as a function of the result of the comparison and of predetermined time limits, and c) of automatically and cyclically repeating the steps a) and b) until an end-of-game indication has been received.

Electronic game device, which comprises: 

means of reception (10) of a start-of-game 
indication in the 
absence of which the device (1) is 
inactive, 
a player-interface (3) capable of informing the 
player of at least one game cue (8) and of receiving at 

least one response-cue (7) from the player, 
selection means (14), able to select at least one 
game cue picked out from a predetermined set of game 

cues, 
time counting means (132) able to contain an 
adjustable count value corresponding to an elementary 

game period, this count value being initialized to an 
initial value on reception of the said start-of-game 

indication, and characterized by 
processing means (11, 13), able, in the presence 
of the start-of-game indication, 


a) to activate the selection means (14), and the time 
counting means (132) after indication of the selected 

game cue, and then to compare, at the latest upon the 
expiry of the elementary game period, the game cue and 

the response-cue, 
b) to modify the elementary game period contained in 
the time counting means (132) on the basis of the result 

(INC, DEC) of the comparison and of predetermined time 
limits, and 
c) automatically and cyclically to repeat steps a) and 
b) until reception of an end-of-game indication, so as 

automatically to modulate some at least of the successive 
elementary game periods on the basis of the responses  

 
from the player. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it includes means (117, 118, 120) for automatic 

generation of the end-of-game indication (SP2) after an 
absence of response from the player for a predetermined 

number of consecutive cycles. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it comprises at least one independent medium (5) 

which includes first predetermined areas (8) in which the 
game cues are situated, as well as second predetermined 

areas (7) in which the corresponding response-cues are 
situated, 


in that the medium (5) includes first link means 
(6) capable of cooperating in a removable manner with 

second link means (4) situated on the player-interface 
(3), 
in that the player-interface includes indication 
means (4) respectively associated with the various first 

areas of the medium (8), the selection means (14) being 
able to activate one at least of the indication means (4) 

in a predetermined manner so as to indicate to the player 
which one of the game cues has been selected, 
in that the player-interface includes operating 
keys (BP1-BP6) on some at least of which are intended to 

rest the second areas of the medium (7), 
in that each operating key is linked to an 
indication means, the first and second areas of the 

medium being laid out in accordance with a correspondence 
which is the counterpart of that existing between the 

operating keys and the indication means. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the first link means include orifices (6) associated 

with the various first areas of the medium (8), in that 
the indication means (4) include luminous means standing 

proud of the player-interface and form the second link 
means capable of cooperating with the orifices of the 

medium, and in that the selection means (14) are able to 
maintain one at least of the luminous means activated for 

the said elementary game period so as to indicate the  
 

selected game cue. 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that it includes a number of operating keys (BP1, BP7) 

which is greater than the number of indication means (4), 

in that some keys (BP1, BP7) are linked together 
to form overall a number of groups of operating keys 

which is equal to the number of indication means and in 
that each second area of each medium corresponding to a 

group of operating keys is arranged on the said medium so 
as to cover the one or the other or all of the operating 

keys of the group. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the processing means include 

bistable elements (BS1-BS6) such as D-type latch 
memories, input-linked to the various operating means 

(BP1-BP6), each bistable element being output-linked to 
a first input of a comparator (CP1-CP6) whose other input 

is connected to an indication means (LD1-LD6), the 
outputs of the comparators being linked to logic means 

(110, 111, 113) capable of delivering an incrementation 
control signal (INC) or decrementation control signal 

(DEC) for the time counting means (132) on the basis of 
the values of the output signals from the comparators 

(CP1-CP6). 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the logic means (110) are also connected to the 

output of the bistable elements (BS1-BS6) so as to 
deliver the incrementation control signal (INC) should 

several keys be operated during the elementary game 
period. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the means of automatic generation 

of the end-of-game indication include a logic means of 
the AND gate type (117), linked to the output of the 

bistable elements (BS1-BS6), followed by another bistable 
element (118) whose two mutually complemented outputs are 

linked to an auxiliary counter (120) delivering an off 
signal (SP2) to the means of supply (12) of the device 

when the said predetermined number of consecutive cycles  
 

is reached. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 8,

Device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the selection means include a shift 

register (14) activated on reception of the start-of-game 
indication and at the end of each elementary game period 

defined by the time counting means (132) for a 
predetermined selection period, on completion of which 

the time counting means (132) is activated.
