<DESCRIPTION>
 Bis-(substituted-phenyl) Derivatives with Cytotoxic and Anticancer Activity.The present invention relates to novel polybenzamide mustards having anticancer and hypoxia-selective properties, to methods of preparing the novel compounds, and to the use of these compounds as anticancer agents.Background of the InventionAlkylating agents are an important class of anticancer drugs, which express their cytotoxic and antitumour effects by forming adducts with cellular DNA.Bifunctional nitrogen mustard alkylating agents such as chlorambucil, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide are a major subset of this class of drugs. Their mechanism of antitumour action has been shown to be via interstrand cross-linking of cellular DNA, primarily at guanine N7 sites in runs of guanines in the major groove, which are both the most accessible and the most nucleophilic DNA sites. Because the two alkylating functions on the nitrogen mustard are in such close proximity, cross-linking is limited to DNA sequences which contain two reactive nucleophilic centers within reach of the mustard, with most of the interstrand cross-links being between proximate guanines. Due partly to these spatial restraints, a large proportion of the molecules alkylate DNA only once, forming monoadducts which are primarily genotoxic rather than cytotoxic. A major mechanism of cellular resistance to nitrogen mustards is increased DNA repair of the cross- links which are formed.There has been less work on compounds designed to alkylate in the minor groove of DNA, where the most susceptible sites are the N3 of adenine and the exocyclic amino group 

of guanine, which are the sites targeted respectively by the two best known minor groove alkylating agents CC-1065 (Hurley et al. , 1988) and anthramycin (Hurley & Needham- VanDevanter, 1986) . These compounds are extraordinarily- potent cytotoxins, in spite of forming only monoadducts, possibly because they do not readily induce DNA repair enzymes (Tang et al . , 1988). There is also recent evidence, using transcription termination assays with linearized plasmid DNA containing the 420 base pair Pst 1 fragment of exon 2 of the human c-myc oncogene, that two nitrogen mustards (chlorambucil and melphalan) cause termination of transcription preferentially at adenines (at every adenine pair in the melphalan-treated template, and at selected A- G and GA pairs in the chlorambucil-treated template) , in spite of the fact that most of the alkylation by these compounds occurs at guanines (Pieper et al . , 1989).For these
