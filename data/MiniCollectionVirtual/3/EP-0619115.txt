<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of administration 
of drugs. More specifically, the invention concerns 
topical administration of preset doses of drugs useful 
for treating skin disorders and for wound healing. A preferred method of applying drugs used to treat 
skin disorders and wounds is topical application. This 
method avoids possible side effects often associated 
with drugs administered orally or by injection. Oral 
administration and injection result in exposure of many 
bodily tissues to the drug, while topical or local 
administration exposes essentially only the tissues to 
which the drug is applied. Methods available for topical or local application 
of drugs include the use of creams, gels, liquid 
solutions, and sprays, or the implantation of strips 
containing medication (in the case of surgical 
wounds/incisions). While these methods are adequate in 
many cases, they are each limited in their usefulness. Application of a gel or cream to the affected area 
of skin requires touching the skin, which may further 
irritate the skin and/or introduce dirt or pathogens to 
the skin. In addition, delivery of a uniform and 
precise dose of the drug can be difficult. A liquid formulation may run off of the targeted 
area of skin unless it is absorbed quickly and/or the 
skin is held in a proper position until the liquid is 
fully absorbed. Thus, delivery of a precise dose of the 
drug to the target area can be difficult using this 
method.  Implantation of medicated strips into surgical 
incisions is not a favored method of application of a 
drug for wound healing, as this method involves placing 
a foreign object into the wound. The object may become 
displaced, or may cause an infection. Application of a spray solution to the affected 
area of skin prevents the need to touch the skin. 
However, unless the spray dries rapidly or is absorbed 
quickly by the skin, the solution may run off the 
targeted area of skin, thereby decreasing the dose of 
the drug actually delivered to the skin. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a protein 
produced naturally in many mammals including humans. 
Among other biological activities, PDGF appears to 
stimulate healing and tissue repair of various types of 
dermal and surgical wounds when administered at 
appropriate concentrations, usually about 0.5-5.0 µg/cm²

[1985]; Robson et al., The Lancet, 339:23-25 [1992];

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container comprising a metered dose valve and microparticles 
of a drug for topical treatment of skin disorders. 
The container of claim 1 wherein the drug 
possesses human PDGF-like activity. 
The container of claim 2 wherein the drug is 
human recombinant PDGF-BB. 
The container of claim 2 or 3 further comprising an 
excipient selected from the group consisting of: 

collagen, gelatin, and carbohydrate. 
The container of claim 4 wherein the excipient 
is hydrolyzed gelatin with an average molecular weight 

of about 20,000 daltons. 
The container of claim 5 further comprising a 
propellant and a lubricant. 
The container of claim 5 that comprises 
isobutane, isopropyl myristate, and human recombinant 

PDGF-BB-hydrolyzed gelatin microparticles, wherein the 
hydrolyzed gelatin has an average molecular weight of 

about 20,000 daltons. 
A method of preparing a device to deliver a 
preset dose of a drug comprising: 


(a) preparing microparticles comprising a drug used 
to treat a skin disorder; 
(b) packaging the microparticles in a container; 
(c) sealing the container with a metered dose 
valve; and 
(d) adding propellant to the container. 
The method of claim 8 wherein the drug has 
PDGF-like activity. 
The method of claim 9 wherein the drug is 
human recombinant PDGF-BB. 
The method of claim 10 wherein the 
microparticles comprise human recombinant PDGF-BB and 

hydrolyzed gelatin with an average molecular weight of 
20,000 daltons. 
The method of claim 11 further comprising 
adding a propellant and a lubricant to the container. 
The method of claim 12 wherein the propellant 
is isobutane and the lubricant is isopropyl myristate.
