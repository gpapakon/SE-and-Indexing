<ABSTRACT>
With reference to Figure 1, a filamentary member in the form of 
flexible tubing 1 is provided with longitudinal stiffening comprising 

a helical reinforcement rib 2 wound over the external surface 3 of 
the tubing 1 and anchored to the surface 3 at longitudinally spaced 

intervals, each of which extends between anchor points A, E, are at 
the extremities of one complete turn of a helical winding. The rib 2 

is free to move, relative to the external surface 3, except at anchor 
points A, E. 
Winding of the rib 2 takes places around the central axis 4 of the 
tubing 1. 
Should bending of the tubing 1 take place, around a winding drum, 
(not shown), as indicated by arrow 5, the net increase in the rib 

path length ABC on the tube surface 3 on the outside of the bend is 
equal to the reduction in the rib path length CDE on the inside of 

the bend. Consequently, the rib path length ABCDE is the same in 
both the bent and unbent conditions of the tubing 1. 
With reference to Figure 2, in the bent condition, mid-point C of the 
rib winding is displaced relative to mid-point C₁ on the surface 3 of 

the tubing 1, by distance 6. Similarly, but by small amounts 7 and 
8, points B and D on the rib winding are displaced relative to points 

B₁ and D₁ on the surface 3. 
In the situation illustrated by Figure 2, the external surface 3 of 
the tubing 1 is strained due to bending. However, longitudinal 

strain in the stiffening rib 2 is substantially zero everywhere, 
regardless of the radius of the bend or tubing diameter.  
In order to substantially prevent the tubing 1 from twisting under 
longitudinal loads, a second helically wound reinforcement rib may be 

provided, wound in the opposite direction to rib 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filamentary members, and is primarily, but 
not exclusively, concerned with filamentary members of tubular form, 
hereinafter "tubing". Offshore oil and gas rigs make use of steel tubing wound on drums, 
and disposed in vertically extending boreholes. The drums are of small (less than 2.0 m) diameter in order to reduce 
the overall size of a winding unit when the tubing thereof is wound 
up. Combined requirements for high longitudinal strength and 
stiffness coupled with the need to wind tubing on small diameter 
drums create a problem. As tubing bending loads are substantial, only a limited number of 
winding and unwinding operations is possible due to fatigue damage 
caused by bending the tubing past their yield points. It is an object of the present invention to at least alleviate these 
problems. According to the present invention, a filamentary member, (such as 
tubing) is provided with longitudinal stiffening comprising at least 
one helical reinforcement rib wound over the external surface of the 
member and anchored to said surface at longitudinally spaced 
intervals. Preferably at least one more helical reinforcement ribs may be wound 
over the external surface of the filamentary member, in a direction 
opposite to the winding of the first-mentioned rib, and anchored to 
said first-mentioned rib at longitudinally spaced intervals. A plurality of ribs may be provided, some of which may be 
contiguously disposed.  The filamentary member may be of composite form. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of 
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:- 
Figures 1 to 4 are fragmentary side views of tubing which illustrate 
the principle of the invention; and Figure 5 is a fragmentary side view in perspective of a preferred 
form of the invention. Figure 1 shows a filamentary member in the form of flexible tubing 1 
provided with longitudinal stiffening comprising a helical 
reinforcement rib 2 wound over the external surface 3 of the tubing 1 
and anchored to the surface 3 at longitudinally spaced intervals, 
each of which extends between anchor points A, E. The anchor points A, E, are at the extremities of one complete turn 
of a helical winding. The rib 2 is free to move, relative to the 
external surface 3, except at anchor points A, E. Winding of the rib 2 takes places around the central axis 4 of the 
tubing 1. When bending of the tubing 1 takes place, around a winding drum, (not 
shown), and as indicated by arrow 5, the net
