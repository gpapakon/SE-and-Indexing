<ABSTRACT>
In the method, the article is prepared on a carriage, the distance a between the warp stop motion and the last heald frame being set, and is put into store. Insertion of the article into a weaving machine takes place with the set distance a being maintained. The device comprises a carriage (1) with an apparatus (21) for setting the distance a appropriate for weaving and appropriate to the article and an auxiliary subassembly with a receiving apparatus (27) for the warp stop motion (12) and with a receiving apparatus (40) for the heald frames (13), in order to insert the article into a weaving machine at the distance appropriate for weaving and appropriate to the article.

A process for changing a fabric prepared for production
on a loom, wherein the fabric with the warp beam, the

reed, the warp stop motion and the drawn-in warp threads
is disposed, whilst retaining a spacing a which is

appropriate for weaving and for the fabric, between the
warp stop motion and the heald frames on a movable

assembly and is inserted therefrom into the loom,
characterised in that
 the fabric is removed from the
assembly by means of an auxiliary assembly and is

inserted into the loom or removed from the loom
respectively and is disposed on the assembly in order to

place the fabric in readiness for the purpose of relaying
with a finished warp beam or to lay it on supports for

the purpose of reuse with a partially finished warp beam.
A process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 in the course of the adjustment
appropriate for weaving and the fabric the warp threads

are straightened.
A process according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the spacing between the warp stop
motion and the last heald frame is adjusted.
A device for performing the process according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, with the mobile assembly (1), on which the

fabric is disposed, with the spacing a appropriate for
weaving and the fabric, between the warp stop motion (12)

and heald frames (13),
characterised in that
 a movable auxiliary assembly (31)
is provided in order to remove the warp beam (11) and

also the warp stop motion (12) and heald frames (13),
which are positioned with the spacing a appropriate for

weaving and the fabric, from the assembly, whilst 
maintaining the spacing, and to insert them into a loom

(39) and remove them from the loom and to dispose them on
the assembly.
A device according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 two devices (40) are provided to
house the h
eald frames (13) in an arrangement appropriate
for the loom, which are disposed on the auxiliary

assembly (31) spaced from one another and are intended to
come into engagement with members (50) of the heald

frames (13) in the loom (39) which have guides (51) in
order to introduce the heald frames.
A device according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 each housing device (40) comprises
two centring members (52, 53), which can be brought into

engagement with the guide member (50) of the heald frames
(13) in order to align the housing device (40).
A device according to Claim 4, wherein the movable
assembly (1) comprises two rests (3) with supports for

the warp stop motion (12) and two retention devices (4)
for heald frames (13),
characterised in that
 an adjustment mechanism (21) is
associated with each rest (3),

and in that the support is displaceable in relation to
the retention device (4).
A device according to one of Claims 4 or 7,
characterised in that
 a clamping device (17) for the warp
threads (15) is disposed in the warp direction in front

of the retention device (4),

and in that the adjustment mechanism (21) comprises a bar
(24), over which the warp threads are passed and which is

intended to keep the warp threads stretched and
straightened during the adjustment of the spacing a.
