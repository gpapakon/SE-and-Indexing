<CLAIMS>
Stabilized conductive pigment based on aluminium-doped 
zinc oxide, characterized in that it contains an 

alkaline earth metal titanate to stabilize the electric 
conductivity. 
Pigment according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the alkaline earth metal titanate is magnesium 

titanate, calcium titanate, strontium titanate or barium 
titanate. 
Process for preparing a stabilized conductive 
pigment according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in 

that the salts of zinc, aluminium, an alkaline earth 
metal and titanium are metered, either jointly or 

separately, together with a hydrogen peroxide solution, 
continuously and at a predetermined mixing ratio to the 

aqueous reaction medium, which may contain a suspension 

of a support, at a pH of 7 to 12, preferably 7 to 9, and 
a temperature ranging from 40 to 90째C, preferably from 60 

to 80째C, in such a manner that in each case hydrolysis of 
the metal salts and precipitation of the hydroxides or 

hydrated oxides or, in the case where a support is used, 
deposition on the support take place immediately, the 

pigment is separated off, washed and dried and calcined 
at temperatures of 500 to 900째C, preferably 550 to 650째C, 

in a reducing inert gas atmosphere, preferably in a 
nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere, for 30 to 60 minutes. 
Use of the pigment according to Claims 1 and 2 
for pigmenting varnishes, printing ink, plastics or 

coatings.
