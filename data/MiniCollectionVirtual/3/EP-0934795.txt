<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method for repairing a protectively coated, locally damaged
turbomachinery vane without removing the vane from its parent turbomachinery module.

The method includes applying a diffusible coating precursor to the damaged region of the
vane and diffusing the coating precursor into the vane in the presence of a nonreactive

atmosphere. The nonreactive atmosphere is confined to a chamber that contains the
damaged vane, the chamber being bounded in part by the turbomachinery module itself.

A conventional stress relief machine is used to heat only the damaged region of the vane
to a temperature sufficient to promote diffusion of the precursor into the vane. The

method uses equipment and supplies that are routinely available or easily fabricated from
common, inexpensive materials. Use of the method avoids the expense and delay of

removing the vane from its parent module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the repair of localized damage to turbomachinery
components and in particular to an in-situ method of repairing localized damage to
turbomachinery blades and vanes.Turbomachines such as gas turbine engines have one or more turbine modules
each of which includes a plurality of blades and vanes for exchanging energy with a
working medium fluid. Because the blades and vanes of a turbine module operate in a
hostile, high temperature environment, they are typically made of a high strength,
temperature tolerant substrate material and coated with a damage resistant protective
coating. Despite the presence of the protective coating, the blades and vanes are
nevertheless susceptible to localized burning, cracking, erosion, sulfidation, oxidation and
other types of damage. The damage may be confined to the coating, or may breach the
coating and extend into the substrate.When it is necessary to repair a locally damaged component, such as a blade or
vane, it is common practice to first remove the damaged component from the turbine
module. The damaged component is repaired by first abrading away the locally damaged
material and applying a coating precursor to the abraded region. The component is then
placed in a diffusion furnace and the furnace is flooded with a nonreactive gas such as
argon. The component is heated to a predefined temperature for a predetermined time so
that the coating precursor diffuses into the component. The repaired component is
subsequently reinstalled in the turbine module and the module is returned to service. Such a method is disclosed in documents,
US-A-4009 146, US-A-5 674 610 and
US-A-4004047.Although the above described repair procedure is highly effective, the preliminary
step of removing the damaged component from its parent module often entails substantial
disassembly of the module, making the repair inordinately time consuming and
expensive. Nevertheless, module disassembly and component removal is a widely
accepted practice because an entire turbine module is far too large to fit into most
commercially available diffusion furnaces. Even if a large enough furnace were 
available, the sheer weight and bulk of a turbine module would complicate the task of
moving the module into and out of the furnace.The expense and delay of module disassembly may be avoided by conducting an
in-situ repair of localized damage to turbine blades and vanes. In-situ repair is feasible
when the damaged component is reasonably accessible to a repair technician without
removing

<CLAIMS>
A method for repairing a coated turbomachinery component (16) disposed radially
between an outer case (26) and an inner drum (18) of a turbomachinery module (10), the

method comprising:

applying a diffusible coating precursor to a locally damaged region (42) of
the component;

and 
characterized by
 the steps of

constructing a chamber (56) bounded in part by at least one of the outer
case (26) and the inner drum (18) so that at least the damaged region (42) is

contained within the chamber (56);
introducing a nonreactive atmosphere into the chamber (56); and
diffusing the coating precursor into the component (16) in the presence of
the nonreactive atmosphere.
The method of claim 1 wherein an annulus extends axially through the module
(10) from an inlet end (60) to a discharge end (62), and the step of forming the chamber

(56) comprises blocking the inlet and discharge ends (60, 62) of the annulus to impede
undesirable fluid leakage out of the chamber (56).
The method of claim 2 wherein the step of blocking the inlet and discharge ends
(60, 62) comprises secur
ing at least one arcuate panel (58) to each of the ends (60, 62)
and optionally installing a viewing cover (76) in the vicinity of the damaged component

(16).
The method of any preceding claim wherein the chamber (56) is vented and the
nonreactive atmosphere is continually replenished.
The method of claim 4 wherein the nonreactive atmosphere is replenished by
directing a stream of nonreactive gas over the damaged region (42) of the component

(16) during the step of diffusing the coating precursor. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the coating precursor is in the form of
a slurry.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the nonreactive atmosphere
comprises argon gas.

The method of claim 8 wherein the fluid reaction element (16) is a stator vane.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the step of diffusing the coating
precursor comprises locally heating the component, in the vicinity of the damaged region

(42), to a predefined temperature, maintaining the damaged region (42) at the predefined
temperature for a predetermined time interval and, after expiration of the time interval,

reducing the temperature to a target temperature gradually enough to prevent cracking of
the diffused coating.
The method of claim 10 wherein a heating coil (46) is used to locally heat the

coating selected from the class of aluminide coatings and the coating precursor comprises
aluminum.

coating selected from the class of aluminide coatings, the coating precursor comprises 
aluminum, the predefined temperature is between about 860 and 885°C (1575 and 1625

degrees Fahrenheit), the predetermined time interval is approximately two hours, the

every ten minutes, and the target temperature is approximately 315°C (600 degrees
Fahrenheit).
