<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF CIS-OR TRANSUROCAMIC ACID FOR THE TREATMENT OF PHOTODERMATOSES AND IMMUNOGENIC SKIN DISEASESDESCRIPTIONThe present invention relates to compounds of general formula I : -Q-R-X ( I )wherein Q is a substituted or unsubstituted furanyl, imidazolyl, pyrrolyl or thiopheneyl group, R is CR12-CR22, (cis)CR1 = CR2, or (trans)CR:=CR2, X is COOR3 or NR^, and R-R4 are each, independently, H, or an alkyl or an aryl group and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds in the topical treatment of skin conditions considered to involve an over-active immune response, or which are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.Trans-urocanic acid (UCA) is a naturally occurring compound found in the upper layers of the epidermis, where it is synthesized through deamination of histidine by histidase. When the skin is irradiated with ultraviolet light, up to 60 or 70% of the trans-UCA present is converted into the cis-iso er and it is thought that 

 cis-UCA, once so generated, functions as a mediator in both systemic and local UV induced immune system suppression. See the review article by M. Norval et al. in Photochemistry and Photobiology Vol . 50. No. 2, pp 267- 275, 1989 (1).Support for the proposition that cis-UCA is a mediator in UV induced suppression of the immune system is provided by the work reported by M. Norval et al . in Photochemistry and Photobiology Vol. 49. No. 5, pp 633-639, 1989 and that of V.E. Reeve et al., reported in Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photoreed 1991: 8: pp 176 - 180. The former authors found that cis-UCA was able to induce suppression of normal delayed type hypersensitivity response to herepes simplex virus type 1 in mice and the latter found that cis-UCA, generated by applying trans-UCA (in a cosmetic cream) to urine skin and then irradiating the treated skin, systemically suppressed normal contact hyper- sensitivity. Reeve et al. suggested that this activity is potentially harmful, since it could result in tumour development and, therefore, concluded that urocanic acid was potentially hazardous and should not be used as a cosmetic ingredient. Indeed, Reeve et al., in Photochemistry and Photobiology Vol . 49. No. 4. pp 459- 464. 1989., reported that topically applied trans-UCA 

 significantly increased the tumour load induced in hairless mice, on exposure to Erythema inducing doses of UV light or sunlight.Thus, rather than being confirmed as therapeutically useful, investigation of their metabolic roles has led to the removal
