<ABSTRACT>
An optical inspection system for observing physical 
defects in an article of manufacture (16) such as a solar 

cell. The system includes a source of collimated light (18) 
and a filter (22) disposed in the path of the collimated 

light beam for passing specific wavelengths. A diffuser 
(24) is disposed in the path of the light beam for diffusing 

the specific wavelengths of the filtered light and for 
directing it onto the article. An observation device (12) 

such as a video camera is directed at the article of 
manufacture such that it provides an image of the article of 

manufacture as illuminated by the coherent and diffused 
light which image reveals physical defects in the article of 

manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical systems for
inspecting multi-layer silicon devices, and more
particularly to an optical system employing near infrared
illumination to detect defects in silicon layers.Inspection systems are available in the art for
detecting defects such as cracks in silicon layers,
particularly in silicon layers or wafers employed in solar
cells. Such systems include a source of linearly polarized
infrared illumination which is directed entirely onto the
solar cell device at a first selected angle. The linearly
polarized infrared illumination is reflected from the
silicon layer of the solar cell and an infrared video camera
is positioned at a second selected angle with respect to the
solar cell. The video camera, which includes an infrared
linear polarization analyzer, provides a visual image of the
silicon layer and cracks in the silicon wafer surface can be
observed.A typical infrared solar cell inspection system is
described in the publication by J.R. Hodor, H.J. Decker,
Jr., J. Barney, "Infrared Technology Comes to State-of-the-Art 
Solar Array Production", SPIE Vol. 819, Infrared
Technology XIII (1987), pp. 22-29.The systems previously known in the art employ infrared
illumination in the 5 to 15 micrometre range, and also aim
the collimated, linearly polarized infrared illumination
directly onto the solar cell. Such systems result in an
image on the video camera screen in which cracks in the
silicon layer can be observed.Available inspection methods, known in the art are
extremely complex in design and use, and hindered by large
weight constraints. All of the various systems known or
proposed to date may no longer be considered practical since
the complexity, size and weight constraints of the systems
make them too expensive and not portable enough for use in
a dynamic aerospace manufacturing and test environment.FR-A-2,641,866 discloses an inspection process for
transparent protective windows covering several solar cells
in which a cold light beam is directed onto a section of
each of the windows while observing the windows under a
roughly normal angle of incidence to search inside the
periphery for a zone of high brilliance characteristic of a
defect in the window. US-A-4,501,966 discloses an apparatus
and system for inspecting infra-red transparents such as an
array of photovoltaic modules containing silicon solar
cells. The system includes an infra-red microscope and a
number of sources of infra-red light.The present invention seeks to provide an optical
inspection
