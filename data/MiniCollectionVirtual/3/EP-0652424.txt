<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steering torque sensor for detecting the effective steering torque in the input shaft (1) of a motor vehicle steering gear. The steering torque sensor essentially comprises a first component (2) which can be pushed coaxially onto the free end (10) of the input shaft (1) and can be connected to the latter in a torque-transmitting manner, having a first flag-like extension (6) pointing away approximately radially from its common axis of rotation (3) with the input shaft (1), as well as a second component (4) which is coaxial with the first component (2) and encloses the latter at least partially concentrically, and which has two second flag-like extensions (7) which are approximately parallel, likewise point away approximately radially from the common axis of rotation (3) and accommodate the first extension (6) between themselves. Between the first extension (6) and the neighbouring two second extensions (7) there are arranged in each case without play pressure sensors (8), preferably in the form of low-resistance force-dependent electric resistors. The second component (4) can, on the one hand, be connected in a torque-transmitting manner to a steering shaft (9) which can be actuated by the steering wheel of the motor vehicle and, on the other hand, can be coupled to the first component (2) in a torque-transmitting manner via a twistable rotary rod (5) - or a spring device which is comparable thereto, so that in each case a steering-torque-dependent pressure force is exerted on one or the other pressure sensor (8), as soon as steering torques become effective in the course of the steering shaft/input shaft arrangement (9/1).

Steering torque sensor for the purpose of detecting the
effective steering torque on the input shaft (1) of a motor

vehicle steering gear, containing

a first component (2), which can be attached in a coaxial
manner to the free end (10) of the input shaft (1) and

first component (2) has an at least approximately bell or cup

shape and its first extension (6) is disposed in its cup edge
region on the steering gear side, and that its steering shaft-side

bell or cup region (20) in the proximity of the base
comprises a circular cylindrical outer contour which serves as

a sliding bearing guide for the second component (4).
Steering torque sensor according to claim 2, wherein the
