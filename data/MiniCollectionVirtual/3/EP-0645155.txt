<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a holder for use in 
combination with a pre-filled cartridge-needle unit, the 

holder comprising a hollow body (36) sized for housing the 
cartridge-needle unit therein having proximal and distal 

ends; means (32,34) for permitting the body (36) to move 
axially relative to the cartridge-needle unit and for 

retaining the cartridge-needle unit within the holder; 
wherein the distal end of the body (36) is elliptical in 

cross-section and the proximal end of the body (36) is 
circular in cross-section. In another preferred 

embodiment, the body comprises a pair of cam slots (39) at 
the distal end and a pair or retaining sl
ots (37) at the 
proximal end, the slots (39,37) being sized to accept a 

circumferential ring (32) on the cartridge-needle unit and 
positioned to hold the cartridge-needle units in use and 

safe positions. The holder is easier to use and 
manufacture and reduces the susceptibility of health care 

workers to accidental needle strikes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a holder for pre-filled 
cartridge-needle units. Disposable medicament-containing cartridge needle 
units for use in conjunction with reusable hypodermic 
syringe holders are well known in the art and in 
widespread commercial use. Such cartridges 
conventionally feature a cylindrical body closed at the 
proximal end with a flexible plunger slidable within the 
bore of the cartridge and closed at the distal necked-down 
end with a septum secured to the cartridge by a 
crimped-on aluminum collar. The necked-down distal end 
conventionally is fitted with a needle hub/needle/needle 
guard assembly. Such cartridge-needle units are 
available from Sanofi Winthrop Pharmaceuticals under the 
Carpuject® trademark. In use, the cartridge-needle unit must be 
activated, i.e. the proximal end of the needle cannula 
must penetrate the sealed septum such that communication 
is achieved between the fluid and the proximal end of 
the needle. Some cartridge-needle units are sold in an 
activated form. Others must be activated by the user. 
When user-activated cartridge-needle units are used in 
conjunction with conventional reusable syringe holders 
of the type described, e.g. in Hadtke, U.S. Patent 
4,585,445 and in EP-A-0 485,028, this is accomplished 
when the health care worker advances the cartridge 
through the holder by rotating a clamping element. Many holders, including the above-referenced 
reusable holders, enable the user to avoid handling the 
cartridge-needle unit when the needle unit is exposed. 
Nevertheless, health care workers are especially  
 
susceptible to accidental and potentially infectious, 
and indeed, on occasion, possibly fatal, needle strikes 
due to the careless handling and/or disposing of the 
cartridge-needle unit after use. The consequences to 
health care workers of strikes from needles contaminated 
with various infectious diseases such as hepatitis or 
AIDS can be particularly severe. The frequency of such 
accidental needle strikes in the United States is 
surprisingly great, and has been estimated to be 
approximately one million strikes per year. Moreover, 
the cost to health care organizations for the testing of 
health care workers accidentally stricken by used 
needles is a significant burden on health care costs. 
Therefore, it would be desirable to further protect 
health care workers by providing systems which reduce 
the possibility of accidental needle strikes. To this end, it has been suggested to provide a 
hollow body to house the

<CLAIMS>
A holder for use in combination with a pre-filled 
cartridge-needle unit, said holder comprising: 

   a hollow body (36) sized for housing the 
cartridge-needle unit therein having proximal and distal 

ends; and 
   means (32,34) for permitting the body (36) to move 

axially relative to the cartridge-needle unit and for 
retaining the cartridge-needle unit within the holder; 

   characterized in that the distal end of said 
body (36) is elliptical in cross-section and the 

proximal end of said body (36) is circular in 
cross-section. 
A holder as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
body (36) comprises a first pair of retaining slots (35) 

at the distal end thereof and a second pair of retaining 
slots (37) at the proximal end thereof, said 

slots (35,37) being sized to accept a circumferential 
ring (32) of said cartridge-needle unit and positioned 

to hold said cartridge-needle unit in use and safe 
positions. 
A holder as claimed in either of the preceding 
claims wherein the distal end of said body (36) is 

squeezably deformable. 
A holder as claimed in claim 3 wherein said 

body (36) comprises a pair of squeeze pads (41) disposed 
on the distal end thereof. 
A holder as claimed in claim 2 wherein said 
first pair of retaining slots (35) are cam slots (39). 
A holder as claimed in claim 5 wherein said 
cam slots (39) are triangular in shape. 
A holder as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims further comprising retraction finger 

guards (60). 
A holder for use in combination with a pre-filled 
cartridge-needle unit having a circumferential 

ring (32), said holder comprising: 
   a hollow body (36) sized for housing the 

cartridge-needle unit therein; and 
   means (32,34) for permitting the body (36) to move 

axially relative to the cartridge-needle unit and for 
retaining the cartridge-needle unit within the holder; 

   characterized in that said body (36) comprises a 
pair of cam slots (39) at the distal end thereof and a 

pair of retaining slots (37) at the proximal end
