<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions 
containing vinyl ether functional silicones and to their 
preparation and to their use. Silicone vinyl ethers are 
curable by addition of photocleavable acids and exposure to 
ultraviolet or electron beam radiation. Alkenyl ether functional organosilicon compounds 
have been described in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,617,238 discloses a photopolymerizable composition 
wherein only one vinyl ether group for each SiH group can be 
incorporated into the siloxane molecule at any given time. Other alkenyloxy functional organosilicon compounds 
are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,707,503; 5,057,549; 
5,039,176 and EP Patent No. 0 462 389. The methods of these documents rely on competition 
between the vinyl ether group and other alkenyl groups within 
the same compound and do not result in quantitative 
conversion of SiH to vinyl ether. In contrast, the method of 
the present invention achieves quantitative conversion of 
hydridosilane or siloxanes to vinyl ether, a preferred 
radiation sensitive group. The present invention introduces a method for 
making vinyl ether functional siloxane, the method comprising 
(I) mixing a silane, a vinyl ether compound and a hydrosilylation 
catalyst to form a reaction product, (II) adding a 
polydiorganosiloxane to the reaction product of (I), and 
(III) adding a condensation catalyst to the mixture of (II). 
In another embodiment, the present invention comprises a 
process comprising steps (I) - (III) above, then (IV) adding 
a photocleavable acid to the mixture of (III), applying the  
 
mixture from (IV) to a solid substrate to form a coating and 
then exposing the coating to actinic radiation or a 
combination of actinic radiation and heat. The present 
invention further provides a vinyl ether functional polysiloxane 
compound and to a curable composition comprising the 
polysiloxane in combination with a photocleavable acid. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a novel method of preparing UV (ultraviolet) or EB 
(electron beam) curable organopolysiloxanes suitable for 
paper release applications. It is also an object of the present invention to 
produce silicone vinyl ether copolymers or oligomers which 
are curable by addition of photocleavable acids and exposure 
to UV or EB radiation. It is a further object of this invention to provide 
UV- curable silicone compositions which may be catalyzed by a 
variety of curing catalysts at especially rapid cure rates. Thus, a method of making a
