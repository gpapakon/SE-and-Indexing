<ABSTRACT>
A microcomputer comprises a plurality of peripheral circuits 
accessed by a central processing unit for a reading/writing of the 

peripheral circuits. Each of external terminals supplies a selection signal 
indicative of use or non-use of a corresponding peripheral circuit. Each 

selection signal is supplied to a gate circuit provided for the 
corresponding peripheral circuit, for controlling permission and 

inhibition of application of a clock signal or a strobe signal to 
corresponding peripheral circuit. Thus, neither the clock nor the strobe 

signal is supplied to the peripheral circuits which are not used in an actual 
application system, with the result that a low power consumption, highly 

reliable microcomputer is realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a one-chip microcomputer having a
plurality of peripheral circuits integrated together with a central
processing unit and others on a single chip, and more specifically to a low
power consumption one-chip microcomputer of this type.In general purpose one-chip microcomputers, not only a central
processing unit (CPU) and memories, but also various kinds of peripheral
circuits including an A/D converter, a D/A converter, a timer, a serial
interface and others for complying with various applications, are formed
on a single chip.Signals for controlling these various kinds of peripheral circuits
formed on the microcomputer chip, include a clock signal generated in a
clock generator for controlling an operation timing of each peripheral
circuit, and a strobe signal generated in the CPU for controlling a timing
of a data read/write operation to the peripheral circuits. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a block diagram of one
example of a conventional microcomputer including four peripheral
circuits.In the microcomputer shown in Figure 1, a clock generator 1
generates a clock signal 2, which is supplied unconditionally and
commonly to a central processing unit (CPU) 3 and all of four peripheral
circuits 41, 42, 43 and 44. The clock signal 2 is used as a time reference,
on the basis of which the operation order in time and the operation timing
of the CPU 3 and the four peripheral circuits 41, 42, 43 and 44 are
determined.The CPU 3 and the four peripheral circuits 41, 42, 43 and 44 are
coupled to each other through an address/data bus 5, and the CPU 3
supplies a strobe signal 6 to all of the four peripheral circuits 41, 42, 43
and 44 for the purpose of controlling a timing of the data read/write
operation to the peripheral circuits 41, 42, 43 and 44. Accordingly, the
timing of the data read/write operation of the CPU 3 to the peripheral
circuits 41, 42, 43 and 44 is determined by this strobe signal 6.In general, as mentioned above, the conventional general purpose
microcomputer includes a plurality of peripheral circuits of various types
formed on the single chip, in order to make it possible for the
microcomputer to be used in different applications. In fact, however,
when this general purpose microcomputer is used in an actual application
system, all of the peripheral circuits formed on the microcomputer chip
are not necessarily used.Therefore, unconditional ceaseless application of the clock 2 and the
strobe signal 6 to all of the peripheral circuits means that the clock
