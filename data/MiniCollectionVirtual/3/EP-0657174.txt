<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of inhibiting 
the growth of benign or malignant tumor. Cholangiocarcinoma refers to any malignancy 
originating in the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. 
These tumors probably represent 10-15% of primary 
hepatobiliary cancers, and their incidence in the United 
States is estimated at up to 3,000 per year (see Yeo et 
al., Surg. Clin. North Amer. 70:1429(1990) and Vogt et 
al., Oncology 2:37(1988)). The prognosis for these 
tumors is universally dismal, with a majority of 
patients dying within six months to one year of 
diagnosis (see Imrie et al., Wright's Liver and Biliary 
Diseases, Vol 2, 3rd ed., page 1516 (1992)). Cholangiocarcinomas are notoriously difficult to 
diagnose. The diagnosis is usually performed by non-invasive 
imaging studies (e.g. ultrasound or CT scan) with 
an overall accuracy of only about 50%. Positive histology 
is required for absolute diagnosis, and this is most 
effectively performed by fine needle aspiration biopsy (see 
Desa et al. Gut 32(10):1188(1991) and Bedrossian et al., 
Arch. Patho. Lab. Med. 113(11):1225(1989)). However, by the 
time this diagnosis is made, the disease has commonly 
reached the point where curative surgical therapy is 
impossible (see Yeo et al., Cholangiocarcinoma (Review) 
Surg. Clin. North Amer. 70:1429(1990) and Miyasaki et al., 
Surg. Ther. 56:443 (1987)). Surgical resection presently provides the best hope 
for cure. However, only ten percent of patients with 
cholangiocarcinomas are surgically treatable because of the 
location of their tumors (see Nargoney et al., Sem. Oncol. 
15:106(1988)). Even after resection, twenty-five percent 
of these patients will still have residual tumors, and the 
five year survival rate for resected patients is only  
 
thirteen percent with an operative mortality up to twelve 
percent (see Yeo et al., Surg. Clin. North Amer. 
70:1429(1990) and Boerma et al., Surgery 215:31(1990)). The possibility of liver transplantation has also been 
attempted as a potential treatment modality. This 
treatment, however, has generally been unsuccessful since 
the recurrence of cholangiocarcinomas is virtually 100%. 
The survivorship, therefore, appears to be no better than 
that of the untreated patient (see Penn et al., Surgery 
110:726(1991) and Jenkins et al., Cancer Chemother. 
Pharmac. 23:S104(1989)). Many liver transplant centres 
have abandoned transplantation of patients with 
cholangiocarcinomas. Other centres consider 
transplantations for cholangiocarcinoma to be experimental
