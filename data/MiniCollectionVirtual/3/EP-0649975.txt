<ABSTRACT>
A meter plate (40) formed from a depending member 
(42) extending from the root (18) of a turbine blade 

(16) to just short of the bottom (44) of the broach in a 
disk (14) in the live rim area is cast integrally with 

the blade (16) and serves with the broach to meter 
coolant flow from an on board injector (12) to 

internally of the blade. The member (42) can be 
machined to the size required to attain the desired 

amount of coolant flow for internal blade cooling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to turbine blades for gas
turbine engines and particularly to means for metering
cooling air to internally cool the turbine blades.As is well known in the gas turbine engine
technology, the cooling of the turbine blades,
particularly the first stage turbine, is extremely
important not only to preserve the integrity of the
blade structure but to also attain high engine
performance by operating the turbine at optimum
temperature levels. It is abundantly important in this
environment to maximize the use of cooling air to avoid
utilizing more air than is necessary so as to lessen the
overall penalty that is attendant the use of engine air
for purposes other than generating thrust or horsepower
Inasmuch as the gas turbine engine operates at higher
efficiencies by operating the first stage turbine at
higher temperatures and the trend for future engines is
to increase turbine inlet temperatures so as enhance
engine efficiency and thereby reduce fuel consumption,
the engine designer is faced with the problem of
increasing turbine inlet temperature while at the same
time attempting to reduce the amount of cooling air or
at the very least to optimize its use.As is well known, one method of optimizing the use
of cooling air is to employ metering devices to restrict
the flow entering into the roots of each of the blades.
Typically, these flow restrictive or metering devices
are comprised of an extra sheet metal component that is
welded or brazed to the bottom of the blade. An example
of a metering device that is bolted to the root of a
stator blade is exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,706,508
granted to Moskowitz, et al on December 19, 1972 and
entitled "Transpiration Cooled Turbine Blade with 
Metered Coolant Flow".United Kingdom Patent Application No. 2 225 063 A
published for Ulrich Radons on May 23, 1990 entitled
"Turbine Cooling Arrangement" discloses an insert that
is bonded to the blade base for flowing coolant into the
rotor blades. Other patents that, while not necessarily
teaching metering means, but relate to means for feeding
coolant to the turbine rotor blades are U.S. Patent No.
4,767,261 granted to Godfrey et al on February 12, 1974
entitled "Cooled Vane" that utilizes a baffle plate
internally of the vane; U.S. Patent No. 3,791,758
granted to Jenkinson on February 12, 1974 entitled
"Cooling of Turbine Blades" that includes divergent
walls for defining a diffuser for leading coolant to the
root of the blades; and U.S. Patent No. 4,626,169
granted to Hsing et al on December 2,

A rotor comprising a blade (16) having internal
cooling passages, said blade (16) being mounted by a

root section (18) in a recess on a rotor disk (14), said
blade (16) being cast with an integral projection (42)

at its root section,

   characterised in that said projection defines a
coolant metering area (48) within said recess, the size

or configuration of said projection being modifiable
after casting to define a desired metering area.

(40) to regulate the flow of cooling air from said

recess into said passages, the length of said projection
being modifiable after casting so as to select the

amount of metering by said metering plate (40).
The rotor as claimed in claim 3 wherein said disk
(14) includes a pair of opposing side walls (50,52) and
