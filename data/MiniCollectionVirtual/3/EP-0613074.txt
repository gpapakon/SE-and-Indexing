<ABSTRACT>
A microprocessor circuit is provided that allows 
the internal microprocessor clock speed to vary 

depending upon a register that can be programmed by 
software. In addition, the drive strength of the 

internal clock generator may similarly be varied by 
software programming. The programmer or user of the 

microprocessor may change the internal clock speed such 
that the microprocessor operates at a first frequency or 

at a second frequency depending upon the performance 
requirements. A lower frequency of operation may be 

selected for low power consumption and low EMI, while a 
higher frequency of operation may be selected for 

computational intensive and high performance 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microprocessor circuitry and, more
particularly, to the generation of internal microprocessor clock
signals.EP-A-316 943 discloses a microprocessor circuit having a timing
signal source providing two signals having different frequencies; a
clock generating circuit generating an internal clock signal; a timing
distribution circuit selectively providing one of the two signals of
the timing signal source to the clock generating circuit depending on
a select signal and a software programmable clock select circuit
selectively providing either the first or second signal of the timing
signal source to the clock generating circuit.WO-A-92/09028 discloses a microprocessor circuit also having a
clock generating circuit for generating an internal clock signal at a
frequency selected from one of two frequencies.US-A-5 153 450 discloses a programmable output drive circuit
having multiple drive capabilities for optimizing noise margins of
different frequencies. The level of drive capability is selected
according to frequency.Microprocessor circuits require clock signals to provide timing
references for controlling activities within the microprocessor. A
microprocessor typically receives an external clock signal generated by
a crystal oscillator or other external clock source and, using this
external clock signal, generates an internal clock signal having a high
degree of stability with a fifty percent duty cycle. The internally
generated clock signal may have the same frequency as that of the
external clock signal or may have a frequency that is a fraction or a
multiple of the external clock signal frequency.CMOS integrated circuit microprocessors, for proper operation
thereof, generally must be clocked by an internal clock signal having
a first phase and a second phase for each clock cycle period. The
clock signal first phase is at a high level for a first execution time
period and the second phase is at a low level for a second execution
time period to complete each clock cycle. The reason for this clocking
procedure is that CMOS integrated circuits include circuitry wherein a 
first portion of the circuitry is active during the high level first
phase of the clock signal and the other portion of the circuitry is
active during the low level 
second phase of the clock signal. For this reason, the
microprocessor typically generates a pair of internal
clock signals that are 180 degrees out of phase, one
being provided to the first portion of the circuitry and
the second being provided to the
