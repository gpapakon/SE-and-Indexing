<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-compensated voltage regulator includes a field effect 
transistor voltage buffer (30) which receives a high-voltage (HV
IN
) input and provides a 
low-voltage output (V
REG
), and a voltage generator having a series connection of a 
zener diode (32) and at least one p-n junction diode (34, 36, 38) for generating a 

reference voltage. The voltage generator is coupled between the low-voltage output 
(V
REG
) of the voltage buffer (30) and the input of a current mirror (40, 42), with the 
output of the current mirror being coupled to the gate electrode of the field effect 

transistor (30) in the voltage buffer. Additionally, the output of the current mirror (40, 
42) is coupled to the low-voltage output (V
REG
) of the voltage buffer by a resistor 
(R
L
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of voltage regulators, and relates more
particularly to a temperature-compensated voltage regulator capable of producing a low-voltage
output from a high-voltage input.Voltage regulator circuits are presently used to provide regulated power
supply voltage in a wide variety of circuits and in various integrated circuit applications.
Several different voltage regulator circuits are shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,023,543
and 4,792,749, and in European Patent Specification No. 0 183 185. However, the
prior-art regulator circuits suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as the inability to
operate with extremely high input voltages, undue circuit complexity and expense, the
inability to provide self-biasing and self-starting, instability, high power consumption,
and the use of components which are difficult or costly to integrate.Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a voltage regulator which can
operate with extremely high voltage inputs, which is simple and inexpensive to
manufacture, and which provides high performance in a simple and compact circuit
configuration.It is thus an object of the invention to provide a temperature-compensated
voltage regulator which is capable of providing a low-voltage output from a very high
voltage input. It is a further object of the invention to provide a voltage regulator
having high performance, low power consumption, self-starting and self-biasing
capability in a stable, compact and economical configuration.In accordance with the invention, these objects are achieved by a new
temperature-compensated voltage regulator which includes a voltage buffer for receiving
a high-voltage input and providing a low-voltage output, and a voltage generator for
generating a reference voltage coupled between the low-voltage output of the voltage
buffer and an input of a current mirror, with the output of the current mirror being 
coupled to a control input of the buffer and, through a resistor, to the low-voltage
output of the voltage buffer.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the voltage buffer is a field
effect transistor, such as a JFET or a depletion-mode MOS FET, and the voltage
generator is formed by a series connection of a zener diode and at least one p-n
junction
diode. The current mirror, which couples the voltage generator to the control input of
the field effect transistor and to the resistor, is composed of a diode-connected
transistor
having its control electrode coupled to the voltage generator and also to the control
electrode of
