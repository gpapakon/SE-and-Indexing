<ABSTRACT>
A power port terminal (10) formed by stamping from a blank (B) of conductive material comprises a contact receiving socket portion (12) and an integral trailing mounting portion (14). The socket includes a web (16) with a plurality of beams (20) thereon. Each of the beams has a curved surface (205) with a bend (20B) therein. The inner surface of the beams on the bends thereof define a substantially continuous cylindrical contact surface (28) at a predetermined point (30) along the reference axis of the terminal. The contact surface has a predetermined constricted dimension (36) measured in a plane perpendicular to the reference axis, this dimension being the most constricted dimension along the reference axis of the terminal. The terminal is thereby able to accommodate a pin of any desired axial length. The trailing mounting portion (14) has a set of mounting legs (46) thereon that, the preferred instance, extend generally perpendicular to the reference axis of the terminal. Latch tabs (38) may be provided on one or more of the beams.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a
socket-type terminal for use in effecting a relatively high-amperage
power connection with a male pin of any desired
length.Description of the Prior Art A power port terminal for
interconnecting a backplane with a male pin plug may be
formed in any one of a variety of ways. United States Patent
4,702,707 (Hillbish) illustrates a power terminal that includes a
base to which a mating component having a socket may be
attached. In this terminal the base and a portion of the mating
component are formed as screw machined parts. United States
Patent 4,749,357 (Foley) shows a power connector in which a
socket defined from a crown band of spring contact beams is
inserted into a block of conductive material. In both of these
arrangements the contact beams of the terminal extend around
the entire 360° periphery of the male pin. However, since one
end of the terminal is closed, the socket may accept a pin
having only a predetermined limited axial dimension.The power terminal shown at page 334, 335 of the
DuPont Electronics Interconnect and Packaging Catalogue,
August 1988, is also a machined part having a socket that may
accept a pin having only a predetermined limited axial
dimension. This part also includes a snap-ring latch
arrangement which is received about the socket of the terminal
and which cooperates with a housing to retain the terminal.The terminal shown in United States Patent 4,002,400
(Evans), assigned to the assignee of the present invention, is
formed from a stamped blank of conductive material. Again,
however, it appears that the socket portion of the terminal is
blocked at an axially rearward point by a wire crimp barrel 
and an insulation crimp barrel, effectively limiting the axial dimension of a pin
receivable in the socket.The power terminal forming a part of the DuPont HPC Connector System, as
shown at page 6 of Bulletin 712, January 1987, is fabricated from a stamped blank of
conductive metal. Although in this terminal the length of the pin receivable by the
socket is not limited, the socket region does not fully surround the pin when the same
is received therein.In view of the foregoing it is believed advantageous to provide a socket formed
from a stamped conductive metal that effectively both surrounds a male pin and yet
does not limit the axial length of pin receivable therein.Further examples of prior art terminals are described in US-S-2689337, US-A-3026496,
US-A-3083351, US-A-4666227, US-A-4824380 and US-A-4837927.According to

<CLAIMS>
A female-type power port terminal (10) for connecting to a male plug; said
female-type power port comprising:


a contact receiving portion (12) having a web (16) and a plurality of beams or
fingers (20) that are unitary with said web, said beams or fingers (20) being arranged

to form an axially extended socket (26) that is aligned about a reference axis (10A),
each of said beams or fingers (20) having a free end that is distal from said web, said

free ends being unconnected to each other except through said web (16), each of said
beams or fingers (20) further having a bend (20B) therein proximate said free end, said

bends (20B) together defining a contact surface (20S) that is constructed and arranged
to surround and contact a male plug that is inserted into said socket, said contact

surface (20S) being the most constricted point along said reference axis in said
terminal; and
a mounting portion (14) that is unitary with and extends longitudinally from
said contact receiving portion (12) and is formed together with said contact receiving

portion from a single blank of conductive material, said mounting portion (14)
comprising a hood region (40) that is curved about said reference axis (10A) to define

a space that is coextensive and aligned with said socket (26), said hood region (40)
being open at least to permit a plug to pass into said space; characterized in that the

hood region (40) is curved about said reference axis (10A) by substantially 270° and
said mounting portion (14) further comprising a plurality of mounting legs (46) thereon

for mounting the terminal on a substrate; 
whereby said terminal, as a result of said unconnected free ends, is constructed
to accept male plugs within a wide range of cross-sectional dimensions, and, as a result

of said open space defined by said hood region (40), is constructed to accept a male
plug of a wide range of lengths.
A power port terminal according to claim 1, wherein the mounting legs (46)
extend generally perpendicularly to the refer
ence axis (10A).
A power port terminal according to claim 1, wherein the mounting legs (46)
extend generally parallel to the reference axis (10A).
A power port terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein at least
one of the beams or fingers (20) has a latch tab (38) thereon.
A power port or terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein at least
two of the beams or fingers (20) each have a latch tab (38) thereon.
A power port terminal according to any one of the preceding claims and made
by stamping the blank of conductive material.
