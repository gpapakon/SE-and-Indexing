<CLAIMS>
The use of

(A) esters of phosphoric acid andlor partial salts thereof with alkoxylated
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic alcohols and
(B) fatty acid oligodialkanolamides (reaction products of fatty acids and
dialkanolamines in an at least 0.5-fold molar excess of dialkanolamine)

as inhibitors against the formation of incrustations based on organic solids
from flowable liquid andlor gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures with a tendency to

form such incrustations.
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that surface-active
inhibitors (A) and (B) capable of wetting and, in particular, spreading on hard

surfaces, even in the presence of the flowable hydrocarbon phase, are used.
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the surface-active
inhibitors are applied to the walls to be protected, optionally in the form

of a solution and/or emulsion or dispersion in aqueous and/or organic
auxiliary liquids, the inhibitors preferably being added in small quantities to

the incrustation-forming hydrocarbon mixtures.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the surface-active
inhibitors are added to liquid hydrocarbon mixtures in quantities of 5

to 1,000 ppm, preferably in quantities of 10 to 500 ppm and more preferably
in quantities of 20 to 200 ppm.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in that mixtures of (A)
and (B) in quantity ratios of A to B of 5:95 to 95:5, preferably 25:75 to 75:25

and more preferably 40:60 to 60:40 are used.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in that partial esters of
phosphoric acid and/or salts thereof with alkoxylated phenol compounds are

used as the surface-active component (A), mono- and/or diesters of
phosphoric acid or salts thereof with ethoxylated and/or propoxylated alkyl 

phenols being preferred.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a mixture of the
salts of mono- and diesters of phosphoric acid with ethoxylated nonylphenols

containing on average 5 to 10 ethylene oxide units per mole of nonylphenol
is used as component (A), the corresponding alkali metal salts, ammonium

salts, alkanolamine salts andlor amine salts being preferred.
The use claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
oligoalkanolamides prepared from saturated andlor unsaturated C
12-24

monocarboxylic acids and a molar excess of dialkanolamines, more
particularly diethanolamine, are used as component (B).
The use claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized in that reaction
products - flowable under normal conditions - of preferably at least

predominantly unsaturated C
16-20
 carboxylic acids and diethanolamine in a 0.5
to 3-fold molar excess over the quantity of carboxylic acid are used as

component (B). 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized in that reaction products of the
reaction of tall oil fatty acids with diethanolamine in molar ratios of about 1:1.5-3

with elimination of water and at least partial oligomerization of the diethanolamine
are used as component (B).
The use claimed in claims 1 and 10, characterized in that the incrustation inhibitors
are used in crude oils and/or in oil fractions with a tendency to form incrustations,

more particularly for protecting pipelines, pumps, filters, tanks and the like against
the unwanted formatio
n of incrustations.
