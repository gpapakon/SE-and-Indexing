<ABSTRACT>
A switch housing for plural switches is formed of thermoplastic molded in a 
first stage with grooves or recesses. In a second stage molding process, the 

grooves are filled with platable thermoplastic which is subsequently plated with 
copper, nickel, or silver to provide conductive strips and exposed contact areas. A 

common switch actuator is slidably and rotatably mounted on the housing. Upon 
pushing the actuator is latched to actuate a switch; and, upon subsequent pushing 

the actuator is unlatched and the switch de-actuated. Upon rotation of the 
actuators, independently of the push-to-actuate movement, a second rotary switch 

is actuated. Both switches employ the two-stage molding and plating for forming 
integrally with the housing and the stationary contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to low voltage switches and particularly to 
switches employed for automotive switching applications where it is desired to 
provide a push-to-actuate function for user control of certain convenience items 
or accessories. In certain automotive switching applications it has been deemed 
desirable to provide a rotary type switch action for ergonomic reasons, and to 
prevent confusion of the user as to which switch controls what function as 
among a group of switches. In certain automotive switch applications, it has been desired to combine 
a push-to-actuate switch and a rotary switch function for controlling separate 
switching functions with a common actuator. Known switch designs for 
combining a push-to-actuate and rotary actuation have resulted in switches 
which are complicated in construction and costly to manufacture. The 
marketplace for automotive switches for mass-produced vehicles is quite 
competitive, so low manufacturing cost is required in order to maintain a 
competitive position in such a market. Accordingly, it has been desired to provide a switch having a combined 
push-to-actuate and rotary movement for user control of separate switching 
functions, and to provide such a switch which is reliable when operated over a 
relatively high number of repeated actuations and is low in manufacturing cost. The switch assembly of the present invention has a pushable actuator 
which is slidably mounted on the housing through a rotatable disc such that 
rotation of the actuator member causes the disc to rotate; and, pushing of the 
actuator without rotation effects sliding movement of a non-rotatable member. 
The non-rotatable member effects actuation of a latching member which effects 
push-to-actuate/push-to-deactuate functioning of a movable switching contact  
 
member. The movable switching contact member is in the form of a shorting 
bar which makes sliding contact with a pair of stationary contact members or 
strips. The stationary contact strips are formed of conductively plated 
thermoplastic material. The thermoplastic material is molded in two stages: a 
first stage of unplatable material forming the switch housing and having a 
recess provided therein, and a second stage which fills the recess with platable 
thermoplastic material which is subsequently plated on the exposed surface 
with conductive material to form the stationary contact strips. The two-stage 
molding of the housing with the contact surfaces subsequently formed by 
plating provides a
