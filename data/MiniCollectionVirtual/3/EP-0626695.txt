<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a memory module using a 
large capacity DRAM without a self-refresh mode, which 

maintains the contents of the memory irrespective of non-input 
of a refresh signal from a computer. A memory module (20) 

includes twenty DRAMs (24) soldered on a surface and rear 
face of a substrate (22). A connector (26) equiped on an 

edge of the substrate (22) is inserted into a memory 
extension slot (8) of a computer (1) to connect the substrate 

(22) electrically with the computer (1). When the computer 
(1) outputs refresh signals RASm and CASn within or at 

intervals of 500 nanoseconds, a gate array (28) included in 
the memory module (20) outputs these RASm and CASn signals 

to the DRAMs (24). When 500 nanoseconds have elapsed since 
fall of both the RASm and CASn signals to a low level, on 

the other hand, the gate array (28) generates artificial 
refresh signals RFRS and RFCS, splits the RFRS signal into 

five and the RFCS signal into four, and outputs the split 
signals to the DRAMs (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory module
installed in a memory extension slot of a computer, and more
specifically to a memory module using a DRAM (dynamic random
access memory) which requires refreshing of memory contents
at or within predetermined time intervals. The invention is
also directed to a method of refreshing the memory module.An element typically used for main storage of a
computer is a DRAM having a simple internal structure and
readily increasing storage capacity. For the reason of
cost reduction and appropriate specification, a general
computer nas only one DRAM, having a capacity sufficient for
allowing operation of typical software, as a main memory
unit. When the user requires a larger storage capacity, a
separately available memory module having a DRAM is inserted
into a memory extension slot of the computer. This realizes
inexpensive and easy extension of the storage area. The DRAM used for data storage in the computer stores
information by accumulated charges in a capacitor. A
refreshing process for re-writing the memory contents at
predetermined intervals is thus required for effective data
storage and retention. When the computer executes such
refreshing process, however, large loading applied onto the
computer undesirably decreases the speed of data processing
of the computer. An improved DRAM recently proposed has a
self-refresh mode for executing the refreshing process. The
DRAM having the self-refresh mode does not require output of
an instruction signal or an address signal for refreshing
(hereinafter referred to as refresh signal) from the computer
to the DRAM, and works as if the memory module is constructed
as an SRAM (static random access memory). This effectively
reduces the loading applied onto a CPU of the computer with
the DRAM.The DRAM having the self-refresh mode includes a
specific circuit for executing internal refreshing. This
specific circuit, however, has a complicated structure and
occupies a large space in a restricted area of a semi-conductor
chip. The self-refresh mode is accordingly applied to DRAMs
having a relatively small storage capacity. A computer is
generally designed to output an instruction signal for
refreshing, thus being applicable to a memory module which
has a non-self-refreshing DRAM and which is inserted
into an extension slot of the computer. When the computer has only one memory extension slot, a
memory module inserted into the extension slot should have a
large capacity DRAM for significant increase of the main
storage area.
