<ABSTRACT>
In the case of dough dividers with measuring chambers, in which the dough is pressed into the measuring chambers (41) via a filling piston (3) and is ejected via measuring pistons (42), it is necessary for the said pistons to be cleaned when the dough is changed and before shut- down periods. Such cleaning is only possible when the measuring pistons (42) and the filling piston (3) are held in a certain position. The invention is used to achieve the desired cleaning position by means of pressure on a button (switch 73, 74) which causes activation of a limit switch (9) which is actuated via a cam plate (8) which is arranged on the divider transmission system.

<CLAIMS>
Dough divider with metering chamber comprising a metering chamber
support (4) which is disposed such that, while cutting off dough, it can be

moved past a loading chamber (2) that is disposed below a dough funnel
(11), and that the dough pressed into the metering chambers by way of a

loading piston (3) is discharged by metering pistons (42) and handed over
to a round kneader disposed on the machine frame (1) or to a conveyor

belt, all movable components being connected with a driving motor (5) by
way of a branching gear and corresponding transmission elements, it being

possible to operate the driving motor (5) by a start-stop switch (71, 72),
characterized in that, for a certain stop position to be attained, at least one

further switch (73; 74) is provided, by means of which to activate corresponding
means causing the stop of the machine in the position of removal

of the metering pistons (42) or of the loading piston (3), said means for
detecting the position of the machine and for switch-off in a certain stop

position being operatable switches, in particular light or solenoid switches.
Dough divider with metering chamber according to claim 1, characterized
in that a cam disk (8) is disposed on the branching gear and is in

working connection with a stop switch (9) to be operated by the switch
(73).
Dough divider with metering chamber according to claim 2, characterized
in that the cam disk (8) is provided with two cams (81, 82) and that the

end switch (9) can be operated selectively by two switches (73; 74).
