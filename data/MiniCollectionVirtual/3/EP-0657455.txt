<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with novel epi-epibatidine derivatives, 
a process and intermediates for preparing them and 
epi-epibatidine and medicaments containing the epi-epibatidine 
derivatives and/or epi-epibatidine and the use of them. Epi-epibatidine of formula 
has been known from the Prior Art (D. F. Huang, T. Y. Shen: 
Tetrahedron Letters 34 [1993], pages 4477 to 4480). However, 
the Prior Art is silent in disclosing any pharmaceutical effect 
of epi-epibatidine. Furthermore epibatidine and derivatives of it, in which 
the 2-position is substituted by a cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl 
or phenoxy group, optionally substituted, and their analgesic 
activity have been known (WO 93/18037). However, it contains 
no reference to epi-epibatidine and its derivatives. The problem underlying to the invention is to create novel 
compounds of the epi-epibatidine derivative type having valuable 
pharmacological effects, particularly analgesic effect, a 
process and intermediates for preparing them and epi-epibatidine 
and medicaments containing the novel compounds of the 
epi-epibatidine derivative type and/or epi-epibatidine and the 
use of them. The above surprisingly has been attained by the invention.  The subject-matter of the invention are epi-epibatidine 
derivatives of general formula 
wherein 
Rstands for a C₁₋₄-alkyl, C₂₋₄-alkenyl, C₂₋₄-alkinyl, 
C₃₋₇-cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aryl-C₁₋₄-alkyl 
or heteroaryl-C₁₋₄-alkyl group, said 
groups optionally being substituted by 1 or 
more C₁₋₄-alkyl, C₂₋₄-alkenyl, C₂₋₄-alkinyl, c₃₋₇-cycloalkyl, 
aryl, heteroaryl, aryl-C₁₋₄-alkyl, 
heteroaryl-C₁₋₄-alkyl, hydroxy, C₁₋₄-alkoxy, phenoxy, 
halogen, halogeno-C₁₋₄-alkyl and/or amino, 
amido and/or sulfonamido substituent(s), optionally 
mono- or di-C₁₋₄-alkyl-, -C₂₋₄-alkenyl- and/or 
-C₂₋₄-alkinyl substituted, and R'represents hydrogen or a C₁₋₄-alkyl, C₂₋₄-alkenyl, c₂₋₄-alkinyl, 
C₃₋₇-cycloalkyl, C₃₋₇-cycloalkenyl, C₃₋₇-cycloalkinyl, 
aryl-C₁₋₄-alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, halogeno-C₁₋₄-alkyl, 
hydroxy-C₁₋₄-alkyl or, preferably C₁₋₄-aliphatic, 
aromatic or heterocyclic, acyl group
 
   with the proviso that,  if R'stands for hydrogen, Ris different from 6-(chloro)-pyrid-3-yl  
as well as optically active forms and acid addition salts thereof. The term "C₁₋₄-alkyl" relates to straight or branched chained 
alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atom(s), e. g. methyl, 
ethyl, n-propyl or isopropyl, preferably methyl. The term 
"C₂₋₄-alkenyl" relates to straight or branched chained unsaturated 
aliphatic hydrocarbon groups
