<ABSTRACT>
A convergence control system for multiple vertical 
modes or formats, having respective rasters with different 

vertical heights, comprises a selector (4) for initiating 
operation in one of the available vertical modes, and a 

circuit (40) for generating convergence correction signals 
responsive to the selector. The correction signals are 

generated from known convergence correction values and by 
interpolation of the known values. The convergence 

correction values may be stored and sequentially processed 
by digital circuits and the interpolation may be undertaken 

by analog circuits. The circuit for generating convergence 
correction signals may comprise a digital data store (46) 

for different sets of convergence correction values, for 
generating selectable sets of correction signals for 

different vertical modes or formats, for example normal and 

overscanned modes. The sets of convergence correction 
values define different sets of grid lines and rows of 

horizontal scan lines. Adjacent ones of the grid lines are 
spaced from one another at different intervals for 

different vertical formats. The intervals between adjacent 
horizontal grid lines are greater for vertical formats 

having rasters with greater vertical heights. An 
interpolating circuit (40) for processing the known 

convergence correction values is responsive to the 
horizontal deflection circuit. The interpolating intervals 

can be adjusted to correspond to the horizontal scanning 
rate. The number of interpolating intervals is matched to 

the number of horizontal scan lines in each row.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
convergence control systems in television apparatus, and in 
particular, to convergence control systems operable with 
different vertical formats, for example, vertical formats 
having different raster heights. Convergence control systems must be consistent 
with the vertical format utilized by a television 
apparatus. The vertical format which must be employed will 
be a function of the aspect ratio of the display means in 
the television apparatus and the aspect ratio of the images 
in a video source. The aspect ratio of an image is the 
relative proportion of image width to image height. For 
most television apparatus, the aspect ratio of the display 
means is 4:3. This is true for display means embodied as 
the image display area of a conventional cathode ray tube 
as well as the screen for a projection television 
apparatus. Similarly, the aspect ratio of most video 
sources is 4:3. Under these circumstances, only a single, 
standard vertical format need be provided. When it is 
expected that no changes in vertical format will occur, a 
fixed convergence control scheme can be formulated 
accordingly. However, not all video sources originate with a 
4:3 aspect ratio. Motion pictures, for example, are 
transferred from film format to videotape format, for 
playback or transmission as television signals. It has 
been the practice when converting such motion picture 
sources to a video format to change the aspect ratio to 
4:3, as that is the only aspect ratio at which most 
television apparatus can function. An interesting example 
of the difficulties entailed by this process are wide-screen 
sources, such as cinemascope, which may have an 
aspect ratio of 16:9. A 16:9 aspect ratio is considered a 
wide aspect ratio. When transferring film sources to 
videotape, a device such as a flying spot telecine may be 
employed. A flying spot telecine has a viewing window or  
 
frame with an aspect ratio of 4:3. Typically, an operator 
moves the window back and forth, from left to right, 
tracking the center of action in the film, and cropping 
more or less of the left and right portions of the film 
image as necessary. This can often produce undesirable 
results from an artistic point of view. In cases where 
credits appear, or action takes place over the entire 
horizontal extent of the film image, the results are 
unsatisfactory. The results of the flying spot technique 
are exemplified by the sketch in FIGURE 2a, where picture 
information from the 16:9
