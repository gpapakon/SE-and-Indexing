<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method of decorating or marking, for example, 
synthetic resin objects by means of an UV-laser or IR-laser by coating the object with a 

layer of a dye precursor and a coupler in a binder. For the precursor use is made of a 
heterocyclic mono- or bis-arylsulphonylhydrazone and for the coupler use is made of, 

for example, an indole, aniline, pyrazoline or malonitrile, so that after irradiation with 
UV-laser light or IR-laser light an azo-dye (XXX) is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of marking a surface of an object by
means of a laser light beam, according to the preamble of claim 1.The method in accordance with the invention can be used for marking
objects which are at least locally provided with a light-sensitive layer which consists of
the above-mentioned mixture. The term "marking" is to be understood to mean herein:
the provision of characters such as letters, numbers, symbols, figures, decorations and
the like. The objects may be made of, for example metal, glass or synthetic resin.
Examples of synthetic resin objects are: housings for domestic appliances and products
for personal care such as shavers. Such housings are marked, inter alia, with a type
code and are often provided with logos and coloured decorations in the form of lines
and areas.Such a method is known from United States Patent document US-A-4,742,042.
In the known method a layer of a mixture consisting of a dye precursor,
bis(3-allyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)sulphone as the developer, a heat-sensitive substance (heat
sensitizer) and a binder are provided on a support. By locally heating said layer with,
for example, a laser a coloured image is formed in said layer.A disadvantage of the known method is that only the compounds which
react with said hydroxyphenyl coupler can be used as dye precursors. According to said
Patent document, fluoranes and fluorenes are suitable precursors. The colour of the
dyes formed ranges from blue to green. To obtain a mixed colour a second leuco dye
must be added to the mixture. In said United States Patent document no description is
given of how other colours, such as violet, yellow and orange must be made. A further
disadvantage is that said dyes can only be formed in a thermal process, i.e. using
infrared radiation, and not in a photochemical process using ultraviolet radiation. A still
further disadvantage is that the layer in which the dye is formed must be provided with 
a protective coating comprising UV-absorbing substances to improve the resistance of
the colour image formed against light and other environmental factors.It is an object of the invention to provide, inter alia, an alternative
method which enables the entire visible colour spectrum to be provided as a marking on
a surface by means of a laser and without using a second dye. In this method the dye
can be formed both by thermal and photochemical processes, and a protective layer to
improve the stability of the colour image can be omitted.According to the invention, this object is

<CLAIMS>
A method of marking a surface of an object by means of a laser light
beam, said surface being coated with a layer of a mixture which comprises at least a dye

precursor, an organic coupler compound having an active hydrogen atom, and a binder,
after which the layer is irradiated in accordance with the desired marking by the laser

light beam, so that the precursor is converted to a dye in the irradiated areas of the layer,
characterized in that an azo-dye is formed as the dye, and that


either infrared laser light is used, and that a heterocyclic bis-sulphonylhydrazone is used
as the precursor; or
ultraviolet laser light is used, and that a heterocyclic mono- or bis-sulphonylhydrazone
is used as the precursor, and that a UV-sensitizer is added in the mixture.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the bis-sulphonylhydrazone
used is bis-tosylhydrazone of 3-methylbenzothiazole or of 4,5-tetramethylene-3-methylthiazole.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the bis-sulphonylhydrazone
used is a tosyl-octylsulphonyl hydrazone.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the UV-sensitizer is
benzophenone, 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone or 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that mono-tosylhydrazone
of 3-methylbenzothiazole or of 4,5-tetramethylene-3-methylthiazole is

used as the mono-sulphonylhydrazone.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, characterized in

that a polymer is used as the binder.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, characterized in
that an indole, aniline, phenol or an active methylene compound is used as the organic
