fluid, after it has been used for its analytical application, is expanded such that the energy of 

expansion of the pumping fluid can be employed for cooling the pump head or pumping fluid 
prior to pumping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the pumping of compressible pumping fluids for use with
analytical apparatus and in particular, controlling the expansion of the pumping fluid to ambient
pressure such that the energy of expansion can be used to cool the pumping fluid to sub-ambient
temperatures prior to pumping.Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) and Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE)
apparatus typically include pumping systems for pumping highly compressible fluids (for
example, liquified CO2), at flow rates on the order of 5g/min. Maintaining the pumping fluid
at sub-ambient temperatures prior to pumping reduces the compressibility of a compressible
pumping fluid such that it can be accurately pumped.It is known that direct application of a cryogenic fluid may be used to cool the pump
head of pumping apparatus, however, an independent source of cryogenic fluid is typically
employed. U.S. Patent No. 5,142,875 entitled "Cooled Pumping
System" discloses a single source of cryogenic fluid applied to a heat exchanger through
cryogenic input nozzle 112 to simultaneously cool the pump head and the pumping fluid prior
to and during pumping, thus reducing the bulk moduius of the pumping fluid. Since the
compression stage is now isothermal, the solvent delivery is relatively accurate and the mass
flow can be easily calculated using the first law of thermodynamics and mass conservation
equations.In particular, the pump head 110 acts as a heat exchanger in which cryogenic fluid
may be supplied to a cryogenic input nozzle 112 and expanded to ambient pressure. The
expanded cryogenic fluid simultaneously cools the pre-cooler supply tube 116, the pump head
110 and ultimately, the pumping fluid which is input through the pumping fluid input 118. The 
pump head 110 is made of a material having a much higher thermal conductivity than the rest
of the pump body. A thermal insulator 120 is disposed between the pump head and the pump
body such that the pump head is effectively thermally insulated from the pump body. The
precooler supply tube 116 is thermally coupled to a channel 117 along the top of the pump head.
Since the length of tube is relatively long in relation to the tube diameter, it acts as a heat
exchanger and dissipates heat from the pumping fluid to the pump head.The use of thermoelectric cooling elements to transfer heat from a pump head and to a
heat sink is disclosed in the prior art pumping system illustrated in Figure 2 and is fully
described in U.S. Patent Number 5,180,293 entitled
