<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultraviolet absorber, 2H-1-benzopyran-2-on 
compound which is suited for the ultraviolet absorber, 
and a thermoplastic resin composition and formed article thereof which 
comprise said ultraviolet absorber. Thermoplastic resins such as polyester, polymethyl methacrylate 
and polyvinyl chloride have excellent mechanical strengths and are 
widely used for films and other formed articles in view of their 
chemical characteristics. For example, polyester has in recent years 
been used in a large amount for containers of foodstuffs such as drinks, 
seasonings and liquors in terms of its excellent transparency, gas 
barrier property, and safety and hygiene. Window-sticking films have 
been developed for use in buildings and cars, and polyester based films 
in particular have been used in order to prevent window glasses from 
crushing and scattering in case of impact or to cut off heat radiation 
from outside for saving energy in air-conditioning. Further, colored 
polyester films having improved design have lately been marketed in view 
of decorative uses and have rapidly extended demand for the sticking 
film of window glasses which require originality of design and high 
performance. On the other hand, in the field of agriculture and horticulture, 
thermoplastic resin films are used, for example, for growth promotion 
and high volume harvesting of root vegetables and other useful plants. 
Films based on polymethyl methacrylate and polyvinyl chloride are 
applied to a covering material for mulching particularly in view of  
 
light resistance, light transmittance and strength (Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent SHO 53-98242). These containers and films of thermoplastic resin, for example, 
polyester have very excellent barrier property for ultraviolet rays of 
short wave length ranging about 320 nm or less. However, ultraviolet 
and visible rays of long wave length ranging about 320 nm or more 
mostly pass through these containers and films. Consequently, for example, in the case of filling a fruit juice, 
edible oil, liquid seasoning such as "mirin" or dressing, or liquor in 
a polyester container and storing for several months, although there is 
a difference by condition of storage and by the kind of packing of 
foodstuffs, it often causes gradual deterioration of content, for 
example, delicate change in color, taste and odor. Deterioration of 
the content is caused by oxygen, heat, ultraviolet rays or penetration 
of microorganisms. Polyester containers have relatively
