<ABSTRACT>
A method for pitch epoch synchronous encoding of speech 
signals. The method includes steps of providing an input speech 

signal (11), processing (12, 14, 17, 19, 22) the input speech 

signal (11) to characterize qualities including linear predictive 
coding coefficients and voicing, and characterizing excitation 

corresponding to the input speech signals (11) using frequency 
domain techniques (24') when input speech signals (11) 

comprise voiced speech to provide an excitation function (39). 
The method also includes steps of characterizing the input 

speech signals using time domain techniques (24) when the 
input speech signals (11) comprise unvoiced speech to provide 

an excitation function (25) and encoding (41) the excitation 
function (25, 39) to provide a digital output signal (42) 

representing the input speech signal (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to co-pending E.P.O. Patent 
Application Serial No. 92306479.4, filed on July 15 of 1992 and 
Serial No.           , entitled "Excitation Synchronous Time Encoding 
Vocoder And Method", filed on an even date herewith, which are 
assigned to the same assignee as the present application. This invention relates in general to the field of digitally 
encoded human speech, in particular to coding and decoding 
techniques and more particularly to high fidelity techniques for 
digitally encoding speech and transmitting digitally encoded 
speech using reduced bandwidth in concert with synthesizing 
speech signals of increased clarity from digital codes. Digital encoding of speech signals and/or decoding of 
digital signals to provide intelligible speech signals are important 
for many electronic products providing secure communications 
capabilities, communications via digital links or speech output 
signals derived from computer instructions. Many digital voice systems suffer from poor perceptual 
quality in the synthesized speech. Insufficient characterization 
of input speech basis elements, bandwidth limitations and 
subsequent reconstruction of synthesized speech signals from 
encoded digital representations all contribute to perceptual 
degradation of synthesized speech quality. Moreover, some 
information carrying capacity is lost; the nuances, intonations 
and emphases imparted by the speaker carry subtle but 
significant messages lost in varying degrees through corruption  
 
in en- and subsequent de-coding of speech signals transmitted in 
digital form. In particular, auto-regressive linear predictive coding 
(LPC) techniques comprise a system transfer function having all 
poles and no zeroes. These prior art coding techniques and 
especially those utilizing linear predictive coding analysis tend to 
neglect all resonance contributions from the nasal cavities (which 
essentially provide the "zeroes" in the transfer function 
describing the human speech apparatus) and result in 
reproduced speech having an artificially "tinny" or "nasal" 
quality. Standard techniques for digitally encoding and decoding 
speech generally utilize signal processing analysis techniques 
which require significant bandwidth in realizing high quality 
real-time communication. What are needed are apparatus and methods for rapidly 
and accurately characterizing speech signals in a fashion lending 
itself to digital representation thereof as well as synthesis 
methods and apparatus for providing speech
