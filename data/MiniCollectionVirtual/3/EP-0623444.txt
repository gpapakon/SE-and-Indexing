<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink-jet pen cartridge (50) having a rigid 
external frame (78) member fabricated of a rigid engineering 

plastic, and an interior frame structure (68) attached 
thereto, formed of a softer, more ductile plastic material 

than an engineering plastic. An ink reservoir (62) is defined 
by the interior structure and a pair of flexible bag membranes 

(64,66) formed of a plastic material impervious to the ink and 
compatible with the interior member material, allowing the 

membranes (64,66) to be joined to the interior member (68) to 
form a leak-proof joint. The external structure (78) has 

locking features (144) formed into an interior surface. When 
the interior member (68) is injection molded to the external 

member (78), the molten material flows into and around the 

locking features (144), securing the interior member (68) to 
the external member (78) and resisting the shrinkage forces as 

the molten material cools. The ink reservoir (60) is filled 
through a fill port passageway (130) extending through the 

external frame member (78) and the inner member (68). The 
passageway is lined with the softer material of the inner 

member (68), and is sealed by an oversized ball press fit into 
the passageway (130) after the ink filling process. The 

interior frame structure (68) is fabricated from a polymer 
blend composition comprising (A) at least one polymer selected 

from the group consisting of a polyethylene and a copolymer of 
ethylene and an alpha-olefin and (B) at least one polymer 

selected from the group consisting of a polypropylene and a 
copolymer of propylene and ethylene, wherein (A) is different  

 
from (B). The present polymer compositions provide good 

chemical and heat stabilities and solvent resistance when 
subjected to inks used in printing. Further, the present 

polymer compositions are flexible and have excellent 
compatibility and adhesion to the various polymeric components 

used in the ink jet cartridge (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink reservoirs for thermal
ink-jet ("TIJ") print cartridges, and more specifically to
a polymer blend composition useful for ink jet printer
applications.TIJ technology is widely used in computer printers.
Very generally, a TIJ includes a print head typically
comprising several tiny controllable ink-jets, which are
selectively activated to release a jet or spray of ink from
an ink reservoir onto the print media (such as paper) in
order to create an image or portion of an image. TIJ
printers are described, for example, in the Hewlett-Packard
Journal, Volume 36, Number 5, May, 1985, and Volume 39,
Number 4, August, 1988.EP-A-0 519 664 discloses a spring-bag printer ink cartridge
with volume indicator.In EP-A-0 604 712, which has an earlier priority date
but which was published after the priority date of the
present Application, there is disclosed a printer ink
cartridge including an ink reservoir. The cartridge
comprises a frame structure comprising an external frame
structured member fabricated from a first rigid plastic
material and an interior frame member fabricated from a
second plastic material, and first and second impervious
membranes formed of a third material. The membranes are 
joined to the interior frame member to form with the frame
structure, the ink reservoir. The second plastic material
is compatible with the third plastic material to permit a
leak-proof joinder of the membranes of the interior frame
member.Plastic components used for printers must provide a
variety of properties. Specifically, polymer blends used
in making the plastic components must be compatible with
other polymers used in making the other components that
comprise the printer and must be compatible with the inks
used in the printer. When the polymer blend is used in
printer cartridges, the polymers are exposed to inks which
have a variety of materials which may chemically attack the
polymers. When the polymers are weakened by the ink, stress
cracks may lead to ink leakage and smearing of the printing
images.Another problem for polymer blends used in ink
cartridges, is compatibility with the other polymers used in
the construction of the ink cartridge itself. Usually, the
polymers are formed into films and sealed together to form
the ink cartridges. The polymer blend composition has
excellent adhesion to the film structures as well as to the
other polymeric components of the ink cartridge.Accordingly, it is desirable to have polymer blend
compositions which are resistant to chemical attack and
