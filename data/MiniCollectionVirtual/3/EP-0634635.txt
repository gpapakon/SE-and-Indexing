<ABSTRACT>
A measure 1 comprises two separately formed cups 2, 3 
which are assembled by slidably engaging a lug 5 on one 

cup 3 with a groove 6 on the other cup 2. A latch 10 
engages under a shoulder 11 to lock the cups 2, 3 

together. A cup 20 is snapped over the lug 5 and groove 
6 to provide a secondary lock and a drip block to prevent 

any residual liqueur remaining in one cup being poured 
into a glass while another liqueur is being poured from 

the other cup.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a measure and in particular to a 
measure for use in pouring measured quantities of liquid 
beverage products. A liquid beverage product has recently been developed 
which is provided in a single container having two sub-containers, 
one for each liqueur. One of the liqueurs is 
white coloured cream liqueur and the other is a dark 
coloured coffee liqueur. It is intended that a user pours 
the dark liqueur from one of the sub-containers into a 
glass and the white liqueur is then poured down the side 
wall of the glass to lie on top of the dark liqueur to 
present an aesthetically pleasing and pleasant tasting 
liqueur drink. Conveniently the containers are closed by 
separate stoppers which are removed as required for 
pouring a desired liqueur from its container. This invention is particularly directed towards providing 
a measure for use with such twin beverage products. According to the invention, there is provided a measure 
for liquid beverage products comprising a first cup for 
receiving a predetermined amount of a liquid beverage and 
a second cup connected to the first cup for receiving a 
predetermined amount of another liquid beverage. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, 
the cups are separately formed and have respective 
interengaging portions. The interengaging portions may, for example, comprise a 
lug on one cup which slidably engages a groove on the 
other cup.  In one embodiment of the invention, locking means is 
provided for retaining the lug in position in the groove. 
The locking means may comprise a latch means on one of the 
lug or groove for engaging with a shoulder on the other of 
the lug or groove. In another embodiment of the invention, secondary locking 
means are provided for retaining the cups in an assembled 
position. The secondary locking means may, for example, 
comprise a cap overlying the groove and lug, when 
assembled. In one embodiment of the invention, each cup includes a 
rim engaging recess for pouring of liquid from the cup. Drip block means are preferably also included to 
substantially prevent any residual liquid in one cup being 
poured while a desired liquid is being poured from the 
other cup. The drip block means may comprise a raised drip block 
portion in each cup to substantially prevent any residual 
liquid in one cup being poured while a desired liquid is 
being poured from the other cup. Preferably each raised 
portion includes an undercut to substantially prevent 
residual liquid from being poured

<CLAIMS>
A measure (1) for liquid beverage products 
comprising a first cup (2) for receiving a 

predetermined amount of a liquid beverage and a 
second cup (3) connected to the first cup for 

receiving a predetermined amount of another liquid 
beverage. 
A measure as claimed in claim 1 wherein the cups 
(2,3) are separately formed and have respective 

interengaging portions (5,6). 
A measure as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
interengaging portions (5,6) comprise a lug (5) 

on one cup (2) which slidably engages a groove (6) 
on the other cup (3). 
A measure as claimed in claim 3 wherein locking 
means (10,11) are provided for retaining the lug 

(5) in position in the groove (6), preferably the 
locking means (10,11) comprises a latch means (10) 

on one of the lug or groove for engaging with a 
shoulder (11) on the other of the lug or groove. 
A measure as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein secondary locking means (20) are provided 

for retaining the cups in an assembled position, 
preferably the secondary locking means (20) 

comprises a cap (20) overlying the groove (6) and 
lug (5), when assembled. 
A measure as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein each cup (2,3) includes a rim engaging 

recess (25) for pouring of liquid from the cup 
(2,3). 
A measure as claimed in any preceding claim 
including a drip block (20) to substantially 

prevent any residual liquid in one cup (2) being 
poured while a desired liquid is being poured from 

the other cup (3). 
A measure as claimed in claim 7 wherein the drip 
block (20) comprises a raised drip block portion 

(23,24) in each cup (2,3) to substantially prevent

while a desired liquid is being poured from the 
other cup (3), preferably each raised portion 

(23,24) includes an undercut (23a,24a) to 
substantially prevent residual liquid from being 

poured from one cup (2) while a desired liquid is 
being poured from the other cup (3), preferably 

the drip block (20) is provided by a drip block 
cap (20) which overlies a joint between the cups 

(2,3), then assembled and includes depending leg 
portions (23,24) defining the raised drip block 

portions (23,24).
