<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for fabricating fiber optic polarization
maintaining fused couplers. More particularly, this invention relates to the fabrication
of 30 mm long polarization maintaining fused optical couplers.Polarization maintaining (PM) fiber optic single mode couplers are critical
components for both interferometric and resonator type fiber-optic gyroscopes
(FOG's). In a 2X2 PM coupler, light launched along either of the principal axes of a
fiber is split into two parts as the output. The quality of a PM coupler is judged by
the amount of additional loss it introduces and by its capability to maintain the
polarization state launched at the input end. There are two ways of fabricating
couplers: mechanical lapped type, and fused-tapered type. In both the methods
aligning of birefringent principal axes of the two fibers forming the coupler is
necessary. The mechanical-lapped type involves embedding an unjacketed fiber in a
grooved quartz block and mechanically lapping and polishing the block until the fiber
core is reached. Two such blocks are bonded together to form a coupler. Low excess
loss, high extinction ratio lapped PM couplers have been demonstrated but typically
maintain such performance only over a limited temperature range. In addition, lapped
coupler fabrication is labor intensive and time consuming making production quite
expensive.The fuse-tapered couplers, on the other hand, are fabricated by fusing a
section of two fibers and stretching them until the required power splitting ratio is
reached. The fabrication of single mode fused PM couplers involves alignment of
birefringent axes of the fibers in addition to fusion and tapering of fibers. Since fusion
and tapering produces a single piece of glass in the coupling region, fused couplers
generally perform better over environment than do lapped ones. Ease of fabrication
also offers significant production cost reductions over lapped couplers.
Maintaining the polarization through the coupling region requires accurate alignment
of the fibers prior to fusion and tapering. Any advertently caused misalignment
during fusion must be kept low by locally heating the fibers at the line of contact.
The key to successfully making fused PM couplers is the apparatus and tooling needed
for alignment, fusion and tapering. Also, attainment of high performance PM fused
couplers requires the index of the birefringent stress members to be fairly matched
with that of the cladding and the use of small (about 80 Âµm) cladding diameter fiber.GB-A
