<ABSTRACT>

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for handing off a mobile
station from a first channel on a serving base station to a
second channel on a target base station in a mobile communication
system. The method also includes handing off the
mobile station from the first channel to the second channel
in the serving base station. The mobile station is
transmitting bursts at a first transmission phase with respect to time on said first
channel, said second channel being ready to take over the
communication with said mobile station transmitting bursts at a
second transmission phase with respect to time. The invention also relates to an
apparatus for carrying this method into effect.In a mobile communication system, e.g. a cellular mobile
radio system, an inter-cell handoff is the actual switching
of an ongoing call from a base station in one cell to a base
station in another cell, while an intra-cell handoff is the
actual switching of a connection from one channel to another
channel in one and the same base station.Inter-cell handoffs are performed in order to effect a
change of base station, e.g. due to the mobile station
moving in a cellular environment, or to relocate some
traffic from a highly loaded base station to a less loaded
base station.An intra-cell handoff takes place e.g. if the quality on the
currently used channel falls below the minimum accepted quality 
or during a call set-up procedure when handing off the
mobile station from a control channel to a traffic channel.When an inter-cell or intra-cell handoff is performed between
unsynchronized channels or between channels having a
phase difference unknown to the mobile station, the mobile
station must resynchronize itself on to the new channel.
This resynchronization process takes considerable time, e.g.
200 ms, resulting in a non-negligible interruption of the
speech signal which can cause disturbing interruptions in
the ongoing speech.The patent application WO 9222966 shows a method in a
cellular mobile radio telephone system for initially setting
a time alignment parameter in a mobile station. The method
comprises the steps of estimating an optimal time alignment
parameter for use during communication on a new traffic
channel of a desired base station, sending the estimated
time alignment parameter to the mobile station, and setting
the time alignment value in the mobile station.The patent application EP 0430106 A2 shows a method for
hand over in a mobile telephone system, by using mobile
stations with two local oscillators. By having two local
osc
