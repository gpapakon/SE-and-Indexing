A method for epigenetic regulation by stimulating or inhibiting 
in situ
 biosynthesis of a protein by scale resonance, 
characterized by
:

A. Determining the aminoacid sequence of said protein and then the sequence of musical notes corresponding to said aminoacid sequence by decoding and acoustic transposition of time series of quantum vibrations associated to its elongation by operating in the following way:

a) determining the proper frequency of each of the aminoacids in its free state, proportional to its mass, then minimizing the global harmonic distance between the frequencies of these aminoacids for all possible pairs of aminoacids taking into account their proportion in the environing population of transfer RNAs to which said aminoacids link while imposing the condition that the displacement of the initial proper frequency for the free state toward its value for the linked state (synchronized frequency) is less than half the interval between the two synchronized frequencies surrounding this initial frequency, then transposing in the audible range the frequencies thus obtained, which provides a code allowing the stimulation of the biosynthesis of said protein, the inhibiting code being obtained by symmetrization of the logarithms of the heretofore obtained frequencies with respect to their central value taken as the origin;
b) determining the musical periods by spotting homologue sequences of notes and signatures;
c) then determining the lengths of the notes by rectifying collectively then individually the periods determined in b) by adjusting the phrasing to the measure, which is controlled with the help of a keyboard having a "one key play" key;
d) determining the tone quality through the retroaction of all the aminoacids of the protein on the harmonic structure of each of them.
B. 
In situ
 diffusing said musical notes sequence in order to stimulate or inhibit biosynthesis of said protein, either directly or indirectly from
 recordings on any appropriate support of the obtained musical notes sequence, with the exclusion of treatment of human or animal body by therapy.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 producing, with the help of a musical instrument suitably tuned to this end, a chaining of musical notes, the notes being associated to aminoacids according to the specific code for epigenetic stimulation of the biosynthesis of the protein, following the tempered scale:

Gly = low A; Ala = C; Ser = E; Pro, Val, Thr, Cys = F; Leu, lle, Asp, Asn = G; Gln, Glu, Lys, Met = A; His = B flat; Phe (and SeC) = B; Arg, Tyr = sharp C; Trp = sharp D.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 producing, with the help of a musical instrument suitably tuned to this end, a chaining of musical notes, the notes being associated to aminoacids according to the specific code for epigenetic inhibition of the biosynthesis of the protein, obtained by taking the notes of the tempered scale symmetric to those of the code according to claim 2 with respect to the central G:

Trp = C; Arg, Tyr = D; Phe, SeC = E flat; His = E; Gln, Lys, Glu, Met = F; Leu, Ile, Asn, Asp = G; Pro, Val, Thr, Cys = A; Ser = B flat; Ala = sharp D; Gly = sharp F.
A method according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized by
