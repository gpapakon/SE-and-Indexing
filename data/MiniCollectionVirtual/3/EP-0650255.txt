other. Letting the absolute value of the frequency difference dF₀ of the center frequency be |dF₀|, and the passband width be

the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric ceramic
filter circuit and a piezoelectric ceramic filter.Piezoelectric ceramic filters of this type are used, for
example, as IF filters in various mobile communication devices and FM
sound multiplex receivers. To date, the following types of piezoelectric
ceramic filter circuits are well known: multistage type piezoelectric
ceramic filter circuits and ceramic filters with trapped energy type
multiple mode piezoelectric resonators having approximately the same
center frequencies connected in cascade.Insertion loss and group delay characteristics are important
factors in piezoelectric ceramic filter circuits and piezoelectric
ceramic filters. The insertion loss must be maintained at a low level
in order to hold down signal attenuation through filtering. It is
desirable that the group delay characteristics are as flat as possible 
within the pass band so that transmission time difference depending on
frequency will not be created in the signal transmission within the pass
band. Since piezoelectric ceramic filters are minimum phase shift
devices, it is not possible to control the amplitude characteristics and
the group delay characteristics independently. Previous attempts,
therefore, to improve the group delay characteristics have been limited
to keeping the mechanical quality factor Q of the piezoelectric
resonator as low as possible.However, with the prior art, wherein the group delay
characteristics are improved by keeping the mechanical quality factor Q
of the piezoelectric resonator low, the amplitude characteristics
degrade and the insertion loss becomes extremely large, resulting in
lowered filter transmission efficiency. In order to lower the insertion
loss, Q must be high, thereby degrading the group delay characteristics.
In other words, with the prior art, it has been difficult to improve
the insertion loss and the group delay characteristics at the same time.It is the object of the present invention to provide a
piezoelectric ceramic filter circuit and a piezoelectric ceramic
filter, wherein lowered insertion loss and improved group delay
characteristics can be realized at the same time.In order to achieve the afore-mentioned object, the
piezoelectric ceramic filter circuit according to the present invention
comprises a plurality of piezoelectric ceramic filter elements connected
in cascade with each other, of which at least two piezoelectric ceramic
filter elements have different center frequencies and satisfy the 
condition
0 < |dF0| / BW3 <
