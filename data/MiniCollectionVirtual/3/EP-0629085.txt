<ABSTRACT>
A high-definition television receiver includes 
circuitry to decode a received high-definition television 

signal to produce a digital data stream representing the 
corresponding high-definition television image. In 

addition, the receiver includes circuitry which generates 
a signal representing a reduced resolution image from the 

decoded data stream. The receiver provides both the 
high-definition television signal and the reduced 

resolution signal at an output port. A video tape 
recorder (VTR) receives the two signals, segments them 

and formats them onto the tape in a manner which allows a 
majority of the reduced resolution segments to be 

recovered and displayed in at least one of the VTR's 
trick-play modes. The reduced resolution image may be 

from the same channel or from a different channel and may 
also be displayed as an inset picture (PIX-IN-PIX) in the 

main high-definition image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns high definition
television receivers and in particular a receiver which
processes a received high definition video signal to
produce data representing both a high resolution image
and a low resolution image for recording by a VCR.Digital high definition television production
schemes have been under development for several years.
These schemes typically produce higher quality television
images and sound than conventional television systems.
To do this, these systems convey more information than is
conveyed in a conventional television signal. Recent regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), however, require that
this larger amount of information be sent within the same
band of frequencies as a conventional television signal.
To fit the relatively large bandwidth High Definition
Television (HDTV) signal into a standard television
channel, the information content of the HDTV signal must
be compressed.Because of the relatively large degree of
spatial redundancy and temporal redundancy in the HDTV
signals, relatively high levels of data compression can
be achieved for most television signals.One such compression method, by which spatial
redundancy is removed from a television signal, generates
discrete cosine transform representations of blocks of
the image. This representation resolves an image frame
into coefficient values representing its various spatial
frequency components. Portions of an image which are the
same from pixel to pixel or which exhibit a repetitive
pattern are resolved from many pixel values to a
relatively small number of frequency coefficient values.
In addition, since the human eye is less sensitive to
quantization errors in image components having high
spatial frequencies than in image components having
relatively low spatial frequencies, the high spatial
frequency coefficients may be quantized more coarsely
than the low spatial frequency coefficients to further
reduce the amount of data used to represent the image.Temporal redundancy in an image may be removed
by encoding only the areas of a given frame which are
different from corresponding areas of a previously
encoded frame. This is generally known as predictive
coding. Temporal redundancy can be further exploited to
achieve even higher levels of data compression by
performing motion compensation. Using this scheme, 
before a image block is encoded, the blocks surrounding
it in a previously encoded frame are searched for the one
block which most closely matches the block in
