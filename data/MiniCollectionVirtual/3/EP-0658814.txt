<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is constituted by disposing a photosensitive layer on 

a support. The photosensitive layer contains 
oxytitanium phthalocyanine and a specific disazo 

pigment of the formula (I) or (II) each characterized 
by having particular coupler residues. The 

photosensitive layer may preferably include a charge 
generation layer and a charge transport layer. The 

charge generation layer may preferably include a first 
charge generation layer containing the above disazo 

pigment of the formula (I) or (II) and a second charge 
generation layer containing the above oxytitanium 

phthalocyanine. The electrophotographic 
photosensitive member including the photosensitive 

layer described above is usable for providing an 
apparatus unit and an electrophotographic apparatus

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic photosensitive (or
electrophotosensitive) member, an electrophotographic
apparatus including the photosensitive member and an
electrophotographic apparatus unit including the
photosensitive member.In organic electrophotosensitive members
comprising a photosensitive layer containing an
organic photoconductor, there have been used so-called
function separation-type electrophotosensitive members
having a lamination structure of a charge generation
layer containing a charge-generating material and a
charge transport layer containing a charge-transporting
material in many cases. The function
separation-type electrophotosensitive members have
provided remarkably improved electrophotographic
characteristics such as a high sensitivity and an
excellent durability, thus being widely put into
practical use.Particularly, in recent years, there have
been widely popularized non-impact type printers
utilizing electrophotography as a terminal printer 
instead of conventional impact-type printers. These
printers are laser beam printers using lasers as a
light source in general. As the light source,
semiconductor lasers are generally used in view of
cost, apparatus size, etc. Semiconductor lasers
generally used at present have a relatively longer
wavelength (i.e., emission wavelength:
780 ± 20 nm), so that electrophotosensitive members
having a sufficient sensitivity to laser light showing
such a longer wavelength have been studied and
developed.There have been studied and proposed many
charge-generating materials having a high sensitivity
to long-wavelength light, among which phthalocyanine
compounds such as non-metallic phthalocyanine, copper
phthalocyanine and oxytitanium phthalocyanine
(hereinbelow, abbreviated as "TiOPc").Particularly, oxytitanium phthalocyanine
(TiOPc) shows a very high photosensitive
characteristic and has various crystal forms similarly
as in other phthalocyanine compounds. Further,
electrophotographic characteristics of TiOPc vary
depending upon a difference in crystal form, so that
many types of TiOPcs having various crystal forms have
been studied and proposed. Representative examples
thereof may include: α-type TiOPc as disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 61-239248 
(corr. to U.S. Patent 4,728,592), β-type TiOPc as
disclosed in JP-A 62-67094 (U.S. Patent 4,664,977),
I-type TiOPc as disclosed in JP-A 3-128973 and Y-type
TiOPc as disclosed in JP-A 3-200790.However, not all conventional
electrophotosensitive members
