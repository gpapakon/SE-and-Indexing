<ABSTRACT>
The shelf-stability of biological products is enhanced by subjecting 
the product to a pressure and decreasing the pressure rapidly so that 

cell walls of contaminating organisms are ruptured. The product may 
optionally be blanched or milled, decrease in pressure may be effected 

by passing the product through a homogenizing valve. A preferred product 
is carrot root material. The treated product is prevented from 

re-contamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
According to the invention there is provided a method of enhancing the shelf-stability 
of a biological product by subjecting it to a decreasing pressure, characterised in 
that the decreasing pressure is achieved by passing the product through a homogenising 
valve, such that the decreasing pressure is sufficiently rapid to cause rupturing of the cell 
walls of contaminating organisms in the product, and in that it includes thereafter 
keeping the product from re-contamination by such organisms. The pressure in the product may be decreased in the homogenising valve from at 
least about 400 bar down to atmospheric pressure. The cellular burst technique utilised (i.e. the rapid reduction in pressure), in 
addition to diminishing or destroying altogether the viability of the contaminating 
organisms in the product, also causes rupturing of the cell walls of the biological product 
itself, and this has the effect of inactivating or otherwise controlling certain biochemical 
and non-biochemical reactions that are supported by intact cells of the product and that 
cause quality degradation and other undesirable changes in the product. The product may be blanched prior to its being subjected to said rapidly 
decreasing pressure. The blanched product may be milled prior to its being subjected to said rapidly 
decreasing pressure. The product may be kept from re-contamination by a process selected from the 
group of processes consisting of: packaging the product under aseptic conditions in 
aseptic packaging; freezing the product and keeping it in a frozen condition; and drying 
the product and packaging the dried product in moisture impermeable packaging. The product may be a vegetable product, and more particularly a carotene rich 
vegetable product. The product may be carrot root material.  
 Further according to the invention there is provided apparatus for enhancing the 
shelf-stability of a biological product, comprising treatment means for subjecting the 
product to a decreasing pressure, characterised in that the treatment means comprises a 
homogeniser including a homogenising valve through which the product can be passed, 
thereby subjecting the product to a decreasing pressure which is sufficiently rapid to 
cause rupturing of the cell walls of contaminating organisms in the product, to provide a 
treated product, and in that it further comprises post-treatment means for turning the 
treated product under aseptic conditions into a condition in which it is protected against 
re-contamination by
