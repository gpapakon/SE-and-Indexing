<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to warm air frost
control systems. More particularly, this invention relates
to a frost controlled door and a frost control method for discharging heated air at the
bottom portion of the frost controlled door and
advantageously inhibits the formation of frost on upper
portions of the frost controlled door by means of
convection forces.Large scale cold-storage lockers have been devised in
order to accommodate the large capacity storage needs of
the food industry. These lockers must accommodate the
access needs of the user. As such these lockers are
constructed with openings which can be easily opened and
closed as well as provide an adequate barrier between the
cold air compartment of the locker and the outside
environment.In order to provide easy access to a cold-storage
locker compartment, various door systems have been devised
depending upon the space requirements and the preferences
of the user. These doors can be folding doors which are
drawn laterally in a manner similar to curtains in the
home. Others slide vertically in a manner analogous to the
opening and closing of typical sliding garage doors while
still other doors are mounted upon a vertical axis and
swing open and close in the same manner as a gate. These
are of course only a few examples of the many types of
freezer access doors known to those skilled in the art.A common problem associated with the aforementioned
freezer door systems, regardless of their method of opening
and closing, is the tendency of moisture to condense on the
warm air side of the moveable freezer door. The 
condensation may drip to the floor of the freezer entrance
resulting in a hazardous surface for persons entering and
leaving the cold-storage locker. Frequently, the
condensation freezes upon the hinges and other surfaces of
the freezer door as well as surfaces adjacent to the door
such as the floor. The accumulated frost hampers the
opening and closing of the entrance to the cold-storage
locker. Frosted or iced transparent door panels or windows
obstruct vision to the other side of the door creating a
safety hazard for persons entering and leaving the storage
locker. Freezing of the joints presents the danger of
locking the joints of the door. Attempts to free the
locked joints may damage the freezer door. Therefore, it
is advantageous to include a frost control system to
prevent the condensation of water vapor upon the outer
surface of the door, keep the door frost-free, maintain
clear visibility through transparent portions of

<CLAIMS>
A frost controlled door for a doorway to a cold
storage area, comprising:


a door member (8) movable relative to the doorway
between opened and closed positions, and including

a top (16), a base, first and second side edges
(12, 14);
a duct system for controlling frost on and adjacent
the door member (8) and including an opening

for receiving a volume of air from the vicinity of
the door member (8), a heating element (30) for applying

heat to at least a portion of the volume of
air to create a volume of warmed air, a discharge

aperture (36) disposed adjacent to one of the first
and second side edges (12, 14) of the door member

(8), and a means (20, 22, 26) for conveying air from
the opening to the discharge aperture (36) such that at least

a portion of the volume of warmed air is discharged
horizontally toward the door member surface from the

discharge aperture (36).
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein said
duct system includes at least one discharge aperture

disposed adjacent to the other of the first and second
side edges of said door member.
The frost controlled door of claim 2, wherein said
duct system includes a first section and a second

section respectively disposed adjacent to said first 
and second side edges of the door member, each

section including at least one discharge aperture.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein at
least one aperture is disposed adjacent a relatively

lower portion of said door member.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein an
opening for receiving a volume of air is disposed

proximate the top of said door member.
The frost controlled door of claim 2, further comprising
a second blower, said first and second blowers

causing a volume of air moving in the duct
system to be delivered to discharge apertures at the

respective first and second side edges.
The frost controlled door of claim 6, wherein said
first and second blowers are respectively disposed

proximate said first and second side edges.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein the
discharge aperture emits the warmed volume of air at

an angle of approximately 15 degrees-from-parallel
to the door member surface.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein the at
least one heating element includes a heater strip

having a plurality of fins disposed perpendicular to
the flow direction of said volume of air over said

heater strip.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein the at
least one heating element includes a heater strip

having a plurality of fins disposed in parallel to
the flow direction of said volume of air over said

heater strip. 
The frost controlled door of claim 1, further comprising
a thermostatic control circuit including a

thermostatic switch which closes and enables energising
of said frost control system when air temperature

proximate a door member surface falls below
a first threshold and wherein the closed thermostatic

switch opens when an air temperature proximate
the door member exceeds a second threshold.
The frost controlled door of claim 11, wherein said
air temperature is sensed from said volume of air

entering an opening in the duct system.
The frost controlled door of claim 12, wherein said
first threshold equals 7,77 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit).
The frost controlled door of claim 13 wherein said
second threshold equals 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).
The frost controlled door of claim 1, further comprising
a radiant heater disposed above and in front

of the door member surface.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, wherein said
duct system further includes at least one opening

for directing a portion of the warmed volume of air
toward the floor beneath the door member.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, further comprising
a set of air suction openings disposed adjacent

to the other of the first and second edges for
enhancing the lateral flow of said warm volume of

air emitted from the at least one discharge aperture
toward said door member surface.
The frost controlled door of claim 1, further comprising
nozzles coupled to said one or more air discharge

apertures for directing said warmed volume of 
air in a direction having at least a substantial

horizontal component.
A method of frost control to reduce frost formation
on a cold storage locker door, said method comprising

the steps of:

withdrawing a volume of air from the vicinity of
the door (8),
warming the volume of air to create a volume of
warmed air, and
discharging the warmed volume of air horizontally
toward a door surface from at least one aperture

(36) disposed adjacent to a side edge (12; 14)
of the door (8).
