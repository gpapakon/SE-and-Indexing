<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fly wheel arrangement comprising a rotatable axle, a 
ring essentially forming the rotating mass of the fly wheel and a connecting means 
having essentially the shape of a cylinder or a conical shell and being made from 
fibre-reinforced plastics connecting the ring with the axle or with a part rotating 
herewith, the connecting means being glued to the ring at its outer end portion 
and to the axle or a part connected hereto at its inner end portion. Such a fly 
wheel arrangement is known from DK-B-160 637. DK-B-160.637 discloses a fly wheel, wherein the connecting means has a platelike, 
cross-sectional low U shape. The known fly wheel arrangement comprises 
two or four such connecting means grouped in pairs, each being glued to the ring 
and a hub wedged on the axle at their inner and outer end portions, respectively. 
During rotation of the fly wheel the ring generates strong centrifugal forces, and 
if the fly wheel is placed in moving transport means, such as airplanes or vehicles, 
the fly wheel arrangement is also subjected to a strong gyroscopic torque. 
The above mentioned forces in particular make heavy demands on the inner glued 
joints between the connecting means and the hub. The expansion of the ring produced 
by the centrifugal forces results in large angular displacements in the connecting 
means and as a result hereof corresponding high stresses. As indicated 
above these stresses in particular may cause problems at the inner glued joints 
with the hub. JP, A, 63-125841 discloses a fly wheel arrangement having a connection means 
in the shape of a conical shell which is connected to a ring-shaped rotating mass 
at its outer end portion and to a hub at its inner end portion.  
 The object of the invention is to provide a fly wheel arrangement of the above 
type, wherein the stresses in the connecting means and in particular in the connection 
between the latter and the axle is reduced in relation to prior art. The fly wheel arrangement according to the invention is characterised in that the 
inner glued joint between the axle and the connecting means is arranged at a 
diameter at least three times the bearing diameter of the axle. As a gyroscopic 
torque at any point causes forces in the joint which are inversely proportional to 
the square of the distance of the point from the axis of rotation, the joint may advantageously 
be placed as far away from the axis of rotation as possible. According to the invention, the connecting means may comprise fibres
