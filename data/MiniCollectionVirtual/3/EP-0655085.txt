<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid detergent composition 
comprising certain β-aminoalkylboronic acids or esters (see compound 
structure below) as protease inhibitors, protease, and detersive 
surfactant. Protease-containing liquid detergent compositions are well known. 
A commonly encountered problem, particularly with heavy duty liquid 
laundry detergents, is the degradation by protease enzyme of second 
enzymes in the composition, such as lipase, amylase and cellulase. The 
performance of the second enzyme upon storage and its stability in 
product are thus impaired by the presence of protease in the liquid 
detergent product. EP 478 050 discloses detergent compositions comprising a lipolytic enzyme 
and a stabilising material capable of reversibly forming a complex with 
the active site of the lipolytic enzyme. Boronic acid derivatives are 
said to be advantageous stabilising materials for said lipase materials. Boronic acids are known to reversibly inhibit protease. This 
inhibition of protease by boronic acid is reversible upon dilution, as 
occurs in wash water. It is difficult to find an effective reversible protease inhibitor 
which is stable over time in a liquid detergent product. A search for 
a boronic acid which is a good reversible serine protease inhibitor and 
does not lose efficacy in product over time has now led to the 
synthesis of a novel compound of the structure described below. A new 
method for synthesizing β-aminoalkyl and β-N-peptidylaminoalkylboronic 
acids is also described below. Lastly, a new use for the subject 
compound or its derivatives as an effective serine protease inhibitor 
in a liquid detergent composition containing serine protease is 
described below. Certain boronic acids are cited as subtilisin inhibitors in 
Phillip, M. and Bender, N.L., "Kinetics of Subtilisin and 
Thiosubtillsin", Molecular & Cellular Biochemistry, vol. 51, pp. 5-32 
(1983), and in Phillip, M. and S. Maripuri, "Inhibition of Subtilisin  
 
by Substituted Arylboronic Acids FEBS Letters, vol. 133(1), pp. 36-38 
(October, 1981). Many of these inhibitors, however, are arylboronic 
acids, which owing to protodeboronation may not be stable under the 
slightly alkaline conditions found in many liquid detergents. It is 
believed that alkylboronic acids, particularly those with atoms other 
than hydrogen on the α carbon, may not possess the desired stability 
due to autoxidation as discussed by Johnson, J., Van Campen, M., and 
Grummitt, 0., Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 60,
