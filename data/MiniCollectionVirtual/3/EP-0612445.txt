<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an intelligent lamp or an intelligent contact terminal for a lamp, which can be used in a lighting system comprising a plurality of individually controlled lamps (1; 5) linked in a common power-supply circuit (8, 9) and an operation control device for transmitting a desired operation control signal to electronic control elements (11, 12, 13), associated with the lamp or the contact terminal and reacting or failing to react selectively to various control signals. Together with the lamp or its contact terminal, said electronic control elements (11, 12, 13) provide a single replaceable component which, on the basis of a message included in the operation control signal, identifies itself to serve as an appropriate lamp. In addition, the electronic control elements (2; 6) monitor the condition of itself and that of the lamp and, if necessary, produce a fault indication.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intelligent lamp or an intelligent contact
terminal for a lamp for use in a lighting system, comprising a plurality of
individually controlled lamps linked in one and the same power-supply circuit
and an operation control device for transmitting a desired operation control
signal to electronics control elements which are included in the lamp or the
contact terminal and which selectively react or fail to react to various control
signals.The above type of lighting systems have been earlier proposed e.g. in European
Patent publications EP-0 217 762 and EP-0 430 792. This type of lighting
systems is particulary suitable for use as an automotive lighting system, an
essential benefit gained over the traditional systems being that all lamps can be
connected in a conductor series, including e.g. two or three conductors. This
system will be more simple and inexpensive as the number of conductors is
substantially reduced. The number of connections is also reduced. In these
prior known lighting control systems, however, the lamp or its contact terminal
is not provided with electronics facilitating the independent intelligent"
operation thereof for fully exploiting the benefits of the system.German Patent application DE-A-3 041 896
discloses an intelligent lamp according to the preamble of claim 1 and an intelligent contact
terminal according to the preamble of claim 2. An object of the invention is to provide a new type of intelligent lamp or an
intelligent contact terminal for a lamp, comprising a replaceable standard
component which nevertheless includes a sufficient amount of operational
intelligence for bringing the entire system with its variety of differently
operating lamps into a condition more standardized than before. The object of the invention is achieved by means of an intelligent lamp as set out in claim 1.Alternatively, the object of the invention is also achieved by means of an intelligent contact
terminal as set out in claim 2. The intelligent contact terminal of the present invention can be used in a
lighting system of a vehicle, the features of the lighting system being defined
in the enclosed claim 10. A few exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be
described in more detail with reference made to the
accompanying drawings, in which
fig. 1 shows a block diagram as an example of an electric
circuit for embodying an intelligent lamp or
contact terminal;  fig. 2 illustrates various control and operating
conditions A-D for an intelligent lamp or a
