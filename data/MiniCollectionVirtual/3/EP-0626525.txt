<ABSTRACT>
A friction element (10) comprises a backing plate 
(12), and a block (14) of friction material which has a 

groove (22) therein to indicate wear. The groove (22) is 
formed between two indentations (24) in the block (14). 

The indentations (24) are formed by projections (40) into 
a layer (30) of particulate material from which the block 

(14) is formed. The indentations (24) have curved side 
walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method of 
manufacturing a friction element, eg a brake pad, and with 
a friction element itself. Friction elements in the form of brake pads usually 
comprise a backing plate and a block of friction material 
mounted on the backing plate. The block may incorporate an 
underlayer which engages the backing plate and may have 
projections which project into apertures in the backing 
plate to assist in securing the block to the backing plate. 
It is common practice to provide such blocks with at least 
one groove which has an opening defined by an upper surface 
of the block and extends across the block between points on 
opposite side surfaces thereof. Such grooves are provided 
to indicate the wear of the block and do not extend to the 
full depth of the block. Thus, such grooves are cut to a 
constant depth in such blocks so that by observing the 
remaining depth of groove it is possible to ascertain the 
wear which has occurred in service. Conventionally, such 
blocks are formed on the backing plate by assembling a 
layer of particulate material in contact with the backing 
plate in a die cavity. The particulate material contains 
a curable binder and is compacted against the backing plate 
to form an uncured block. Subsequent curing of the binder 
completes the block. The afore-mentioned grooves are 
formed by making saw cuts downwardly from the upper surface 
of the block, ie the surface away from the backing plate.  The conventional method of forming the grooves of a 
friction element, referred to above, results in grooves 
which have jagged edges at the ends thereof where the saw 
blade has entered and left the sides of the block. Such 
ragged edges are found to provide starting points for 
cracks while the friction element is in service, such 
cracks possibly resulting in failure of the element. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method of manufacturing a friction element having a groove 
of the afore-mentioned type in which the formation of 
ragged edges as described above is avoided. The invention provides a method of manufacturing a 
friction element which comprises a backing plate, and a 
block of friction material mounted on the backing plate, 
said block having a lower surface which extends parallel to 
the backing plate and is secured thereto, an upper surface 
which extends parallel to the lower surface and provides a 
friction surface of the element, and side surfaces which 
interconnect said upper and lower surfaces, the block 
defini

A method of manufacturing a friction element (10) 
which comprises a backing plate (12), and a block (14) 

of friction material mounted on the backing plate, 
said block having a lower surface (16) which extends 

parallel to the backing plate and is secured thereto, 
an upper surface (18) which extends parallel to the 

lower surface and provides a friction surface of the 
element, and side surfaces (20) which interconnect 

said upper and lower surfaces, the block defining at 
least one groove (22) which has an opening defined by 

said upper surface (18) and extends across the block 
between points on opposite side surfaces thereof, the 

method comprising assembling a layer of particulate 
material (30) in contact with a backing plate (12) in 

a die cavity (32), the die cavity having a bounding 
wall (34) defining a periphery of said layer and 

arranged to define said side surfaces of the block 
(20), the particulate material comprising frictional 

fillers and a curable binder, characterised in that 
said bounding wall (34) defines projections (40) 

having curved sides which project into said layer (30) 
at points corresponding to said points on opposite 

side surfaces of the block, the method also comprising 
moving a punch (36) into said cavity (32) thereby 

compacting said layer (30) against the backing plate 
(12) and forming a block of uncured friction material 

with indentations in side surfaces thereof caused by 
the projections (40), curing said binder, and cutting 

away material from between said indentations to form 
said groove (22). 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the material is cut away by sawing. 
A friction element (10) which comprises a backing 
plate (12), and a block (14) of friction material 

mounted on the backing plate, said block having a 
lower surface (16) which extends parallel to the 

backing plate and is secured thereto, an upper surface 
(18) which extends parallel to the lower surface and 

provides a friction surface of the element, and side 
surfaces (20) which interconnect said upper and lower 

surfaces, the block defining at least one groove (22) 
which has an opening defined by said upper surface 

(18) and extends across the block between points on 
opposite side surfaces thereof, characterised in that 

said groove (22) extends between indentations (24) in 
said side surfaces, said indentations (24) having 

curved side walls.
