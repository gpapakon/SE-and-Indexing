<ABSTRACT>
In order optically to determine the concentration of solid particles contained in water such as effluent water (sewage), the sludge content and the residual turbidity of the water are measured simultaneously, but separately of one another, by means of scattered light generated by a light source. The measured values detected in this case are evaluated jointly.

Method of optically determining the concentration of solid particles
contained in water, such as for example waste water, comprising the

steps:

a) light is produced by only one light source in a housing of a probe (10)
provided with only two windows (3,6),
b) the light from this source is directed so that it passes from the probe
through the first window (3) into the water,
c) the light is scattered back in the water and thereby passes back through
the two windows (3,6) into the probe,
d) behind each of the two windows (3, 6) is a respective detector (7, 8)
for measuring the respective incident light, so that the 90° scattered light

method is combined with the back scattered light method,
e) the measured values obtained by the two detectors are evaluated in
common.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to Claim 1

a) with only one light source (1) in the housing (9) of a probe (10),
b) the housing (9) has only two windows (3, 6),
c) means (2) are provided for guiding the light so that the light leaves the
probe through the first window (3),
d) behind each of the two windows (3, 6) is a respective detector (7, 8)
for measuring the respective incident light, mounted so that the 90°

scattered light method can be combined with the back scattered light
method,
e) the two detectors are connected to an evaluating unit present in the
probe, and evaluate jointly the measured values obtained by the two

detectors.
Apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the two outputs
of the two detectors (7, 8) are connected to a common microcomputer

(23).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the
two windows are able to be cleaned by a common wiper (13).
