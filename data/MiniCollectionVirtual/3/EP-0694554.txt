<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing cyclic organohydrogen-
siloxanes is described. It comprises contacting an

organohydrogendichlorosilane with about a stoichiometric
equivalent of water to form a hydrolyzate. The hydrolyzate

is then diluted in an inert solvent and contacted with an
acidic rearrangement catalyst to effect formation of cyclic

organohydrogensiloxanes. The cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes
are subsequently separated from inert solvent and linear

organohydrogensiloxanes. The inert solvent and linear
organohydrogensiloxanes are later recycled to the process

for further contact with the acidic rearrangement catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for preparing
cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes. The process comprises
contacting an organohydrogendichlorosilane with about a
stoichiometric equivalent of water to form a hydrolyzate.
The hydrolyzate is diluted in an inert solvent and contacted
with an acidic rearrangement catalyst to effect formation of
cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes.Cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes, such as cyclic
methylhydrogensiloxane, are useful as crosslinkers in
silicone coatings and encapsulating materials for the
electronics industry and are also intermediates to form SiH
functional siloxanes. In typical preparation processes, a
first step involves the hydrolysis of an organohydrogendichlorosilane
to form an equilibrium mixture containing
cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes and short-chain linear
organohydrogensiloxanes. Generally, the weight percent of
cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes in the equilibrium mixture is
small in relation to the weight percent of linear
organohydrogensiloxanes present. Consequently, when demand
for cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes is high, an excess of
linear organohydrogensiloxanes may result.Therefore, it is an object of this invention to
provide a method to increase the proportion of cyclic
organohydrogensiloxane species in an equilibrium mixture.
Another objective is to provide a method where the linear
species recovered from the equilibrium mixture is recycled
to the process for further conversion to cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes.
A final objective is to provide a
process where hydroxyl substitution on the silicon of the
cyclic and linear species is minimized. This is necessary
to prevent gelling of the linear species during conduct of 
the process and to provide cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes of
consistent reactivity for use in other processes.The prior art is represented by Sokolov et al.,
All-Union Electrotechnical Institute, March 5, 1955, p.
1061-1063, which teaches the reaction of methydichlorosilane
with water to form cyclic methylhydrogensiloxanes.Numerous procedures have been reported in the art
for improving the yield of cyclic organohydrogensiloxanes
from hydrolysis processes similar to that taught by Sokolov
et al.U. S. Patent 3,590,064 discloses that halogen
endblocked linear polysiloxanes can be reacted with at least
a stoichiometric amount of an alkali metal carbonate salt in
the present of a suitable polar solvent to form cyclic
organopolysiloxanes. That process is suitable for forming
cyclic organopolysiloxanes having hydrogen bonded to
silicon.U. S.
