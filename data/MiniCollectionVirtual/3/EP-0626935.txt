Process for the separation of a feed stream 
essentially comprising hydrogen, methane and C₃/C₄-hydrocarbons 

which has previously passed through a 
dehydrogenation (pretreatment), after which the feed 

stream experiences an at least single-stage partial 
condensation and separation into a C₃/C₄-hydrocarbon-rich 

fraction and an H₂/CH₄-fraction, whereupon a part-stream 
of the H₂/CH₄ fraction is mixed with the still unpretreated 

feed stream, 
characterized in that
 the H₂/CH₄ 
gas fraction taken off from the first separator (S1) is 

divided into two part-streams (10, 17), the first part-stream 
(10) together with the liquid fraction (11) of the 

first separator (S1) being fed after partial condensation 
(W2) to a second separator (S2), the C₃/C₄-hydrocarbon-rich 

liquid fraction (16) taken off at the bottom of the 
second separator (S2) being passed into a stripper column 

(S3) together with the second part-stream of the H₂/CH₄ 
gas fraction (17) from the first separator (S1), in that 

at the top of the second separator an H₂-rich gas fraction 
having high purity (13) is taken off and after 

vaporizing in heat exchange (W2) against process streams 
to be cooled is mixed with the feed stream before 

pretreatment of the feed stream (2, 2a, 2b) and in that 
at the bottom of the stripper column (S3) a C₃/C₄-rich 

product fraction (20) is taken off and at the head of the 
stripper column (S3) an H₂-rich gas fraction having
 less 
high purity (18) is taken off.  

 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the H₂-rich gas fraction having high purity (13) 

taken off at the top of the second separator (S2) is 
expanded (T1) in a manner producing refrigeration 

capacity. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the mixing of the H₂-rich gas 

fraction having high purity (13), taken off at the top of 
the second separator (S2), with the feed stream 

(2, 2a, 2b) is carried out at at least two different 
temperature levels. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an H₂-rich gas fraction is taken 

off below the top of the stripper column (S3), partially 
condensed and reapplied to the top of the column (S3) 

above the take-off point.
