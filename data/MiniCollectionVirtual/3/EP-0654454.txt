<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a core-shell polymer powder produced by a 
two-stage aqueous emulsion sequential process which is particularly useful as an 

acrylic modifier for cementitious materials such as, for example, tile thinset mortar, 
waterproofing slurry, patching, adhesives for insulation foam, and flooring 

compound. 
The core-shell polymer powders of this invention have excellent physical 
properties and, when used as a cement modifier, provide excellent mortar properties 

in thin section application; provide adhesion to a variety of substrates; and provide 
improved mortar flexibility in dry and wet environments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a core-shell polymer powder. The core-shell 
polymer powder is produced by a two-stage aqueous emulsion sequential process 
and is particularly useful as an acrylic modifier for cementitious materials such as, 
for example, tile thinset mortar, waterproofing slurry, patching, adhesive for 
insulation foam, and flooring compound. In order to achieve maximum utility, i.e. trouble-free, long-term service from 
the installation of ceramic and stone-ware tiles, polymers employed in the tile 
mortar must be capable of adapting to high humidity environments, various 
surfacing materials and a variety of substrates, while performance requirements, 
such as, flexibility, impact resistance, wear, and water sensitivity, are maintained. Today's market requires a variety of ceramic tiles to be applied using 
polymers which are flexible and capable of absorbing differential movements 
between the tile and a variety of substrates. For example, ceramic tiles must be 
installed directly over partially cured or lightweight concrete, pre-cast concrete 
slabs, asphalt, plywood, dry wall panels and other non-traditional substrates. Originally, two systems provided the required degree of flexibility: ready-to-use 
adhesive paste-type systems and chemical reactive adhesives-type systems. 
Ready-to-use adhesives, although flexible, are generally extremely water sensitive 
and cannot be used in exterior installations, and they are not useful in situations 
where they are constantly immersed below water, such as pools, fountains and 
Jacuzzis®. Chemical reactive adhesives systems, although very flexible, are 
generally two-component systems which require proper mixing before use. Also, 
chemical adhesive systems are not environmentally friendly and require adequate 
ventilation during both installation and curing. What is required is a single package, polymer-modified Portland cement 
mortar which adheres to non-traditional substrates, which is environmentally 
friendly, which is flexible, impact and wear resistant, while chemical and physical 
properties, such as water resistance, are maintained. DE 40 21 216 A1 discloses an aqueous polymer dispersion containing a film-forming 
dispersion polymer as the dispersed phase, and a fully, or partially 
neutralized, water-soluble copolymer in the aqueous phase consisting of an 
olefinically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, C₃-C₁₂ alkenes, and addition free-radical 
polymerizable monomers. This dispersion is subsequently converted to powder 
form.  JP
