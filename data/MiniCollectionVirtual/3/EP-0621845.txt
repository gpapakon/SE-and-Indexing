<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method and a device for applying self adhesive labels onto sacks having filling tubes, and to a conveyor especially designed to allow a label application also onto the bottom side of the continuously conveyed sacks. The invention is characterized in that a label (3) carried on an elastically resilient web at an applicator means (1) is applied onto a sack (12) during the feeding of the sack on a conveyor (10), the applicator means being movable to a label application position where the elastically resilient web at the applicator means and the label will take the form of the contour of the sack and adhere to the surface of the sack.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Technique for Application of Labels.This invention relates to a method and to a device for application of self adhesive labels onto sacks having filling tubes, and further to a ■* conveyor especially designed to allow a label application also to the bottom side of a continously conveyed sack. ""•i To be able to fill the sacks with bulk material in a rational way a filling tube is often used in connection to one of the corners of the sack. This tube is folded and sealed after the filling. The impenetra¬ bility and the safety of the sealing methods used today are not satisfactory in sackfilling of e.g. corrosive bulk material as e.g. meta silicate, or of other dusting material as cement and ceramic materials. This is especially the case with smaller sacks where the filling tube is short making the sealing action inadequate. Besides giving a defective closure the existing closure methods are also very slow, among other things depending upon that the sacks often have to stand still for some seconds the closure performance. This means that a closuring capacity of just about 150 sacks/hour is common. Sealings with melt¬ ing glue cannot be used together with various existing bulk material as a chemical reaction can occur between the bulk material and the melting glue/heat. Moreover melting glue cannot be brought to the corner tips of the sack- in a simple way to assist in forming a complete closure.Pre-glued sacks , i.e. sacks where glue strings are applied at one corner portion of the sack at the manufacturing of the sack, is often more expensive than conventional sacks and moreover they demand a special equipment to heaten the pre-glued portion, or in some other way carry out the closure of the pre-glued sack.Furthermore there is a demand from shipping autorities and from transport organizations that bulk material harmful to the environ¬ ment shall be properly packed.The main object of this invention is to obtain a method and a device to both rapidly (up to 1.000 sacks/hour), safely, exactly and * continously apply self adhesive labels onto sacks with filling tubes.An other object of the invention is to obtain a closure technique which is not sensitive to different forms of the sack by being automatically adapted to these forms and also seal e.g. that part of the corner portion of the sack normally resting on the conveyor. 

 According to this invention these objects are obtained by the method and the device having the characterizing clauses mentioned in the claims.By letting the label being carried onto an

CLAIMS
1. A method to continously apply self adhesive labels onto sacks with filling tubes, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that a label (3) carried on an elastically resilient web at an applicator means (1) is applied onto a sack (12) during the feeding of the sack on a conveyor (10), the applicator means being movable to a label application position where the elastically resilient web at the applicator means and the label take the form after the contour of the sack and adher to the surface of the sack.
2. Method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the whole corner portion of the sack (12) is exposed during feeding onto the conveyor, the applicator means being arranged to also apply the label onto that side of the sack which former rested on the conveyor web.
3. Method according to claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that each label (3) is loosened from the label web (4) by bringing the latter round a knife edge at the same time as air from an air nozzle (8) blows onto the adhesive side of the label in assisting in separating the label from the label web and in steering onto the applicator means (1).
4. Metod according to claim 1, 2 or 3, c h a r a c t er i z e d i n that the label (3) is hold on the applicator means (1) with aid of vaccum.
5. Device for continously applying self adhesive labels onto sacks with filling tubes and to perform the method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n a label recieving applicator means (1) with an elastically resilient web which together with the label is adaptable to the shape of each specific sack (12).
6. Device according to claim 5, c h ar a c t e r i z e d i n that the applicator means (1) has a rubber web (2) being stretched over a rearwardly open frame portion. 


 7. Device according-tcr claim 6, c h ar-a c ter i z e d in that the applicator means (1) has upper and lower guiding plates (14a, 14b) forming a pressure onto the sack at the press against the surface thereof and onto the intermediate label (3) when the sack temporarily and partially is separated from the conveyor.
8. Device according to claim 6, c h ar ac teri z e d in that the vaccum conduits (9) end in the rubber web (2) and constitute vaccum holding the self adhesive label (3) onto the applicator means (1).
9. Conveyor for use in performing the method according to claim 1 during use of the device according to claim 5, c h ar a c t e r i z e d i n that the sack moving web of the conveyor is temporarily bent down from a normal transferring level to allow a portion of the sack to temporarily leave the ordinary web.
10. Conveyor according to claim 9, c h ar ac te r iz e d in that an assisting conveyor is arranged at a lower level and in a short distance from the ordinary web, wherein the label applicator means is arrang¬ ed to be brought against the corner portion of the sack at the space between the two webs.
