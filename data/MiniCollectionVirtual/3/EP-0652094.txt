<ABSTRACT>
A molding process for syndiotactic polypropylene includes 
holding the melt at a process temperature of about 27 to 

77°C to achieve a cycle time of less than 150°C and a haze 
value for a 2 mm thick article of less than 38%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
molding of plastic, and more particularly relates to
a process for molding syndiotactic polypropylene.Molding is a process in
which melted or plasticized polymeric material is forced
into a mold where it is held until removed in a solid state
having a shape which duplicates the cavity of the mold. The
process consists of three basic operations: (1) raising the
temperature of the plastic to a point where it will flow
under pressure into the mold cavity, (2) allowing the
plastic to solidify in the mold (conventionally referred to
as hold time) while maintaining pressure during removal of
heat, and (3) opening the mold to eject the plastic
permanently frozen in the shape of the mold. The
productivity of the molding operation depends on the speed
of melting the plastic, the speed of injection and ejection,
and the hold time required to cool and solidify the product
in the mold. Thus, in the molding art, cycle time is
defined as the time required for one complete operation of a
molding press from closing time to closing time. In most
molding operations, the largest part of the cycle time is
the hold time, which generally accounts for up to 80% of the
cycle time, and may be as high as 95%.Polypropylene (PP) has long been used in molding and
extruding operations for articles such as containers and
films for the food packaging industry, and is known to exist 
in three forms. In isotactic polypropylene (IPP), the
methyl groups are attached to the tertiary carbon atoms of
successive monomeric units on the same side of a
hypothetical plane through the polymer chain. Syndiotactic
polypropylene (SPP) has the methyl groups attached on
alternating sides of the polymer chain. Atactic
polypropylene (APP) has the methyl groups attached randomly
with respect to the polymer chain. APP is essentially a
waxy product of low melting point whereas SPP and IPP are
crystalline and of higher melting point.All conventional molding and extruding grades of PP are
substantially isotactic and are synthesized using Ziegler-Natta
polymerization catalysts. Depending on the particular
polymerization catalyst and conditions, these products may
contain limited amounts of monomeric units having other
configurations.SPP, although known for many years in various degrees of
syndiotactic purity, has been only a laboratory curiosity
until recently. A new crystalline SPP of exceptionally high
syndiotactic purity prepared by a process using
syndiospecific metallocene catalysts is disclosed by Ewen et
al. in US Patent No.

a temperature sufficient to keep said melt in the mold at a process temperature of 27 to

77°C;
b) holding said melt at said process temperature until it crystallizes into an
article having the shape of said mold; and
c) ejecting said article from said mold wherein process steps (a) and (b) are
complete in a cycle time of 150 sec. or less and said article has a haze value of 38% or

less.

when injected into said mold.
The process of Claim 1 wherein said melt includes a polymer additive.
The process of Claim 3 wherein said additive is selected from the group
consisting of a radiation stabilizer, filler, coloring agent, anti-static material, wetting

agent and nucleator.
The process of claim 1 wherein in step (a) the mold is maintained at a
temperature sufficient to keep said melt in the mold at a process temperature of 49 to

77°C; and wherein process steps (a) and (b) are complete in a cycle time of 50 sec. or
less and said article has a haze value of 31% or less.
The process of claim 1 wherein in step (a) the mold is maintained at a
temperature sufficient to keep said melt in the mold at a process temperature of 49 to

70°C; and wherein process steps (a) and (b) are complete in a cycle time of 39 sec. or
less and said article has a haze value of 26% or less.
