<ABSTRACT>
To control the orientation of curative groups in 
an elastomer formulation, in order to maximize the 

properties obtained in the vulcanized elastomer, cure 
accelerators are deposited on the surface of a fiber. 

This method results in a fiber type orientation of 
crosslink sites in an elastomer matrix, resulting in 

enhanced modulus properties. An added benefit of the 
method is the chemical attachment of the fiber to the 

elastomer formulation, which also results in enhanced 
modulus properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to reinforcement of 
elastomeric materials, especially rubber formulations. Short fiber reinforcement in an elastomer results 
in increased modulus values, but lower break 
strengths. This is due to the poor adhesion between 
the fiber and the elastomer resulting in poor transfer 
of shear stresses between the rubber and the fiber. 
The poor adhesion is due to chemical and mechanical 
incompatibility between the fiber and the elastomer. Chemical incompatibility arises from polar 
(fiber) and non-polar (elastomer) interactions. This 
problem can be minimized by grafting the elastomer to 
the fiber. Mechanical incompatibility arises due to the 
large modulus differences between the fiber and the 
elastomer. Fibers, in general, have a very high 
modulus, and elastomers, comparatively, have a very 
low modulus. The large difference in modulus creates 
a weak interface between the fiber and the elastomer, 
and causes poor transfer of shear stresses which 
develop when an elastomer is compressed or stretched 
and rebounds. In accordance with the present 
invention, mechanical compatibility between an 
elastomer and a fiber embedded therein can be improved 
by creating a modulus gradient between the elastomer 
and the fiber. It is an object of this invention to improve the 
chemical and mechanical compatibility of an elastomer 
and its fiber reinforcement. It is also an object of  
 
this invention to provide modulus gradients in an 
elastomer matrix. Other objects of the invention will 
be apparent from the following description and claims. A method for forming domains of high density 
crosslinking in an elastomer matrix, and an elastomer 
matrix made using the method are provided as defined in the appended claims.  
 Chemical and mechanical interaction between an 
elastomer and fiber reinforcement can be improved by 
depositing cure accelerators, which increase the 
crosslinking in the elastomer, on the surface of the 
fibers used for reinforcement of the elastomer. In 
order to assure that the cure accelerators remain with 
the fibers during mixing of the fibers into the 
elastomer, it is desirable that the accelerators be 
bonded or attached to the fiber. Attachment of the 
accelerator to the fiber also makes possible the 
bonding of the fiber to the elastomer, through the 
accelerator. Improved bonding of fiber reinforcement 
to an elastomer increases the modulus and cut 
resistance of the elastomer. Since the accelerator increases the rate of 
crosslinking of a curable elastomer,
