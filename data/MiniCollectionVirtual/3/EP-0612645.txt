<ABSTRACT>
The air pressure brake is provided for rail tractive units with a further, preferably electric brake. In a brake pressure line (9, 10) it has a shut-off valve (5) with a 3/2-way valve (18) which when another brake is active vents the brake cylinder (13) of the air pressure brake despite its being actuated and thus keeps the air pressure brake unactivated; the shut-off valve (5) therefore exerts the function of a customary blending valve. In order to prevent complete brake failure if the 3/2-way valve (18) functions imperfectly, a bypass valve (48) is provided which only opens when rapid braking is applied to the air pressure brake and, bypassing the 3/2-way valve (18) permits compressed air to be applied to the brake cylinder (13). Possible flowing away of compressed air from the brake cylinder (13) through the 3/2-way valve (18) to the atmosphere is throttled here or completely prevented by a valve component which is associated with the bypass valve (48).

pressure in a main air line directly or indirectly to 

at least one brake cylinder (13) and the stop valve (5) 
comprising a 3/2 distributing valve (18), which in its 

switch position corresponding to the further brake 
being inoperative opens the passage through the brake 

pressure line (9, 10) and in its other switch position

valve (48) bridging the 3/2 distributing valve (18) is 

provided, which is only open during operation or 
driving of the compressed air brake exceeding the

of the switch status of the distributing valve (18),

which is tightly sealable by a valve seal (52) when the 
main air line pressure predominates on the piston (49).
