<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tungsten 
electrode material having satisfactory arc ignitability 
and exhaustion resistance of heat plasma, which is an 
electrode material capable of keeping these properties 
as an electrode for large current. An electrode material, including that for TIG 
welding, for arc or plasma arc must be excellent in arc 
ignitability and exhaustion resistance. While treated tungsten has long been used as an 
electrode material satisfying these conditions, tungsten 
added with lanthanum oxide, yttrium oxide or cerium 
oxide has now been employed. Various tungsten electrodes including those of the 
above-mentioned treated tungsten are materials excellent 
in arc ignitability and exhaustion resistance for such 
purposes as TIG welding, plasma flame spraying, and  
 
plasma cutting. These electrodes are manufactured from tungsten 
added with an oxide (thorium oxide, ThO₂, lanthanum 
oxide, La₂O₃, yttrium oxide, Y₂O₃, cerium oxide, CeO₂) in 
an amount within a range of from 1 to 4 wt.%, respectively. However, the above-mentioned ranges of practical 
application of tungsten electrodes cover welding, flame 
spraying and cutting, and the values of current used 
range from several amperes to several hundred amperes, 
or mostly up to 300 amperes in most uses. New technologies such as spray refining, molten 
steel heating and high-temperature combustion are 
recently being developed with the use of plasma arc in 
addition to these uses and conditions. In order to 
generate plasma arc for these purposes, electric power 
of a high current density is necessary. Use of the 
above-mentioned conventional electrodes for these 
purposes involves such problems that because of very 
serious wear, the object cannot be sufficiently achieved 
technologically as well as economically. Even among the conventional materials, those  
 
containing thorium oxide which is a radioactive substance 
poses the problems in labor safety and health 
such as health control of operators. Pollution of air 
by released gases is another important problem. Safer 
electrodes are thus required. To solve the above-mentioned problems, the present 
invention was completed on the basis of findings that a 
material prepared by adding lanthanum oxide in a slight 
amount to tungsten was excellent in arc ignitability and 
exhaustion resistance, as a result of studies carried 
out on various constituents. More particularly, the 
tungsten electrode material of the present invention 
comprises, in weight percentage, from 0.02% to
