<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent pad (100) for use with meat and 
poultry products in retail sale packages has a laminated 

tissue absorbent mat (104) sandwiched and sealed between 
upper and lower plastic sheets (102, 106). The pad (100) 

is perforated by penetration of perforating pins entirely 
through the pad to develop a series of holes (120) for the 

passage of liquid from the meat package into the absorbent 
mat (104) inside the pad. A myriad of outwardly 

projecting tufts of tissue material (130) are developed 
along the underside of the pad (100) by the perforating 

pins (204). These tufts (130) develop a wicking effect 
which enhances the capillary action of the tissue layers 

(108) inside the pad. Methods of fabrication of the 
individual pads and continuous linear absorbent sheet 

material are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to absorbent products 
and, more particularly, to such products which are used in 
packaging of meat products for absorbing liquids 
leaking therefrom, and to the method of, and apparatus for, their manufacture. Absorbent pads particularly designed for 
packaging with meats, poultry and fish food products 
are used in food markets, poultry processing plants 
and the like to reduce product display costs and to 
provide a cleaner, more attractive product. These 
pads are generally wrapped with the food product on 
the underside thereof to absorb liquids which may 
"bleed" from the product. In poultry products, for 
example, it is customary to place the poultry parts of 
a given package in a molded shallow tray of foamed 
plastic or the like. One of these absorbent pads is 
placed in the bottom of the tray and the poultry parts 
are placed thereon. The complete package is then 
wrapped with clear polyethylene or the like. In the poultry/meat pads which are known, a 
liquid absorbent mat or laminated tissue pad is placed 
within a plastic envelope or supported on a plastic 
layer which is perforated or otherwise rendered 
permeable to liquid. The liquid must pass through the 
plastic layer in order to reach the absorbent mat or 
pad contained therein. Once past the plastic layer, 
the liquid spreads throughout the absorbent pad by 
capillary action. However, such an arrangement is not  
 
always as effective as it might be. It is an object 
of this invention to provide an absorbent pad in which 
the effectiveness of the capillary action within the 
pad in the interior of a plastic envelope can be 
enhanced and extended to reach liquid outside the  
 
envelope. According to the present invention in one aspect, there is 
provided an absorbent product as defined in claim 1. A preferred embodiment of the invention provides an absorbent pad in the 
form of a plurality of laminated tissue layers mounted 
inside a plastic envelope. The plastic is perforated 
by inserting a plurality of pins from the upper side 
entirely through the pad so that a series of tufts of 
absorbent tissue protrude from the underside of the 
pad. The pad is marked in some fashion, such as by 
placing the notation "THIS SIDE UP" on the side into 
which the pins are inserted, so that in use as 
intended the tufted side is exposed to the liquid 
which bleeds from the meat, poultry or fish into the 
tray or other container. These individual tufts, 
although minuscule in scale, extend the absorbent 
material through the

absorbing liquids bleeding from food items
 
   the product having a core including a 

mat (104) of absorbent material, an upper sheet (102) 
and a lower sheet (106) situated on opposite sides of 

the mat (104) and having opposite edges (110, 112) 
which are sealed together to define an envelope 

encasing the core, characterized by the product being 
perforated with a plurality of perforations 

extending through both of the sheets and the mat, the 
perforations (120) forming inwardly directed openings 

(122) in the upper sheet (102), outwardly directed 
openings (124) in the lower sheet (106), and channels 

(126) extending through the mat (104), and further 
characterized by wicking elements (130) projecting 

through the outwardly directed openings (124) for 
drawing liquid into the core from the exterior of the 

product (100) through the outwardly directed openings

material of the mat (104) extending from the mat 

through the openings (124) in the lower sheet (106) 
and projecting outwardly beyond the outer surface of 

the lower sheet to form a plurality of wicks for
