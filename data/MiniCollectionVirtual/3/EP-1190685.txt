<ABSTRACT>
A stent in the form of a thin-walled, multi-cellular tubular structure is provided. The
tubular structure has a longitudinal axis and the stent includes a plurality of circumferential sets

of strut members. Each set of the strut members is longitudinally displaced from each other and
connected to each other by longitudinally extending links. Each set of the strut members forms

a closed and cylindrical portion of the stent. Further, each set of the strut members includes a
plurality of connected curve sections and diagonal sections. The sets of the strut members further

include end sets of strut members located at each end of the stent and central sets of strut
members located between the end sets of the strut members. The diagonal sections of the end

sets of the strut members have a center portion and two ends. At least one of the diagonal
sections of the end sets of the strut members includes a tapered shape with width of one diagonal

section is greater at the center of the diagonal section than the width at either end of the diagonal
section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of stents for implantation into a vessel of a human body,Stents are well known medical devices that are used for maintaining the patency of a large variety of vessels of the human body. A more frequent use is for implantation into the coronary vasculature. Although stents have been used for this purpose for more than ten years, and some current stent designs such as the CORDIS BX Velocity Velocity ® stent, Cordis Corporation, Miami Lakes, FL, have the required flexibility and radial rigidity to provide an excellent clinical result, they are not always clearly seen under standard fluoroscopy.Many current tubular stents use a multiplicity of circumferential sets of strut members connected by either straight longitudinal connecting links or undulating longitudinal connecting links. The circumferential sets of strut members are typically formed from a series of diagonal sections connected to curved sections forming a closed-ring, zig-zag structure. This structure opens up as the stent expands to form the element in the stent that provides structural support for the arterial wall. A single strut member can be thought of as a diagonal section connected to a curved section within one of the circumferential sets of strut members. In current stent designs such as the BX Velocity ® stent, these sets of strut members are formed from a single piece of metal having a uniform wall thickness and generally uniform strut width. Although a stent with uniform width of the strut members will function, if the width is increased to add strength or radiopacity, the sets of strut members will experience increased strain upon expansion. High strain can cause cracking of the metal and potential fatigue failure of the stent under the cyclic stress of a beating heart.Existing highly radiopaque stents, such as the gold plated NIROYAL stent sold by Boston Scientific, Inc., Natick MA, can obscure the inside of the vessel due to the high radiopacity over the entire length of the stent. The BeStent sold by Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis MN, has small gold markers at the ends of the stent. Those markers only mark an end point without allowing visualization of the entire end set of strut members.Fischell et al, in US Patent No. 6,086,604, discloses a stent with the end sets of strut members being gold plated. Such a stent would have ideal radiopacity but may be subject to the corrosive effects incurred through placement of dissimilar metals in an electrolytic solution such as blood. There has also been

<CLAIMS>
A stent (30) in the form of a thin-walled, multi-cellular, tubular structure having a longitudinal axis, the stent comprising a multiplicity of circumferential sets of strut members (32, 36), each set of strut members being longitudinally separated each from the other and each set of strut members forming a closed, cylindrical portion of the stent, each set of strut members comprising a multiplicity of connected curved sections (37, 33) and diagonal sections (39, 38), the sets of strut members including a respective end set of strut members (32) located at each end of the stent, each end set of strut members consisting of alternating curved sections (37) and diagonal sections (39) connected to form a closed circumferential structure, and central sets of strut members (36) positioned between the end sets of strut members, the diagonal sections (39) of each end set of strut members having a generally greater width than the diagonal sections (38) of each and every central set of strut members so as to improve the radiopacity of the end sets of strut members as compared to the radiopacity of the central sets of strut members; and

a plurality of flexible connecting links (34) linking curved sections of adjacent longitudinally separated sets of strut members.
The stent of claim 2, wherein the flexible connecting links are "M" links.
