<ABSTRACT>
Beads of molten glass fall successively into a scoop channel (8) which supplies one after another with beads a number of channel systems (3) e.g. of an I.S. glass making machine and which is pivotable about a vertical axis. The bead moves along a movement path (13) from the scoop channel (8) in free flight onto a sliding body (9), from this in free flight into a long channel (10) and from this again in free flight into an end channel (11) which is curved downwards. The end channel (11) delivers the bead in such a manner that its longitudinal axis runs coaxially with the longitudinal axis (31) of a mould (4) to be charged. The sliding body (9) is supported rigidly on the machine. The long channel (10) is supported with its upper end (18) on the sliding body (9) via a universal joint (38). The lower end (23) of the long channel (10) is guided in a vertical shaft (42) of the end channel (11) and can be raised and lowered by an adjusting device (43).
