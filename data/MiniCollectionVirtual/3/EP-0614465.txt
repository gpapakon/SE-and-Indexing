<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hybrid protein, its use in
medicine, particularly in the prevention of malaria infections and vaccines
containing it.Malaria, is one of the world's major health problems with 2 to 4 million
people dying from the disease each year. One of the most acute forms of
the disease is caused by the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum
which is responsible for most of the mortality attributable to Malaria.The life cycle of P. falciparum is complex, requiring two hosts, man and
mosquito for completion. The infection of man is initiated by the
inoculation of sporozoites in the saliva of an infected mosquito. The
sporozoites migrate to the liver and there infect hepatocytes where they
differentiate, via the exoerythrocytic intracellular stage, into the
merozoite stage which infects red blood cells (RBC) to initiate cyclical
replication in the asexual blood stage. The cycle is completed by the
differentiation of a number of merozoites in the RBC into sexual stage
gametocytes which are ingested by the mosquito, where they develop
through a series of stages in the midgut to produce sporozoites which
migrate to the salivary gland.The sporozoite stage of P. falciparum has been identified as a potential
target of a malaria vaccine. The major surface protein of the sporozoite is
known as circumsporozoite protein (CS Protein). This protein from strain
7G8 has been cloned, expressed and sequenced (Dame et al Science 225
(1984) p593). The protein from strain 7G8 is characterised by having a
central immunodominant repeat region comprising a tetrapeptide
Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro repeated 37 times but interspersed with four minor
repeats Asn-Val-Asp-Pro. In other strains the number of major and minor
repeats vary as well as their relative position. This central portion is
flanked by an N and C terminal portion composed of non-repetitive amino
acid sequences designated as the repeatless portion of the CS protein.It has been shown that irradiated sporozoites can provide significant
protection against experimental human malaria (Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.
24: 297-402, 1975). However, production difficulties makes the use of 
irradiated sporozoite impractical from the point of view of producing a
vaccine.Several groups have proposed subunit vaccines based on the
circumsporozoite protein. Two of these vaccines have undergone clinical
testing; one is a synthetic peptide, the other is a recombinant protein
(Ballou et al Lancet: i 1277 (1987) and Herrington et al Nature 328:257
(1987).These vaccines were
