<ABSTRACT>
A spreading disc (1) of a fertiliser spreading machine 
of centrifugal-type includes a supporting plate (2) and 

a plurality of spreading blades (3) each having a 
channel configuration, with a bottom wall (4) formed by 

two adjacent portions (4a, 4b) defining an angle 
therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fertiliser 
spreading machines of the known type comprising a 
supporting frame provided with means for attachment 
thereof to a tractor, at least a spreading disc which 
is rotatably mounted on the supporting frame around a 
vertical axis and provided with a plurality of 
spreading blades, a power transmission for rotating the 
spreading disc carried by the frame and having a 
connecting end for coupling to a tractor power outlet, 
and a fertiliser feeding hopper located over the 
spreading disc. The present invention is particularly related to a 
spreading disc of the known type comprising a 
supporting plate and a plurality of spreading blades 
fixed to the supporting plate and having a channel 
shape. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
centrifugal type fertiliser spreading machine which is 
able to provide the best possible spreading of the 
fertiliser both with regard to the size of the 
spreading area, and with regard to the shape thereof. In order to achieve this object, the invention 
provides a spreading disc of the above indicated type, 
characterised in that the bottom wall of each channel-shaped 
spreading blade has, at least throughout a 
portion of its longitudinal extension, two longitudinal 
portions arranged side by side and defining an angle 
therebetween. Due to this feature, the product which is canalised 
within the two adjacent portions of the bottom wall of 
each blade is projected outwardly along two different  
 
directions, so as to provide the best possible 
spreading of the fertiliser. In a preferred embodiment, said two portions of the 
bottom wall of each blade which are inclined to each 
other have a different length, the shorter portion 
being inclined in a direction opposite to that of 
rotation of the spreading disc. Due to this feature, 
the product which is guided within the shorter portion 
is projected by centrifugal effect at a different 
speed, and not only along a different direction, with 
respect to the product which is guided within the 
longer channel-shaped portion. Tests conducted by the applicant have shown that 
the spreading disc according to the invention 
dramatically improves the spreading characteristics of 
the machine. The invention also provides a fertiliser spreading 
machine including a spreading disc of the above 
indicated type. Further features and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the description which follows 
with reference to the annexed drawings, given purely by 
way

<CLAIMS>
Spreading disc (1) for fertiliser spreading 
machines of centrifugal-type, comprising a supporting 

plate (2) and a plurality of spreading blades (3) fixed 
to the supporting plate (2) and each having a channel 

configuration, characterised in that the bottom wall 
(4) of each spreading blade (3) has, at least 

throughout a portion of its longitudinal extension, two 
longitudinal portions arranged side by side (4a, 4b), 

defining an angle (B) therebetween. 
Spreading disc according to claim 1, characterised 
in that said portions of the bottom wall (4) of each 

spreading blade (3) which are inclined to each other 
(4a, 4b) have different lengths, the shorter portion 

being inclined in a direction opposite to the direction 
of rotation. 
Spreading disc according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the splitting of the bottom wall (4) into said 

two inclined portions (4a, 4b) starts from a point of 
the blade (3) which is spaced from the radially inner 

end of the blade. 
Spreading disc according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the bottom wall (4) has a plurality of 

longitudinal ridges having a depth increasing radially 
outwardly. 
Spreading disc according to claim 1, characterised 
in that said angle (B) is between 1° and 4°. 
Fertiliser spreading machine of centrifugal type, 
characterised in that it includes at least one 

spreading disc according to any of the preceding 
claims.
