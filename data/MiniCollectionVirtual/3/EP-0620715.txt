<ABSTRACT>
Wire drawer with a ribbonshaped upper rim (11). To this rim, a guiding roller (14) is attached at each of two adjacent corners. To carry this roller, the rim is bent down at the corner to make a lug (12) perpendicular to the plane of the rim. The axel (15) of the roller is attached in a central area of this lug to hold the roller within the outer edge (17) of the rim extending above its upper level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to wire drawers as described in the introductory part of claim 1 
and more particularly wiredrawers for wardrobe cabinets. Wire baskets carried in slides attaced in cabinets, in carrying frames and similar 
structures are used as drawers. It is previously known to attach a pair of slides, each with a guide roller, at 
opposite edges of a frame made of steel ribbon. This design requires a relatively 
high mass of additional material resulting in an increase in height which in some 
cases is unsuitable and undesirable. This design requires additional equipment and additional manufacturing steps. 
Thus it is desirable to have a wire basket which is more economic to produce. The main object of the invention is to create a wire drawer which is less expensive 
to manufacture than prior art drawers. It is a particular object to create a wire 
drawer with less parts and which can be manufactured with less manufacturing steps 
than prior art wire drawers with guide rollers. The invention is described in claim 1, while particularly advantageous features are 
described in the subclaims. This wire drawer keeps the material consumption to a 
minimum, while the manufacturing operations to mount the guide rollers are simple 
and can be robotized. The invention is further described with reference to the drawings illustrating an 
embodiment, wherein 
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a corner of a wire drawer, while Fig. 2 shows the corner of Fig. 1 in top plan view. The wire drawer in the example is provided with a rectangular frame 11 of 
steel ribbon arranged in the frame plane, the ends being joined by welding. At two 
adjacent comers the frame is bent downwardly resulting in two mutually parallel lugs 
12 which extend down from the plane of the frame with the inner sides thereof 
adjacent the inner edge of the frame. This creates a notch at the edge of the frame as 
shown at 13 in Fig. 2. In this notch, a guide roller 14 rotably journalled on an axle 
15 is arranged. The axle locates in a bore in the lug 12 and is riveted thereto. The 
axle 15 is arranged centrally on the lug which results in the guide roller extending 
above the frame 11 and below the lug 12. The axle 15 may be pressed or cut with 
flanges 15A and provided with a washer 15B at the free end thereof. The lugs 12 are 
bent downwardly with one edge 18 arranged to be further distant from the corner 
than the other 19. This allows attachment of the guide roller 14 to take place with no additional 
elements and with easy assembly

<CLAIMS>
Basket intended for use as drawer in a cabinet or similar structure, 
with an upper rectangular rim or flange of ribbon material on a meshed wire or 

sheet structure, this rim being in a common plane, and on two adjacent comers 
being provided with guide rollers (14) intended to cooperate with an individual guide 

rail carried by the cabinet or the similar structure,
characterized in
that the ribbon rim or flange at each of the adjacent comers is bent down to create 
a lug (12) perpendicular to the plane of the rim or flange, 
that the axle (15) of the guide roller is attached centrally on this lug, and 
that the guide roller is arranged to protrude over the rim or flange. 
Basket according to claim 1,
characterized in
 
that each lug (12) is bent downwardly with a first bending edge (18) at a greater 

distance from the corner than a second bending edge (19). 
Basket according to claim 1,
characterized in
 
that the lug (12) is bent downwardly to be adjacent the inner side of the rim or 

flange. 
Basket according to claim 1,
characterized in
 
that the axis of the axle (15) is arranged at a lower level than the lower side of the 

rim or flange.
