<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED METHOD FOR PREPARING SOLUBLE GLUCANS1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved, highly efficient method for preparing soluble glucans. The method advantageously avoids the use of a highly polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) . The soluble glucans prepared by the method of the invention are non-toxic and exert pronounced immunobiological responses when administered in vivo, most notably immunostimulation of macrophage activities and stimulation of hematopoietic bone marrow activity. The soluble glucans also exhibit significant effects against malignant neoplasms, including melanomas and sarcomas.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The term "glucan" refers generically to a variety of naturally occurring homopolysaccharides or polyglucoses, including polymers such as cellulose, amylose, glycogen, laminarians, starch, etc. Glucan encompasses branched and unbranched chains of glucose units linked by 1-3, 1-4, and 1-6 glucosidic bonds that may be of either the alpha or beta type. As defined herein, "particulate glucan" designates a water-insoluble particulate (about 1-3 μ) polyglucose such as that derived from the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomvces cerevisiae. Particulate glucan is macromolecular and comprises a closed chain of glucopyranose units united by a series of β-1-3 glucosidic linkages. (Hassid et al., 1941, J. A er. Chem. Soc. 63.:295-298; DiLuzio et al., 1979, Int'l J. Cancer 2A_*.773-779) . X-ray diffraction studies have demonstrated that particulate glucans exist in the 

form of a triple-stranded helix. (Sarko et al., 1983, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 11:139-142) .Particulate glucan is a potent activator of the macrophage/monocyte cell series, complement, as well as T and B cell lymphocytes. Thus, particulate glucan has profound effects on both the reticuloendothelial and immune systems. Particulate glucan has been shown to modify host resistance to a wide variety of infectious diseases (see review by DiLuzio, 1983, Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 4.:344-347 and references cited therein) . In addition particulate glucan has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival in syngeneic murine tumor models (DiLuzio et al., 1979, Advances in Exp. Med. Biol. 12_1A:269-290) . In vitro studies using normal and tumor cells incubated with particulate glucan have demonstrated that glucan exerts a cytostatic effect on sarcoma and melanoma cells and a proliferative effect on normal spleen and bone marrow cells (Williams et al., 1985, Hepatology 5 :198-206) .Notwithstanding
