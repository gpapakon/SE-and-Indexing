<ABSTRACT>
A control system provides active attenuation of excitations to a region or structure (1). A feedback sensor (14) generates a signal in response to excitations of the region (1) which is fed to a narrow-band feedback controller (5) having a frequency detector (4), a bandpass filter (6) controlled by the frequency detector (4), and a feedback control generator (8). The frequency detector (4) determines the peak frequency of the excitations. A bandpass filter (6) passes only those signals from the feedback sensor (14) in a narrow frequency band adjustably controlled by the frequency detector (4). The feedback control generator (8) receives the filtered signal from the bandpass filter (6) and produces a control output used by an actuator (13) to attenuate the excitations. Several bandpass filters (6) can be used in parallel to attenuate several frequency bands if the excitation source has a plurality of peaks. This configuration allows the bands to move across the frequency spectrum in response to the excitations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ACTIVE FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM FORTRANSIENT NARROW-BAND DISTURBANCEREJECTION OVER A HIDE SPECTRAL RANGERELATED APPLICATIONThe present application is based on the Applicants' US Provisional Patent Application 60/019,166, entitled Feedback Control System For Narrow-Band And Medium-Band Active Noise And Vibration Attenuation, filed on June 5, 1996. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention. This invention is related to systems for attenuating noise and vibration, including the nulling of primary excitations and the attenuation of narrow-band and frequency limited broad-band noise and vibrations using control signals that are applied through actuators. tatement of the Problem. Various systems have been proposed for actively reducing vibrations and noise. In general, these prior art systems can be divided into four groups. From a control view point, these can be either feedforward or feedback, and based on excitation source characteristics they are either for repetitive or random excitations. Almost all prior art systems utilize some form of computer or digital signal processing (DSP) board to implement their techniques.Therefore, regardless of the control technique or excitation source, the prior art systems are subject to cost/performance limitations due to the required processing power and sampling period. US Patents Nos. 5,245,552 and 5,233,540 concentrate on digital estimation of a feed-forward active control for single or multiple repetitive vibrations. These systems use filters, phase differentiator, and digital signal processors that are used to identify an individual peak. Its frequency and phase lag are compared to a reference signal to develop a feed-forward control action for those identified frequencies.US Patent No. 5,133,017, describes a seat with noise suppression near the occupant's ears using a direct 

feedforward signal and a controller that tries to estimate frequency and phase delay between the source and the detecting sensor at individual frequencies.US Patent Nos. 5,365,594 and 5,361,303, discuss an ideal adaptive control system for noise reduction based on a feedforward signal that measures excitation then uses synchronous sampling and discrete Fourier transform to adaptively estimate amplitude and phase of the outgoing control signal that would cancel the incoming noise. The proposed system did not perform in real time with the proposed processing hardware.US Patent Nos. 5,337,366, 5,278,780, and 5,408,532 describe an active control apparatus using adaptive digital filters
