<ABSTRACT>
A conductor for use in a flat cable includes thereon a 
tin or tin alloy plating the thickness of which is 

substantially uniform over the whole periphery of a flat 
conductor, in order to provide a conductor for use in a flat 

cable which can minimize variations in the plating thickness 
thereof, provide a good contact reliability with respect to a 

connector when it is used in a flat cable, and causes no 
increase in the contact resistance thereof in a humidity 

withstand test after it is inserted into and removed from the 
connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufactoring conductor for use in 
a thin flat cable according to the preamble of claim 1 used as an internal wiring in various kinds 
of electronic application products such as an electronic desktop 
computer, a printer, a copying machine and the like, and a 
method and equipment for practising this method of manufacturing the conductor. A method according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol 17, no. 133 of 19.03.93 and JP-A-43 013 440. A tin plated copper conductor of square shape is known from EP-A-626 702 (54(3)document). WO-A-8 801 431 reaches a flat multicable assembly, preferably. Conventionally, to manufacture a thin flat cable, for 
example, as shown in Fig. 1, a plurality of flat conductors 11 
are arranged at a predetermined distance from one another and 
in parallel to one another, and two polyester films 21 each 
having polyester system adhesives attached thereto are 
laminated onto the respective flat conductors from above and 
below with the adhesive attached surfaces of the two films 
facing each other, thereby forming an insulation layer 2. This type of laminated flat cable provides a small 
space factor and thus is advantageous in reducing the size of 
the electronic application products and, therefore, it is used 
in various electronic application products. Especially, as 
shown in Fig. 2, a method of use of such a laminated flat 
cable, in which the conductor 1 on one surface of the end 
portion of the flat conductor 11 is exposed and the flat  
 
conductor 11 is then used in combination with a removable 
connector (which allows insertion and removal), has been used 
more and more frequently, because this method is advantageous 
in handling, that is, this method allows easy change and 
replacement of parts, wirings and the like. As the method using a combination of the removable 
connector with the laminated flat cable of this type has been 
spread, there has arisen a requirement for stable contact 
reliability with respect to the removable connector which needs 
to be frequently inserted into and removed from the laminated 
flat cable of this type for a long period of use. In addition, 
as the results of various tests for enhancement of the contact 
reliability with respect to the removable connector, found is 
that the contact reliability for a long period of use is 
closely related with a tin plating or a tin alloy plating such 
as a tin/lead alloy plating treated on the conductor. In other words, as
