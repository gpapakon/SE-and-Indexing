<ABSTRACT>
A fume-exhausting apparatus in particular for chimneys 
and fireplaces comprises a plurality of fume-conveying 

channels (5, 105) extending whithin a hood (3, 103) in a 
chimney or fireplace and exhibiting lower openings (5a) 

directed downwardly and disposed close to the lower 
inlet mouth (3a) of the hood (3, 103) and upper openings 

(5b) directed upwardly, close to the lower end of the 
flue (4). In an alternative version, the apparatus 

comprises at least one main section (102) for recovering 
heat from the fumes, consisting of a heat-exchange 

chamber (106) adapted to hold a circulating fluid to be 
heated, and a plurality of main pipe coils (105) 

extending within the heat-exchange chamber (106) and 
adapted to receive and convey the fumes coming from the 

hood (103).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fume-exhausting 
apparatus, in particular for chimneys and fireplaces, 
having the features recited in the preamble of claim 1. It is known that chimneys, fireplaces and similar 
structures do not always have a satisfactory and 
appropriate draught, that is a capacity of 
appropriately conveying and drawing fumes into a flue. 
In fact, sometimes fume vortices and refluxes towards 
the room where a fireplace is located may be created, 
due either to the presence of excess smoke in the 
hearth, for example when some foods are being barbecued, 
or to an imperfect design and construction of the 
fireplaces themselves. Under the foregoing and other similar situations, for 
example when particular weather conditions are present 
or, above all, at the initial ignition step, when the 
operating temperatures of the flue do not correspond to 
those provided for a steady state operation, fumes do 
not succeed in overcoming the upper hood restriction at 
the point where said hood is connected to the flue and 
therefore tend to invade the inner environment or room 
in which the chimney or fireplace is located. The document FR-A-2 467 358, which is herein referred as 
the most relevant state of the art, teaches to provide, 
in a chimney comprising a hearth and a hood for 
collecting fumes to be sent to a flue, a number of 
channels having lower openings directed downwardly close 
to the lower inlet mouth of the hood and upper openings 
directed upwardly and communicating with the lower end 
of the flue. An air stream is drived around the 
conveying channel and blown into the room, in such a 
manner to provide a heat recovering from the fumes. US Patent n. 4,100,913 teaches to provide conveying 
channels extending from the upper portion of the hood 
and entering the lower end of the flue. Also in this 
document the conveying channels are arranged for 
providing a heat recovering by an air stream passing 
around the channels itselves. Also US Patent n. 2,277,381 teaches to provide conveying 
channels extending from the upper portion of the hood 
and arranged for providing a heat recovering from the 
fumes, by an air stream blown around the channels 
itselves. Under this situation the technical task underlying the 
present invention is to provide a fume-exhausting 
apparatus, in particular for chimneys and fireplaces, 
capable of substantially eliminating the above 
drawbacks. Within the scope of this technical task it is an 
important object of the present invention to devise a 
fume-e

<CLAIMS>
A fume-exhausting apparatus, in particular for 
chimneys and fireplaces, said apparatus 

comprising a hearth (2) and a hood (3) for 
collecting said fumes to be sent to a flue (4), 

said apparatus comprising a plurality of 
channels (5) for conveying said fumes, which 

conveying channels (5) have lower openings (5a) 
directed downwardly close to the lower inlet mouth of 

said hood (3), and upper openings (5b) directed 
upwardly and communicating with the lower end of the 

flue,
 
characterized in that said conveying channels (5) are 

each comprised of at least one lower movable portion 
("A") and one upper fixed portion ("B") telescopically 

sliding into each other, and in that support and 
movement means for said movable lower portions are 

provided for positioning them at a desired height above 
said hearth (2). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said conveying channels (5) are defined by lengths 

of rectilinear pipes disposed in mutual side by side 
relation and converging close to an upper portion of 

said hood (3). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said conveying channels (5) comprise a main 

conveying channel (5c) disposed centrally substantially 
above the flame in said hearth (2) and a plurality of 

auxiliary conveying channels (5d) disposed 
perimetrically and each of them having a transverse 

section the area of which is lower than that of a 
transverse section of the main conveying channel (5c). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said conveying channels (5) all together exhibit a 

transverse section the area of which corresponds at 
least to the area of the transverse section of said flue 

(4).
