A process for preparing 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene of the 
formula I 


 
which comprises reacting 1-aminovinyl methyl ketones of 

the general formula II 

 
where R

-alkylene chain which is 
unsubstituted or substituted once to 4 times by C

-alkyl 
and may be interrupted by oxygen, nitrogen or 

sulfur,
 
in the presence of acids at from 0 to 150°C under from 

0.01 to 50 bar, and obtaining the 1-aminovinyl methyl 
ketones II from diacetylene and secondary amines by 


a) removing by absorption a part-stream which contains 
diacetylene of the formula III 


H-C≡C-C≡C-H
 
from the cracked gas resulting from acetylene production,  

 
and 
b) reacting this part-stream with secondary amines of 
the general formula IV 


 
where R
1
 and R
2
 have the abovementioned meanings, 
and water in the presence or absence of a diluent at 

from 0 to 150°C under from 0.01 to 5 bar.
