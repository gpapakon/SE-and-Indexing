<ABSTRACT>
A read/write magnetic head assembly includes an inductive write 
head (42,44) and a 

magnetoresistive (MR) read head (14,26). The inductive write head 
(42,44) includes 

first and second magnetic poles, P1 (42) and P2 (48) respectively, 

which form a magnetic circuit 
with a write transducing gap. The P1 pole (42) is formed in an integral 

structure with a 
wider extending flux shield section (44). The shield section (44) 

extends from the lower 
surface of the P1 layer to define a stepped or staggered configuration. 

The MR 
head (14,26) includes an MR sensor element (26) that is disposed 

between a lower flux 
shielding layer (22) and the P1 pole/shield section structure (42,44). 

The narrow width 
of the P1 pole layer at the write gap region and the extended shield 

section (44) of the 
integral P1 pole/shield structure (42,44) serve to reduce the write 

fringing field which 
occurs during this write mode. In this way, the recorded data tracks 

can be narrowed with a resultant increase in track density.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin film magnetic head assembly and
in particular to a read/write head or transducer incorporating a
magnetoresistive sensing read element.Presently known magnetic head assemblies are fabricated with an
inductive write head and a magnetoresistive (MR) read element.
Typical inductive write heads incorporate thin film Permalloy
layers, designated as P1 and P2 respectively, that form a
magnetic circuit with a transducing gap, as is well known.
During the write mode, magnetic flux representative of a data
signal emanates from the write gap and a signal is registered on
a rotating disk that is close to the write gap. It is known that
there is undesirable fringing flux associated with the write
magnetic field. Such fringing flux from the write field has a
deleterious effect in that there is a limit on the width of the
data tracks that can be written and accordingly a limit on the
track density or tracks per inch. It is desirable to contain
such fringing flux so that data track density can be increased.One prior art approach that addresses the problem of fringing
flux is to use a shield/pole element, such as described in U.S.
patent 4,803,580. The shielding is effective both against the
inductive field from the P1 and P2 poles and against the fringing
field of the adjacent tracks on the surface of the storage disk.
In the patented device, the shield/pole element, which includes
the first deposited P1 layer and a Permalloy shield, is formed as
a very wide structure wherein the P1 pole layer and the shield
are of the same thickness.In disk drives using rotary actuators, skew of the magnetic head
as the head is moved from inner radius tracks to outer radius 
tracks is a factor to be considered. As the spacing between the
write gap and the read gap is reduced, the adverse effect of skew
is also reduced.JP-A-5 143 939 discloses a magnetic head assembly
according to the preamble of independent claim 6.An object of this invention is to provide an improved thin film
magnetic head assembly which effectively reduces fringing flux during
the write mode and which allows the recording of data with higher
track density.Another object of this invention is to provide a thin film
magnetic head assembly having an inductive write gap and an MR
read gap that are closely spaced to compensate for head skew.Another object is to provide a thin film magnetic head assembly
including an MR sensor element that is shielded from the magnetic
field including fringing flux generated during the write mode.In
