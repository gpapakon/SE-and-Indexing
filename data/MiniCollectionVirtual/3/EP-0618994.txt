<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wireline apparatus for sidewall coring in oil and
gas bore holes. More particularly, this invention relates to sidewall rotary coring
apparatus for obtaining large sidewall cores in bore holes.It is common geophysical practice to collect cores from oil and gas bore
holes at known depths for analyzing the core materials in order to determine
various characteristics of the subterranean earth formation. In oil and gas well bore
holes, it is conventional to be able to obtain sidewall cores that are usually a
maximum of 1.6 inches (40 mm) in length and 0.9 inches (23 mm) in diameter.
The cores are recovered and analyzed at the surface to determine the physical
properties of the formation adjacent to the bore hole.The current sidewall coring tools are complex and do not allow the coring
of large sidewall cores, cores larger than the 1.6 in x 0.9 in (40 x 23 mm) size
mentioned above. The current tools use small high speed motors to drive the rotary
coring apparatus which is not suitable in coring very hard rock formations, and
have a tendency to become stuck in the formation. Most rotary sidewall coring
tools have the drive motor axially aligned with the coring bit and tube which
substantially limits the size of the motor and the length of the core that is
obtainable in small diameter bore holes of 6 to 8 inches (152 to 204 mm) in
diameter. Most coring tools do not have a reliable decentralizing arm system that
is capable of exerting sufficient locking forces between the wall of the bore hole
and the tool surface that will hold the tool in place during the coring operation,
especially when the tool is coring in hard rock formations.For example, US 2,546,670 discloses a system according to the preamble of claim 1 which enables a coring bit
to be shut down when it has reached the desired limit of travel.Accordingly, the present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior
art by providing apparatus for rigidly anchoring the coring tool in place and an
improved rotary coring apparatus for permitting the coring of large sidewall cores.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
sidewall coring tool comprising:
an elongated body secured by a wireline cable supporting a rotary coring bit 
apparatus including a rotary coring bit, the tool being adapted for suspension within
a borehole by the wireline cable at a selected depth, anda decentralizing arm apparatus mounted on said tool body on the side
opposite the side of the body from which the rotary coring bit

side opposite the side of the body from which the rotary coring bit (44) is

advanced, said decentralizing arm apparatus spaced above and below the location
of the rotary coring apparatus (58), for deploying decentralizing arms from said tool

body into contact with the borehole wall and forcing the side of the tool body, from
which the rotary coring bit will be advanced, into contact with the borehole wall

and maintaining the tool body rigidly against the borehole wall during the coring
operation,

a linkage (126, 130, 138) mounted within said elongated tool body and
cooperating with said rotary coring apparatus (58) for advancing and retracting the

rotary coring bit (44) transversely therefrom, said rotary coring bit being coupled
to a driving means (122) having sufficient torque for drilling and recovering a large

core sample from the sidewall (29) of the borehole,

   and being characterised in that the rotary coring apparatus further includes:

a sequence valve (222) in association with a pilot valve (224) for
automatically providing bit pressure compensation during advance of the coring bit;
a pressurized fluid delivery system (156) for flushing out the cuttings and
debris during the rotary coring operation;
an electrical control circuit (32, 34) disposed on the earth's surface for
permitting selected control of preselected functions of said coring apparatus; and
surface monitoring apparatus (320, 139) associated with the control circuit
(34) and circuitry disposed in the tool body and cooperating with said rotary coring

bit apparatus (58) for permitting continuous surface visual indication of the travel
of the coring bit with respect to the tool body during the coring operation.

apparatus is capable of obtaining large sidewall core samples.
The coring tool as described in claim 1, wherein said decentralizing
arm apparatus is automatically unlocked if there is a hydraulic system failure.
The coring tool as described in claim 1, wherein said rotary coring
apparatus permits the reversal of direction of the rotation of the coring bit for

permitting unscrewing of the bit if it becomes stuck in the formation.
