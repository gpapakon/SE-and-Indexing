for use with the crate in which the crate is formed, for 

each carton with a set of upstanding spacer posts 
(P₁,P₂;P₃,P₄) arranged in two pairs. 

The carton is impaled upon 
the set of posts when it is received in the crate. The 

posts (P₁,P₂) of one pair of posts are each sized to span 
the space between a pair of bottles (B₁,B₃;B₂,B₄) 

adjacent a 
central bottle (B

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shipping crate and to the combination of such a shipping crate 
and a carton adapted to receive a plurality of articles, such as bottles, and adapted for use 
with the crate. The crate is particularly adapted to receive a multiplicity of returnable glass 
bottles either singly or in groups packaged in such cartons. The invention is also concerned with a complementary carton which accommodates a 
plurality of bottles in a group and which is adapted to be received in the crate with the 
bottles arranged as they would otherwise be without the presence of the carton. Such crates and cartons are known as such from AT-B-368 967.  
 The drinks industry uses a standard sized crate to contain twenty individual articles, for 
example, bottles in a 4 x 5 arrangement. There is a growing demand for these 20 
bottle crates to be used in conjunction with multiple packaging. The partition used in 
existing crates make it impossible to use multipacks with the crates. The problems in 
producing such a crate and carton is that (i) the crate must remain a standard size, (ii) 
the number of articles per crate must remain the same, and (iii) the cartons must be the 
same design and therefore, contain the same number of articles. The solution is to re-configure the position of the articles into groups of five with a 
central article surrounded by four other articles. The crate is with a pair of spacers to 
maintain the distances between adjacent outer articles. A problem caused by adopting this configuration is that the lower portion of the 
central article is not stable because it is not supported by the side walls. The crate, 
according to the invention, overcomes this particular problem by the introduction of a 
pair of posts which pass through corresponding tabs, and also maintain the distance 
between adjacent outer articles In addition, the introduction of the posts through the 
tabs enables the tabs to be locked. The shape of the posts (and tabs) and the spacers not only maintain the distance 
between the central article and outer articles, but also assist in stabilising the central 
article thereby maintaining the relative position of each article. AT-B-368 967 is directed to a crate for 
containing 24 articles. Accordingly, neither the problems outlined above nor the 
particular solutions achieved by this invention are present.  
 One aspect of the present invention provides a crate for accommodating returnable bottles 
including a plurality of sets of internal spacer means arranged to

<CLAIMS>
A crate (Ct) for accommodating returnable bottles including a plurality of sets of 
internal spacer means (P
1
, P
2
, P
3
, P
4
) arranged to allow articles to be received in discrete 
groups characterised in that said spacer means of each set are arranged such that the spaces 

available to receive bottles (B
1
, B
2
, B
3
, B
4
, Bc) include a central space which, together with 
corresponding spaces in other sets, produce rows whose spaces are out registry with the 

spaces available to receive bottles in each adjacent row of spaces. 
A crate (Ct) for returnable bottles and carton combination in which the crate is 
formed, for each carton, with a set of upstanding spacer posts comprising two pairs of 

posts (P
1
, P
2
, P
3
, P
4
) upon which the carton is to be impaled, characterised in that each post 
of one pair of posts (P
1
, P
2
) is sized to span the space between a pair of spaced bottles (B
1
, 
B
3
, B
2
, B
4
) and, together with the posts (P
3
, P
4
) of the other pair of posts, create between 
them a central space for a single bottle (Bc) of the group. 
A crate and carton combination according to claim 2 wherein each post of the other 
pair (P
3
, P
4
) is adapted to cooperate with locking means (T
1
, T
2
, N
1
, N
2
) which secures base 
panels (12, 24) of the carton together, such that said posts of the other pair (P
3
, P
4
) can be 
engaged with and disengaged from the locking means (T
1
, T
2
, N
1
, N
2
) without causing the 
locking means to be dislodged. 
A crate and carton combination as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 wherein each set of 
spacer posts comprising said two pairs (P
1
, P
2
, P
3
, P
4
) is separated from an adjacent set by 
internal partition means (PP
1
). 
A crate and carton combination as claimed in claim 4 wherein said internal partition 
means (PP
1
) separates the crate substantially along its longitudinal and transverse centre 
lines to separate four similar said sets of spacer means (AC
1
, AC
2
, AC
3
, AC
4
). 
A crate and carton combination as claimed in any of claims 2 to 5 wherein said 
single bottle is a central bottle (Bc) in a group of five bottles (B
1
, B
2
, B
3
, B
4
, Bc).  
 
A carton of the wrap around type for use in a crate or combination according to 
any of the preceding claims said carton accommodating a group of five bottles (B

apertures (X, Y) is provided at diametrically opposed locations relative to said single 

central bottle (Bc), each aperture (X, Y) being sized and positioned to receive one of a first 
pair of spacer posts (P
1
, P
2
) of said crate and wherein locking means (T
1
, T
2
, N
1
, N
2
