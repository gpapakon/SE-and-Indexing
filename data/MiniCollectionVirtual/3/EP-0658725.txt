Method for regulating the flow in a district heating distribution
station, in which by means of a defined cross-sectional reduction provided

in a bypass line to the main valve, as a function of the regulated volume
flow of the bypass line, a pressure difference is produced, in which in the

case of low flows the main valve is kept closed and only on exceeding a
predetermined pressure difference as a result of the latter the flow is

regulated by the main valve in the main line.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that in the bypass line
the flow is regulated without auxiliary energy.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the flow in the
bypass is regulated by means of auxiliary energy.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the flow in the bypass line is regulated by a thermostat.
Device for regulating the flow in a district heating distribution
station with a regulating member (2) in a main line (1), in which in a

bypass line (3) to the main regulating member (2) are provided a cross-section
reducer (3a) in the form of a venturi nozzle, a venturi tube or a

twist tube and a specific regulator (11) and the main regulating member
(2) is subject to the action of the differential pressure by means of the

cross-section reducer (3a).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the main regulating
member (2) has a diaphragm drive (4).
Device according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the main
regulating member is provided with a closing spring (6) closing its valve

(2a).
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized in that the
regulator (11) in the bypass line (3) is an auxiliary energy-free regulator.
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized in that an 
auxiliary energy-controlled regulator (12, 13, 14) is provided in the

bypass line (3).
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 9, characterized in that a
pressure reducer is positioned in the bypass line downstream of the cross-section

reducer (3).
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 9, characterized in that an
overflow regulator is positioned in the bypass line upstream of the cross-section

reducer (3).
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 11, characterized in that
a valve (13) controlled by a temperature sensor (12) is located in the

bypass line.
Device according to one of the claims 5 to 10, characterized in that
an engine valve (14) is located in the bypass line.
