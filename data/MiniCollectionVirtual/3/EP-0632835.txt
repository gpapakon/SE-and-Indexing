<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transgenic plants
displaying multiple virus resistance which contain a
genetically engineered DNA sequence encoding at least
one polypeptide having a 2,5A synthetase activity.
Moreover, this invention relates to a process for the
production of said transgenic plants and to the use
of said genetically engineered DNA sequence.Several methods for the construction of virus-resistant
plants are described in the state of the
art. Genetically engineered resistance to a number of
plant viruses has been reported by expressing coat
protein of a respective plant virus in transgenic
plants (Beachy et al., Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 28
(1990), 451-474).
A substantial virus-resistance to several plant
viruses has also been demonstrated by expression of
specific viral antisense RNA in transgenic plants
(Cuozzo et al, Bio/Technology 6 (1988), 549-557;
Hemenway et al., EMBO J. 7 (1988), 1273-1280). The
viral antisense RNA exhibits its function either by
hybridizing to specific viral DNA or RNA sequences
and thus blocking further reactions which are
important for the virus propagation, or by ribozyme
activity which results in a specific cleavage of
viral RNA upon hydridisation to said viral RNA.
The main drawback of the above mentioned methods for
the construction of virus-resistant transgenic plants
is that said transgenic plants are resistant to only
one virus or a specific group of viruses.The 2,5A oligoadenylate pathway is part of the
antiviral response system induced by interferons in 
mammalian cells (Lengyel, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 51
(1982), 251-282). At least some components of the
2,5A pathway have been detected in organisms other
than mammals such as birds, reptilia and amphibia,
insects, yeasts and even bacteria (Stark et al.,
Nature 278 (1979), 471-473; Cayley et al., Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm. 108 (1982), 1243-1250; Laurence
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81 (1984),
2322-2326).
In plants, an antiviral factor (AVF), the production
of which is stimulated by virus infection, was
partially purified and its gene appeared to be
homologous to human Î²-interferon; Sela et al., in:
Plant resistance to Viruses: Ciba Symposium, No. 133
(1987), 109-119. Treatment of tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV)-infected tobacco protoplasts with human
interferon led to the inhibition of TMV-replication;
Sela, Methods in Enzymology, 119 (1986), 744-752.
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 2,5A can
inhibit TMV replication in tobacco plants; Devash et
al., J. Biol. Chem. 259 (1984), 3482-3486. DNA
