<ABSTRACT>
In a color cathode ray tube apparatus including an 
electron gun assembly (26) having a main electron lens 

section for focusing and converging three electron beams 
arranged in a line on a phosphor screen (22), three 

electron beam through holes arranged in a line in the 
arrangement direction of the three electron beams are 

formed in each of the opposing surfaces of the first 
electrode (G3) having a relatively low potential and a 

second electrode (G4) having a relatively high 
potential, which electrodes constitute the main electron 

lens second and substantially oppose, the pair of side 
beam through holes of the second electrode are 

decentered outward in the arrangement direction of the 
three electron beams with respect to the pair of side 

beam through holes of the first electrode, and each of 
the pair of side beam through holes of any one of the 

first and second electrodes is formed to have a substantially 
horizontally elongated shape in which both sides 

in the arrangement direction of the three electron beams 
are constituted by arcs and the length of the inner and 

outer arcs in the arrangement direction of the three 
electron beams is different from that of the outer arc. 

The three electron beams can be properly focused to 
obtain good image characteristics on an entire screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode 
ray tube apparatus and, more particularly, to a color 
cathode ray tube apparatus in which the focus characteristics 
of an electron gun assembly for emitting three 
electron beams arranged in a line and passing through 
the same plane are improved. A color cathode ray tube apparatus generally has 
the following structure. That is, three electron beams 
emitted from an electron gun assembly arranged in the 
neck of an envelope are deflected by horizontal and 
vertical deflecting magnetic fields generated by a 
deflection device arranged outside the envelope, and 
a color image is displayed by horizontally and vertically 
scanning a phosphor screen. As such a color 
cathode ray tube apparatus, an in-line type color 
cathode ray tube apparatus using an electron gun 
assembly for emitting three electron beams arranged in a 
line and consisting of a center beam and a pair of side 
beams which pass through the same horizontal plane is 
used. In general, the electron gun assembly of the color 
cathode ray tube apparatus has an electron beam forming 
section, which controls electron emission from cathodes, 
focuses the emitted electrons to form three electron 
beams and is constituted by the cathodes and a plurality 
of electrodes sequentially arranged adjacent to each  
 
other on the cathodes, and a main electron lens section 
constituted by a plurality of electrodes for focusing 
and converging the three electron beams obtained by 
the electron beam forming section on a phosphor 
screen. In the above color cathode ray tube apparatus, in 
order to make the characteristics of an image drawn on 
the phosphor screen preferable, the three electron beams 
emitted from the electron gun assembly must be appropriately 
focused and converged in the entire area of the 
phosphor screen. As a method of converging the three electron beams, 
for example, as described in U.S.P. No. 2,957,106, a 
method of inclining and emitting the three electron 
beams from the electron gun assembly is used. In 
addition, as described in U.S.P. No. 3,772,554, a method 
of converging the three electron beams such that, of the 
three electron beam through holes of the electrodes 
constituting the main electron lens section, a pair of 
side beam through holes are slightly externally 
decentered from the side beam through holes of the 
adjacent electrode on the electron beam forming section 
side is also used. Both the methods are popularly 
used. However, even when the electron gun assembly
