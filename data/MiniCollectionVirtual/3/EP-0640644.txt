<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorine-modified
silicone derivative, a preparation process thereof, and
cosmetic compositions containing such a silicone derivative,
and more particularly to a novel fluorine-modified silicone
derivative having excellent water and oil repellency, a
preparation process thereof, and cosmetic compositions
containing such a silicone derivative and having good
lastingness of makeup and feeling upon use.Various water-repellent cosmetic compositions have
heretofore been used with a view toward protecting the skin
from water and sweat and preventing makeup from getting out
of shape by water or sweat. For example, skin care cosmetic
compositions such as skin creams and skin lotions, and
makeup cosmetic compositions comprise a silicone oil or
silicone resin as a water-repellent component. However,
these silicone oil and resin can exhibit some effect on
water repellency, but has no satisfactory effect on oil
repellency. Therefore, cosmetic compositions in which these
components are incorporated have a problem that they can not
last makeup longer due to the excretion of sebum. Therefore, attempts to develop a compound having both
water repellency and oil repellency have been made in
various fields. For example, Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 295912/1990 discloses that a cosmetic
composition in which a specific fluorine-modified silicone
compound is incorporated is excellent in water resistance
and sebum resistance. EP-A-0 467 852 discloses
perfluoroalkylpolyoxyalkylpolysiloxane surfactants which
are useful for instance in rendering cellulosic and
natural and synthetic polyamide materials hydrophobic and
oleophobic.
Further DE-1 495 859 relates to cyclic
organopolysiloxanes having a CF3 substituted ether
residue and showing oil resistance and swelling
resistance against organic solvents.
EP-A-0 458 617 discloses a silicone rubber composition
comprising diorganopolysiloxanes having the unit CH2-CH2Rf
wherin Rf is a fluorine-containing organic group.Water- and oil-repellent base substances used in
cosmetic compositions are required to satisfy all such
conditions that (a) they have sufficient water and oil
repellency for sweat and sebum, (b) they are excellent in
emulsion stability and (c) they are not sticky to the touch
and good in feeling upon use.However, the above-described fluorine-modified
silicone compound does not fully satisfy these requirements,
in particular, oil repellency. Accordingly, there has been a demand for development
of a compound which is excellent
