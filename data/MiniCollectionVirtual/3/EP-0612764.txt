<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process
for preparing polyolefins and more particularly to a process
capable of initiating a polymerization reaction of olefins
stably while preventing the formation of a sheet-like
polymer in accordance with a vapor-phase polymerization
method and thereby preparing polyolefins efficiently.The vapor-phase polymerization method, which is
one method for preparing polyolefins, has recently been
becoming most popular as an olefin preparing process because
not only the removal of catalyst but also the removal and
recovery of solvent are not necessary and hence the
manufacturing cost is low. Usually, in a vapor-phase
polymerization method of a fluidized bed type, the heat of
polymerization generated in the polymerization reaction is
removed using the sensible heat of circulating gas, so it is
necessary that the polymer in the reactor be dispersed and
fluidized uniformly and to a satisfactory extent.
However, the polymer may be deposited on the reactor wall,
thermometer, etc. due to static electricity generated by the
friction between fluidized polymer particles or between
polymer particles and the reactor wall, thus resulting in 
that the heat cannot be removed to a satisfactory extent and
the polymer melts, causing the formation of agglomerated
polymer or sheet-like polymer, which may cause the polymer
withdrawing line to become closed and thus operation stopped.
Such a phenomenon is apt to occur when the interior of the
reaction system is in an unsteady state at the time of
start-up. As a method for preventing the generation of
static electricity in the vapor phase reactor there has been
proposed a method of adding, for example, water, alcohol,
oxygen, nitrogen oxide or ketone (Japanese Patent Laid Open
Nos. 230607/1989 and 145608/1990).
However, all of those compounds have the drawback of
deteriorating the polymerization activity.It is the object of the present invention to
remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks of the prior art. In
particular, to provide a method for preventing the formation
of a sheet-like polymer without deteriorating the
polymerization activity.The present invention resides in a process of
preparing a polyolefin by homopolymerizing or copolymerizing
olefin(s) substantially in a vapor phase condition and in the
presence of a catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component
and an organometallic compound of a Group I - IV metal in the Periodic Table, the solid catalyst component
containing at least (a) magnesium, (b) titanium,
vanadium or both and (c)
