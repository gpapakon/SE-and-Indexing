<ABSTRACT>
A method and an assembly for coating a board or paper web 
(5) with the help of an air knife (4) as the doctoring means 

comprising a first backing roll (1) which backs the web 
during the application of the coating mix to the web (5) and a 

second backing roll (3) around which the web (5) passes after 
the coat application and which backs the web during the 

smoothing of the coat with the help of the air knife (4). The 
invention is based on applying the coating mix to the web (5) 

with a correct thickness of the coat by means of a slot-orifice 
applicator apparatus (2). In the applicator apparatus (2) the 

coating mix flow is directed in a reverse direction to the 
travel of the web (5) and only a desired portion of the flow is 

allowed to adhere to the web (5), whereby the critical 
doctoring process in the region of the air knife (4) can be 

easily optimized under varying process conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1
for coating a board or paper web using an air knife as the doctoring means.The invention also concerns an assembly according to the preamble of claim 3 for
implementing said method.When using an air doctor, the coating mix applied to the web is smoothed by
directing a high-velocity air jet via a slot-orifice nozzle of the air doctor toward
the web. This air knife removes the excess coat from the web surface in the form
of a coat mist and this mist is collected into a purpose-designed blow-off hood
and recycled back to the coating mix pan. With the help of the air doctor, a
smooth coat is attained and the profile of the coated paper or paperboard web
follows the contour of the base web. The opacifying power of the applied coat is
good. However, this method is not suitable for applying high-solids coats.The greatest drawback of air doctoring is its inherently weak blow-off capability
of the excess coat which is further impaired at higher web speed. Consequently,
air doctoring must employ coating furnishes of low viscosity and solids content,
and yet the usable web speed remains smaller than 500 m/min even in the fastest
machines. For these reasons, air doctoring is used almost exclusively in board
coating where good opacifying power is imperative and high web speeds are not
as critical as in papermaking in general. If the viscosity or solids content of the
coating mix is increased, the air doctor looses its ability to blow off the excess
coat, and therefore, the finished coat weight becomes excessively heavy. Accordingly,
the requirements set for air doctor coating are that the applied coat weight
should be as smooth as possible and the weight of the applied coat should give the
desired finished coat weight with a sufficiently close tolerance. US-A-3,235,401 discloses an air doctor apparatus in which the web to be
coated is taken via a guide roll first to a metering roll of the applicator apparatus.
The metering roll is placed in the coating mix pan so that the lower part of the
roll is immersed in the pan, while the web runs over the upper part of the roll.
The metering roll lifts an excess amount of the mix from the pan to the web
which next passes over a rotating predoctoring rod that removes a portion of the
excess coat from the web. The purpose of the predoctoring rod is to smooth the
coat and remove so much of the excess coat that the air knife can then doctor the
coat to the desired finished coat weight. After the

A method for coating a moving web (5) such as a board or paper
web, comprising


taking the web (5) to a backing roll (1) and applying to the
web surface a coat by means of a slot-orifice applicator (2)

so that from
the slot-orifice (12) directly to the gap between the slot

orifice and the web is ejected a coating mix flow which is
permitted to adhere to the web (5) so as to form the applied

coat, in a layer with a weight very close to the finished
coat weight, whereas excess mix will spread in a reverse direction

to the travel of the web (5), and
doctoring said applied coating mix by means of an air knife
(4) adapted in conjunction with a backing roll (1,3),
characterized by
operating the slot-orifice coater (2) with an excess of mass
flow of the coating mix and directing said coating mix flow as a jet in the reverse

direction to the web travel and altering the jet direction
to the end of achieving the desired

coat weight, very close to the finished coat weight,
after which the web (5) is taken to a second backing roll (3)
for doctoring the coating mix by means of an air knife backed

by said second backing roll (3).
A method as defined in claim 1, 
characterized by

varying the local flow rate of the coating mix flow against the web (5) in a
controlled manner over the cross-machine direction of the web. 
An assembly for coating a moving web (5) such as a board or
paper web, said assembly comprising


at least one backing roll (1) around which the web (5) is
adapted to pass,
a slot-orifice applicator (2)
for applying the coating

mix in an amount very close to the desired coat weight
directly to the web in the gap formed between said slot-orifice

(12) and the web (5), and
an air knife (4) adapted in conjunction with a backing roll
(1,3) beside the web (5) to the end of doctoring the applied

coat,
characterized in that
 said applicator apparatus (2)
comprises


means (8) for directing the coating mix flow in the
reverse direction to the travel of the web (8)

including a slot orifice (12) directing a
jet in the reverse direction to the

web travel and means alter to
the jet direction to the end of adjustment

of the coat thickness very close to the desired coat weight,

whereby the coat quantity to be removed by the air doctor remains
small,
and a first (1) and a second backing roll (3) related to said
slot orifice applicator (2) and to said air knife (4) respectively.
An assembly as defined in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said
applicator apparatus comprises


an upper lip (17) adapted to the immediate vicinity of the web (5), and
a lower lip (23), which is placed close to the upper lip (17) essentially
noncontactingly outdistanced from the web (5), whereby said upper lip

(17) and said lower lip (23) form a slot orifice (12) suited for applying a

rounded shape at the tip of said upper lip (17) and the shape of said
lower lip (23) is curved to essentially confirmingly follow the rounded
