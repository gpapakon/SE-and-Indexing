<ABSTRACT>
A powder coating system comprises an enclosure (3) with an 
opening in a base portion thereof. The opening provides 

communication between the enclosure (3) and an excess powder 
collection receptacle positioned, in use, below the enclosure. 

The opening is closed by a vibrating sieve member (7). Excess 
powder accumulates in the base of the enclosure (3) and is 

sieved through the sieve member (7) into the collection 
receptacle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating, and in particular to
a powder coating system compring an enclosure.Powder coating is widely used for the application of coatings
or finishes to a wide variety of articles. Powder coating
systems generally comprise an enclosure within which the
article to be coated is mounted or suspended. The enclosure
serves to prevent escape of powder to the environment.
Extraction systems are provided to remove and capture excess
powder. These comprise fabric filters, cyclones or reverse
jet cartridge filters. In all cases, the spraying process
takes place under a reduced pressure generated by the
extraction system and the powder-laden air is intercepted at
some point external to the enclosure.All such known systems suffer from certain disadvantages.
They are, to varying degrees, mechanically complex. The
enclosures require regular cleaning, and very thorough
cleaning between uses of powders of differing colours. This
results in considerable periods of 'down-time'. The
alternative, viz dedicating each system to one colour only,
necessitates very considerable capital outlay in the provision
of multiple systems which furthermore occupy considerable
space.EP-A-375511,
which represents the prior art as referred to in the preamble of
claim 1,
discloses a powder coating system comprising an
enclosure with an opening in a base portion thereof, the opening
providing communication between the enclosure and an (implicit)
excess powder collection receptacle. The enclosure is of
flexible material such that the enclosure is capable of being
folded up.DD-A-270476 also discloses a powder coating system comprising an
enclosure with an opening in a base portion thereof, the opening 
providing communication between the enclosure and an excess
powder receptacle position, in use below the enclosure. A
vibrating sieve is positioned below the opening but is not
connected to the enclosure.There has now been devised a powder coating system which
overcomes or substantially mitigates these disadvantages.According to the invention, there is provided a powder coating
system comprising an enclosure with an opening in a base portion
thereof, at least the base portion of the enclosure being of
flexible material, said opening providing communication between
the enclosure and an excess powder collection receptacle
positioned, in use, below the enclosure, characterised in that
said opening is closed by a vibrating sieve member connected to
the base portion of the enclosure such that vibratory motion of

A powder coating system comprising an enclosure (3) with an
opening in a base portion thereof, at least the base portion of the

enclosure (3) being of flexible material, said opening providing
communication between the enclosure (3) and an excess powder collection

receptacle positioned, in use, below the enclosure, characterised in
that said opening is closed by a vibrating sieve member (7) connected

to the base portion of the enclosure (3) such that vibratory motion of
the sieve member (7) is transmitted thereto.
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the enclosure (3) is
entirely of flexible material and is capable of being folded up.
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the flexible material is
a fabric.
A system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the fabric is resistant to
the build-up of static charge.
A system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the fabric incorporates
carbon fibre threads which earth the surface of the fabric.
A system as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein the
fabric is coated with a material which reduces any tendency for powder

to build up on the internal walls of the enclosure.
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the enclosure is a
disposable enclosure made of paper
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the enclosure is partly of
a rigid material and partly of a flexible material.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising an
external framework (1) on which the enclosure (3) is supported.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein a receptacle
for sieved powder is provided below the vibrating sieve member (7).
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising an 
extraction unit (2) by which air is drawn through the enclosure (3).
A system as claimed in claim 11, wherein the extraction unit (2) draws
air through a filter which forms part of the enclosure (3).
A system as claimed in claim 12, wherein the extraction unit (2)
operates intermittently or periodically to reverse the flow of air through the

filter.
