<ABSTRACT>
Soft throughdried tissues, which are sufficiently soft to 
serve as premium bathroom tissues, can be made without the 

use of a Yankee dryer. The typical Yankee functions of 
building machine direction and cross-machine direction 

stretch are replaced by a wet end rush transfer and the 
throughdrying fabric design, respectively. It is 

particularly PREFERRED to form the tissue with 
chemimechanically treated fibers in at least one layer. The 

resulting tissues have high bulk (about 6 cubic centimeters 
per gram or greater) and low stiffness.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the manufacture of tissue products such as bath tissue, a wide variety of product characteristics must be given
attention in order to provide a final product with the appropriate blend of attributes suitable for the product's intended
purposes. Among these various attributes, improving softness has always been a major objective for premium products.
Major components of softness include stiffness and bulk (density), with lower stiffness and higher bulk (lower density)
generally improving perceived softness.Traditionally, tissue products have been made using a wet-pressing process in which a significant amount of water
is removed from a wet laid web by pressing or squeezing water from the web prior to final drying. In particular, while
supported by an absorbent papermaking felt, the web is squeezed between the felt and the surface of a rotating heated
cylinder (Yankee dryer) using a pressure roll as the web Is transferred to the surface of the Yankee dryer for final drying.
The dried web is thereafter dislodged from the Yankee dryer with a doctor blade (creping), which serves to partially
debond the dried web by breaking many of the bonds previously formed during the wet-pressing stages of the process.
Creping generally improves the softness of the web, albeit at the expense of a significant loss in strength.More recently, throughdrying has become a more prevalent means of drying tissue webs. Throughdrying provides
a relatively non compressive method of removing water from the web by passing hot air through the web until it is dry.
More specifically, a wet-laid web is transferred from the forming fabric to a coarse, highly permeable throughdrying
fabric and retained on the throughdrying fabric until it is dry. The resulting dried web is softer and builder than a wet-pressed
uncreped dried sheet because fewer papermaking bonds are formed and because the web Is less dense.
Squeezing water from the wet web is eliminated, although subsequent transfer of the web to a Yankee dryer for creping
is still used to final dry and/or soften the resulting tissue.EP-A-0 342 646 describes a process for making hand or wiper towels. A furnish of cellulosic fibers is formed which
is deposited on a travelling foraminous belt. Thereby, a fibrous web Is formed on the top of said belt. The fibrous web
is then transferred to a through-dryer to remove the remaining water before the web is wound onto a product roll.EP-A-0568404 published 03.11.93 and claiming priorities of 17.04.92 and 18.12.92 describes a method of treating

<CLAIMS>
A soft single-ply bath tissue comprising a layered, uncreped
throughdried tissue sheet having an air side layer comprising 80 weight

percent or greater curled eucalyptus fibers and a fabric side layer comprising
80 weight percent or greater curled eucalyptus fibers, said tissue having a

Bulk (as defined herein) of from 9 to 20 cubic centimeters per gram, a MD
Stiffness Factor (as defined herein) of from 50 to 100, and a machine

direction stretch of from 10 to 25 percent.
A method of making a soft uncreped throughdried tissue sheet,
comprising:


(a) forming an aqueous suspension of papermaking fibers having a
consistency of 20 percent or greater;
(b) mechanically working the aqueous suspension in a shaft
disperger preferably at 60°C (140°F) or greater to curl the fibers;
(c) diluting the aqueous suspension of curled fibers to a
consistency of 0.5 percent or less and feeding the diluted suspension to a

tissue-making headbox;
(d) depositing the diluted aqueous suspension of papermaking
fibers onto a forming fabric to form a wet web;
(e) dewatering the wet web preferably to a consistency of from 20
to 30 percent;
(f) transferring the wet web from the forming fabric to a transfer

fabric travelling at a speed from 10 to 80 percent slower than the forming
fabric, this transfer being optionally performed by two or more different

speed transfers using more than one transfer fabrics; 
(g) transferring the web to a throughdrying fabric whereby the web
is macroscopically rearranged to conform to the surface of the throughdrying

fabric; and
(h) non compressive drying the web to final dryness.
The process of Claim 2 wherein the aqueous suspension is
mechanically worked with a power input of about 746 Watt-day per ton

(about 1 horsepower-day per ton) of dry fiber or greater to curl the fibers.
The method of any one of Claims 2 or 3 wherein the fibers are surface
treated with a chemical softening agent.
The method of any one Claims 2 to 4 wherein the curled fibers are
eucalyptus fibers.
The method of any one of Claims 2 to 5 wherein the curled fibers are
deposited onto the forming fabric as one or two layers of a multiple layer web.
The method of any one of Claims 2 to 6 wherein the web comprises an
inner layer and two outer layers, at least one outer layer comprising the curled

fibers.
The method of Claim 7 wherein both outer layers comprise the curled
fibers.
The method of any one of Claims 2 to 8 wherein all of the fibers in the
web have been mechanically worked as set forth in step (b).
The method of any one of Claims 2 to 9 wherein the curled fibers are
deposited onto the forming fabric as the air side layer and the fabric side layer

of the web.
The method of any one of Claims 2 to 10 wherein the non
compressive drying step is a throughdrying step.
The soft tissue product of Claim 1 obtainable by the process of any 
one of the Claims 2 to 11.
