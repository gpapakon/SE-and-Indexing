<ABSTRACT>
Pressure charging apparatus, which may be a turbocharger or a supercharger, for an internal combustion engine comprises a pressure supply (4), a wastegate, a wastegate actuator (3) for closing and opening the wastegate in order to alter the pressure in the engine inlet, a boost control (1) for controlling the wastegate actuator, a boost control solenoid valve (2), a switchover valve (11), electronic control units (1 and 10) and a full throttle sensor. In operation, unit (10) receives signals, inter alia, from the sensor (13) to control valves (2 and 11) to positively shut the wastegate until an overboost threshold is reached thereby minimising boost lag during this period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pressure charging
apparatus for internal combustion engines.The pressure charging apparatus may be a
turbocharger or a supercharger in which, typically, in
one known arrangement, engine boost level is controlled
by a pneumatically controlled wastegate mechanism. The
engine boost level is defined as the pressure level,
relative to atmospheric, to which the turbocharger or
supercharger compresses the air charge in the inlet
manifold. The wastegate position, which controls the
boost level is in turn controlled by a controlling
pneumatic pressure which is regulated by a boost control
solenoid valve. The boost control solenoid valve, which
is fitted between the wastegate actuator mechanism and a
pressure source (or reservoir), is actuated by an
electrical control signal. This may be in the form of a
voltage, frequency or duty cycle. The boost control
solenoid valve is of a type where the full supply
pressure is diverted to the wastegate actuator to open it
fully (causing low engine boost) when a 'low' signal is
supplied to the solenoid. The full supply pressure is
diverted to vent away and no pressure reaches the
wastegate actuator (causing high engine boost), when a
'high' signal is supplied to the solenoid. The solenoid 
operation is infinitely variable between these two
extremes.The signal to the boost control solenoid valve is
usually supplied from an Electrical Control Unit (ECU),
which may use engine speed, boost pressure and engine
load amongst the incoming parameters. This enables the
boost pressure to be controlled as desired via the action
of the boost control solenoid valve. The ECU is
pre-programmed to provide the desired boost levels
dependent upon the incoming parameters. Additional
safeguards may be incorporated into the inputs to the
ECU, such that a low signal is sent to the boost control
solenoid valve under conditions of engine stress
(vibration or combustion detonation as examples) or for
reasons of vehicle safety inhibits (cruise control
operation, vehicle braking and gearchange operation are
examples).The existing arrangement is such that when a change
is made to the electrical signal to the boost control
solenoid valve, there is a delay before the wastegate
actuator assumes the new position. This delay is
dependent upon the control dynamics of the system such as
the length of pipes and volume of the wastegate actuator
and is generally engineered to be small. Under
conditions of a changing signal to the boost control 
solenoid valve, there may also be a
