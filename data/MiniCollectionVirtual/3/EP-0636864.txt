<ABSTRACT>
A positive displacement piston flowmeter (10) for measuring air flow comprising a 
hollow flowtube (12) preferably arranged in a vertical orientation, having a movable 

piston (14) disposed in the flowtube (12) for movement betweeen a starting position, 
preferably at the bottom end (16) of the piston stroke, and an elevated position at 

the top end (24) of the piston stroke. The piston (14) is reciprocated by means of a 
pressure relief control valve assembly (25) by means of a flexible string, which 

causes the piston (14) to automatically close the valve assembly for automatic 
operation on reaching the bottom end (16) of the piston stroke and to reverse 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The accurate measurement of ambient fluid (air) flow is 
becoming increasingly more important in the application and control of 
many processes, as well as in the research laboratory. One of the major 
applications is in the field of air sampling, where an accurate knowledge 
of the sampled air quality determines the exposure level to various 
contaminants. The most widely accepted primary standard method for 
a gaseous fluid is the bubble flow meter. In the basic form of the 
bubble flow meter, a soap film is generated from a soap solution, and 
is propelled by the gas flow under measurement from one end of the 
flow meter to the other. By timing the rise of the soap film between 
calibrated volume marks, the volume flow is obtained. Since for all 
practical purposes, the soap film is massless, it requires almost no 
force to accelerate the bubble. Furthermore, a seal is always insured by 
the presence of the bubble. The very nature of the bubble eliminates  
 
the friction which is associated with a piston type flow meter. The 
soap film flow meter is essentially transparent to the flow being 
measured, having a no-load effect. Accordingly, the soap film flow 
meter comes closest to meeting the unique requirements of the ideal 
calibrator. The measurement of air flow using a positive displacement 
reciprocating piston flow meter is susceptible to errors based on the 
following requirements: 
1- Initial breakaway friction; 2- Acceleration and deceleration of the piston after 
breakaway (until equilibrium is reached); 3- Running friction; and 4- Fixed pressure loading determined by the mass of the 
piston. The resolution of the above conditions presents a load to 
the air flow system being measured. The arrangement of the present 
invention minimizes the initial breakaway friction and acceleration 
forces of the piston on reversing its direction at the bottom of the 
piston stroke and, if desired, permits automatic operation without an 
external power source. An additional advantage of the positive 
displacement piston flow meter of the present invention is its simplicity 
in design for reversing the direction of the piston on both the upstroke 
and downstroke of the piston.  An improved positive displacement piston flow meter for 
measuring air flow has been developed in accordance with the present 
invention, preferably using a vertically oriented flow meter assembly 
having a movable piston disposed within a precision bore flowtube, for 
movement from a starting position at or near the bottom end of

<CLAIMS>
A positive piston flow meter for use in measuring 
air flow comprising: 


(a) a hollow flowtube vertically orientated to form 
a top end and a bottom end, and having a movable piston 

disposed therein for movement between said top and 
bottom end, respectively; 
(b) inlet means for connecting one end of said 
flowtube to an external pump, with said flowtube having 

ingress and egress to the ambient atmosphere from at 
least one end thereof ; 
(c) means for detecting said piston as it moves past 
at least two predetermined positions along said flowtube 

from which air flow through said flowtube can be measured; 
and 
(d) a pressure relief control assembly for controlling 
the ascent and descent of the piston in said flowtube, 

said pressure relief control assembly comprising: a 
housing, a chamber within the interior of said housing, 

and a poppet valve for interconnecting said said flowtube 
to said chamber, with said poppet valve having a first 

position for providing a first flow path to said inlet means 
 

from said top end of said flowtube to cause said piston to 
rise, and a second position for providing a second flow 

path from said chamber to said inlet means to cause said 
piston to fall; and with said poppet valve, including a 

valve stem extending into said flowtube for engaging said 
piston when said piston reaches a fixed position adjacent 

the top end of the flowtube, whereby said poppet valve 
is automatically switched into said second position to 

permit said piston to descend by gravity from the top end 
of said flowtube; latching means for holding said poppet 

valve in a fixed position after said piston and said valve 
stem have disengaged, and means for resetting the 

poppet valve into said first position.

wherein said means for resetting the poppet valve is a manually operated 

switch. 
A positive piston flow meter, as defined in claim 1, 
wherein said flow meter is automatically operated, with said means for 

resetting said poppet valve comprising a flexible string, physically 
connecting said poppet valve and said piston. 
A positive piston flow meter, as defined in claim 3, 
wherein said latch means comprises a permanent magnet mounted in 

said valve stem, and means for holding a steel member in a stationary 
position relative to said magnet. 
A positive piston flow meter as defined in claim 4, 
wherein the position of said means for holding said steel member is 

adjustable to vary the position of said steel member relative to said 
magnet. 
A positive piston flow meter as defined in claim 4, 
wherein said flexible string is connected at one end to a member 

mounted in a compression spring extending from said valve stem such 
that said flexible string is suspended from said compression spring. 
A positive piston flow meter as defined in claim 6 
wherein said compression spring has a free end extending into said 

flowtube with the position of said member in said compression spring 
being adjustable relative to said free end. 
A positive piston flow meter, as defined in claim 6, 
wherein said poppet valve further comprises a flexible valve head, a
