The switch device relates to an installation with parallel lines for pneumatic transfer of containers which include a protuberance at the level of the neck; it comprises a fixed apron (13) and a rotary circular platform (14), comprising a set of transfer-line portions which are connected to the rotary platform in a radial direction, some having an end which is curved radially. The rotary circular platform (14) comprises a diametrical portion (19) and two outer portions (20, 21). It is equipped with pivoting means capable of causing the rotary platform (14) to adopt predetermined positions in which all or part of the upstream and downstream portions of the fixed apron (13) are made to coincide by virtue of all or part of the switch portions of the rotary platform (14).
