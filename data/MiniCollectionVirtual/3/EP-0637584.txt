<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing stabilized crude acetonitrile (i.e. 
acetonitrile which has been treated to substantially eliminate 

polymerization of the acetonitrile upon vaporization) which comprises 
mixing crude acetonitrile, a strong base and aldehyde together, heating to 

the reflux temperature of the mixture to stabilize the crude acetonitrile 
and recovering the stabilize acetonitrile. This stabilized acetonitrile is 

utilized to manufacture hydrogen cyanide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the upgrading of stablized crude
acetonitrile obtained by the process described below by catalytic treatment in a
fluid bed reactor to produce hydrogen cyanide.The manufacture of acrylonitrile by the direct reaction of
propylene, ammonia and air over a catalyst in a fluid bed reactor is
recognized worldwide and referred to as the "Sohio Acrylonitrile Process".
In addition to the manufacture of acrylonitrile, the Sohio Acrylonitrile
Process produces coproducts such as acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide.
Acetonitrile is a known commercial solvent. Hydrogen cyanide is an
important substance which is frequently employed as a starting material
for various organic reactions. Any improvements in the yields of these
coproducts or upgrading of these coproducts would enhance the economic
value of the Sohio Acrylonitrile Process.Various patents disclose processes for the manufacture of
hydogen cyanide by reacting acetonotrile over ammoxidation or oxidation
catalyst. For example, U.S. Patent 3,516,789 discloses a process for the
manufacture of hydogen cyanide by reacting acetonitrile over an
ammoxidation catalyst. This patent discloses that the feed of
acetonitrile is purified to remove all impurities such as acrylonitrile
and hydrogen cyanide. Japan Patent Kokai 73 81816 (CA80:108016a)
discloses purification of acetonitrile by adding alkali, heating, treating
with formaldehyde and distilling to remove HCN, acrylonitrile, etc. U.S. 
Patent 4328075 relates to the removal of cyanides from a crude aqueous
acetonitrile stream by the addition of caustic and aldehyde. US Patent 3,911,089
discloses the preparation of hydrogen cyanide by the addition of methanol to the
ammoxidation reactor used during the production of acrylonitrile. The addition of
the methanol increases the yield of hydrogen cyanide. German Patent 1,146,861
discloses hydrogen cyanide production by the reaction of acetonitrile with
molecular oxygen over an ammoxidation catalyst. Belgium Patent 623, 100
discloses the reaction of acetonitrile over an ammoxidation catalyst to produce
hydrogen cyanide.It has been observed that the direct vaporization of crude
acetonitrile results in substantial plugging or fouling of the apparatus
making the commercial practice of the process quite difficult. In U.S.
Patent 4,981,670 assigned to the assignees of the present application,
crude acetonitrile is used as a source for the direct formation of
hydrogen cyanide. A polymerization inhibiting agent is added to eliminate
plugging and
