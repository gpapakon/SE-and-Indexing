<ABSTRACT>
The panel is set in vibration by an excitor (22) and changes in the pattern of vibration due to the loading or damping of the panel by an attached device are detected. The input from piezoelectric detectors is passed by amplifier (12) and analog-to-digital converter (13) to a microprocessor (14). Under control of programs held by EPROM (16) the inputs from successive test cycles are analyzed and compared to determine whether a significant change in the condition of the panel has recurred, in which case an alrm is given by an indicator (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns equipment for detecting a 
device, such as a car bomb, attached to a panel of a vehicle or 
the like. Such an equipment is known from JP-A-59-20819. Car bombs are the most efficient way which terrorists 
have devised to kill or maim their victims. It is a method 
which is used frequently in Northern Ireland. Except on 
relatively rare occasions these devices have been attached to the 
vehicle by quite powerful permanent magnets. Several systems 
relying on the detection of the magnetic fields emitted by the 
magnets have been devised to detect these bombs. Clearly, these 
systems can only detect those devices which have been attached 
magnetically and are thus extremely limited in scope. The present invention seeks to overcome this 
disadvantage. It senses the change in the mechanical properties 
of the car panel to which the bomb is attached. It does not 
depend on the magnetic properties of the explosive device. In accordance with the invention there is provided 
equipment 
according to claim 1. When a membrane such as a metal plate is caused to 
vibrate certain frequencies will predominate. The amplitude and 
frequency of the displacements depend on the tension in, and the 
mass per unit area of the membrane. If an extra mass is attached to the membrane both these 
quantities will change. If, on the other hand, an external force 
is applied to the membrane, caused perhaps by an object being 
pressed against it, the tension in the membrane will change, also  
 
the vibrations will be differently damped. The vibrational 
pattern will be altered as a result. The invention utilises these principles by considering 
the floor pan of the vehicle as a membrane under tension. The 
floor-pan is forced into vibration. The pattern of vibrations is 
detected, analysed and stored in microprocessor memory. This 
process is repeated at certain predetermined intervals and the 
vibration patterns correlated with one another. A sudden change 
in this correlation indicates a change in the mass, the tension, 
or vibrational damping of the vehicle's floor-pan. This is 
interpreted and a warning given if suitable criteria are met. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by 
way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the electronic circuitry of 
a car-bomb detector, and Fig. 2 is a flow chart of the operations performed by the 
circuitry. The structure of the vehicle can be set into vibration 
either mechanically or by

<CLAIMS>
Equipment for detecting a foreign body in contact with 
an object comprising excitor means (22) for exciting 

vibrations in the object, a detector for detecting the vibrations, 
and analysis means (14, 16) for monitoring 

differences between the detected vibrations in the presence 
and absence of a foreign body, characterized by control means 

(23, 24) for repeatedly energizing the excitor means (22), 
the analysis means (14, 16) being arranged to establish a 

vibrational pattern for each energization of the excitor 
means (22) representing the frequency and amplitude of the 

detected vibrations of the object, a store (15) for holding 
the vibrational patterns from the analysis means, comparison 

means (14, 16) for comparing successive vibrational patterns 
with a normal pattern held in the store (15) to detect 

changes due to loading of the object by the foreign body, and 
an alarm means (25) triggered when the comparison means 

indicate a change in successive vibrational patterns meeting 
predetermined criteria.  

 
Equipment as claimed in claim 1 in which in a 
first series of test cycles an average base level or 

normal vibration pattern is established and in subsequent 
cycles a specimen vibration pattern is determined and 

compared with the normal pattern. 
Equipment as claimed in claim 2 in which by 
comparison of each specimen pattern with the normal 

pattern a figure of merit is established representing the 
dissimilarity between the two patterns and the extent of 

any change in this figure of merit from one test cycle to 
another is used to decide on the triggering of the alarm. 
Equipment as claimed in claim 2 or 3 in which 
the stored values for the normal pattern are up-dated by 

reference to the specimnen values when these diverge from 
the stored values without reaching a level which results  

 
in triggering of the alarm. 
Equipment as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the exciting means comprise a piezoelectric 

device. 
Equipment as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the detecting means are piezo-electric 

crystals.
