<ABSTRACT>
An improved automatic mop for cleaning floors consisting of 
a bucket (4) located on a platform (2) fitted with free turning wheels 

(3), having collaterally or about itself a body acting as a frame 
within which one or two motors fed by a battery or accumulator 

with a recharge intake are arranged, having also pilot lights, 
switches, relay and fuse, which, by pressing a push-button, 

collaterally located driven by the mop stick or thru a magnet, 
move some vanes acting directly on textile fibers forming the 

mop or scrubber, squeezing its liquid contents and this falling 
within a bucket through a pluriperforated reversed truncated-cone (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to an automatic mop device 
for cleaning floors, the purpose of which is to help an user to 
clean a surface such as a floor, by substantially reducing the own 
user's effort as it makes easy to squeeze dry a mop or the fringes 
of a mop, located at the lower end of a supporting stick, such 
as a broomstick. This invention applies to the industry devoted to the manufacture 
of industrial and domestic appliances. It is known a large variety of elongated cylindrical shaped bodies 
having, or not, non-slipping areas on their surface in order 
to facilitate their use, since the function of these areas is to 
avoid the stick to slide out of an user's hands, and these sticks 
are made of wood, wood coated with a plastic film, stiff plastic 
material, lightened metal, and so on. All these sticks had, at one end, a receiving body, at first, 
formed by a duster or floorcloth, which, incorporated and bonded 
in its surface, carried out a cleaning operation, said surface 
having been previously wetted thanks to the optional cooperation 
of a cleaning product or detergent. After the first cleaning operation by wetting the surface to 
be cleaned, the user should remove the duster or floorcloth, squeze  
 
it dry, and locate it on the corresponding portion of the 
stick situated at one of its ends in order to perform the drying 
operation of the previously water-wetted surface in cooperation 
with a cleaning product or not. In a most recent date, parts made of a light material have 
been incorporated in the ends of a stick, said parts having a 
plurality of filiform elements securely united, made of a textile 
material being capable of receiving a large amount of water 
and transferring it to the surface to be cleaned, these devices 
being known as mops or scrubbers. Subsequent to the first cleaning operation aided by a large 
amount of water used for performing the surface cleaning, the 
mop or scrubber was squeezed dry to remove the water carried 
by it, and then it was necessary to carry out a second operation 
in order to remove the water from the already cleaned surface. Of course, appreciable novelties have been incorporated in 
these elements mounted on the stick ends, as for the material, 
giving them a greater wear resistance, a large amount of water 
content and, consequently, a higher drying capacity, giving them 
different shapes, but always having the common denominator of 
being made starting from a textile material, the main bodies - 
being formed as a plurality of

<CLAIMS>
An automatic mop device for cleaning floors, comprising a 
stick or holder being markedly elongated and cylindrical, made of 

any material, said stick or holder receiving, at one of its ends, a part 
formed by fringes made of a textile material and capable of 

absorbing liquids, a bucket (4) or receptacle, of any material or 
shape, a platform (2) acting as a base having below it free 

turning wheels (3) which allow the device to be transported, the 
platform (2) having, on a side, a casing (15) which houses an electric 

motor, characterized by the electric motor being fitted with an end-of-stroke 
switch, a 12V battery for feeding electric power to the 

motor and the relative connections, the casing (15) having, on a side, 
a first arm composed of two lengths (7-7'), which are hinged at a 

point (16), the first arm being fitted with a handle or holder (13) and 
a sliding tube (8), the function of the tube (8) being to fix both 

lengths (7-7'), a second arm (5) emerging from the center end of the 
casing (15), having at its lower middle part a complementary 

squeezing arm (9), incorporated in the squeezing area of the bucket 
(4) located on the platform (2), the second arm (5) having at one end 

a switch (6) acting in cooperation with the mop stick; in particular, a 
bucket (22) stiffened by oversize at its perimeter, on which there is 

located a squeezing head (25) fixed thereto by conventional means, 
inside of which there are arranged acting elements, which are set in 

operation by pressing the mop stick on a switch (29) located on the 
front end of the casing formed by the squeezing head (25), which 

has, in the middle portion, a recess (28) in which the switch (29) is 
located, which acts on a relay and, then, on the rest of the 

mechanisms until operating the end-of-stroke switch, setting in 
operation external arms or vanes (27) which are set in motion 

towards inside a basket (30) on which the mop has previously been 
located; in particular, a casing or squeezing head (42)being fixed to the upper 

portion of a conventional bucket (43), having anchoring flanges (19) 
located at the back and lower part of same, and having lower 

shoulders (60), in particular being fitted with emerging stubs (58) to 
be fixed to the inner wall of the carrier bucket (43), the casing or 

squeezing head (42) having a grating (49) acting as a filter, there 
being inside the casing or squeezing head (42) two motors and two 

gear assemblies laterally arranged, both motors being driven by two  
 

batteries, having a pilot light (57) to indicate the recharge operation 
of the batteries when required, the pluriperforated basket acting as a 

filter and being configured as a basket (79), in particular being fitted 
with two vanes (76) emerging from the inner wall, and the mop stick 

having a magnet (85), which, when approaching the front end of the 
casing, enables a microswitch moving the vanes (76) for a 

predetermined period of time, controlled by a timer located within 
the casing or squeezing head (42).  

 
An automatic mop device according to 
claim 1, characterized in that on the external surface of the casing 

(15), a base (10) has been arranged for incorporating a battery 
charger, a main switch (14), and a fuseholder of 15 amperes 

(12), the casing (15) being fixed to the platform (2) by means of 
screws (11). 
An automatic mop device according to 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the motor has its motion limited 

in a predetermined time for performing the squeezing of the 
fringes, while the rest time is determined by an 

end-of-stroke switch reversing the motor polarity and changing its 
turning sense, the end-of-stroke switch being configured by a notch that, 

when open, reverses the motor polarity,the arm returning to its  
 

rest position,allowing to reset the squeezing operation by pressing 
the switch (6). 
An automatic mop device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that on one of the external surfaces 

of the squeezing head there is located a pilot (34) indicating 
that the battery or accumulator are being recharged through 

a flexible electric cable connected to the mains, relying on a 
main switch (32), setting in operation a pilot light (31) to inindicate 

the starting of the automatic mop device, and having a protection 
fuse (33). 
An automatic mop device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that when having two motors, these 

will turn in one sense or another, depending on the sense in which 
they receive the battery current, this actuation being determined 

by a relay operated by a switch (59) and having an end-of-stroke 
switch, the switch (59) being enabled by the mop holder 

or handle.
