<ABSTRACT>
A metal suspension arm (1) for axles of commercial vehicles, especially trucks and drawn trailers or semi-trailers, is supported by a free end designed as a suspension arm eye (2) so that it can swivel on a pivot pin (18) held in two lateral cheeks (20, 21) of a bearing bracket on the chassis side. The two annular side faces (12) of the suspension arm eye (2) facing the inside of the respectively adjoining lateral cheek (20, 21) of the bearing bracket are continuously tapered upwards and downwards in two dimensions from their inner circumference (13) to their outer circumference (14).

<CLAIMS>
A suspension arm (1) of metal for axles of industrial 
vehicles, in particular lorries and towed or semi-mounted 

trailers with a free end constructed as a suspension lug (2) 
which, when the suspension arm (1) is installed, is 

supported for pivoting movement on a mounting bolt (18) 
supported in two side webs (20, 21) of a bearing block on 

the vehicle chassis, the two annular side faces (12) facing 
the inside of whichever is the adjacent side web (20, 21) of 

the bearing block having continuously tapering portions 
extending from their inner periphery (13) to their outer 

periphery (14), characterised in that the suspension lug (2) 
comprises a guide portion (7) of the suspension arm (1) 

which extends as a prolongation of the suspension part (3) 
on both sides of the circular opening (6) in the lug and 

which is kept free of the tapering and in that the 
continuous surface tapering occurs only in the segment-shaped 

areas above and below the guide portion (7). 
A suspension arm according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the angle (α) of taper is in the range from 3 to 10° in 

respect of a perpendicular (5) to the longitudinal axis (16) 
of the suspensionn lug (2). 
A suspension arm according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that it consists of flat steel strip, the 

suspension lug (2) being formed by a ring integrally formed 
on a free end of the steel strip. 
A suspension arm according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the thickness of the steel strip is 10 to 40 mm.  

 
A suspension arm according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that it consists of a profiled steel bar, the 

suspension lug (2) being a separately produced component 

which is rigidly connected, and is in particular welded, to 
a free end of the profiled bar. 
A suspension arm according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the suspension lug (2) has its inner 

periphery (13) supported on a rubber sleeve (4), this in 
turn being supported on a metal bearing sleeve (5) enclosing 

the bearing bolt (18). 
A suspension arm according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the bearing sleeve (5) comprises, extending at right-angles 

to its longitudinal axis (16), annular end faces (10) 
for bearing on inside faces orientated parallel therewith 

and being provided on intermediate discs (24) in the bearing 
block. 
A suspension arm according to claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that, in the normal position, the annular end 

faces (11) of the rubber sleeve (4) are situated inside an 
annular enveloping surface (17) which extends the lateral 

surfaces (12) of the clearing lug (2) towards the bearing 
sleeve (5).
