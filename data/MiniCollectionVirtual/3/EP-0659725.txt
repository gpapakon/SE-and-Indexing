<ABSTRACT>
Aldehydes having 8 to 17 carbon atoms in the molecule which are substituted in the  alpha -position by an alkyl radical are obtained from the terminal olefins having one carbon atom less. To this end, the olefins are first isomerised in the presence of iron carbonyl and thereupon hydroformylated in the presence of rhodium as catalyst without removing the iron compound.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing aldehydes having from 8 to 
17 carbon atoms and substituted in the α position by 

an alkyl radical by means of hydroformylation of 
olefins having from 7 to 16 carbon atoms and an 

internal double bond, which comprises isomerizing 
olefins having a predominantly terminal double bond 

at from 160 to 210°C in the liquid phase in the 
presence of iron carbonyl and, without separating 

off the isomerization catalyst, hydroformylating the 
isomerization mixture at from 80 to 200°C and a 

pressure of from 5 to 50 MPa in the presence of 
rhodium as catalyst. 
The process is claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
isomerization is carried out in the presence of from 

50 to 1000 ppm by weight, preferably from 200 to 

500 ppm by weight, of iron carbonyl, based on 
olefin. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
isomerization is carried out at from 170 to 190°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the hydroformylation is carried out in 

the presence of from 1 to 20 ppm by weight, 
preferably from 2 to 5 ppm by weight, of rhodium, 

based on olefin. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the hydroformylation is carried out at 

temperatures of from 120 to 150°C. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the hydroformylation is carried out at 

pressures of from 20 to 30 MPa.
