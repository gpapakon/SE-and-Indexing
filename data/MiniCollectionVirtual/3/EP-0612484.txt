<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a tensioning lever (1) which acts on at least one tension member, such as a cable (12). The tensioning lever is designed so that the point of attachment (11) of the cable moves on the tensioning lever when the latter is rotated, and so that this attachment point coincides with the axis (2) of articulation of the tensioning lever after a defined angle of rotation of the tensioning lever from one of its stable positions. This construction allows perfect control of the course of the attachment point. In the case when the tensioning lever has two functions, that is to say that it acts on two cables, this construction allows the functions to be sequenced.

Device for closing and tightening a ski boot comprising 
a tension lever (1;14) articulated on a support intended to 

be fixed on a part of the boot and at least one traction 
organ (12;16) intended to be linked to another part of the 

boot and linked to the tension lever by a part (11;18) 
transversal to said tension lever, the tension lever being 

formed in such a way that the attachment point of the 
traction organ moves on the tension lever, relatively to 

the articulation axis (2) of the tension lever, between two 
limits, during rotation of the tension lever around its 

articulation axis, characterised in that the tension lever 
(1;14) is so conformed that the attachment point (11;18) of 

the traction organ coincides with the articulation axis (2) 
of the tension lever after a determined rotation angle of 

the tension lever around its articulation axis (2) from one 
of its stable positions. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
tension lever presents two longitudinal parallel grooves 

(10) one end of which coincides with the articulation axis 
(2) of the tension lever and in that the transversal part 

(11) of the traction organ is maintained in said grooves 
such that its axis coincides at least approximately with 

the rotation axis (2) of the tension lever when it is at 
said end. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the traction organ 
(16) is linked to the tension lever (14) such that the 

tension lever operates a traction on said organ during its 
opening, characterised in that the tension lever (14) 

presents a receptacle (19) open on the upper side of the  
 

tension lever and having a depression (23) in which the 
transversal part of the traction organ is retained in the 

closed position of the tension lever and until an opening 
of the tension lever comprised between a rotation of 90Â° 

and its completely open position. 
Device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that it comprises a second traction organ (9) 

articulated on a point of the tension lever, the distance 
of which to the articulation axis of the tension lever 

being invariable.
