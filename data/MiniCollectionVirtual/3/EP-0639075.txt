 SPECIFIC INHIBITION OF DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE AND COMPOUNDS THEREFORDescription Technical Field This invention relates to pharmacology and the inhibition of enzymes specific to pathogens. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for spe¬ cifically inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in fungal pathogens, and compounds therefor.Background of the InventionPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is a significant, life-threatening infection in immunocompromised subjects, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients presenting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since the onset of the ADDS epidemic, the incidence of PCP has risen from apprOaXimately 200 cases per year to more than 25,000 cases per year in the United States.Due to the lack of a continuous in vitro culture system, and the cumber¬ some nature of the rat model of PCP, anti-P. carinii therapy has been developed largely on the assumption that P. carinii was a species of protozoa, and thus that anti-protozoal agents were likely to be effective. The two principle therapeutic mxx ities, trimemopriin/sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, were developed empirically. However, P. carinii has recently been suggested to belong instead to the Kingdom Fungi (J.C. Edman et_ύ., Nature (1988) 334:519-22). 

 Trimethoprim (U.S. Pat No. 2,909,522) and pyrimethamine, and other dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors are known to be effective anti-bacterial, and anti-protozo.al agents due to the central role played by DHFR in the metabolic synthesis of nucleic acid precursors. Despite their efficacy when used in con- junction with a sulfonamide, trimethoprim and pyrimethamine are alone poor inhibitors of P. carinii DHFR. For example, trimethoprim and pyrimethamine exhibit 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 8 and 2,500 nM for E. coli DHFR, while ICJQS for P. carinii DHFR are 39,600 and 2,400 nM, respectively. Other anti-folates have been shown to be more effective inhibitors of P. carinii DHFR, but require concomitant administration of leucovorin to prevent toxicity to the host. Allegra et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,007) suggested treatment of P. carinii and Toxoplasmosis gondii with 2,4-diaιnino-5-memyl-6-[(3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)- methyl]quinazoline (trimetrexate), on the theory that the DHFR enzyme in this pathogens is more similar to mammalian DHFR than to prokaryotic DHFR. Prior to the ADDS epidemic, these types of agents were sufficient for treatment of the rare cases of P. carinii pneumonia. However, in the
