<ABSTRACT>
The part of the boot concerned, in particular an inner-shoe (bootee) tongue for a ski boot, consists essentially of a leaktight, semirigid plastic outer part (1) having an alveolar structure (6) directly covered by a foam-type padding (4) and of a woven or knitted lining (5). The air enclosed in the cavities of the alveolar structure forms a shock-absorbing pad (padding) which is particularly effective in dynamic compression.

<CLAIMS>
A part of a boot, other than the sole, in particular
part of an inner boot for a ski boot, essentially

constituted by an outer part (1) made of impermeable
semirigid plastic, by a foam-type padding (4) and by a

woven or knitted liner (5), characterized in that the
inner face of the outer part (1) is alveolate open (6,

6') and that it is directly covered by the padding (4).
The part of a boot as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the padding (4) is constituted by

an open-cell foam.
The part of a boot as claimed in claim 1 to 2,
characterized in that it is exclusively constituted by

the alveolate outer part, by a foam layer and by the
woven or knitted liner.
The part of a boot as claimed in anyone of the
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the alveolate

structure is a honeycomb structure (6).
The part of a boot as claimed in anyone of the
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the alveolate

structure is a waffle configuration (6').
