<ABSTRACT>
A camera comprising light receiving means for receiving light 
through a photographing lens from a first and a second area on 

an object field and generating a plurality of light intensity 
distribution signals corresponding to said first and said 

second areas, said first area being extended in a horizontal 
direction and said second area being extended in a vertical 

direction when said camera is held in a horizontal attitude, 
focus condition detecting means responsive to said light 

receiving means for detecting a focus condition of said 
photographing lens, attitude detecting means for detecting that 

said camera is held in a vertical attitude to produce an 
attitude signal, said focus condition detecting means being 

responsive to light from said first area and not being 
responsive to light from said second area when said attitude 

signal is produced, and exposure calculating means for 
calculating an exposure value based on a brightness of an 

object field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a camera including an exposure 
calculating means for calculating an exposure value based on a 
brightness of an object field determined by light receiving 
means. It is significant in setting a proper exposure to obtain 
information relating to a type of a principal object, for 
example, an object to be photographed by close-up, person or 
scenery, as information for the calculation of exposure. In 
U.S. Serial No. 277,867 filed on November 30, 1988 and assigned 
to the assignee of the present invention, the principal object 
is classified by a photographing magnification and a proper 
exposure is calculated based on the classification result. More 
specifically, when the magnification f/x is smaller than 1/100, 
it is classified as a scenery scene, when the magnification is 
1/100 ≦ f/x < 1/20  
, it is classified as a person scene, and 
when the magnification is 
1/20 ≦ f/x  
, it is classified as a 
close-up scene. After the classification, appropriate 
calculation is effected to calculate the exposure. In the prior art, the classification of the scene is based on 
the assumption that the scene has a large number in a 
collection of statistics. However, a different scene from the 
statistically set scene classification naturally occurs in a 
range. Accordingly, in the scene classification method, a 
certain range of misjudgement is included by probability.  It is an object of the present invention to improve a 
probability of attaining a proper exposure. This object is achieved by a camera comprising light receiving 
means for receiving light through a photographing lens from a 
first and a second area on an object field and generating a 
plurality of light intensity distribution signals corresponding 
to said first and said second areas, said first area being 
extended in a horizontal direction and said second area being 
extended in a vertical direction when said camera is held in a 
horizontal attitude, focus condition detecting means responsive 
to said light receiving means for detecting a focus condition 
of said photographing lens, attitude detecting means for 
detecting that said camera is held in a vertical attitude to 
produce an attitude signal, said focus condition detecting 
means being responsive to light from said first area and not 
being responsive to light from said second area when said 
attitude signal is produced, and exposure calculating means for 
calculating an exposure value based on a brightness of an 
object field.  Fig. 1 shows a block

<CLAIMS>
A camera comprising: 
light receiving means for receiving light through a 

photographing lens (1) from a first and a second area on 
an object field and generating a plurality of light 

intensity distribution signals corresponding to said 
first and said second areas, said first area being 

extended in a horizontal direction and said second area 
being extended in a vertical direction when said camera 

is held in a horizontal attitude; 
focus condition detecting means (4) responsive to said 

light receiving means for detecting a focus condition of 
said photographing lens; 

attitude detecting means (10) for detecting that said 
camera is held in a vertical attitude to produce an 

attitude signal, said focus condition detecting means 
being responsive to light from said first area and not 

being responsive to light from said second area when 
said attitude signal is produced; and 

exposure calculating means (13) for calculating an 
exposure value based on a brightness of an object field. 
A camera according to claim 1, wherein said selecting 
means (12) selects the part of said plurality of light 

intensity distribution signals corresponding to said 
first area when said attitude signal indicates that said 

camera is held in a horizontal attitude, and wherein 
 

said selecting means selects the part of said plurality 
of light intensity distribution signals corresponding to 

said second area when said attitude signal indicates 
that said camera is held in a vertical attitude. 
A camera according to one of the claims 1 or 2, wherein 
said light receiving means (3, 8) receives light through 

a photographic lens (1) in two areas (3a, 3b; 3c, 3d) 
corresponding to two areas in the object field and 

generates the plurality intensity distribution signals 
corresponding to said two areas, one (3a, 3b) of these 

two areas being extended in a horizontal direction and 
the other (3c, 3d) of said two areas being extended in a 

vertical direction when the camera is held in a 
horizontal position. 
A camera according to claim 3, wherein said focus 
condition detecting means (4) is only responsive to 

light from one of said first and second areas (3a, 3b; 
3c, 3d) when said attitude signal is produced. 
A camera according to claim 4, wherein said focus 
condition detecting means (4) preselects the part of the

corresponding to said first area (3a, 3b) when said 

attitude signal indicates that said camera is held in a 
horizontal position, and wherein said condition 

detecting means (4) preselects the part of said 
plurality of light intensity distribution signals 

corresponding to said second area (3c, 3d) when said 
attitude signal indicates that said camera is held in a 

vertical position.
