<ABSTRACT>
The joint prosthesis, while permitting movements about several degrees of freedom, also benefits from a simple design and from a low production cost. It comprises in particular a female fork (21) having two half-shafts (26, 27) of rotation. A male piece (23) comprises two corresponding lateral surfaces (24A, 24B). One of the half-shafts (27) has a diameter smaller than that of the other one (26) and can move on an elongated lateral surface (24B) in order to permit at least one additional movement of rotation of one phalanx with respect to the other. Application to metacarpo-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints.

<CLAIMS>
Joint prosthesis comprising two components (11,
13, 21, 23, 51, 53) which can be implanted in the bones

(7B, 9B) of the joint and forming a pivot joint, the
prosthesis comprising:


a first component consisting of a female
bracket (12, 22, 52) provided with two aligned orifices

(12B) and integral with a first diaphysial part (7,
57)
;
a second component consisting of a male
bracket (15, 25, 55) cooperating with the female

bracket and integral with a second diaphysial part (9,
59),
two half-pins (16, 26, 27) mounted by force
in the orifices (12B) of this female bracket, the two

ends (16A, 26A, 27A) placed facing one another are
spherical,
the male bracket having two opposite concave
side faces (24A, 24B) for each receiving one of the

said facing ends, and of which a first side face (24A)
is spherical and of the same radius as that of the end

of the corresponding half-pin (16, 26),

characterized in that the diameter of the half-pin (26)
corresponding to the first spherical concave face (24A)

is greater than the diameter of the half-pin (27)
corresponding to the second face (24B) permitting at

least one movement of translation.
Joint prosthesis according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the two opposite side faces of 

the male bracket (25, 55) are formed in a cylindrical
bearing component (24) engaged by force in an orifice

of the male bracket (25, 55).
Joint prosthesis according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the male bracket (25, 55) has a

first spherical concave side face (24A) and a second
concave side face (24B), of which the shape is the

envelope of a movement of translation of the spherical
end (27A) of the corresponding half-pin (27).
Joint prosthesis according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the male bracket (25, 55) has a

first spherical concave side face (24A) and a second
concave side face, of which the shape is the envelope

of two perpendicular movements of translation of the
spherical end of the corresponding half-pin.
Joint prosthesis according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the male bracket (25, 55) has at

least one projecting rotational limit stop (45, 60)
which abuts against a surface (58) of the female

bracket during rotation of the joint.
Joint prosthesis according to Claim 1, used for
a finger joint, either metacarpo-phalangeal or interphalangeal,

characterized in that it comprises crossed
grooves (61) on the diaphysial parts (57, 59) in order

to facilitate implantation of the prosthesis in the
bones.
