<ABSTRACT>
The quantitative characterisation of a liquid (dye) penetration analysis method consists in determining the detection sensitivity and the background noise generated by the analysis method, by processing images acquired from one or more control samples prepared according to this method and subjected to suitable and optimised illumination methods. The liquid penetration analysis method is optimised by finding out which are the influential parameters and by looking for the value of these parameters which makes it possible to maximise the detection sensitivity and minimise the background noise.

A process for automatically characterising, optimising
and monitoring a crack detection analysis method,,

characterised in that it consists of:

choosing at least one control specimen,
preparing the specimen according to the chosen analysis method
by using an indicator product for showing up surface defects;
exposing the specimen toappropriate lighting adapted to the
chosen indicator product,
obtaining at least one image of the control specimen,
processing the image to eliminate artifacts and quantitatively
determine the detection sensitivity and background noise

produced by the chosen analysis method, the detection
sensitivity being found from the dimensions and average

brightness of the surface defects displayed on the processed
image, and
searching for the influencing parameters and determining for
each such parameter a value which maximises detection

sensitivity and minimises background noise.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
image processing for determining detection sensitivity

consists for each image of:

correcting the image (311, 312) to obtain a homogeneous
background having a predetermined grey level, 
filtering the grey-level image (313) so as to combine
intermittent indications associated with a single fissure,
calculating a threshold value and binarising the image (314)
thereat in order to retain only those points of the image

likely to correspond to a defect in the article,
filtering the binary image (315) in order to eliminate image
points which are not associated with defects and which were

not eliminated by the filtering of the grey-level image,
searching for multiple indications (316) to detect close-together
defects which have merged,
separating out the indications (317) of defects which have
merged, and
extracting a sensitivity index (318).
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that the
detection sensitivity of the analysis method is equal to the

average value of the sensitivity indices extracted from each
of the obtained images.
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that the
image processing for determining background noise consists for

each obtained image of effecting a thresholding
(36) of the image which had the lowest threshold value

obtained for sensitivity determination before extracting a
background noise level (37).
A process according to claim 4, characterised in that the
background noise caused by the analysis method is equal to the

average value of the background noise levels obtained for each
of the obtained images. 
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that to
determine detection sensitivity the control specimen is a

standard block with fissures of known depth.
A process according to claim 5, characterised in that to
determine background noise the control specimen is an article

made of a material identical to the material of the articles
to be inspected and having a surface state representative of

the latter articles.
An apparatus for carrying out a process according to any
of claims 1 to 7 for automatically characterising, optimising

and controlling a fluorescent crack detection analysis method
wherein articles to be inspected have surface defects which

are made apparent by using an indicator product emitting
visible radiation in light centred around a wavelength

exciting the indicator product, comprising lighting means (10,
camera means (12) and image-processing means (13),

characterised in that the lighting means (10) comprise in
series a source (20) of ultraviolet light, a monochromator

(21) comprising at least one dispersion network for selecting
a bandwidth of a wavelength centred around the excitation

wavelength of the indicator product, and a light guide (23)
for focusing the ultraviolet radiation on a zone of the

article to be inspected.
An apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that
it also comprises two matching and focusing devices (20, 24)

disposed at the entry and exit respectively of the
monochromator.
An apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in that
it also comprises a heat filter (25) disposed upstream of the

monochromator (21). 
An apparatus according to any of claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that the monochromator is a double

monochromator comprising two mechanically interconnected
dispersion networks adjusted to select the same wavelength.
