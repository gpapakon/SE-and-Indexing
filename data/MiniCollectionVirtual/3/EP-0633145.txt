<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal recording sheet having a thermal recording layer 
containing a colorless or pale colored dye precursor and a color 

developer reactable with the dye precursor upon heating to develop 
a color, a dimerized or trimerized urea compound is used as the color 

developer to obtain a thermal recording sheet which is superior in 
ground color stability and a thermal recording sheet having a 

reversible recordability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal recording sheet with improved
stability of the ground color and to a thermal recording sheet having
a reversible recording ability with a bright color tone.In general, to obtain a thermal recording sheet, a colorless
or pale colored electron-donating dye and a color developer such as
phenolic compounds are individually pulverized to fine particles,
mixed with each other, and a binder, a filler, a sensitizer, a slip
agent, and other additives are added to obtain a coating color, which
is coated on a substrate such as paper, synthetic paper, films,
plastics, or the like. The coated sheet is color developed by an
instantaneous chemical reaction by heating with a thermal head, a hot
stamp, laser light, or the like to obtain a visible record.The thermal recording sheet is used in a wide variety of
applications such as measuring recorders, a terminal printer for
computers, facsimile, automatic ticket vendors, bar-code labels,
and the like. However, with recent diversification and advance in
recording apparatus for thermal recording sheet, the thermal recording
sheet is required to meet increased requirements. For example, with
increasing speed of recording, it is required to obtain a high-density
and sharp color image even with a smaller thermal energy, whereas, 
in view of storage stability of the recording sheet, it is required
to have improved light resistance, oil resistance, water resistance,
and solvent resistance.On the other hand, with increasing use of systems for recording
on plain paper such as electrophotographic and ink jet recording
systems, thermal recording becomes often compared with such plain
paper recording. For example, thermal recording is required to be
close in quality to plain paper recording in terms of stability of
recorded portion (image) and stability of unrecorded portion
(ground color portion) before and after recording (hereinafter
referred to as ground color stability). In particular, as a basic
function of thermal recording, the sheet is required to have a good
ground color stability to heat and solvents, that is, the sheet is
desired to be heat-sensitive only during recording, but non-sensitive
in other times.For the ground color stability of thermal recording sheet, for
example, JP-A-4-353490
discloses a thermal recording sheet which undergoes no deterioration
in the whiteness of ground color even at high temperatures of about
900Â°C. This thermal recording sheet contains 4-hydroxydiphenylsulfone
and a metal phosphate salt.Further, rapid
