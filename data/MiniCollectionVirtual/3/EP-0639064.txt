 MEDICAL INSTRUMENT WITH DUAL ACTION DRIVEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of medical instruments, and more particularly to the field o: medical instruments having end effectors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFor surgical or other procedures, medical tools having end effectors manually manipulated at the end of long extensions are frequently needed. The need particularly arises in arthoscopic and endoscopic surgery. For such procedures, medical devices, such as clamps, scissors and grippers exist in which the end effectors are located at the end of a long extension and are opened and closed by means of opposing handles located at the opposite end of the extension. Typically these devices are relatively small and are used in surgical procedures where a long narrow device provides access to tissue within the body with minimal disturbance of the adjacent tissue.Referring to Fig. 1, generally these devices 2 have an activation mechanism 4 (only partially depicted) which, attached to articulated arms 6, causes the end effectors to open and close. Also generally these articulated arms are joined together by press-fit pins 8. Pressure applied to close the end effectors may be high enough to shear the pins 8, which then can come free during the procedure, resulting serious complications to the patient.The present invention relates to a novel dual action drive member which does not apply pressure to close the end effectors of a medical device through pins which can come free and endanger the patient. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The dual action end effector medical instrument including a dual action drive member disclosed herein uses a dual action drive member to move the end effectors of the instrument, relative to one another, as the dual action drive member is moved proximally or distally within a tubular extension.In one embodiment, the medical instrument employs two movable end effectors each of which is rotatably attached, by means of a hollow pivot, located substantially adjacent to the proximal end of each end effector, to and within the tubular extension. Each end effector is also attached, between the outer surface of the end effector and the pivot, to a respective arm of the dual action drive member. As the dual action drive member is moved proximally or distally within the tubular extension, the distal ends of the end effectors are made to rotate about the pivot in a direction opposite to one another. The counter rotation of the distal ends of the end effectors opens and closes

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
1. A medical instrument comprising: a tubular extension having a distal end and a proximal 5 end; a first movable end effector pivotally attached by a pivot to said distal end of said tubular extension; a second movable end effector pivotally attached by said pivot to said distal end of said tubular extension; and 
â– 
>
0 a dual action drive member located within the tubular extension and capable of moving between a first proximal position and a second distal position within said tabular extension, said dual action drive member comprising a first arm in 15 communication with said first movable end effector and a
'
 second arm in communication with said second movable end ef ector, said first arm having a distal end surface for transferring force to said first end effector and said second 20 arm having a distal end surface for transferring force to said second end effector, wherein said dual action drive member is capable of moving in a proximal direction to cause said first movable end effector and said second movable end effector to rotate 25 about said pivot away from one another and is capable of moving in a distal direction so as to cause force to be transferred to said first movable end effector by said distal end surface of said first arm and to cause force to be transferred to said second movable end effector by said 30 distal end surface of said second arm thereby to cause said distal end of said second end effector and said distal end of said first end effector to move toward one another.
2. The medical instrument of claim 1 wherein each said end effector is a gripper. 


3. The medical instrument of claim l wherein each said end effector is a scissor blade.
4. The medical instrument of claim 1 wherein each said end effector is a clamp tine.
5. The medical instrument of claim 1 wherein said extension has a longitudinal axis and comprises a slot in its distal end so as to permit the distal end of said first end effector and the distal end of said second end effector to move in a direction perpendicular to said longitudinal axis of said extension.
6. The medical instrument of claim 1 wherein said first arm and said second arm are joined in a flexible wishbone junction.
7. The medical instrument of claim 1 wherein said pivot is hollow.
8. A medical instrument comprising: a tubular extension having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis; a handle portion attached adjacent to said proximal end of said tubular extension, said handle portion comprising an activation mechanism; a first movable end effector pivotally attached by a hollow pivot to said distal end of said tubular extension; a second movable end effector pivotally attached by said hollow pivot to said distal end of said tubular extension; and a dual action drive member locate within the tubular extension and connected to said activation mechanism, said dual action drive member comprising a first arm and a second arm, said first arm being attached to said first movable end effector and having a distal end surface for transferring 


force to said first end effector, and said second arm being attached to said second movable end effector and having a distal end surface for transferring force to said second end effector, said first arm and said second arm joined in a wishbone junction, wherein said activation member is capable of moving said dual action drive member between a first proximal position and a second distal position within said tabular extension, wherein said dual action drive member moving in a distal direction causes said distal end of said first movable end effector and said distal end of said second movable end effector to rotate about said pivot toward one another, wherein said dual action drive member moving in a proximal direction causes said distal end of said first movable end effector and said distal end of said second movable end effector to rotate about said pivot away from one another, and wherein said tubular extension comprises a slot in its distal end so as to permit the distal end of said first end effector and the distal end of said second end effector to move in a direction substantially perpendicular to said longitudinal axis of said extension.
9. A medical instrument comprising: a tubular extension having a longitudinal axis, a distal end and a proximal end; at least one movable end effector pivotally attached by a pivot to said distal end of said tubular extension; and a drive member located within the tubular extension and capable of moving between a first proximal position and a second distal position within said tabular extension, said drive member having at least one arm attached to said movable end effector, said arm having a distal end surface for transferring force to said movable end effector, wherein when said drive member is moved in said distal direction, force is transferred to said movable end effector 


causing said movable end effector to rotate about said pivot toward said longitudinal axis.
