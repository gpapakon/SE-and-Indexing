<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for providing a 
controlled gaseous environment at the opening to a 

receiver and around a free liquid stream downwardly 
entering the receiver opening. The method comprises 

laminarly emitting at least two gas flows to extend and 
intersect over the receiver opening thereby forming an 

upward plume enveloping the free liquid stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlling the
environment surrounding a free fluid stream entering a
receiver.Many organic and inorganic materials have adverse
reactions upon contact with gases. For example,
atmospheric oxygen may dissolve in hot metal, as when
molten metal is exposed to air. The oxygen may oxidize
some of the metal and degrade its properties. In
production processes, metal often must be poured from
one operating or holding container to another. In an
example of frequent practice, a quantity of metal is
melted in a furnace. The liquid metal is then poured
from the furnace into a receiver such as a crucible,
mold, ladle, or tundish. If the pouring is performed
in air, the liquid stream is susceptible to the
solution of, and oxidation by air.Several methods have been used to protect a molten
metal pouring stream. One method of protection is to
enclose both containers, such as the furnace and the
receiver, in an enclosure which is evacuated of air.
This, however, adds considerable capital cost and
cumbersomeness to the operation. All actions taken
with the enclosed furnace must be by remote control
through the wall of the enclosure. The enclosure also
interferes with visual observation of the liquid levels
in the furnace and receiver which may need to be
controlled for proper processing and safety. Operating
cost is high because of the power used to operate the
vacuum pump, and the inert gas commonly used to
backfill the enclosure to allow the molten metal to be
removed from the receiver.Another method is to pour the molten metal from 
the furnace to the receiver through a tube or shroud.
However this is inconvenient and does not provide
complete protection. Because the furnace is usually
tilted for pouring, a rigid tube or shroud of fixed
dimensions cannot be adjusted to the changing distance
from the furnace spout and the receiver opening.
Before pouring begins, the tube or shroud interior is
ordinarily occupied by air which comes into contact
with the liquid stream when pouring begins. In
addition, the tube or shroud interferes visual
observation of the liquid level through the receiver
opening.In another method, liquified inert gas, such as
liquid nitrogen, is introduced into the receiver so
that when liquid metal is poured into the receiver, the
liquified gas can float on the surface of the liquid
metal. The liquefied gas vaporizes into gas which
displaces air from the receiver volume and rises from
the receiver at least partially protecting the pouring
liquid stream ream from exposure to

A method for providing a controlled gaseous
environment at the opening (18) to a receiver (16) and around a

free liquid stream (14) downwardly entering the receiver
opening (18), said method comprising emitting

at least two gas flows to extend and intersect over
the receiver opening (18) thereby forming an upward plume

enveloping the free liquid stream(14),

characterized in that said at least two
gas flows are laminarly emitted at

a modified Froude number from about 0.2 to about 0.5. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein said gas
flows are emitted at a modified Froude number within

the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.45.

at its source is emitted with an original thickness (t) at

least 5% of the distance over which the flow extends
over the opening.

locating the origin (12) of the free stream not further from

the plane of the receiver opening (18) than approximately
five times the original thickness (t) of a flow.
The method as in claim 1 wherein the free
stream (14) enters the receiver opening (18) not further from the

intersection of said at least two gas flows than
approximately the original thickness (t) of one of the

flows.

(d) said at least one gas emitting
unit being a diffuser (20), each diffuser (20)

comprising an emitting area (22)
