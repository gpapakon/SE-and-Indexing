<ABSTRACT>
Simulated photographic prints are created using xerographic imaging. A 
transparent carrier (25) having a xerographically formed mirror image (67) fused thereto is 

bonded to a substrate (106) through the use of heat and pressure (114,116,118). The 
transparent carrier and the substrate form the finished print (122). The substrate (106) may be 

highly reflective, and made of, for example paper or plastic, or it may carry a reflective coating 
such as a white glue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to color imaging and more particularly to a method
and apparatus for producing simulated photographic prints using xerography.In the practice of conventional xerography, it is the general procedure to form
electrostatic latent images on a xerographic surface by first uniformly charging a charge
retentive surface such as a photoreceptor. The charged area is selectively dissipated in
accordance with a pattern of activating radiation corresponding to original images. The
selective dissipation of the charge leaves a latent charge pattern on the imaging surface
corresponding to the areas not exposed by radiation.This charge pattern is made visible by developing it with toner by passing the
photoreceptor past a single developer housing. The toner is generally a colored toner which
adheres to the charge pattern by electrostatic attraction. The developed image is then fixed to
the imaging surface or is transferred to a receiving substrate such as plain paper to which it is
fixed by suitable fusing techniques.Recently, there has been a great deal of effort directed to the development of color
copiers/printers which utilize the xerographic process. Such efforts have resulted in the recent
introduction of the Xerox 5775 copier/printer and the Fuji Xerox A-Color 635 copier/printer.The quality of color xerographic images on paper has approached the quality of color
photographic prints. However, color xerographic prints fall short because they do not have the
uniform gloss, the wide density range or the brilliance typical of photographic prints. Nor do
xerographic prints have the feel of photographic prints because the paper usually used is too
lightweight and too limp.Typically the surface of color toner images is irregular or rough or rather lumpy. The
behavior of incident white light vis-a-vis such color images is believed to be as follows:
   Some of the white light incident on the substrate carrying the color toner images
specularly reflects off the substrate;
   Some of the light goes down into the paper, scatters around and comes back out in
various directions, some through the toner and some not;
   Because the toner surface is rough or irregular some of the light incident thereon is
reflected off the toner in various directions.
   Some of the light incident on the irregular toner surfaces passes through the toner
into the paper and comes back out in various directions.White light becomes colored due to selective absorption as it passes through toner.
The light then goes down
