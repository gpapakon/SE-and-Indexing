<CLAIMS>
Use, for sticking wall or floor coverings, of an
adhesive composition having an open time of 15 to

90 minutes and not containing colophony and/or colophony
derivatives, this adhesive composition being in the form

of a water-in-oil emulsion and containing, as essential
constituents:


a) at least one aqueous dispersion of one or more
acrylic polymers or copolymers, having a glass

transition temperature of less than +5°C;
b) mineral fillers, the particle size of which is
between 0.05 and 500 µm, and/or at least one

thickener, and
c) at least one vegetable or mineral oil which is
liquid at room temperature.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
adhesive composition also contains an agent able to

disperse mineral fillers.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the adhesive composition also

contains an emulsifier.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of acrylic polymer or

copolymer, expressed as dry extract, represents at least
20% by weight of the dry matter of said composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of acrylic polymer or

copolymer, expressed as dry extract, represents at most
40% by weight of the dry matter of the composition. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of mineral fillers is

less than 60% by weight of the dry matter of said
composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of mineral fillers is

higher than 20% by weight of the dry matter of said
composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the content of thickener is

between 0.05 and 2% by weight of the dry matter of said
composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of mineral or vegetable

oil represents 2 to 10% by weight of the dry matter of
said composition.
Use according to any one of Claims 2 to 9, characterized
in that the amount of dispersing agent represents 0.05

to 0.5% and preferably 0.1 to 0.2% by weight of the dry
matter of the composition.
Use according to any one of Claims 3 to 10,
characterized in that the amount of emulsifier

represents at most 2% by weight of the dry matter of
said composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the thickener is chosen from

cellulose ethers and mixtures thereof.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the mineral fillers are calcium

carbonate. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the oil is linseed oil.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, in its ready-to-use form, it

contains 10 to 40% and preferably 20 to 30% by weight of
water.
