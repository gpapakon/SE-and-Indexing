<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bearing arrangement and 
parts suitable for said arrangement, such as a roller bearing, 

which is suitable for the absorption of shock loads. To that 
purpose those parts which come into contact with each other 

under shock loads or great loads are provided on one of the 
adjacent outer contact surfaces (16,16',17,17') facing each other with a 

friction-reducing 
coating. Such a coating may contain molybdenum 

or bronze and is suitably applied by means of a thermal 
spraying method, such as wire spraying. The bearing arrangements 

provided by the invention have a significantly longer 
operational life.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bearing arrangement 
which is suitable for the absorption of shock loads and 
is provided with parts rotating concentrically relative to 
each other, which parts, as group, comprise a roller bearing 
and further at least a second adjacent roller bearing and/or 
housing part, whereby the parts can come into contact with 
each other at the adjacent, facing contact surfaces. Such a bearing arrangement is known and is applied, 
for instance, in a steel-rolling mill. The bearing arrangements 
used therein often comprise different roller bearings 
rotating concentrically and at different speeds relative to 
each other. Apart from the radial forces that develop during 
rolling, shock loads develop in axial direction. When, due to 
an axial movement of the roller bearings, the contact surfaces 
of the roller bearings contact each other, the friction occurring 
during slip between the contact surfaces of the roller 
bearings suddenly causes a considerable rise in temperature, 
which very quickly falls again as the heat is dissipated to 
the roller bearings. The large and rapid fluctuations in temperature 
result in a so-called "white layer" on the contact 
surface. This white layer is characterized by different metallurgical 
properties to those of the bearing material, which is 
usually steel. With time microcracks appear at regular intervals 
in the contact surface, which in time will extend into 
the roller bearing. This problem is described in Die Wälzlager 
- W. Jürgensmeyer; Berlin, publishers Julius Springer, 1937. 
When microcracks have appeared in the contact surface, the 
roller bearing must be replaced in order to avoid damage to 
the bearing arrangement resulting in unplanned standstill of 
the rolling process. It is the object of the present invention to avoid 
the occurrence of large temperature fluctuations at the contact 
surfaces which is the cause of microcracks, and to provide 
a bearing arrangement with a longer operational life.  To that purpose the bearing arrangement according to 
the invention is characterized in that of at least two adjacent, 
facing contact surfaces one contact surface is coated 
with a friction-reducing layer. The friction-reducing layer lengthens the time during 
which slip between the contact surfaces of different roller 
bearings and/or housing parts occurs, while there is less heat 
generation per unit of time. It takes longer before the roller 
bearings have the same relative speed, allowing for the 
friction heat to be removed
