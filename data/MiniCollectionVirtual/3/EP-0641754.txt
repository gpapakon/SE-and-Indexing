<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multi-part compost silo which is made up of a plurality of preferably panel-like wall elements (2) which are provided with connecting flanges (4) on their abutting border regions and connected to one another by means of releasable connecting devices (3). In the case of said multi-part compost silo, it is proposed that the connecting devices (3) be designed as slit, single-piece and rigid clamping sleeves (6), that it be possible for each rigid clamping sleeve (6) to be positioned on the adjoining connecting flanges (4) of two wall elements (2), and that it be possible for each rigid clamping sleeve (6), by rotation about its longitudinal axis or displacement along its longitudinal axis, to be brought into positively locking engagement with two connecting flanges (4) and be firmly clamped on the two connecting flanges (4).

Multi-part compost silo comprising a plurality of
preferably plate-shaped wall elements which are provided at

their abutting edge areas with connecting flanges and connected
to one another by means of detachable connecting devices,

characterised in that the connecting devices (3) are formed as
slotted, one-piece, rigid clamping sleeves (6), in that each

rigid clamping sleeve (6) can be slid onto the abutting
connecting flanges (4) of two wall elements (2), and in that

each rigid clamping sleeve (6) can be brought into positive
interlocking engagement with both connecting flanges (4) by

rotating it about its longitudinal axis or displacing it along
its longitudinal axis and can be clamped firmly to both

connecting flanges (4).
Compost silo according to claim 1, characterised in that in
the abutting connecting flanges (4) of two wall elements (2)

through-openings are provided for the engagement with the rigid
clamping sleeves (6), the openings being formed as paired slots

(5) aligned with one another and running parallel to the edge
of the respective wall element (2), and in that the slotted,

rigid clamping sleeves (6) are formed as rotatable sleeves
which can be inserted into one of the aligned slots (5) and by

rotating them about their longitudinal axis into the other slot
(5).
Compost silo according to claim 1, characterised in that at
the abutting connecting flanges (4) of two wall elements (2)

edge beads (9) are provided for engagement with the rigid
clamping sleeves (6), the edge beads being formed as paired

edge beads (9) aligned with one another and running parallel to
the edge of the respective wall element (2), and in that the

slotted, rigid clamping sleeves (6) are formed as sliding
sleeves which by displacing them along their longitudinal axis

can be slid on to both edge beads (9). 
Compost silo according to claim 3, characterised in that,
at the abutting connecting flanges (4) of two wall elements

(2), pairs of edge beads (9) tapering in the same direction are
provided for engagement with the rigid sliding sleeves (6).
Compost silo according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the rigid clamping sleeves (6) have a

tapering longitudinal slot.
Compost silo according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that an outwardly projecting grip (7, 10) is

arranged on each rigid clamping sleeve (6).
Compost silo according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the rigid clamping sleeves (6) have an

essentially cylindrical cross-section.
Compost silo according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the rigid sleeves (6) have a helical

cross-section
Compost silo according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the rigid clamping sleeves (6) have a

wall thickness increasing in a wedge shape in their
circumferential and/or their longitudinal direction.
