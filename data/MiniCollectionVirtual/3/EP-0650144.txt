<ABSTRACT>
A method for displaying an image (200) on a display surface which preserves context 
and detail information when the image is compressed to fit onto a display surface. The image 

(200) is transformed from a plane onto a truncated pyramid (203), and then a three-dimensional 
perspective projection (Fig.4(b)) of the pyramid (203) is taken. This perspective 

provides a detailed view of portions of the image underlying an image lens panel (202), and 
context view of remaining portions of the image (200), which underlie side panels. The side 

panels are rotated and expanded to fill the remainder of the view after the detailed image 
under the image lens (202) is expanded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method of scaling an image and a context-preserving image
display apparatus according to the preamble parts of claims 1 and 7, respectively.Such a method and apparatus are described in EP-A-447 095. This document teaches to
present information on a sequence of images comprising a middle section and two peripheral
sections, left and right of the middle section. Each peripheral section appears to extend away from
the user at an angle from the edge of the middle section so that the peripheral sections occupy
relatively little of the screen.For the purposes of this application, several variations on an image will be defined. An
image is a visual display of information, or a logical representation of what is to become a visual
display of information. An image could be, but is not limited to, a text document, a map, or a graph.
The underlying information contained in an image depends on its form. For example, information in a
text document includes the information content of its words, the information content of the positions of
the words within the document, and the information content of text formatting and fonts, etc.
Information has many aspects, but two aspects are of particular concern here: detail and context.
Detail information in a text document image indicates which local information such as which fonts are
used and which characters are present in a local area of the image, while detail information in a map
indicates the symbols used on the map and the path taken by a road (in the case of road maps).
Context information, on the other hand, places these details in perspective with the other information
of the total image.An image standing alone, by definition, contains all the information content of that image.
When an image contains too much information to be displayed all at once on a given display device,
a substitute image comprising less than all the information content of the "full" image must be
accepted. The term "full image" will be used herein to refer to an original image, before any
information-losing operations are applied to the image to form a displayable substitute image. Of
course, such a substitute image could just as well be a full image for a yet lower resolution display,
however for simplicity, full images will be assumed to be ideal in that they contain all the information
necessary to display the full image on an ideal display (i.e., infinite resolution, size, color, etc.).When the full image is undisplayable in its entirety, the displayable image

<CLAIMS>
A method of displaying an image on a display surface (104), comprising the
steps of:

describing the image by a set of objects (400) located within an image
bounding rectangle (500) on a base plane;
characterized by the steps of:
locating (301) a lens panel (510; 402) within said image bounding rectangle
(500), where the sides of said lens panel are parallel to corresponding sides

of said image bounding rectangle;
dividing (302) said image bounding rectangle into said lens panel (510; 402),
and four side panels (502, 504, 506, 508), each side panel being the portion

of said image bounding rectangle (500) between an edge of said image
bounding rectangle and the parallel edge of said lens panel facing said edge

of said image bounding rectangle and lines drawn to corners of said edges of
said image bounding rectangle and said image lens, whereby each of said

side panels form a trapezoid,
defining a linear magnification of said lens panel (510; 402) from an original
size to a new size;
defining side transformations of said side panels from original trapezoids to
new trapezoids defined by redrawing said lines drawn to corners to be drawn

to corners of the magnified lens panel (E'F'G'H') as well as stretching and 
compressing the inner of the original trapezoids so that said new trapezoids
appear as projections of said original trapezoids on the sides of a truncated

pyramid whose top surface is formed by said magnified lens panel; and
rendering (303) the set of objects (400) through said side transformations and
said magnification onto said display surface (104).
The method of claim 1, wherein the objects are text characters, lines of
characters, and pages of lines, and the image is a document, or the objects

are nodes and lines, and the image is a map.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said step of rendering is different for said
lens panel and said side panels, said step of rendering for a side panel being

of a lower resolution than a rendering for said lens panel (Fig. 8).
The method of claim 3, wherein the image is a text document and said lower
resolution is provided by using a greeked font for text in said plurality of side

panels.
The method of one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the image is displayed on said
display surface (104), preserving context information by said side panels

(502, 504, 506, 508) and detail information by said lens panel (510; 402),
even when the image contains too much detail to be displayed all at once on

said display surface (104), further comprising the steps of:

storing a data block representing said objects wherein a full image is an
image generated from said data block before magnification or transformation

of any panel;
determining layout of said full image in two dimensions which is to be
displayed on the display surface (104) and includes context information; 
mapping said lens panel (510, 402) and said side panels (502, 504, 506, 508)
onto a truncated pyramid in a 3D space, said side panels forming wall

surfaces of said truncated pyramid; and
transforming said truncated pyramid through a perspective transform to form a
3D transformed layout, where a viewpoint for said perspective transform is

above said lens panel.
The method of claim 5 wherein said step of mapping onto said truncated
pyramid comprises the steps of:


determining a magnification factor of image portions under said lens panel
relative to bounds of said full image;
setting a height of said truncated pyramid such that a ratio of a distance from
said viewpoint to a base of said truncated pyramid and a distance from said

viewpoint to said top surface of said truncated pyramid is equal to said
magnification factor; and
rotating and expanding said plurality of side panels to fit said walls of said
truncated pyramid.
A context-preserving image display apparatus comprising a display surface
(104) which displays an image, comprising:


image input means (132) for accepting a pixel array representing the image;
panelling means, coupled to said image input means, for mapping pixels in
said pixel array to panels in a set of panels, the set of panels comprising a

lens panel (510, 402) and side panels (502, 504, 506, 508);

means pixels assigned to each panel of said set of panels, for transforming 

said pixels according to a transform function for each panel to which said
pixels are assigned, wherein said transform function for said lens panel is a

linear magnification, said transform functions forming a display pixel array;
and
a display driver, coupled for receiving said display pixel array from said
transformation means, where said display driver provides said display pixel

array to the display surface (104), to allow the display surface (104) to
illuminate pixels according to values in said display pixel array
characterized in that
said set of panels comprises four side panels (502, 504, 506, 508), each side
panel being a portion of said image between an edge of said image and an

edge of said lens panel (510, 402) facing said edge of said image and lines
drawn to corners of said edges of said image and said lens panel and
