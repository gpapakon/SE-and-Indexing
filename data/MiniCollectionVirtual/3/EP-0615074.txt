<ABSTRACT>
The lining (1) consists of blocks (2) mounted on a support (3), each being solidly attached to the support by an assembly element (5), and is characterised in that:   a) the said assembly element (5) consists of a base (9) with a rim (13) having no axial symmetry, b) the said support (3) consists of two metal plates, a rigid support plate (7) and an assembly plate (6) comprising orifices (10) so as to be capable of clamping the said rim (13) by virtue of means (8) for mechanical linkage between these two plates (6, 7), c) at least one of the said plates (6, 7) has a deformation so as to grip the said rim and thus obtain rotational immobilisation of the block (2).

A brake lining (1) constituted by friction studs (2) mounted on a support (3) and 
forming a friction surface (19), each of said friction studs (2) comprising a friction 

block (4) of which the cross-section is constant over its entire height, rigid with an 
assembly element for mounting said stud on said support, said support comprising a 

rigid metal plate (7) provided with a fixing lug (12) and a mounting plate (6) 
comprising orifices (10), and characterised in that 


a) said assembly element consists of a base (9) of said friction block (4) having a flange 
(13) with no axial symmetry and outside the perpendicular projection of said block (4) 

on said support (3), 
b) said flange (13) gripped between all or part of a ring (11) on said assembly plate (6) 
defining each said orifice (10) and said rigid mounting plate (7), thanks to mechanical 

connecting means (8) between these two plates (6,7) comprising the cooperation of 
male elements (21) on one plate with corresponding female elements (22) on the other 

plate, each said orifice (10) having a cross-section close to that of said block (4), 
c) at least one of said plates (6,7) has a localised deformation (close to said orifices) of 
depth E, cooperating with all or part of said flange (13) of thickness E' (E' 
>
 E), in 
such a way as to grip said flange and so achieve rotary locking of said friction stud (2). 
A lining according to Claim 1 wherein said mounting plate (6) displays said localised 
deformation. 
A lining according to Claim 2 wherein said flange (13) is discontinuous and comprises 
at least an alternating arrangement of an annular relief portion (14) and an annular 

hollow portion (15), wherein said ring (11) comprises, according to the same said 
alternating pattern, parts which are deformed in relief (16) and plane parts (17), 

wherein each said hollow annular portion (15) meshes in each said plane part (17) in 
order to produce a rotational locking of said stud and wherein each said annular relief 

portion (14) is gripped between each deformed part (16) of said ring (11) and said rigid 
support plate (7) in order to assemble said stud (2) and said support (3). 
A lining according to Claim 2 wherein said flange (130) forms a continuous relief, 
wherein said ring (11), with no axial symmetry, has a part (160) deformed in relief and  

 
adapted to match said flange (130), and wherein said flange (130) is gripped between 

said ring (11) and said rigid support plate (7) in order to ensure simultaneously 
rotational locking of said stud (2) and its assembly together with said support (3). 
A lining according to Claim 1 wherein said rigid support plate (7) has said localised 
deformation. 
A lining according to Claim 1 wherein said mounting plate (6) and said rigid support 
plate (7) display said localised deformation. 
A lining according to any one of Claims 1 to 6 wherein, in order to be able effectively 
to grip said flange (13,130), the distance between plates (6) and (7), outside of the 

localised deformation, is less than 0.5 x E'. 
A lining according to any one of Claims 1 to 7 wherein said mechanical means (8) of 
connecting the assembly and support plates comprise small metal sleeves (21) obtained 

by deformation (deep drawing, snarling) of one of the mounting or support plates, at 
the flared end after passing through the fixing orifices (22) of the other of the assembly 

or support plates, so as to obtain a riveting effect bringing the plates in tension the one 
in relation to the other. 
A lining according to Claim 8 wherein said mechanical connecting means (8) are 
distributed over the assembly of said support (3) in such a way that each friction stud 

(2) is substantially surrounded by preferably at least three said mechanical connecting 
means. 
A lining according to Claim 9 wherein said mechanical connecting means (8) comprise 
welding points (23) on the periphery of said lining. 
A lining according to any one of Claims 1 to 10 wherein the material constituting said 
plates (6,7) is chosen from among the metal alloys, preferably steel. 
A lining according to Claim 11 wherein the material of at least one of said plates is 
preferably a steel with a high elastic limit.  

 
A lining according to any one of Claims 1 to 12 wherein said friction stud comprises a 
friction block of sintered material (metallic powders, ceramic powders) or carbon.
