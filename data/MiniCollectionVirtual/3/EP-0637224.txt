<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to bioprosthetic
vascular implants and, more particularly, to stents and
support/guide assemblies which are operative to (a) provide
support for, (b) facilitate the implantation of, and (c)
minimize thromboembolic complications resulting from
artificial or bioprosthetic vascular implants.Modern vascular surgical procedures often involve the
grafting of a tubular prosthetic implant of artificial or
natural origin into an existing blood vessel for the
purpose of replacing or bypassing a segment of diseased or
damaged blood vessel. Many such procedures are
accomplished by surgically removing the diseased or damaged
segment of blood vessel, and subsequently replacing the
removed segment of vessel with an appropriately sized
tubular implant graft. The implant graft is typically held
in place by anastomosing the ends of the implant graft to
the opposing ends of the resected blood vessel.In individuals who suffer from chronic venous valvular
insufficiency, vascular grafting procedure have utilized to
transplant functioning venous valves into the affected
veins of the lower extremities. The transplantation of
functioning venous valves in such individuals is
therapeutically important as chronic incompetence or
absence of venous valves into the veins of the lower
extremities is known to give rise to numerous pathological
consequences. For example, incompetence or absence of 
venous valves at the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal
junctions may result in noncosmetic varices of the primary
and/or secondary veins of the lower leg and ankle.
Additionally, deep venous hypertension of the lower limb
may occur. Such venous hypertension may result in
lymphedema, aberrant pigmentation of the skin and, in
severe cases, the formation of necrotizing lesions known as
"venous ulcers".Surgical transplantation of one or more functioning
venous valves into a valve-deficient vein is a viable means
of restoring venous valvular function to the valve
deficient vein. The routine use of venous valve
"transplant" procedures has heretofore been largely limited
to autograft procedures. Such autograft procedures require
the initial surgical excision of an autologous segment of
viable vein (i.e. vein having a functioning venous valve
therein) from one site within the patient's body, followed
by subsequent transplantation of the harvested autograft to
other veins wherein the venous valvular insufficiency has
occurred. Such autograft transplant procedures are
problematic because of (a) difficulties
