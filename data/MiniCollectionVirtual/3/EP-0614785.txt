<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle passenger restraint air bag (10) exhibits 
controlled deployment of a vertically elongated frontal 

surface (40) prior to full inflation. The air bag (10) 
includes a depending lobe (52) extending downwardly from an 

inlet opening (26) secured to an inflator module (30) 
mounted in a dashboard (32). A portion of the front panel 

(40) of the air bag (10) is releasably secured, by 
breakaway stitching (42), to a portion of the rear of the 

depending lobe (52), below the inlet opening (26). Outward 
deployment of the air bag (10) in an elongated column is 

prevented by the stitching, and a broad front surface (40) 
develops early in the deployment and inflation process. 

The breakaway stitching (42) releases part way through the 
deployment and inflat
ion process, and the front surface 
(40) then fills out to full inflation. Stitching (42) may 

have a higher density in an area of initial release, be 
disposed in lines which diverge towards the inlet opening 

or be disposed in spaced apart portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein refers to a vehicle air bag and 
more particularly to a passenger's side vehicle air bag adapted 
to deploy in a controlled manner. Many modern vehicles incorporate one or more inflatable 
air bags for the protection of occupants in the event of a crash. 
The air bags are mounted in a folded, compact condition in 
conjunction with a gas generator, and upon sensing of a vehicle 
crash, the gas generator produces inflation gas which rapidly 
deploys and inflates the air bag. The passenger side air bag is typically mounted in the 
dashboard and deploys toward the passenger as the passenger 
experiences relative motion toward the windshield, dashboard and 
deploying air bag. The thrust or main axis of deployment of the 
air bag is directly toward the passenger, and the material of the 
air bag initially forms an elongated column, the end of which may 
strike the driver, sometimes in the face, occasionally resulting 
in abrasions. Additionally, if the passenger's head is 
decelerated by the air bag while the passenger's torso is moving 
forward, the passenger can experience a whip lash motion. A 
further consideration is for small passengers and children who, 
if they do not impede against the air bag as it initially 
deploys, may slip under it and be less than fully protected. The foregoing difficulties are exacerbated in vehicles 
mounting the air bag on an upwardly angled dashboard surface, 
whereby initial deployment is more upward than outward toward the 
passenger's torso.  
 U.S. Patent 5022675 discloses a vehicle air bag in 
which elongate fabric tethers are provided for modifying 
the final inflated shape of the air bag. The tethers are 
only tensioned, and thereby effect the shape of the air 
bag, when the air bag has been substantially completely 
inflated. German Patent 2944319, on which the pre-characterising 
portion of claim 1 is based, discloses a 
vehicle air bag in which a lateral row of break-away 
stitching extends completely across the air bag so as to 
prevent inflating gas from entering a lower portion of the 
air bag during an initial stage of inflation. European 
patent 0 495 409 discloses a similar arrangement in which 
break-away stitching is provided in two vertically disposed 
rows.  
 Accordingly, one design objective for passenger side 
air bags is to limit the extent of outward deployment prior to 
full inflation and to encourage a vertically elongated frontal 
surface in early deployment of the passenger side air bag. It is known in the prior art to

A vehicle occupant restraint system for mounting 
in a vehicle dashboard in front of a passenger position, 

the restraint system comprising: 

a) an air bag (10) defining an inlet opening (26) 
and which, when inflated, provides a vertically elongated 

front surface (40); 
b) the air bag, when inflated, including a 
depending lobe (52) extending downwardly with respect to 

the vehicle dashboard (32), a front surface of the 
depending lobe (52) forming a portion (38) of the vertically 

elongated front surface of the air bag, and a rear 
surface of the depending lobe (52) extending from the inlet 

opening (26) to a bottom of the depending lobe (52); 
c) means (42) releasably connecting and securing an 
inside of a portion (38) of the air bag defining the 

vertically elongated front surface (40) to the inside of a 
portion (39) of the air bag (10) defining the rear surface 

of the depending lobe (52); and 
(d) means (30) connected to the air bag at the 
inlet opening (26), for providing inflation gas; 

characterised in that: 
 
   the releasable securing means (42) permit inflation 

gas to flow to the depending lobe (52) prior to release of 
the releasable securing means (42) whereby the releasable 

securing means (42) limits outward deployment of the 
vertically elongated front surface (40) of the air bag 

during initial inflation of the air bag and releases upon  
 

partial deployment and inflation of the air bag.
