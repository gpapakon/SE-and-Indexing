<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus, which is also suitable, in particular, for generating shock waves for acoustic irradiation (ultrasonic inspection) of objects inside a body, is equipped with piezoceramic transducer elements (1) as electroacoustic transducers which can be driven from a high-voltage source (9) by means of high-voltage pulses in order to generate shock waves or sound pulses by means of directional deformations and changes in length of the transducer elements (1) as a function of the prescribed polarisation of the transducer elements (1) and of the polarity of the high-voltage pulses. The acoustic energy emitted by the apparatus is particularly high when a bias (14) is applied to the transducer elements (1) before the arrival of a high-voltage pulse (16), and are biased with a polarity opposite to the polarity of the high-voltage pulse.

Apparatus for producing sound pulses for the medical field of application, 
particularly for producing shock waves for ultrasonic therapy of intracorporal 

objects, having piezoceramic transducer elements (1) as electroacoustic 
transducers, which can be driven from a high-voltage source (9) using high-voltage 

pulses (16, 22, 25), in order to produce the sound pulses by means of directional 
length changes of transducer elements (1) as a function of the preset polarisation 

of transducer elements (1) and the polarity of the high-voltage pulses, 
characterised in that transducer elements (1) can be exposed to a bias voltage (14, 

19, 21, 24), the polarity of which is opposed to the polarity of the high-voltage 
pulse, before the arrival of a high-voltage pulse (16, 22, 25). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the bias voltage (14, 21) 
is a permanent direct voltage onto which the high-voltage pulses (16, 22) which 

are higher as regards their absolute voltage value are superimposed. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the bias voltage (19, 24) 
has a pulse wave shape and in each case can be switched off essentially 

isochronously with the start or with the arrival of a high-voltage pulse (16, 25). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, in which transducer elements (1) behave like 
RC members having a time constant 
τ ≈ R x C
, characterised in that the temporal 
length Δt of the bias voltage pulse (19, 24) and the time constant τ fulfil the 

relationship 
Δt ≧ 5τ
. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that in addition to 
the first high-voltage source (9) mentioned, a second high-voltage source (6) is 

provided to produce the bias voltage (14, 19, 21, 24), and in that the first high-voltage 
source (9) can be connected to transducer elements (1) via a 

triggerable switch (12).
