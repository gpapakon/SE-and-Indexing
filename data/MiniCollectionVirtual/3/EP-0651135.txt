<ABSTRACT>
A device for joining two members together such as concrete 
segments (1, 2) for a tunnel lining ring includes a first 

sleeve (3) for fitting in one of the members to open at a 
surface thereof and a second sleeve (7) for fitting in the 

other member. A connecting pin (11) with external ribbing 
fits in both sleeves, which have internal ribbing, the ribbing 

of the connecting pin and/or the ribbing of at least one of 
said sleeves being of resilient material and extending in a 

substantially parallel direction at an inclined angle to a 
longitudinal axis of the connecting pin when it is, in use, 

inserted in the sleeves. The bore of one sleeve is of greater 
cross-sectional area in one dimension than the bore in the 

other sleeve, in which other bore the connecting pin can 
engage as a tight fit, whilst being able to engage in the 

firstmentioned bore and traverse it in said one dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for joining two members
together.The members can be concrete segments to form, for example, a
tunnel lining ring.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a device for joining two members together, the device
comprising a first sleeve for fitting in one of said members
to open at a surface thereof, a second sleeve for fitting in
the other of said members to open at a surface of said other
member, and a connecting pin arranged to fit in both sleeves,
said sleeves each having a bore with internal ribbing and said
connecting pin having external ribbing and the ribbing of said
connecting pin and/or the ribbing of the bore of at least one
of said sleeves being of resilient material, characterised in
that the ribbing of said connecting pin and/or of said at
least one of said sleeves comprises ribs which extend substantially parallel
to one another at an inclined angle to the longitudinal axis of said
connecting pin when the pin is, in use, inserted in the bores,
and that the bore of said at least one sleeve is of greater
cross-sectional area in one dimension than the other bore, in
which other bore said connecting pin can engage as a tight
fit, whilst being able to engage in said bore of said at least
one sleeve and traverse it in said one dimension.According to another aspect of the present invention there is
provided a concrete segment joining system comprising two
segment members and a device essentially as just defined for
joining the two segment members together. Each member can be a segment of a circle so that a plurality
of segments can be joined together to form a circle. The
segments can be made of concrete and can be utilised to form
a tunnel lining.Preferably, the bores in the sleeves are rectangular in cross-section,
said bore of said at least one sleeve having an
elongated cross-section compared with said other bore.Preferably, the sleeves themselves are of substantially
rectangular cross-section with one of the sleeves being of
elongate cross-section compared with the other. In such a
case, the member receiving the sleeve with the elongate cross-section
is provided with a receiving aperture of similar
cross-section. The other member is similarly provided with a
receiving aperture of lesser cross-section to receive the
other sleeve.The ribbing of the connecting pin can be in the form of
threads, for example buttress threads. Alternatively, the
ribbing can be in the form of concentric circles. The ribbing
can be fully formed on the

A device for joining two members (1, 2) together, the
device comprising a first sleeve (3) for fitting in one of

said members (1) to open at a surface thereof, a second sleeve
(7) for fitting in the other of said members (2) to open at a

surface of said other member, and a connecting pin (11)
arranged to fit in both sleeves, said sleeves each having a

bore (4, 8) with internal ribbing (5, 9) and said connecting
pin having external ribbing (12) and the ribbing of said

connecting pin and/or the ribbing of the bore of at least one
of said sleeves being of resilient material, characterised in

that the ribbing of said connecting pin and/or of said at
least one of said sleeves comprises ribs which extend substantially parallel

to one another at an inclined angle to the longitudinal axis of said
connecting pin (11) when the pin is, in use, inserted in the

bores (4, 8), and that the bore (4) of said at least one sleeve (3)
is of greater cross-sectional area in one dimension than

the other bore (8), in which other bore said connecting pin
(11) can engage as a tight fit, whilst being able to engage in

said bore (4) of said at least one sleeve (3) and traverse it
in said one dimension.
A device according to claim 1, wherein said bores (4, 8)
in said sleeves are rectangular in cross-section, said bore

(4) of said at least one sleeve (3) having an elongated cross
section compared with said other bore (8).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ribbing
of said connecting pin (11) is in the form of threads.
A device according to claim 3, wherein said threads are
buttress threads. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ribbing
of said connecting pin (11) is in the form of concentric

circles.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein both the connecting pin (11) and the bores of both

sleeves (3, 7) are ribbed.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the ribbing of said one sleeve (3) is only partially

formed at the entry end for said connecting pin (11) to
provide a looser fit there than at the end of said first

sleeve (3) where said connecting pin engages as a tight fit.
A concrete segment joining system comprising two segment
members (1, 2) and a device according to any one of the

preceding claims for joining the two segment members together.
A system according to claim 8, wherein each segment
member (1, 2) is made of concrete for forming a tunnel lining.
A system according to claim 8 or 9, wherein each segment
is provided with respective apertures (6, 10) for receiving

the respective sleeves (3, 7) of the device.
