Tin compound-containing compositions as one of 
the two components of two-component systems which cross-link 

at room temperature to give organopolysiloxane 
elastomers, the compositions containing, as essential 

constituents 

(a) a diorganopolysiloxane which contains triorganosiloxy 
groups as terminal units and in which the 

organic radicals are hydrocarbon radicals, which may 
be halogenated, 
(b) a product of the reaction of a bis-silyl-alkane 
containing at least two monovalent hydrocarbon 

radicals per molecule which are bonded to silicon 
via oxygen and are optionally substituted by an 

alkoxy group, or an oligomer thereof, with a 
diorganotin diacylate, 
(c) an organosilicon compound containing at least one 
amino or imino group per molecule which is bonded to 

silicon via carbon, if desired 
(d) a filler and if desired 
(e) a bis-silyl-alkane and/or silane containing at least 
three monovalent hydrocarbon radicals per molecule 

which are bonded to silicon via oxygen and are 
optionally substituted by an alkoxy group or an 

oligomer thereof, with the proviso that if, in 
preparing reaction product (b), use is made of bis-silyl-alkane 

containing only two monovalent hydrocarbon 
radicals per molecule which are bonded to 

silicon via oxygen and are optionally substituted by 
an alkoxy group or of not more than 8 gram equivalent 

of monovalent hydrocarbon radicals which are 
bonded to silicon via oxygen and are optionally 

substituted by an alkoxy group per gram of  
 

diorganotin diacylate, then the compositions 
according to the invention must also contain (e) 

bis-silyl-alkane and/or silane containing at least 
three monovalent hydrocarbon radicals per molecule 

which are bonded to silicon via oxygen and are 
optionally substituted by an alkoxy group, or an 

oligomer thereof. 
Compositions according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the SiOC-bonded organic radicals in the 

constituents (b), (c) and (e) are identical.
