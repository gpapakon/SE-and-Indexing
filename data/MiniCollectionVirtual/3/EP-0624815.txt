<ABSTRACT>
A process for the formation of a cel for use in 
color animation motion picture production comprises the 

steps of providing electronic information of a color 
image to a thermal printer, thermally printing a first 

image having at least some opaque areas therein onto a 
transparent carrier sheet from said electronic 

information, and optically combining said first image 
with a second image on a separate transparent sheet, 

the composite of the first and second image forming a 
cel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to animated film
production, cel creation for use in the production of
animated film, and thermal transfer imaging systems,
techniques, and media useful in the production of
animated films.The visual quality of an animated film is readily
observable as a function of the quality and detail of
the individual motion picture frames. The individual
frames in the film are photographic images taken of
individual pictures for each individual frame. These
individual pictures are called "cels". In the highest
quality cels, the background area is drawn, usually by
hand, and hand painted overlays of the active
characters are placed over the background areas and the
composite scene photographed. The active character
figures are progressively different (and individually
painted that way) for each cel. This is an exceedingly
expensive procedure when the highest quality images are
desired.In lower quality animated films, such as those
often produced expressly for low budget television
shows, expenses are reduced by reducing the degree of
activity of the characters. With lower levels of
activity, the background area can encompass greater
proportions of the active character, with less of the
character having to be drawn to show its movement. For 
example, the background could include the normal scenic
background and all of the character except for its
mouth. The only overlay for the cel would have to be
the moving lower jaw of the character to show that it
was speaking.Modern animated films can now use computer driven
imaging systems to create the cels. The cells may be
hand drawn and scanned, drawn on a digital screen and
converted to digital information for the computer, and
data may be created, enhanced, or altered by computer
programs. Various programs are available where the
computer can create the data of intermediate images
between two scenes by a process call 'morphization,'
where given a beginning position and an end position
for a figure, the computer will generate the
intermediate frames without the need for hand drawing.
Any system which is capable of being data driven by a
computer may be used as the image output system to
produce the various cels, but color negative
photographic imaging provides the highest quality
images for the motion picture industry. This is still
an expensive procedure and does not provide a wide
range of flexibility in the manufacture of the cels.There are also specific properties in the image of
the cel which limit the types of imaging systems which
could

<CLAIMS>
A process for the formation of a cel for use
in color animation motion picture production comprising

the steps of providing electronic information of a
color image to a thermal printer, thermally printing a

first image having at least some opaque areas therein
onto a transparent carrier sheet from said electronic

information, and optically combining said first image
with a second image on a separate transparent sheet,

the composite of the first and second image forming a
cel.
The process of claim 1 wherein said second
image is formed by thermal transfer imaging from

electronic information representing the second image.
The process of claims 1 or 2 wherein said
thermal transfer process comprises thermal mass

transfer of a dye and/or pigment in a binder resin.
The process of claim 1 wherein a border
between colors in the image is deposited by a thermal

transfer process.
The process of claim 3 wherein a black border
between colors in at least one of the images is

deposited by a thermal transfer process.
The process of claim 1 wherein said first
image is an overlay image and said second image is a

background image for a cel.
The process of claim 1 wherein said opaque
area is has a color or tone selected from the group

consisting of white, bone, ivory, gray, black, or
metallic. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said opaque
area has a color or tone selected from the group

consisting of red, magenta, yellow, cyan, blue or
green.
The process of claims 7 or 8 wherein said
opaque areas have a transmission optical density of

more than 0.05.
