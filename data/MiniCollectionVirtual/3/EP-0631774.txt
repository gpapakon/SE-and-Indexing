a skin care action and/or pharmaceutical activity. 
Emulsion according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that it comprises, as substances having a skin care 

action and/or pharmaceutical activity, those from the 
group consisting of urea, sodium lactate, sodium 

pyrrolidonecarboxylate, dihydroxyacetone and panthenol. 
Emulsion according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the oily phase O comprises oils and/or fats having 

skin care properties or consists of these.
