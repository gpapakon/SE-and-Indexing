<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive
resin composition for forming barrier ribs for an EL display
element, barrier rib and EL display element. More
specifically, it relates to a radiation sensitive resin
composition suitable for use as a material for forming barrier
ribs for an EL display element, a barrier rib formed therefrom
and an EL display element comprising the same.Generally speaking, the micro-patterning of the
cathode and organic EL medium layer of an organic EL element
is difficult because the heat resistance (generally 100°C
or lower), solvent resistance and moisture resistance of an
organic EL medium used in a charge injection layer and light
emitting layer are low. For example, when photolithography
generally used for the patterning of a thin film is used for
an organic EL element, deterioration in the characteristic
properties of the organic EL element are caused by the
permeation of a solvent contained in a photoresist into the
organic EL element, high-temperature atmosphere during the
baking of the photoresist, the permeation of a photoresist
developer or etching solution into the organic EL element,
or the damage of the organic EL element by plasma during dry
etching.Patterning may be carried out using a deposition mask.
However, a fine pattern cannot be formed due to such problems
that a short circuit occurs between an anode and a cathode
made from indium tin oxide (to be abbreviated as ITO
hereinafter) by the entry of a deposited product between a 
substrate and a mask caused by poor adhesion between the
substrate and the deposition mask or the organic EL medium
layer scratched by its contact with the mask when the
substrate and deposition mask are forcedly brought into close
contact with each other and that the mask bends due to its
insufficient strength when the openings of a striped pattern
for the cathode are large and the mask portion is a fine
pattern.To solve the above problems, for example, JP-A 2-66873
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published
Japanese patent application") discloses a method for
patterning a photoresist comprising a solvent which does not
dissolve an organic EL medium on the organic EL element and
etching a cathode using dilute sulfuric acid. However, the
organic EL medium is damaged by diluted sulfuric acid during
etching.JP-A 5-275172, JP-A 5-258859 and JP-A 5-258860 disclose
a patterning method in which having a sectional shape of
normally tapered barrier ribs and having a height of several
to several tens of
