<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a hollow fiber separation assembly having 
one or more bundles of hollow fiber membranes with a tubesheet at each 

end enclosed by an end cap. An impermeable housing, preferably made 
from a flexible polymeric material, most preferably a shrinkable tubing, 

contacts and encloses the bundle, extending between the end caps. The 
polymeric, impermeable housing contacts and compacts the array of fibers in 

the bundle to enhance axial flow along the outside of individual fibers, 
protects the fiber bundle between the end caps, and contains the permeated 

fluid and diverts it to a port or ports at the end(s) of the bundle. This hollow 
fiber separation device provides a large capacity, and is also low cost, 

lightweight, may be used as a stand-alone separation device, and does not 

have a high-pressure section which requires testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for separating fluid mixtures or
solutions by selective permeation. More particularly, the invention is
directed to a housing for an apparatus for separating fluid mixtures,
especially gas mixtures, by contact with selectively permeable hollow fiber
membranes, and a process for integrating the housing into the fluid
separation apparatus.Membrane devices are used to selectively separate at least one fluid
component from a mixture of fluids. Membrane devices are used in a wide
variety of separation applications including reverse osmosis and gas
separation. Particular gas separations of interest include the recovery of an
enriched oxygen stream from air for use in enhanced combustion processes.
Alternately, an enriched nitrogen stream may be obtained from air for use as
an inert atmosphere over flammable fluids or for food storage. In other
embodiments, nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide or other organic
or inorganic gases may be separated from hydrocarbons.Different membrane device configurations suitable for fluid
separations are described in the art, including plate and frame, tubular,
spiral wound, and hollow fiber configurations. The hollow fiber
configuration is generally preferred because a higher surface area per unit
volume of device can be obtained, resulting in increased device productivity
compared to other configurations.It is known to utilize a bundle of hollow fiber membranes in which
the fibers are substantially parallel and the bundles are positioned in a
vessel, shell or housing for separating one fluid from a mixture of fluids by
allowing the one fluid to permeate from the mixture through the walls of the
hollow fiber membranes to the bores thereof, or vice versa. The hollow
fiber membranes are normally made from a polymeric material. The
housing is typically cylindrical. Hollow fiber membrane separation devices are typically fabricated by
parallel or bias wrapping a plurality of hollow fibers about a core. The
hollow fibers are embedded in at least one tubesheet and the assembly is
inserted into the housing. The tubesheet(s) sealingly engages along the
inside surface of the housing so that two fluid regions are defined, commonly
referred to as the shellside and the tubeside regions. The shellside region
lies on the outside of the hollow fibers and is defined by the inside wall of
the housing and the tubesheets which sealingly engage along the inside wall
of the housing. The tubeside region lies on the inside of the hollow fibers
and the
