<ABSTRACT>
The combination of a set (1) of containers (2) and of a bar (13) of caps (14), connected together by linking means (15), in an arrangement similar to that of the containers, permits positioning of the bar (13) of caps over the necks (5) of the containers in the set by means of a translational movement parallel to the axes of the containers. Clipping means (7) are provided on the necks (5) of the containers in order to interact with the complementary clipping means of the caps (14), the entire assembly being such that, when the caps (14) are connected as the bar (13), superposition of the bar (13) of caps over the set (1) of containers (2) gives rise to the correct angular positioning of the clipping means of the caps with respect to those (7) of the containers; the caps (14) are arranged to ensure leaktight closure of the container by snap-fit positioning, the clipping means being, moreover, provided in order to permit opening of the container (2) by means of a rotational movement of the lid (14) when the container (2), equipped with its cap (14), has been separated from the set (1).

<CLAIMS>
Combination of a row (1) of containers (2) joined 
to one another by linking means (3) which can be easily 

broken, with their axes parallel, in particular situated 
in the same plane, and of a strip (13) of closure 

elements (14) joined to one another by linking means 
which can also be broken easily, in an arrangement 

similar to that of the containers, so that the strip (13) 
of closure elements can be placed on the mouths (5) of 

the containers in the row by a translational movement 
parallel to the axes of the containers, characterized in 

that the containers (2) are of the bottle-type, the 
closure elements are caps (14) and the mouths are necks 

(5) onto which the caps (14) are fitted, click-fastening 
means (7) being provided on the necks (5) of the containers 

to interact with complementary click-fastening 
means (16) of the caps (14), the assembly being such that 

when the caps (14) are connected in a strip (13), when 
the strip (13) of caps is placed above the row (1) of 

containers (2), the click-fastening means (16) of the 
caps are placed in the correct angular position relative 

to those (7) of the containers, the caps (14) being 
designed to close the containers in a leaktight fashion 

by being snapped into place, these click-fastening means 
(7, 16) furthermore being provided to allow each container 

(2) to be opened by rotating its cap (14) once the 
container (2), equipped with its cap (14), has been 

separated from the row (1). 
Combination according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the click-fastening means (7) on the container 

comprise at least one projecting thread portion (8) 
provided on the neck of the container, with a stop (10, 

11) at each end of the thread portion, whilst the cap 
(14) comprises at least one catch (17) capable of clicking 

into place behind the thread portion (8) by fitting 
between the stops (10, 11). 
Combination according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that each cap (14) comprises a window (19) on its 

wall, above the catch (17).  
 
Combination according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the thread portion (8) of the neck (5) of the 

container is bordered above by an inclined surface (9), 

whilst the lower face of the catch (17) of the cap (14) 
is bordered by an inclined wall (18) intended to interact 

with the abovementioned inclined surface (9). 
Combination according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that each cap (14) comprises at least 

one male slope (20) capable of coming into a position 
above the thread portion (8) provided on the neck (5) of 

the container, after click-fastening, the interaction of 
this slope (20) and the thread (8), during a rotational 

movement, raising the cap (14) relative to the container 
(2), while the stops (10, 11) are passed by the catch 

(17) of the cap, which deforms elastically. 
Combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cap (14) comprises an 

inner skirt (21) capable of engaging leaktightly, by 
translational movement, inside the neck (5) of the 

associated container. 
Combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the click-fastening means 

(7, 16) are diametrically opposite on the necks (5) of 
the containers and on the caps (14), and are arranged 

symmetrically relative to the plane of the axes (A) of 
the containers in the row (1). 
Assembly of a bottle-type container (2) and a cap 
(14), the container comprising, on its neck (5), at least 

one projecting thread portion (8), the said cap (14) comprising 
at least one catch (17) capable of clicking into 

place under the thread portion (8), borne by the neck of 
the container, it being possible for the said cap (14) to 

be separated from the container by rotating it, characterized 
in that the thread portion (8) borne by the neck 

(5) of the container (2) includes a stop (10, 11) at each 
of its ends, the catch (17) of the cap (14) being capable 

of clicking into place by fitting between the said stops, 
the cap (14) comprising on its wall, above the catch (17) 

a window (19) and at least one male slope (20) capable of  
 

coming into a position above the thread portion (8) 
provided on the neck (5) of the container (2) after 

click-fastening. 
Assembly according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the container comprises two diametrically opposite 

plane faces (22).
