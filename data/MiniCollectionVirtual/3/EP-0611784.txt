<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed polyfunctional vinyl ether compounds 
are represented by formula (I): 


wherein n = 0 - 20; R₁ and R₂ = H, X, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, 
alkoxy, aryloxy, or cycloalkyl; Q = -OH or -OROCH=CH₂, 

R being C₁₋₁₂. The molar ratio (-OH)/(-OROCH=CH₂) = 10/90 - 

90/10; and A = a C₁₋₃₀ divalent hydrocarbon group. Alternative 
structures for the end groups and optional alternating 

intermediate groups are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyfunctional vinyl 
ether compounds and photoresist resin compositions containing 
such compounds. As a photopolymerizable monomer for a negative 
working photoresist, acrylate resins such as a polyfunctional 
epoxy acrylate and a polyfunctional acrylate, and epoxy 
resins are known. As a resin composition for a positive working photoresist, 
a combination of a novolac resin and quinonediazide 
compound is known and has been widely used. As a negative working photoresist resin composition 
containing a photopolymerizable monomer having a vinyloxyalkyl 
group, compositions described in JP-A-60-7165, 
JP-A-63-71840, and JP-A-01-88538 (the term "JP-A" as used 
herein means a "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application") are known. The photopolymerizable monomers 
having a vinyloxyalkyl group shown in these publications are 
all vinyloxyalkylated products of a novolac obtained by 
condensing a monohydric phenol such as phenol and cresol, and 
an aldehyde, e.g., formalin, and are different from the  
 
photopolymerizable monomer used in the present invention 
described hereinafter. The conventional negative working photoresist using 
an acrylate resin as a photopolymerizable monomer encounters 
a problem in that the occurrence of polymerization hindrance 
with oxygen on hardening of the photoresist is inevitable, 
and therefore the hardenability of the surface of the 
hardening film is insufficient. Thus, the photoresist is 
required to be handled carefully on hardening, such that 
nitrogen purging is applied, the surface of the photoresist 
film is overcoated with an oxygen intercepting layer and the 
like. In the case of a negative working photoresist resin 
composition utilizing the photo ring-opening polymerization 
of an epoxy group which does not cause a polymerization 
hindrance with oxygen, the composition has another problem in 
that the hardening rate is slower than that of the acrylate 
resin composition. Thus, the foregoing photoresist resin compositions do 
not sufficiently meet the characteristics required of a 
resin composition for a photoresist. In the case of the resin compositions each having, as 
a photopolymerizable monomer, the foregoing vinyloxyalkylated 
product of novolac obtained by condensing a monohydric phenol 
and an aldehyde such as formalin disclosed in JP-A-60-7165, 
JP-A-63-71840, and JP-A-01-88538 described above, it is  
 
difficult to simultaneously obtain a high sensitivity and a 
developability with an aqueous diluted alkali
