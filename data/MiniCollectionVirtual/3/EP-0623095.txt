<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to hydrogen peroxide manufacture, and catalyst therefor, by direct oxidation of hydrogen with oxygen in an acidic aqueous medium. The catalyst includes a Group VIII metal on a partially hydrophobic, partially hydrophilic support, such as Pd on fluorinated carbon. Improvements in H2O2 selectivity and catalyst stability are achieved by adding a source of sodium and chloride ions to the reaction medium and, in the case of a fluorinated carbon support, adding a source of fluoride ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTION PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for the production of hydrogen peroxide by direct catalytic oxidation of hydrogen with oxygen. The invention also relates to a catalyst for such process and a method for producing the catalyst. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydrogen peroxide is commercially produced using a process known as the Riedl-Pfleiderer process. In accordance with this two step process, anthraquinone in a carrier solvent, termed "working solution", is cycled between an oxidation reactor and a hydrogenation reactor to convert hydrogen plus oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Variations to the process have concentrated on the form of anthraquinone, the composition of the working solution and the type of catalyst used. A typical catalyst is palladium, raney nickel, or nickel boride on an inert support. The catalyst may be in the form of a slurry or a fixed bed. Hydrogen is needed at high partial pressures in this reaction posing the risk of explosion. The process is characterized as being complex and capital intensive. Processes for the direct oxidation of hydrogen and oxygen to hydrogen peroxide offer the opportunity to develop a simpler, less costly process. Processes of this nature have been proposed, but to the inventors' knowledge have not been commercialized to date. The difficulties with the heretofore proposed processes include: - low concentrations of product - low selectivity (thus high hydrogen consumption) - low reaction rates 

 - hazardous operating conditions (particularly hydrogen partial pressure requirements in the explosive range) and - high acid content. Exemplary of such processes are the following patents, all of which include catalytic conversion of hydrogen with oxygen in an acidic aqueous medium: US 4,009,252 issued to Izumi et al. reports good product concentrations (9 - 12% H202 by wt.) by operating at high acid concentrations (1 gpl HC1 plus 49 gpl H2S04) using Pd deposited on silicic acid, and oxygen to hydrogen molar ratios of 1.5 to 20, well into the explosive range for hydrogen. Seleσtivities for hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide were good with many examples in the range of from 80 - 89%. Reaction rates were generally low, ranging from less than 1 to just over 6 g of hydrogen peroxide per litre-hour. US 4,661,337 issued to Brill reports high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and high reaction rates using Pd deposited on carbon in an aqueous solution containing 35 gpl HC1, by operating a stirred reactor in such
