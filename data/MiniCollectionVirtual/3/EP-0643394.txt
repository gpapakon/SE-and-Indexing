<ABSTRACT>
Device for comparing the write and read timings of a buffer memory (1), the said buffer memory being controlled, in write mode and in read mode, by respectively write and read control means, incorporating a respectively write (4) and read (6) counter incremented by a so-called respectively write and read timing signal, and one at least of these counters being a counter other than a binary counter, characterised in that this comparison device includes:   - associated with such a counter, a means of counting in binary (11, 13), incremented by the same timing signal as the counter with which it is associated, - means (14) of comparing binary states arising either from two such means of counting in binary, in the case where each of the two counters, write and read, is associated with such a means of counting in binary, or on the one hand from a binary counter and on the other hand from such a means of counting in binary, in the case where one of the two counters, write and read, is a binary counter and where the other of these two counters is associated with such a means of counting in binary.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for comparing the write and read rates of a buffer memory (1),
said buffer memory being controlled in writing and in reading by write control

means and read control means, respectively, including a write counter (4)
incremented by a write clock signal and a read counter (6) incremented by a

read clock signal, one of the counters (6) being a binary counter, and the
other counter (4) being a non-binary counter;

   
characterized
 in that said rate comparison apparatus comprises:

associated with the non-binary counter (4), binary count means (11,
13) incremented by the same clock signal (HE) as increments the non-binary

counter;
strobe means (12) sampling the count states of said binary counter
means (11, 13) and controlled by a clock signal derived from the clock signal

(HL) used for incrementing the binary counter (6); and
comparator means (14) for comparing the binary states coming firstly
from the strobe means (12) and secondly from the binary counter (6).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that with said comparison
being performed at a rate other than the count rate of the non-binary counter

(4), said binary count means (11, 13) comprises a Gray code counter (11),
and converter means (13) for converting Gray code into binary, and operating

on the states from said Gray code counter.
