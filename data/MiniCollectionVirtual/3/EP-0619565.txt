<ABSTRACT>
An automated transaction system employs portable rate cards having embedded 
memories for storing rate information corresponding to different services, and a 

terminal which receives an inserted rate card and operates to calculate the value of an 
item requested at the terminal by a user using the information stored in the rate card, 

and to dispense the requested item having the calculated value. In the preferred system, 
the rate cards are used for different postal carriers or different services of one carrier, 

and the item dispensed is a printed postmark corresponding to the value calculated and 
the selected carrier or service. The system also employs portable program cards which 

store programs for generating waybill forms used by different postal carriers or 
different postal services. The waybill generating program of a program card inserted 

in the terminal controls the display of the corresponding waybill form on the terminal 
display and the input of information to be printed on the resulting waybill.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automated transaction
system which receives with a user card having a microprocessor
for executing secure transactions in which an
article or item of value is dispensed from a terminal, and
an account balance stored in the card's memory is debited.
In particular, the invention is applied to a postage
transaction system. in which a postage account is maintained
within the microprocessor card and is used in
transactions with postage printing and metering terminals.EP-A-0 137 737 discloses a microprocessor-based
mailing system having a disk drive for insertion by a user
of a floppy disk, a processor for executing system functions
including the function of transacting postage value
through the system and a keyboard connected to the
processor for enabling a user to input a request for postage
to be transacted. A plurality of floppy disks are provided,
each disk storing rate information corresponding
to a respective one of a plurality of different postage
services to be transacted through said system, which
also includes connecting lines for establishing a connection
between its processor and the disk drive receiving
the floppy disk. The operating processor includes a
stored program for executing a rate calculation procedure
for calculating the postage value of a requested
item using the rate information stored in the memory of
the floppy disk and a value printer is provided for printing
a requested item of postage in accordance with the postage
value calculated by the operating processor.Point-of-sale (POS) terminals and automated teller
machines (ATM) have been widely used in conjunction
with various types of cards issued to users for sale or
credit transactions. For example, banks regularly issue
account cards which have a magnetically coded number
stored on a stripe for accessing the user's account
through ATM terminals. Credit cards which have coded
magnetic stripes are inserted in ATM or POS terminals
to access a central account system for authorization of
a credit transaction. There also have been proposals to
use cards which have large non-volatile memories, e.g.
magnetic, integrated circuit (IC), or optical memory storage,
for storing and retrieving information specific to the
user, such as a medical history, biographical history,
maintenance of an account balance and transaction history,
etc.These conventional systems generally employ a
card which has a passive memory that is read in a card
reader or computerized terminal maintained by a vendor.
