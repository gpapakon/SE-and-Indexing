<ABSTRACT>
A holographic center high mounted stoplight system is 
disclosed that includes a light source (15) for providing a 

nearly collimated beam, an expanding lens (22) responsive to 
the nearly collimated beam for providing a diverging or converging 

reconstruction beam, and a stoplight hologram (20) 
responsive to the expanding beam for producing stoplight 

illumination. Also disclosed is a holographic center high 
mounted stoplight system that includes a light source for 

providing a nearly collimated beam, a light bending hologram 
for providing a diffracted near collimated beam, and an expanding 

stoplight lens array responsive to the diffracted near collimated 
beam for providing non-collimated stoplight illumination (Fig.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a holographic stoplight system, 
comprising means for providing a near collimated beam, and a 
stoplight hologram assembly for producing stoplight illumination. Such a holographic stoplight system is known from 
US-A-4,966,426.  
 The disclosed invention is directed generally to holographic 
center high mounted stoplights for vehicles, and 
more particularly to a holographic center high mounted 
stoplight that includes a source of nearly collimated light 
and an expanding lens to produce an ultimately diverging 
reconstruction beam from the nearly collimated light. Present U.S. federal regulations require center high 
mounted stoplights (CHMSLs) in addition to the standard 
stoplights mounted in the rear portion of an automobile. 
The high mounted stoplights are intended to maximize the 
visibility of the automobile braking indicators to drivers 
following the braking vehicle, and are commonly mounted on 
or near the rear window of an automobile. High mounted stoplights have commonly been implemented 
as a standard lenticular lens, a red filter, an illuminating 
incandescent bulb, and a reflector enclosed in a 
housing that is typically secured adjacent the top or 
bottom of an automobile rear window. However, the bulky 
housing partially obscures the rearward vision of the 
driver, and moreover imposes limitations on the design of 
the automobile. Center high mounted stoplights have been also integrated 
into automobile body parts such as rear decks,  
 
spoilers, roofs, which to some degree substantially reduce 
or remove the rearward vision problem. However, such 
stoplights are complex and may impose limitations on the 
design of the automobile. Holographic center high mounted stoplights have also 
been developed in order to efficiently meet the stoplight 
regulations. Known holographic center high mounted stoplights 
include those which utilize a nearly collimated 
reconstruction beam for efficient utilization of the light 
output of an incandescent bulb, and for compactness of the 
stoplight hologram. However, a consideration with the use 
of a collimated reconstruction beam is the potential hazard 
of the zero order (non-diffracted) reconstruction illumination 
that is transmitted by the stoplight hologram. As is 
well known, holograms have rather restrictive requirements 
for both wavelength and angle of the reconstruction light. 
These requirements would not normally be met by all of the 
light emitted by a standard light source, and thus a 
significant amount of light
