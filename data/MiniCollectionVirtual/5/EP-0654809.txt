<ABSTRACT>
A method for production of graph scales of a panel of a cathode-ray tube for an oscilloscope for forming the panel graph 
scales by exposing and developing a slurry precipitate on a panel through a mask having cathode scales. More particularly, the 

present invention relates to a panel graph scale production method of a novel type characterized in that a specific filter having 
light transmissivity of about 62 % at the center is disposed between the mask and a light source. According to this method, it is not 

necessary to arrange a large number of parallel ray lenses between the mask and the light source as opposed to the prior art, the 
distance between the panel and the light source can be drastically reduced, the overall exposure system for producing the scales 

can be greatly simplified, and the intended panel graph scales can be produced under an ideal condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new method for forming graph scales 
on the panel of a CRT for oscilloscope, in method for forming graph scales 
on the panel by Exposition & Development System being characteristic of 
placing between a negative mask for the graph scale patterns and a light 
source a specific filter whose light transmissivity at its center is about 62% 
and gets larger along from its center to its peripheral portions. In general, for example as shown in FIG. 1, the graph scale patterns 
including the scales for graph coordinates 1 and other necessary numerical 
values 2 are drawn on the surface of the panel(P) of the CRT for a 
oscilloscope. In the past, these graph scale patternes had been made by the 
method of attaching on the panel a transparent plastic board on which the 
necessary graph patterns are provided, but recently either by one method in 
which the graph patterns are directly drawn on the panel surface before 
complishing a glass bulb consisting of a Panel part and a Funnel part or by 
another method of forming the necessary graph scale patterns on the inner 
surface of the panel by light exposure and development means well known 
to the CRT manufacturers. In the above, the latter is preferred above all 
owing to its lower cost and the advantage in recycling the glass bulb.  One recent method frequently used by the CRT manufacturers is as 
follows ;
 
The inside of a glass bulb which is arranged so that its panel part be 
downward is filled with a slurry comprising suitable pigment, water, 
photo-sensitive agents and so on. And a negative mask(M)-a film on which 
a negative graph scale patterns 1' are provided for example as shown in 
FIG. 2 is arranged outside the panel part in parallel to the panel part. Then, 
the necessary graph scale patterns are obtained by exposing and developing 
the slurry precipitates deposited on the inner surface of the panel part of the 
bulb by the light from a light source. The above mentioned method has the problems as follows; 
1. The mercury lamp generally used in this method does not provide 
monochromatic light beams but provides the light beams of various 
wavelenghts. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the correct graph scale 
patterns since the refractive index of the light beams passing through the 
collimating lens means are different from each other. 2. The light is likely to disperse when it passes through the lens means 
since the lamp is not a point-light source but a surface-light source. 3. The light also disperses due to
