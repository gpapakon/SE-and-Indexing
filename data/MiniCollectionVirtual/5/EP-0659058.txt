<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sensing device (10) for capturing acoustic heart sounds. The sensing device has a diaphragm (12) formed from a piezoelectric transducer material which generates excitation signals in response to acoustic and vibratory energy outputs. The sensing device includes metallization layers (14, 16) on the diaphragm for receiving and transmitting the excitation signals to an ouput display device via associated electrical contacts (18, 20) and electrical leads (24, 26) and also includes a layer of adhesive material (34) for coupling the sensing device to the subject. The sensing device further includes snap connectors (36, 38) for allowing the device to be quickly disengaged from electrical leads and discarded. A patch sensor device (62) is disclosed which enables acoustic outputs to be triangulated and pinpointed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved sensing device
for capturing cardiac output (S1 and S2) and acoustic and
vibratory outputs from arterial blood flow off the chest and
appendages.There are many types of sensors, transducers and pickups
used in general industrial applications. Several are
specifically designed to capture heart sounds and body noises.
One such sensor or pickup for heart sounds is a condenser
microphone. This type of microphone is specifically designed
for 2-D phonocardioaraphy systems for capturing heart sounds off
the human chest for interpretation.Other prior art devices include accelerometers and
piezoelectric crystal devices for capturing low frequency
vibrations off the human chest as an indication of heart muscle
damage. Apexcariography, vectorcardiography and
seismocardiograph equipment all use probes to capture signals
off the flesh.One of the inherent drawbacks of these prior art devices is
the fact that they rely on rigid metal or ceramic sensors which
do not conform to the curves, appendages and/or body hair of a
subject. This makes any type of integral mechanical coupling
very difficult. As a result, the efficiency and thus the
accuracy of the sensor is greatly diminished and critical heart
sound energy, which is an integral part of the detection and
diagnosis of heart disease, is lost.Some prior art sensors, for this purpose and other
industrial applications, are formed by accelerometers and
piezoelectric crystals epoxied onto appendages of the body.
None of these sensors however has a desirable set of pliable
conformance characteristics. Still further none of these known
sensors utilize quick connect and disconnect leads on the sensor
for electrical lead connection. EP-A-0 325 805 discloses a sensor for non-invasive
measurement of sound, pressure or vibrations from a human
body and has a sensor cell featuring a probe which can be
placed on the surface of the body to sense mechanical input
variables. The sensor has a housing within which is located
a transducer having a piezoelectric foil diaphragm which is
coupled to the probe and which converts the mechanical input
variables into an electrical signal.The diaphragm has metallization layers on its
opposed surfaces and there is an air gap between the housing
and one of the metallization layers. WO90/08506 relates to a sound sensor apparatus for
receiving bio-acoustic signals from the body of a patient.
The apparatus comprising a unitary containment structure for
conforming to the patient's body surface and which
