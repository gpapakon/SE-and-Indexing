<ABSTRACT>
Dispersions, in particular dispersion paints, and corresponding solid particles are removed from all types of waste waters (effluents) (35), even oily waste waters, by adding at least one flocculent (42), homogeneously mixed, and separating off the flocculated product (36). To generate a mixing motion, the recycled cleaned waste water (68) is passed into the reaction duct (40) and is further used for prewashing. The apparatus for carrying out the process essentially comprises a disposal apparatus (38) having an upper reaction part (40) for mixing and flocculation and a lower filter part (10). The reaction part (40) is equipped with an integral hydraulic mixer (46) and the filter part (10) is equipped with an exchangeable filter (76). Both the reaction part (40) and the filter part (10) have a closable outlet.
