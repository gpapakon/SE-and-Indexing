<ABSTRACT>
In embodiments of flash Eeprom arrays (80), an access transistor (92) is included in each cell (82) thereof, in series with the floating transistor (90) of the cell, the access transistor (92) being used to avoid the problem of drain disturbance in cells (84, 86, 88) other than the cell being programmed. The connection of the control gates (104) in certain cells of these arrays is such that gate disturbance in the floating gate transistors in those cells not being programmed is reduced or eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLASH E2PROM ARRAYField of the InventionThis invention relates to memory arrays, and more particularly to flash E2PROM arrays.Background of the InventionFig. l shows a typical flash E2PROM cell 10 of the prior art. The cell 10 is made up of a transistor 11 having a substrate 12 of, for example, P type conductivity, with a source 14 and a drain 16 of N type conductivity along a surface of a substrate, the source 14 and drain 16 defining therebetween a channel region 18 along the surface of the substrate 12. Overlying the channel region 18 is an oxide layer 20 on which is disposed a first polysilicon layer 22. The polysilicon layer 22 has disposed thereon an oxide layer 24, which in turn has disposed thereon a second polysilicon layer 26. The polysilicon layer 22 is the floating gate of the device 10, while the polysilicon layer 26 is the control gate thereof.As is well known, the threshold voltage of the transistor 11 can be changed by addition of electrons to the floating gate 22, or removal of electrons therefrom. In adding electrons to the floating gate 22 (programming the cell) , typical of a flash E2PROM cell, the control gate 26 and drain 16 are held at a high positive voltage, while the source 14 is held at ground, the voltage being sufficient to bring the transistor 11 into an avalanche condition, so that hot electrons pass through the oxide 20 into the floating gate 22. For removal of electrons from the floating gate 22 (erasing the cell) , again typical of a flash E2PR0M cell, a high positive voltage is applied to the source 14, while the control gate 26 is held at 

ground, so that electrons are drawn from the floating gate 22 through the oxide 20 to the source 14.A schematic representation of such a prior art E2PR0M memory cell is shown in Fig. 2. As noted therein, the bit line BL is connected to the drain 14 of the transistor 10, while the word line L is connected to the control gate 26.A prior art array 31 of cells of the type shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is shown in Fig. 3. The array of Fig. 3 includes for illustrative purposes four such cells 32, 34, 36, 38, each cell including a single transistor as described above. A first bit line BL1 is connected to the drain 14A, 14B of each transistor HA, 11B in a first column of cells 32, 34, while the source 16A, 16B of each such transistors 11A, 11B is connected to ground. A second bit line BL2 is connected to the drain 14C, 14D of each transistor 11C, 11D in a second column of cells 36, 38, with the source 16C, 16D of each such transistor connected
