<ABSTRACT>
In order to separate within a fluid (1) some of the particles (2) present in the latter, this fluid is arranged in a channel (C) partly bounded by two faces which are near and substantially parallel to each other and to the direction of separation E and at the same there is applied to the whole volume of the fluid present in this channel, in a direction which has at least one component perpendicular to the direction E, an exciting field which varies along the said direction according to a curve consisting of a uniform series of mutually identical unsymmetrical units, the mean of this field performed at each instant along the direction E being nil, and means are provided for repeatedly varying the effect of the exciting field on the particles.

<CLAIMS>
Method for separating, within a fluid (1), 
certain particles (2) contained therein, according to 

which this fluid is arranged in a zone, called the 
separation zone, of a chamber (C), which extends along 

the separation direction E and an exciting field is 
simultaneously applied over the entirety of the said 

zone, which field varies along the direction E in a curve 
consisting of a regular sequence of essentially mutually 

identical patterns, the mean of the said exciting field, 
taken at each instant along the direction E, being 

essentially zero, characterized in that the fluid remains 
stationary in the zone in question, in that the 

patterns of the sequence are asymmetric, and in that 
means are provided for repetitively varying the effect of 

the exciting field on the particles contained in the zone 
in question. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means for repetitively varying the effect of the 

exciting field on the particles to be separated act on 
the amplitude of this exciting field. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the means which act on the amplitude of the exciting 

field employ a repeated sequence of operating cycles, 
each composed of two phases, the first phase, extending 

over a first period (t
1
), consisting in simultaneously 
applying a pulse of the exciting field over the entirety 

of each separation zone, and the second phase, extending 
over a second period (t
2
), consisting in cancelling the 
said field. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the duration of the second period (t
2
) of each cycle 
is of the same order of magnitude as, or shorter than, 

the diffusion time of the particles to be separated over 

a distance equal to the pitch of the array consisting of 
the succession of assymetric patterns. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the means which act on the amplitude of the exciting 

field apply this exciting field to each separation zone  
 

in a sinusoidal, optionally modulated, manner, the time 
period of the sinusoidal signal being chosen depending on 

the particles to be separated. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the means for repetitively varying the effect of the 

exciting field on the particles to be separated act on the 
sensitivity of the said particles to this field. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that 
a sensitizing field is superposed on the exciting field over 

all the separations zones, which sensitizing field is 
capable of temporarily inducing transition of the particles 

to be separated into a state in which their sensitivity to 
the exciting field is different from that which they have in 

their ground state. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each pattern has the shape of an 

asymmetric V. 
Method according to claim 8, characterized in that 
the asymmetry of each V, expressed as a ratio between the 

length of the projection on the separation direction E of 
its less steep side and that of its steeper side, is of the 

order of 10. 
Separation device for implementing the method 
according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 

exciting field is of electric type, characterized in that 
each separation zone is defined by at least two electrodes 

(3, 4), in that at least one of the said electrodes (4) has 
a profile (5), along the separation direction E, which 

consists of a regular sequence of mutually identical 
asymmetric patterns, which patterns are referred to hereinbelow 

as "striae", and in that it includes means for 
repetitively varying the effect of the exciting field. 
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the pitch of the array of striae lies between a few thousands 

of ångströms and a few millimetres. 
Device according to any one of claims 10 and 11,  
 

characterized in that the striated electrode (23) has a 
second, identical striated electrode (24) lying alongside 

it, which second electrode is offset, in particular by one 
half pitch, with respect to the first, and in that means 

(27) are provided for alternately powering these two 
electrodes. 
Device according to any one of claims 10 to 12, 
characterized in that the separation zones have the form of 

a corridor (C) defined in part by two faces which are close 
together and substantially parallel to each other and to the 

direction E of entrainment or separation, and in that the 
mean distance between these two faces is of the order of 

magnitude of the pitch of the array of striae. 
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that 
the two parallel faces which define the corridor are 

identically striated and are arranged so their edges lie 
opposite each other in pairs on either side of the said 

corridor. 
Device according to claim 14, characterized in that 
the corridor consists of a plurality of mutually parallel 

corridor sections, each electrode lying between two adjacent 
parallel corridor sections then being in the form of a part 

(19, 20, 21, 22) lined with striae on two parallel opposite 
faces, which gives it a general elongate Christmas-tree 

shape. 
Device according to any one of claims 10 to 15, 
characterized in that the electrodes have been subjected to 

a surface treatment making it possible to prevent adhesion 
onto them by the particles to be separated.
