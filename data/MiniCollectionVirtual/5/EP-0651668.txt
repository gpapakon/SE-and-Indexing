<ABSTRACT>
A breathing device comprising a bag of flexible material (1) and a flexible hose (4) in fluid communication with the interior of the bag. The flexible hose is provided with a mouthpiece (6) so as to allow a wearer of the device to exhale into the bag and to inhale from the bag via said mouthpiece and said flexible hose. The hose is in fluid communication with the interior of the bag at a plurality of locations (10, 11, 13) mutually spaced across the bag to ensure proper communication between the hose and the interior of the bag even when the bag becomes partially flattened due to external pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a breathing device, for example for 
use in an emergency situation. It is well known that exhaled breath 
still contains sufficient oxygen for a person to breathe in and out 
several times the same breath. In an emergency situation it can be 
of vital importance for such person to have a breathing device at 
his disposition, which device allows the person to exhale and 
subsequently inhale his breath several times until conditions are 
safe for normal breathing. Such an emergency situation can for 
example occur when a person in an aircraft cast in the sea following 
an accident is carried underwater before being able to free himself 
from the aircraft, or in case of a fire when a person has to escape 
through smoke which prevents normal breathing. EP-A-0 361 626 discloses a breathing device consisting of a bag 
to which a flexible hose provided with a mouthpiece is connected. 
During normal circumstances the bag is empty, whereas in case of an 
emergency the wearer uses the bag to exhale and inhale the same 
breath several times by breathing through the mouthpiece. A problem 
of the known device is that during a submerged position of the 
wearer the flexible hose can become shut-off at the connection to 
the bag due to the water pressure acting on the bag. Another problem 
of the known device is that water which has entered the bag can 
block fluid communication between the air in the bag and the 
mouthpiece. It is an object of the invention to provide a breathing device 
which overcomes the problems of the known device and which allows a 
wearer to breath in and out the same breath several times. In accordance with the invention there is provided a breathing 
device comprising a bag of flexible material and a flexible hose in 
fluid communication with the interior of the bag, the flexible hose 
being provided with a mouthpiece so as to allow a wearer of the 
device to exhale into the bag and to inhale from the bag via said 
mouthpiece and said flexible hose, wherein the hose is in fluid  
 
communication with the interior of the bag at a plurality of 
locations mutually spaced across the bag. The feature that the hose 
is in fluid communication with the bag at said plurality of 
locations ensures that an amount of air present in the bag remains 
in fluid communication with the mouthpiece even when the bag 
becomes partially flattened due to external pressure, or when water 
has entered the bag. Preferably, the flexible hose is in fluid communication with 
the interior of the

<CLAIMS>
A breathing device comprising a bag (1) of flexible material 
and a flexible hose in fluid communication with the interior of the 

bag, the flexible hose (4) being provided with a mouthpiece (6) so 
as to allow a wearer of the device to exhale into the bag and to 

inhale from the bag via said mouthpiece (6) and said flexible hose 
(4), characterized in that the hose (4) is in fluid communication 

with the interior of the bag (1) at a plurality of locations 
mutually spaced across the bag (1). 
The breathing device of claim 1, wherein the flexible hose (4) 
is in fluid communication with the interior of the bag (1) via a 

manifold (5) having a plurality of passages (10, 11, 13), each 
passage being in fluid communication with the interior of the bag 

(1) at a respective one of said locations mutually spaced across the 
bag (1). 
The breathing device of claim 2, wherein said manifold (5) 
extends externally from the bag (1) and comprises a main conduit (7) 

which is at one end thereof connected to the flexible hose (4) and 
which is at the other end thereof closed, and a plurality of branch 

conduits (10, 11, 13), each branch conduit (10, 11, 13) extending 
from the main conduit (7) to the bag (1) and forming a respective 

one of said passages. 
The breathing device of claim 3, wherein at least one branch 
conduit (10, 11, 13) has an end part (15, 17, 19) extending within 

the bag (1), which end part (15, 17, 19) has at least one opening 
(27, 29, 31) provided in the wall thereof. 
The breathing bag of claim 4, wherein said end part (15, 17, 
19) of the branch conduit (10, 11, 13) is provided with an annular 

shoulder surrounding the passage formed by the branch conduit and 
located at the inward end of said branch conduit. 
The breathing device of claim 2, wherein said manifold includes 
a conduit (74) extending within the bag (60), said passages of the  

 
manifold being formed by a plurality of openings (76) provided in 

the wall of said conduit (74). 
The breathing bag of claim 6, wherein said conduit (74) rests 
in an elastically deformed state against the inner surface of the 

wall of the bag (60). 
The breathing device of any one of claims 2-7, wherein the 
flexible hose (4) and the manifold are integrally formed. 
The breathing device of any one of claims 1-8, wherein said 
mouthpiece (6) is provided with a directional valve which in a first 

mode of operation thereof allows the wearer to exhale into the bag 
(1, 60) and to inhale from the bag (1, 60), and in a second mode of 

operation thereof allows the wearer to breathe from atmosphere. 
The breathing device of any one of claims 1-9, further 
comprising means (64) for attaching the bag (1, 60) to an immersion 

suit of the wearer.
