<ABSTRACT>
A fastener member for moulding includes a fastener tape 
having engaging elements (4) on the top of its substrate and also 

ridges (3) extending in the longitudinal direction on both edges 
of the back of the substrate, the ridge (3) projecting outwards 

such that its outermost part is about 0.3 to 5 mm from the 
outer edge of the substrate. For producing a plastic moulded 

article having the fastener members moulded thereon, the 
above-mentioned fastener member is fitted in the recess of 

the mould such that the engaging elements on its surface are 
directed to the recess of the mould and the ridges (3) of the 

fastener member substantially seal the gap between the fastener 
member and the side wall (7) of the recess (6) of the mould, 

and a resinous composition is injected into the mould.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastener member for
moulding which is embedded in the surface of a cushion when
an automotive seat cushion or office chair cushion is
moulded. The fastener member moulded in the cushion is used
to fix the upholstery material (such as cloth) covering the
cushion.An automotive seat or office chair is usually made up of
a cushion of foamed polyurethane or the like and an upholstery
material covering it. According to prior art technology,
the cushion has moulded wires and the upholstery is attached
to the cushion by means of metal fixing members which
engage the moulded wires and the upholstery. This procedure
is accomplished by means of an electric tool.A new method utilising insert moulding has recently been
proposed for the production of an automotive seat. This
method involves the steps of inserting flat fastener tapes in
the recesses of the mould, injecting a foaming resin into the
mould, and expanding the resin such that the fastener tapes
are integrally embedded in the surface of the cushion. The
fastener tape has a large number of engaging elements on its
top and a large number of anchoring elements on its back. The
moulded cushion, therefore, has the engaging elements bared
on its surface The cushion is finally covered with an upholstery
material having elements capable of engagement with the
engaging elements of the fastener tape.The above-mentioned procedure needs a provision for preventing
the foaming resin from entering the gap between the
fastener tape and the recess of the mould in which it is fitted,
because there is a chance for the engaging elements to
be buried in the foamed resin entering the gap.This problem is solved by the use of a fastener member
as shown in Figure 9. There, the fastener member A is made of 
a flat fastener tape E, a steel strip F, and a cover film G.
The flat fastener tape E has a large number of engaging elements
C and anchoring elements D formed on both sides of its
substrate. The steel strip F, which is placed on the engaging
elements C, causes the fastener tape E to be attracted to the
magnet J arranged in the recess of the mould. The cover film
G covers the steel strip F and the engaging elements C. The
cover film G has its periphery bonded to the periphery of the
flat fastener tape E by adhesion or heat sealing.Prior to the moulding operation, the fastener member A
is fixed in position by the magnetic force exerted on the
steel strip F by the magnet J arranged in the recess K of the
mould. Subsequently, a foaming resin is

<CLAIMS>
A fastener member, comprising:

a tape-like substrate (1) having engaging elements (2)
on its front and ridges (3) extending continuously along both

its longitudinal edges,
characterised
 in that
the ridges (3) are formed on the back of the substrate
(1) and each ridge has an enlarged portion (18, 19) on its

top and its outermost part projects about 0.3 to 5 mm beyond
the respective edge of the substrate (1).
A fastener member according to claim 1, wherein the substrate
(1) and the ridges (3) are commonly formed by extrusion

through a die.
A fastener member according to any of claims 1 to 2,
having anchoring elements (4) on its back.
A process for producing a plastic moulded article having
a fastener member moulded thereon, comprising the following

steps:

fitting a fastener member as defined in any of claims 1
to 3 in a recess (6) of a mould such that its front side with

the engaging elements faces the recess (6) and the ridges (3)
of the fastener member substantially seal the gap between the

fastener member and the side walls of the recess (6), and 
injecting a resinous composition into the mould to form
said article.
A process according to claim 4, wherein the difference
between the width at the outermost parts of both ridges and

the width of the recess is in the range of -1 to 5 mm and the
difference between the length of the tape-like substrate (1)

and the length of the recess is in the range of -5 to 5 mm.
