<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for reducing the necessary external electrical power rating for lift systems, the electrical power which is required to drive the lift motor being supplied from two electrical power sources. The invention is essentially characterised in that the currents from both the electrical power sources are joined together and added in a device (9) which forms the current sum, on the one hand a constant and previously defined maximum current being drawn from the general mains electrical power supply (1) and the current which is additionally required for acceleration and for operation at the rated rotation speed being drawn from an energy storage device (7) which is charged by a charger (6) which draws primary energy from the general mains electrical power supply (1). In consequence it is possible to reduce the value of the peak current and the external electrical power rating of the lift system.

A device for reducing the necessary nominal value of external power supply for
elevator installations, the power required for operating the elevator motor being

supplied by two power supplies, characterized in that the currents from both power
supplies are brought together and summed up in a current summing device (9), a

constant and previously defined maximum current being drawn from the mains supply
(1), on the one hand, and the additional current required for run-up and operation at

nominal speed being drawn from an energy storage device (7) charged by a charging set
(6) drawing its primary energy from the mains supply, and optimizes the process of

charging to the effect that in case of increased necessity for supplying the motor a quick-charging
mode comes into effect, while at times of low usage, only a float charge mode

is used, and additionally the charging state of the energy storage device (7) is
continuously checked in an electronic control device, so that starting of the motor is

only permitted if sufficient energy supply for the total duration of elevator operation is
guaranteed.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the electrical power drawn
from the mains supply (1) is first rectified in a rectifier circuit (2) and subsequently

brought to a certain d.c. voltage in a converter (3), and that at the same time the
maximum current may be restricted to a certain adjustable value in a current limiting

device (4) independently of the current consumption of the motor (10).
The device according to any of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that optimisation of

cos Ï•
 is calculated in an electronic control device (11) while the motor (10) is in
operation, the motor voltage being lowered in the power component (5) by means of

pulse-width modulation to such an extent that the reactive power reaches a minimum
while monitoring the motor current. 
The device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that in a converter (8)
the voltage of electrical energy drawn from the energy storage device (7) is increased to

the same potential as the output voltage of the current limiter (4) and in that the direct
current drawn from the current summing device (9) for operating the motor is converted

into rotary current in a power component (5) and then supplied to the motor (10).
The device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the power
component (5) for generating rotary current of variable frequency is adapted to

operating the motor.
