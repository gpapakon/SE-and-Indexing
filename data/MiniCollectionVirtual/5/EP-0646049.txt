<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a method for manufacturing low bark content wood chips from whole-tree chips, in which method there are two or more sequential separation stages, which can be divided into pre-separation with a bark content of less than 10 % and final cleaning, and in which the pre-separation consists of at least pneumatic separation and the final cleaning includes sorting based on colour difference. According to the invention, before pneumatic separation the bark is removed from the chips by grinding, which simultaneously reduces the particle size of the bark.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a method for manufacturing low
bark content wood chips from whole-tree chips, in which method
there are two or more sequential separation stages, which can
be divided into pre-separation leading to a bark content of
less than 10 % and a final cleaning, and in which the pre-separation
includes at least pneumatic separation as well as
fines sieving and the final cleaning includes sorting based
on colour separation or generally speaking on optical separation.
In particular the invention is directed towards a
cleaning method for birch and pine whole-tree chips.In present timber harvesting methods a considerable amount of
the timber mass, in this case timber fibre biomass, is left in
the forest, because it is unprofitable to collect it. When
industry in Finland uses annually about 50 million m3 of stemwood
with bark, about 23 million m3 of felling waste remains in
the forest, of which it is estimated that half could be
brought to the mill by using new harvesting technology.Up until now cellulose has been manufactured from stemwood
with bark, from which the bark can easily be removed by means
of drum debarking. The exploitation of waste remaining in the
forest cannot economically be connected to this chain.So far it has not proved possible to use the mass obtained
from forest waste, i.e. from crushed small trees and branches,
in the manufacture of cellulose, because after even modern
cleaning methods the bark content of the mass has been too
great. Fines sieving achieves a bark content of only about 10
%. It is true that patent publications US 4,266,675, CH 643
160, SU 756 460, and SU 531 230 present various kinds of
particle and even chip mass separators which operate on the
principle of recognizing the differences in colour of the
particles, in this case of the chips. These do not always give
satisfactory results in the sorting of whole-tree woodchips
with yield staying low and the remaining bark content staying
high. It is not possible to achieve both a good yield and a 
high degree of cleanliness by purely adjusting the selection
criteria of the separator.From US 4,332,353 a procedure for mechanically raising the wood
content in wood chips is known comprising the steps of:
screening the wood chips in a disc sieve removing from the
chips the stones and other bodies which are oversize or would
damage the equipment;grinding the chips in a dry grinder drum by means of attrition
and impact treatment with grinding bodies of appropriate shape
and weight such as balls for instance,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing low bark content wood
chips from whole-tree chips, in which method there are two or

more sequential separation stages, which can be divided into
pre-separation with a bark content of less than 10 % and final

cleaning, and there is a grinding treatment in order to detach
the bark from chips, 
characterized
 in that the pre-separation
consists of at least a pneumatic separation and the grinding

treatment takes place before the pneumatic separation and it
is done by a plate grinder or a vibrating cone crusher, which

simultaneously reduces the particle size of the bark, and the
final cleaning includes sorting based on colour difference.
A method in accordance with Patent Claim 1, 
characterized

in that the colour difference separation includes two
sequentially connected and so-called cascade connected stages,

i.e. in the first stage clean chips are removed from the cycle
and in the second stage the high bark content reject is

removed.
A method in accordance with Patent Claim 2, 
characterized

in that the first of the cascade connected colour
difference separation is adjusted to separate clean chips with

a bark content of less than 1 % and that the reject from this
stage is fed to a second stage, the fraction approved by the

colour difference separator of which is led back to treatment
and the reject mass with a high bark content is removed from

treatment.
A method in accordance with Patent Claim 3, 
characterized

in that the approved fraction from the second stage is

led back to the grinder in order to remove the bark attached
to the chips.
A method in accordance with Patent Claim 4, 
characterized

in that the blade gap in the plate grinder or correspondingly
the opening gap in the vibrating cone grinder is in

the zone 6 - 14 mm. 
A method in accordance with Patent Claim 5, 
characterized

in that the thickness of the chip size of the whole-tree
chips is initially selected in such a way that the share

of the chips remaining in the 6 - 8 mm (depending on the mill)
gap sieve is reduced to one third.
A method in accordance with one of Patent Claims 1 -
6, 
characterized
 in that in the final cleaning separation is
used that is also based on the recognition of the density

and/or the shape of the chips.
