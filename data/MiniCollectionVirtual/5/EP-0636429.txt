<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for recovering expanding 
agents of chlorofluoroalkane (CFC, HCFC) type incorporated into 
expanded polymeric matrices for recycling. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for 
recovering low boiling chlorofluoroalkanes and/or hydrochlorofluoroalkanes 
adsorbed on rigid polyurethane foams for recycling. 
Ecological and environmental considerations have required the 
problem of the disposal of plastics materials present in solid 
urban refuse to be seriously considered. In Italy the production of solid urban refuse currently increases 
by about 1% per year and is now estimated at 10-20 million tonnes 
per year, of which 1.4 million tonnes (about 7.5%) represents 
plastics materials. Recycling this large quantity of material would enable its 
residual use value to be recovered, with undoubted economical 
advantages and in particular a reduction in the overall volume of 
refuse and in the consumption of virgin material. There would 
also be the possibility of recovering its energy content when at 
the end of its second life cycle it is incinerated in a furnace  
 
using a suitable heat recovery method. Of those plastics materials currently in use, flexible and rigid 
polyurethane foams are of considerable importance, their 
consumption, essentially in the automobile furnishing and thermal 
insulation sectors, being in continuous increase and representing 
about 63% of the European expanded polymer market. The recycling and reuse of this particular class of material, 
either as manufacturing waste or as refuse on termination of its 
life cycle, involves finely grinding the material and using it 
either as an inert filler for producing other polyurethanes, in 
particular by the RRIM method, or as an intermediate in the 
production of raw materials (polyols) by glycolysis or petrochemical 
intermediates by pyrolysis. Polyurethane foams are prepared by reacting a formulated polyol 
with a polyisocyanate, in particular 2,4/2,6-toluenediisocyanate 
(TDI) or 4,4'-diphenylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) and higher 
homologues or their modifications, using as expanding agent 
monofluorotrichloromethane known by the experts of the art as CFC 
11 or other chlorine-containing halogenated or hydrohalogenated 
hydrocarbons. Some of these expanding agents, in particular CFC 11, were 
included in the Montreal protocol in the list of chlorofluoroalkanes 
considered damaging to the environment by contributing to 
the alteration and destruction of the ozone layer present in the 
s
