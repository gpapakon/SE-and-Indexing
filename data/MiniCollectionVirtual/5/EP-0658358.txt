<ABSTRACT>
A flow control valve is described comprised of first 
and second rigid members and a resilient single or multi 

stage valve element disposed between the rigid members. A 
fluid flow path is defined through the rigid members and 

through or around the valve element to provide a continuous 
flow path through the valve. The rigid members are movable 

relative to each other between a first position and a 
second position. The valve element is sufficiently 

compressed by the rigid members when they are in the first 
position so as to close the flow path through or around the 

valve element. The valve element is sufficiently relaxed 
when the rigid members are in the second position to allow 

fluid flow through the flow path through or around the 
valve element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid flow control
devices for regulating the flow of liquid or gas. More
particularly, the present invention relates to flow control
valves and valve elements for use therein that may be used
to regulate the flow of liquid or gas therethrough by
compression or deformation of the valve element.Flow control valves for liquid and gas come in many
shape and sizes, and are made of a wide variety of
materials depending on their intended use.Typically, flow control valves such as butterfly
valves and gate valves are used to control flow of fluid by
moving a mechanical member into and out of the flow path to
partially or completely block the flow path. Other types
of valves, for example roller clamps used in medical
intravenous apparatus, control flow by pinching the plastic
tubing through which the fluid flows. Still other types of
valves operate by controlling the length of the flow path,
and therefore the resistance to flow, through the valve.Despite the wide variety of valves that have been
known or used heretofore, there is a continuing need for
improved flow control valves that have cost, ease of use,
functional, and other advantages compared to prior flow
control valves. EP-A-0 510 851 teaches a valve element adapted to be disposed
within a valve housing for controlling the flow of fluid
through the housing, the valve element comprising a resilient
first valve body, a fluid inlet, a fluid outlet, and a flow
path therebetween defined in the first valve body, whereby the
size of the flow path may be varied by compressive deformation
of the first valve body, the resilient first valve body has a
generally hourglass shape.US 2,442,746 teaches a flow control apparatus comprising a
nipple threadingly connected to a body member. A resilient
plug having a longitudinal straight channel is provided within
a cavity of the body member. As the body member is screwed
down on the nipple, the resilient member is compressed to cut
off flow through the straight channel.US-A-3,685,786 teaches an adjustable orifice valve for applications requiring highly
accurate control over the rate of fluid flow employs a resilient, yieldable body having a
passage of circular cross-section therethrough, and means for compressing the body in a
direction generally parallel to the passage to deform the body inwardly and selectively
determine the size of a circular orifice formed in the passage. The present invention is directed to such a new and
improved flow control valve and valve element for use
therein.
