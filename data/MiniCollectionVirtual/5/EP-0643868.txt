Process for the continuous impregnation of a porous substrate by a doped
electronic conductive polymer consisting of subjecting the moving substrate

to at least one treatment cycle including the following stages:

a) passing the substrate (2) into an aqueous acid and acid solution (6) of
at least one soluble, liquid monomer, polymerizable by oxidation and chosen

from among aniline and its derivatives,
b) drying (8) the impregnated substrate,
c) passing the impregnated, dried substrate into an oxidizing solution
containing a doping agent of the polymer, said solution containing an oxidant

constituted by sodium dichromate,
d) allowing the mixture to react up to the complete oxidation,
e) passing the impregnated substrate of said conductive polymer into an

acid washing solution (12) and
f) drying (14) the washed, impregnated polymer substrate.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the oxidizing solution
is an acid solution with a pH below 2.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the monomer is aniline.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the monomer is used in the form of a salt in aqueous solution.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that there is at least one substrate draining stage following the passage of

said substrate into at least one of the monomer, oxidant and washing
solutions.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that there is a draining stage after passing the substrate into each of the

aniline, oxidant and washing solutions. 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the substrate is sprayed (13) with a clean acid washing solution containing

the same acid as that of the washing solution of stage e, between
stages e and f.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the substrate is sprayed (5) with a clean oxidizing solution of the same

composition as that of the oxidizing solution of stage c, between stages c
and d.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that each stage a to e lasts at the most 10 minutes.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the substrate (2) is a cloth.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the substrate is moved at a speed of 1 to 5 m/min.
Process according to an one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the oxidant has a concentration between 0.005 and 0.02N in the oxidizing

solution.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that there is a continuous renewal (5) of the oxidizing solution of stage c.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that there is a continuous renewal (13) of the washing solution of stage e.
Process according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in that
the acid of stages a, c and e is a hydrochloric acid.
