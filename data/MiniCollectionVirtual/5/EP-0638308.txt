<ABSTRACT>
A water-in-volatile silicone emulsion gel having 
skin moisturizing qualities is disclosed. The gel is formed 

by mixing an oil phase with a water phase. The oil phase 
contains a volatile silicone, a siloxane polyether and an 

oil. The water phase contains water, a humectant and an 
oxyethylene functional organosilane. Matching of the 

refractive index of the oil phase and the water phase 
results in the formation of a crystal clear gel having a 

viscosity in the range of 5,000 to 150,000 mm²/s 
(centistokes).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a gel form of
personal care cosmetic with moisturizing properties which
are beneficial to the alleviation of dry skin conditions.Inadequate hydration of the stratum corneum
results in what is known as dry skin. About ten to twenty
percent moisture is the minimum required in order to
maintain the retention of normal skin softness and
pliability. Accordingly, dry skin sufferers often
supplement their own natural skin hydration by the
application of consumer products containing humectants and
moisturizers. Typically, humectants absorb moisture or aid
another substance in the retention of moisture.
Moisturizers supply moisture or restore moisture levels in
the skin. The goal in either scenario is that of increasing
the water content of the skin in order to maintain a soft
and pliable skin condition. By including emollients, skin
friction is reduced with the result that the skin is enabled
to flex without breaking. This is often accompanied by a
reduction or retardation in the water loss of the skin.Of late, the concentration of clear gel forms of
personal care products on cosmetic counters is on the rise.
Products in clear gel form are very attractive in appearance
and are generally regarded as having superior skin
absorption characteristics in comparison to conventional
emulsion products. Being single phase systems, clear gels
have excellent stability. Since consumers perceive such
products as being pure and hence safer, there is a growing
demand in the marketplace for gel forms of products and
especially products with good shelf-life stability which is
frequently a problem with clear products. WO-92/05767 discloses a clear gel-type cosmetic product
having a viscosity of at least about 50,000 cps at 21 °C,
which includes an emulsion with an oil phase and a water
phase that includes an incorporated active ingredient. The
refractive indices of the water and oil phases match to at
least 0.0004, the refractive index of the product is about
1.4000, and the product clarity is better than thirty NTU. The water-in-volatile silicone emulsion gel
cosmetic of the present invention is a product capable of
fulfilling that market need.The invention introduces a water-in-volatile
silicone emulsion gel having skin moisturizing qualities
which is formed in accordance with the method as defined in claim 1
by mixing together an oil phase and a water
phase. The oil phase contains a volatile silicone, a
siloxane polyether and an emollient. The water phase contains
water, a humectant and an
