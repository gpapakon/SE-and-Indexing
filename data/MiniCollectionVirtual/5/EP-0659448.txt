<ABSTRACT>
A blunt-ended cannula insertion member (318,324) comprises a 
tubular member having a cylindrical region (318) and a frusto-conical 

portion (328) between the blunt end and the cylindrical portion. The blunt 
end is convex and radial apertures, spaced from the end, open from a fluid 

flow path in the tubular member. Longitudinal slots (338) are spaced 
around the tubular member, each open to a respective aperture and each 

having end openings at the distal end of the tapered portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cannula insertion member for use with 
a pre-slit injection device. A cannula insertion member is known, as disclosed in Fig 1 of the 
drawings, comprising a tube defining a fluid flow path therein and having 
a cylindrical region and a blunt distal end for insertion into a pre-slit 
injection site, the tube having an aperture through which fluid can flow to 
or from the fluid flow path. Use of such a blunt cannula with an injection site is also known 
from US-A-4197848. An object of the present invention is to provide a cannula insertion 
member which is designed to facilitate insertion in a pre-slit injection site 
and reduce kickback. The present invention is characterised in that the tube has an 
externally tapered portion of frusto-conical shape between the blunt distal 
end and the cylindrical region, whereby the cylindrical portion enters the 
slit of the injection site behind the tapered portion to reduce kickback 
during insertion; the aperture is spaced from the blunt distal end and opens 
radially from the fluid flow path; the blunt distal end has an arcuate 
surface; and the tube has longitudinally extending slots, which 
communicate through the aperture with the fluid flow path and have distal 
openings at the distal end of the tapered portion, which openings are 
spaced distally of the aperture. These slots enhance fluid flow and inspersion characteristics and  
 
decrease the contact surface area on the tube exterior so as to facilitate 
insertion. In one embodiment, the cannula includes a lead post on the tube 
distal end to guide the cannula through the slit in the injection site. The cannula may carry a locking member for lockingly engaging 
the injection site when the cannula extends into the injection site. The 
locking member may include a luer-type twist lock fitting or have slidably 
engageable members responsive to relative axial movement of the injection 
site and the cannula towards each other. Advantages of a blunt plastics cannula, relative to conventional steel 
needles, include a higher fluid flow rate capacity and a simpler one-piece 
plastics design. US-A-2989053 discloses a hypodermic needle having a pointed 
cannula in which outlet apertures are spaced from the point and the 
portion between the point and the apertures is formed with sharp blades. EP-A-0050459 discloses a spike connector having a sharp point 
with outlet apertures spaced from the point. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:

A cannula insertion member comprising a tube (318,324 and 
348,350) defining a fluid flow path therein and having a cylindrical region 

(318,348) and a blunt distal end for insertion into a pre-slit injection site, 
the tube having an aperture through which fluid can flow to or from the 

fluid flow path,
 
characterised in that: 


the tube has an externally tapered portion (328,352) of frusto-conical 
shape between the blunt distal end and the cylindrical region 

(318,348), whereby the cylindrical portion enters the slit of the injection 
site behind the tapered portion to reduce kickback during insertion; 
the aperture is spaced from the blunt distal end and opens radially 
from the fluid flow path; 
the blunt distal end has an arcuate surface (332,356); and 
the tube has longitudinally extending slots (338,358), which 
communicate through the aperture with the fluid flow path and have distal 

openings at the distal end of the tapered portion (318,348), which 
openings are spaced distally of the aperture. 
An insertion member according to Claim 1, wherein the externally 

tapered portion (328) merges with a centrally located lead post (330) 
provided with the arcuate distal end (332). 
An insertion member according to Claim 1, wherein the externally 
tapered portion (350) and the slots (358) terminate distally at said arcuate 

end (356). 
An insertion member according to Claim 1 or 3, including locking 
means (100a,100b,149) for removably locking the member to an injection  

 
site. 
An insertion member according to Claim 4, wherein the locking 
means includes an elongate, deflectable arm (100a, 100b) engageable with 

an injection site. 
An insertion member according to Claim 5, wherein the locking 
means comprises a pair of said arms (100a,100b) each having an end 

region (100c) engageable with the injection site and a manually operable
