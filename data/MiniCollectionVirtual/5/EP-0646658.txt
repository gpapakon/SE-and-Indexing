<ABSTRACT>
To develop the invention, alloy layers that deposited 
on the surfaces of test samples were evaluated by 

performing a simulation with an experimental setup, in 
which a heater 1 held the interior of a furnace 8 at a 

predetermined temperature, a crucible 4 placed on a table 6 
on the bottom of the furnace 8 contained a molten zinc-aluminum 

alloy 5, a thermal sprayed sample 2 retained by a 
rotating shaft 9 was mounted rotatably in a soft iron 

cylinder 3 having a window 7. Aluminum is added to ceramics 
or cermets having high resistance to the erosive action of 

molten zinc alloys in such an amount that the aluminum 
content is 0.5 - 10 wt% in the as-sprayed composition. The 

powder thus prepared is thermal sprayed to form coatings on 
those members which are to be used submerged in the bath of 

a continuous hot-dip galvanizing process. The members with 
such thermal sprayed coatings are protected very 

effectively against the deposition of unwanted alloy 
layers. Also provided are the articles having such 

protective coatings formed thereon, as well the process for 
producing them and the method of hot-
dip galvanizing using 
those articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the development of a means 
that is effective in preventing the deposition of alloy 
layers on the surfaces of members, such as sunk rolls and 
Support rolls, that are used as submerged in zinc baths or 
zinc-aluminum alloy baths in facilities for the production 
of galvanized steel plates and sheets. More specifically, 
the invention relates to galvanizing bath members such as 
those to be submerged in galvanizing baths that have many 
chances to contact the molten zinc and which have coatings 
deposited on their surfaces by thermal spraying in order to 
impart not only high resistance to the erosive action of 
the molten zinc but also effective protection against the 
deposition of alloy layers. The invention also relates to a 
process for producing said galvanizing bath members, as 
well as a method of hot-dip galvanizing that uses said bath 
members. Galvanized steel plates and sheets have primarily been 
produced by continuous hot-dip galvanizing, in which a  
 
steel strip with cleaned surfaces is passed through a 
molten zinc alloy bath usually containing 0.1 - 0.2% 
aluminum, has the direction of its travel changed by a sunk 
(submerged) roll and passes by support rolls, wiping 
nozzles, etc. to be sent to a heating furnace, where 
alloying is effected and furnace-cooled to room 
temperature. During the passage of the steel strip through the 
aluminum-containing molten zinc alloy bath, the iron will 
dissolve out of the steel strip to be transferred into the 
molten zinc alloy, forming an Fe- and Al- supersaturated 
region in the liquid phase between the surfaces of the 
steel strip and the sunk roll. The metallic components 
precipitated out of this liquid phase supersaturated with 
Fe and Al nucleate on the surface of the sunk roll to have 
alloy layers deposited in solid phase, which is a 
phenomenon generally referred to as "dross formation". The solid-phase deposits of such alloy layers are hard 
and adhere to the sunk roll so tenaceously that they are 
deleterious to the surface quality of high-grade galvanized 
steel sheets such as those for use in automotive body 
parts. Therefore, preventing the alloy layers from being 
deposited on the surfaces of sunk rolls and support rolls 
is extremely important in the effort to improve the quality 
of galvanized steel plates or sheets.  
 With a view to preventing the deposition of unwanted 
alloy layers, it has been proposed that specified materials 
be thermal sprayed onto the surfaces of sunk rolls or 
support rolls.
