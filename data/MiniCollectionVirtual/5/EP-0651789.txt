<DESCRIPTION>
Post-herpetic neuralgia is the predominant
morbidity associated with development of herpes-zoster,
also known as shingles. The neuralgia
typically lasts for from one to six months and is
often excruciatingly painful.Evidence has accrued in recent years which
shows that herpes-zoster is caused by reactivation of
latent varicella virus [Straus etal., Ann. Int. Med.
(1988); 108, 221-237; Hyman etal., Lancet (1983) 2, 
814-816; Gilden etal., Nature (1983) 306, 478-80;
Croen etal., Proc. Nat1. Acad. Sci. USA (1988); 85,
9773-9777; Mahalingham etal., New Eng. J. Med.
(1990) 323, 627-631]. The initial varicella
infection may have occurred as a result of infantile
chickenpox or as a result of immunization with a
live-attenuated varicella zoster virus vaccine to
prevent chickenpox. In either case, the virus
appears to remain in the infected individual's system
long after chickenpox or vaccination. The locus of
VZV latency appears to be neural cells within dorsal
root ganglia.Years after VZV has become latent, the virus
reactivates by an as yet poorly understood
mechanism. Nonetheless, the reactivation of VZV and
its subsequent replication gives rise to herpes
zoster. It is in the course of and subsequent to
this reactivation of VZV that severe post-herpetic
neuralgia develops.Numerous reports in the literature have
suggested that there may be a correlation between
diminished immune competence and reactivation of
herpes zoster from its latent state. Suggestions of
the mechanism by which reactivation occurs include
diminished cell-based immunity, such as reduction of
the number of blood CD4+ receptor bearing
T-lymphocytes, which are responsible for recognizing
non-self antigens presented by MHC type II molecules
following phagocytosis of VZV. Alternatively, the
reduced levels of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, responsible for
killing cells in which MHC type I molecules recognize
and present non-self antigents, has also been 
suggested as a possible mechanism perimissive for VZV
reactivation. Neumeyer etal., [N.E.J. Med. p. 1456,
May 29, 1986) noted a drop in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+
prior to zoster, and subsequent increase of the ratio
upon termination of the clinical syndrome.In one study, a varicella vaccine was
adminsitered to elderly subjects in an attempt to
boost their CMI responses to VZV. VZV immunization
of these seropositive individuals was undertaken
because of the previously described age-related
decline in VZV-specific CMI [Miller AE., Neurology.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of varicella zoster virus (VZV) for the
manufacture of a vaccine for immunizing a person older than fifty who has

had varicella or who has had a live varicella vaccine, for reducing post-herpetic
neuralgia and for ameliorating or abrogating herpes zoster

reactivation.
The use of claim 1 where the vaccine is for reducing the
duration or severity of post-herpetic neuralgia.
The use of claim 1 or 2 where said VZV is the
attenuated Oka strain.
The use of claim 1, 2 or 3 where said immunizing is
done subcutaneously.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 4 where at least 1,000
plaque forming units (PFU) are used for such immunizing.
The use of claim 3 where the attenuated varicella
zoster virus Oka strain is stored in a lyophilized state before said

immunizing.
The use of claim 6 where the attenuated varicella
zoster virus Oka strain is reconstituted from the lyophilized state with

distilled water before immunizing.
