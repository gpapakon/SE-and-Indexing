A process for waterproofing materials having a fibrous structure, 
in particular leather and fur, by using sulfosuccinic acid 

monoesters, characterized in that leathers and furs are treated in 
aqueous float with water repellents comprising sulfosuccinic acid 

monoesters, without conducting a mineral salt fixation. 
The process according to claim 1 characterized in that water 
repel!ents are used which comprise as sulfosuccinic acid monoesters 

organosilicone di-(monosulfosuccinates) or which consist 
thereof. 
The process according to claim 1 and 2 characterized in that 
the succinates are used with neutral oils, such as mineral oil, paraffin, 

chlorinated paraffin, silicone oil, animal and/or vegetable fat 
and oil, or with their combinations. 
The process according to claim 1 - 3 characterized in that the 
use is effected in the main fatliquoring alone, or in a multistage 

manner in pre-, main, and top-fatliquoring. 
The process according to claims 1 - 4 characterized in that the 
sulfosuccinic acid esters used are produced by reaction of maleic 

anhydride with alcoholic components and subsequent sulfitation. 
The process according to claim 5 characterized in that monohydric 
or polyhydric alcohols having one or more alkyl residues of 

the chain length C
12-40
, preferably C
16-28
, and/or wool wax alcohols 
are used as alcoholic components. 
The process according to claims 5 or 6 characterized in that 
maleic anhydride is reacted with one or two equivalents of alcoholic 

component.  
 
The process according to claims 5 - 7 characterized in that alkoxylated 
fatty alcohols having EO and/or PO-portions of 1 - 10 

moles, preferably 2 - 5 moles, per mol of fatty alcohol are used as 
alcoholic component. 
The process according to claims 6 - 8 characterized in that co-emulsifiers 
are used prior to or during sulfitation of the maleic acid 

ester. 
The process according to claims 5 - 9 characterized in that the 
reaction of the maleic acid ester is effected with 0.5 - 1.5 equivalents 

of a sulfite or bisulfite. 
The process according to claims 1 - 10 characterized in that 
the sulfosuccinates are used in the form of their alkali, alkaline-earth, 

ammonium, or alkanolamine salts. 
Novel sulfosuccinic acid monoesters obtainable by reaction of 
α,ω-organofunctional polysiloxanes of the formula 


 
wherein n is a number from 10 to 30 and m represents 1 - 4, with 

maleic anhydride and subsequent sulfitation.
