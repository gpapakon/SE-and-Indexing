<ABSTRACT>
A solar absorber assembly (13) having upper and lower connectors (14, 15) between which tubes (16) extend for conveying water to be heated, the tubes (16) being surrounded by a glazing assembly (17) which is supported by the connectors (14, 15). The connectors (14, 15) may be connected with adjacent connectors (14, 15) of adjacent assemblies (13) to form a fence panel (11) which can be supported by posts (12), the fence panel (11) also serving as a security fence for swimming pools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solar absorber 
assemblies, for example, to solar absorber assemblies 
which may be incorporated in or comprise a fence or a 
fence panel. Solar absorbers of many different forms are 
currently available. In one form, such absorbers when 
applied to use in the heating of swimming pools, comprise 
multiple tubes which are arranged on an exposed surface 
and through which water may run or be pumped so as to be 
heated when the tubes are subject to radiation from the 
sun. Generally, such absorbers are formed of a flexible 
plastics material and arranged on the roof of a building. 
In most swimming pools installations, it is necessary to 
employ a security fence to prevent the access of 
unauthorized personnel or children to the pool. Such 
fences have now in many situations become obligatory even 
for existing pools. This results in considerable 
additional expense both to the pool owner with an existing 
pool and also to the cost of new pool installations. British Patent specification no. 2097114 
discloses a solar collection panel in which a series of 
parallel tubes are connected between a pair of spaced 
copper header pipes. A glazing panel hermetically seals 
in the tubes. Australian Patent specification no. AU 16164/83 
(556976) discloses the use of a swimming pool safety fence 
which also acts as a solar heater. The present invention aims to provide an 
improved solar absorber assembly. As will be described the solar assembly may be 
in the form of a fence panel for forming a fence which may 
serve as a security fence for swimming pools . The fence 
thus incorporates a solar absorber assembly for use in 
heating water of swimming pools or any other water supply.  
 According to the present invention there is 
provided a solar absorbed assembly including first and 
second end fittings adapted to be connected to 
corresponding end fittings of an adjacent said solar 
absorber assembly, at least one ducting member extending 
between said end fittings and connected in fluid 
communication therewith and glazing means surrounding said 
ducting member or members, and being supported between 
said first and second end fittings, characterised in that 
said glazing means, comprising a plurality of hollow 
glazing assemblies, each receiving said ducting member or 
members therethrough, each said glazing assembly including 
first and second parts, adapted to be releasably 
interconnected to surround said ducting member or members. Solar absorber assemblies embodying the 
invention will
