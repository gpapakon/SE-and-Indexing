<ABSTRACT>
A graphite-free lubricating oil which comprises a base oil 
having dispersed therein 10 to 40% by weight of a carbohydrate 

and/or a derivative thereof whose particle size ranges from 10 
to 150 µm, 2 to 20% by weight of a film-boosting agent and 0.1 

to 20% by weight of a dispersant. Moreover, the lubricating oil 
is free of black-colored substances such as graphite. 

Therefore, the oil permits the improvement of working 
surroundings and exhibits excellent properties such as 

formability through forging almost comparable to or even greater 
than that of the commercially available graphite-in-oil type 

lubricating oils. The lubricating oil can be used instead of the 
graphite-containing lubricating oils for warm forging, hot 

forging, rolling, tube-manufacturing, drawing and extrusion in 
place of the graphite-containing lubricating oils and ensures 

the improvement in the working surroundings and excellent 

lubricity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil which
is applied to the surface of a die during warm forging, hot
forging, rolling, tube-manufacturing, drawing or extruding a
material such as carbon steels, special steels or non-ferrous
metals and which can be substituted for the graphite-containing
lubricating oils and is effective for the improvement of working
surroundings.When the foregoing materials are subjected to various
processing such as warm forging, hot forging, rolling, tube-manufacturing,
drawing and extrusion, there have exclusively
been employed lubricating oils to be supplied to the surface of
a die during processing, which comprise graphite dispersed in
oils or water. The lubricating oils comprising graphite
dispersed in oils are excellent in lubricity, but have
insufficient abilities of cooling dies. On the other hand, the
lubricants comprising graphite dispersed in water have
excellent abilities of cooling dies, but is insufficient in
lubricity. For this reason, they are properly selected depending
on the process conditions and put into practical use. In
addition, either of these lubricants are black in appearance and
correspondingly, suffer from a problem of dirt of working
surroundings. In JP-A-54-143409 it has been disclosed a lubricant for hot
rolling for steels comprising a base oil, calcium carbonate and a
water-soluble high polymer capable of increasing liquid viscosity and
forming protective colloid. However in the absence of a dispersant the
lubricant does not exhibit simultaneously excellent formability,
sprayability, elimination of dirt of die set and self-extinguishing property. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a novel lubricating oil which does not cause dirt of
working surroundings during various processings requiring good
lubricity such as warm forging, hot forging, rolling, tube-manufacturing,
drawing and extrusion unlike the conventional
graphite-in-oil type lubricating-oils and which has lubricity
comparable to or rather superior to either of the foregoing
lubricating oils and permits the extension of service life of
machinery and tools to which the oil is applied.The inventors of this invention have conducted various
studies to solve the foregoing drawbacks associated with the
conventional graphite-based lubricating oils and to develop a
novel lubricating oil free of such drawbacks, have found out
that the foregoing object of the present invention can
effectively be accomplished through the use of a combination of
a carbohydrate
