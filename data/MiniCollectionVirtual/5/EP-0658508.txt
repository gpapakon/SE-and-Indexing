<ABSTRACT>
In this buffer-stops system according to the invention for lifts, energy-dissipating, deformable bodies 13 of honeycomb structure are used as one-way buffers. The deformable bodies 13 replace the conventional oil and spring buffers and are inserted into a casing tube 14 on the shaft bottom 10, are placed on a pedestal or are set up freely. In the event of a collision of the lift car 1, the deformable bodies 13 are compressed by means of the pressure rams 12 under the lift car 1 or by means of other parts of the car construction, the kinetic energy of an overrunning and colliding lift car 1 being dissipated by work of deformation in the deformable body 13. By appropriate choice of material, honeycomb type, shaping and cross-sectional area of the deformable body 13, the requisite, reproducible force-displacement characteristics can be realised. The buffer-stops system according to the invention can also be used for self-propelled lifts by these lifts having one energy-dissipating, deformable body 13 each mounted as collision protection below and above the car.
