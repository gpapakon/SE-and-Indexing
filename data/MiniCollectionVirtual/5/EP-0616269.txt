<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing apparatus 
applied to the development of a latent image formed on an 
image forming body used for an electrophotographic image 
forming apparatus. Compared with 1-component-developer composed of magnetic 
toner without using magnetic carrier, 2-component-developer, 
in which toner and magnetic carrier are mixed, is advantageous 
in that: the toner can be easily subjected to triboelectric 
charging control; and the toner is seldom coagulated. 
Therefore, when 2-component-developer is used, toner transfer 
can be effectively controlled by a development electric field. 
Accordingly, in the case where a color image is developed by 
color toner, high image quality can be provided. 
Consequently, 2-component-developer is frequently used 
although the quantity of toner with respect to carrier must be 
controlled.  The 2-component-developer is applied to the following 
developing apparatus: a developing apparatus in which a 
developing sleeve is fixed, and a magnet, in which a plurality 
of N and S poles are circumferentially disposed, is rotated in 
the developing sleeve; a developing apparatus in which a 
developing sleeve and a magnet are rotated together; and a 
developing apparatus in which a developing sleeve is rotated, 
and the poles of a magnet provided in the developing sleeve 
are fixed. In the case of a developing apparatus in which the 
magnet provided in the developing sleeve is rotated, high 
torque must be given to the magnet because it is rotated at 
high speed. Therefore, vibrations are caused, and the 
rotational mechanism is complicated, and further it must be 
made strong and large. For this reason, a developing 
apparatus is widely used, in which a developing sleeve is 
rotated, and the poles of a magnet provided in the developing 
sleeve are fixed. In the developing apparatus described 
above, developer is deposited onto the surface of the 
developing sleeve by the action of the magnet provided in the 
developing sleeve, and when the developing sleeve is rotated, 
the developer is conveyed to a developing region disposed at 
the closest position to an image forming body on which a 
latent image is formed. In this way, the latent image is 
developed. When the latent image on the image forming body is 
developed, two methods are applied. One is a contact  
 
developing method by which development is conducted when a 
developer layer formed on the developing sleeve rubs the 
surface of the image forming body. The other is a non-contact 
developing
