<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cordlock (3) for a vertically 
displaceable window covering comprising: 


a locking body (11) provided with a clamping member (14), and 
a housing (5) accommodating the locking body and having a 
counter clamping member (10) forming part thereof and co-acting 

with the clamping member, and an inlet and 
outlet for passage of the cord, 
 
wherein the housing encloses the locking body such that it is 

displaceable between a clamping position and a release 
position, wherein the locking body is also provided with a 

guide (12) which is connected to the clamping member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cordlock for a
vertically displaceable window covering.Existing cordlock systems have the drawback
that when the lock is set into operation the window
covering drops downward a determined distance before
locking of the cord takes place. This property is
undesirable since the locked situation of the window
covering is hereby difficult to determine exactly. This
dropping back of the window covering is particularly
undesirable in the fully opened position because of the
increase in the height of the lifted components.In US-A-2.674.350 a cordlock is disclosed
comprising:
a locking body provided with a clamping
member for clamping said cord in a clamping position and
provided with a guide for guiding said cord, said guide
being connected to the clamping member; and a housing accommodating the locking body and
having a counter clamping member forming part thereof for
co-action with the clamping member, said housing being
provided with an inlet, and an outlet for passage of the
cords.  It is an object of the present invention to
provide an improved cordlock of the above stated type
with which dropping back of the window covering after
activation of the lock is reduced to a minimum. The
present invention has the further object of providing a
cordlock which functions in operationally certain manner,
is simple to install and replace and which can also be
used in different positions. The present invention provides a cordlock for
locking one or more cords of a vertically displaceable
window covering, comprising:
a locking body provided with a clamping
member for clamping said cord in a clamping position and
provided with a guide for guiding said cord, said guide
being connected to the clamping member; anda housing accommodating the locking body and
having a counter clamping member forming part thereof for
co-action with the clamping member, said housing being
provided with an inlet, and an outlet for passage of the
cords, characterized in that said locking body is
enclosed in and lies unattached within the housing body,
such that it is freely displaceable along a contact
surface between a release position wherein the cords are
unlocked and a locking position wherein the cord is
clamped between the clamping member and the counter
clamping member.The cordlock according to the present invention
comprises a small number of moving parts, is therefore
relatively simple to assemble and relatively inexpensive
to manufacture.
Further it is an advantage that when a window
covering is pulled up
