<ABSTRACT>
A bleach composition comprises an active halogen or a 
peroxy bleach material, preferably hypochlorite; 

surfactant constituted by at least 50% w/w primary alkyl 
sulphate; and polymeric thickener comprising charged, 

hydrophilic monomer and uncharged hydrophobic monomer. 
The polymeric thickener preferably comprises a copolymer 

of methacrylic acid and styrene having proportions (wt%) 
of methacrylic acid and styrene ranging from 80:20 to 

20:80, and preferably comprises 54 wt% methacrylic acid 
and 46% styrene, with a molecular weight of about 100,00 

and substantially no cross-linking. The polymeric 
thickener acts to enhance thickening and enables use of a 

wider range of surfactants than hitherto possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns bleach compositions, particularly 
thickened aqueous bleach compositions. There is much prior art concerning thickened aqueous 
bleach compositions, using a variety of thickening agents. 
See, for example, EP 0256638 (Clorox), EP 0373864 
(Procter & Gamble) and EP 0329419 (Unilever) and the prior 
art referred to in those documents. According to the present invention there is provided a 
bleach composition, comprising an active halogen or a 
peroxy bleach material; surfactant; and polymeric 
thickener comprising charged, hydrophilic monomer and 
uncharged, hydrophobic monomer, said surfactant comprising 
at leat 50% w/w primary alkyl sulphate. The charged, hydrophilic monomer is preferably selected 
from group: acrylic acid and substituted acrylic acids, 
eg. methacyrlic acid, maleic acid and half-esters 
thereof, crotonic and itaconic acids and other alkene 
carboxylic acids and their derivatives, carboxylated  
 
styrene, sulphonated styrene, ethylene sulphonic acid, and 
certain nitrogen-based monomers eg acrylamide, vinyl 
pyrollidone, and mixtures of such hydrophilic monomers. The uncharged hydrophobic monomer is preferably selected 
from the group: styrene and substituted styrenes eg. 
alpha-methyl styrene, alpha-olefins, eg. C₁₂-alpha-olefin, 
vinyl ethers, eg. butyl vinyl ether; allyl ethers, eg. 
butyl allyl ether; unsaturated hydrocarbons, eg ethylene, 
propylene, cyclohexene and dienes, eg. 1,6 hexadiene, 
divinyl benzene, cyclohexadiene. Such hydrophobic 
moieties may also be introduced into the polymer by chain 
transfer agents and initiators, eg. mercaptans, eg. 
dodecyl mercaptans, and peroxides and azo initiators, eg. 
dilauryl peroxide, AZBN (azoiso butyronitrile). Mixtures 
hydrophobic monomers may also be used. A single monomer with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
properties may also be used. The preferred polymer comprises a copolymer of methacyrlic 
acid and styrene, conveniently having proportions (wt %) 
of methacrylic acid and styrene ranging from 80:20 to 
20:80. Additional monomers, such as acrylic esters, acrylates, 
olefins and substituted styrenes, may optionally be 
included, eg in place of up to about half of the amount of 
styrene. The polymer is preferably substantially non cross-linked, 
for reasons that will be explained below, although a 
degree of cross-linking can be tolerated.  The polymer preferably has a molecular weight of about 
100,000, although this is not critical and indeed it can 
be difficult to produce a polymer having an
