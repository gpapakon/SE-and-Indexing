<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a complex fiber string used as a tension member of a PC structure. The characteristics 
of the present invention reside in that it provides a complex fiber string having a high mechanical strength and produced 

by heating a thermosetting resin-impregnated fiber core so as to put the thermosetting resin in a semi-hardened state, 
subjecting the outer circumferential surface of the fiber core to primary wrapping and secondary wrapping with bundled 

fiber yarn, intertwining a plurality of fiber cores thus obtained, and then heating the intertwined fiber cores so as to 
harden the semi-hardened thermosetting resin. Another characteristic of the present invention reside in that the bundled 

fiber yarn for the primary or secondary wrapping of the fiber core is wound therearound in a spaced manner so as to 
form helical ridges and grooves on the outer circumferential surface of the fiber core, whereby the bonding strength 

required by a final product as a tension member with respect to a material to which the tension member is to be 
applied is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fibrous composite rope for use in 
prestressing members of PC (prestressed concrete) structures in the civil 
engineering and construction industry or strengthening or reinforcing members 
for power or communication cables, etc., and more particularly to such a fibrous 
rope which is obtained by stranding a plurality of fibrous cores or strands 
impregnated with a thermosetting resin. The "rope" herein referred to is a 
generic term including in its meaning all ropes, cords and the like stranded 
materials. Heretofore, an overwhelmingly major part of prestressing members for PC 
structures has been shared by steel in the civil engineering and construction 
industry. Many improvements have been proposed in such steel-based structural 
prestressing members, among which Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 3-28,551 
typically discloses one of the most advanced one. Namely, it discloses a 
prestressing member featuring a high corrosion resistance, good anchorage and 
workability due to its synthetic resin coating. However, since such a prestressing member comprises stranded steel wires 
as its base material, it is heavy in weight and cannot be free from problems 
caused by magnetism, and if its resin coating is damaged the stranded wires 
will corrode, resulting in the loss of required mechanical properties. Meanwhile, there are known various cords and ropes fabricated of fibers 
or fibrous yarns. Among those, the fibrous composite ropes disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 62-18,679 is known as having a high tensile 
strength. The disclosed fibrous composite rope is obtained by impregnating a 
fiber core with a thermosetting resin, covering the outer periphery of the  
 
impregnated core with a fiber braid after applying drying powder onto the 
periphery, and subsequently heating the covered core to cure the thermosetting 
resin. In the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication cited 
immediately above, in which drying powder is used to prevent the thermosetting 
resin impregnated into the fiber core from leaking therefrom, the drying powder 
must be applied uniformly in a well controlled quantity, thus rendering the 
process or production control difficult. If such leakage of the thermosetting 
resin cannot be prevented, the leaked thermosetting resin will cause such fiber 
cores to be adhesively bonded to each other when they are brought together in a 
later stranding or twisting process, consequently to suppress their relative 
movements, resulting
