<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for forming a plurality of reagent spheres comprising reagents for analyzing a biological sample and being capable of completely dissolving in an aqueous solution, as well reagent spheres made according to this method, and further a method for optically analyzing a biological fluid under use of said reagent sphere.In preparing reagents for convenient and efficient testing of clinical biological samples, it is frequently important to obtain dry chemical blends in uniform, discrete amounts. These reagents must be efficiently and economically prepared in small precisely measured quantities. Reagents comprising organic materials, however, tend to spoil or degrade on storage, thus creating quality control problems. Thus, reagents are typically provided in dried form to increase stability. Current technology for producing dry chemical blends involves procedures such as dry blending, spray drying, or fluid bed drying. All three of these procedures, however, have limitations that make them costly, inefficient or difficult to carry out.In dry blending technology, it is difficult to obtain homogeneous blends of chemicals that have different densities. Moreover, homogeneity is particularly difficult to achieve when very small amounts of ingredients are mixed with large amounts of others. Once made homogeneous, it is extremely difficult to reproducibly (within 1 percent) dispense small amounts (less than about 10 mg) of the blended chemicals.Spray drying technology provides more homogenous blends of chemicals because the reagents are first dissolved in liquid. Using spray drying, however, it is difficult and costly to obtain precisely sized amounts of blended chemicals. As generally practiced, this process yields particles with size distributions having coefficients of variation greater than 20 percent. The resulting particles have to be reprocessed (usually agglomerated) to obtain uniform particle sizes. After agglomeration, the particles are generally less soluble than the original spray dried particles. Moreover, these procedures typically use fluorocarbon cryogenic solutions which are hazardous to the environment.Fluid bed technology relies upon spraying a liquid reagent blend onto a particle and drying the liquid to obtain a particle coated with the blended reagents. Using this procedure, it is difficult to obtain uniformly sized particles and to produce a uniform coating.Of particular interest to the present invention are reagents useful in analyzing biological samples, such

A method for forming a plurality of reagent spheres comprising reagents for analyzing a biological sample and being capable of completely dissolving in an aqueous solution, the method comprising the steps:

forming an aqueous homogenous solution of the reagents;
dispensing individual uniform, precisely measured drops of the aqueous solution of a volume between about 2.5 µl and about 4.0 µl into a non-agitated cryogenic liquid, whereby the drops are frozen;
and lyophilizing the drops, thereby forming reagent spheres having a coefficient of weight variation less than about 3%.
A plurality of substantially uniform, precisely measured reagent spheres made in accordance with claim 1, the spheres being capable of completely dissolving in less than 10 seconds in an aqueous solution.
A plurality of substantially uniform, precisely measured reagent spheres made in accordance with claim 1, the spheres being capable of completely dissolving in less than about 10 seconds in an aqueous solution, the reagent spheres comprising reagents necessary for the analysis of a biological sample, a surfactant at a concentration sufficient to inhibit bubble formation when the spheres dissolve and a filler in a concentration sufficient to facilitate the formation of a chemical lattice capable of conducting the solution into the reagent spheres.
A reagent sphere of claim 3 capable of completely dissolving in less than about 20 µl of solution.
A method for optically analyzing a biological fluid, the method comprising:

delivering a predetermined volume of the biological fluid to a test well containing a reagent sphere of the plurality of spheres according to claim 2, 3 or 4, and comprising the reagents for the analysis of the sample, whereby the reagent sphere completely dissolves in the fluid:

passing a light beam through the fluid in the test well; and
detecting the light beam after it has passed through the fluid.
