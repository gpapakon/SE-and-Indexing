<ABSTRACT>
An electronic image processing system (10) 
comprises a scanner (11) in which a light source (12) is 

provided to illuminate an image captured on a film (13). 
A charge-coupled device (14) produces digital data 

defining a multiplicity of picture elements which 
together represent the image. A look up table (15) 

converts the data from the CCD into a format suitable 
for processing by a processor (17) which data is stored 

in a framestore (16). The data in the framestore is 
read and processed by the processor (17) and output for 

display of the image on a monitor (19). Characteristics 
or attributes of the displayed image are adjusted by the 

processor in response to user manipulation of a stylus 
and touch tablet device (18). Once the user is 

satisfied with the image as displayed the adjustment is 
used to alter the manner in which the scanner and look 

up table operate so that a further scanning of the image 
will provide data in the framestore representing the 

image with characteristics or attributes similar to 
those in the previously displayed image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for and a
method of image processing. Particularly, but not
exclusively, the invention relates to an electronic
apparatus for and method of processing digital data
representing an image captured on an image medium.The faithful capturing of an image on an image
capture medium such as negative or reversal film is a
complex issue. Film emulsion is responsive to the
logarithm of the amount of light falling on the
emulsion. That is to say, the response of the
emulsion varies with variations in the intensity of
light to which the emulsion is exposed and with
changes in time for which the emulsion is exposed to
light, and in a developed negative the density of the
emulsion is proportional to the log of the exposure.
The manner in which an emulsion responds to exposure
can be plotted in a graph of emulsion density against
the log of the exposure and the plot thus produced is
known as the characteristic curve of the film.An exemplary characteristic curve 1 of a negative
film is shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings
and an exemplary characteristic curve 2 of a reversal
film (for which density is inversely proportional to
the log of light intensity) is shown in Figure 2 of
the accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 1 the 
characteristic curve 1 for negative film has a minimum
density value Dmin which is not equal to zero because
the film substrate is not perfectly clear and because
of a slight fogging of the emulsion unavoidably caused
by the developer in the developing process. At low
exposures small changes in exposure are not enough to
change the density of the emulsion. The slope of the
curve gradually increases until at a point 3 the path
of the curve follows a substantially straight line 4.
At the other end of the curve after the point 5 the
slope again levels off and further increases in
exposure have no further effect on the density of the
emulsion because the emulsion has reacted completely
to the light and no further change is possible. It
follows that film emulsion has a useful exposure range
which is limited at one end by a minimum useful
exposure 6 and at the other end by a maximum useful
exposure 7. The minimum useful exposure is the
exposure where a measurable density above the fog
level is produced and where the slope of the curve is
sufficiently steep for a slight change in light level
to be distinguishable. The maximum useful exposure is
similarly defined.The characteristic curve for reversal film in
Figure 2 of the drawings shows that reversal
