<ABSTRACT>
A liquid preparation of a pharmaceutically active agent having a defined composition is repeatedly dosed from a multi-dose container having a defined volume. The amount dosed is selected as 1/N of the volume of the multi-dose container, N being an integer having a value of 2 or higher. A device for dosing a liquid preparation comprises a holder (1) for a multi-dose container (2), which has a movable rear wall (5) acting as a piston for expelling the liquid preparation (6) from the container, and a piston rod (7), which is provided with releasable blocking means (11, 14, 19, 22), such that the movement of the piston rod is limited to a preset length (35) corresponding to an expelled volume of 1/N of the volume of said multi-dose container, N being an integer having a value of 2 or higher. A preferred embodiment of the device is as an injection device for repeated parenteral injections from an injection cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the dosing of
liquid preparations. More specifically, the invention
refers to a method for the repeated dosing
of liquid pharmaceutical preparations which are to be
administered. Still more specifically, the invention
refers to a method for the repeated dosing
and administering of liquid pharmaceutical preparations
by parenteral injection from a multi-dose container.
Furthermore, the invention also refers to a device for
carrying out the method of the invention, especially
then in the form of an injection device for repeatedly
administering parenteral injections from an injection
cartridge.When a pharmaceutical agent is prescribed by a
physician, the amount or dose to be administered to the
patient is usually expressed in well-known units, such
as milliliters or international units (IU). The dose is
determined by such factors as the health status and
weight of the patient, for example, and by rules from
the health authorities. In those cases where the
patient himself is to administer the doses, the
physician then selects a suitable multi-dose container,
from which a number of doses may be administered. Such
a multi-dose container may be a vial, from which each
individual dose is withdrawn by means of a hypodermic
syringe, or it may be in the form of an injection cartridge,
which is to be inserted in an injection device
for repeated administrations. Injection cartridges have
found a wide use because of the easiness in their handling
and the diminished risk of infections, especially
when the patient has to give himself repeated administrations.
Injection devices in the shape of a pen for
repeated injections of such preparations as, for
example, insulin and growth hormones are commercially
available. The user inserts an injection cartridge in 
the device and attaches an injection needle to the
cartridge, and the device is then ready for repeated
injections. The device may be set at different doses
and is usually graduated in such units as milliliters
or International Units.Known devices of this kind are disclosed in WO 88/07874 and EP 378 305, the latter taken
as the basis for the improvements of the invention, both descibing threaded piston rods and a
dose setting mechanism wherein a part is rotated to free the piston rod for forward motion.
With these devices dose setting has to be repeated before each injection operation and the devices
are not suited for repeated injections with doses of equal size. It is usually desirable that the dose is set in such
a way that

<CLAIMS>
A method for the repeated dosing of a liquid preparation of a pharmaceutically active agent
to provide unchanged but repeated determined doses of the pharmaceutically active agent by

expulsion from a multi-dose container (2) having a defined volume, said container having a
fix
ed front wall (3) through which is arranged an outlet (4) for the preparation (6) and a rear
movable wall (5) acting as a piston for expelling said preparation through said outlet by

means of the movement of a piston rod (7) connected to a dosing mechanism, 
characterized
in that
 it comprises the steps of

a) selecting a combination of (i) a concentration of the pharmaceuticlly active agent in the
liquid preparation contained in the multi-dose container and (ii) a partial volume of said

liquid preparation, which partial volume is 1/N of said defined volume of the multi-dose
container, N being an integer having a value of 2 or higher, the combination of (i) and (ii)

giving said determined dose,
b) connecting a multi-dose container (2), containing the defined volume of liquid preparation
of said concentration, to the piston rod (7) and dosing mechanism, and
c) performing exactly N individual and successive expulsion strokes with the piston rod,
