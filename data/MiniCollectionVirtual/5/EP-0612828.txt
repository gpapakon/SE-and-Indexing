<ABSTRACT>
An economic and safe process includes a catalytic cracking 
of the rubber tires and rubber products in the presence of mica 

catalyst selected from the group consisting of muscovite, 
sericite and biotite at a reaction temperature of 230 - 400° C 

under a pressure of 1 - 2.5 atmospheres for forming mixed oils, 
carbon black, gaseous products, and other residual products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for cracking
waste rubber tires.Conventional waste tires may be crushed or pulverized for
producing reclaimed rubber which is used in limited proportions
as an extender to lower the cost of rubber products. It may be
somewhat deleterious to the final physical properties of the
rubber product, but it aids in the processing because it flows
and extrudes readily. However, the reclaimed rubber generally
accounts for a low percentage such as about 10% of rubber
consumption in the United States. For environmental protection,
it is necessary to treat the waste rubber tires not used in the
above-mentioned reclaiming processes.Several conventional cracking processes are therefore
applied for treating the rapidly growing waste rubber tires for
producing fuel oils and gases by cracking the waste rubber tires,
of which a conventional process discloses a cracking reaction
conducted at a high temperature of more than 1000°C under a high
pressure of 3 - 30 kilograms per square-centimeter. However,
such a conventional cracking process for cracking waste rubber
products at high temperature and pressure may have the following
drawbacks:
1. A high initial cost is required for installing the high
pressure vessel at higher reaction temperature.2. Since many flammable gaseous products, such as: hydrogen,
low-carbon hydrocarbon gases including methane, ethane, propane,
butane, isobutane, butene, etc., may be produced during the 
cracking process, such flammable gases produced from the high
temperature, high pressure reactor will be very dangerous or
hazardous to the working environment in view of industrial safety
factor. For instance, the hydrogen gas has an ignition
temperature of 1085°F (585°C); methane of 999°F (537°C); ethane
of 959 °F (515°C), etc. They are all flammable, or easily
explosive once leaked from the high-temperature cracking reactor
and should be handled or treated very carefully, thereby
increasing operation complexity and cost therefore.3. It will consume much energy to conduct the cracking
reaction at higher temperature, thereby wasting valuable energy
resources.Therefore, the present inventor invents a process for
cracking waste rubber tires at lower temperature and pressure for
overcoming the drawbacks of conventional cracking processes.According to the present invention, there is provided an
economic and safe process for cracking waste rubber tires and
rubber products by catalytic cracking of the rubber tires and
rubber products in the presence of a mica

<CLAIMS>
A process for cracking waste rubber tires comprising:

a. washing and crushing waste rubber tires into rubber
scraps;
b. mixing the rubber scraps with a catalyst of sericite
under preheating to 210°C;
c. performing a cracking reaction with destructive
distillation of the rubber scraps in the presence of the catalyst

of sericite comprising a catalyst quantity of 2 - 3% by weight
based on 100% of total waste rubber tires fed in the cracking

reaction under heating to maintain a temperature ranging from 230°C
to 400°C under a pressure of 1 atmosphere to 2.5 atmospheres

for one hour to produce cracking products of vapor-phase products
containing gases and mixed oils, and solid products containing

carbon black and residual products; and
d. separating the cracking products into gases, mixed oils,
carbon black and residual products.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein said mica
catalyst is a sericite powder.
