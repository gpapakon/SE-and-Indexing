<ABSTRACT>
A device is proposed which serves to wipe windows on motor vehicles. The wiping device comprises a wiper arm (12) which can move over the window and at one free end (14) of which, which end (14) is bent in a hook-shape, a wiper blade (16) is held which is rested on the window with a wiper strip and which has an articulation bolt (20) around which the hook end (14) of the wiper arm (12) engages, said articulation bolt (20) connecting two wiper-blade holder cheeks (22, 24) which are arranged at a distance from one another and parallel to one another, and on which articulation bolt (20) a plastic adaptor (28), arranged between the holder cheeks (22, 24), is coupled in order to connect the hook end of the wiper arm, which plastic adaptor (28) has a receptacle for securing the hook end. The adaptor (28) can be used for wiper arms with different hook widths and permits easy handling if the receptacle is constructed as a reception channel (39) which is open to one holder cheek and whose shape follows the curvature of the hook, and if means for reducing the depth (34) of the channel at least over certain sections are also arranged on the adaptor (28).

Wiping device for windows of motor vehicles, with 
a wiper arm (12) which can be moved across the window and 

on one, free end (14) of which, which is bent in the 
shape of a hook, there is held a wiper blade (16) which 

is laid on the window by means of the wiper strip and has 
a hinge pin (20) around which the hook end of the wiper 

arm engages, which connects two mutually parallel wiper-blade 
frame side pieces arranged at a distance from one 

another and on which there is hinged a plastic adapter 
(28) which is arranged between the frame side pieces (22, 

24), is intended for the connection of the hook end of 
the wiper arm and has a receptacle for holding fast the 

hook end, characterized in that the receptacle is 
designed as a receiving channel (30), the shape of which 

follows the curvature (14) of the hook and which is open 
towards one frame side piece (24), and in that means (64, 

66) for reducing the channel depth (34) at least in some 
sections are arranged on the adapter (28). 
Wiping device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the means are formed by shims (64, 66) that can 

be laid on the channel bottom (62). 
Wiping device according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the shims (64, 66) are connected integrally to 

the adapter (28) by film hinges (68, 70). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the channel depth (34) is smaller 

than the width (35) of the hook end (14), in that 
elastically deflectable latching hooks (38) arranged on 

at least one channel edge fit at least partially over the 
channel (30) and in that the usable channel depth plus  

 
the effective length of the latching hooks (38) is 

adapted to the width (36) of the hook end (14). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the channel depth is matched to the 

width (35) of the hook end (14) to be received. 
Wiping device according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that matching is carried out with the aid of the shims 

(64 and 66). 
Wiping device according to either of Claims 4 and 
5, characterized in that at least one of the channel 

walls (36) has elastically deflectable latching hooks 
(38) which are cut free from the latter and fit at least 

partially over the channel (30) and in that the usable 
channel depth is adapted to the width (35) of the hook 

end (14). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the receiving channel (30) has a 

partial pocket-like widened portion (42). 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
and Claim 8, characterized in that a lid-like cover for 

closing the lateral receiving-channel opening is 
connected to the adapter (28), preferably by a film 

hinge. 
Wiping device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the adapter is curved in the form 

of a hair pin, the curvature following the shape of the 
channel (30), and in that a socket (44) for the hinge pin 

(20) is arranged between the adapter limbs (48, 50) thus 
formed.
