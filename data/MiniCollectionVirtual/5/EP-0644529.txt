<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic memory device
wherein the scanning of a magnetic memory medium surface is
performed without contact with the surface, by the use of
a scanning tunnelling microscope technique.The technology of the scanning probe microscope,
referred to hereinafter as SPM, has been rapidly developing
recently, and attempts have been made to provide a magnetic
recording device using this technology. A magnetic force
microscope, referred to hereinafter as MFM, has achieved a
resolution in the nanometre range, as reported in JOURNAL
OF THE MAGNETICS SOCIETY OF JAPAN (vol. 16, No. 3, 1992 p.
532-540) by Ookubo, et al., or as disclosed in Japanese
Provisional Patent Publication HEI 05-073850, by MIZOSHITA
et al.The method disclosed there is as follows. Recording
of data into a magnetic domain is performed by applying an
electric current to an exciting coil while the tip of a
sharp magnetic probe is kept in contact with a surface of
the recording medium. Reading of the thus-perpendicularly
recorded data from the magnetic domain is performed by
detecting a change, caused from the magnetic field of the 
perpendicular magnetization bit domain, in an envelope of
the amplitude of a signal picked up with the MFM probe by
scanning this MFM probe while the MFM probe is vibrated.
This detection method is an application of a non-contact
Atomic Force Microscope, which is a variant of the above-mentioned
technology, to the detection of magnetic force,
i.e. the gradient.In prior-proposed detection methods employing the
MFM, the roughness of the surface of the recording medium
is undesirably detected as a change in magnetic force,
and consequently produces noise mixed in with the
detected signal. It has been difficult to separate the
reproduced information properly from the noise.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 32, No. 8A,
January 1990, pages 362-363 relates to a structure
providing a magnetic flux return path for a high density
vertical recording system. It discloses a magnetic
memory device according to the preamble of accompanying
claim 1, in which a write coil is provided around the
probe to carry a write current. This coil may also act
as a magnetic flux detecting element; however, no reading
operation using this magnetic flux is disclosed.US-A-5 212 680 discloses a mass storage device
having a substrate storing data bits and an array of
transducers which is moved relative to the substrate by a
scan mechanism. No details are given of the transducers
but the preferred form of the device is an
