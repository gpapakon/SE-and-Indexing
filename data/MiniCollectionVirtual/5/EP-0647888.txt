<ABSTRACT>
An original transporting device for transporting 
an original to an exposure unit of a copying machine 

includes a loading tray for loading the originals, 
a first separation unit for separating one original on 

the bottom of the originals loaded on the loading tray 
from the first side of the loading means, a first 

transporting unit for transporting the original 
separated by the first separation unit along a first 

transporting passageway, a second separation unit for 
separating one original on the bottom of the originals 

loaded on the loading tray from the second side of the 
loading tray, a second transporting unit for transporting 

the original separated by the second separation unit 
along a second transporting passageway, a third 

transporting unit for transporting the original 
transported by the first transporting unit in a first 

direction, stopped it at the exposure unit for a while, 
then transporting it in a second direction, and 

transporting the original transported by the second 
transporting unit in the second direction to pass through 

the exposure unit, and ejection means for ejecting the 
original transported by the third transporting unit 

from the exposure unit in the second direction on to the 
loading tray, wherein the transporting speed of the second 

transporting unit is higher than the transporting speed 
of the third transporting unit in the second direction,  

 
whereby the original interval between the previous 

original and the current original which has been apart 
in separating the original can be rendered closer to 

accord to the maximum ability of the copying machine so 
that the maximum productivity can be attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original
transporting device capable of effecting exposure while
transporting the original.Fig. 33 is a cross-sectional view of the essence
showing an example of such a sheet transporting device (as known from e.g. US-A-4 860 057).In the figure, 1001 is a sheet transporting
device main body, disposed at a predetermined position
on the top portion of an image processing apparatus.
1002 is a platen glass, 1003 is a transporting belt for
transporting the original in an E or D direction by
driving a transporting roller 1007. 1004 is an
original tray on which the original bundle P is laid.
1005 is a half-moon shaped feeding roller for separating
an original on the bottom of the original bundle P laid
on the original tray 1004 and delivering it into a
transporting passageway.1006 is an original feeding belt for transporting
the original sheet (sheet member), in corporation with
the feeding roller 1008, delivered from the original
tray 1004 via the transporting passageway toward a
direction where the platen glass 1002 is arranged. 
1009 is an original exposure portion, scanned at a
predetermined speed in an A direction, for leading a
reflected image of the original laid on the platen glass
1002 into an imaging system (not shown). 1010 is a
large transporting roller which rotates in a forward or
reverse direction to turn over the original, or eject
the original. 1011 is a paper ejection roller which
serves to load the original which has been read on to
the original tray 1004 again.In a device thus constructed, the sheet member
from the original tray 1004 is transported from the B
end side of the platen glass 1002 into an image reading
position, where the sheet is placed in an arbitrary
disposition, after which the original exposure portion
1009 of the sheet transporting device main body 1001 is
moved in the A direction to read the original, and after
completion of reading, the sheet member is ejected from
the B end side of the platen glass 1002 and loaded again
onto the original tray 1004.In contrast to an original fixed reading mode,
another reading mode referred to as an original flow
reading mode has been proposed in which, with the
original exposure portion 1009 of the image forming
device fixed, the sheet member is transported from the
C end side into the other end in the figure to read the
original, in order to effect fast image formation
without high speed transportation. However, in the original flow reading mode, there
was a problem that in reading the original
