<ABSTRACT>
The present disclosure is directed to methods and apparatus for 
conducting gas chromatography more rapidly than previously disclosed. By 

means of the present disclosure the time necessary to conduct a gas 
chromatographic analysis can be reduced by more than 50%. The methods 

and apparatus employed reduce system dead volumes to prevent band 
broadening and mixing of the sample components as the gas sample is 

analyzed. The present disclosure also relates to the apparatus described 
above as applied to controlling chemical, refining, and other processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
conducting gas chromatography. More particularly, this invention 
relates to apparatus and methods which decrease the time necessary to 
conduct the analysis and the application of this technology to control 
chemical, refining and other processes. Gas chromatography (GC) is a widely employed 
technique used for the separation and analysis of mixtures of volatile 
and semi-volatile organic and inorganic mixtures. The mixture is 
separated into its components by eluting them from a column by 
means of a moving gas. The moving gas flows through the 
chromatographic column in which the various components separate 
from one another depending on their vapor pressures and interactions 
with the stationary phase within the chromatographic column. The 
stationary phase is commonly a thin layer of a nonvolatile liquid or an 
adsorbent solid. The concentration of the various eluted components 
are then measured via a detector at the end of the column. The 
detector generates an electrical signal, which in conjunction with 
appropriate electronics, produces peaks at various times. Proper 
analysis of the peaks allows one with skill in the art to determine both 
the identity and amount of the components in the sample. Although gas chromatography is widely used today and 
provides excellent performance, efforts are continuing to optimize the 
performance of gas chromatographs. Along these lines efforts have 
been made to reduce the time necessary to complete gas 
chromatographic analyses. Usually the detection step is quite rapid, 
with the analysis time determined by the efficiencies of the separation 
column and the sample inlet system.  The commercial availability of high efficiency open-tubular 
capillary columns for GC has made possible very high 
resolution separations by using very long columns with very small 
inner diameters, Danddeneau, R.D., and Zerenner, E.H., High 
Resolution Chromatography & Chromatography Communications, 2, 
351-356 (1979). U.S. Patent 5,096,471 (Sacks et al.) discloses the use of a 
vacuum pump in order to reduce the time necessary to perform the 
analysis. The vacuum pump causes backflushing of a short column 
after components of interest have been eluted, but before higher 
boiling components have been eluted thereby shortening the time 
required for analysis. U.S. Patent 4,923,486 (Rubey) discloses a time-programmable 
curvilinearly shaped negative temperature gradient 
along the length of the chromatographic column. The gas
