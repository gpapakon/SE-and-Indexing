<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The known technical solutions are based on the transmission of the 16-kHz-frequency pulse to the telephone subscriber, its evaluation and the output of a corresponding charge information item. Since such a charge information item is based on adding together all transmitted pulses, interference on the transmission path will falsify the charge information. 2.2 According to the invention, this defect is eliminated by an information device (IE) arranged at the exchange, which is directly connected to the subscriber-individual tariff unit meter (TEZ) and which meters the original tariff information items of the corresponding tariff unit meter (TEZ). The respective current tariff information item is transmitted to the telephone subscriber on request. 2.3 If errors occur during the transmission, the charge information will also be falsified but, in contrast to the known solutions in which the errors are added together, the inquiry for further charge information will lead to a correction of the charge information in the solution according to the invention.
