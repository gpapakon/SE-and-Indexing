<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bipolar electric 
storage batteries of the face-to-face electrode type, 
and more 
particularly to a unique packaging arrangement 
therefor and method of assembling the battery. Bipolar batteries employ either one of two 
types of bipolar electrodes, i.e., face-to-face or 
side-by-side. Face-to-face type bipolar electrodes, 
utilise an electrolyte-resistant, impervious, 
substantially planar, conductive septum having a first 
polarity active material on one face thereof and an 
opposite polarity active material on an opposite face 
thereof. It is known for the electrically-conductive 
septum that separates the opposite polarity active 
materials of the bipolar electrode to comprise either 
(1) a thin metal plate (eg, lead in the case of a 
Pb-acid battery), (2) an electrically-conductive 
polymer, or (3) a non-conductive polymer having a 
plurality of rivet-like conductors embedded therein 
for electrically communicating one face of the septum 
to the other. For a number of reasons, the use of 
solid metal plates is preferred for long-lived, 
high-power, bipolar batteries. A metal plate septum 
particularly useful for lead acid batteries is 
described in our co-pending patent application EP-A-0630063 
(US-A-5344727) corresponding to United States patent 
application US Serial No 08/079,030 filed concurrently 
herewith. Other metal or conductive septums are 
useful with other types of battery systems (eg, 
alkaline batteries) as is well-known in the art. The bipolar electrodes are mounted in 
non-conductive frames and stacked together such that 
opposite polarity faces of adjacent bipolar electrodes 
oppose each other across an electrolyte-filled gap  
 
which also contains an electrolyte-permeable, 
dendrite-suppressing separator (eg, microporous 
polyethylene, glass mat, or microporous PVC). One 
such battery is exemplified by US-A-3,728,158 (Poe et 
al). The frames used to mount the bipolar 
electrodes are typically either clamped or adhesively 
secured together to form the finished battery. 
Neither are practical solutions to making such 
batteries. In this regard, clamping the frames 
typically adds extra weight to the system and results 
in an assembly susceptible to electrolyte leakage via 
any of the many seams between the many abutting 
frames. Adhesively securing the frames together on 
the other hand is extremely messy, especially when 
coupled with all of the handling, alignment, and 
assembly requirements for so many individual 
components to form the finished

<CLAIMS>
A bipolar battery comprising: a stack 
of substantially planar, bipolar electrodes each 

comprising a conductive, electrolyte-impervious, 
septum (2) having a positive polarity active 

material on one face of said septum (2), and an 
opposite polarity active material on an opposite 

face of said septum (2); a monopolar electrode at 
each end of said stack; non-conductive first frames 

(6) each embedding the perimeter of each said septum 
(2); non-conductive second frames (30) for spacing 

said electrodes from each other in said stack 
defining an electrolyte retention region (32) 

between adjacent electrodes; an electrolyte-absorbent 
mat in each said retention region between 

adjacent said electrodes; terminal means (50,52,54) 
engaging said monopolar electrodes for electrically 

connecting said battery to external electrical 
circuitry; and a polymeric housing (60) moulded 
in situ
 
about said stack by using, as a starting 

material, a plastics material including an 
activatable expandable foaming agent, compressing 

the stack such that said frames (6,30) are held 
together in abutting relation to each other and said 

mats are compressed, injecting said material in 
molten form into the mould, activating said agent 

for foaming said material in the mould, and allowing 
said foamed plastics material to harden so as to 

retain the stack under compression. 
A bipolar battery according to claim 
1, in which said foaming agent produces a plastics  

 
foam having a porosity of up to about twenty-five 

percent (25%) by volume. 
A bipolar battery according to claim 
1, in which said polymeric housing (60) is moulded 

from a thermoplastic polymer. 
A method of assembling a 
gas-recombinant, bipolar battery comprising a stack 

of bipolar electrodes each including a conductive, 
electrolyte impervious septum having a perimeter 

each embedded in a non-conductive first frame (6) 
and separated one from the other by an electrolyte-retention 

region (32) defined by a non-conductive 
second frame (30), and serving to space said 

electrodes from each other by a gap of predetermined 
width, the method comprising the steps of: 


a. positioning a gas-recombinant-type 
fibrous glass mat separator (58) in said region (32) 

between said electrodes, said separator (58), in its 
uncompressed state, having a thickness greater than 

said gap width; 
b. positioning said stack in a mould 
between a pair of opposing mould parts moveable to 

and fro with respect to each other, said mould 
defining a mould cavity for forming an external 

housing (60) around said stack; 
c. moving said mould parts together so as 
to close said mould to compress said separators (58) 

and abut said frames one to the next; 
d. injecting a molten plastics material 
into said cavity around said stack, said material 

including an expandable foaming agent activatable 
after injection of said material;  

 
e. activating said foaming agent for 
foaming said material in said mould about said 

stack; and 
f. allowing said plastics material to 
harden to form said housing (60) and to retain said 

stack under compression. 
A method according to claim 4, in 
which said foaming agent is heat-activated to 

generate gas bubbles throughout the plastics

A method of forming a housing (60) 
about a bipolar battery comprising a stack of
