<ABSTRACT>
In a method for coating a material and, thus, for producing a lining, there is first (1, 2) applied a dispersion, containing a thermoplastic polymer and an additive, on the surface of a material, i.e. a web (R). The latter is then exposed to a powerful thermal effect in operation (3). This is followed by operations (4, 5) for drying a lining (P) being formed. The invention relates also to the structure of lining (P) as well as to an apparatus for producing said lining (P) by applying the above method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lining material.Particularly, but not exclusively, the invention
relates to a lining used for coating a plastic or
fiber material in a manner that at least one of the
surfaces of a sheet-like, film-like or web-like
material carries said lining, which has thermoplastic
properties and is capable of providing desired tightness
properties.Until now, linings suitable for the above purpose
have been primarily produced by the application of
two methods. It can be said that the first method is
effected by delivering melted polymer through a slit
orifice onto the surface of a web-like material. The
polymers used in this method are polyoleofines, which
have been melted from a granular starting material
for delivering it through a slit orifice. The melt
polymer stock is delivered in a single layer or in
plural layers directly onto a web-like material
advancing on a carrier track with temperature in the
contact area typically within the range of 120-240°C.
It is obvious that this produces a corresponding
thermal stress for a material to be coated. A natural
consequence of this is that a major thermal stress
limits the use of heat-sensitive materials in the
applications of this method, although, at least in
some applications, it is possible to cool the carrier
track i.e. the backing surface.In addition, a method based on the delivery of polymer
effected through a slit orifice is typically hampered
by problems associated with the adhesion of a coating.
For example, when coating cardboard by using PET
(polyethylene terephtalate), suitable raw materials 
are both scarcely available and their use requires
that an apparatus for effecting the method be provided
with expensive accessories. One example of the above
can be said to be the commercially available Melinar
102 S, which is used by Iggesund and is more expensive
than a basic polyester by about 20 %. In addition, an
apparatus for applying the method by using the above
Melinar 102 S polymer requires a specially designed
extruder provided with a screw mechanism required by
polyethylene terephtalate, as well as a pressure-equalizing
pump. There is further required a separate
cardboard pretreatment mechanism, which is fitted with
heating and ozonation units, the latter explicitly for
oxidation. Another drawback in the method is that, if
the desired end product includes hot-sealing linings,
the adhesion can only be achieved by applying appropriate
primers on top of the polyethylene terephtalate
layer or oriented polyethylene
