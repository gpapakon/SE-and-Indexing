<ABSTRACT>
In a stencil printing device, a plurality of 
printing drums are mounted on a turret-like printing 

drum supporting member, and the indexing rotary 
movement of the printing drum supporting member and the 

rotary actuation of each of the printing drums thereon 
are effected by a common motor without regard to the 

number of the printing drums so that the overall 
structure can be simplified, and the control of the 

indexing rotary movement of the planetary plate disk 
and the rotary actuation of each of the printing drums 

can be accomplished in a centralized manner. The 
present invention is particularly useful in a stencil 

printing for full color printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil
printing device, and an assembly for supporting a
plurality of printing drums for rotative actuation
thereof in a stencil printing device.According to a previously proposed multi printing
drum stencil printing device which is disclosed in
Japanese patent publication for opposition purpose
(kokoku) No. 04-15739, a plurality of printing drums
are mounted on a planetary disk (printing drum
supporting member) which is adapted to be rotated
around its center of rotation, with each printing drum
adapted to be rotated around a central axial line
thereof, and each of the printing drums is selectively
brought to a stencil printing position opposing a press
roller by the indexing action of the planetary disk.According to this multi printing drum stencil
printing device, by using a printing ink of a different
color for each of the printing drums, a stencil
printing of a desired color, a multi color stencil
printing or a full color stencil printing using the
colors of cyan, magenta, yellow and black can be
accomplished by the indexing action of the planetary
disk without involving the need for replacing the
printing drums.According to such a conventional multi printing
drum stencil printing device, the indexing movement of
the planetary disk and the rotative actuation of the
printing drums were effected by separate electric
motors, and the number of necessary electric motors was
equal to the number of the printing drums plus one. 
Therefore, five electric motors were necessary when
there were four printing drums for full color printing.
This is highly detrimental to the compact and light
weight design of the stencil printing device, and also
contributes to the increase in the cost.Furthermore, these motors were required to be
individually controlled, and not only the mechanical
structure but also the control system tended to be
highly complex. Also, the efforts and cost required
for maintenance were also substantial.In view of such problems of the prior art, a
primary object of the present invention is to provide a
a stencil printing device which is provided with a
plurality of printing drums but is highly compact in
design.A second object of the present invention is to
provide a stencil printing device which is capable of
multi color printing in a highly automated fashion in a
highly reliable manner.A third object of the present invention is to
provide a stencil printing device which is provided
with a plurality of printing drums but is highly simple
in the control
