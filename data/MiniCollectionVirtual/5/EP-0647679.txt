<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to thermoplastic resin 
composition containing a polycarbonate resin. Resin compositions containing polycarbonate resins and ABS 
resins have superior properties such as impact resistance and 
dimensional accuracy, and are widely used for the interiors and 
exteriors of automobiles and housings of OA [office automation] 
devices. Especially in housings for different types of devices, 
reduced thicknesses of the materials used is on the increase in 
response to the current demand for devices with reduced cost and 
reduced weight. In order to meet the demand described above, an 
improvement in the flow properties of hot-melt resin materials is 
strongly needed. In the past, as a means to improve the flow 
properties, a method consisting of decreasing the molecular 
weight of matrix-type polycarbonate resins has been used, but in 
said method, the impact resistance of the molded product becomes 
inferior; therefore, it is not suitable. Also, an attempt has been made in an effort to improve the 
rigidity and dimensional accuracy by mixing an inorganic filler, 
for example, glass fibers, with a resin composition containing a 
polycarbonate resin and ABS resin. The resin composition 
produced above is used for chassis materials, etc., for various 
types of OA machines. Among the above-mentioned applications, in 
the case of applications such as base chassis that comprised the 
external portions of parts, superior surface appearance and good 
dye affinity required. However, in resin compositions comprised 
of polycarbonate/ABS resins, the surface smoothness is poor due 
to "floating" of inorganic fillers included in the resin, and it 
is not possible to retain a good surface appearance. As a means 
to improve the problem described above, an increase in the die 
temperature at the time of the molding process is conceivable, 
but the molding cycle becomes long, and it is not suitable.  The objective of the present invention is to produce a 
thermoplastic resin composition containing a polycarbonate-type 
resin with good hot-melt flow properties and high mechanical 
strength. Furthermore, the objective of the present invention is to 
produce a thermoplastic resin composition containing a 
polycarbonate type resin capable of retaining the surface 
appearance of the molded product, even when an inorganic filler 
is included as a reinforcing material, and at the same time, 
having good hot-melt adhesive flow properties. The present invention is to produce a thermoplastic resin 
composit
