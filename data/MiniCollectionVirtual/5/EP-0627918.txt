<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to omega-3-fatty acid containing preparations for the treatment of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and symptoms related to DIC, as well as such preparations for reducing a pathological increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The preparations may be in the form of emulsions, or aerosols for inhalation, of an oil or phospholipids or other derivatives or salts of omega-3-fatty acids of marine and/or vegetable origin with a significant content of omega-3-fatty acids. The preparations may also be in tablet or capsule form for oral use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of omega-3-fatty acids (hereafter
called ω3-fatty acids) for the treatment of or for preventing the development
of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (hereafter called DIC; for
abbreviations, see the appended Abbreviation List) as well as reducing a
pathological increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The preparations
to be used may be in the form of emulsions for parenteral or enteral
administration, or for example in the form of aerosols for inhalation or in a
form for oral administration. The ω3-fatty adds (or salts or derivatives
thereof) can originate from a marine or vegetable oil, from phospholipids, or
be of synthetic origin.Today one of the major challenges for intensive care is to combat the
secondary hypoperfusion syndromes seen after septicemia, trauma and
malignancies. These syndromes include uncontrolled activation of the
cascade systems (coagulation, fibrinolyses, kallikrein-kinin-, complement
systems) often described as post traumatic micro embolism or disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) gives rise to a wide variety of
symptoms, to some extent caused by massive disseminated microembolism.
There seem to be various target organs partly due to the inducing agent or
cause as well as to probably a number of unknown factors.
A common situation in patients who develope DIC is pulmonary
microembolism which could lead to severe problems of gas exchange,
oedema and subsequent increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP).According to the literature (Medicine, Edited by E Rubenstein and D D
Federman published by Scientific American, New York, 1988, chapter 5:VI,
Hemostasis and coagulation, p35-38) there are a plurality of circumstances
that can initiate the DIC-syndrome. Such circumstances may be massive
tissue damage, leading to the release of huge amounts of tissue
thromboplastic materials, causing extensive activation of the extrinsic
system or extensive destruction of endothelial surfaces. The circumstances
can be caused by for example severe injuries and infections, tumor products, 
hemolytic transfusion reactions, vasculitis, heatstroke, hemangomias and
certain snake bites. In all cases this leads to a massive activation of the
hemostatic mechanisms, which overwhelms the inhibitor mechanisms.The entire scheme of coagulation either initiated by the intrinsic, including the
kallikrein - Factor XII, pathway or extrinsic pathways is finely tuned to culminate
in a burst of thrombin activity,
