<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutically acceptable, non-immunogenic conjugates are formed by covalently binding a biologically inactive, natural polymer or derivative thereof to pharmaceutically pure, synthetic hydrophilic polymers via specific types of chemical bonds. The biocompatible conjugates can be used for soft tissue augmentation and for coating or forming various articles. The synthetic hydrophilic polymer may be polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof having a weight average molecular weight over a range of from about 100 to about 100,000. The compositions may include other components such as liquid, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to form injectable formulations, and/or biologically active proteins such as growth factors or cytokines. The conjugates generally contain large amounts of water when formed and can be dehydrated to form a solid object which can subsequently be ground into particles and suspended in a non-aqueous fluid for injection into a mammal to provide the soft tissue augmentation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BICCOMPATIBLE POLYMER CONJUGATESTechnical FieldThis invention relates to biocompatible conjugates formed by covalently binding two or more polymers together and, specifically, to conjugates formed by binding a naturally occurring polymer or derivative thereof to a synthetic hydrophilic polymer, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) , and to compositions, components, and implants comprised of such conjugates.Background of the InventionA number of naturally occurring but biologically inert polymers are known. Examples of such include collagen and various glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfates, chitin, and heparin. Derivatives of these polymers have also been produced and certain derivatives have been formulated for medical use. A number of synthetic biologically inert polymers are also known, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG). Various combinations of natural and synthetic polymers give a wide range of characteristics for use in a variety of medical applications. We have now invented new and useful conjugates combining the characteristics of natural and synthetic polymers and applied these conjugates to medical formulations, components, and implants which specifically benefit from these characteristics. 

Summary of the InventionConjugates are formed by covalently binding insoluble, naturally occurring, biologically inert polymers and derivatives thereof to synthetic, hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) . The naturally-occurring polymers and derivatives thereof include polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate A (4-sulfate) , chondroitin sulfate C (6-sulfate) , and dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B) ; chitin; heparin and heparin sulfate; dextrans such as cyclodextran, hydroxylethyl cellulose, cellulose ether, and starch; lipids (esters of fatty acids with trihydroxyl alcohol glycerol) such as triglycerides, phospholipids, and the like. The synthetic hydrophilic polymer is preferably polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof having a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 100 to about 100,000 preferably about 1,500 to 20,000. Compositions and components may be formulated using the conjugates and other components such as pharmaceutically acceptable fluid carriers to form injectable formulations, and/or biologically active proteins such as cytokines and growth factors. The biocompatible conjugates of the invention generally contain large amounts of water when formed and can be dehydrated to form a
