<ABSTRACT>
A deceleration warning device and a method for its control serve to reduce the risk of rear-end collisions in road traffic or in other movement processes. In order to avoid or to reduce the disadvantages of conventional brake lights and flashing hazard warning systems, the intensity of warning given by the deceleration warning device of a vehicle travelling ahead is dependent on the size of the risk value G which originates from this vehicle and can be effective for subsequent vehicles.

Deceleration Warning system for reducing the danger of collision accidents in road
traffic, whereby the intensity of the Warning by the deceleration warning system of a

vehicle ahead depends on the level of a danger value (G) which is emitted by this
vehicle and which can be effective for following vehicles, which danger value (G)

depends on the deceleration (b) and the time (t) or the distance (s) during which the
deceleration is present, characterised in that the danger value determining the intensity

of the warning is an overall danger value (ΣG) which is determined by a time integral
or distance integral of the form
