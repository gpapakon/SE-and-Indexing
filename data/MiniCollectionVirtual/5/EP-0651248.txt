Water quality sensor apparatus comprising a substrate on 
which a plurality of sensors are supported in spaced apart 

relationship, each sensor being responsive to a different water 
characteristic and each sensor comprising a sensor region which, 

in use, is arranged to be contiguous with water the characteristics 
of which are to be sensed, which sensor regions are electrically 

connected to connector means via conductors supported on the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water quality sensor apparatus and more
especially it relates to apparatus for sensing contemporaneously a plurality
of different characteristics appertaining to the quality of water.It is known to provide, for pollution control purposes for example,
water quality monitoring apparatus which comprises a submersible
assembly of individually fabricated sensors, one for each characteristic to
be monitored. European patent application 0493819A1 discloses a water
quality checker comprising a sensor member body having a circular end
portion provided with a plurality of kinds of water quality measuring
sensors. These sensors hang down from a lower end surface of the sensor
member body. In Patent Abstracts of Japan volume 13, number 395,
Taisei Corp discloses apparatus to measure in real time different
parameters of water, such as water temperature, chlorine content, dissolved
oxygen, and pH. These known apparatus have several disadvantages
including high cost of manufacture, comparatively large size and
inconvenient accessibility to the sensors for maintenance purposes.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved water
quality sensor apparatus wherein one or more of the foregoing problems is
substantially obviated.According to the present invention water quality sensor apparatus
comprises a substrate on which a plurality of sensors are supported in
spaced apart relationship, each sensor being responsive to a different water
characteristic and each sensor comprising a sensor region which, in use, is 
arranged to be contiguous with water the characteristics of which are to be
sensed, which sensor regions are electrically connected to connector
means via conductors supported on the substrate, the conductors and the
connector means being arranged to be non-contiguous with the water in
use of the apparatus, characterised in that the substrate on which a
plurality of sensors are supported is substantially flat.In alternative embodiments the substrate may be cylindrical and/or
tubular, the sensors being carried on an inner or outer cylindrical surface.Sensors may be provided for dissolved oxygen, pH conductivity,
and temperature.Reference electrodes may additionally be provided on the same
substrate or alternatively they may comprise a separate assembly, and a
redox sensor may also be provided.In one embodiment of the invention, a dielectric substrate is
provided having supported on one side thereof reference electrodes, a
dissolved oxygen sensor and a pH sensor, and on the
