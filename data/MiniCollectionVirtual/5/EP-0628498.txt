<CLAIMS>
Container comprising wall elements delimiting a container inner space, 
which form at least one front element (1), two side elements (2), at least one 

back element (3), at least one roof element(4) as well as at least one base 
element (5) and which are detachably connected to one another via connecting 

pieces (8), in which the container is able to be dismantled in such a way that 
the elements of this container are stackable on the base element (5) for 

transport of the container characterised in that for the formation of the 
container as a an air conditioned or refrigerated container, the front element (1) 

has a non-opening panel (10) as well as at least one hinged door (11), that on 
the front element (1), at least one air conditioning or refrigerating unit (19) is 

provided and that on the inner surface of the container thermal insulation is 
provided, which comprises a plurality of insulating plates (20), detachably 

connected with one another as well as with the wall elements of the container. 
Container according to claim 1 characterised in that at least the 
outerlying wall portions forming the side elements and the roof element have a 

supporting portion or a strut (6) forming a supporting frame to which at least 
one profiled sheet, preferably a steel sheet (7), is fixed as a wall element. 
Container according to claim 2, characterised in that the profiled sheet 
(7) has a trapezoidal profile.  

 
Container according to one of claims 1-3 characterised in that the base 
element (5) comprises at least one trough-like element (14), which is fixed by 

the underside to at least one strut (6) provided under the base element (5) and 
that in the trough-like element (14) a thermal insulation (16) is provided. 
Container according to claim 4 characterised in that on the open side of 
the trough-like element (14) a base plate (17) is provided, which is held at the 

bottom of the trough-like element (14) via a spacer (15). 
Container according to claim 2 characterised in that the struts (6) of the 
side elements, of at least one roof element (4) as well as of the base element (5) 

are connected via connecting pieces (8) with one another to a closed, vertical, 
outerlying support or strut-frame. 
Container according to one of claims 1-5 characterised through fasteners 
(21) or fastening elements (22, 23) for the detachable connection of the 

insulating plates (20) to one another as well as to the inside of the wall element.
