<ABSTRACT>
The converter includes a rectifier circuit (2), choppers, circuits (14) and (20) for controlling the choppers and an input filter (3, 4, 5, 8 and 9) of LC type. The control circuits include loops for regulating the output voltages V+, V-, and currents Ih+, Ih- of the choppers, as well as a loop for regulating the current flowing in the filter and the rectifier. This supplementary regulation makes it possible to damp oscillations generated in the input filter by the current samples. The values of the positive and negative components of the currents in the input filter and the rectifier are supplied by sensors (29-31) or (33 and 34), to the control circuits (14, 20).
