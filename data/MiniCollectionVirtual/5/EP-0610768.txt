<ABSTRACT>
In an enclosed gas filled electric conductor 
arrangement, at least the surface (3A) at the bottom 

side of an electric conductor (3) is formed in an 
inclined surface by gradually reducing the cross section 

(D1, D2) of the electric conductor from one insulator 
spacer (2A) at one side toward another insulator spacer 

(2B) at the other side. 
Because of an angle (ϑ ) of the inclined surface 
(3A), the spacing distance between the electric conductor 

(3) and the bottom surface (1A) of a grounded tank (1) 
increases depending upon distance away from one insulator 

spacer (2A), thereby, a conductive foreign particle (50) 
is designed to move away from the surface of the 

insulator spacer (2A) and is trapped by a conductive 
foreign particle trapping means (10) disposed at the 

center bottom surface (1A) of the grounded tank, and is 
prevented from being deposited on the insulator spacer 

(2A), thereby, the insulation reliability of the enclosed 
electric conductor arrangement for the gas insulated 

apparatus is enhanced as well as the size and weight of 
the arrangement can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an electric 
power transformation installation and, in particular, relates 
to an enclosed electric conductor arrangement in which a 
conductor is supported by insulating spacers within a container. One of the significant problems with regard to electric 
insulation of gas insulated apparatus for a DC current transmission, 
such as an enclosed electric conductor arrangement, 
is a reduction of the insulating property thereof due to 
conductive foreign particles incidentally contained within 
the apparatus. In contrast to similar apparatus for an AC 
current transmission, the electric field under an application 
of DC voltage always has a predetermined direction, so that 
when a conductive foreign particle within the apparatus is 
once lifted up by the electric field, the conductive foreign 
particle moves up to a high voltage electric conductor while 
maintaining the lifted condition. As a result, the conductive 
foreign particle is deposited in a region  
 
of high electric field and on a surface of an insulator, 
which endangers the insulating property of the apparatus. For countering the above problem, there are known measures, 
which make use of a specific behaviour of a conductive 
foreign particle under electric field, such as providing disposing 
a tubular container with an inclined bottom surface 
and providing a conductive foreign particle trapping device 
on that bottom surface; see, for example, US-A-4,029,890 and 
Technical Report of Japan Institute of Electrical Engineers 
No. 397 (Part II); "DC Insulation for Gas Insulated Switch-gear" 
(1991, 12, pp 9∼17) both of which documents disclose 
the features included in the first part of claim 1. However, conductive foreign particles under DC voltage 
application behave as explained above, in that they easily 
reach a high voltage conductor once they have been lifted, so 
that such countermeasures as providing an inclination at the 
container are insufficient. An object of the present invention is to provide an enclosed 
electric conductor arrangement with improved insulation 
reliability as well as reduced size and weight. This object is accomplished by the electric conductor 
arrangement defined in claim 1.  
 When a DC voltage is applied to the electric 
conductor, an up and down jumping phenomenon of a 
conductive foreign particle is repeated, in that, a 
conductive foreign particle on the bottom surface of the 
grounded tank is electrically charged, attracted toward 
the electric conductor which is

spacers (2A, 2B) within a tank (1), wherein the spacing between 
the bottom surface portion (3A) of the conductor and 

the inner bottom surface (1A) of the tank increases with increasing
