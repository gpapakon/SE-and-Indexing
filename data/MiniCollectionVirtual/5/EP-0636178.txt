 PROTOCADHERINS , THEIR ANTIBODIES AND USESThis application in a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/998,003 which was filed on December 29, 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in general, to materials and methods relevant to cell-cell adhesion. More particularly, the invention relates to novel adhesion proteins, designated protocadherins, and to polynucleotide sequences encoding the protocadherins. The invention also relates to methods for inhibiting binding of the protocadherins to their natural ligands/antiligands.BACKGROUNDIn vivo, intercellular adhesion plays an important role in a wide range of events including morphogenesis and organ formation, leukocyte extravasion, tumor metastasis and invasion, and the formation of cell junctions. Additionally, cell-cell adhesion is crucial for the maintenance of tissue integrity. Intercellular adhesion is mediated by specific cell surface adhesion molecules. Cell adhesion molecules have been classified into at least four families including the immunoglobulin superfamily, the integrin superfamily, the selectin family and the cadherin superfamily. All cell types that form solid tissues express some members of the cadherin superfamily suggesting that cadherins are involved in selective adhesion of most cell types.Cadherins have been generally described as glycosylated integral membrane proteins that have an N-terminal extracellular domain (the N-terminal 113 amino acids of the domain appear to be directly involved in binding) consisting of five subdomains characterized by sequences unique to cadherins, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton through catenins and other cytoskeleton- associated proteins. Some cadherins lack a cytoplasmic domain, however, and appear to function in cell-cell adhesion by a different mechanism than cadherins 

having a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain is required for the adhesive function of the extracellular domain in cadherins that do have an cytoplasmic domain. Binding between members of the cadherin family expressed on different cells is homophilic (i.e. , a member of the cadherin family binds to cadherins of its own or a closely related subclass) and Ca2+-dependent. For recent reviews on cadherins, see Takeichi, Annu. Rev. Biochem. , 59: 237-252 (1990) and Takeichi, Science, 251: 1451-1455 (1991).The first cadherins to be described (E-cadherin in mouse epithelial cells, L-CAM in avian liver,
