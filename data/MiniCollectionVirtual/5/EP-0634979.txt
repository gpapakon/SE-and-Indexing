<CLAIMS>
Control installation for a motor vehicle to aid driving 
by persons with lower-limb disabilities, comprising: 


a plurality of control members by which control 
orders are given and comprising a first set of 

controls for the accelerator (2) and the brake 
(5), 
a set of motors (8), each controlling respectively 
one of the pedals on the pedal support or any 

other element allowing control, 
at least one wireless or wired member (6) for 
transmitting the orders given by the first control 

set, 
at least one member for receiving said control 
orders coupled to an electronic servo-control unit 

(7) for the motors and 
members (15) for transmission from each of the 
motors to the corresponding brake and accelerator 

pedal,
 
characterised in that: 
the first set of controls is located on the 
steering wheel, 
said plurality of control members comprises a 
second set of controls, independent of the 

steering wheel, for the clutch (11) and the brakes 
(12), 
the installation comprises a wired (13) or 
wireless transmission for the orders given by the  

 
second set of controls independent of the steering 

wheel, 
said set of motors (8) comprises a motor 
controlling the clutch pedal and connected to said 

clutch pedal by a transmission member. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the set of controls on the steering wheel for the 

accelerator and the brake is constituted by; 

at least one sensor (2) mounted on the steering 
wheel to control the accelerator, 
at least one sensor to control the brake, 
at least one radio-transmitter component. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the steering wheel (1) is provided with an inner hoop 

(39) rotating freely with respect to the steering 
wheel, said hoop carrying two concentric annular 

sensors (34A), (34B), one for the brake and the other 
for the accelerator. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the set of motors comprises the same number of motors 

(8) as there are pedals on the pedal support or 
elements to be controlled, and that each of the motors 

(8) actuates a winch (14), the cable (15) of which is 
connected to the corresponding pedal. 
Installation according to Claim 3 characterised in that 
each of the motors is servo-controlled in terms of 

position by the electronic unit (7). 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that  
 

the second set of controls for the brake and the clutch 
is mounted on the knob (10) of the gear-change lever, 

that it comprises a clutch-control member (11) and a 
brake-control member (12), these control members each 

actuating a sensor, said controls being connected by 
wire (13) to the electronic servo-control unit (7) of 

the motors. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the accelerator control of the steering wheel is 

mounted on an inner hoop (3) of the steering wheel. 
Installation according to Claim 1 and any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the actuation 

value of the sensors of the steering-wheel controls 
conditions the accelerator or braking value. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the brake controls (5) are provided with a system for 

restoring effort that allows the user to feel the 
braking point. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the clutch control (11) is equipped with a double-rigidity 

spring system and/or a double spring system 
that makes it possible to materialise the clutch point. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the braking control (12) is provided with a system of 

hardening on compression connected by a pipe (17) to 
the master cylinder. 
Installation according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
it is provided with a safety device for the pedal 

support. 
Installation according to Claims 1 and 12 characterised  
 

in that the pedal-support safety device is constituted 
by an obstacle in front of the pedal support, said 

obstacle being removable or movable. 
Installation according to Claims 12 and 13 
characterised in that the obstacle is constituted by a 

wall (40) hinged at (41) to the floor and coming into 
the vertical or substantially vertical position, 

manually or automatically, in the limit position (42). 
Installation according to Claims 12 and 14 
characterised in that putting the wall (40) into the 

limit position allows the installation to be put into 
operation.
