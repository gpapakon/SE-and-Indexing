<ABSTRACT>
A process and system for controlling thermal comfort in 
a passenger compartment (CAR) of a motor vehicle, in 

which the variable controlled is not the air temperature 
(Ta) but the equivalent temperature (Teq). The 

equivalent temperature (Teq) in an environment X is 
defined as the temperature of the walls and the air of an 

unventilated environment in which a human being would 
experience the same temperature sensation as it 

experiences in the environment X. The equivalent 
temperature (Teq) can be detected by a specific sensor 

(STE) or can be estimated from measurement (MIS) detected 
by conventional sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to processes and 
systems for controlling thermal comfort in an 
environment, and particularly in the passenger 
compartment of a vehicle, as known e.g. from US-A-5 145 112. Numerous examples of control and air conditioning 
processes and systems for motor vehicles are known in the 
art; however, none of these systems is able to ensure 
optimum thermal comfort within a motor vehicle because of 
the intrinsic difficulty of this task. In fact, the 
passenger vehicle of a motor vehicle is a very difficult 
environment to control thermally because of its small 
dimensions and high exposure to external factors due to 
the glass surfaces, the low thermal insulation and the 
flow of air over the vehicle. The passenger compartment is therefore exposed to strong 
external influences such as solar radiation, which is 
even more intense through the glass surfaces which are 
becoming ever more extensive on current motor vehicles, 
and the moisture of the air which typically is determined 
by the air outside the vehicle. On the other hand, the 
weight and dimensions of the motor vehicle result in 
thermal insulation being kept to a minimum.  
 The most developed systems currently installed on motor 
vehicles allow the user to set the desired temperature 
within the passenger compartment and then maintain this 
temperature by utilising a classic closed loop control 
procedure and a temperature sensor within the passenger 
compartment. This procedure is certainly better than the older air 
conditioning systems which typically used an open loop 
control and required continuous adjustment by the user. 
However, even the more developed air conditioning systems 
still have significant disadvantages. The systems known 
in the art do in fact control the air temperature within 
the passenger compartment; however, the sensation of 
thermal comfort which the user experiences is 
not dependent only on the air temperature, but on other 
factors such as the solar radiation, the relative 
humidity and the presence of air currents (due for 
example to the air outlets of the air conditioning 
system) within the passenger compartment. Other contributory factors which affect thermal comfort 
are the type of clothing worn by the user (which 
naturally depends on the external environmental 
conditions) and the temperature of, and therefore the 
radiation from the internal walls of the passenger 
compartment due to the temperature and flow of air 
outside the motor vehicle.  
 This therefore
