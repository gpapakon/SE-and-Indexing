<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for automatic generation of sequences (notably temporal or
spatial sequences) from items in a database involves the organisation of the data in a

generic format, and the formulation of the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem
using special constraint classes. The database format includes attribute values referring to a

predetermined taxonomy allowing similarity and difference between the respective values
to be evaluated. The special constraint classes include the classes of cardinality constraints

(which allow it to be specified that the number of items whose attribute belongs to a given
set is within a particular range and/or that the number of values of an attribute is within a

specified range), similarity or dissimilarity constraints (which allow it to be specified that
successive items must be similar or different from each other) and global difference

constraints (which allow it to be specified that the respective values of a given attribute for
all items in a range must be different from each other).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the field of the generation of sequences
and, in particular, the generation of sequences of items from a database such that the
relationship between the attributes of the component items in the sequence is controlled.It is to be understood that in the present description the term "database" is used to
designate my collection of data, for example covering both pro-stored data and data which
is dynamically collected.There are many situations in which it is necessary or desirable to create a sequence
of items from a collection of items for which data is available, and it is important that the
created sequence should be "coherent", that is, that there should be a particular relationship
between attributes of the component items in the sequence (typically involving a criterion
that the attributes of the component items of the sequence should not be too dissimilar,
especially for successive items in the sequence). The sequences in question include
temporal sequences and spatial sequences. A typical case where this problem arises is in
the field of multimedia and, notably, the problem of automatic generation of recitals (such a
recital is an example of a temporal sequence). Here the term "recital" is used not only to
designate a sequence of musical pieces but, more generally, any temporal sequence of
multimedia items (film clips, documentaries, text items, etc.). An example of a problem
involving a spatial sequence concerns the designing of a thematically-linked layout of
paintings for rooms in an art gallery.It has been proposed in the paper "Répresentation de séquences définies sur des
ensembles non instanciés par arbre PQR partiel" by Berkaoui et al (Journées Francophones
de Programmation Logique par Contraintes, 1998] to use a Constraint Satisfaction
approach for solving scheduling problems. However, the approach proposed in this paper
does not consider the "coherence" of the sequence of items which is produced, notably it
does not enable the similarity or dissimilarity of items making up the sequence to be
controlled.The present invention provides a system and method which produces "coherent"
sequences of items in a particular order. The items are, generally, stored in a database and
described in terms of data pairs each consisting of an attribute and the corresponding value.
The problem of creating the desired sequence is treated as a Constraint Satisfaction
Problem (CSP). The sequence to be obtained is specified by formulating a collection of
constraints

<CLAIMS>
A method of generating sequencing information representing a sequence made from a
set of items selected in a database, comprising the steps of :


a) providing a database having therein data representative of the attributes of a

plurality of items;
b) specifying desired features of the sequence in terms of requirements on values
and/or variation in values of attributes of items in the desired sequence;
c) modelling the task of generating the desired sequence as a Constraint
Satisfaction Problem, the respective variables of the problem corresponding to

the items in the desired sequence, and the respective constraints of the problem
corresponding to the desired features specified in the specifying step; and
d) applying constraint satisfaction programming techniques whereby to solve the
modelled Constraint Satisfaction Problem.
The method according to claim 1, wherein:

the database-providing step comprises providing a database in which each item has
at least one attribute for which a predetermined taxonomy is provided in association

with the database, the predetermined taxonomy defining similarity and difference
between different values of said attribute, and
the modelling step comprises generating at least one constraint requiring similarity
or dissimilarity of an attribute between different items in the desired sequence.
The method of claim 2, wherein the modelling step comprises generating at least one
constraint requiring similarity or dissimilarity of a attribute between successive items

of a sub-set of contiguous items in the desired sequence.
The method of claim 2, wherein the modelling step comprises generating at least one
constraint requiring similarity or dissimilarity of an attribute between all items in the

desired sequence.
The method according to my previous claim, wherein:

the modelling step comprises generating at least one constraint requiring that, in the
desired sequence, the number of items whose attribute (j) takes a value belonging to

a given set (E) must be within a specified range (a,b).
The method of claim 5, wherein the modelling step comprises generating at least one
constraint requiring that, in a sub-set of contiguous items in the desired sequence, the

number of items whose attribute (j) takes a value belonging to a given set (E) must be
within a specified range (a,b).
The method according to any previous claim, wherein:

the modelling step comprises generating at least one constraint requiring that, in the
desired sequence, the number of different values for a attribute (j) of a number of

items must be within a specified range (a,b).
The method of claim 7, wherein the modelling step comprises generating at least one
constraint requiring that, in a sub-set of contiguous items in the desired sequence, the

number of different values for a attribute (j) of the items of the sub-set must be within
a specified rage (a,b).
An automatic recital-generation method, comprising the method of any previous claim
for generating sequencing information representing a sequence made from a set of

musical pieces selected in a database, wherein the database-providing step comprises
the providing of a database of musical pieces.
A system adapted to implement the method of my of claims 1 to 9, comprising a
general-purpose computer and a monitor for display of the generated sequencing

information.
