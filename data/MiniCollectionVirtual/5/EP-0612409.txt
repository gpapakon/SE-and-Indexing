<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to systems for 
electrically measuring certain chemical characteristics of 
fluids, e.g., concentration of certain analytes such as 
ions, gases and metabolites in human blood, and, more 
particularly, to electrical circuits for reducing the 
effects of electrical interference in such measurement 
systems. Systems of this general kind can take the form 
of blood chemistry diagnostic systems integrated into 
infusion fluid delivery systems of the kind commonly used 
in hospital patient care. Such fluid delivery systems 
infuse nutrients, medications and the like directly into 
the patient at a controlled rate and in precise quantities 
for maximum effectiveness. Infusion fluid delivery 
systems are connected to a patient at an intravenous (IV) 
port, in which a hollow needle/catheter combination is 
inserted into a blood vessel of the patient and thereafter 
an infusion fluid is introduced into the vessel at a 
controlled rate, typically using a peristaltic pump. 
Blood chemistry monitoring systems that are combined with 
infusion delivery systems of this kind use the IV port to 
periodically withdraw a blood sample, perform measurements 
of blood ion concentrations and the like, and then discard 
the blood or reinfuse it into the patient. The system 
then resumes delivery of the infusion fluid. Such combined infusion fluid delivery and blood 
chemistry monitoring systems include an infusion line and 
catheter through which the infusion fluid is provided to 
the patient and blood samples are withdrawn. The infusion 
line incorporates an electrode assembly having 
electrochemical sensors that are periodically exposed to  
 
the blood samples and thereby provide electrical signals 
to an analyzer for conversion into corresponding blood 
chemistry data. A control unit periodically halts 
delivery of the infusion fluid for a brief interval, 
during which time a blood sample is withdrawn from the 
patient into the infusion line and routed to the electrode 
assembly, which then generates the electrical signals. 
After the electrical signals have been received by the 
analyzer, the control unit disposes of the blood or 
reinfuses it into the patient, and the flow of infusion 
fluid is resumed. The electrode assembly typically includes a 
reference electrode and a plurality of sensor electrodes 
that are each sensitive to a particular ion of interest (US-A-4,573,968). 
All of the electrodes are embedded in the base of the 
electrode assembly. Electrochemical sensors generate
