<ABSTRACT>
The device for laying sealing strips (11) in joints (19) of structural parts (17, 18) has an introduction device (10) which directs the sealing strip (11) into the joint (19), a laying device (8) which aligns the sealing strip (11), and a press-on device (7) which presses the sealing strip (11) into the joint (19) and has two press-on surfaces (12, 13), it being possible to change the distance (A) between the press-on surfaces (12, 13).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for installing sealing tapes (11, 39) in joints (19, 41) 
of assembly components (17, 18, 27, 28), comprising an feed 

mechanism (10) which directs the sealing tape (11, 39) into the 
joint (19, 41) and an inserting mechanism (8, 31) which aligns 

the sealing tape (11, 39) in the joint (19, 41), and a stop surface 
(9, 26) with stop surface (9a, 26a) for supporting the device 

against the surface of the assembly component, and a press-on 
mechanism (7, 29), which at least partially intrudes the joint (19, 

41), for securing the sealing tape (11, 39) in the joint (19, 41), 

characterised in that
 the pressure mechanism (7, 29) has at 
least two press-on surfaces (12, 13, 37, 38) for pressing the 

sealing tapes rectangularly against one of the two side walls of 
the joint, and that the distance (A) between the press-on 

surfaces (12, 13, 37, 38) is adjustable. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least 
one press-on surface (13, 37) is connected to a drive which 

moves the one press-on surface (13, 37) relative to the other 
press-on surface (12, 38). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
drive is a manually operated operating device. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
drive is a drive motor (5). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 at least one of the press-on surfaces (13,) is formed by the 
casing surface of a part of an eccenter (14).
