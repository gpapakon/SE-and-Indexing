<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a test method
of a subscriber line transmission system, and
particularly relates to a testing method so adapted as to
be capable of testing a subscriber line and a subscriber
circuit simultaneously.A subscriber line transmission system is one
which concentrates a plurality of subscriber terminals
and connects them to an analog exchange through a PCM
line. When a subscriber terminal exists at a place
remote from any exchange, the 'subscriber line
transmission system is used for connecting such
subscribers with an analog exchange.Development of communication networks in recent
years has enhanced functions of subscriber line
transmission systems. Keeping step with this, a need is
increasing for various tests for maintenance of a
subscriber line transmission system. However, a test for
each circuit takes much time in a subscriber line test.
Therefore, a method in which a test can be efficiently
achieved in a short time is required.US-A-4 581 493 describes a testing and reporting
system for individual telephone subscriber circuits, with
reduced subscriber loop maintenance and repair operating
costs. The system provides for automatic testing of
subscriber lines by dialling and seizing a desired line,
following which the required tests are performed and
reported. Numerous lines can be simultaneously accessed
to perform a wide range of different line tests. A
central controller is provided, as well as a remote
access unit and remote testing unit. When an exchange office with a switching system
has a plurality of subscribers, who are at places remote
from the exchange office, a remote terminal (RT) is
provided at the subscriber side, and a central office
terminal (COT) is provided in the exchange. The
terminals are connected through an optical transmission
line comprising a PCM circuit.Then, in the RT, the subscriber lines
corresponding to the subscribers are concentrated, and a
signal of each subscriber is multiplexed and converted
into a PCM signal. At the same time, in the COT, the 
subscriber lines from the switching system corresponding
to the subscribers are concentrated, and a signal of each
subscriber line is multiplexed and converted into a PCM
signal.With the above arrangement, it becomes possible
to reduce the cost of providing a line between the
switching system and each subscriber, and at the same
time to prevent a loss of a signal in a transmission line
even when the distance between a subscriber and the
exchange office is large.Conventionally, using a subscriber
