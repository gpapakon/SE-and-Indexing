<ABSTRACT>
A device has a pivoted lever (24) for detecting a 
near end state of a roll of paper, and the lever (24) is 

held at a first position by the weight of a roll of 
paper, but is resiliently biased toward a second 

position by a spring (32). When the roll of paper does not 
have a core, and when the weight thereof falls to a 

predetermined value, the lever is moved from the first 
position to the second position due to a resilient force 

of the spring (32). When the roll of paper has a core, and 
when a diameter thereof is reduced to a predetermined 

value, the lever (24) receives the roll of paper in a recess (34) 
formed therein, and is moved from the first position to 

the second position due to a resilient force of the 
spring (32). When the lever is moved to the second position, 

this is detected by a suitable detecting element (40). 
Thus, the detector can detect the near end state of the 

roll of paper without regard to whether the roll of 
paper has a core or not.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
detecting the near end state of a rotatably-held roll 
of paper after paper has been drawn from the roll. 
More particularly, the device can be built into a 
printer, facsimile, or other recording apparatus which 
uses a roll of paper as a recording medium. The term 
"near end state" is used herein to mean the state when 
there is only a small amount of the roll of paper 
remaining. A printer mounted in a terminal of a POS (point of 
sale) system or register usually uses a roll of paper 
as a recording paper therefor. Frequently, the roll of 
paper is held in the system at a position where it 
cannot be observed. As a result, the near end state of 
the roll of paper cannot be visually determined by the 
user. Accordingly, if the time for reloading a new 
roll of paper in the printer is missed and the roll 
already located therein runs out, data to be recorded 
can be lost. To avoid this undesirable situation, a 
detector for detecting the near end state of the roll 
of paper is built into the printer, and functions to 
notify the user when the time has come to place a new 
roll of paper in the printer. Known near end state detectors can be considered 
to be one of two types; one is a type which detects the 
diameter of the roll of paper, while the other is a 
type which detects the weight of the roll of paper. 
The former type is used mainly when the roll of paper 
has a core, and indicates when the diameter of the roll 
has been reduced to a predetermined value due to the 
use of paper therefrom. The latter type is mostly used 
when the roll of paper has no core, and indicates when 
the weight of the paper falls to a predetermined value 
due to the use of the paper from the roll. A printer having either of the two known types of  
 
detector suffers from the problem that the type of roll 
of paper which can be used is limited by the type of 
the near end detector built into the printer, even 
though any roll of paper, having a core or not, can be 
used for recording. In particular, for example, when a 
coreless roll of paper is used in a printer having a 
built-in near end detector of the type which detects 
the diameter of the roll of paper, accurate detection 
of the near end state of the roll of paper is not 
possible and the time for loading the new roll of paper 
is therefore often missed. This is because, when the 
amount of paper remaining in the roll becomes small, it 
loosens and the diameter of the roll appears to 
increase, so it is not possible

<CLAIMS>
A device for detecting the near end state of 
a roll of paper (RP), comprising: 


holding means (16,18) for rotatably receiving a 
roll of paper (RP) such that paper can be drawn from 

the roll; 
movable means (24,24a,24b) arranged so as to be 
movable between a first position and a second position 

which is indicative of the near end state of the roll 
of paper, 
resilient means (32) for resiliently biasing said 
movable means (24,24a,24b) towards said second 

position; and 
detecting means (40) for detecting when said 
movable means (24,24a,24b) is in said second position, 
 
   
characterised in that
 said movable means 
(24,24a,24b) comprises a lever element (24) having a 

roll-receiving recess (34) formed therein, which recess 
(34) is defined between a first step portion and a 

second step portion, said first step portion being 
movable towards and away from the pivot point of said 

lever element (24),
 
   wherein, in use, a roll of paper (RP) contacts 

said movable means (24, 24a, 24b) such that the weight 
of the roll of paper (RP) acts against said resilient 

means (32) so that said movable means (24,24a,24b) is 
retained in said first position until, owing to paper 

being drawn from the roll (RP), either (a) the weight 
of the roll (RP) decreases to the extent that the 

resilient means (32) is able to move the movable means 

(24,24a,24b) into said second position, or (b) the 
diameter of the roll (RP) decreases to the extent that 

the roll (RP) is received in said roll-receiving recess 
(34) thereby causing the movable means (24,24a,24b) to 

move to said second position, the position of said 
first step portion relative to the pivot point of the  

 
lever element (24) determining the diameter of the roll 

of paper (RP) at which the roll of paper (RP) is 
received in said roll-receiving recess (34). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, further 
comprising an alarm means for warning that the 

remaining amount of the roll of paper (RP) has reached 
the near end state when the movement of said movable 

means (24,24a,24b) from the first position to the 
second position is detected by said detecting means 

(40).
