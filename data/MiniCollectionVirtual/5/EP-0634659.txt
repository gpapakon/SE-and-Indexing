<ABSTRACT>
A chemical analysis film cartridge (20) has a box-like 

casing body (21) which has first and second end walls (20d,20a) opposed 
to each other and in which a plurality of dry frameless 

chemical analysis film chips (1) are stored in a stack 
extending between the end walls. A first opening (20c) is 

formed in a side wall (20b) of the casing body at a portion 
near to the first end wall (20d) of the casing body so that 

only the film chip nearest to the first end wall in the 
film chips in the stack can be taken out of the casing 

body through the first opening by moving the film chip in 
the direction perpendicular to the direction of the 

stack. A second opening (20e) which permits a suction pad to 
hold the film chip nearest to the first end wall and take 

it out of the casing body through the first opening is 
formed in the first end wall of the casing body. The 

width of the first opening is larger than the thickness 
of one film chip and smaller than double the thickness of 

one film chip at least a part of the first opening. The 
suction pad is retracted with the film chip held on the 

suction means so that the film chip held on the suction 
pad abuts against the edge of the second opening on 

opposite sides of the suction pad and then further 
retracted to pull the central portion of the film chip in 

this state into the second opening, thereby reshaping the 
film chip into a predetermined warped-shape conforming to 

the shape of the first opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cartridge for storing 
a plurality of chemical analysis film chips each in a 
warped or curled state and having a reagent layer 
containing a reagent whose optical density changes 
through a chemical reaction, an immunoreaction or the 
like with a specific biochemical component contained in a 
sample liquid such as blood or urine. This invention 
further relates to a method of taking 
out the chemical analysis film chips from the cartridge 
one by one. Quantitative or qualitative analysis of a 
specific component in a sample liquid is a common 
operation carried out in various industrial fields. 
Especially, quantitative analysis of a chemical component 
or a solid component contained in body fluid such as 
blood or urine is very important in the field of clinical 
biochemistry. There has been put into practice a "dry-to-the-touch" 
chemical analysis slide with which a specific 
component contained in a sample liquid can be 
quantitatively analyzed through a droplet of the sample  
 
liquid applied to the slide by spotting. See 
United States 
Patent No. 3,992,158, 
United States Patent No. 
4,292,272 or the like. When such a dry chemical analysis 
slide is used, the sample liquid can be analyzed more 
easily and more quickly than when the conventional wet 
analysis method is used, and accordingly the dry chemical 
analysis slide is very convenient for medical facilities, 
laboratories and the like where lots of sample liquids 
have to be analyzed. When chemical components or the like contained in 
a sample liquid is quantitatively analyzed using such a 
dry chemical analysis slide, a droplet of the sample 
liquid is applied to the slide and is held at a constant 
temperature for a predetermined time in an incubator so 
that coloring reaction occurs, and the optical density of 
the color formed by the coloring reaction is optically 
measured. That is, measuring light containing a 
wavelength which is pre-selected according to the 
combination of the component to be analyzed and the 
reagent contained in the reagent layer of the slide is 
projected onto the slide and the optical density of the 
slide is measured. Then the component to be analyzed is 
quantitatively analyzed on the basis of the optical 
density using a calibration curve which represents the 
relation between the concentration of the biochemical 
component and the optical density.  
 The chemical analysis slide generally comprises a 
dry chemical analysis film test element, called film 
chip in the following and

A chemical analysis film cartridge comprising a box-like 
casing body (21) having a first and second end walls 

(20a,20d) opposed to each other and in which a plurality of 
dry frameless chemical analysis film test elements (1), each 

comprising a reagent containing layer (3) formed on a 
support sheet (2), are stored in a stack extending between 

the end walls (20a,20d), a first opening (20c) being formed 
in a side wall (20b) of the casing body (21) at a portion 

near the first end wall (20d) of the casing body (21) so 
that only the chemical analysis film test element (1) 

nearest the first end wall (20d) can be removed from the 
casing body (21) through the first opening (20c) by moving 

the chemical analysis film test element (1) to be removed in 
a direction substantially perpendicular to a direction in 

which the test elements (1) are stacked, and a second 
opening (20e) being formed in the first end wall (20d) of 

the casing body (21) so that a film takeout means (70) can 
hold the chemical analysis film test elements (1) nearest 

the first end wall (20d) through the second opening (20e), 
whereby the width of the first opening (20c) in the 

direction in which the test elements (1) are stacked is 
larger than the thickness of one test element (1) and at 

least part of the first opening has a width in the direction 
in which the test elements (1) are stacked smaller than 

double the thickness of one test element (1)
