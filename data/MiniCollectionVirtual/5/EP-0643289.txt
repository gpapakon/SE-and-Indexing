<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an inspection method with which, for each of a number of locations, a spectrum having a number of spectral values is measured. In this arrangement, a collective evaluation of the old spectra is made possible by the following method steps:   a) Formation of a data matrix from the spectral vectors which are formed by the sequence of the spectral values in each case of one spectrum, the spectral vectors being arranged in a location dependent manner in the columns (or in the rows) of the data matrix, b) Singular-value decomposition of the data matrix to obtain three matrices whose product corresponds to the data matrix, of which the first (third) consists of spectrum-dependent vectors, the second is a diagonal matrix and the third (first) consists of location dependent vectors,   c) Evaluation of at least one of the three matrices.

An examination method whereby a respective spectrum with a number of spectral
values is measured for a number of locations,

characterized in that it comprises the following steps:

a) formation of a data matrix (
X
) from the spectrum vectors (X
i
) formed by the series
of spectral values of a respective spectrum, the spectrum vectors being arranged in the

columns (or the rows) of the data matrix in a location-dependent manner,
b) singular value decomposition of the data matrix in order to obtain three matrices
(
U, G, V
T
) whose product corresponds to the data matrix, the first (third) matrix thereof
consisting of spectrally dependent singular vectors (U
j
), whereas the second matrix is a
diagonal matrix (
G
) and the third (first) matrix consists of location-dependent singular
vectors,
c) evaluation of at least one of the three matrices.
A method as claimed in Claim 1,

characterized in that the non-significant elements of the second matrix (
G
) are eliminated as
well as the vectors present in the corresponding columns of the first matrix (
U
) and in the
corresponding rows of the third matrix (
V
T
).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that for the identification of
a substance of known spectrum (R
i
):

a) scalar multiplication is performed for the spectrum vector (R
i
) formed by the
spectral values of this spectrum and the spectrally dependent vectors (U
j
),
b) the associated spectrally dependent vectors (U
j
) are weighted by the coefficient (c
ij
)
produced by the scalar multiplication and subsequently summed,
c) and that the sum vector resulting from the summing operation is compared with the
spectrum vector (R
i
) of the known spectrum.
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that it is used for the detection of
given substances in luggage inspection. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that for the determination of the spatial distribution of substances of known
spectrum:


a) scalar multiplication is performed for the vectors (R
i
) formed by the spectral values
of these known spectra and the spectrally dependent vectors (U
j
), and
b) the spatial distribution of the substances is determined while taking into account
the coefficient (c
ij
) thus obtained as well as the second matrix and the matrix consisting of
the location-dependent vectors.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that for the determination of
the spectrum at least one of several substances whose spatial distribution within the

examination zone is known, the vectors defining the spatial distribution of the individual
substances are subjected to scalar multiplication by the location-dependent vectors, and that

the spectra of these substances are determined from the coefficient thus determined, from
the second matrix and from the matrix containing the spectrum-dependent vectors.
A device for carrying out the examination method claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that it comprises


a) a measuring device (1, 2, 4 ... 10) for measuring a respective spectrum for a
plurality of voxels,
b) means (10, 101) for forming a data matrix (
X
) from the spectrum vectors (X
i
)
formed by the series of spectral values of a respective spectrum, the spectrum vectors being

arranged in the columns (or in the rows) of the data matrix in a location-dependent manner,
c) means (10, 102) for singular value decomposition of the data matrix in order to
obtain three matrices (
U, G, V
T
) whose product corresponds to the data matrix, the first
(third) matrix consisting of spectrally dependent vectors (U
j
), whereas the second matrix is
a diagonal matrix (
G
) and the third (first) matrix consists of location-dependent vectors,
d) means (10, 103 ... 108) for evaluating at least one of the three matrices (
U, G, V
T
