<ABSTRACT>
A first transistor is connected to a second transistor so 
that the first and second transistors may be initially biased 

in a non-conducting state when a first node is at a first 
voltage potential and a second node is at a second voltage 

potential. A potential altering circuit selectively alters 
the voltage potential at the first and second nodes, causes 

the first and second transistors to be in a conducting state 
for accelerating a voltage transistion at the first and second 

nodes toward final values, and maintains the first and second 
nodes at their final voltage potentials for implementing a 

desired Boolean function.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic circuits and, more
particularly, to circuits which implement Boolean functions.Many software and hardware applications require the
implementation of Boolean functions such as AND, OR, NAND,
NOR, EXCLUSIVE-OR, etc. Most Boolean functions may be
implemented by interconnecting a plurality of transistors in
such a way that binary signals representing input values are
applied to control terminals of the transistors and the result
of the logical expression is output from a node somewhere
within the circuit. The circuits are often classified as
static or dynamic. For example, Fig. 1 is a schematic
diagram of a known static circuit 10 for implementing a NOR
function (A+B). Circuit 10 comprises PMOS transistors 14, 18
and NMOS transistors 22, 26. The binary signal representing
the A value is applied to a gate terminal 30 of PMOS
transistor 14 and to a gate terminal 24 of NMOS transistor 26.
The binary signal representing the B value is applied to a
gate terminal 34 of PMOS transistor 18 and to a gate terminal
38 of NMOS transistor 22. A source terminal 42 of PMOS
transistor 14 is coupled to a VDD potential, and a drain
terminal 46 of PMOS transistor 14 is coupled to a source
terminal 50 of PMOS transistor 18 at a node 54. A drain
terminal 58 of PMOS transistor 18 is coupled to an (A+B)
output line 62 at a node 64. Drain terminals 68, 72 of NMOS
transistors 22, 26
respectively are coupled to (A+B) output line 62 at respective
nodes 76 and 78. Source terminals 82, 84 of NMOS transistors
22 and 26 are coupled to a ground potential. From inspection
of circuit 10, it should be readily apparent that when both A
and B are low, then transistors 14 and 18 conduct current into
node 64. At this time transistors 22 and 26 are nonconducting.
Thus, output line 62 is pulled high. On the other hand, if
either A or B are high, then the respective PMOS transistor 14
or 18 is rendered nonconducting. Simultaneously, one or both 
of NMOS transistors 22 or 26 conducts current away from node
64, and output line 62 is pulled low.One problem with circuit 10 is that, since PMOS
transistors are not as conductive as NMOS transistors for a
given size, PMOS transistors 14 and 18 typically must have a
considerably larger size than transistors 22 and 26. Not only
does this consume valuable chip area, but the logic elements
which generate the A and B signals must therefore drive more
input capacitance. Another problem, shared by all static
circuits of this type (and those described below), is that
