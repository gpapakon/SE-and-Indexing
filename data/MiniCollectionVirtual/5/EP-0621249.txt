<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to water-in-oil emulsion 
explosives in which an oxidizing material is contained in 

the discontinuous water phase, and the continuous oil phase 
acts as a carbonaceous fuel. More particularly, this 

invention relates to such explosives in which 
polyfunctional carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, or 

phosphorous-containing acids, soluble in the oil phase, are 
caused to cross-link using an inorganic cross-linker, 

thereby causing the viscosity of the emulsion to 
increase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water-in-oil emulsion
explosives in which an oxidizing material is contained in
the discontinuous water phase, and the continuous oil phase
acts as a carbonaceous fuel. More particularly, this
invention relates to such explosives in which poly-functional
carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, or
phosphorous-containing acids, soluble in the oil phase, are
caused to cross-link, by an inorganic cross-linker, thereby
causing the composition to increase in viscosity. Often the
viscosity increase is sufficient to cause the composition
to set to a rubbery consistency.Water-in-oil explosive emulsions typically comprise a
continuous organic phase and a discontinuous oxidizer phase
containing water and an oxygen-supplying source such as
ammonium nitrate, the oxidizer phase being dispersed
throughout the continuous organic phase. Emulsion
explosives are known to those skilled in the art. Cap-sensitive
explosive emulsions are water-in-oil explosive
emulsions which can be detonated without the use of a
booster. Such emulsion explosives are also known to those
skilled in the art.U.S. Patent 3,130,096 discloses a propellant
composition in which a mixture of diglycidyl ethers is
cured to form a binder which is admixed with an oxidizing
material. The binder also functions as a fuel.U.S. Patent 3,177,101 discloses a gas-generating
composition proposed by mixing a carboxyl terminated liquid-polyester
with ammonium nitrate powder and a curing agent.
The curing agent reacts with the carboxyl portion of the
liquid polyester, and the material sets to a solid
consistency. The patent distinguishes between- gas-generating
compositions, propellants, and explosives by
noting that gas-generating compositions have a 
substantially lower burning rate than conventional
propellants, just as propellants have a substantially lower
burning rate than explosives.U.S. Patent 3,790,416 discloses a composite propellant
composition in which dewetting of the propellant
composition under applied stress is substantially reduced.
Reduced dewetting is achieved through the use of poly-functional
amines which are capable of forming a chemical
bond between the oxidizer (oxygen-containing ammonium salt)
and the binder in the cured propellant. The composite
propellant composition comprises oxidizers and optionally
fuels in the form of small solid particles uniformly
distributed in a polymeric binder.U.S. Patent 4,104,092 discloses gelled explosive
compositions which are sensitized with water-in-oil
explosive emulsions. The gelled
