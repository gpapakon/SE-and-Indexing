<ABSTRACT>
2-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (R-1122) is removed from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a) by contacting the R-134a in the vapor phase with chlorine in the presence of ultraviolet light providing an exposure of at least about 2 watts-hour/kg.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates principally to the 
purification of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, also 
designated R-134a, which has been of particular interest 
as a replacement for chlorofluorocarbons having similar 
physical properties, particularly R-12. R-134a may be 
prepared by reaction of other fluorocarbons, such as 
trichloroethylene or R-133a (2-chloro-1,1,1-tri 
fluoroethane) with HF. It may also be prepared by 
hydrogenation of R-114a (2,2-dichloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) 
or R-124 (2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). It is characteristic of such reactions that 
many by-products are formed, containing varying numbers 
of hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine atoms on methane, 
ethane, and ethylene molecules. These by-products and 
the unreacted feed material may be separated by 
distillation where possible. Some compounds are 
relatively harmless since their presence does not greatly 
alter the physical properties for which HFC-134a is 
useful. A by-product which must be removed because of 
its toxicity is 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (R-1122), 
although only relatively small amounts are typically 
present in R-134a as formed. R-1122 has a boiling point 
close to that of R-134a making them difficult to separate 
by distillation. After distillation of the crude 
product, R-1122 will still be present in amounts from 
500 to 10,000 ppm (wt.). It should be reduced to 
below 10 ppm according to the specifications of the Panel 
for Advancement of Fluorocarbon Test (PAFTII). 
Preferably, the R-1122 should be below about 1 wt. ppm. US-A-3,819,493 discloses an 
extractive distillation process for separating 1,1-difluoroethane 
(R-152a) from R-134a produced by  
 
electrochemical fluorination of R-152a. The two 
compounds have a low relative volatility and saturated 
hydrocarbons having 4-10 carbon atoms are added to 
increase the relative volatility and facilitate their 
separation. US-A-4,129,603 removes R-1122 by 
contacting impure R-134a with an aqueous solution of a 
metal permanganate. The R-134a is derived from the 
reaction of HF with a haloethane such as 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane 
over a chromium oxide or fluoride 
catalyst. A different approach to removing R-1122 from R-134a 
is shown in US-A-4,158,675. The 
reaction producing R-134a takes place at temperatures in 
the range of 325° to 375°C in the presence of a chromium 
oxide or fluoride catalyst, the effluent 
of the reaction is passed into a second reactor containing a 
chromium catalyst but operated at 100° to 275°C.

A process for removing 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (R-1122) and 
other unsaturated compounds from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a)

(a) contacting a mixture consisting substantially of R-134a and up to 
10,000 wt. ppm R-1122 with 1 to 50 mols of chlorine for each mol of

wt. ppm, by converting said R-1122 to 1,2,2-trichloro-1,1-difluoroethane
