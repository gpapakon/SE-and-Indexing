<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing diamond semiconductor 
mainly composed of carbon, a technique is provided which is 

free from the possibility of destruction of diamond 
structure, permits n-type doping into diamond and further 

permits high concentration n-type doping. 
In this method of diamond semiconductor manufacture, 
lithium atoms (which may be produced from a nitrogen 

compound of lithium, for instance lithium azide) is doped 
using ECR plasma into diamond (102) with the surface thereof 

having been cleaned, if necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a diamond 
semiconductor device in accordance with the precharacterizing 
part of claim 1. Such a method is known e.g. from EP-A-0 
543 392. There were attempts to artificially synthesize diamond in 
old days, and in 1960s it became possible to successfully synthesize 
diamond even under low pressures. Up to now, it has 
become possible to manufacture thin films of diamond under 
pressure close to vacuum. This has led to extensive attempts 
to obtain diamond semiconductor from thin film diamond and 
produce semiconductor devices by using such diamond 
semiconductor. Compared with silicon, diamond has the following 
characters. 
(1) Its carrier mobility is much higher so that its 
operation speed is several times than that of silicon. (2) Its band gap is 5.5 eV wide, and thus it is capable of 
operation without destruction at an overwhelmingly high 
temperature of 700°C compared to silicon. (With silicon, a 
trend of operation state deterioration arises at around 
150°C.)  
 (3) It resists radiation. Particularly, 
it is less subject to software error due to radiation 
which is a problem in the super LSI. This means that it 
can be used even in bad environments. Thus, it is expected 
to be used in stringent environments such as center 
space or places around a nuclear reactor. Such 
applications can not be expected with silicon. For practical use of diamond semiconductor, however, 
there are problems to be solved such as follows. 
(1) There still is no process of inexpensively growing 
single crystal thin film. (2) It is impossible to obtain n-type doping. (3) There still is no practically estabilished etching technique 
for designing complicated circuits. Particularly, the problem in (2), i.e., impossibility 
of n-type doping, is a fatal one in the device production, 
which is very serious for the future practical use of 
diamond semiconductor. This point will be described in further detail. 
Diamond itself is generally very inferior in the doping 
efficiency when it is used as semiconductor material. For 
example, the carrier concentration that is obtainable by a 
p-type semiconductor with 1,000 ppm of boron is only about 
10E16 cm-3.  
 Further, the constituent element of diamond is carbon, 
with its atomic diameter being small compared to silicon or 
the like. Therefore, it is impossible to use for the n-type 
doping such element as phosphorus which is used in the 
silicon process, and it is inevitable to use nitrogen with 
the atomic diameter close
