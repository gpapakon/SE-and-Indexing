<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to integrated circuit chip testing. 
Typically, integrated circuit chips are attached to a chip 
carrier, thermally conductive module chip carrier, circuit 
card or board, e.g., by solder bonding, brazing, controlled 
collapse chip connect, wire lead bonding, metal bump bonding, 
tape automated bonding, or the like. For the first time since 
the wafer was diced, the chip is tested, e.g., electrically 
tested and logically tested. Some of the tests are subtle, 
for example tests for active and passive pattern faults and 
"stuck at 1" or "stuck at 0" faults. When a fault is found, 
the chip is removed from the card or board. This is not a 
simple "desoldering" step, especially in the case of high I/O 
density integrated circuit chips, bonded with encapsulation 
chip connect technologies, and usually present in multi-chip 
modules. This is because when a chip is found to be 
defective, it must be removed, the chip site redressed, and a 
new chip installed for testing. In the case of a polymeric 
substrate, redressing the chip site might include milling. The chip tester of the present invention substantially reduces 
the need for expensive rework. According to the method of the 
invention, there is provided a method of testing semiconductor 
chips. The individual semiconductor chips have I/O, 
power, and ground contacts. In the method of the invention a 
test fixture system is provided. The test fixture system 
includes a dedicated fixture just for testing chips, a chip 
insertion tool, a chip positioning tool, and a chip removal 
tool. The functions of the individual tools, that is, the chip 
insertion tool, the chip positioning tool, and the chip 
removal tool, may be combined into a smaller set of tools. 
This chip test fixture system has contacts corresponding to 
the contacts on the semiconductor chip. The carrier contacts  
 
are low electrical contact resistance contacts adapted for 
holding the integrated circuit chip in place during testing, 
with low impedance, while allowing easy removal of the chips 
after testing. According to the invention the test fixture contacts have 
dendritic surfaces. By dendrites are meant essentially 
vertical members extending outwardly from a generally planar 
area of electrically conductive material. The dendrites, 
produced by a columnar growth process, generally have an 
aspect ratio, of vertical to horizontal dimensions, of at 
least about 1.0, a height above the planar area of 
electrically conductive material of about 10 to 100 
micrometers
