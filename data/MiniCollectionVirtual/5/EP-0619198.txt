<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle roof in which the sun visor (8) is formed as a light blocking layer on the under surface of the glass cover (1). The cover lies immediately adjacent a closure plate (10) which is displaceably guided on a cover or border frame (4). The light blocking layer is created as a lattice pattern by the application of a coloured layer produced by silk screen printing. Light can be admitted or blocked out by an appropriate adjustment of the closure plate relative to the lattice.

Vehicle roof comprising a glass lid (1), which completely
fills a roof opening in a closed position, is adjustable for at

least partly exposing the opening, and is provided with a
sunshield (8) firmly attached to its inner face, which

sunshield possesses a series of uniformly spaced light
apertures (9) and with which is associated a closure plate (10)

constructed as a slider, which is guided parallel to the
sunshield (8) at mutually opposite guides and is provided with

closure portions (12) for completely or partly closing the
light apertures (9) of the sunshield (8) as desired and with

openings (11) alternating with them, which openings can be
completely or partly aligned as desired with the corresponding

light apertures (9) of the sunshield (8) by sliding the closure
plate (10), characterized in that the sunshield (8) is

constructed as an opaque coating on the lower surface of the
glass lid (1), formed as a coloured coating applied by screen

printing, against which the closure plate (10), which is
slidibly guided on the lid frame (4), directly bears, and in

that the closure plate (10) is made from a thin, resiliently
flexible material.
Vehicle roof according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the coloured coating applied by screen printing to form the

sunshield (8) is applied simultaneously with the decorative
frame (7), usual with glass lids (1), extending around the lid

flush with its edge, concealing functional elements from
outside and printed onto the lower face of the glass lid (1),

the internal area of the pane enclosed by the decorative frame
(7) being completely filled by the sunshield (8).
Vehicle roof according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the lid frame (4) possesses, internally on its front

transverse member (13) and its two lateral longitudinal members
(14), a continuous seating groove (15), immediately adjacent to

the glass pane (2) and its coating, for the associated outer
edges of the closure plate (10) slidably guided therein. 
Vehicle roof according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the closure plate (10) is inserted with

its two lateral edges, after resilient bending, into the
lateral seating groove portions (15) of the lateral

longitudinal members (14) of the lid frame (4), the distance
between the front transverse member (13) and the rear

transverse member (16) of the lid frame (4) beneath the glass
pane (2) being larger than the length of the closure plate (10)

in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle by the play
necessary for the fitting of the closure plate (10).
Vehicle roof according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, on the front transverse member (13) of

the lid frame (4), a drive apparatus (17) for the sliding of
the closure plate (10) in the longitudinal direction of the

vehicle is mounted, the apparatus consisting of a circular
drive disc (20), journalled rotatably but axially immovably in

a casing (18) and provided with a downwardly pointing handle
(19), which disc possesses, on its upper face, an eccentrically

mounted, upwardly projecting entraining pin (21), which
slidably engages into a slit of the closure plate (10),

orientated transversely to the longitudinal direction of the
vehicle.
Vehicle roof according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the slit for the engagement of the entraining pin (21) is one

of the openings (11) of the closure plate (10).
Vehicle roof according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that the light apertures (9) in the sunshield
(8) are fully closed by the closure portions (12) of the

closure plate (10) when the closure plate (10) is pushed fully
home into the seating groove portion (15) of the front

transverse member (13) of the lid frame (4), but are fully
opened when the closure plate (10) is pushed fully home against

the rear transverse member (16) of the lid frame (4).
