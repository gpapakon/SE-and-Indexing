<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic injection molding
and, more particularly, to plastic injection molding
wherein an article having a hollow rib portion is produced
thereby according to the precharacterising part
of claims 1 and 8.This application is related to US Patents Nos. 4 781
554; 4 855 094; 5 028 777, 5 069 859 and 5 098 637, all
of which have the same Assignee as the Assignee of
the present invention, constituting the prior art of which
this invention is an improvement.In the plastic injection molding art, the usual challenges
facing a product designer are to design an article
having requisite strength for the product application and
uniform surface quality for satisfactory appearance, but
to avoid excessive weight, material usage and cycle
time. A design compromise must often be made
between strength and plastic thickness. A relatively
thicker plastic section in the article, such as a structural
rib, will incur greater weight, material usage, cycle time
and induce sink marks and other surface defects due to
thermal gradients in the area of the thickened section.It is known in the plastic molding art to use pressurized
fluid in conjunction with the plastic molding of articles.
The pressurized fluid is typically nitrogen gas
which is introduced into the mold cavity at or near the
completion of the plastic injection. The pressurized fluid
serves several purposes. First, it allows the article so
formed to have hollow interior portions which correspond
to weight and material savings. Second, the
pressurized fluid within the mold cavity applies outward
pressure to force the plastic against the mold surfaces
while the article solidifies. Third, the cycle time is
reduced as the gas migrates through the most fluent
inner volume of the plastic and replaces the plastic in
these areas which would otherwise require an extended
cooling cycle. Fourth, the gas pressure pushes the plastic
against the mold surfaces, thereby obtaining the
maximum coolant effect from the mold.However, as the dimensions of the molded artide
increase, the gas must do more work to migrate through
the volume of the mold cavity to assist in setting up the
artide within the cavity. If the pressure of the gas is too
great as it enters the mold cavity, there is a risk that it
may rupture or blow out the plastic within the mold cavity,
i. e. , the gas is not contained within the plastic.
Thus, there have been practical limitations in the adaptation
of gas injection in the plastic molding field.It is important to ensure that the maximum gas

A process for injection molding a hollow plastic article (82, 84) comprising the steps of:

injecting a quantity of fluent plastic into a mold cavity (68) including a channel (66) having a
shape defining a rib portion (72, 86, 88) of the article (82, 84);
displacing a portion of the plastic from the channel (66) of the mold cavity (68) into a spill
cavity (73) flow coupled to the channel (66) by introduction of a charge of pressurized gas

into the channel (66) of the mold cavity (68) to thereby form a gas passage (70) in the rib
portion (72, 86, 88),
permitting the injected plastic to solidify;
venting the gas from the mold cavity (68); and
removing the plastic article (82, 84) from the mold 
characterized by
 the channel (66) being
tapered outwardly toward the spill cavity (73) at an angle sufficient to permit the charge of

pressurized gas to travel the entire length of the channel (66) to form the gas passage (70)
so that the gas passage (70) is substantially uniform in cross section along the entire length

of the channel (66).
The process of claim 1 
characterized by
 the mold
cavity (68) including a space (74) defining at least

one solid wall portion (78, 80) of the article (82, 84)
flow coupled to the channel (66) wherein the thickness

of the channel (66) in cross section is at least
twice as large as the thickness of the space (74) in

cross section along the entire length of the channel
(66) so that the thickness of the solid wall portion

immediately above the rib portion (86, 88) is sub-stantially
equal to the thickness of the rest of the

solid wall portion (78, 80).
The process of claim 1 
characterized by
 the rib
portion being an external rib portion.
The process of claim 1, 
characterized by
 the rib
portion being an internal rib portion (86, 88).
The process of claim 2 
characterized by
 the space
(74) defining two wall portions (78, 80) of the article

(82, 84) and wherein the internal rib portion (86, 88)
interconnects the two wall portions (78, 80).
The process of claim 1 
characterized by
 the angle
being approximately 0.25 degrees.
The process of claim 1 
characterized by
 the quantity
of fluid plastic being pressurized and wherein

the process further comprises the step of depressurizing
the fluid plastic after the step of injecting to

facilitate the displacement of the portion of plastic
into the spill cavity (73).
Apparatus for injection molding a hollow plastic article
(82, 84), the apparatus comprising:


a mold having a mold cavity (68) including a
channel (66) having a shape defining a rib portion

(72, 86, 88) of the article (82, 84) and a
spill cavity (73) coupled to the channel (66);
means (26) for injecting a quantity of fluent
plastic into the mold cavity (68); and
means (32) for introducing a charge of pressurized
gas into the channel (66) of the mold cavity

(68) to displace a portion of the plastic from
the channel (66) of the mold cavity (68) into the

spill cavity (73) to thereby form a gas passage

characterized
by
 the channel (66) being tapered out-wardly
toward the spill cavity (73) at an angle

sufficient to permit the charge of pressurized
