<ABSTRACT>
In a common drive output circuit for driving dissimilar switching 
semiconductor devices having different drive input characteristics by 

turning on and off dc power supplies to apply a voltage between the drive 
input terminals of either one of the switching semiconductor devices through 

two transistors connected in a Darlington pair, the collector circuit of one 
of the two transistors which is not at the output stage has a diode inserted 

in series which has such a polarity as to permit passage of the collector 
current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive circuit
for use with voltage-driven semiconductor devices such as
IGBTs (insultated-gate bipolar transistors) and power MOS
FETs. The present invention also relates to a common
output circuit for driving dissimilar switching
semiconductor devices (power devices) having different
drive input characteristics that are respectively
composed of the IGBTs and the MOS FETs.Power devices are usually driven with different
circuits having configuration adapted for the drive input
characterestics inherent in the individual devices.Figs. 1(A) and 1(B) illustrate the drive input
characteristics of two dissimilar power devices; Fig. 1(A)
shows illustrative waveforms of the base-emitter voltage
VBE of a bipolar transistor and the corresponding base
current IB, and Fig. 1(B) shows illustrative waveforms of
the gate-emitter voltage VGE of an IGBT and the
corresponding gate current IG. Fig. 2 shows a circuit for
driving the bipolar transistor and Fig. 3 shows a circuit
for driving the IGBT. The circuit shown in Fig. 2 includes a bipolar
transistor QB as the power device to be driven, a forward
drive dc power supply VCC, a reverse drive dc power supply
VEE, a forward drive output stage transistor QF, and a
reverse drive output stage transistor QR.When a "High" ("H") drive signal VD is supplied,
it is inverted by a NOT gate N1 and turns one photocoupler
PC1 on while turning the other photocoupler PC2 off. As a
result, a base current is supplied to the forward drive
output stage transistor QF through the path consisting of
dc power supply VCC, phototransistor PD1 in photocoupler
PC1, the base-emitter of output stage transistor QF, the
base-emitter of bipolar transistor QB and dc power supply
VCC, and output stage transistor QF is thus turned on
whereas the other output stage transistor QR for reverse
drive is turned off. Hence, a base current IB1 as a
forward drive current is supplied to bipolar transistor QB
through the path consisting of dc power supply VCC,
forward base current limiting resistor RF, the collector-emitter
of output stage transistor QF, the base-emitter of
bipolar transistor QB, and dc power supply VCC, and the
bipolar transistor QB is thus turned on.If the drive signal VD is at a "Low" ("L") level,
photocoupler PC1 turns off and photocoupler PC2 turns on.
As a result, the forward output stage transistor QF is 
turned off and a base current is supplied to the reverse
drive output stage transistor QR through the path
consisting of dc power supply VEE, the
