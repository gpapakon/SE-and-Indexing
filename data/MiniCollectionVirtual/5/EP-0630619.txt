<ABSTRACT>
1. A trocar (402) for placement in the lumen of a cannula to facilitate 
inserting the cannula through the wall of a body cavity, the trocar 

comprising a handle (127), an obturator (432) with a point (124) for 
piercing the wall of the body cavity, and a sensing means (441) which 

advances distally relative to the handle after the trocar point has penetrated 
through the wall of the body cavity; characterised by: means (427) within 

the handle to retract the obturator relative to the handle, automatically upon 
the distal advancement of the sensing means, whereby the obturator is no 

longer exposed to body tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical instrument
for piercing or puncturing a wall of body tissue to provide
communication with the inside of an anatomical cavity.
More particularly, but not exclusively, this invention
relates to a powered trocar with a safety feature for
preventing the unintended puncturing of body tissue.
communication with the inside of an anatomical cavity, and
more particularly this invention relates to a powered trocar
with an optional safety feature for preventing the
unintended puncturing of body tissue.Many medical procedures gain access to the inside
of an anatomical cavity by using an implement such as a
trocar, cannula or needle having a sharpened point to pierce
or puncture the bodily tissues, muscles and membranes
forming the cavity wall. A surgical needle, for example,
connected to a catheter may be used to pierce a cavity
(blood vessel, subarachnoid space, heat ventricle). After
piercing the cavity, the needle is left in situ and used to
inject or withdraw gaseous or liquid phase fluids from the
cavity. Similarly, in several endoscopic procedures, a
small incision may be made in the skin of a patient along
the abdomen for example, and the sharp point of a larger
penetrating implement such as a trocar of suitable length
and diameter is inserted into the incision, and pushed until
the point punctures the cavity wall. Then, a sleeve follows
the implement into the puncture wound to preserve the shape
of the passageway created by the implement. After the
sleeve is in place, the implement may be withdrawn and an
endoscope and operating instruments may be inserted via the 
sleeve to view and operate upon organs within the cavity.
Endoscopic instruments are those instruments having a
relatively narrow and elongated portion for use in
endoscopic surgical procedures wherein such instruments
create or are inserted through a small diameter puncture in
order to carry out surgical procedures within a human or
animal body.Penetrating the wall of an anatomical cavity with
a surgical puncturing instrument can be quickly done and,
usually creates a small neat passageway providing
communication to the interior of the cavity. While the
sharp point of a penetrating implement is being pushed
through a cavity wall, it encounters great resistance from
the tissue, muscle and membranes forming the cavity wall.
Once the sharp point and blade of the implement pass through
the cavity wall and into the cavity, the resistance drops
significantly. The sharp point of the implement, however,
can easily

<CLAIMS>
A trocar (102) for placement in the lumen of a cannula to facilitate inserting the
cannula through the wall of a body cavity, the trocar comprising a handle (127), an

obturator (122, 332, 432), a tip (124) with a point for piercing the wall of the body
cavity, and a sensing means

(130, 124, 316, 441) which advances distally relative to both the handle and the tip
after the trocar point has penetrated through the wall of the body cavity; characterised in that it

further comprises means (154, 327, 427) within the handle to retract the obturator
relative to the handle, automatically upon the distal advancement of the sensing

means, whereby the obturator is no longer exposed to body tissue, and in that a
fixture (124, 333) is provided for mounting the tip (124) to the obturator.
A trocar according to claim 1, wherein the retracting means comprises resilient
biasing means (154, 227, 327, 427) to retract the obturator.
A trocar according to claim 2, and including
means (218) for releasably securing the obturator from proximal retraction

under the bias of the biasing means; and
means (216) for releasing the releasable securing means in dependence

upon a proximal retraction of the sensing means that occurs while the trocar
is advancing through the wall of the body cavity, and the subsequent distal

advancement of the sensing means that occurs after the cannula has
penetrated through the wall of the body cavity.
A trocar according to any one of the preceding claims and further
comprising means (136, 228a, 343, 442) for triggering the retracting means

upon the distal advancement of the sensing member. 
A trocar according to claim 4 wherein the means for triggering the
retracting means is actuated by a successive proximal then distal movement

of the sensing means, namely, the proximal retraction of the sensing means
that occurs while the trocar is penetrating the wall of the body cavity, and

the subsequent distal advancement of the sensing means that occurs after
the cannula has penetrated through the wall of the body cavity.
A trocar according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
sensing means is resiliently biased (138, 229, 319, 445) distally.
A trocar according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
sensing means comprises a sleeve (130, 316) around the obturator (122,

332).
