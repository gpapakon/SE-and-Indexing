<ABSTRACT>
The system includes a network of neural operators (HOP1, ..., HOP4) which is controlled by a supervisory unit (1). The activities computed by the operators are stored in associated memory spaces (MU1, ..., MU4) which are addressable by an activity address. In order to facilitate the reconfiguring of the network, the memory space of at least some of the operators contains the activity addresses of other operators in the network. Thus, the input activities of these operators may arise from any other operators modifiably by simply changing the values of the activity addresses. Application in particular to image and sound analysis and synthesis.

each neural operator (OPv
c
r) being designed to perform a
multi-linear function relating to at least one input

vector ([F(Ivr)]) made up of several input variables,

said function defining an activity (Fv

input signals of the system or activities of other

network operators, said system having storage means (MU1,
..., MU4) which can be addressed by said control unit (1)

and organised in a plurality of storage areas associated
respectively with said operators (OPvr), said system

being characterised in that each storage area contains at
a given address, referred to as activity address (Ivr),

a value representative of the activity (Fvr
c

associated operator (OPv

r) and in that for at least one
sub-set of the other network operators said associated

storage spaces also contain the addresses (Ivr) of the
activities making up the input vectors ([F(Ivr)]

A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said network is organised on several levels (H1, ...,

H4), each level (Hv) having a group (HOPv) of operators

storage spaces of the operators of said group and at
least a first communication bus (Bv) linking said

operators (OPvr) to said memory module and in that said
network incorporates links (BL1, ..., BL4) allowing

communication between the control unit (1) and each of
said first communication buses (B1, ..., B4).
A system as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
each level (Hv) has addressing means (BCv, CUv) capable

of addressing the activities ([F(Ivr)]) of the operators

(OPvr) of the other levels after reading the activity
addresses (Ivr) contained in the memory module (MUv) of

said level.
A system as claimed in one of claims 2 or 3,
characterised in that said multi-linear function is the

scalar product of said input vector (F(Ivr)]), either by

vector of coefficients ([Gvr

operator (OPvr
c

A system as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that
the operators (OPvr) of said sub-set and belonging to the

same level (Hv) are linked to one another, and each of
said operators (OPv
c
r

the scalar product of an input vector by a vector of

coefficients has learning means (AE, AS) to correct said
vector of coefficients ([Gvr

operators (OPv

r) of the same level.
A system as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that
the operators of the sub-set consist of an input

processor (PE) and an output processor (PS), said input
processor (PE) is linked at the input to the fi

coefficients ([Gvr

of other levels and transmit said scalar product to a
second communication bus (b) and said output processor

(PS) is linked at the input to said second communication
bus (b) in order to calculate its activity defined as the

scalar product ((Fv
c
r
c

([gvr

the activities of other input processors (PE) of the same

A system as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that
the learning of an input processor (PE) consists in

causing a correction ([dGvr

one output processor (PS) of the same level exceeds a

given threshold, said correction being proportional to

A system as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that
the learning of an output processor (PS) consists in

defining for each activity component (fv

r) of said second
activity vector ([fv
