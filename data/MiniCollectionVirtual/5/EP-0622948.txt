<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for recording an image on a recording medium
on the basis of input data.As conventional non-impact type printers using an
electrophotographic process, a laser printer using a
laser diode, an LED printer using a light-emitting
diode array as a light source, a liquid crystal printer
using a liquid crystal shutter, and the like are known.
Of these printers, some laser printers which can change
a density of dots of an image to be output can change a
dot density using a signal from an external apparatus
or a select switch.However, when a dot density is merely changed, an
image is nonuniformly formed or reproducibility of a
detailed portion is considerably degraded.Printers such as a laser printer utilizing an
electrophotographic technique process a binary image
signal. When these printers output a halftone image,
an image signal is subjected to processing such as
dither processing by a host computer and is converted
to a binary signal before it is input to the printer. 
As a method of inputting multi-value image data to
a laser printer or the like and outputting a halftone
image, a method wherein an input image signal is
converted to an analog image signal, and the analog
image signal is compared with a cyclic analog pattern
signal such as a triangular-wave signal, thus
generating a pulse-width modulated binary image signal,
is proposed (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai)
No. 62-42693).Fig. 22 is a block diagram showing an arrangement
of the apparatus according to this method.Multi-value image data sent from a host computer
(not shown) is subjected to digital-to-digital
conversion by a D/D converter 202 for density
correction, and is then latched by a latch circuit 203
in response to an image clock signal CLK, thus
synchronizing timings. The latched image data is
converted to an analog signal VA by a D/A converter
204. The analog signal VA is compared by a comparator
205 with a triangular wave having a predetermined
period, which is output from a triangular wave
generating circuit 219. Thus, the analog signal is
converted from a level signal to a time modulation
signal, i.e., a pulse-width modulated signal. The
pulse-width modulated output from the comparator 205 is
input to a laser driver 206, thus driving a laser diode
207. In conventional apparatus, the resolution of a
halftone image (to be referred to as the number of lines)
is determined in accordance with the obtainable
resolution of the printer.However, when an output image of a printer is
