<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to release coatings.
In particular, the present invention relates to release
coatings which anchor toner.A number of conventional electrophotoconductive
devices such as printers and copiers employ dry toner.
These printers and/or copiers employ toner to form a
latent image transferable from an imaging device to a
substrate such as paper, tag or label stock. The toned
latent image is then subjected to heat fusing in order
to obtain the best print quality and toned image
density.Although the resulting images are often of good
quality, there are problems associated with the imaging
processes employed by printers and/or copiers. For
example, there is the problem of backgrounding which is
the accumulation of various unwanted materials such as
toner particles on the substrate. Backgrounding can
occur when the imaging device evenly disperses toner
particles over a non-imaged area of the substrate.Additional backgrounding problems can be
experienced when label stock is utilized. Label stock
comprises one or more non-continuous substrates
referred to as labels which are adhered by an adhesive
to a protective backing or liner. To permit the label
to be removed from the protective liner, it is
customary to coat a release coating over the liner in
order to permit ready separation of the two members.Although the release coating permits ready
separation, detrimental backgrounding problems can be
experienced when a partially used sheet of label stock
is repassed through an electrophotoconductive printing
device. Usually after the first printing, one or more 
labels are removed thereby exposing the release coating. Thus,
backgrounding occurs not only on the label, but also upon exposed release
coating. The toner will not anchor to conventional silicone release coatings
due to the fact that these coatings have a different polarity than do the toner
particles and because the silicone coatings have much lower glass
transition temperatures than the toner particles. Therefore, the unwanted
particles which are dispersed on the release coating tend to flake off the
coating, then transfer to rollers found in printers and then possibly, relocate
themselves to the succeeding labels or sheets.World Patent Application No. US/90/03286 (Josephy et al.) describes
a toner receptive coating which can be applied to compressible substrates
such as paper. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,492,410 (Fitch et al.) describes
a toner receptive coating applied to substrates such as paper. However,
neither of these two
