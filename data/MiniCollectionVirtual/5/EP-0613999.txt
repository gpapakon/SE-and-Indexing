<ABSTRACT>
Air inlet conduit system for internal combustion engines with spiral individual inlet conduits (9) which emanate from a manifold pipe of very large volume formed by mating parts (4, 5). The proposal is therefore that at least one of the mating parts (4, 5) should be designed as a vacuum accumulator (15) which is connected via a non-return valve (18) to the inlet manifold conduit (6) and, by means of vacuum connections (19), via vacuum lines, to the corresponding pneumatic elements of the engine or vehicle equipment.

<CLAIMS>
Air inlet conduit system for internal combustion engines, 
with a centrally arranged inlet manifold and individual inlet 

conduits which lead from the latter in the form of spirals to 
the cylinders and are formed from two sub-pieces which are 

assembled and connected by way of sealing surfaces extending 
in the axial direction of the spirals, wherein the walls of 

the individual inlet conduits which are on the inside in 
relation to the inlet manifold and the wall of the inlet 

manifold are formed by adapters which, starting from the 
sealing surfaces, are inserted in the sub-pieces, 

characterised in that at least one of the adapters is formed 
as a vacuum store which can be connected to the inlet manifold 

(6) via a non-return valve (16) and to the corresponding 
pneumatic elements of engine or vehicle fittings via vacuum 

lines by way of vacuum connections (19). 
Air inlet conduit system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the vacuum store is a blow moulded part 

(15) or a component which is composed of a plurality of 
pressure die castings and connected in an airtight manner.
