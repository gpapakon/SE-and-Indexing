<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to fire-fighting equipment having at least one hydraulic accumulator as a drive unit for extinguishing liquid. Drive gas (9) drives liquid (10) out of the accumulator (1) through an inner tube (5) which has at least one aperture (7; 8) in its wall. When the liquid level (11) in the accumulator reaches the wall aperture (7), drive gas flows into the liquid flow in the tube (5) to boost the liquid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire-fighting 
equipment comprising a drive unit for extinguishing liquid. The use of at least one hydraulic accumulator, with a 
high initial charge pressure, as a drive unit for 
extinguishing liquid in fire-fighting equipment has been 
suggested in WO92/22353, which is prior art under the 
provisions of Article 54(3) EPC. SU-A-1225585 discloses a fire extinguisher comprising 
a cylinder partly filled with a fire extinguishing fluid 
and maintained under pressure by a halon-type propelling 
gas. The cylinder includes a pipe which extends from the 
bottom thereof and is connected to a nozzle. The pipe has 
several ports formed therein at such a position so as 
initially to be under the fluid level. With use of the 
fire extinguisher the fluid level falls and reaches the 
ports, at which point propelling gas enters the pipe 
through the ports and a fluid and gas mixture exits the 
nozzle in the form of a spray. SU-A-1674865 discloses a high pressure liquid supply 
device which includes a bottom level transducer in each 
container and a compression collector hydraulically linked 
via a non-return valve to the water supply collector. This 
connection prevents brief loss of pressure in the 
compression collector so that there is no break in liquid  
 
supply on switching from one container to another. A high initial charge pressure means in this context 
in general at least about 30 bar, but charge pressures of 
up to about 300 bar may well be considered. Known hydraulic accumulators have a liquid space and 
a gas space separated from each other by a membrane. A 
relatively large portion of the volume of the hydraulic 
accumulator remains unutilized and, in addition, the 
penetration power of the liquid spray is reduced over a 
relatively long period when the hydraulic accumulator is 
being discharged at a reduced drive pressure. The aim of the invention is to provide new fire-fighting 
equipment with an improved hydraulic accumulator 
enabling more efficient fire-fighting. Accordingly, the present invention provides fire-fighting 
equipment, comprising a drive unit for 
extinguishing liquid, said drive unit comprising at least 
one hydraulic accumulator means which is chargeable to a 
high initial drive pressure, and which is arranged at a 
high drive pressure to deliver liquid and at a reduced 
drive pressure to deliver a mixture of liquid and gas, the 
accumulator means comprising a liquid space and a gas 
space; characterized in that the liquid space and the gas 
space

<CLAIMS>
Fire-fighting equipment, comprising a drive unit for 
extinguishing liquid, said drive unit comprising at least 

one hydraulic accumulator means (61) which is chargeable to 
a high initial drive pressure, and which is arranged at a 

high drive pressure to deliver liquid and at a reduced 
drive pressure to deliver a mixture of liquid and gas, the 

accumulator means (61) comprising a liquid space (62) and 
a gas space (63); characterized in that the liquid space 

(62) and the gas space (63) communicate with outlet valve 
means (64) and an outlet line (65), wherein the outlet 

valve means (64) is responsive to drive pressure in the 
liquid space (62) of the accumulator means (61) in such a 

way that the outlet valve means (64) is arranged to open 
only a liquid outlet connection (67a-73-65) at a high 

pressure in the liquid space (62) of the accumulator means 
(61) and to open an additional gas outlet connection (68a-80-79-73-65) 

at a reduced pressure in the liquid space (62) 
of the accumulator means (61). 
Fire-fighting equipment according to claim 1, wherein 
the liquid space (62) and the gas space (63) are not 

divided from each other by means of a membrane. 
Fire-fighting equipment according to claim 2, wherein 
the outlet valve means (64) comprises a valve spindle (71), 

a valve pin (76), and a spring (72) arranged between the 
valve spindle (71) and the valve pin (76), whereby the  

 
force of the spring (72) is arranged to open the additional 

gas outlet connection (68a-80-79-73-65) by moving the valve 
spindle (71) in relation to the valve pin (76) when the 

pressure drops from the high pressure to the reduced 
pressure. 
Fire-fighting equipment according to claim 3, further 
comprising a manually operable handle (70) for opening and 

closing the outlet valve means (64). 
Fire-fighting equipment according to claim 1, wherein 
the gas (81) intermixed with liquid is arranged to be 

driven out through the outlet line (65). 
Fire-fighting equipment according to claim 1, wherein 
the gas (81) is arranged to be driven out through a 

separate inner line (82) in the outlet line (65).
