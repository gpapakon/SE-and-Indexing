<ABSTRACT>
A pacemaker or other cardiac stimulation device (10) is configured
to predict the onset of vasovagal syncope and administers pacing therapy

to prevent the syncope from occurring. Prediction of the onset of
vasovagal syncope is based upon an analysis of the contractility of the

heart muscle. In an example described herein, the contractility of the
heart muscle is detected and compared with the average contractility. If

the current contractility exceeds the average contractility by a
predetermined threshold, a high risk of vasovagal syncope is thereby

detected and the heart is paced at a vasovagal syncope prevention rate
which may be, for example, 20 to 40 beats per minute faster than a

previous heart rate. The contractility of the heart is determined, for
example, by measuring the impedance of the heart tissue or by

measuring the movement of heart tissue in the wall of the heart or by
pressure using an accelerometer. The contractility is averaged over a

period of time to determine the average contractility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to cardiac pacing techniques and in
particular to techniques for preventing vasovagal syncope using cardiac
pacing.Syncope is a sudden loss of strength or consciousness caused by
reduced cerebral circulation, itself typically the result of vasodilation.
Vasovagal syncope is a type of syncope referred to as a
neurocardiogenic syncope wherein the syncope is triggered by an
interaction between the heart and nerve tissue connected to the heart.
Neurocardiogenic syncope may also be referred to as neuromediated
syncope, neurally mediated syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope,
cardioneurogenic syncope, vasodepressor syncope, malignant vasovagal
syndrome, neurally mediated hypotension/bradycardia and cardiovascular
neurogenic syncope. For vasovagal syncope, the interaction occurs
between the heart and the vagus nerve.Evidence suggests that vasovagal syncope is initially triggered by
a sudden reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, perhaps resulting
from stress, pooling of blood in the extremities, or other factors. As a
result of the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, the pressure of
blood entering the heart drops and the amount of blood filling the
ventricles prior to ventricular contractions therefore also drops. With less
blood in the ventricles, the ventricles thereby contract much more quickly
and vigorously than would otherwise occur in an effort to maintain a
constant stroke volume. The more vigorous ventricular contractions have
the effect of stimulating ventricular mechanoreceptors, also known as C
fibers, that normally only respond to ventricular expansion or stretching,
rather than contraction. The activation of the ventricular 
mechanoreceptors results in a surge in neural traffic to the brainstem,
particularly to the nucleus tractus solitaries, via the vasovagal nerve.For most people, the neurological system properly interprets the
increase of activity of the mechanoreceptors as being in response to a
drop in peripheral vascular resistance and compensates by increasing the
heart rate and constricting the blood vessels. However, in certain
patients, as a result of a neurological condition within the vagus nerve or
for some other reason, the surge in neural traffic is falsely perceived by
the neurological system as being representative of hypertension. In
response thereto, the brainstem triggers an increase in peripheral
vasodilation and a reduction in heart rate. The vasodilation and the drop
in heart rate, in turn, cause a still further reduction in blood

<CLAIMS>
A system in an implantable device for detecting the possible
onset of vasovagal syncope within a patient, the system comprising:


an input circuit for receiving a signal representative of the
contractility of the heart of the patient; and
a controller for determining, based on the detected
contractility, whether there is a significant risk of the onset of

vasovagal syncope.
The system of Claim 1, wherein the input circuit receives a
signal representative of at least one of the contractility of the ventricles of

the heart of the patient, electrical blood impedance, heart wall
acceleration or blood pressure within the left ventricle.
The system of Claim 1, wherein the controller determines an
average contractility value of the heart, stores the average contractility

value, compares a current value for the contractility of the heart to the
average contractility of the heart stored in the memory register, and

determines whether there is a significant risk of the onset of vasovagal
syncope based upon the comparison of the current value of the

contractility to the average value.
The system of Claim 1, further including a pulse generator
and wherein the controller, upon detecting a significant risk of the onset of

vasovagal syncope, controls the pulse generator to generate pacing
pulses for applying to the heart so as to reduce the likelihood of the

vasovagal syncope.
The system of Claim 4, wherein the controller:
incrementally increases a pacing rate from a preexisting
pacing rate to a predetermined vasovagal syncope prevention rate

during a first predetermined on number of beats;
maintains the pacing rate at the predetermined vasovagal
syncope prevention rate during a second predetermined on

number of beats; and
incrementally decreases the pacing rate from the vasovagal
prevention rate to the preexisting pacing rate during a third

predetermined on number of beats.
The system of Claim 5, wherein the first, second and third
predetermined period of times are in the range of 3 to 5 seconds, 30 to

180 seconds, and 10 to 30 seconds, respectively.
The system of Claim 5, wherein the vasovagal syncope
prevention rate is in the range of 20 to 40 beats per minute above the

preexisting pacing rate.
The system of Claim 5, wherein the preexisting pacing rate
is a predetermined base pacing rate.
The system of Claim 5, wherein the preexisting pacing rate
is a sensor responsive pacing rate.
A method for use in an implantable device for detecting the
possible onset of vasovagal syncope within a patient comprising the steps

of:

detecting the contractility of the heart; and
determining, based on the detected contractility, whether
there is a significant risk of the onset of vasovagal syncope.
