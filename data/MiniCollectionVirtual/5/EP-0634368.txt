<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a plant for biologically treating hot industrial wastewater (effluent). In the prior art, there have been various problems with such processes and plants, since, in particular, the necessary cooling of such industrial wastewaters necessitates highly complex technology and correspondingly high costs. The invention provides a remedy by the chemical compounds being degraded in a culture medium at t DEG  
>
 60 DEG C under anoxic conditions and with the use of thermophilic denitrifiers in the form of microorganisms, nitrate/nitrite, as H acceptor, being added externally or used as the efflux of a conventional nitrification plant and being provided as an upstream denitrification reactor. Suspension reactors and biofilm reactors are considered to be suitable for carrying out the degradation process.

Process for the direct biological treatment of hot industrial waste water 
or its partial flows containing readily degradable, highly volatile and/or 

high molecular weight, organic-chemical and/or inorganic compounds, characterized 
in that the chemical compounds are degraded un
der anoxic conditions and 
using thermophilic denitrifying bacteria in the form of microorganisms in a 

culture medium (biomass) between 
>
 60° and 80°C, nitrate or nitrite being 
externally dosed in as the H-acceptor or use is made of the outlet of a conventional 

nitrification plant of a further purification stage. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that as microorganisms use 
is made of aerobic or optionally anaerobic bacteria as biomass having their 

optimum t 
>
60°. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the thermophilic 
denitrifying bacterial strain used is Bacillus thermodenitrificans (DSM No. 

465, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen GmbH, Meschroder Weg 1B, 38124 
Braunschweig). 
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that sewage, activated 
and/or excess sludge is used as the culture medium and H-donor for 

performing the denitrification, whilst raising the sludge hydrolysis speed at 
elevated temperature (t° 
>
60°C) in the same denitrification reactor. 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that a partial flow of hot industrial waste water at a temperature of approximately 

90 to 110° is cooled to approximately 60°C and higher by adding and 
mixing with a partial flow of nitrate and/or the outflow from the nitrification 

stage. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it 
is performed continuously or as a batch process, the biomass being in suspended 

form or as a biofilm (fixed or fluid bed type) in the closed reactor. 
Installation for performing the process according to claim 1, characterized 
by the following features:
  
 

a suspension or biofilm reactor (10 or 12) comprising
 
an inlet and outlet (14, 16) for the industrial waste water and optionally 

sewage sludge and the like, as well as an inlet (18) for nitrate dosing,
 
an insulation,
 
a stirrer (20),
 
a thermostat (22) with temperature measurement and indication (23),
 
a cooling device (24) for the produced, escaping gas,
 
a return line (26) for the discharged gas, which is connected to the bioreactor 

(10, 12), accompanied by feeding in via nozzles (28),
 
a line (32) leading from the cooling device (24) to a gas collecting container 

(30),
 
and in which in the suspension bioreactor (10) in the discharge line (34) is 

provided a microfiltration device (36), which is connected by means of a 
line (38) to the inlet (18) for nitrate dosing. 
Installation according to claim 7, characterized in that there is a 
redox and/or pH-value measurement and indicating device (40) in or on the 

bioreactor (10, 12). 
Installation according to claim 7, characterized in that there are 
devices for establishing the oxygen need (CSB, BSB) of the waste water in the 

inlet (14) and/or the TOC values in the inlet and outlet (14, 16).
