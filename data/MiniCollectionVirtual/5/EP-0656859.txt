A package to contain and display containers or the like requires the smallest possible quantity of packaging material and can easily be disposed of while at the same time facilitating an acceptable display of the product is to be produced with a cardboard sheet which has, on the side, at least one stamped out or unfoldable holder for the container on the inside bounded by fold or stamping lines suited to the shape of the container to secure it. At least one tongue hinged on a fold line can be folded out into the support and swings out when the container is inserted, and a pivoted foot applied to the sheet. This is achieved in that the pivoted foot is formed by a lower region (29) of the sheet (1) which can be folded back and has at least one edge securing cut-out (31, 32) in which the at least one tongue (20, 21) folded out into the support (2) can engage.
