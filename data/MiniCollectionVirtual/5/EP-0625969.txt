<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a new class of
arylalkoxyphenoxy-imidazoline compounds possessing
therapeutic properties. Therein, another aspect of the
invention is directed to a method of use of these compounds
for the treatment of depression, anxiety, hypertension,
and migraine headaches. A further aspect of the invention
is directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing these
arylalkoxyphenoxy-imidazoline compounds.In EP-A 423 802 phenoxy-heterocyclic compounds and their use as antidepressants, anxiolytics and antihypertensive agents are disclosed. Eur. J. Med. Chem 26, 207-213 (1991) discloses fenmetazole analogues, including compounds having a phenoxy moiety in the 2 position.In accordance with the present invention, a new class
of arylalkoxyphenoxy-imidazoline compounds have been
discovered which can be described by the following formula
(Formula 1):
 
wherein;

also be represented by the pharmaceutically compositions or
acceptable addition salts thereof. It is further
understood that any one or more preferred groups may exist
together in combinations forming a more preferred grouping
of the claimed compounds.Preferred groups of the claimed compounds, but not
limited to, are such that
