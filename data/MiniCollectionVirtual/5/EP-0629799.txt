<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas or liquid seals and, 
more specifically, to gas or liquid compliant seals for sealing 
high pressure areas from low pressure areas. Many classes of machinery use clearance seals internally to 
seal against gas pressure. Often these seals are simple 
labyrinth seals which break down pressure by using a series of 
teeth or blades in close proximity to a rotating shaft. Such 
devices are well known and reliable, but allow high rates of gas 
leakage. Typically, clearances between the blade tips of a 
labyrinth seal and the shaft are as high as 0.001 - 0.002 inch 
per inch of shaft diameter, depending upon the class of machine 
being sealed. As an example, for a 6.00 inch diameter shaft, the 
radial clearance between the shaft and blade tip could be 0.006 - 
0.012 inch on a typical centrifugal gas compressor. Some of the classes of rotating machinery which use 
labyrinth seals include centrifugal gas compressors, gas 
turbines, steam turbines, gas expanders and turbofan engines. 
Seal sizes range from less than one inch up to several feet 
diameter for large machines. Pressures on centrifugal gas 
compressor labyrinth seals range from less than one hundred PSIG 
to as high as 1500 PSIG at the balance diameter location.  
 
Temperatures on these machines go up to 500°F. Surface speeds go 
as high as 500 fps on typical gas compressors. Much work has been done to reduce the leakage of labyrinth 
seals. Typically, the approach of past efforts has been directed 
toward improved blade geometry (e.g., backward angled blade 
designs), step seals, or interlocking blade designs to reduce 
losses. Abradable labyrinth seal designs have also been 
developed and are employed, particularly, on jet engines. The 
blades of such abradable seals are initially installed with a 
line-to-line clearance, and then wear in to their own clearance 
as the shaft rotates. However, after the rotor has gone through 
an operating history of radial vibration combined with axial 
excursions, a crescent-shaped clearance is often cut into the 
abradable seal, and leakage can increase dramatically. In spite 
of many improved designs, therefore, leakage losses for labyrinth 
seals continue to represent a considerable energy loss in rotating 
machinery. Another significant problem with high pressure labyrinth 
seals is the occurrence of rotordynamic effects. Because high 
pressure gas is quite dense, a labyrinth seal tends to act as a 
bearing with high gas pressures, but also tends to destabilize 
the rotor
