<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to turbine nozzles therein. In a gas turbine engine, a combustor discharges hot combustion gases downstream 
through a high pressure (HP) stationary or stator turbine nozzle which directs the flow 
between rotor blades of a high pressure turbine (HPT) for extracting energy therefrom. The 
HPT may have a second stage of rotor blades disposed downstream from the first stage 
with an additional, second stage turbine nozzle disposed therebetween for channeling the 
combustion gases from the first stage rotor blades to the second stage rotor blades. The HP first stage turbine nozzle and the second stage turbine nozzle each include 
a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart stator vanes or airfoils joined at their radially 
outer and inner ends to annular outer bands. The nozzles are typically made in arcuate 
segments with arcuate outer and inner band segments each having one or more vanes per 
segment. The segments are conventionally joined together to collectively form a complete 
360Â° turbine nozzle. The HP stage one nozzle is typically supported in the engine at both its outer and 
inner bands for accommodating loads thereon including pressure forces from the 
combustion gases channeled between the vanes. However, the second stage nozzle is 
supported solely at its outer band since a conventional annular seal member is disposed 
between the first and second rotor stages preventing stationary support of the inner band 
as well. Accordingly, the vanes of the second stage nozzle are cantilevered from the outer 
band support which creates bending moments due to the combustion gases flowing 
between the vanes which must be suitably reacted or accommodated through the outer 
band. Since the HP stage one nozzle is supported at both its inner and outer bands, it may 
be relatively simply manufactured by brazing the vanes at their outer and inner ends to the 
respective outer and inner bands. However, braze joints have acceptable shear strength but  
 
undesirable bending strength. Since the HP nozzle is supported at its outer and inner bands, 
bending moments from the combustion gases are insignificant, whereas the bending 
moments in the second stage nozzle are significant since it is supported solely at its outer 
band, with the inner band thereof being unsupported. Accordingly, brazed turbine nozzles are typically not used where they cannot be 
supported at both their outer and inner bands which, therefore, requires
