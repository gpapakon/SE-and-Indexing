<ABSTRACT>
The optical fibre network according to the invention is a distribution network in which in each case only three optical fibres are connected to one another at active or passive distribution points (A, B). The distribution points are designed in such a manner that they in each case provide for bidirectional transmission in three ways. Subscriber facilities (F) are connected or can be connected to arbitrary points of the optical fibres of the network. To increase the operational reliability, an optical fibre ring line (50) exists to which the ends of the optical fibres forming a distribution network can be connected via controllable optical switches (D).
