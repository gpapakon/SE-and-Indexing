<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum alloy 
support for planographic printing plate and more particularly 
relates to an aluminum alloy support which is superior in an 
electrolytically graining property. Furthermore, the present 
invention relates to an aluminum alloy support for 
planographic printing plate which does not soften easily even 
when a burning treatment is conducted after development of a 
coated photosensitive layer. As an aluminum alloy support for printing plate, 
particularly for offset printing plate, there is used an 
aluminum plate (including aluminum alloy plate). In general, an aluminum plate to be used as a support 
for offset printing plate needs to have a proper adhesion to 
a photographic light-sensitive material and a proper water 
retention. For these purposes, the aluminum alloy support is 
subjected to a surface treatment such as a graining process 
and an anodizing process. The graining process is conducted to make the surface 
of the aluminum alloy plate uniform and finely grained. This 
graining process largely affects a printing performance and a 
durability of the printing plate upon the printing process 
following manufacture of the plate. Thus, it is important  
 
for the manufacture of the plate whether such graining is 
satisfactory or not. In general, an alternating current electrolytic 
graining method is used as a method of graining an aluminum 
support for a printing plate. There are a variety of 
suitable alternating currents, for example, a normal 
alternating waveform such as a sinewaveform, a special 
alternating waveform such as a squarewaveform, and the like. 
When the aluminum support is grained by alternating current 
supplied between the aluminum plate and an opposite electrode 
such as a graphite electrode, this graining is usually 
conducted only one time, as the result of which, the depth of 
pits formed by the graining is small over the whole surface 
thereof. Then, the durability of the grained printing plate 
during printing results in insufficient. Therefore, in order 
to obtain a uniformly and closely grained aluminum plate 
satisfying the requirement of a printing plate with deep pits 
as compared with their diameters, a variety of methods have 
been proposed as follows. One method is a graining method to use a current of 
particular waveform for an electrolytic power source (JP-A-53-67507). 
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application".) Another 
method is to control a ratio between an
