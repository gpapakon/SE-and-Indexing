<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diene based, epoxidized star
polymers suitable for cross-linking and adhesive, sealant and
coating compositions made therefrom.High molecular weight conjugated diene based styrenic block
copolymers, such as S-I-S, S-B-S, S-EP-S and S-EB-S block
copolymers, are extensively used as base polymers in the
formulation of many types of hot melt applied coatings and
adhesives. These materials offer advantages over other types of
materials such as acrylic oligomer/acrylic monomer and
polyol/isocyanate monomer systems that are applied as 100% reactive
systems and are cured by chemical or radiation means. An important
advantage of the high molecular weight diene based styrenic block
copolymers is the ability to provide non-polluting formulations and
method of application that employs very benign raw materials,
compared to the substantial risk associated with acrylate and
isocyanate monomer based 100% reactive systems.However, an important limitation of the styrenic block
copolymers has been the inability to provide formulations with
solvent and higher temperature resistance. This is because the
styrenic block copolymers rely on physical association of the
polystyrene blocks in the polymer for cross-linking and once the
polystyrene domains in the polymer are weakened by solvent takeup
or temperatures near or above the glass transition temperature of
the polystyrene, cohesive strength is lost. This problem has been
solved by the preparation of very high molecular weight block
copolymers, which can undergo covalent cross-linking by EB
(Electron Beam) radiation to reinforce the physical cross-linking
to give improved solvent and heat resistance. Another important
limitation of the styrenic block copolymers is related to the
otherwise very desirable hot melt application method. Many
substrates cannot tolerate being exposed to hot melt temperatures, 
150 °C to 230 °C, without being severely damaged. This is
the case for very thin polyolefin films, such as thin
polyethylene film.The present invention provides relatively high
molecular weight conjugated diene based polymers having a
very compact star structure with short arms which lowers
the viscosity. These polymers do not have a distinct
styrene block which would tend to raise application
viscosity. The polymers of this invention have many of
the property advantages of conventional styrenic block
copolymers, including being safe to handle and being
covalently cross-linkable for solvent and high
temperature resistance. Additionally, the
