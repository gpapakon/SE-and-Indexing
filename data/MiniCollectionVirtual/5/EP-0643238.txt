A reversible, hydraulically damping mount with a 
carrier bearing and with a support bearing which are 

supported one on the other in an elastically resilient 
manner by mea
ns of a carrier spring made of elastomeric 
material, comprising at least two fluid-filled working 

chambers which are arranged in succession in the direction 
of the vibrations introduced as a consequence of 

operation and which are limited on the sides facing one 
another by a common partition and are connected to one 

another in a fluid-conducting manner by means of at least 
one damping duct arranged in the partition, the partition 

having a central recess which forms an integral part of 
a passage orifice, the passage orifice is to be opened by 

means of an actuator of a regulating device, said 
actuator being capable of being loaded by pressure 

medium, characterized in that the passage orifice (10) 
has a meander-like cross-section extending in the radial 

direction. 
A mount according to claim I, characterized in 
that the passage orifice (10) is limited by the partition 

(7) and the actuator (11), in that the recess (9) is 
surrounded concentrically by an annular groove (13) open 

in the direction of the actuator (11), and in that the 
actuator (11) is made pot-shaped with an edge (14) 

projecting axially in the direction of the partition (7) 
and the axial limitation of the edge (14) can be sealingly 

closed, if required, by means of the groove bottom 
(15) of the groove (13). 
A mount according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the actuator (11) has a sealing 

face made of elastomeric material. 
A mount according to either of claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the pot-shaped actuator (11) is 

provided with a vibratable base made of elastomeric 
material, and in that the base is designed as a 

switchable central diaphragm (16). 
A mount according to any of claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterized in that the actuator (11) and the central 
diaphragm (16) can be loaded by pressure medium only 

jointly and can be actuated synchronously. 
A mount according to any of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the sealing face and the central 

diaphragm (16) are designed to merge into one another in 
one piece. 
A mount according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the partition (7) is made two-part 

in the axial direction and is perforated in a lattice-like 
manner and surrounds an annular diaphragm (17) only 

in the region of the lattice-like structure. 
A mount according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that, when the actuator (11) is not 

loaded by pressure and with the passage orifice (10) 
closed, the central diaphragm (16) and the annular 

diaphragm (17) are assigned to one another in a functional 
parallel connection. 
A mount according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, when the actuator (11) is loaded 

by pressure, the passage orifice (10) has an identical 
passage cross-section along its entire extent. 
A mount according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the actuator (11) and the central 

diaphragm (16) can be loaded pneumatically by a pressure 
which falls below the atmospheric pressure.
