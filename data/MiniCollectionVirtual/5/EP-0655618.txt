<ABSTRACT>
A method of analyzing a metal-containing sample by 
secondary ion mass spectrometry for the determination of the 

concentration of the metal is disclosed. The material is 
first formed into a solution and a drop thereof is placed 

onto an electrically conductive surface of a supporting disc. 
After drying, the resulting solid layer on the supporting 

disc is subjected to a secondary ion mass spectrometric 
analysis. When the sample is a liquid, the liquid may be 

directly placed on the supporting disc. This technique is 
applicable for the preparation of a standard sample having a 

known composition of metals and used for constructing a 
calibration curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of analysing a
metal component-containing sample for the determination of
the concentration of the metal by secondary ion mass
spectrometry and to a method of preparing a standard sample
for use in such a secondary ion mass spectrometric
analysis.Ion mass spectrometric analysis has been applied to a
variety of solid materials such as films, metals and dusts.
In this technique, a sample is bombarded with an ion beam
of, for example, 5-15 keV Ar+, to cause neutral atoms and
ions to be ejected from the sample. These secondary
positive ions are extracted into a mass spectrometer and
analyzed. Details of this technique are disclosed in, for
example, Morrison, G. H. et al, Analytical Chemistry, 47,
933 (1975) and Ishizuka, T., Analytical Chemistry, 46, 1487
(1974).The conventional method using the secondary ion mass
spectrometry has a problem because it is not applicable to
the analysis of an insulating sample. While incorporation
of carbon into the sample can solve the problem of static
charging, another problem then arises because the carbon
adversely affects the resolution of the mass spectrum. The
conventional method poses a further problem because the
intensity of the secondary ion varies when the sample is
not homogeneous. This will be easily appreciated since the
sample is bombarded with a micro beam. Additionally, in
the conventional method, a relatively large amount of a
sample is required.In order to obtain exact quantitative analytical data
by secondary ion mass spectrometric analysis, it is
necessary to prepare a calibration curve using a standard
sample having a known composition. No satisfactory method
is, however, known in the art which can prepare a desired
standard sample matching a sample to be measured.A paper by Davis et al in Analytical Chemistry, Vol.
55, 1983 pages 1302-1305 describes the use of secondary ion
mass spectrometry to identify the presence of alkaloids in 
plant materials. The samples were dissolved in either
methanol or water and deposited for analysis on a silver or
platinum foil, excess solvent being removed by gentle
heating.The present invention has been made in view of the
above problems.There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the
present invention a method of analysing a solid, metal
component-containing material by secondary ion mass
spectrometry for the determination of the concentration of
said metal, comprising the steps of:
(a) mixing said material with an aqueous liquid to
dissolve said metal component in said liquid
