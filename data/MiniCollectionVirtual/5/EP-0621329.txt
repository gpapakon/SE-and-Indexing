a slightly soluble calcium or magnesium compound comprising the 
steps of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to removing fines from a spent 
aqueous drilling fluid which is being used in drilling a borehole 
in an underground formation to obtain a well in the formation. 
During drilling of a borehole in the formation drill cuttings 
accumulate in the aqueous drilling fluid. The larger particles can 
be removed by so-called shale shakers, and the smaller particles 
can be removed by hydrocyclones and decanting centrifuges. Other 
methods involve adding to the spent aqueous drilling fluid chemical 
flocculation agents to settle out the fines at surface, or diluting 
the spent aqueous drilling fluid with water to reduce the concentration 
of fines. See, for example, Development in Petroleum 
Science, 11, Drilling and Drilling Fluids, G.V. Chilingarian and P. 
Vorabutr, Elsevier, 1981, page 309-310. A disadvantage of adding chemical flocculation agents is that a 
relatively large amount of flocculation agent is required, and a 
disadvantage of diluting the aqueous drilling fluid is that other 
drilling fluid components such as materials to increase density, 
organic polymers and mud-conditioning agents have to be replenished. A further method to remove clay particles from spent aqueous 
drilling fluid comprises adding calcium chloride to an aqueous 
solution of colloid clay particles, see Composition and Properties 
of Oil Well Drilling Fluids, 4th Edition, G.R. Gray and H.C.H. 
Darley, page 164-167. Applicant has found that this method cannot be applied in case 
the drilling fluid contains a viscosifier in the form of a water-soluble 
polymer, as this water-soluble polymer remains dissolved in 
the aqueous phase and, as a consequence, the fluid is too viscous 
to allow separation by means of centrifuging.  The aqueous drilling fluid for which the present invention has 
been developed also contains a salting-out anion. These salting-out 
anions decrease the temperature at which the water-soluble polymer 
starts to precipitate (see Lyotropic Numbers of Anions From Cloud 
Point Changes of Nonioninc Surfactants, H. Schott, Colloids and 
Surfaces, 11 (1984), pages 51-54). An example of a salting-out 
anion is the formate ion which also increases the transition 
temperature of a biopolymer, see European patent application 
publication No. 259 939. It was found that to obtain flocculation the aqueous drilling 
fluid should contain a slightly soluble calcium or magnesium 
compound, wherein the expression "slightly soluble" is used to 
indicate that the solubility of the compound in water at
