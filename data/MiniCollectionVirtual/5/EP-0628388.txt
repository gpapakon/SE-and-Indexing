<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus serves for making building blocks, in particular paving stones, blocks and form blocks, and has a material box (4), a mould box (5), a vibrating arrangement and compacting rams (6). Fastened on a main frame (1) are main cylinders (2), to the main pistons of which, which operate in the vertical direction, the mould box (5) is fastened via a supporting frame (11). The compacting rams (6) are arranged under the mould box (5) and the mould box (5) is detachably connected, rotatably by at least approximately 180@ about a horizontal axis, to the height-adjustable supporting frame (11) via a suspension arrangement. The supporting frame (11) is connected to the main frame (1) or the material box (4) displaceably parallel to the axis of rotation of the mould box.

An apparatus for producing blocks, in particular paving 
stones, bond stones and formwork blocks, having a 

material box (4), a moulding box (5), a jolting device 
and having compacting plungers (6), with main cylinders 

(2) being fixed to a main frame (1), to the main pistons 
(3) of said cylinders, which operate in the vertical 

direction, the moulding box is fixed via supporting frame 
(11), with the compacting plungers being disposed beneath 

the moulding box and with the moulding box being 
detachably connected via a suspension device to the 

height-adjustable supporting frame rotatably by at least 
approximately 180Â° around a horizontal axis,
characterized in that
 at least one supporting frame (11) 
is horizontally displaceably connected to the main frame 

(1 ) or the material box (4), parallel to the axis of 
rotation of the moulding box (5). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 at least one supporting frame (11) 
is connected via a sliding guide device (14, 15) to the 

main frame (1) or the material box (4). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the sliding guide device comprises 
at least one supporting plate (16) securely connected to 

the main frame (1) or the material box (4) and one 
sliding plate (14) displaceable in relation to the 

supporting plate (16) parallel to the axis of rotation of 
the moulding box (5), which sliding plate is connected to 

the main cylinder (2).  
 
An apparatus according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the supporting plate (16) and 
the sliding plate (14) are connected to one another 

via a dovetail guide device. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
 the sliding plate (14) can be 
fixed by a locking device (17, 18) in relation to 

the supporting plate (16), with the locking device 
comprising at l
east one locking lever (17) and one 
locking screw (18). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 at least one hydraulic device 
(19) disposed on the main frame (1) is provided for 

the displacement of the supporting frame (14). 
An apparatus according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the hydraulic device comprises 
a hydraulic cylinder (19), the piston (20) of which 

acts on the sliding plate (14). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 7,
characterised in that
 the slide plate (14) consists 
of a lower part (14B) and an upper part (14A) 

connected thereto via rubber-metal connections (15), 
with the upper part (14A) being securely connected 

to the main cylinder (2). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 the suspension device for the 
moulding box (5) comprises supporting bushes (21) 

disposed on opposite sides on the moulding box (5), 
which cooperate with locating bolts (22) fixed to 

the supporting frame (11).  
 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that
 a mobile moulding box carriage 
can be disposed beneath the moulding box (5).
