<ABSTRACT>
A stem 
for total hi
p prosthesis of straight axis constructed with 
a material of exceptional bio-compatibility and high 

resistance against fatigue such as Ti-6Al-4V alloy and 
introduced in a modular system, which due to its advanced 

design presents a geometrical shape of excelent stability 
in the reconstruction of the articulation of the hip. This 

stem has a coating of inlayed poropatite (porous coating + 
hydroxyapatite) and with support collar at the calcareous. 

Thus making possible the surgical technics of the same to 
be simple and precise, using instrumentation corresponding 

to the hip modular system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new 
prototype of a straight non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis with inlayed coating and support collar at 
calcareous. A good hip prosthesis not only has to comply a 
series of basic principles, but it has to have a simple 
and accurate technic. In this manner, technical errors 
which limit the life of the prosthesis are avoided. Comparing the modular prosthesis object of the 
present invention with those existing at present one comes 
to: The mechanical and physical benefits in an 
implant have great importance, for example, in table I it 
can be observed, from the different employed materials in 
surgical implants, that the highest levels of hardness 
correspond to titanium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V).

elastic limits in the Ti alloy mean that with iqual 
cross-sections the elastic behaviour of Ti alloy is 
produced in a lager field of tensions, that is, the values 
of tensions which produce in Co-Cr-Mo and AISI 316 LVM 
permanent deformations, do not produce the same in 
Ti-6Al-4V and the latter will continue an elastic 
behaviour, that is, it recovers theoriginal dimensions 
thereof. The great difference between the bone 
elasticity modules and the AISI 316 LVM y Cr-Co-Mo,  
 
involves that for a given pressure, the bone will suffer 
different deformations than that of the prosthesis 
involving the danger of loosening of the latter inside the 
bone, which could give way to resorption of the bone or 
necrosis. The difference between the bone and the 
Ti-6Al-4V is approximately half by reducing considerably 
the mentioned risk, in addition, this proximity between 
modules of elasticity implies that the system 
bone-prosthesis can flex more degrees than other alloys 
for a determined tension and therefor reduces the tension 
transferred to the bone. Resistance to the fatigue is an important 
characteristic of the raw material which is used in an 
implant, especially if it will be subjected to cyclic 
charges.

<CLAIMS>
Straight non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, characterized in being constituted by a neck 

zone with a European morse cone 12-14 which permits 
accepting femoral heads of various sizes and lengths, 

providing the same a modular character, a second proximal 
zone of forced adjustment of implant-bone with 

cross-sections of constant thickness and an 
inclination-broadening at a lateral zone. This broadening 

may present two ends at a rear proximal part thereof, 
bevelled at 15º or in straight shape; and a third distant 

zone of rounded end. 
Staright non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, according to claim 1, characterized in that at 

the neck zone, the cervical-dyaphisary angle is similar to 
the anatomic angle, preferably between 135 and 145 

degrees. 
Staright non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, according to calim 1, characterized in that at 

the neck zone a support collar is medially extended having 
an angle of preferably between 25 and 35 degrees form a 

horizontal plane thus permitting a good access in the case 
of revision. This support of small inclination preserves 

more the cortical bone. 
Straight non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, according to claim 1, characterized in that 

the neck zone has an elongated groove combined with a 
threaded orifice for taking out-implanting and orientation 

of the stem. 
Straight non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, according to claim 1, characterized in that at 

the proximal zonethereof it has an inlayed coating 
preferably of poropatite (coating pore+hydroxypatite), 

another one which may be on the basis of titanium spheres 
only, of hydroxypatite or of polymethilmetalcrylate 

(PMMA), situated at the calcareous triangle with the 
exception of the latteral zone, which is optimum for 

stimulating osseous growth of the methaphysary zone of the 
femur. 
Straight non-hardened stem for total hip 
prosthesis, according to claim 1, characterized in that 

its distant zone is tapered (trunco-conical) at an end 
thereof, having a high conicity, and grooved with 

anti-rotation grooves, which eliminate the concentration 
oftensions at said distant part of the stem and thus 

permits a more normal degree of vascularization, 
facilitating the insertion of same in the femur and avoids 

pain located at the distant zone which present other stems 
without said conocity.
