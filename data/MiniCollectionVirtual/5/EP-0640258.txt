<ABSTRACT>
An SAW reflector (302) structure located between multiple interdigitated generator/receivers located on a piezoelectric substrate (100) forming a ladder type SAW device is described. The reflector structure reduces both reflections due to mechanical-electrical loading from the physical presence of generator/receiver fingers without using a split finger arrangement as well as reflections due to the regenerated reflection from the generator/receiver. The reflector has a first acoustic phase center. The generator/receiver has a second acoustic phase center, a regenerated voltage coefficient of reflection r?e? and a mechanical-electrical loading coefficient of reflection r?m?. The reflector is used for simultaneously reflecting both regenerated and mechanical-electrical loading induced reflections from the generator/receiver. The reflector is sized for a strength of reflection equal to the square root of the sum of the regenerated and mechanical-electrical loading reflections squared. The reflector's phase center is positioned an integral number of acoustic wavelengths from the phase center of the generator/receiver plus (or minus) a distance equivalent to a phase angle given by 90 degrees plus the inverse tangent of the ratio of the mechanical-electrical loading reflection to the regenerated reflection times a wavelength dependent proportionality factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface acoustic wave (hereinbelow abbreviated 
SAW) device that can be used as a SAW filter or a delay line, etc. SAW devices having interdigital transducers have been described in many 
publications. Generally, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device, such as a delay 
line, comprises a transmitting (launching) and a receiving transducer placed 
on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. The transmitting transducer uses 
voltage variations derived from input radio frequency electromagnetic signals 
to induce mechanical flexures of the atoms along the surface of a piezoelectric 
substrate, thereby creating surface waves having acoustic properties. The 
substrate supporting the surface waves is generally made of a piezoelectric 
material such as quartz SiO₂, lithium niobate LiNbO₃, lithium tantalate LiTaO₃, 
bismuth germanium oxide Bi₁₂GeO₂₀ or other similar substances. The surface 
waves thus created travel along the surface of the substrate at speeds ranging 
from about 3159 meters per second for Quartz and 3992 meters per second 
for lithium niobate to as slow as 1830 meters/second for bismuth germanium 
oxide. The voltage induced surface waves travel away from the transmitting 
transducer along the surface of the substrate until they reach the receiving 
transducer. The receiving transducer performs the inverse function of the 
transmitting transducer, that is, it converts the arriving surface waves on the 
substrate surface to a voltage resembling the one originally impressed on the 
transmitting transducer. Ideally, the function of above described SAW structure is to recreate a delayed, 
but undistorted copy at the receiving transducer of the original voltage 
waveform convolved with the designed impulse response of the SAW device. 
However, because of reflections arising from the interaction of various structures 
associated with the transmitting and receiving transducers, a faithful, 
undistorted convolution of the original waveform with the impulse response is 
not achieved at the receiving transducer. There are two types of reflections referenced in the present invention that 
interfere with the recreation of the desired output signal. A first type of reflection  
 
is due to the physical presence and dimensional extent of multiple 
fingers of interdigitated transducer structures interacting with the surface of 
the piezoelectric substrate. The presence of the transducer structure and its 
edges causes undesired, interfering reflections related to the geometric
