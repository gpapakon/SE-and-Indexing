<CLAIMS>
Screw clamp (51) with a longitudinal beam (52, 72) that has a circular cross-section 
corresponding to the holes (9) drilled in a table or a similar object and 

with a screw spindle (57) located on a transverse beam (53, 73) for the precise 
setting and application of the clamping force, 
wherein
 the transverse beam 
(53, 73) consists of two parts, an outer support pipe (54) and an inner beam 

(55) provided inside the support pipe (54) in such a way that it can be moved 
longitudinally, which supports the screw spindle (57), and 
wherein
 the 
transverse beam (53) is fixed to the end of the longitudinal beam (52) and 

forms an obtuse angle of about 100Â° with the latter. 
Screw clamp according to claim 1, 
wherein
 a retracting spring (62) is 
provided inside the transverse beam (53, 73), which in its no-load position 

makes sure that the beam (55) is kept in its retracted position inside the 
support pipe (54). 
Screw clamp according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the inner beam (55) of the 
transverse beam (53, 73) is provided with an oblong opening (60), which is 

engaged by a pin (61) that is attached to the support pipe (54) and thus limits 
the transverse movement of the inner beam (55).  

 
Screw clamp according to claim 3, 
wherein
 a compression spring (62) is 
located inside the oblong opening (60) and acts as a retracting spring. 
Screw clamp according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 a clamping unit 
(71) is provided on the transverse beam (73) to secure the transverse beam 

that can be moved along the longitudinal beam (72) in position on the 
longitudinal beam (72).
