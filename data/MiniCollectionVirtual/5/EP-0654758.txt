<ABSTRACT>
A dot pattern is generated by using scalable font
data on the basis of received print data, and then

printed. One scalable font set corresponds to two kinds
of dot pattern generating modes. One generates a dot

pattern with quality being given precedence, and the
other generates a dot pattern with speed being given

precedence and for printing at high speed, though
quality inferior. The two modes are switchable to

perform printing to fit user's needs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
control apparatus and control method thereof and, more
particularly, to a recording control apparatus which
records an image based on inputted print data on a
recording medium, such as a recording paper sheet, and a
control method thereof.A conventional apparatus of this kind, especially
an image processing unit of a laser beam printer, such
as a page printer, is constructed so that font data and
font scaler, which generate font pattern of desired size
on the basis of font data, corresponds to each other on
a one-to-one relationship.In general, the font scaler operates a very
complicated process so that image quality is given
priority. Therefore, when a page containing many
characters is printed, the process requires considerable
time, and the user has to wait for a considerably long
time until the printing job is completed, although the
quality of the printing is high. The EP-A-0 386 995 discloses an output apparatus for
outputting an image pattern by dots on the basis of a vector
font. The apparatus comprises a memory to store coordinate
point data indicative of an outline of a pattern, a first
mode to arrange into dots on the basis of the coordinate
point data stored in the memory, a second mode to reduce the
number of outline points than that in the first mode and to
arrange into dots, a mode indicating device to indicate the
first or second mode and an output device to output dots in
accordance with the first or second mode on the basis of the
indication from the mode indicating device. By properly
selecting the first or second mode, an image pattern can be
displayed or printed by dots at a desired quality and a
desired speed on the basis of the vector font.Thus, the EP-A-0 386 995 discloses a generation of pixel
image data in first and second modes, the first mode being
provided for arranging character codes into dots on the basis
of the coordinate point data, and the second mode being
provided to reduce the number of outline points from that of
the first mode.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
recording control apparatus and method capable of operating
process which is suitable to operator environment and needs,
by switching processing speed and output quality being given
precedence.This object is achieved by a recording control apparatus
according to claim 1.Moreover, this object is achieved by a recording control
method according to claim 8 as well as a recording control
program according to claim 15. Other features and advantages
