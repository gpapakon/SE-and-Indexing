<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a positive polyimide pattern which comprises forming a coating of a actinic-ray-sensitive 
polyimide precursor composition on a substrate, exposing the coating to actinic rays selectively, treating the resultant 

coating so that the unexposed area will be more highly hardened than the exposed area, and removing the coating of 
the exposed area. The invention process has brought about such an unexpected effect that a positive polyimide pattern 

can be formed by using the conventional actinic-ray-sensitive polyimide precursor composition that has been primarily 
used for forming a negative polyimide pattern. This process can provide readily a positive polyimide pattern having 

excellent performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming polyimide patterns by 
means of a composition of actinic radiation-sensitive polyimide precursors, and 
particularly to a method of forming positive polyimide patterns by means of the 
composition of the actinic radiation-sensitive polyimide precursors. The following methods have been known as methods of forming polyimide 
patterns which use a composition of actinic radiation-sensitive polyimide 
precursors. 
(A) A polyimide pattern forming process which uses a composition wherein carbon-carbon 
double bond which can be dimerized or polymerized by means of actinic 
radiation and amino group or a quaternary salt thereof are added to polyamic 
acid (disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Specification No.4243743). (B) A polyimide pattern forming process which uses a composition of polyamic 
acid with acrylamide added thereto (disclosed in, for example, EP Laid-open No. 
430220). (C) A polyimide pattern forming process which uses a composition of actinic 
radiation-sensitive polyimide precursors wherein a photosensitive group is 
introduced to polyamic acid with ester group. However, all of these processes are of negative type wherein the film in 
portions exposed to he radiation remains, because the irradiated pattern is  
 
developed in such a state that the film in the exposed portion has photo-cured 
to a greater degree than that of the unexposed portion. In negative type 
processes, dust on the mask used in exposure leads to a defect produced therein 
resulting in pin holes formed in the polyimide film. For this reason, there have 
been problems such as low yield of production and low reliability particularly 
in case the polyimide coating is used as a protective layer for semiconductor 
elements or as an inter-layer insulation layer for multi-layer wiring in high-density 
packaging. Thus it has been called for to develop a method of forming 
positive polyimide patterns by means of a composition of actinic radiation-sensitive 
polyimide precursors. The following processes have been known as methods of forming positive 
polyimide patterns by means of an actinic radiation-sensitive composition of 
polyimide precursors. 
(D) Polyimide pattern forming processes which uses a composition of actinic 
radiation-sensitive polyimide precursors obtained by introducing a photo-degradable 
photosensitivity to polyamic acid with ester group (disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-61747). (E) Positive polyimide pattern forming processes
