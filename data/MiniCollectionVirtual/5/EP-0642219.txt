<ABSTRACT>
This invention has as its object to prevent the 
lower limit value of the linear input range of an 

amplifier from being changed even when the threshold 
voltage of a transistor varies. In order to achieve 

this object, a power supply voltage to be applied to 
the source electrode of a field effect transistor 17 

which receives an input of the amplifier is supplied by 
an output from a source follower 21, 22 constituted by 

a field effect transistor. A power supply voltage to 
be applied to the emitter electrode of a bipolar 

transistor which receives an input of the amplifier is 
supplied by an output from an emitter follower 

constituted by a bipolar transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amplifier and,
more particularly, to an amplifier constituted by
transistors. The present invention is suitably used as
a pre-amplifier for amplifying, e.g., a sensor signal
and the like.Fig. 3 shows an equivalent circuit diagram of a
two-dimensional sensor using a conventional
pre-amplifier. Referring to Fig. 3, the sensor
comprises photoelectric conversion cells each
constituted by a bipolar transistor 1 constituting a
sensor for accumulating carriers generated upon
incidence of light energy at its base, a capacitor 2
for controlling the base potential of the bipolar
transistor 1, and a p-MOS transistor 3 for resetting
the base potential of the bipolar transistor 1. The
sensor further comprises drive lines 4 for driving each
cell, vertical output lines 5 connected to the emitters
of the bipolar transistors 1, buffer MOS transistors 6
each of which is selected by a vertical shift register
and supplies pulses to the drive line 4 to be driven, a
pulse input terminal 7 for applying drive pulses,
capacitors 8 for accumulating output signal voltages 
from the cells, MOS transistors 9 each for switching
between the vertical output line 5 and the capacitor 8,
a horizontal output line 10, MOS transistors 11 each of
which is selected by an output from a horizontal shift
register, and transfers a signal voltage from the
corresponding capacitor 8 onto the horizontal output
line 10, a MOS transistor 12 for resetting the
horizontal output line 10, MOS transistors 13 for
resetting the sensor cells, the vertical output lines
5, and the capacitors 8, a power supply terminal 14 for
applying a reset voltage as a reference voltage of this
sensor system, a terminal 15 for applying pulses to the
gates of the MOS transistors 9, a terminal 16 for
applying pulses to the gates of the MOS transistors 13,
an amplifier MOS transistor 17 whose gate is connected
to the horizontal output line 10, a load MOS transistor
18 whose well and source are connected to the drain of
the amplifier MOS transistor 17, and whose gate and
drain are connected to the power supply voltage, a
terminal 19 for applying pulses to the gate of the MOS
transistor 12, and an output terminal 20 of a
pre-amplifier defined by the amplifier MOS transistor
17 and the load MOS transistor 18.Fig. 3 exemplifies the sensor having 2 Ã— 2 cells
for the sake of simplicity. The operation of this
conventional two-dimensional sensor is described in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-186466. The characteristics of the
