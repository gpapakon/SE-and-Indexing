<ABSTRACT>
A container for receiving and separating blood plasma into its ingredients comprises two sealingly coupled sections (1 and 2). One container section (2) and the adjacent portion of the other container section are made of solid material, and the two container sections are screwed together. The container sections (1 and 2) comprise their respective chambers (29 and 30) for receiving their respective fluid ingredients, and these chambers are interconnected through a connecting channel (31) through the abutting portions, at which the container sections (1 and 2) are screwed together. A valve seat (21, 27) is shaped at each end of the connecting channel (31) for each valve member (22, 16) for a sealing closing of the chambers (29, 30) in the separated state of the container sections (1, 2). The valve members (22, 16) comprise mutually abutting projections (23, 12) ensuring a distance between the valve members (22, 16) exceeding the distance between the associated valve seats (27, 21) in the coupled state of the container sections (1, 2), but being smaller than the distance between the associated valve seats (27, 21) in a position during a separating movement of the container sections (1, 2). Furthermore, retaining means (15, 16) are provided for ensuring that the valve members (22, 19) do not engage the valve seats (27, 21) in the coupled state of the container sections (1, 2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a container for receiving and 
separating a fluid, preferably blood plasma, into its 
ingredients, where said container comprises two sealingly 
coupled sections. It is known inter alia from US-A.-4,714,457 to utilize 
the plasma fraction in blood for the preparation of 
so-called tissue glue. According to the publication the 
coagulation factors, such as fibrinogen, fibronectine, 
factor VIII, and factor XIII are precipitated from the 
plasma fraction. These coagulation factors are precipitated 
for instance by cryoprecipitation or by means of a 
precipitation-promoting agent such as ethanol. The precipitated 
precipitate includes mainly fibrinogen and is 
used as tissue glue, such as in connection with operation 
wounds, by the addition of a suitable enzyme, such 
as thrombine. Like in nature, the fibrinogen and thrombine 
form together fibrin, which is an insoluble network 
of fibre-like material constituting a kind of tissue 
glue interconnecting the wound surfaces during a healing 
process. On account of the latter effect, a concentrate 
of coagulation factors containing mainly fibrinogen 
turned out to possess a favourable effect on the healing 
process after an operation. For short, the concentrate 
of coagulation factors is below referred to as fibrinogen, 
as said fibrinogen is the main ingredient thereof. Several methods are today used for separating plasma 
from blood. The separating process can be performed by 
means of filters or centrifuging techniques or by way of 
combinations thereof. The methods are usually known as  
 
"plasmapheresis". The methods have been developed because 
it is often sufficient to give the patients a 
plasma transfusion, whereby it is unnecessary also to 
remove slowly regenerating blood cells from the donor. The precipitation of fibrinogen from plasma has previously 
been performed in closed bag systems. The precipitation 
into such bags (blood bags) necessitated production 
of particular means for securing the bags in a 
for centrifugal bowl, in which the centrifuging is to be 
performed. In addition, it is difficult to separate the 
fibrinogen from the plasma in a reliable manner. The 
flexibility of the blood bags often results in the 
viscous fibrinogen loosening from the bag and mixing 
with a remaining plasma in the bag, whereby the concentration 
is substantially reduced. The latter problems 
have had the effect that these methods are not used by 
way of routine today. The container according to the present invention is 
characteri
