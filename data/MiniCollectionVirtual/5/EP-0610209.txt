<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus whereby a communication unit (10) transmits a communication channel request and the nearest base site (12) makes the communication channel grant or allocation. A base site receives the channel request signal, measures the received signal strength (RSSI) level of the received signal, and if that level is above a threshold level, a communication  channel is allocated to the requesting communication unit, thus establishing a communication link. If the channel request signal does not have an RSSI level above the threshold, the base site delays the grant of a communication channel for a period inversely proportional to the measured RSSI level to allow other base sites the opportunity to grant a communication channel to the requesting communication unit. If the base site determines that another base site has granted a communication channel to the requesting communication unit, the allocation process is stopped, and the base site continues scanning for channel request signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHANNEL ACQUISITION METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A COMMUNICATION SYSTEMTechnical Field This invention relates generally to communication systems and more specifically to radio telephone communication systems .BackgroundRadio telephone communication systems (such as second generation cordless telephone, or Digital European Cordless Telephone) comprise a plurality of base sites (also known as telepoints) and a plurality of radio telephones (also known as handsets). Taking second generation cordless telephone (CT2) as an example, the users of the CT2 radio telephones communicate with users of other radio telephones or subscribers in a public switched telephone network (PSTN) via the base points. A large number of base points is desirable in certain areas (such as shopping malls) where many persons are likely to place radio telephone calls because that eliminates gaps in coverage by the base site network. However, these base sites are not synchronized with each other. When a radio telephone user wishes to place a call, he or she causes the radio telephone unit to transmit a channel request signal. Since each base site is monitoring the channels of the CT2 system independently, the base site that grants the channel request is not necessarily the one closest to the radio telephone unit transmitting the channel 

 request signal. That may be a problem because the user may move out of range of the base site, thus causing the communication link to be dropped. On the other hand, if the nearest base station had made the channel grant, the radio telephone user would have been able to continue the communication while moving in a greater area. Accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus for acquiring a communication channel that overcomes the above problem.Summary of the InventionBriefly, according to the invention, a method and apparatus are provided whereby a communication unit transmits a communication channel request and the nearest base site makes the communication channel grant. A base site receives the channel request signal, measures the received signal strength (RSS) level of the received signal, and if that level is above a first threshold level, a communication channel is granted to the requesting unit, thus establishing a communication link. Then, the base site maintains the communication link as long as RSSI level does not drop below a second threshold level that is substantially lower than the first threshold level.Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of a

Claims
1. In a communication system having a plurality of base sites capable of allocating a communication channel for use by a communication unit in response to a request from the communication unit, and any of the base sites receiving the request being capable of allocating the communication channel without regard to the availability of a base site closer to the requesting communication unit, a method facilitating the use of a particular base site comprising the step of: allocating a communication channel to the communication unit requesting the communication channel after determining that other base sites have not allocated the communication channel to the communication unit requesting the communication channel. 

2. In a communication system having a plurality of base sites capable of allocating a communication channel for use by a communication unit in response to a request from the communication unit, and any of the base sites receiving the request being capable of allocating the communication channel without regard to the availability of a base site closer to the requesting communication unit, a method facilitating the use of a particular base site comprising the steps of:
(a) determining whether a communication channel is available for allocation to a communication unit requesting the communication channel; and
(b) allocating the communication channel to the communication unit requesting the communication channel after determining that other base sites have not allocated the communication channel to the communication unit requesting the communication channel when it is determined that the communication channel is available.
