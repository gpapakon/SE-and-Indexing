<ABSTRACT>
A gas-fired fan burner (3) for a central heating 
installation, comprising a cylindrical burner housing (4), a 

venturi (12) arranged concentrically within the housing, a burner 
fan (5) for the forced supply of combustion air, an injection nozzle (17) 

and a fuel supply line (19), the venturi connecting to a burner head and an 
annular space (15) 

between the burner housing wall and the venturi being in 
open communication with the furnace (6) and with the inlet of the 

venturi (16), the burner head (13) being designed as one or more 
concentric, hollow gas-conducting rings round which axially 

supplied air flows, each ring having gas outlet openings 
perpendicular to the burner axis and distributed in 

circumferential direction, there being provided flange-shaped 
gas/air mixture-promoting vortex elements upstream from the 

gas outlet openings, at least one hollow gas-conducting ring 
having downstream-directed tubes which also comprise gas 

outlet openings in a plane perpendicular to the burner axis, 
which openings are adjusted such that at the first series 25% 

and at the second series 75% of the gas flows out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a burner, in particular a gas-fired 
fan burner for a central heating installation. Such a burner, comprising a substantially cylindrical 
burner housing, of which one end, being the outlet end, is 
connectable to an opening in a furnace wall of a central 
heating boiler, while to the other end thereof, being the 
inlet end of the burner housing, a burner fan for forced 
supply of combustion air and a fuel supply line are 
connectable, a mixing tube extending concentrically within the 
burner housing and connecting to a burner head at the outlet 
end of the burner housing, which burner head, in mounted 
condition of the burner, extends into the furnace by a flame 
cup surrounding the burner head, while an annular space 
between the burner housing wall and the mixing tube is in open 
communication with the furnace at the outlet end and with the 
inner space of the mixing tube at the inlet end of the burner 
housing, is described as a burner for liquid fuel in U.S. 
patent specification 3,741,166. When the known burner is in operation, combustion air is 
blown by the fan in a forced manner through the mixing tube to 
the burner head, while fuel is supplied to the burner head. 
The combustible mixture is combusted at the burner head, the 
flame being stabilized within the flame cup. Due to the 
pressure prevailing in the furnace and also due to the 
underpressure created in the mixing tube by the air flowing 
through, a portion of the combustion or flue gases is returned 
from the furnace via the annular channel  
 
and mixed with the combustion air in the mixing tube. When mixed with the combustion air, the flue gas thus 
recirculated reduces the partial oxygen pressure, thereby 
increasing the heat capacity of the flue gas and reducing the 
flame temperature. Thus, a reduction of the NOx emission is 
achieved. In the known burner, where both the burner housing and 
the mixing tube are cylindrical while the resistance of the 
furnace remains substantially the same, the flue gas 
recirculation does not decrease in proportion to the air flow 
rate when the burner is modulated, for instance adjusted from 
full load to partial load. An excess of recirculated flue gas 
(more than 20-30%) has an adverse effect on the combustion 
process and may cause an unstable flame. If the known burner housing construction were used in gas 
burners of the type as described in NL patent No. 153322, 
where the burner head is designed as one or more concentric, 
hollow gas-conducting rings round which
