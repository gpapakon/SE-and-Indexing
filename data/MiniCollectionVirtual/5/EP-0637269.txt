<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to screens and to screen mounting
and tensioning arrangements in screening apparatus for
use, for example, in the separation of solids from a
slurry.Hereafter in this specification, including the appended
claims, the following expressions have the meanings
ascribed, thus "screening apparatus" is a general reference
to an entire or complete machine; "screen assembly"
refers to a sub-assembly of a screening apparatus
and envisages a screen unit together with a supporting
and/or carrying structure therefor which may be withdrawable
from the screening apparatus; and "screen unit"
is a mesh material fixed directly to frame or supporting
members.Vibratory screening apparatus is used in the treatment
of oil well drilling minds in order to remove and
discharge cuttings and to reclaim the liquid. Presently
proposed such apparatus has an upper relatively coarse
mesh screen assembly and a lower relatively fine mesh
screen assembly. Both of these screen assemblies are
vibrated and both may be mounted in a common carrying
structure or "basket" with a common vibrating means. In
the context of drilling mud reclamation, the present
invention is concerned particularly with a fine mesh
screen assembly and a screen unit therefor.In US Patent Specification No. 1879377 (McNeely),
principal considerations for the construction and
operation of a fine mesh screen unit are described, and
teach that the fine mesh material be sufficiently and
evenly tensioned and provided with support or backing
which support or backing should be distributed
throughout the area of the mesh material and should also 
be unitary with the mesh material. Thus, McNeely
describes a screen unit comprising a pretensioned fine
mesh material brought into contact with and fixed to a
pretensioned coarse mesh or grid. Similar concepts are
taught in UK Patent Specification No. 2161715 (Bailey).
In both McNeely and Bailey, the pretension in the fine
mesh material is maintained by the backing or support.
Disadvantages of this arrangement are that a fine mesh
material being somewhat fragile is vulnerable to
accidental damage whilst under tension; moreover, the
quality of tensioning in respect of degree and/or
evenness can deteriorate during storage due to "creep"
in the mesh material; and also, once the screen unit has
been manufactured, on-site or user-adjustment of the
tension in the mesh material is not feasible.In US Patent Specification No. 4457839 (Bailey) a lower
or bottom screen assembly within the main structure of a
vibratory

<CLAIMS>
A screen assembly comprising a screen unit (19)
releasably mounted on a relatively rigid support means

(20), the screen unit (19) having a sheet (21) of mesh
material engaged with a grid means (22) maintaining

tautness of the sheet (21) of mesh material, the grid means
(22) defining a latticed surface all of which is bonded to

the sheet of mesh material; 
characterised in that
 the grid
means (22) is yieldable at least in the plane of said

latticed surface to permit relaxation of the sheet (21) of
mesh material upon release of the screen unit (19) from the

support means (20).
A screen assembly according to claim 1; 
characterised
in that
 there is a sliding contact between the support
means (20) and the gird means (22).
A screen assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2;

characterised in that
 the grid means (22) is made of a
mate
rial having a resilient or elastic property.
A screen assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2;

characterised in that
 the grid means (22) is made of a hard
rubber.
A screen assembly according to any one of the
preceding claims; 
characterised in that
 the grid means (22)
and the sheet (21) of mesh material together define a

rectangular configuration in plan view, that along the
sides of said configuration the grid means (22) engages

substantially rigid side members (23) defining a first
frame, and that these side members (23) are mutually

relatively shiftable in said directions.
A screen assembly according to claim 5; 

characterised in that
 the sheet (21) of mesh material is
fixed to each of the side members (23).
A screen assembly according to claim 5 or claim 6;

characterised in that
 the support means (20) comprises a
second frame (28) of rectangular configuration similar to

that of the said first frame, that said side members (23)
are arranged around said second frame (28), that the

second frame (28) incorporates shiftable tensioning
elements (30) engaging said side members (23), and that

these tensioning elements (30) are associated with first
actuating means (31) operable to shift these tensioning

elements (30) to vary tension in the screen unit.
A screen assembly according to claim 7;

characterised in that
 the said second frame (28)
incorporates shiftable clamp elements (34A, 34B)

associated with second actuating means (35) operable to
shift the clamp elements (34A, 34B) for engaging and

disengaging a carrying structure (11) of a screening
apparatus.
A screen assembly according to claim 8;

characterised in that
 the first (31) and second (35)
actuating means are mutually independently operable

pneumatic actuating means.
A screen assembly according to any one of the
preceding claims; 
characterised in that
 a contact
interface between the support means (20) and the grid

means (22) defines a configuration which is convex
towards the sheet (21) of mesh material.
Vibratory screening apparatus 
characterised by

incorporating a screen assembly according to any one of
the preceding claims. 
Vibratory screening apparatus 
characterised by

incorporating two screening assemblies (17A, 17B) each
according to any one of claims 1 to 10, and in that these

assemblies are mutually hinged end-to-end with respect to
the fore-and-aft direction (A) of the apparatus.
Screen unit (19) for a screen assembly according to
any one of claims 1 to 10, comprising a sheet (21) of mesh

material fixed to a grid means (22), the latter defining a
latticed surface all of which is bonded to the sheet (21)

of mesh material; 
characterised in that
 the grid means (22)
is yieldable at least in the plane of said latticed surface

to permit the sheet (21) of mesh material to relax.
A screen unit according to claim 13; 
characterised by

including substantially rigid side members (23) which are
disposed to define a frame and which are mutually

relatively shiftable in said directions, and in that the
grid means (22) engages these side members (23).
A screen unit according to claim 14; 
characterised in
that
 the sheet (21) of mesh material is fixed to each of
said side members (23).
