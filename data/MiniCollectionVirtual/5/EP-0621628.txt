<ABSTRACT>
A compact high current broad beam ion 
implanter (100) capable of serial processing 

employs a high current density source (2), an 
analyzing magnet (3) to direct a desired species 

through a resolving slit (4), and a second magnet 
(5) to deflect the resultant beam while rendering 

it parallel and uniform along its width dimension. 
Both magnets (3,5) have relatively large pole 

gaps, wide input and output faces, and deflect 
through a small radius of curvature to produce a 

beam free of instabilities. Multipole elements 
incorporated within at least one magnet (3) allow 

higher order aberrrations to be selectively varied 
to locally adjust beam current density and achieve 

the high degree of uniformity along the beam width 
dimension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ion implanter apparatus, a method of providing a magnet assembly in a beam line and a method of implanting a workpiece with an ion beam,
and more specifically to the
design of high current implanters for serial
production line implantation of ions into large
workpieces such as semiconductor wafers.The doping of semiconductors with
electrically active elements is now performed almost
exclusively with ion implanters. Several recent
trends in semiconductor technologies suggest
characteristics that would be desirable in the design
of ion implanters. These trends include the
following:
For workpieces which are silicon
wafers, the standard wafer size has increased over
the years until 200mm is the standard diameter used
in new facilities today, and manufacturers are
planning for 300mm and larger.For workpieces which are flat panel
displays, dimensions today exceed 300mm, and larger
sizes are to be expected. As the density of memory elements in
DRAMs increases, the implanted energy requirements at
high doses are decreasing. High doses of boron at
energies between 2 and 10 keV will be required of
future process tools.Processes require the ability to
control the angle of incidence of the ion beam on the
semiconductor substrates. Variation across the wafer
can cause process failures.High current ion implanters may be broadly
defined as the class of instruments in which the ion
beam current is great enough that it must be
space-charge neutralized to be transported through
the ion implanter. This property generally holds
true for currents in excess of 1 mA. To meet the
usual range of practical applications, high current
implanters are typically specified to deliver up to
between 15 and 30 mA of n-type dopant ions, and up to
between 6 and 12 mA of boron ions. All high current
implanters commercially available in 1991 implant
batches of wafers, and achieve uniformity of doping
by scanning, placing the wafers on a spinning disk,
wheel, or drum, to provide one scanning direction,
and either moving the wafer carrier normal to the
beam, or electromagnetically scanning the beam to
achieve another scanning direction.Batch processing systems of this type suffer
from reduced throughput when the batch size is
mismatched to the size of the production lot, making
it very expensive to test a process, since a complete 
batch must be processed every time. Rotating disk
assemblies must be cone-shaped if centrifugal force
is used to retain the wafers, causing variations in
implant angle and such
