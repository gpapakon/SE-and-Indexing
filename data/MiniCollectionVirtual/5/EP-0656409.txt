<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to coating 
compositions which can firmly adhere to 
inorganic substrates, especially stainless steel 
strips, and form a coating having good 
resistance to weather, water, stains and 
alkalis. The coating composition is useful as a 
building exterior paint vehicle and a coating 
agent which can be applied to metals without 
primers. Several weather resistant coating 
compositions are known as a substitute for 
acrylic lacquer. One composition is based on 
vinyl polymers containing a hydrolyzable silyl 
group as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (JP-A) Nos. 129405/1980 and 
3610/1982. These polymers are sensitive to 
moisture in air and crosslink at room temperature 
to form films which are improved in  
 
solvent and water resistance over the acrylic 
lacquer. However, these coating compositions 
are not satisfactory in weather resistance in 
that they do not cure in a low humidity 
environment, for example, in winter. In such a 
situation, curing cannot be promoted even by 
heating. Also it now becomes a serious problem that 
coatings of acrylic lacquer are stained with 
acid rain. An improvement is thus made in 
acrylic-melamine paint. JP-A 108049/1988, for 
example, discloses to add a metal chelate to a 
vinyl polymer obtained by copolymerizing a 
(meth)acrylate containing an alkoxysilyl-terminated 
diorganopolysiloxane and a (meth)acrylate 
containing an oxirane. Coatings of 
this composition are improved in acid 
resistance, but insufficient in weather 
resistance. Also JP-A 221123/1988 discloses a 
composition wherein a metal chelate is added to 
an acrylic copolymer containing an epoxy group, 
a hydrolyzable silyl group and a siloxane moiety 
for improving low-temperature curing property. 
This composition, however, is low in adhesion 
between its coating and the underlying substrate  
 
of stainless steel or the like. The composition 
is applicable only to a limited type of 
material. For the purpose of improving the weather 
resistance of coatings, JP-A 252414/1991 
proposes a composition comprising a vinyl 
polymer containing a hydrolyzable silyl group, a 
silanol-terminated organopolysiloxane, and a 
dealcoholysis catalyst. Undesirably coatings of 
this composition are also low in adhesion to 
stainless steel or the like. With respect to resin compositions for 
exterior paint having the best weather 
resistance, there are widely used fluoro-resin 
compositions wherein a copolymer of a fluoro-olefin 
and a hydroxyl-containing vinyl ether is 
cured with
