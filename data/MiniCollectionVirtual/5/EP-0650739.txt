<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method enabling the injection of fluid 
media into a plurality of patients in which there is provided a 

fluid supply source providing multiple doses, metering means for 
measuring the doses, pressurizing means to effect injection, 

contamination preventing means between fluid source and patient 
and, when desired, electronic control means to integrate 

operation of the apparatus and process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for injection of a fluid medium into
a plurality of patients during medical procedures, comprising a supply source of a
pre-selected fluid medium, metering means operably connected to said supply
source for removing measured quantities of the fluid medium therefrom, fluid
medium receiving means operably connected to said metering means to receive the
measured quantities from the metering means, pressurizing means in operative
association with said fluid medium receiving means to pressurize the fluid medium
for a patient infusion, contamination prevention means comprising a valve and a
sterile filter and located between said fluid medium supply source and a patient
precluding back flow of material from the patient to said supply source to prevent
contamination of said supply source or any fluid path member not disposed of after
use with a patient, electronic control means operably connected to said metering
means providing for passage of measured quantities of a fluid medium through said
metering means and fluid path means for conducting pressurized fluid medium from
said pressurizing means to the patient. Contrast media are used in many medical diagnostic and therapeutic imaging
procedures. Diagnostically these include X-ray procedures for instance,
angiography, venography and urography, CT scanning, magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI], and ultrasonic imaging. Contrast media is used during therapeutic
procedures such as angioplastic and other interventional radiologic procedures.
Because this contrast material is injected into the patient, it must be sterile and
contain a minimum of pyrogens.Presently, most contrast is provided in sterilized glass bottles, ranging in size from
20 ml to 200 ml. Plastic packages are also available. Non-ionic X-ray contrast
media is expensive, on the order of $ 1/ml. Ionic contrast media costs about $
0.10/ml. Non-ion contrast has fewer complications but because of the cost, it is not
universally used. MRI contrast costs about $ 5/ml. All the containers are single use,
which means that once a bottle is opened, it should be used for that patient or
thrown away, although a multi-use 1,000 ml bottle has been recently approved by
the FDA.A hospital must purchase and stock many concentrations in multiple bottle sizes to
provide the right amount of the right concentration for a specific procedure, while
minimizing the wastage of contrast remaining in any opened bottles. This multitude of sizes and concentrations increases
costs

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for injection of a fluid medium into a plurality of patients during
medical procedures, comprising:


(a) a supply source (10) of a pre-selected fluid medium;
(b) metering means (12) operably connected to said supply source (10) for
removing measured quantities of the fluid medium therefrom;
(c) fluid medium receiving means operably connected to said metering means
(12) to receive the measured quantities from the metering means (12);
(d) pressurizing means (25) in operative association with said fluid medium
receiving means to pressurize the fluid medium for patient infusion;
(e) contamination prevention means comprising a valve (21) and a sterile filter
(26) and located between said fluid medium supply source (10) and a patient

precluding back flow of material from the patient to said supply source (10) to
prevent contamination of said supply source (10) or any fluid path member not

disposed of after use with a patient;
(f) electronic control means (35) operably connected to said metering means (12)
providing for passage of measured quantities of fluid medium through said

metering means (12); 
(g) fluid path means for conducting pressurized fluid medium from said
pressurizing means (25) to the patient;
characterized in that

   the valve (21) is a unidirectional flow valve and that the sterile filter (26) is
located in a disposable portion (27) of the fluid path means, the disposable

portion (27) carrying the fluid medium to the patient and being disposable for
each of a plurality of patients including the sterile filter (26).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said apparatus
further includes:


(a) a supply source (11) of a diluent for use to alter the concentration of said fluid
medium;
(b) metering means (13) operably connected to said diluent source (11) for
removing measured quantities of diluent therefrom; and
(c) said fluid medium receiving means being means (20) for combining the
quantities of fluid medium and diluent that are removed from the respective

sources (10, 11).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said pressurizing
means (25) is a gear pump.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 or in claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 said
supply source (10) or the supply sources (10, 11) are bulk containers including means for indicating

volume and concentration of the fluid medium contained therein.
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 or in any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that
 said
supply source (10) or the supply sources (10, 11) comprise means for supplying a plurality of fluid

media. 
An apparatus as defined in any one of claims 1-5, 
characterized in that
 the
electronic control mean
s (35) is programmed with patient information,
procedure information and fluid medium information to select the desired

concentration and volume of fluid medium required for the individual patient.
