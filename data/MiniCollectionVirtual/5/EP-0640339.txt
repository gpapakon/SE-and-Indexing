<ABSTRACT>
Wortmannin and certain of its analogs are 
inhibitors of bone loss/bone resorption and cartilage 

degradation. Use of the following compounds 

wherein R is hydrogen or acetoxy, and R' is C₁-C₆ alkyl; 

wherein R'' is hydrogen, C₁-C₆ alkyl or 

wherein 
R''' is hydrogen or C₁-C₆ alkyl; 


wherein R¹ is hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl; and R² is 
hydrogen or methyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt 

of any of the above.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new method for treating 
vertebrates suffering from diseases associated with 
increased bone or cartilage resorption, involving the 
therapeutic use of wortmannin and analogs thereof. The current major diseases or conditions of bone which 
are of public concern include post-menopausal osteoporosis, 
hysterectomy patients, senile osteoporosis, patients 
undergoing long-term treatment of corticosteroids, side 
effects from glucocorticoid or steroid treatment, patients 
suffering from Cushings's syndrome, gonadal dysgensis, 
periarticular erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, Paget's disease, osteohalisteresis, 
osteomalacia, hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteopenia due 
to bone metastases, periodontal disease, and 
hyperparathyroidism.  All of these conditions are characterized by bone 
loss, resulting from an imbalance between the degradation 
of bone (bone resorption) and the formation of new healthy 
bone. This turnover of bone continues normally throughout 
life and is the mechanism by which bone regenerates. 
However, the conditions stated above will tip the balance 
towards bone loss such that the amount of bone resorbed is 
inadequately replaced with new bone, resulting in net bone 
loss. One of the most common bone disorders is post-menopausal 
osteoporosis which affects an estimated 20 to 25 
million women in the United States alone. Women after 
menopause experience an increase in the rate of bone 
turnover with resulting net loss of bone, as circulating 
estrogen levels decrease. The rate of bone turnover 
differs between bones and is highest in sites enriched with 
trabecular bone, such as the vertebrae and the femoral 
head. The potential for bone loss at these sites 
immediately following menopause is 4-5% per year. The 
resulting decrease in bone mass and enlargement of bone 
spaces leads to increased fracture risk, as the mechanical 
integrity of bone deteriorates rapidly. At present, there are 20 million people with 
detectable vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis and 
250,000 hip fractures per year attributable to osteoporosis 
in the U.S. The latter case is associated with a 12% 
mortality rate within the first two years and 30% of the 
patients will require nursing home care after the fracture. 
Therefore, bone disorders are characterized by a noticeable 
mortality rate, a considerable decrease in the survivor's 
quality of life, and a significant financial burden to 
families. Essentially all of the conditions listed above would 
benefit from
