<ABSTRACT>
For fitting luminaire inserts with electrical or mechanical components (3), spring brackets (4), which engage in a latching manner into the profile of a supporting sheet metal (2) of the luminaire insert, are standardly used as fastening elements. The trough-shaped supporting sheet-metal profile has on both sides of the edge a shoulder (22), which runs inwardly at the sides, as bearing surface on the supporting rail (1) of the luminous rail arrangement and at the upper edge a side edge (23) which is bent off inwardly at an acute angle. The spring brackets (4) have latching tabs (41) which are cut off their side walls and are bent off and which in the assembled state engage behind the side edges (23) of the supporting sheet-metal (2).

<CLAIMS>
Light-strip arrangement having a carrying rail
(1) which is of U-shaped design and is intended for

luminaire inserts to be secured thereon, said inserts
having a metal carrying plate (2) of a tray-like profile,

formed from a planar base surface (21) and flanged side
walls, which can be fastened releasably on the carrying

rail (1) and, for its part, already has luminaire components
(3) such as lamp sockets, and electric components

prefitted on it and wired up, characterized in that, at
a predetermined distance from the base surface (21), the

side walls of the metal carrying plate (2) of the
luminaire insert have a drawn-in shoulder (22), which

serves as an abutment surface for in each case one leg
end (11) of the carrying rail (1), and a border which

projects beyond the shoulder and is in the form of a side
edge (23) which is bent so as to project obliquely

inwards, and in that provided in each case as fastening
element for the components (3) which are to be arranged

within this profile cross-section of the metal carrying
plate (2) is a spring clip (4) which is designed so as to

enclose the respective component (3) elastically on all
sides in a tong-like manner and whose side surfaces have

in each case at least one latching nose (41) which, in
the fitted state of the spring clip, engage behind the

side edges (23) of the metal carrying plate (2) in a
latching manner.
Light-strip arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the spring clip (4) is produced in

a single piece from a spring sheet steel.
Light-strip arrangement according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the latching noses (41) of the

spring clip (4) are cut out of the side walls of the
latter in the form of lugs and are angled so as to be

oriented outwards.
Light-strip arrangement according to Claim 2 or
3, characterized in that the latching noses (41) are of

triangular design, it being the case that, when the
spring clip (4) is attached, one of the two outwardly

projecting triangle sides forms a run-on edge onto the
metal-carrying-plate profile (e.g. 23) and the other

triangle side forms the actual latching surface on the
inner border of the metal-carrying-plate profile.
Light-strip arrangement according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the shoulder (22)

and side edge (23) of the metal-carrying-plate profile
form in each case a border-side cable duct (24) for

receiving wiring cables (7).
Light-strip arrangement according to Claim 5,
characterized in that there is provided at least one

cable-retaining means (8) for securing the wiring cables
(7), and this retaining means can be clamped, with

elastic deformation, in the border of the metal carrying
plate (2), between the base surface (21) of the latter

and the side edges (23).
Light-strip arrangement according to Claim 6,
characterized in that the cable-retaining means (8) is

designed as an elongate plastic part with side walls (81)
which are arranged in the form of a star in cross-section

and whose free ends, in the fitted state, are supported
on the base surface (21) of the metal carrying plate (2)

and engage behind one of the side edges (23) of the
metal-carrying-plate profile, the braced side walls of

the cable-retaining means which are directed towards the
inner wall of the metal carrying plate (2) securing in

clamping, yet releasable manner the wiring cables (7)
laid in the cable duct (24).
