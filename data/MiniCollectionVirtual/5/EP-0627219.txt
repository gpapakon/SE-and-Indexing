<ABSTRACT>
A drug containing a calmodulin inhibitor as an active 
ingredient is disclosed. This drug is useful in the 

suppression of neuronal cell death, in particular brain 
neuronal cell death, due to, for example, cerebral ischemia. 
Also, a drug containing a compound capable of 
inhibiting binding of calmodulin to a cytoskeltal protein as 

an active ingredient and a drug containing a compound 
suppressing the breakdown of a cytoskeltal protein as an 

active ingredient are disclosed. 
These drugs are useful in the treatment and 
prevention of various diseases in the brain and sequelae 

thereof as well as in the prevention of relapses of these 
diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drug which is useful in 
the treatment and prevention of various diseases in the brain 
and sequelae thereof as well as in the prevention of relapses 
of these diseases. Cerebrovascular disorders (the term "cerebrovascular 
disorders" as used herein means disorders in various brain 
cells and intracerebral blood vessels induced by, for 
example, ischemia) break out due to so-called cerebral 
ischemia, wherein the blood stream in the brain is lowered to 
the threshold or below, which is induced by occlusion of 
blood vessel caused by a constriction of blood vessel, 
cerebral thrombosis or cerebral. embolus. Kirino et al. 
[Brain Res., 377:344 - 347 (1982)] found out that when 
transient cerebral ischemia was loaded to a gerbil, so-called 
delayed neuronal cell death, i.e., slow and delayed 
hippocampal pyramidal neuronal cell death was observed 2 or 3 
days thereafter. Although attempts have been made to clarify 
the degenerative process of neuron after central damage (for 
example, ischemia), this mechanism has not been clarified so 
far. According to Siesjoe and Bengtsson [J. Cereb. Blood 
Flow Metab., 9:127 (1989)], at ischemia, glutamate is  
 
liberated from the presynaptic side to synaptic clefts and 
then binds to a glutamate receptor in the postsynaptic side. 
Thus the calcium ion influx into the cells and the liberation 
of calcium ion from intracellular storage sites are promoted. 
At the same time, the extrusion of intracellular calcium ion 
is suppressed due to decreased calcium-ATPase activity. As a 
result, the intracellular calcium ion concentration is 
elevated, which results in the neuronal cell death. Compared 
with the extracellular calcium ion concentration, the 
intracellular calcium ion concentration is extremely low. It 
is known that cells cannot survive when the intercellular 
calcium ion concentration is elevated to a certain level. 
However the process from an increase in the intracellular 
calcium ion concentration to neuronal cell death has not been 
clarified yet. Also, there have been reported that at cerebral 
ischemia, calmodulin, which is a calcium-binding protein, was 
activated [Picone et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., 
9:805 - 811 (1989)], the activity of calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase was changed [Churn et al., Stroke, 21:1715 - 
1721 (1990)] and breakdown of fodrin, which is a calmodulin-binding 
cytoskeltal protein, was accelerated by cerebral 
ischemia disorders [Seubert et al., Brain Res., 492:366 - 370 
(1989)]. On the other
