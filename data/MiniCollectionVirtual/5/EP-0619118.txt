<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to use of a peptide derivative 
comprising a tripeptide unit or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition 
for inhibiting metastasis of tumor. Fibronectin is a protein involved in the cell-extracellular 
substrate cohesion and is likewise thought to be 
involved in coagulation of blood platelets and the metastasis 
of tumor. These interactions are mediated by a series of 
receptors present in the cell surface region. It is confirmed 
that these receptors can specifically recognize an amino acid 
sequence: arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (hereinafter 
abbreviated as "Arg-Gly-Asp") of the fibronectin although the 
fibronectin is a macromolecule having a molecular weight of 
about 250,000, and there has been reported that the sequence 
plays an important role in the interaction between the receptors 
and the fibronectin (Nature, 309, 1984, p30). The above 
tripeptide sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp, is present in other cohesive 
proteins such as bitronectin, and fibronectin associates with 
receptors of cells via the tripeptide sequence to transfer the 
information of fibronection to the adhered cells. Further,  
 
fibronectin is thought to have bonding ability to natural 
macromolecules such as heparin, collagen and fibrin and to be 
involved in adhesion of cells and interstitial connective tissue 
as well as differentiation and proliferation of cells. Since the proteins having the cell adhesion activity have 
various biological activities as described above, there have 
been conducted many studies on the applications of these 
proteins for pharmaceutical drugs and materials. For example, 
there has been reported a method for inhibiting the coagulation 
of blood platelets by the use of various linear and cyclic 
oligopeptides having an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (Polymer Preprints, 
Japan, 38, 1989, p. 3149; Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (hereinafter referred to as "JP-A-2-174797); 
a method in which a peptide having an Arg-Gly-Asp 
sequence is used as a cell movement-inhibiting agent 
(JP-A-2-4716); and a method using, as a cell-adhesive 
membrane, a PMMA film on which Arg-Gly-Asp sequences are 
immobilized (Polymer Preprints, Japan, 37, 1988, p. 705). In 
addition, JP-A-1-309682 and 1-305960 
disclose a method which comprises covalently bonding peptides 
having Arg-Gly-Asp sequences as essential structural units to a 
polymer and in which the resulting product is used as a 
substrate for cultivating animal cells or for biological 
co
