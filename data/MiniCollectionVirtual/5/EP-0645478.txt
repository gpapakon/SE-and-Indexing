<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed method of shaping a diamond body (10), typically a 
polycrystalline diamond (PCD) wafer or film, involves forming a, typically 

patterned, layer of an "etch-retarding" material (12) on a surface of the diamond 
body, followed by etching with an appropriate etchant (11) (e.g., molten Ce). Etch-retarding 

materials are selected from the materials that have low (typically less than 
5%) mutual solubility with the etchant at the processing temperature, and that 

essentially do not form an intermetallic compound with the etchant at the processing 
temperature. Among etch-retarding materials are Ag, Ca, Mg, Cr, Mo, W, V, Nb, 

Ta, Ti, Zr, Hf, B, P, and alloys thereof, as well as ceramics such as oxides, nitrides, 
carbides and borides, e.g., WO₂, TiO₂, MoC, TiC, Fe₄N, ZrN, MoN, CeB₆ and 

Mo₂B. The etch-retarding material typically will be of appropriately chosen, non-uniform 
thickness, with the thickness at a given point depending on the amount of 

diamond material that is to be removed at that point. The disclosed method has wide 
applicability, e.g., for correcting thickness variations or curvature of PCD films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of shaping diamond bodies, typically
polycrystalline diamond films or wafers.Until recently, no efficient method of removing material from a
polycrystalline diamond film was known. See, for instance, the article by W. van
Enckevort in PhysicsWorld, August 1992, pp. 22-23.Very recently, such methods were discovered. One approach involves
providing for intimate contact at elevated temperature between the diamond film and
a solid metal (e.g., Mn, Fe, Ni, Ti) body or powder. See, for instance, S. Jin et al.,
DiamondandRelatedMaterials, Vol. 2, pp. 1038-1042, S. Jin et al., Applied Physics
Letters, Vol. 60 (16), pp. 1948-1950, and US patent application Serial No.
07/822,470, filed January 17, 1992. Another approach involves contacting, at
elevated temperature, the diamond film with a molten rare earth metal (e.g., Y, La,
Ce). See, for instance, S. Jin et al., Nature, Vol. 362, April 29, 1993, pp. 822-824,
and US patent application Serial No. 07/908,130, filed July 2, 1992 (US-A-5 416 263). US patent
application Serial No. 07/955,634, filed October 2, 1992 (US-A-5 328 550), discloses use of a molten
rare earth/metal alloy to effect the material removal at lower temperature, and US
patent application 08/038,370, filed March 29, 1993 (US-A-5 500 157), discloses a technique for
selective material removal from the surface of polycrystalline diamond film to
produce, e.g., a region of lenticular shape. All the above methods are believed to
involve diffusion of carbon atoms into the hot metal, the "etchant". The above cited
commonly owned US applications are incorporated herein by reference.Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) film is typically produced by chemical
vapor deposition on a substrate. It is frequently observed that the resulting PCD film
("wafer") is not of constant thickness and/or is not flat. Observed variations are
frequently as large as ± 5% over the wafer, with the central region of the wafer
typically having maximum thickness. For many technological applications of PCD
bodies it is typically required that the bodies be of a predetermined thickness and/or
be flat, within relatively narrow limits. For instance, use of thin PCD bodies as heat
spreaders in laser/optical fiber packages requires that the thickness and flatness be
closely controlled. However, provision of flat PCD bodies of predetermined
thickness is at best difficult if the starting product (namely, the PCD film on the
wafer) has curvature and/or has substantial thickness variation. Thus, a method of
