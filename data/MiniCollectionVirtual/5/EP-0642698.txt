<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a fluid-cooled power transistor arrangement, the semiconductor component (1) of which is arranged on an especially boardlike insulating substrate (9) via a metal electrode (7). The flat side of the semiconductor component (1) away from the insulating substrate and/or the side of the insulating substrate away from the semiconductor component is in direct heat-exchange contact with a forced flow of cooling fluid in a channel (13). Here, the insulating substrate (9) or the semiconductor component (1) may form wall regions of the coolant channel (13). In order to improve the heat transfer, the wall regions to be cooled and in contact with the cooling fluid may have a surface microstructure which reduces the boundary layer thickness of the coolant flow. The improvement in the cooling action reduces the structural space required so that the electric valves may be fitted in the immediate vicinity of the electric device to be switched. This is of special advantage in electric motors in order to reduce line inductance. The electric motor and the electric valves are advantageously cooled by the same coolant circuit.
