<ABSTRACT>
A wiring tool (connection tool) for insulated conductors such as cable cores or installation wires for telecommunications with which electrical contact is made without the insulation being stripped, by means of insulation-piercing terminal contacts, is integrally formed from plastic and has a grip part (handle part) at whose one end two plungers are arranged at the end, at a distance from one another, one of the plungers being a guide plunger and the plunger lengths corresponding to the insertion depth of the cable core. The essential feature is that two intrinsically identical but centre-symmetrical guide plungers (10) are provided and in that a contact plunger (13) is provided centrally between the two guide plungers (10) and is significantly longer than the guide plungers (10).

Joining tool for electrically contacting unstripped 
cable cores (20) in insulation displacement contacts with 

a terminal contact (17) which comprises a contact slot 
(27), and an insulating body (16) which comprises a 

clamping slot (21), 

which is moulded in one piece from plastic and 
comprises a handle portion (1) at one end (2) of which on 
the end face are integrally formed two rams (10) with a 

passage for the terminal contact (17), wherein one of the 
rams is a guide ram which pushes the cable core (20) into 

the insulation displacement contact,
 
characterised in that 
two essentially identical guide rams (10) arranged 
centrosymmetrically at a distance from each other are 

provided, and 
centrally between the two guide rams (10) is provided an 
axially symmetrical contact ram (13) which in its length 

projects substantially beyond the length of the guide 
rams (10). 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the contact ram (13) has essentially the form of a 

screwdriver tip. 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the difference in length between guide and contact rams 

(10, 13) is selected in such a way that the tip of the 
contact ram (13) abuts against a depth stop shoulder (29) 

provided on the insulating body (16) when the cable core 
(20) is pushed by the guide rams (10) into the clamping 

slot (21) and into the contact slot (27). 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the guide rams (10) at their upper outer end in each case 

comprise graduations on both sides, so that in each case a  
 

thin guide wall (11) is formed. 
Joining tool according to claim 4, characterised in that 
a transition ramp (12) is provided in a vertical direction 

between the guide wall (11) and the guide ram portion 
arranged vertically above it. 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
wall-like connecting webs (9) are provided in the gaps 

between the two guide rams (10) and the contact ram (13). 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
on. the narrow side (8) on the end face of the tool handle 

(1) is integrally formed a pull-out or disconnect hook 
(31'). 
Joining tool according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the outer end of the pull-out or disconnect hook (31') is 

designed as a screwdriver tip (34). 
Joining tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the handle (1) has a plane gripping plate (3) which at its 

outer circumference comprises a peripheral wall (6) 
projecting symmetrically on both sides, and in that the 

peripheral wall is formed integrally in such a way that 
from the active working side (2) to the upper pressure side 

a preferably at least fivefold widening of the peripheral 
wall is provided, and in that at least one reinforcing 

horizontal intermediate wall (7) is formed integrally.
