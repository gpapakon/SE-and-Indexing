<ABSTRACT>
A computer system having a chief system control program (CHIEF SCP) running in a real machine as a host where the host controls standard system control programs (SCP's)(SCP(1), SCP(n)) and controls virtual machines (Domains) called guests (GUEST (a), GUEST (p)). Guests operate with interpretive execution as second-level guests. Control is transferred from a second-level guest to the guest SCP or to the chief SCP with only one control interception. Control is transferred directly between the second-level guest and Chief SCP bypassing the first-level guest.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPUTER SYSTEM WITH TWO LEVELS OF GUESTSCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the field of computers and particularly to computers having central processing units (CPU's) that operate in accordance with the IBM ESA/390 architecture and particularly to host computers that have interpretive execution of guests.ESA/390 architecture computers are controlled in part by a Program Status Word (PSW) . The program-status word (PSW) includes the instruction address, condition code, and other information used to control instruction sequencing and to determine the state of the computer. The active or controlling PSW is called the current PSW. It governs the program currently being executed.The CPU has an interruption capability, which permits the CPU to switch rapidly to another program in response to exception conditions and external stimuli. When an interruption occurs, the CPU places the current PSW in an assigned storage location, called the old-PSW location, for the particular class of interruption. The CPU fetches a new PSW from a second assigned storage location. This new PSW determines the next program to be executed. When it has finished processing the interruption, the interrupting program may reload the old PSW, making it again the current PSW, so that the interrupted program can continue.The status of the CPU can be changed by loading a new PSW or part of a PSW. Control is switched during an interruption of the CPU by storing the current PSW, so as to preserve the status of the CPU, and then loading a new PSW. 

 A new or modified PSW becomes active (that is, the information introduced into the current PSW assumes control over the CPU) when the interruption or the execution of an instruction that changes the PSW is completed.A storage key is associated with each 4K-byte block of storage that is available in the configuration. The storage key has the following format.ACC F R C 
The bit positions in the storage key are allocated as follows:Access-Control Bits (ACC) :If a reference is subject to key-controlled protection, the four access-control bits, bits 0-3, are matched with the four-bit access key when information is stored, or when information is fetched from a location that is protected against fetching. Fetch-Protection Bit (F) :If a reference is subject to key-controlled protection, the fetched protection bit, bit 4, controls whether key-controlled protection applies to fetch-type references are monitored and that fetching with any

 CLAIMS
1. A computer system having a chief system control program executing in a real machine, said computer system including, one or more first-level system control programs executing under said chief system control program, said chief system control program transferring control between the first-level system control programs and said chief system control program through a control interruption, one or more second-level system control programs executing under said first-level system control programs, said chief system control program transferring control between the second-level system control programs and said chief system control program through one control interruption bypassing said first-level system control programs.
2. A computer system having a chief system control program executing in a real machine and having a plurality of architecturally defined registers including general registers used to store user information and including control registers used for control functions, a common register array comprising, c o m m o n random access memory means having locations for said general registers and for said control registers, said memory including, common write means for writing input information into the memory for said general registers and said control registers, common output means for providing output data read from the memory for said general registers and said control registers, common write address means for providing write addresses for the input data to be written into the memory for 


 general registers and said control registers, common read address means for providing read addresses for reading the output data from the memory for said general registers and said control registers, means for loading a control location in the memory with control information designating control status by the chief system control program, one or more first-level system control programs executing under said chief system control program, said chief system control program transferring control between the first-level system control programs and said chief system control program through a control interruption using the control location in said register array, one or more second-level system control programs executing under said first-level system control programs, said chief system control program transferring control between the second-level system control programs and said chief system control program through one control interruption using the control location in said register array and bypassing said first-level system control programs.
