<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement (1) for the transmission of a pressurized medium from a fixed, outer component (21) into a rotating, inner component (31) which are provided with allocated pressurized-medium passages (26, 27 and 36, 37 resp.), the outer component (21) is fastened to a housing (2) of a machine (M), and the inner component (31) is fastened at a radial distance from the component (21) to a spindle (3). In addition, to compensate for the radial distance, in each case an intermediate piece (41, 42) held in a rotationally locked manner is inserted between the outer component (21) and the inner component (31). The intermediate piece (41, 42) is provided with a passage (45 or 46), is laterally supported on one of the components via in each case radially directed sealing gaps (47, 48 and 49, 50 resp.) and is adjustable relative to the other component (21). This ensures that the two components (21, 31) are not directly supported on one another and do not enclose an axial sealing gap, but nonetheless transmission of pressurized medium is possible. Positional changes of the components (21, 31) are also automatically compensated for and positional inaccuracies cannot have an adverse effect.

An arrangement (1) for the transmission of a pressurised medium,
comprising an external component (21) with a fixed support and located

in an internal component (31) which can be driven so as to rotate, with
the external and internal components being arranged one inside the

other and having ducts (26, 27 or 36, 37) for pressurised medium facing
one another, in which the external component (21) is attached directly or

via intermediate elements (12) to a housing (2) or an operating machine
(M) and the internal component (31) is located at a radial distance from

the external component (21) and is attached directly or via intermediate
elements (5) to a spindle (3) which is mounted in the housing (2) in such

a way that it is able to rotate,
characterised in that,

in order to compensate for the radial protrusion, an intermediate piece
(41, 42) formed from a closed, rigid ring (43, 44) made from a metallic

material and held so it is prevented from rotating is inserted between the
external component (21) and the internal component (31) in the area of

the ducts (26, 27 or 36, 37) for pressurised medium which are produced
facing one another in the internal and external components, with the

intermediate piece (41, 42) having at least one duct (45 or 46) for
connecting a duct (26 or 27) for pressurised medium of the external

component (21) to a duct (36 or 37) for pressurised medium of the 
internal component (31), and being supported sideways on one of the

components (31), preferably the internal component, by means of two
radially aligned sealing gaps (47, 48 or 49, 50) and mounted on the other

component (21) so it can be moved axially, and that an annular groove
(51 or 52) is enclosed by each of the two radially aligned sealing gaps

(47, 48 or 49, 50).
The arrangement in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that,

the intermediate pieces (41, 42) are arranged at a radial distance from
the internal component (31) and form the radially aligned sealing gap (46,

47 or 48, 49) in conjunction with protrusions (38, 39, part 34) from the
internal component (31).
The arrangement in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that,

the internal component (31) is composed of two or three parts (32, 33,
34) attached to the spindle (3) which encompass one or more annular

grooves (51, 52) into which the intermediate pieces (41, 42) supported on
the fixed component (21) engage. 
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,

when pressurised medium is supplied directly from the external
component (21) into the intermediate pieces (41, 42), the axial gap

between the intermediate pieces (41, 42) and the external component
(21) is sealed by sealing rings (55, 56) inserted into both sides of the duct

(45, 46) worked into the intermediate pieces (41, 42).
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,

the intermediate pieces (41', 42') are each movably guided on a guidance
element (61) formed as a pin (62) and arranged in parallel to the

longitudinal axis (A) of the spindle (3), with the guidance element (61)
being supported on the fixed component (21) and providing a means by

which the pressurised medium can be supplied to the corresponding
intermediate piece (41' or 42').
The arrangement in accordance with claim 5,
characterised in that,

the pin (62) is inserted between two parts (22, 23) which form the
external component (21) and has a duct (63) which is connected to the

duct (26') for pressurised medium of the external component (21) and
serves to supply the pressurised medium into the intermediate piece

(41'). 
The arrangement in accordance with claim 6,
characterised in that,

one end of the pin (62) is in contact with the part (23) of the external
component (21) which has the duct (26') for pressurised medium, with

this contact being effected via a seal (64) inserted in the pin (62), and
that the other end (65) of the pin (63) has a curved, convex shape.
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that,

each of the intermediate pieces (41', 42') is supported against the
external component (21) by means of a convex, curved external jacket

surface (67).
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that,

a collecting chamber (53, 54) for pressurised medium connected to a
return line (28) is provided on both sides of one or two intermediate

pieces (41, 42).
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that,
 
the intermediate pieces (41, 42 or 41', 42') are prevented from rotating by

pins (57, 57') which are inserted in the external component (21) and

intermediate pieces (41, 42 or 41', 42').
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that,

the external component (21) is attached to the housing (2), preferably to
the spindle stock of the working machine (1), by means of a bell (13) or a

similar intermediate element (12').
The arrangement in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that,

the internal component (31) is directly fixed to the spindle (3) of the
working machine or to a cylinder (6) of a servo device 
(5) which is
