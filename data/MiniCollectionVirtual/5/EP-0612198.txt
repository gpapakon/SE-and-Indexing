<ABSTRACT>
An electrical heating element for a radiant electric 
heater comprises an elongate electrically conductive 

strip (1) for partial embedding edgewise in a base (3) of 
thermal and electrical insulation material. The strip 

(1) is composed of an elongate continuous portion and an 
elongate discontinuous portion integral with the 

continuous portion. The discontinuous portion is 
intended for embedding in the base (3) and is provided 

with a plurality of discontinuities (4, 4A, 4B, 4C) 
therein such that in operation of the heater current flow 

in the discontinuous portion is reduced or eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
radiant electric heater, more particularly, but not
exclusively, for use with a glass-ceramic smooth top
cooker. More particularly, the invention relates to a
method of manufacturing a radiant electric heater
incorporating an electrical heating element in the form of
an elongate strip of electrically conductive material, such
as a metal or a metal alloy, partially embedded edgewise in
a base of compacted microporous thermal and electrical insulation
material. The invention also relates to a radiant electric
heater made by such a method.The term 'microporous' is used herein to identify porous or
cellular materials in which the ultimate size of the cells
or voids is less than the mean free path of an air molecule
at NTP, i.e. of the order of 100 nm or smaller. A material
which is microporous in this sense will exhibit very low
transfer of heat by air conduction (that is collisions
between air molecules). Such microporous materials include
aerogel, which is a gel in which the liquid phase has been
replaced by a gaseous phase in such a way as to avoid the
shrinkage which would occur if the gel were dried directly
from a liquid. A substantially identical structure can be
obtained by controlled precipitation from solution, the
temperature and pH being controlled during precipitation to
obtain an open lattice precipitate. Other equivalent open 
lattice structures include pyrogenic (fumed) and electro-thermal
types in which a substantial proportion of the
particles have an ultimate particle size less than 100 nm.
Any of these particulate materials, based for example on
silica, alumina or other metal oxides, may be used to
prepare a composition which is microporous as defined
above.The microporous insulation typically comprises a dry
particulate microporous material as defined hereinabove
mixed with ceramic fibre reinforcement, titanium dioxide
opacifier and, for high-temperature use, a small quantity
of alumina powder to resist shrinkage. Such microporous
insulation material is described in GB-A-1 580 909.When a heating element in the form of an elongate strip of
electrically conductive material is partially embedded
edgewise into a base of insulation material, such as
microporous thermal and electrical insulation material, to
form a radiant heater, during operation of the heater the
strip reaches a high temperature required for satisfactory
operation of the heater. However, the entire strip
comprising exposed and embedded regions operates at a high
temperatu
