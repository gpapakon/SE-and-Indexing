<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus and method for removing trace 
contaminants from the surface of a chosen substrate, such 

as delicate surfaces or precision parts, wherein the 
improvement consists of heating a portion of a chosen 

substrate surface immediately before, during and/or after 
application of a stream of cleaning snow to the same 

portion of the substrate surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus
and methods for use in the precision cleaning of substrate
surfaces. More particularly, the present invention
relates to apparatus and methods for removing trace
contaminants from delicate surfaces and precision hardware
such as that found in high sensitivity optical, electronic
and precision mechanical equipment.It is essential that delicate and precision surfaces
of optical-mechanical-electronic equipment be contaminant-free.
For example, infrared optical sensor systems use
thin film optical coatings to enhance in-band
transmittance and reject out-of-band radiation. Even
trace amounts of contaminations degrade spectral
performance by scattering, absorbing, or reflecting
incident radiation.Particulate and molecular contaminants present on
optical surfaces can cause problems by changing emittance
characteristics thereby increasing thermal noise in
optical devices. Dust and debris contamination present on
a detector surface may also generate clutter in the
appearance of false targets. Further, the presence of
molecular contaminants on precision optical equipment
surfaces, such as lenses, windows and optical filters,
results in the absorption and scatter of incident energy
with the resultant decrease in system quality.In precision computer and gyroscope equipment,
particulate contamination in a moving disk drive or in a 
spinning gyroscope stator may damage or disable such a
system beyond repair. Technologies used in manufacturing
integrated circuits also require that substrates be free
of particulates and molecular contaminants.Precision cleaning apparatus and methods are not
limited in use to high technology applications. For
example, the presence of particulate and molecular
contaminants on such substrates as automobile body panels
impairs the integrity of the coatings applied thereon and
may result in peeling or bubbling of the coated surface.A wide variety of cleaning solvents and solutions,
such as chlorofluorocarbons and ketones, have been
utilized to clean delicate surfaces. However, the
majority of these cleaning solutions and solvents are
environmentally hazardous. In response to these
environmental concerns, a number of environmentally safe
cleaning mediums had been proposed, one of which is carbon
dioxide.More particularly, a variety of investigators have
reported utilizing a stream or jet spray of carbon
dioxide, also known as "dry ice snow", to remove molecular
and particular contaminants from a variety of surfaces
including silicon

<CLAIMS>
A method for precision cleaning the surface of a
substrate wherein a stream of cleaning snow is directed

against a chosen substrate surface to remove contaminants
located thereon and wherein the substrate is heated,

characterized by

directing a stream of heating gas to heat a selected
portion of the substrate surface before application of said

stream of cleaning snow to said selected portion of said
substrate surface, wherein the streams of heating gas and

cleaning snow are individual streams of heating gas and
cleaning snow that are independently orientable.
The method of claim 1 wherein said selected portion of
said substrate surface is heated by applying said first

stream of heating gas to a first elevated temperature which
is sufficient to enhance removal of contaminants from said

selected portion of said substrate without damaging said
substrate.
The method of claim 2 further comprising the step of
reheating said selected portion of said substrate surface

after application of said stream of cleaning snow to said
selected portion of said substrate surface by applying a

second stream of heating gas to said selected portion of
said substrate after application of said stream of cleaning

snow to said selected portion of said substrate.
The method of claim 3 wherein said selected portion of
said substrate surface is reheated by applying said second

stream of heating gas to a second elevated temperature
which is sufficient to inhibit the formation of condensates

on said selected portion of said substrate surface. 
An apparatus for removing contaminants from the
surface of a chosen substrate comprising:


a first spray device (20) for producing a stream of
cleaning snow;
means for directing said stream of cleaning snow to a
selected portion of said substrate surface;

   characterized by
a second spray device (40;122) for producing a first
stream of heating gas; and
means for directing said first stream of heating gas
to said selected portion of said substrate surface, wherein

said means for directing the streams of heating gas and
cleaning snow are independently orientable for providing

individual streams of heating gas and cleaning snow that
are independently orientable.
The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said first spray
device is positioned relative to said second spray device

such that, if said apparatus is moved in a direction
parallel to said substrate surface, said first stream of

heating gas will engage said selected portion of said
substrate surface before, during of after said stream of

cleaning snow engages said selected portion of said
substrate surface.
The apparatus of claim 5 further comprising a third
spray device (124) for producing a second stream of heating

gas and means for directing said second stream of heating
gas to said selected portion of said substrate surface,

said third spray device (124) being positioned relative to
said first (20) and second (122) spray devices such that,

if said apparatus is moved in a direction parallel to said
substrate surface, said first stream of heating gas will

engage said selected portion of said substrate surface
before said stream of cleaning snow engages said selected

portion of said substrate surface and said second stream of 
heating gas will engage said selected portion of said

substrate surface after said stream of cleaning snow
engages said selected portion of substrate surface.
