<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for stabilising particulate alkali metal peroxo (peroxy) salts by coating with a solid coating material and the particulate alkali metal peroxo salts, stabilised by coating, thus obtained. The coating material comprises a crystallised mineral salt mixture of alkali metal sulphate and alkali metal chloride, which can, if desired, additionally contain alkali metal silicate. Suitable alkali metal peroxo salts are peroxopyrophosphate, peroxotripolyphosphate, peroxomonosulphate, but in particular peroxocarbonate.
