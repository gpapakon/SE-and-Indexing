<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drip dispenser for
dispensing fluids, particularly detergents, antiseptics, and
fragrance enhancers, to toilets and the like.Most drip dispensers include a backplate and a front
cover. The front cover is either hinged to the backplate by a
single visible and accessible hinge or is removable. The cover
conceals a reservoir which receives a livid to be dispensed
and incorporates a delivery system that allows the liquid to be
dispensed slowly, normally a drop at a time. Because most drip
dispensers have more than one major component, the joining of
these components with some type of fastening device or material
is typically required.Various attempts have been made to overcome the
disadvantages of multi-piece construction. Commercially
available dispensers incorporate a single living hinge to
achieve a single molding objective. However, this hinge, which
attaches a backplate to a cover, is visible when the dispenser
is in a mounted position. Additionally, there is an unsightly
opening between the cover and the backplate along the side
opposite to the hinge and along the top and the bottom of the
dispenser. The hinge becomes increasingly unsightly with age
and wear.Tampering is another problem to which drip dispensers
are susceptible. Tampering typically results in loss of the
contents of the dispenser and/or damage to the dispenser 
itself. Consequently, most drip dispensers incorporate
some type of locking device. Typically, locking devices
require obvious holes or gaps in the body of the
dispenser where a key or some other tool is inserted.The dispenser described above, for example, has a
small widened area at the junction of the backplate and
the cover into which a tool is inserted to release the
cover from a catch attached to the backplate. Because
the opening is readily visible and accessible, the cover
can be pried open with a screwdriver or the like.Other commercially available dispensers require a
key or a special tool to open the unit. The key is
inserted into a hole in the bottom of the dispenser.
However, such dispensers are susceptible to opening when
they are hit sharply in an upward direction.
Alternatively, the key opening may become plugged,
thereby preventing servicing of the dispenser.According to the present invention there is provided
a drip dispenser comprising:
(a) a backplate for securing said dispenser to a
support, said backplate having a first longitudinal edge
having at least one cover locking means, a hinge bearing
longitudinal edge, at least one hinge
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A drip dispenser (1) comprising:

(a) a backplate (5) for securing said dispenser to a
support, said backplate having a first longitudinal edge (21)

having at least one cover locking means (27), a hinge bearing
longitudinal edge (23), at least one hinge locking port (37),

and a liquid storage container support means (31);
(b) a liquid reservoir (7) attached to said backplate,
said liquid reservoir having a drip outlet (51) for dispensing

a liquid from said dispenser (1); and
(c) a cover (3) having a first longitudinal edge (45), a
hinge bearing longitudinal edge (41) having at least one hinge

locking means, and at least one covering locking means
receptacle (47);

wherein said backplate and said cover are joined along
their respective hinge bearing longitudinal edges by a trifold

hinge which can be maintained in a single folded position by
inserting said hinge locking means into said hinge locking

port and in a trifolded position at which said cover
completely covers said backplate and said reservoir, at which

said cover is flush with any support on which said dispenser
is secured with no spaces or hinges visible, and at which said

cover locking means engages said cover locking means

receptacle.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 wherein said
drip outlet is in communication with a dispensing means

comprising;

a) a hollow tube (53), having at least one annular or
semi-annular groove around at least a portion of the outer

circumference of said tube, said groove being adapted to
engage a locking means; and
b) a locking means (55) attached to said dispenser,
said locking means being adapted to engage said groove of said

tube so that said tube cannot be moved along its length with
respect to said locking means.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 2 wherein said 
reservoir (7) comprises a first chamber (59) for receiving

liquid from a liquid container and a second chamber (61)
having said drip outlet in communication with said dispensing

means, said two chambers (59, 61) being in communication
through a wick (63) adapted to draw a liquid from said first

chamber to said second chamber.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 that is one
piece.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 4 that is
molded.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 constructed from
polypropylene.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 wherein said
liquid container support means (31) comprises arms adapted to

lock into corresponding grooves on a liquid storage container.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 wherein said
cover (3) comprises Z-shaped louvers.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 2 wherein said
tube is constructed from polyethylene.
A drip dispenser as defined in claim 1 wherein said
cover locking means (27) comprises two prongs, said prongs

each having an arm and a tip that extends outwardly of the
arm, and said cover locking means receptacle being sized and

proportioned to be positioned below said tips of said arms
when in the locked position, but wherein said cover may be

moved a distance sufficient to permit the insertion of a key
to compress said arms, and therefore said tips, to unlock said

cover. 
A drip dispensing system comprising a drip dispenser
(1) as defined in claim 1, and a liquid container adapted to

lock onto said liquid container support means.
A drip dispensing system as defined in claim 11
wherein said liquid container is capped by a check stopper

mechanism adapted to control the flow of any liquid from said
container.
