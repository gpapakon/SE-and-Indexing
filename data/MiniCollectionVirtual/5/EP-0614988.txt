<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a new method of identifying fast-hybridizing 
single-stranded polynucleotides. Antisense nucleic acid-mediated control of gene expression and viral replication 
plays an increasingly significant role in vivo and in tissue culture cells. Two 
classes of antisense nucleic acids which differ in the specific form of application 
to living cells have been used. Relatively short synthetic and in many cases 
chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides have been applied successfully 
as well as long antisense RNAs synthesized in vitro or, in most cases, expressed 
intracellularly from antisense genes. Despite the great number of 
phenomenological descriptions of convincing biological effects obtained with 
antisense nucleic acids, unequivocal experimental evidence for the antisense 
principle has not been reported as frequently. In particular for eucaryotic 
antisense RNAs, systematic mechanistic analyses of double strand formation 
with target RNA in vitro and in vivo are lacking. In contrast to this, prokaryotic 
antisense RNA-regulated examples have been studied in more detail. For the 
antisense RNA-regulated plasmid copy number in E. coli it has been shown that 
the kinetic behaviour of antisense RNA in vitro is in agreement with the 
effectiveness in vivo (Tomizawa, J.I. and Som, T (1984) Cell 38, 871-878). 
For 
replication of plasmid R1, the kinetic situation for binding of antisense RNA to 
target RNA appears to reflect RNA-mediated control in vivo (Nordström, K et al. 
(1988) Gene 72, 237 - 240). Further structural properties of individual 
antisense RNAs determine hybridization kinetics in vitro (Persson, C. et al. 
(1990) EMBO J., 9, 3767 - 3375) and are linked with biological effects, e.g. 
plasmid copy numbers (Novick, R.P. (1987) Microbiol. Rev. 51, 381 - 395; 
Polsky, B. (1988) Cell, 55, 929 - 932). In principle these findings are also 
relevant for other antisense RNA-regulated or -inhibited systems, including 
eucaryotic ones (Inouye, M. (1988) Gene, 72, 25-34). The biological system in  
 
which most of the reported studies with antisense RNA have been conducted 
include the antisense RNA-mediated inhibition of the human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication (Sczakiel, G., Pawlita, M & Kleinheinz, A. (1990) 
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 169, 643-651). We have now investigated kinetic properties in vitro of a HIV-1-directed 
antisense RNA (αY150) which was shown to inhibit viral replication. For a 
systematic analysis, individual
