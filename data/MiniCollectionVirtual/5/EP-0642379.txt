<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a method to purify gases, such as combustion gases, in which method oxides of nitrogen and sulphur are converted into solid particles by an electron beam coming from an electron source (1) with the aid of added base. By the present methods oxides of nitrogen and sulphur cannot be removed effectively. In the method of the invention particles charged in the electron beam are guided with an external electric field to gather on a collection sheet (5) into a layer (7) which can be cleaned at desired time periods.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD TO PURIFY GASESThe object of the invention is a method to purify gases, such as combustion gases, in which method oxides of nitrogen and sulphur are converted into solid particles by an electron beam coming from an electron source, with the aid of added alkaline.The mostly used method to purify combustion gases these days is a method, in which an electric filter is used to remove the solid particles, and slaked lime, which binds to itself part of the sulphur oxide formed during the burning process, is fed into the furnace of the boiler. This slaked lime dust is then filtered off in the electric filter with all the other solid particles. Usually nitrogen oxides are not even attempted to be removed, but the burning process is designed such that the temperature is low all the time, which reduces the amount of nitrogen oxides produced. In principle the lowered temperature does not reduce the amount of heath produced, but, because power plants generally produce electricity, according to the theoretical Carnot's machine the efficiency of electricity production is reduced as the temperature difference used by the machine is reduced. The efficiency of the Carnot's machine is (T2 - i)/T2 (T2 > Tx), that is, the temperature of the boiler can not be lowered very much without a significant reduction in efficiency. Power plants have also been designed, in which the combustion gases would be in such a high temperature that they would already be so strongly ionized, that electricity could be formed directly from these charge carriers by separating them into collection surfaces of opposite charge with the aid of a magnetic field. Then, if there is nitrogen present, it certainly burns into oxide. By adding washing methods of combustion gases, of which wet washing is most general, to the above described primary purification methods, 80 % of sulphur can usually be removed. Even with these washing methods nitrogen oxides can not be removed 

 without expensive special chemicals. A great disadvantage of the wet washing methods is also a huge amount of dirty water which is usually cleaned and recycled.Today electric filters are good in removing solid material sufficiently. Perhaps their greatest disadvantages are the duration age of the wires used in the corona discharge, and keeping the corona discharge voltage at the breakdown level.The aim of the invention is to achieve a method to purify gases, which in addition to removing solid material also efficiently removes S02 and most of NO.The aim of the invention is
