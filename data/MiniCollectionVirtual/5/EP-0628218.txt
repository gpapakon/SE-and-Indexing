<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to decametric wave antennas comprising a vertical sheet of doublets. In a same vertical curtain are gathered the doublets (D1-D4) of the antenna and the supply cable (Ca) for said doublets, in order to form an assembly which may be totally pre-assembled, including the electric connections, before it is lifted by means of pulleys (Pd), to the carrier structure of the antenna. Furthermore, in said assembly, the supply cable is arranged so as to contribute to the support of the doublets. Application to fixed or rotary decametric wave antennas.
