<ABSTRACT>
Process making it possible to apply guniting or casting of refractory material and which applies more particularly to the restoration or repair of refractory linings in blast furnaces. The characteristic of the invention lies in the fact that studs are embedded in the cast iron of the staves after the latter has been heated in the embedding zone for at least 20 seconds with the aid of an oxyhydrogen blowtorch. These studs are provided with a threaded head which allows the anchorages to be secured by bolting.
