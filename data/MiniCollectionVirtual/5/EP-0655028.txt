<ABSTRACT>
The shuttering has side walls (5) which can be pivoted away and a rib on each side wall (5) facing inwards and forming a groove for a sealing frame in the tubbing produced therein. Said rib has a rib bearer (13) which is distant from the side wall (5) and forms recesses (14) therewith. Into each recess is inserted a shaping rib (15) which completes the rib bearer (13) to form a rib. The shaping ribs are elastically deformable. Thus when the side walls (5) and hence the ribs are pivoted away, not only is damage to the tubbing groove just produced prevented but also noses (17) forming recesses in the groove can be provided which are inconceivable in non-deformable ribs owing to the impossibility of moving them out of the recesses.

<CLAIMS>
A casing for producing tunnel linings, with a bottom (1) and, with around this 
bottom and adapted to pivot away from it, side walls (5) which comprise one or 

more ribs projecting towards the interior of the casing and serving to form one or 
more grooves (12') in the lining to be produced in the casing, characterised in that 

each rib consists of a rib member (13) which forms between itself and the side wall 
(5) on which it is mounted at least one depression (14) and a shaping rib (15) 

anchored in this depression and at least filling it and which permits of an elastic 
deformation of the rib. 
A casing according to claim 1, characterised in that the shaping rib (15) consists 
of elastically deformable material. 
A casing according to claim 3, characterised in that the shaping rib has in its 
interior a cavity (18, 18') which allows the elastic deformation to take place. 
A casing according to claim 3, characterised in that the shaping rib (15) consists 
of a base (15a) anchored in the depression (14) by means of lips (16) and of a head 

(15b) mounted on it outside the depression (14) and comprising the cavity (18, 
18'). 
A casing according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
shaping rib (15) has on one side a nose (17) intended to form a niche (19) in the 

groove (12') of the lining in order to anchor an appropriately formed sealing frame 
which is fitted into this groove (12'). 
A casing according to claim 1, characterised in that the rib member (13) has a T-shape 
of which the web is mounted on the side wall (5) and which, with it, the web 

and the two beams extending from its other end and parallel with the side wall,  
 

forms two depressions (14) in which two shaping ribs (15) are disposed in mirror 
image of each other. 
A casing according to claim 4, characterised in that the cavity (18') is so formed 
that it has in the head (15b) a zone (15d) which widens away in the direction from 

the base (15a) and, disposed between this latter and the transition zone between 
base (15a) and head (15b), a zone (15c) which in comparison with the widening 

zone (15d) and the transition zone, is thinner so that upon elastic deformation of 
the rib, it can serve as a hinge for the pivoting movement of the latter zone (15d) 

about it (15c).
