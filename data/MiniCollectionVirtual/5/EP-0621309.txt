<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber composition 
for vibration insulator rubbers, and to a vibration 
insulator rubber obtained therefrom. More particularly, it 
relates to an ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated diene 
copolymer rubber composition having a good kneading 
processability, and to a vibration insulator rubber 
prepared therefrom, which has a good dynamic/static ratio 
characteristic and a prolonged stretch fatigue life. It has been known that ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated 
diene copolymer rubbers, such as an ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated 
diene rubber, are excellent in 
thermal aging resistance, ozone resistance and polar solvent 
resistance. The dynamic/static ratio property, i.e. damping 
property is one of the most important properties required 
for vibration insulator rubbers. The dynamic/static ratio 
is defined as the ratio of the dynamic spring constant to 
the static spring constant of a vibration insulator rubber.
 
   The dynamic/static ratio, which is always larger than 1, 
indicates the degree of frequency dependence of vibration 
insulating performance. The higher the dynamic/static ratio 
a vibration insulator rubber has, the higher the frequency 
dependence the vibration insulator rubber suffers in its 
vibration insulating performance. Accordingly, having a high frequency dependence is  
 
disadvantageous for a vibration insulator rubber because, 
when a vibration insulator rubber designed to exert maximum 
vibration insulating effects at a certain range of frequency 
is loaded with vibrations of frequencies outside said 
frequency range, the vibration insulator rubber does not 
exert a sufficient vibration insulating effect. In other words, vibration insulator rubbers should 
exert a satisfactory vibration insulating effect against 
vibrations of a wide range of frequencies and hence should 
have a low dynamic/static ratio. This is very important, 
especially for vibration insulator rubbers which are 
employed under conditions where the frequency of vibrations 
varies, e.g. vibration insulator rubbers for automobiles in 
which the frequency of vibrations varies depending on the 
number of revolutions of the engine, and vibration 
insulator rubbers for washing machines where the frequency 
of vibrations varies depending on the number of revolutions 
of the motor. Moreover, since stretching stresses are repeatedly 
loaded on vibration insulator rubbers, the rubbers should 
have a prolonged stretch fatigue life. They should also 
have a good kneading processability
