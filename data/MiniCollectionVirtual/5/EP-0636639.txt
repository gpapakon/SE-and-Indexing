<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copolymers of aromatic
anhydrides and aliphatic esters. More specifically, it
relates to copolymers of aromatic anhydrides and
aliphatic esters particularly well suited for melt
processing to prepare biomedical devices, especially
wound closure devices.Polymers of aliphatic and aromatic anhydrides have been
extensively studied for many years. As long ago as the
1930's, Carothers had prepared a series of aliphatic
polyanhydrides for use as fibers in the textile industry
(see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 54, 1569 (1932)). Later, in the
mid 1950's, Conix was able to synthesize aromatic
polyanhydrides with improved film and fiber forming
properties (see J. Polym. Sci., 29 343 (1958)).
However, these early attempts to make polyanhydrides
with outstanding properties were unsuccessful because
these polyanhydrides exhibited poor thermal and
hydrolytic stability. Therefore, during this time, no
commercial applications of polyanhydrides were found.More recently polyanhydrides with sustained drug release
properties have been made. U.S. Patent 4,757,128, and
Domb et al., J. of Polymer Sci., 25, 3373 (1987),
disclose the preparation of polyanhydrides from pure, 
isolated prepolymers of diacids and acetic acid under
well defined polymerization reaction conditions of
temperature and time, optionally in the presence of a
coordination catalyst. The molecular weight of the
polyanhydrides prepared from the isolated prepolymers is
reported to be higher than that achieved when an
unisolated prepolymer mixture is used. However, as
stated by Domb et al., the polyanhydrides depolymerize
to form a rubbery gel if the polymerization temperature
is maintained at elevated temperatures for an extended
period of time.The synthesis techniques described by Domb have lead to
the use of polyanhydrides as biodegradable matrices for
the controlled release of biologically active
substances. See, for example, U.S. Patent 4,857,311,
and U.S. Patent 4,888,176. One of the factors which
make a polyanhydride particularly well suited as a
biodegradable matrix is that it breaks down into
biocompatible degradation products based on the
monomeric diacids when exposed to moist bodily tissue
for extended periods of time. These biocompatible
degradation products can be readily passed through the
tissue without any significant tissue response or harm
to the digestive or vascular systems.Recent attempts have been made to optimize the synthesis
of anhydride copolymers. Specifically, anhydride
copolymers which will exhibit longer release
