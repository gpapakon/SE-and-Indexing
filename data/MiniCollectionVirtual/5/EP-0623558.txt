<ABSTRACT>
In a device for purifying and treating dirty waters by electrolysis, which device is composed of at least two tubes, each arranged centrally, made of iron and/or aluminium having a concentric inlet nozzle, one tube being connected as a cathode and the other as an anode and the annular space between the two tubes being the reaction space for dirty water flowing through, it is proposed to connect the cathode and the anode so that their polarity may be reversed. Reversing the polarity of the electric field enables deposits on the electrodes of the reactor to be dissolved in a simple manner and to be washed out of the reaction space by the treated dirty water.
