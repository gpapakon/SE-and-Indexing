<ABSTRACT>
A battery pack (P) for a portable or notebook computer 
is designed to eliminate substantially hard wiring 

components and includes a generally rectangular housing 
(10) having an opening (O) in the bottom (10a). The 

opening in the bottom receives a support chassis (20) which 
mounts a series of electrical contact points (21) for 

interfacing with the main computer housing. The support 
chassis mounts a printed circuit board (30) which receives 

the electrical contact points for electrical connection to 
the various components of the printed circuit board such 

that electrical connection is made between the array of 
batteries (12a-f) and the main computer housing utilizing 

a series of electrical surface contact points rather than 
hard wiring, which preserves space and reduces 

manufacturing costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery pack for a 
portable computer wherein the battery pack has a minimum 
number of hard wire connections. There is currently a trend in personal computers today 
toward portables such as notebook-size portables and even 
smaller computers. These small portable computers need a 
battery operated power supply utilizing rechargeable 
batteries. In order to monitor such rechargeable batteries 
and recharge in a timely and proper manner, it is known to 
hard wire into the battery pack a number of electronic 
components such as for example a temperature sensor and a 
microcomputer or memory to monitor various battery 
operations and maintain battery information. Examples of 
the electronics for monitoring and recharging a battery 
pack for a computer system are found in EP-A-0 577 810 
entitled "Battery Charge Monitor and Fuel Gauge" and 
EP-A-0 616 281 entitled "Battery Pack Including Static 
Memory and a Timer For Charged Management" owned by Compaq 
Computer Corporation, the present applicant. Hard wiring various circuits within the battery pack 
is expensive and time-consuming since all of the hard 
wiring must be done by hand. The combination of hand 
soldering and hand installation adds significant additional 
manpower to manufacture of such battery packs. Further, 
the necessity of hard wiring within a battery pack adds 
additional space to the overall battery pack housing in 
order to mount such hard wiring within the battery pack 
housing. It is an object of this invention to provide a battery 
pack for portable computer systems wherein the battery pack 
is interfaced with the main computer housing with a minimum 
amount of hard wiring, which reduces manufacturing costs 
and allows the overall battery pack housing to be smaller 
in size. The battery pack of this invention includes a  
 
generally rectangular housing which includes a bottom 
having an opening therein. The housing is sized to receive 
a plurality of batteries for providing power to the 
portable computer. A support chassis is mounted with the 
housing and includes a plurality of mounting slots, which 
mounting slots receive individual, electrical contacts. 
The support chassis is mounted over the opening in the 
bottom of the housing such that the electrical contacts are 
aligned with the housing bottom opening and are thus 
exposed for making electrical contact with circuitry of the 
main computer housing. A printed circuit board is attached 
to the support chassis. The printed circuit board

connection with the electronic components, and the 
electronic components (40) being electrically connected to 

the batteries such that various electronic circuits are 
made from the batteries through the electronic components 

and electrical contacts to the computer. 
The battery pack of claim 1, including: 
   a thermistor (23) mounted with the support chassis so 

as to be located in close proximity to the batteries 
(12a-f) to sense the temperature of said batteries, the 

thermistor including first and second terminals (23a) which 
 

extend through openings in the printed circuit board in 
order to be electrically connected to said electronic 

components. 
The battery pack of claim 1 or claim 2, including: 
   first and second hard wires (41,42) extending from 

electrical connection to said electronic components (40) of 
said printed circuit board into electrical connection with 

said batteries (12a-f). 
The battery pack of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein: 
   said support chassis (20) includes a generally
