<ABSTRACT>
A process of electroplating comprising formation of a semiconductive 
coating over an article having both metallic and non-metallic portions, dissolving 

the metal surface underlying the semiconductive coating and removing the 
semiconductive coating by a high pressure water spray. The process is useful for 

the formation of printed circuit boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electroplating nonconductors, and more particularly,
to processes for electroplating the surface of a nonconductor having a
semiconductive coating over its surface. The invention is especially useful in the
manufacture of printed circuit boards by a process involving passage of the boards
through an apparatus, preferably in a horizontal mode.Nonconducting surfaces are conventionally metallized by a sequence of
steps comprising catalysis of the surface of a nonconductor to render the same
catalytic to electroless metal deposition followed by contact of the catalyzed
surface with an electroless plating solution that deposits metal over the catalyzed
surface in the absence of an external source of electricity. Metal plating continues
for a time sufficient to form a metal deposit of the desired thickness. Following
electroless metal deposition, the electroless metal deposit is optionally enhanced by
electrodeposition of a metal over the electroless metal coating to a desired
thickness. Electrolytic deposition is possible because the electroless metal deposit
serves as a conductive coating that permits electroplating. Catalyst compositions useful for electroless metal plating are known in the
art and disclosed in numerous publications including US-A-3,011,920.
The catalyst of this patent consists of an
aqueous suspension of a tin - noble or precious (catalytic) metal colloid.Electroless plating solutions are aqueous solutions containing both a
dissolved metal and a reducing agent in solution. The presence of the dissolved
metal and reducing agent together in solution results in plate-out of metal in
contact with a catalytic metal tin catalyst. However, the presence of the dissolved
metal and reducing agent together in solution can also result in solution instability
and indiscriminate deposition of metal on the walls of containers for such plating
solutions. This may necessitate interruption of the plating operation, removal of
the plating solution from the tank and cleaning of tank walls and bottoms by means
of an etching operation. Indiscriminate deposition may be avoided by careful
control of the plating solution during use and by use of stabilizers in solution which
inhibit indiscriminate deposition, but which also retard plating rate.Attempts have been made in the past to avoid the use of an electroless
plating solution by a direct plating process whereby a metal is deposited directly
over a treated nonconductive surface. One such process is disclosed in
US-A-3,099,608. The
