<ABSTRACT>
A diffusion code generating method for a code 
division multiplex communication by a spread spectrum 

system is provided. A receiving apparatus according to 
the above method receives the signal which was 

multiplexed by using a plurality of sets of diffusion 
codes and comprises: a generator to generate a sync code 

and a plurality of sets of diffusion codes other than the 
sync code; a correlator to obtain a correlation between a 

reception signal and the sync code generated from the 
generator; and a receiver to receive the reception signal 

on the basis of the plurality of sets of diffusion codes 
generated from the generator. The generator generates 

the sync code in a manner such that the cross-correlation 
values are set to very small values at positions near a 

code sync point or are enough smaller than the 
autocorrelation peak of the sync code or are set to very 

small values at both of or either one of the positions 
before and after the code sync point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diffusion code
generating method for a code division multiplex
communication by a spread spectrum system.In a spread spectrum communication, there is
considered a code division multiplex communication system
in which by using low cross-correlation characteristics
of diffusion codes, a plurality of communication paths
are multiplexed in the same band and a information
transmission speed is raised.Especially in the code division multiplex
communication of a synchronization system, by using
orthogonal series in which cross-correlation values are
equal to zero as diffusion codes, an interference between
the codes can be completely eliminated. For example,
there is a code division multiplex
modulation/demodulation apparatus of the type in which a
synchronization clock is individually given by a wire
system by using orthogonal codes comprising M series.In a wireless spread spectrum communication,
however, a demodulator has to obtain a code 
synchronization from the reception signal. Therefore, a
receiver generally has a correlator, a diffused reception
signal and a diffusion code for synchronization are input
to the correlator, and an autocorrelation peak of an
output waveform of the correlator is detected, thereby
capturing and holding the code synchronization of the
diffusion codes.In the case where a communication path is
multiplexed by a code division multiplex by using a
plurality of orthogonal codes, the periodic cross-correlation
between the orthogonal codes which are used
for synchronization and the other orthogonal codes
appears as noises in an output of the correlator.
Generally, there are positions where the periodic cross-correlation
values of the orthogonal codes are not equal
to zero at positions out of the synchronization point
(when the phase is deviated). When the number of code
division multiplexes increases, the cross-correlation
values from the other channels for the synchronization
channel are accumulated and the noise level increases.In the communication by the PSK modulation, the
accumulated cross-correlation value is largely fluctuated
by the information bits of each channel. As a result, the
output of the correlator on the reception side has large
values at random at positions out of the synchronization
point, so that it is difficult to discriminate the
autocorrelation peak of the synchronization channel. Now assuming that the code synchronization could be
captured, in order to hold the synchronization after
that, a synchronization point (or sync
