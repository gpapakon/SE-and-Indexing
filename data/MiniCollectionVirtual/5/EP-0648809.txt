<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to low-pilling and low-flammability phosphorus- and silicon-containing polyester mixtures comprising     from 10 to 90 % by weight of a phosphorus-containing polyester A,   from 90 to 10 % by weight of a silicon-containing polyester B and   from 0 to 80 % by weight of an unmodified polyester C, where the polyester A has been modified by addition of compounds of the formula I

 and the polyester B has been modified by addition of compounds of the formula II or III 
<

  where, in the formulae I, II and III,   R
<

 and R
<

 are identical or different and are each a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or together are a divalent hydrocarbon radical,   R

 are identical or different and are each hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, and the indices n is from 1 to 3, p is 0 or 1, y is from 1 to 10, z is 0 or an integer from 1 to 2*i and i is a sufficiently small integer.   The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of these polyester mixtures and to their use.
