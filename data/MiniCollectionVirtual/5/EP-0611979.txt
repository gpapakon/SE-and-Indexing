<ABSTRACT>
This relates to an opthalmic lens of the type in which, for the definition of two separate vision zones, one, (ZVL), corresponding to far vision and the other, (ZVP), corresponding to near vision, the curve representing the power as a function of the height h with respect to the axis (A) lies within a zone between a lower envelope curve and an upper envelope curve satisfying specified polynomial equations in which the coefficients depend on the addition of power corresponding to the degree of presbyopia of the wearer. According to the invention, either of the two vision zones (ZVL or ZVP) is enhanced with respect to the other, the corresponding areas SVL, SVP being related to each other by the following relationship:  for enhanced near vision:  1.8 
<
/= SVL DIVIDED SVP 
<
/= 3.6  and, for enhanced far vision:  4.74 
<
/= SVL DIVIDED SVP Application to the correction of presbyopia.
