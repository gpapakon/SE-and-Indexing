<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a delivery device for running threads, especially for use on textile machines, such as weaving looms or the like, with a storage drum (11), to which the thread (F) is fed in the rear region by means of a guide tube (9) circling round the storage drum and from which the thread (F) is drawn off overhead through a thread draw-off eye (19), the thread being guided radially inwards under the bristles of a brake ring (26). For an improvement in handling, particularly for a simplified axial brake-ring displacement accompanied by a variation in the braking effect, there is provision for the brake ring (26) to be capable of being brought by means of a compressed-air cylinder (22) into a position at a distance from the drum outer surface and to be capable of being returned again by spring force.
