<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a stencil printing sheet, in 
which the production of the stencil printing sheet is easy, 

a production cost thereof is reduced and there is no 
generation of any perforating failure at a time of 

plate-making, any wrinkles, any conveying failure and any 
printing failure, was disclosed. The process for producing 

the stencil printing sheet comprises the steps of laminating 
a solvent-soluble resin layer formed on a nonadhesive 

substrate to a porous substrate with an adhesive or by 
heat-adhesion, and then, removing the nonadhesive substrate 

described above from the solvent-soluble resin layer 
described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a
stencil printing sheet. Specifically, the present invention
relates to a process for producing a stencil printing sheet
having a solvent-soluble resin layer.In the prior art, a heat-sensitive stencil sheet is known
which is produced by laminating a thermoplastic resin film onto
a porous substrate with an adhesive. Stencil-making of this
heat-sensitive stencil sheet is carried out by means of (1) a
process of superposing a hand written or preliminarily prepared
manuscript onto a heat-sensitive stencil sheet and then
perforating by melting the thermoplastic resin film using the
heat generated from, for example, a flash lamp or an infrared
lamp (see for example US-A-4628813); and (2) a process of
bringing a thermal head which generates dot-like heat zones in
accordance with electrical signals from letter or picture
information, into contact with a heat-sensitive stencil sheet,
and perforating by melting the thermoplastic resin film (see for
example US-A-4568951).However, the stencil-making processes described above
require a complicated process of bringing either a manuscript
heated by irradiated light or a thermal head into contact with
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet, conducting the heat to the
thermoplastic resin film of the heat-sensitive stencil sheet to
melt the thermoplastic resin film and then shrinking the molten
material to perforate the thermoplastic resin film. These
stencil-making processes have the disadvantage that, for example,
(1) a perforating failure is produced on contact failure between
a thermoplastic resin film and a manuscript which has absorbed
heat of a thermal head; (2) a perforating failure is produced by
non-uniformity in the applied pressure of a thermal head,
resulting in wrinkles in a heat-sensitive stencil sheet; (3) the
molten material of a thermoplastic resin film was adhered to a
thermal head, resulting in a conveying failure of heat-sensitive
stencil sheet; and (4) since the molten material is left in a 
perforated portion, ink permeability is prevented, resulting in
printing failure.In recent years, a further improvement in quality of heat-sensitive
stencil sheet is demanded. It is demanded to provide
such a heat-sensitive stencil sheet that satisfies the smoothness
of a thermoplastic resin film, the separating property of the
thermoplastic resin film from the manuscript or thermal head, the
melting property due to heat and the shrinkability of a
thermoplastic resin film heat, the adhesive strength between a
