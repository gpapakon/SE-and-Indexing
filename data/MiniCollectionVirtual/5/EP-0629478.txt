<ABSTRACT>
A molding apparatus for a patterned shaped 
article (M) includes a retainer (1) having a plurality of 

retaining portions for retaining particles, a supply tank 
(12, 32, 53, 74, 83, 92, 94, 101) for charging particles 

(M₁) into the retainer, a remover (14, 5', 34, 55, 75, 84, 
93, 8', 102, 104) for removing the particles from some of 

the retaining portions of the retainer, and another supply 
tank (17, 5', 35, 38, 56, 78, 86, 92, 94, 103, 106) for 

charging particles of a different kind into the retaining 
portions from which the particles were removed. The 

apparatus produces a patterned shaped article by conducting 
at least one cycle of operation in which particles are 

charged into the retainer, the charged particles are 
removed from some of the retaining portions of the retainer 

and particles of a different kind are charged into the 
retaining portions from which the particles were removed, 

and releasing the particles retained by the retainer to 
form a course of prescribed thickness on a base surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a molding apparatus for 
patterned shaped articles and a method of using the molding 
apparatus for producing patterned concrete shaped articles, 
patterned artificial stone shaped articles, patterned raw 
products for sintering into ceramic shaped articles, 
patterned ceramic shaped articles, patterned metal shaped 
articles, patterned impasto shaped articles, patterned 
plastic shaped articles, patterned shaped foodstuffs and 
the like. Up to now the only way available for providing a 
part of a surface, such as of paving blocks, with a pattern 
indicating a crosswalk, a stop sign or other such traffic 
control mark or for providing the entire surface of the 
blocks with a pattern has been to paint the surface with a 
coating material such as paint or to inlay the desired 
pattern. Since the patterns painted on a part or all of 
the surface of paving blocks are exposed to abrasion from, 
for example, the shoes of pedestrians walking on the blocks 
and the tires of vehicles driving over them, they quickly 
wear off and have to be redone at frequent intervals. The 
amount of labor involved in this work is considerable. 
Where the pattern is formed by inlaying, the work itself is 
troublesome and very costly. For readily producing patterned shaped articles 
that do not lose their surface patterns and do not become  
 
unsightly even when exposed to surface abrasion, the 
applicant previously proposed methods that use at least one 
member selected from among an auxiliary form matched to the 
pattern to be formed (Japanese Patent Public Disclosurs No. 
4-105903, No. 5-38707, No. 5-38708 and No. 5-238767 and 
European Patent Application No. 91307802), a cell body 
consisting of contiguous columnar subdivisions of equal 
height (Japanese Patent Public Disclosures No. 4-140104, 
No. 4-139083, No. 5-847157, No. 5-84714 and European Patent 
Application No. 91308898) and a bristling body consisting 
of a dense aggregation of upright bristles (Japanese Patent 
Public Disclosures No. 4-345803, No. 5-324068, No. 5-237816 
and No. 5-237821 and European Patent Application No. 
92304366). The applicant also proposed a method of producing 
patterned shaped articles with markedly improved 
productivity comprising the steps of using an auxiliary 
form, a cell body or a bristling body to form a course of a 
first material to a prescribed thickness, removing a part 
of the first material course to form empty regions therein, 
and charging the empty regions with a second material

A molding apparatus for a patterned shaped 
article (M) comprising a retainer (1) having a plurality of 

retaining portions for retaining particles, means (12, 32, 
53, 74, 83, 92, 94, 101) for charging particles (M₁) into 

the retainer, means (14, 5', 34, 55, 75, 84, 93, 8', 102, 
104) for removing the particles from some of the retaining 

portions of the retainer, and means (17, 35, 38, 56, 78, 
86, 92, 94, 103, 106) for charging particles (M₂) of a 

different kind into the retaining portions from which the 
particles were removed, the apparatus producing a patterned 

shaped article by conducting at least one cycle of 
operation in which particles are charged into the retainer, 

the charged particles are removed from some of the 
retaining portions of the retainer and particles of a 

different kind are charged into the retaining portions from 
which the particles were removed, and releasing the 

particles retained by the retainer to form a course of 
prescribed thickness on a base surface. 
A method of producing a patterned shaped 
article using the molding apparatus of claim 1, comprising 

the steps of: 
   charging dry particles into all retaining 

portions of a retainer having a plurality of retaining 
portions; 

   removing the charged particles from some of the 
retaining portions of the retainer; 

   charging particles of a different kind into the 
retaining portions from which the particles were removed;

 
   optionally conducting one or more additional 

cycles of said particle charging, removal and recharging, 
and then releasing the particles retained by the retainer 

to form a course of prescribed thickness on a base surface.
