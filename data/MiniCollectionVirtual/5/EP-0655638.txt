<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lens capable of 
a short distance photographing (close-up) with a 
vibration reduction function, which is used in, e.g., a 
camera, a video camera, or the like and, more 
particularly, to a vibration reduction method for a 
lens capable of a short distance photographing or 
close-up (so-called a micro lens or macro lens). Conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application Nos. 1-189621, 1-191112, and 
1-191113, means for correcting a variation in image 
position caused by, e.g., a camera shake by moving all 
or some of lenses in a lens group in a direction 
substantially perpendicular to the optical axis when 
the photographing distance is infinity or a distance 
close to infinity (in a state having a photographing 
magnification of almost 0) is known. Note that correcting a variation in image position 
caused by, e.g., a camera shake by moving the lens 
group in a direction substantially perpendicular to the 
optical axis will be referred to as "vibration 
reduction" in this specification.  However, in the above-mentioned prior arts, 
vibration reduction cannot be attained in a 
sufficiently large photographing magnification (e.g., 
×-1/2) state, and is impossible to attain when the 
photographing magnification is in an almost one to one 
magnification (×-1) state. Note that no vibration reduction techniques having 
sufficient imaging performance for a lens capable of a 
short distance photographing (close-up) have been 
disclosed in known references (including patent 
publications). The present invention has been made in 
consideration of the above situation, and has as its 
object to provide a lens capable of a short distance 
photographing (close-up), which has a vibration 
reduction function, has a compact structure and high 
performance, and is suitably used for a photograph, 
video image, and the like. A lens capable of a short distance photographing 
(close-up) comprises a plurality of lens groups 
respectively having positive or negative refracting 
powers, at least one lens group interval changes for 
focusing, and the lens satisfies the following 
condition at a minimum photographing distance:

 |βM| > 0.25 


 
   (βM is the photographing 
magnification at a shortest 
photographing distance)
 
Of the plurality of lens groups, at least one lens 
group, which is located at the image side of a lens 
group movable for focusing, is moved in a direction 
substantially perpendicular to the optical axis, 
thereby attaining vibration reduction.
