<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyolefin compositions
comprising a crystalline propylene polymer or copolymer, and
olefin copolymers.It is known that crystalline propylene polymers possess
good characteristics in terms of stiffness, processability in
the molten state, heat resistance and resistance to atmospheric
agents and to solvents. Also known is that their poor impact
resistance (resilience), particularly at low temperatures, can
be improved by adding copolymers of ethylene with α-olefins
(such as propylene or 1-butene). Polyolefin compositions of
this type comprising crystalline polypropylene, optionally
containing ethylene/propylene copolymers and one or more
additional copolymers of ethylene with an α-olefin (such as
propylene or 1-butene), are described in US patent 5,001,182,
and in published European patent applications 496625 and
519725. Said compositions find application above all in the
automotive field (e.g bumpers and side strips).US patent 5,001,182 describes in particular polyolefin
compositions comprising, besides a so called propylene/ethylene
"block copolymer" (made up of a blend of polypropylene and
ethylene/propylene copolymers), an additional low-crystallinity
copolymer of ethylene with an α-olefin, and a filler selected
from talc and calcium carbonate.
The polyolefin compositions described in published European
patent applications 496625 and 519725, besides a propylene 
polymer which can be a block copolymer of the type described
above, comprise also a low-crystallinity ethylene-propylene
rubber (such as EPR or EPDM preferably containing 12 to 30% by
weight of propylene), and a high-crystallinity copolymer of
ethylene with an α-olefin (such as LLDPE or VLDPE). According
to European application 496625, said compositions comprise from
7 to 25 parts by weight of talc per 100 parts by weight of
polymer, while according to European application 519725 talc
is present in quantities ranging from 0 to 7 parts by weight
per 100 parts by weight of polymer.The polyolefin compositions described in published European
patent application EP-A-412 534 consist as main constituents of
crystalline propylene polymers, xylene-soluble ethylene/propylene
random copolymers, partially crystalline ethylene/propylene
copolymers and talc.The above compositions present satisfactory Izod impact
resistance values at low temperatures (-30°/-40°C).However, the examples in US patent 5,001,182 and European
applications 412 534, 496625 and 519725, show that for Izod values at
low temperatures around 7-8 Kg cm/cm
