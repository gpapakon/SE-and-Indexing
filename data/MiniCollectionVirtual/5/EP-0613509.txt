<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
a screen product, and to a screen product manufactured 
according to the method. The invention relates in 
particular to manufacturing a screen or a filter plate or 
a drum by a new machining method by which a product is 
produced the flow properties of which are remarkably better 
than the ones of prior art apparatus. The screen plate or 
cylinder of the invention is especially well applicable in 
the screens, filters, thickeners, washers, etc. used in 
the wood processing industry, but of course it can be 
applied also in sorting and thickening purposes in any 
other industry. There are known several different prior art methods of 
manufacturing the screen products mentioned above. Some 
of the oldest and still used methods are drilling to produce 
round holes, punching to form apertures of the desired 
configuration, and milling to produce narrow slots. US 
patents no. 239,836, no. 1,467,758, and no. 1,928,216 may 
be mentioned as examples of the above methods of 
manufacturing a screen plate. The mechanical machining 
methods mentioned above have for a relatively long time 
been the only applicable methods even though they have 
their drawbacks. Punching is usually out of the question 
when producing screen plates for the wood processing 
industry because the slot size required in the screens is 
so small that punching does not produce it without 
difficulty. Drilling can produce holes which are just 
about small enough. Drilling small holes is effectively 
limited by the tendensy of the drills to break. Therefore, 
when a plate is manufactured by drilling, it is necessary 
either to mill or drill a larger opening in the plate into 
which opening the relatively low apertures produced by 
drilling open. This procedure reduces the tendency of the  
 
drills to break. However, the drawbacks of the increased 
number of work phases and the burrs or fins left in the 
edge of the aperture machined last, which is typical of 
mechanical machining methods, still remain. The fibers of 
the fibre suspension are easily caught by these burrs which 
gradually causes clogging of the screen. It is often very 
difficult to remove the burrs because they in most cases 
are located at the bottom of very narrow grooves or 
apertures the diameter of which is very small. The same problems are met with also in screen products made 
by milling where the burrs remain at the bottom of the 
so-called back grooves. Because of the strength 
requirements of the product
