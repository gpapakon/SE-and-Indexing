<ABSTRACT>
Machine for continuously packaging food products in a 
net comprising a frame (1) which supports a net spreading 

element (8a). A cutting unit (4) is located peripherally 
with respect to the spreading element (8a) and is movable 

between a position which substantially flanks the spreading 
element (8a) and a forward-shifted position. A clamp unit 

(5) is provided with clamps suitable to clamp the net 
against a cylindrical element. The unit is movable between a 

position in which the cylindrical element flanks the 
spreading element (8a) and a position in which it is spaced 

from the spreading element (8a) by a distance which is 
slightly greater than the longitudinal dimension of the 

product to be packaged. A conveyor belt (7) extends from a 
position in which it is in contact with the spreading 

element (8a) to a position in which it is spaced from the 
spreading element (8a) by a distance at least equal to the 

maximum spacing of the clamp unit. There are also a second 
conveyor belt (32) for removing the packaged product and 

means (5c,17b,27,28) for automatic actuation and control of 
all the moving elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for 
continuously packaging food products in a net. The existence of devices for packaging food products, 
such as for example roast chicken or pork, in a net is 
known; said devices comprise a tubular element on which the 
net is peripherally loaded, whereas the product to be 
packaged in the net is inserted inside said element in order 
to make it protrude from one end by manual actuation or by 
means of a pusher, so that it makes contact with the net. This method is obviously rather slow, most of all 
because it is often necessary to interrupt operation to 
peripherally supply the tubular net element, and therefore 
the aim of the present invention is to provide a machine for 
continuously packaging food products in a net which is 
highly productive. This aim is achieved by a machine for continuously 
packaging food products in a net, according to the present 
invention, characterized in that it comprises, aligned 
consecutively on a frame: 
-- a hemispherical net spreading element being provided 
with wings and supported by said frame in a fixed position; -- a cutting unit located peripherally with respect to 
the spreading element, comprising blades suitable to cut the 
net, and provided with means for translatory motion along 
longitudinal guides supported by said frame, between a 
position which substantially flanks the hemispherical part 
of the spreading element and a position in which the blades 
operate in a plane which is shifted forward with respect to 
the end of the wings of said spreading element;  -- a clamp unit provided with clamps suitable to clamp 
the net against a hollow cylindrical element rigidly coupled 
to said unit, and provided with means for translatory motion 
along longitudinal guides supported by the frame, between a 
position in which said hollow cylindrical element is 
inserted within the wings of the spreading element, so that 
the clamps face the interspaces present between said wings, 
and a position in which said hollow cylindrical element is 
spaced from said spreading element by a distance which is 
slightly greater than the longitudinal dimension of the 
product to be packaged in a net; -- a conveyor belt arranged so that its upper portion 
for conveying the product to be packaged in a net is 
arranged longitudinally, and suitable to move, with its end 
directed toward the net spreading element, from a position 
in which it is in contact with said spreading element to a 
position in which it is spaced from the spreading
