<ABSTRACT>
For measuring the concentration of a substance in body fluid, such as the glucose level in blood or tissue, a strip electrode (18) and a ring electrode (19) are arranged at the specimen. The ring electrode (19) is in direct electrical contact with the specimen while the strip electrode (18) is electrically insulated therefrom. The strip electrode (18) is arranged parallel to an arm or a leg for obtaining a large interaction length. The electrodes (18, 19) form a capacitor in a resonant circuit. A modulated voltage in the MHz range close to or at the resonance frequency is applied to the electrodes and the response of the body fluid is measured. This design allows a measurement of high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for determining the concentration of glucose in an in-vitro or in-vivo specimen containing body liquid according to the preamble of the independent claims.Radio wave spectroscopy has been known to provide promising potential in the in-vitro and in-vivo determination of the concentration of glucose and other substances in body fluids. In particular, this technology is of substantial interest for the determination of glucose concentration in blood and/or inter- or intracellular liquid. A device for measuring blood level glucose is disclosed in US 5 792 668, where two electrodes are brought into direct contact with the human body and the impedance is measured between them.Despite its potential, the technology has not yet been used in commercial devices, which is attributed to the limited accuracy of the presently known solutions.Hence, it is the goal of the invention to provide a device that allows to increase the reliability of this type of measurement.This goal is reached by claim 1.Accordingly, the first electrode is electrically insulated from the specimen. Hence, the measured parameter does not depend on the surface conditions of the specimen. Rather, the signal is capacitively coupled to the specimen and the measured parameter depends therefore primarily on the conditions within the specimen. The parameter measured in this way can then be converted to the desired concentration, e.g. by using calibration data.In addition, the first electrode is arranged on an insulating substrate between the substrate and the insulating cover layer. Hence, the substrate can provide mechanical stability to the electrode while the cover layer can be thin, which allows the electrode to be placed close to the specimen.Preferably, at least two electrodes are provided, wherein the modulated voltage is applied between them. By using two electrodes, a defined field can be established within the specimen. For best signals, it has been found advantageous to place the second electrode in electric contact with the specimen.The measured parameter preferably depends on the electrical impedance at the electrode(s). It has been found that the concentration of various substances, in particular glucose, affects the real or imaginary part of this impedance because it changes the loss and/or dielectric constant of body fluid.Preferably, the electrode forms part of a resonant circuit, which is operated at or close to its resonance frequency. Under such conditions, a change of the dielectric or loss
