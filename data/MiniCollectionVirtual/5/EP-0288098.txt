<ABSTRACT>
The gun has a delivery opening (4) with a nozzle (7) which 
can be opened and closed for the delivery of the liquid to be 

sprayed. A diffusing member (21) is associated with the opening 
(4) downstream from the nozzle (7) so as to vary the 

conformation of the jet of the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a spray gun with adjustment of the 
shape of the jet. As is well known, spray guns are constituted by a delivery 
pipe connected to a hollow handgrip through which the liquid to 
be sprayed passes. The delivery pipe terminates at its front end with a spray 
opening with a nozzle at its centre through which the liquid is 
delivered. Inside the delivery pipe there is a movable member for 
closing and opening the nozzle, said member being operated from 
the outside by means of appropriate control levers. The adjustment of the flow of the liquid is obtained by 
operating the member for opening and closing the nozzle, namely, 
when the nozzle is open the delivered spray jet will have a 
limited diameter and range but with larger droplets while when 
the nozzle is partially closed the delivered spray jet will 
have a larger diameter and range but with finely dispersed 
droplets. The spray jet issuing from the nozzle has a circular shape 
and tends to concentrate on a larger or a smaller circular area 
in relation to the nozzle opening and to the distance between 
the surface to be sprayed and the gun. With this type of spray gun, for example as disclosed in US-A-4448355, it is not, however, possible to  
 
deliver flat-shaped spray jets with which it is possible to 
cover an area larger than with a circular spray jet. It is also known from US-A-4 380 319 to provide a liquid spray 
apparatus with an adjustable diffusing member which is used to vary the 
conformation of the jet of the liquid, the diffusing member is arranged down 
stream from the nozzle. Given this state of the art, the object of the present 
invention is to realize a spray gun which can vary the shape of 
the delivered spray jet, in particular so that it is possible 
to transform the spray jet, in adjustable way it as required, 
from a circular shape to a fan shape. According to the invention, such object is attained by a 
spray gun which includes a delivery pipe connected to a hollow 
handgrip through which the liquid to be sprayed arrives, said 
pipe terminating at its front end with an opening provided with 
a nozzle which can be opened or closed for the delivery of the 
liquid contained in said pipe, characterized in that said 
opening includes an adjustable diffusing member arranged 
downstream from the nozzle in order to vary the conformation of 
the liquid jet issuing from said nozzle, 
said diffusing member comprising two flat and 
parallel tangs or feathers, which can be moved closer or 
farther apart from one
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1. Spray gun including a delivery pipe (2) connected to a 
hollow hand grip (1) through which the liquid to be sprayed 

passes, said delivery pipe (2) having at the front an opening 
(4) provided with a nozzle (7) which can be opened and closed 

for the delivery of the liquid contained in the delivery pipe 
(2), characterized in that said opening (4) includes an 

adjustable diffusing member (21) arranged downstream from the 
nozzle (7) so as to vary the shape of the liquid jet issuing 

from said nozzle (7),
 
said 

diffusing member (21) including two flat and parallel tangs (23) 
which can be moved closer and farther away from one another by 

means of a sleeve collar (20) with a casing (32) which engages 
the outside of said tangs (23). 
2. Spray gun according to claim 1 characterized in that said 
tangs (23) have a tip (26) which extends towards the outlet of 

said opening (4) and the rear extremity is fastened to the 
outlet of said delivery pipe (2), said tangs (23) having also 

lateral protrusions (24) from which the tapered teeth (25) 
extend towards the tips of the tangs themselves and said sleeve 

collar (20) can rotate on said diffusing member (21) and has two 
separate spiral arc seats (27) inside it which can receive the 

tapered teeth (25) of said diffusing member (21), said seats 
(27) having external and internal side walls (28) and (29) and  

 
a bottom (31) in which the external side walls (28) are defined 

by the casing (32) of the sleeve collar (20) and the internal 
side walls (29) are defined by a flanged opening (33) contained 

within said sleeve collar (20), the flange (34) of said opening 
(33) being connected to the casing (32) of said sleeve collar 

(20) and constituting the bottom (31) of said seats (27), said 
opening defining a passage (35) for the tangs (23) of the 

diffusing member (21). 
3. Spray gun according to claim 2 characterized in that each 
spiral arc seat (27) has two extremities (43 and 44) of which a 

first extremity (43) is at a radial distance from the 
longitudinal axis of the passage (35) which is greater than the 

distance existing between said axis and the second extremity 
(44), said first extremities (43), in the same way as said 

second extremities (44), being arranged in a diametrically 
opposite position. 
4. Spray gun according to claim 3 or 4 characterized in 
that the clamping sleeve collar (20) has a frontal portion (40) 

with a flared internal wall, whose extremities have opposite 
radial notches (41).
