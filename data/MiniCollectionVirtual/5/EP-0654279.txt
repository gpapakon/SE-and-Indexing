<ABSTRACT>
A computer-controlled injector (40) of the type 
having a motor which advances and retracts a plunger (12) 

located within a syringe housing (10) toward and away 
from a nozzle located in the front of the syringe to 

inject fluid into or out of an animal subject. Manual 
motion is induced by operating a manual motion control 

(44-48); the operator can manipulate the control to 
indicate the desired direction and velocity of motion. 

The manual motion control also has a locking mode in 
which manual motion of the plunger will continue once 

initiated without requiring the operator to continue 
manipulating the manual motion control. The injector 

performs injections in accordance with one of several 
pre-programmed protocols, and automatically tracks the 

fluid volume remaining. The injector compensates for 
plunger extenders found in some partially pre-filled 

syringes by applying a stored offset value to the 
computed plunger position.

<DESCRIPTION>
Injectors are devices that expel fluid, such as 
radiopaque media (contrast fluid) used to enhance x-ray 
or magnetic images, from a syringe, through a tube, and 
into an animal subject. Injectors are typically provided 
with an injector unit, adjustably fixed to a stand or 
support, having a plunger drive that couples to the 
plunger of the syringe and may move the plunger forward 
to expel fluid into the tube, or move the plunger 
rearward to draw fluid into the syringe to fill it. Injectors often include control circuits for 
controlling the plunger drive so as to control the rate 
of injection and amount of fluid injected into the 
subject. Typically, the control circuit includes one or 
more manual switches which allow a user to manually 
actuate the plunger drive to move the plunger into or out 
of the syringe; typically the user holds down a "forward" 
or "reverse" drive switch to move the plunger in the 
indicated direction. To reduce the risk of infection, in a typical 
injection procedure the syringe is only used once, and is  
 
disposed after use. In some cases, the syringe is 
inserted into the injector empty. The empty syringe is 
filled by retraction of the plunger while the interior of 
the syringe communicates with a supply of the contrast 
fluid via an injection tube connected between the nozzle 
of the syringe and the supply of media. Then, bubbles 
are removed from the syringe, and the injection is 
performed. At the end of the procedure, the syringe 
plunger typically is forward, as is the plunger drive. In some injectors, the syringe can only be removed 
or replaced while the plunger drive is fully retracted. 
As illustrated in Fig. 1A, typically an empty syringe 10 
is filled with sterile air, with the plunger 12 at the 
fully retracted position as shown. The plunger drive 
includes a jaw 18 designed to engage and disengage a 
button 14 on the rear side of the plunger while the 
plunger is in this fully-retracted position. Before an 
empty new syringe can be filled, it is necessary that the 
plunger be moved fully forward in the syringe so that the 
syringe can be filled by rearward retraction of the 
plunger. Thus, the reloading operation can involve fully 
retracting the plunger drive to allow removal and 
replacement of the syringe, then fully advancing the 
plunger drive and plunger to expel air from the syringe, 
and then retracting the plunger drive and plunger to fill 
the syringe. These lengthy, manual movements of the 
plunger and drive are time consuming. A co-pending
