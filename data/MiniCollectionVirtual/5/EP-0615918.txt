<ABSTRACT>
A cap (10) for screwing on the neck (18) of a container (20) is provided with a stopper (34) placed inside the cap (10). When the cap (10) equipped with the stopper (34) is screwed on the neck (18) of the container (20) for the first time, the stopper (34) is forced into the neck (18) in order to close it hermetically. The stopper (34) remains in the neck (18) if the cap (10) is removed. In an inverted position, the cap (10) serves for perforating the stopper (34).

Means for hermetic closure of a container, 
comprising a cap adapted to be applied onto the neck of a 

container and having a cylindrical skirt extending from one 
of the sides of an end wall of the cap, the other side of 

the end wall of the cap being provided with a means for 
perforating and cutting out a hermetic sealing means 

applied onto the neck of the container, and a 
circumferential rim extending from the other side of the 

end wall radially outwardly of the perforating and cutting 
means, the cap being adapted to be placed in reversed 

position onto the neck of the container with the 
circumferential rim being received about the mouth of the 

neck for perforating and cutting out the hermetic sealing 
means, characterized in that the hermetic sealing means 

comprises a plug which is preinstalled in the interior of 
the cap and retained by friction therein prior to 

application of the cap with the preinstalled plug onto the 
neck of the container, said plug having an end wall and a 

radial flange adapted to be received on the end of the neck 
of the container, the outer diameter of said radial flange 

being selected so that it can be received in the interior 
of the circumferential rim in the reversed position of the 

cap, the plug being furthermore provided with a cylindrical 
skirt extending from the end wall and adapted to be pressed 

into the neck of the container when the cap with the 
preinstalled plug is applied onto the neck of the container 

in order to retain the plug by friction within the neck of 
the container when the cap is removed, the radial distance 

between the axis of the cap and the outer end of the means 
for perforating and cutting the plug or the hermetic 

sealing element being substantially equal to or inferior to 
the radius of the internal cylindrical wall of the skirt of 

the plug.  
 
Closure means according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the end wall of the plug is provided 

with a weakening of its thickness to facilitate perforation 
and cutting out of the plug to open the container. 
Closure means according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the weakening is an annular weakening 

extending circumferentially and located radially at the 
interior of the inner diameter of the skirt of the plug. 
Closure means according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the weakening also comprises a 

central weakening located at the center of the end wall of 
the plug and a plurality of weakening zones extending 

radially between the annular weakening and the central 
weakening. 
Closure means according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the weakening of the end wall 

comprises the entire surface of the end wall disposed 
radially at the interior of the skirt of the plug with the 

exception of a plurality of isolated zones spaced angularly 
about the axis of the plug. 
Closure means according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the free end of the skirt is provided 

at the exterior with a tapered surface whose small diameter 
is inferior to the diameter of the skirt in proximity of 

the end wall of the plug. 
Closure means according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the radial flange of the plug has a 

plurality of radial projections spaced circumferentially 
about the external diameter of the radial flange and 

frictionally engaging a centering surface of the cap. 
Closure means according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the end wall of the plug is received 

in a flat cutout of the end wall of the cap, delimited 
radially by a centering surface.
