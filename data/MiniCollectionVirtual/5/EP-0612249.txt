<ABSTRACT>
Polyionic derivatives of cyclodextrins and methods for preparing these derivatives are provided in which a polyionic derivative of cyclodextrin is combined with a growth factor, preferably a heparin binding growth factor. These compositions are of low solubility and are applied directly to the location of a wound. By virtue of the low solubility, the compositions remain in place at the site of application and slowly release growth factor. In an alternative embodiment, the cyclodextrin derivatives are administered in the absence of growth factor and are used to absorb growth factor present in the body at the location of the wound in order to prevent overstimulation of the wound response.

This is also a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 480,407, filed February 15, 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference.0 Field of InventionThe present invention is directed to compounds, compositions and methods for healing wounded living tissue, an particularly to saccharide-based compounds and compositions which remain localized at the site of a wound for extended 5 periods of time. 

 Background of the Invention The injury of tissue initiates a series of events tha result in tissue repair and healing of the wound. During the first several days following an injury, there is directed migration of neutrophils, acrophages and fibroblasts to the site of the wound. The macrophages and fibroblasts which migrate to the wound site are activated, thereby resulting in endogenous growth factor production, synthesis of a provisional extracellular matrix, proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. Finally from about two weeks to one year after infliction of the wound there is remodeling of the wound with active collagen turn over and cross linking (Pierce et al., 1991, J. Cell Biochem., 45:319-326). The manner in which this repair process is regulated is mostly unknown; it is known, however, that cell proliferation, migration and protein synthesis can be stimulated by growth factors that act on cells having receptors for these growth factors.In vivo studies have shown that local application of exogenous single growth factors or a combination of growth factors can enhance the healing process following experimental wounding in animals (Antoniades et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:565-569). The ability of these growth factors to promote wound healing has resulted in efforts to obtain these factors
