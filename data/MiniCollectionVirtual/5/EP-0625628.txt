<ABSTRACT>
A novel form of drill bit is disclosed. The bit (30) comprises a bit body 
having a leading face (32) and gauge surface (44, 46). Cutting inserts 

(32, 34, 36) are set into the bit body, each cutting insert being in the 
form of a segment of a composite PCD (polycrystalline diamond) or 

PCBN (polycrystalline cubic boron nitride) composite. Thus each insert 
has a PCD or PCBN compact (40) carried by a carbide backing (42). 

The PCD or PCBN compact of each insert is exposed at the leading face 
or at the gauge surface to perform an axial cutting or gauge maintenance 

function during drilling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drill bits, including coring bits used to extract 
sample cores from the earth, and non-coring bits used to drill holes into 
the earth. A known coring bit has a tubular steel body with a leading end adapted 
to perform a cutting operation and a trailing end adapted to be 
connected to the leading end of a tubular drill string. The leading edge 
of the bit typically carries abrasive particles. Commonly used non-coring 
bits usually have abrasive buttons or cutting inserts set into their leading 
or working face. An object of the present invention is to provide novel forms of drill bit 
for coring applications.  
 EP-A-0 506 238 discloses a drill bit in accordance 
with the preamble of claim 1. According to the present invention there is provided 
a coring drill bit comprising a tubular bit body having a 
leading face, an inner gauge surface and an outer gauge 
surface, and a series of cutting inserts set into the bit 
body, the cutting inserts being in the form of segments 
which are cut from slices of composite PCD or PCBN compacts 
which are of flat proportions, characterised in that each 
cutting insert includes a PCD or PCBN compact carried by a 
carbide backing which is set into the bit body, some of the 
cutting inserts being arranged with their PCD or PCBN 
compacts exposed at the leading face of the bit and 
extending in a radial direction across the leading face 
from the inner gauge surface to the outer gauge surface, 
some of the cutting inserts being arranged with their PCD 
or PCBN compacts exposed at the inner gauge surface and 
extending axially along the inner gauge surface, and some 
of the cutting inserts being arranged with their PCD 
compacts exposed at the outer gauge surface and extending 
axially along the outer gauge surface.  
 In one embodiment, the cutting inserts may be identical but arranged at 
different orientations to provide for exposure of PCD or PCBN 
compacts at the leading face and inner and outer gauge surfaces. The 
cutting inserts may be arranged singly or in clusters of three inserts each. 
In the latter case, the three cutting inserts in each cluster are arranged 
for their PCD or PCBN compacts to be exposed at the leading face and 
inner and outer gauge surfaces respectively.  
 The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example 
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1illustrates diagrammatically how a blank is sliced 
up in the production of the cutting inserts used in 
the drill bit of

<CLAIMS>
A coring drill bit comprising a tubular bit body (30) having a leading face 
(32), an inner gauge surface (44) and an outer gauge surface (46), and a 

series of cutting inserts (54, 56, 58) set into the bit body, the cutting inserts 
being in the form of segments which are cut from slices (18) of composite 

PCD or PCBN compacts (10) which are of flat proportions, characterised in 
that each cutting insert includes a PCD or PCBN compact (40) carried by a 

carbide backing (42) which is set into the bit body, some of the cutting 
inserts (54) being arranged with their PCD or PCBN compacts exposed at 

the leading face of the bit and extending in a radial direction across the 
leading face from the inner gauge surface to the outer gauge surface, some 

of the cutting inserts (56) being arranged with their PCD or PCBN compacts 
exposed at the inner gauge surface and extending axially along the inner 

gauge surface, and some of the cutting inserts (58) being arranged with their 
PCD compacts exposed at the outer gauge surface and extending axially 

along the outer gauge surface. 
A coring drill bit according to claim 1 characterised in that the cutting 
inserts are arranged in clusters (50) of three inserts each, the cutting inserts 

in each cluster being similar to one another but arranged at different 
orientations so as to be exposed at the leading face, at the inner gauge 

surface and at the outer gauge surface respectively.
