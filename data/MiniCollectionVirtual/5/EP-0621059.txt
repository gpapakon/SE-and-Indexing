<ABSTRACT>
A coated golf ball comprising a core, a cover 
layer covering said core and a white paint layer 

coated on said cover wherein said cover is mainly 
composed of trans-polyisoprene, said paint layer 

comprising one or more white coating layers and clear 
coating layers, the white paint for forming said white 

paint layer comprising 20 to 70% by weight of a white 
pigment and 0.005 to 0.10% by weight of a blue pigment 

based on the solid content of the white paint, wherein 
said blue pigment is selected from ε-phthalocyanine 

blue or indanthrone blue or a mixture of two or more 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball having a
surface coated with a paint, i.e. a coated golf ball. More
particularly, it relates to a coated golf ball having a stabilized
color tone and improved weathering properties.A golf ball covered with a balata cover remains
popular because of its superior performance. The golf baLl with
a balata cover has poor whiteness in comparison with a golf ball
covered with an ionomer resin cover, because the balata cover
itself has dark and dull color and even if coated with a white
paint, its whiteness is insufficient.In order to improve the whiteness of a golf ball with a
balata cover. Japanese Kokai Publication Hei 4(1992)-500295
suggests formulating suitable amounts of blue and violet
pigments in white paint. However, when two kinds of coloring
pigments are formulated, it is necessary to control the amount
of each pigment delicately. When the amount of one pigment
becomes larger than that of the other one, the color tone of the
resulting golf ball varies greatly, which results in variability of
products. Furthermore, since two kinds of pigments are formulated,
it takes a lot of time to disperse each pigment during a mixing
process. Also, there is a problem that the balata cover is
discolored due to weathering discoloration of the cover and
paint. Under these circumstances, the present inventors
have intensively studied in order to solve the above
problem on the formulation of two kinds of pigments.
As a result, the present invention has been completed.
The main object of the present invention is to provide
a coated golf ball having stabilized colour tone and
improved weathering properties.This object as well as other objects and
advantages of the present invention will become
apparent to those skilled in the art from the
following description. That is, the present invention
provides a coated golf ball comprising a core, a cover
layer covering said core and a white paint layer
coated on the cover layer, wherein said cover layer is
mainly composed of transpolyisoprene, said paint layer
comprising one or more white coating layers and clear
coating layers, characterised in that the white paint
for forming the white paint layer comprises in the
range of 20 to 70% by weight of a white pigment and,
as sole coloured pigment, from 0.005 to 0.10% by
weight of a blue pigment based on the solids content
of the white paint, wherein the blue pigment is ε-phthalocyanine
blue, indanthrone blue or a mixture
thereof.The present invention provides the improvement of
a golf ball
