<DESCRIPTION>
 PREVENTION OF HEMOLYSISFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention is concerned broadly with the prevention of damage to blood cells, particularly, erythrocytes. More specifically, the present invention is directed to the use of anionic gligosaccharides to prevent undesired hemolysis of blood cells, in the presence or absence of hemolytically active pharmacological agents. The present invention is also directed to novel non-hemolytic compositions, blood storage compositions and blood products comprising such anionic oligosaccharides.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHemolysis, damage to the structure of erythrocytes(red blood cells) resulting in a . loss of hemoglobin, is generally undesired. Hemolysis can occur in vivo as the result of certain disease states or upon administration of certain therapeutic agents. In vitro, hemolysis can be induced during the handling and storage of blood, blood components or solutions, tissues or organs containing erythrocytes. Various chemical or pharmaceutical agents, as well as materials such as silica, clay, asbestos etc. can each cause hemolysis upon contact with erythrocytes. Because of their hemolytic properties, the use of many compounds and pharmaceutical agents that may have desirable pharmacologic properties may be limited in dosage or prevented from use altogether. For example, phenothiazine compounds are known to induce hemolysis above concentrations of the order of 0.1 M. Chlorpromazine, a neuroleptic compound of the phenothiazine family exhibits hemolytic properties at concentrations in excess of 0.5 mM. 

 Therefore the pharmaceutical use of chlorpromazine is restricted in dosage to avoid hemolytic side affects which would result at higher concentrations.It has been previously reported that simultaneous use of 1.0 mM ?-cyclodextrin inhibits the hemolytic action of chloropromazine. (K. Uekama et al., Protective Effects of Cyclodextrins on Drug-Induced Hemolysis In Vitro, Effects of Cyclodextrins on Chlorpromazine Induced Hemolysis and Central Nervous System Responses, J. Phar . Pharmacol., 33:707-710 (1981)) . It was shown that protection from hemolytic effects of the drug can be obtained by virtue of the ability of cyclodextrin to include the offending molecules within the cavity of the cyclic, doughnut shaped cyclodextrin molecule. This internal complexing capability of cyclodextrins has been widely recognized (see for example W. Saenger, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 19. 344-362 1980) and has been applied for the delivery of thereby solubilized pharmaceutical compounds
