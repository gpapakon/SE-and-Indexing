<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the area of organic
compounds with antiviral activity, and
the use of said compounds in
the treatment of viral diseases
that includes administering an effective amount of
one or more of the described compounds.A number of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides have been
found to be potent antiviral agents against human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AZT
(3'-azido-2'-deoxythymidine, Mitsuya, H.; Broder,
S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1986 83, 1911)
was the first compound approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of
patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. Other
synthetic nucleosides have now either been approved
or are undergoing various stages of clinical
trials, including 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI),
2',3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC) (see Yarchoan, R. et.
al., Science, 1989, 245, 412), and 2'-fluoro-arabinofuranosyl-2'-3'-dideoxycytidine
(Martin,
T.A., et al., J. Med. Chem., 1990, 33, 2137;
Watanabe, K.A., et al., J. Med. Chem., 1990, 33,
2145; Sterzycki, R.Z., et al., J. Med. Chem., 1990
33, 2150).After cellular phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate
by cellular kinases, these synthetic
nucleosides may be incorporated into a growing 
strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due
to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group.The stereochemistry of nucleoside derivatives
play an important role in their biological
activity. The C1' position of the ribose in the
nucleoside (the carbon bound to the nitrogen of the
heterocyclic base) is a chiral center because the
carbon is attached to four different moieties.
Likewise, there is an optically active center at
C4' of the nucleoside (the ring carbon bound to the
hydroxymethyl group that is phosphorylated in
nucleotides). In the naturally occurring
nucleosides, the base attached to the C1' and
the hydroxymethyl group attached to the C4' atom
are in the β-configuration (above the plane of the
sugar). The corresponding non-naturally occurring
α-isomers (in which the moieties are below the
plane of the sugar) are rarely biologically active,
and are typically toxic.An analysis of the solid-state conformations
of six active and two inactive anti-HIV nucleoside
agents was recently performed to attempt to
correlate the presence or absence of certain
stereochemical features with high HIV activity.
