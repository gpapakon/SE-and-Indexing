<ABSTRACT>
A microkeratome and related surgical methods for performing lamellar keratotomies are provided. The microkeratome includes a guide ring assembly for placement on the eyeball, or ocular globe such that the globe's cornea protrudes therethrough. Means are provided for temporarily fixing the guide ring to the ocular globe, immobilizing the eyeball relative to the instrument. A cutting blade suitable for corneal resections is carried in a cutting head over the guide ring through a cutting path defined by the guide ring. An adjustable float head, also generally known as a plaque, is connected to the cutting head for at least partially compressing the cornea ahead of the blade, so as to set the desired thickness of the corneal resection. Means are further provided for driving the cutting head and float heat across the guide ring, whereby the blade cuts at least partially through the cornea to perform the lamellar keratotomy. Various surgical corrections are obtainable through the use of arcuate and oblique plaques, as an alternative to planar plaques or float heads, where appropriate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical instruments
and methods for performing eye surgery to correct
irregularities of the cornea. More particularly, the
present invention relates to mechanical instruments known
as microkeratomes, and related surgical methods for
performing lamellar keratotomies.The first microkeratome for performing corneal
resections was developed in 1962 by one of the present
inventors, Doctor Jose I. Barraquer, and is shown generally
in FIG. 1A. This microkeratome includes a guide ring which
is fixed to an ocular globe, or eyeball, with the aid of a
partial vacuum applied through the ring. The guide ring
immobilizes the ocular globe, maintains the tension of the
globe, and regulates the diameter of the corneal resection.
A portion of the microkeratome called a cutting head is
supported within a channel in the guide ring for guided
linear movement of the microkeratome across the ring by the
surgeon. The cutting head carries a cutting blade that is
oscillated by a motor-driven eccentric transverse the
channel as the instrument is moved through the cutting path
defined by the channel. The cutting head carries a
removable, lover planar member that compresses the ocular
globe ahead of the oscillating blade, to permit the blade
to cut a lamella having a lower surface that is parallel to
the surface of the cornea that is compressed by the planar
member. The planar member is interchangeable with similar
planar members of differing thicknesses, so as to vary the
thickness of the resectioned corneal "disk." Numerous variations on the Barraquer microkeratome
have been made since 1962, including the apparatus that is
the subject of U.S. Patent No. 4,662,370 assigned to Carl-Zeiss-stiftung
of Germany. The '370 patent describes a
microkeratome having interchangeable inserts with convex,
concave, and planar surfaces that engage and compress the
cornea for producing a corneal resection of predetermined
form and curvature. The inserts are set within a
stationary planar member that is fixed to the guide ring.
The cutting blade is moved through a cutting path parallel
to the planar member defined by a gap between the planar
member and the guide ring, and oscillates transverse the
path.While apparently effective to permit resections of
corneal lenticula, the apparatus of the '370 patent lacks
means for controlling, or automating the rate of movement
by the cutting head across the guide ring, and is therefore
prone to binding up in the corneal tissue, or otherwise
producing imprecise resections under
