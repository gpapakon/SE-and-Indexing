<ABSTRACT>
A fluid operated tool (1) for tightening and loosening an element (21) has a unit (8, 13) for clamping an element (21) to be tightened or loosened, a unit (9) for turning the element clamped by the clamping unit (8, 13), and a fluid operated drive unit (2, 3) formed to act on the clamping unit (8, 13) and on the turning unit (9) so that under the action of the fluid operated drive unit (2, 3) the clamping unit (8, 13) clamps the element (21) and then the turning unit (9) turns the clamped element (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid operated tool, of
the kind described in the preamble of claim 1, for tightening and loosening an element.Fluid operated tools are used for many purposes,
including tightening and loosening various elements, such as
for example, threaded connectors. For tightening or
loosening an element it is necessary first to firmly engage
it and then to apply a turning force so as to turn the
element. In some instances the engagement is quite
complicated, and it is necessary to reliably clamp the
element first and then to turn it. It is therefore
desirable to provide a tool which can perform reliable
clamping of the element and then its turning as desired. An
example of such a known fluid operated tool is described in US-A-4,308,767.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a fluid operated tool, which is formed to actively
clamp an element and then to turn it for tightening or
loosening.According to the present invention there is provided
a fluid operated tool for tightening and loosening an element,
the tool being as claimed in the ensuing claim 1. FIG. 1 is a front view of a fluid operated tool in
accordance with the present invention;FIG. 2 is a side view of the fluid operated
tool in accordance with the present invention;FIG. 3 is a plan view of the fluid operated
tool in accordance with the present invention.A fluid operated tool in accordance with the present
invention is identified as a whole with reference numeral 1.
The tool has a fluid operated drive which includes a first
cylinder-piston unit 2 and a second cylinder-piston unit 3.
A piston 4 moves in a cylinder 5 of the first cylinder-piston
unit 2 while a piston 6 moves in the cylinder 7 of
the second cylinder-piston unit 3. The cylinders can be
formed directly in the housing 1. The piston 4 of the first cylinder-piston unit 2 is
provided with a clamping part 8 at its free end. The
clamping part 8 can be formed by a plurality of teeth or
other engaging formations formed directly on the surface
of the free end of the piston 4. On the other hand, the
clamping part 8 can be formed as a separate member provided
with such teeth or formations and attached to the free end
of the piston 4. The tool further has arm means 9 composed of
two arm members 9' located at opposite sides of the central
longitudinal plane A of the tool. One end of the arm means 9 is
pivotally connected with a free end of the piston 6 of the
second cylinder-piston unit 3, for example by a pin 10. The
pin 10 extends through an opening in the

<CLAIMS>
A fluid operated tool for tightening and
loosening an element (21), comprising a first assembly

including a fluid-operated first cylinder-piston unit (2)
having a first cylinder (5) and a first piston (4) movable

in the first cylinder (5), a second assembly turnable
relative to the first assembly about a turning axis and

comprising arm means (9) having first and second ends,
clamping means for clamping an element (21) to be tightened

or loosened and including a first clamping part (8) and a
second clamping part (13) turnably journalled in said arm

means (9) at said first end, and turning means for turning
the first and second assemblies relative to each other about

said turning axis and comprising a second cylinder-piston
unit (3) having a second cylinder (7) and a second piston

(6) movable in the second cylinder (7) and connected to said
second end of the arm means (9), characterised in that the

second cylinder (7) is connected to the first assembly, in
that the second clamping part (13) is journalled in said arm

means at said one end for turning about said turning axis,
and in that the first clamping part (8) is connected to or

forms part of the first piston (4) and is movable by the
latter towards and away from the second clamping part to

clamp or unclamp an element (21), whereby on actuation of
the second cylinder-piston unit (3), when an element (21) is

clamped by the clamping means and the second end of the arm
means reacts against a neighbouring object, the first and

second clamping parts (8, 13) and the clamped element (21)
are turned together relative to the arm (9) about said

turning axis to tighten or loosen the clamped element.
A fluid operated tool according to claim 1,
characterised in that the tool further comprises means

allowing a flow of said fluid from said first cylinder (5)
to said second cylinder (7) only when a pressure of the

working fluid reaches a predetermined level after clamping
of the element (21) so that the latter is turned after it

has been clamped. 
A fluid operated tool according to claim 1,
characterised in that it further comprises means (14-16) for

communicating said fluid operated cylinder-piston units
(2,3) with a source of working fluid and with one another so

that the working fluid is first supplied into said first
fluid operated cylinder-piston unit (2) to act on said first

piston (4) for moving the first clamping part (8) towards
the second clamping part (13) to clamp the element (21),

and is then supplied to said second fluid operated cylinder-piston
unit (3) so-as subsequently to act on said second

piston (6) for subsequently turning the clamped element
(21).
A fluid operated tool according to claim 1,
characterised in that said communicating means (14-16)

includes a first passage (14) leading from a source of the
working fluid to said first cylinder-piston unit (2), a

second passage (16) communicating said fluid operated
cylinder-piston units (2,3) with one another, and in that a

valve (18) is arranged in said second passage (16) and is
formed so as to open only when a pressure of the working

fluid reaches a predetermined level after clamping of the
element (21).
