<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an EEPROM memory cell having two
levels of polysilicon.In particular, the invention concerns a two-level
polysilicon EEPROM memory cell of a type which comprises a
floating gate transistor connected serially to a selection
transistor and provided with a further control gate
overlying the floating gate, an intermediate dielectric
layer being interposed between the gates.The invention further concerns a manufacturing process for
such memory cells.As is well known, EEPROM memory structures, while being of
the non-volatile type, allow the information stored therein
to be altered electrically both during the write and the
erase phases.In essence, EEPROMs can have the state of any memory cells
altered by tunnelling electrons through a thin layer of
silicon oxide.The thin oxide region has a smaller area than the so-called
floating gate whereinto the electric charge is stored.Memory cells with the above-outlined construction are
referred to as FLOTOX, and are described, for example, in
an article entitled "Oxide reliability criterion for the
evaluation of endurance performance of electrically
erasable programmable read-only memories", Journal App.
Phys. 71, No. 9, 1992. This kind of EEPROM memories falls into two general
classes: a first class provided with a single level of
polysilicon, and a second class having two distinct levels
of polysilicon.Memories of the first class have an advantage in that they
can be manufactured by a comparatively simple process; but
the overall circuit space requirements are much higher,
usually by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5.This penalizes memories with a single level of polysilicon
in all those applications which require high circuit
density, e.g. in excess of one Megabit.It should be noted here that memories of either classes,
whether with one or two levels of polysilicon, use positive
voltages for both writing and erasing purposes. These
voltages range from 8 to 12 Volts in order to generate a
sufficiently strong electric field across the thin oxide to
effectively trigger the tunnel effect.However, the use of these relatively high positive voltages
may eventually result in the thin oxide layer becoming
deteriorated.A first prior art solution to realize a two-level
polysilicon EEPROM memory cell is disclosed in the U.S.
patent No. US-A-5,081,054 which discloses a floating gate
transistor connected serially to a selection transistor and
provided with a further control gate overlying the floating
gate. An intermediate dielectric layer is interposed
