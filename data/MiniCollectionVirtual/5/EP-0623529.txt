Transport apparatus for mass-produced articles, 
especially packing-case lids, for use in a drying 

oven for the drying and/or gelling of lacquered 
and/or coated surfaces, with two endlessly rotating 

conveying means which are located at a distance 
opposite and parallel to one another and between 

which the mass-produced articles are guided individually 
in receiving grooves from a feed station to 

a discharge station, characterized in that each 
conveying means consists of a corrugated hose (12, 

13) with a parallel corrugation which is designed to 
be essentially straight-flanked in order to form the 

receiving grooves (18), and in that each corrugated 
hose (12, 13) slides in a tubular and laterally open 

guide (33). 
Transport apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the guide is designed as a fixed tube 

(33) with a longitudinal slot (35), the free orifice 
cross-section of which has an arc dimension of 

preferably 60 degrees. 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, characterized
 in that the lateral orifice of the 
guide (33) is widened on the entry and exit sides in 

the region of the reception and discharge station 
(14, 15). 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1-3,  
 

characterized in that in that the corrugated hose 
(12, 13) consists of a heat-resistant material, 

preferably high-grade steel or Teflon. 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the corrugated hose (12, 13) 

is driven via a double-toothed toothed belt (45) or 
a pinion having a corrugated-hose profile. 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1-5, 
characterized in that a light barrier is provided as 

a signal generator for a possible intermittent 
movement control of the corrugated hoses (12, 13). 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that the ends of the corrugated 

hose (12, 13) are connected to one another in the 
region of the endless connection by means of a 

clamping device (36) which consists of two 
halfshell-shaped elements (37, 37) bearing against 

the inner wall of the corrugated-hose ends. 
Transport apparatus according to one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that the ends of the corrugated 

hose (12, 13) are foam-filled with a curable 
material (42) in the region of the endless connection. 
Transport apparatus according to Claims 1-8, characterized 
in that the distance between the guides (33) 

forming a conveying stage is variable.
