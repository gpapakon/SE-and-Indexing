<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double-sided silver
halide photographic element sensitive to green light for
medical radiography.In the field of silver halide photographic light
sensitive materials, it is common practice to colour
photographic emulsion layers and other hydrophilic
colloid layers so as to absorb light of specific
wavelengths.Medical x-ray films are often constructed with two
light sensitive layers, one on either side of a
transparent base. The film is imaged by phosphor screens
placed on either side. It is undesirable for the light
emitted from one screen to cross the base and expose the
non-adjacent light sensitive layer. Such cross-over will
lead to a blurred image, poor resolution and loss of
image quality. This cross-over light gives the light
sensitive layer an additional exposure and an apparent
higher speed. The problems associated with cross-over
can be eliminated by the incorporation of coloured
hydrophilic colloid layers between the light sensitive
layer and the base. Ideally, the dye used to colour
these layers should have the following properties:
1) It should have good spectral absorption in the area
of the spectrum where the phosphor screens emit
(e.g., 545nm with green screens).2) It should be photographically inert.3) It should be decolourised by the photographic
processing solution and should not leave any
undesirable colours on the material after
processing.4) It should not diffuse from the coloured layer into
the other layers.5) It should be stable in the photographic material for
long periods of time before processing.Item (4) is particularly important for medical x-ray
materials since the dye-containing layer is adjacent to
the light-sensitive layer. Diffusion of the dye into the
light-sensitive layer can give rise to adverse effects.
The coloured colloid layer must be coated at the same
time as the light sensitive layer to minimise
manufacturing costs. During this process, the light-sensitive
photographic emulsion layer is in contact with
the dye containing layer in the wet state. Diffusion of
dye between these layers is very dependent on the
structure of the dye.A number of suitable dyes have been proposed in the
art. Particulate dyes, mordants with dyes, and oil
dispersed dyes have been used, but these present problems
with simultaneous coating with the photographic emulsion
layer.US 4,925,782 discloses dimeric merocyanine dyes for
dyeing specific colloid layers in photographic light-sensitive
elements. General formula (II) describes
dimeric merocyanine dyes based
