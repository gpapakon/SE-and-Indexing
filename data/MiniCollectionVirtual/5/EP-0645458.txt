<ABSTRACT>
A process for stereoselective (enantioselective) production of S-(-)-fenpropimorph, 
which process comprises reacting 4-
tert
-butylbenzylchloride or bromide with methyldiethylmalonate, 
decarbethoxylation of the product into racemic 3-(4-
tert
-butylphenyl)-2-methylpropionic 
acid ethyl ester in DMSO in the presence of alkali cations, then 


Pseudomonas sp.
 lipase catalyzed resolution of racemic ester to S-(-)-acid, 
base-catalyzed 

racemisation and recycling of the R-(+)-ester, acylation of cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholine 
with 

the activated derivative of S-(-)-acid, and final reduction of the intermediary amide to 
provide optically (enantiomerically) pure S-(-)-fenpropimorph. The key enzymatic reaction 

is fast, employs inexpensive commercially available enzyme, requires minimal work-up, 
and 

can therefore easily be performed on a large scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the new method for production of the optically pure 
(enantiomerically pure compound, EPC) form of S-(-)-1-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylpropyl-cis-3,5-dimethylmorpholine 
(II), one of the most important representatives of 
a new class of systematic fungicides. Racemic form of this compound is commercialized as 
fungicide under the name fenpropimorph. It is already known that racemic compounds general formulae I possess high and specific 
fungicidal activity (Ger. Pat. 2,656,747, Ger. Pat. 2,752,135, both to BASF, AG, 
Ludwigshafen; W. Himmele et al., Angew. chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 19 (1980), 184). They 
show fungicidal activity against wheat mildew, barley mildew and brown rust of wheat, as 
confirmed by numerous field trials in control of cereal diseases (K. Bohnen et al., Proc. Brit. 
Crop Prot. Conf.-Pest. Dis. 1979, 541; J.C. Atkin et al., Proc. Brit. Crop Prot. Conf.-Pest. 
Dis.1981, 307). Fenpropimorph strongly inhibits Δ-14 reduction in the ergosterol synthesis 
pathway. When the mildew-susceptible barley varieties were treated with racemic 
fenpropimorph, strong fungicidal activity was documented (J.K.M. Brown et al., Crop Prot.11 (1992) 44; J.F. Jenkin et al., J. Agric. Sci., 117 (1991) 287). High sensitivity of powder 
mildew (Erysiphe graminis) to fenpropimorph was reported, though some difference was 
related to geographic regions (F.G. Felsenstein, Antifungal Compd., 1(1990) 161). The data presented in literature suggest that the binding conformation of fenpropimorph 
and other tertiary amine fungicides to Δ-8,14-sterol reductase in fungi correlates with a 
pseudo-1,3-diequatorial orientation of the amine moiety (G.S. Besarab et al., ACS Symp. 
Ser. 504 (Synth. Chem. Agrochem III), 1992, 414, Chem. Abstr.118 (1993) 2375e). The 
potent in vitro inhibition of the plant Δ-5,7-sterol Δ-7-reductase by fenpropimorph was 
demonstrated (M. Taton et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 181 (1991) 465). In the 
presence of fenpropimorph sensitive strains of fusarium species accumulated mainly Δ-8,14-sterols, 
whereas the tolerant ones accumulated either both Δ-8,14 and Δ-8-sterols 
or only  
 
Δ-8-sterols. This indicated that fenpropimorph toxicity is related to sterol Δ-14-reductase 
sensitivity (D Debieu et al., Phytochemistry, 31 (1992) 1223). 
   It was demonstrated that the fungicidal activity of 3-phenylpropylamines 
is also 
substantially influenced by the conformation of the whole molecule, and configuration of the 
chiral centre present in 1-(subst.)
