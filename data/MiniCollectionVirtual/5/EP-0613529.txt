<ABSTRACT>
The present invention consists of an anchorage arrangement in form of a socket (1) and anchor bolts (5) for anchoring scaffolds at walls or the like. The socket (1) has an inner cruciformed recess (3) with conical chamfers (4) which are adapted to the form of a conical extension (7) of the anchor bolts (5). When screwing in a anchor bolt (5) the eye (6) of the bolt (5) is placed in the recess (3) of the socket (1), whereby the cone (7) of the bolt (5) and said chamfers (4) cooperate partly to guide the application of the socket (1) onto the bolt (5) and partly to stabilize the bolt (5) in the socket (1) during the operation of screwing itself. The socket (1) is rotated e.g. by a drilling machine whereby the insert pin (2) of the socket is placed in the drill chuck. The cone (7) may be an integrated part of the bolt (5), but is preferably arranged screwable on the bolt (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchorage arrangement for e.g. anchoring 
of scaffolds at walls or the like, which arrangement consists 
of a screw socket and an anchor bolt. At the mounting of scaffolds the scaffold must be anchored in a safe 
way. This is done by securing the scaffold at a large number of points 
by anchor bolts screwed into the wall at which the scaffold is mounted. 
Today this is normally done by first drilling a hole in the wall, and 
then hammering a plug into said hole, whereafter the anchor bolt is 
screwed in manually in the wall in order to anchor the scaffold. It is 
both a tiresome and time consuming work to manually screw in the anchor 
bolts. The background of the invention is the large strains, specially in the 
shoulders, experienced by scaffolders at the up to now used manual 
method to screw in anchor bolts. It has showed in practice that the installers, 
due to being pressed for time, often are careless with the 
important anchoring, as it is both time consuming and tiresome to screw 
in anchor bolts in the prescribed number. Of course this is unacceptable 
from the view point of security. US-A-4689881 shows a driver-apparatus head by which a tightly wound 
loop arrangement of a wire hanger to a screw eyelet is achieved. The 
invention according to this prior art is directed to hanging of wires 
to a ceiling in order to levelly support false ceiling frames or the 
like. An eyelet screw is received in the drive-apparatus head, but the 
apparatus does not include any means to hinder the stem of the eyelet 
screw to strike against the drive-apparatus head during the screwing 
operation. This may lead to difficulties and affect the hole into which 
the screw is screwed. The use of the anchorage according to the invention is not limited to 
scaffolds but can be used anywhere when some kind of anchorage arrangement  
 
is needed. Examples of other fields of use are railings, fences, 
wire carriers, fire-ladders and lifting eye bolts for e.g. rocks. Thus, the object of the present invention is to facilitate to screw in 
the anchor bolts by making it possible to use an ordinary drilling machine 
for the actual screwing in. This object is met with an anchorage arrangement according to the enclosed 
claims.  
 When using the arrangement according to the invention a 
socket is placed in a drill chuck in the normal way. The 
socket has an inner cruciformed recess in which the eye of 
the anchor bolt fits. Furthermore, the anchor bolt is furnished 
with a cone which has a
