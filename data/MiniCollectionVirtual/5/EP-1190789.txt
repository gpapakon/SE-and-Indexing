<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a
device for forming a cutting blade for prints and, more
particularly, to a device capable of forming such a
cutting blade by appropriately bending and cutting a metal
strip into desired blades through integrated work
regardless of a difference in the size of metal strips.In order to produce various flat prints or printed
packing materials, such as paper boxes or thermoplastic
films, it is necessary for flat prints or films to be cut
along a designed cutting line, and for box-shaped packing
materials to be cut along a designed cutting line of a
printed paper board prior to forming the board into a box.Such a cutting process for producing flat prints,
paper boxes, or thermoplastic films has to be performed
using a single-edged cutting blade which extends along a
desired cutting line. Such a cutting blade is set on a
flat wood block in a way such that the blade has a uniform
height. In such a case, the sharpened surface of the
single edge of the blade faces outward. The wood block,
with the cutting blade, is installed on a press, which is
used for cutting such flat prints or packing materials.Typical cutting blades are produced by cutting a thin
special steel strip into pieces. Such a steel strip has
a band-shaped configuration and is sharpened at one edge
prior to being subjected to the bending and cutting
processes. Such a metal strip has to be bent and cut into 
cutting blades which individually form a designed cutting
line along which flat prints or packing materials are cut
by the cutting blade. After the metal strip is bent and
cut into cutting blades, one or more cutting blades are
set on a wood block. Therefore, it is primarily necessary
to precisely bend and cut the metal strip into cutting
blades. In addition, the metal strip is also processed
through a plurality of sub-processes as follows.For example, the metal strip has to be regularly
notched at the lower edge opposite to the sharpened edge,
thus forming bridge notches at the lower edge. Such
bridge notches are for firmly holding the position of a
cutting blade when the blade is set on a wood block. That
is, the bridge notches almost completely prevent the set
position of the cutting blade on the wood block from being
unexpectedly deformed due to external impact. Sometimes,
it is necessary to form a plurality of V-notches along the
sharpened edge of the metal strip, thus form a cutting
blade which is preferably used for forming perforated
lines on prints, such as stamps. Sometimes, the metal

A guide block (2) for guiding and supporting a metal strip (1), 
characterised by
 :

two plates (3) oppositely arranged and each having a surface facing each other with an
elongate fitting channel (3a); and
a bending block (4) held between the two plates (3) that has one side fitted into one of the
elongate fitting channels (3a) and another side fitted into the other of the elongated fitting

channels (3a), the bending block (4) having a guide sized to accommodate the metal strip (1) and to
guide same.
A guide block as in claim 1, wherein said bending block has a bending nozzle (4a) at an
end thereof whose size and configuration is compatible with accommodating a size and

configuration of the metal strip.
A guide block as in claim 1 or claim 2 in combination with a bending pin (31), a
cylinder actuator with a piston that is moveable, a first gear (33) fixed to a lower end of

the cylinder actuator, and a second gear (33a), the first and second gears being spaced
apart from each other and each having a respective pin insert hole (33b) that is in

alignment with the other, the bending pin being moveable in unison with the piston so
as to move between an engaged position, where the bending pin extends from the pin

insert hole of the first gear to engage with the pin hole of the second gear, and a
withdrawn position, where the bending pin is out of engagement with the second pin

insert hole and spaced away from the second gear, the bending pin and the bending
block being arranged to cooperate with each other while the bending pin is in the

engaged position to enable the bending pin to rotate relative to the bending block in
response to rotation of the first and second gears so as to enable a portion of the metal

strip that is guided between the bending pin and the bending block to bend.
A combination as in claim 3, further comprising a gear box containing the second gear,
the gear box being moveable in front, back, left or right directions to adjust a relative

position of the pin insert hole of the second gear with respect to the pin insert hole of 
the first gear to enable alignment of the pin insert holes of the first and second gears

with each other.
A method of guiding and supporting a metal strip (1), 
characterised by
 : arranging two plates
(3) opposite each other, each having an elongate fitting channel (3a) at an inside surface

thereof;

holding a bending block (4) between the two plates (3) by fitting one side of the bending block (4)
into one of the elongated fitting channels (3a) and another of the two sides into the other of

the elongated fitting channels (3a); and
guiding the metal strip (1) into a guide (4a) of the bending block (4).
A method as in claim 5, further comprising sizing a bending nozzle (4a) based on a size
and configuration of the metal strip and arranging the bending nozzle at an end of the

bending block.
