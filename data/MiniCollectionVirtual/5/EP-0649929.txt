<ABSTRACT>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and knitwork 
comprising a load-bearing structure consisting of two sidepieces 

(10) supporting at least one drum (11) which rotates about a 
central shaft (12) and supports on its two lateral endpieces (11a, 

11b) two series of teaseling and/or fluffing rollers of with-pile 
type (13) and against-pile type (14), these being arranged along 

the generators of the drum (11) with those of one series rotating 
relative to those of the other under independent drive, a fabric 

(15) to be treated passing about the teaseling and/or fluffing 
rollers (13, 14) and being fed to the machine by a driven feed 

roller (16) and extracted therefrom by a driven exit roller (17), 
there also being provided brushes (19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which 

interact alternately with the teaseling and/or fluffing rollers 
(13, 14), in which the with-pile (13) and against-pile (14) 

teaseling and/or fluffing rollers are provided with support means 
(27, 11a, 11b), they rotate rigidly with each other and are  

 
provided with means (33, 34, 35) which cause them to undergo axial 

shift combined with their rotary movement, so as to achieve 
equalization of the action on the article both in the warp 

direction and in the weft direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a teaseling and/or fluffing machine for
fabric and knitwork.Known teaseling and/or fluffing machines are composed essentially
of one or more drums rotating with predetermined direction and
speed, along their circumference there being housed a certain
number of teaseling and/or fluffing rollers. If the rollers are
teaseling rollers they are embraced by cloth carrying the needles
alternately in the same direction as the fabric (with the pile)
and in the opposite direction (against the pile), they rotating
about themselves under independent control. The same applies to
fluffing rollers, which carry an abrasive paper covering instead
of cloth carrying needles. These rollers also rotate with
predeterminable speed and direction.The fabric to be teaseled and/or fluffed wraps a considerable part
of the drum circumference and part of the teaseling and/or
fluffing rollers, it being fed via an entry roller and extracted
from the drum via an exit roller. These entry and exit rollers
also rotate at predetermined speed, depending on the working or
advancement speed of the fabric.The speed of the two rollers can be different and predetermined in 
relation to the desired fabric tension.In particular the teaseling and/or fluffing rollers have a speed
and direction of rotation predetermined on the basis of the
required effects, but have a single rotary movement such as to
effect on the fabric an operation of fibre extraction and abrasion
only in the direction of the fabric warp; they hence perform a
reduced and unbalanced action because any operation in the
direction of the fabric weft is lacking.This results in non-homogeneous action on the fabric surface.GB-A-1 367 412 discloses a machine according to the preamble of claim 1.The object of the present invention is to solve the aforesaid
problems.This object is attained according to the present invention by a
teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and knitwork according to claim 1. The characteristics and advantages of a teaseling and/or fluffing
machine according to the present invention will be more apparent
from the ensuing description given by way of non-limiting example
with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a cross-section through the teaseling and/or fluffing
machine according to the present invention taken on the line I-I
of Figure 3:Figure 2 is an enlarged view of a teaseling and/or fluffing roller
shown partly in section; andFigure 3 is a section on the line III-III of Figure 1.The figures

<CLAIMS>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and
knitwork comprising essentially a load-bearing structure

consisting of two sidepieces (10) supporting at least one drum
(11) which rotates about a central shaft (12) and supports on its

two lateral endpieces (11a, 11b) two series of teaseling and/or
fluffing rollers of with-pile type (13) and against-pile type

(14), these being arranged along the generators of said drum (11)
with those of one series rotating relative to those of the other

under independent drive, a fabric (15) to be treated passing about
said teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14) and being fed to

the machine by a driven feed roller (16) and extracted therefrom
by a driven exit roller (17), there also being provided brushes

(19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which interact alternately with said

teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14), wherein
said with-pile (13) and against-pile (14) teaseling and/or

fluffing rollers are provided with support means (27, 11a, 11b),
rotate rigidly with each other and are provided with cam means

(33, 34, 35) which cause them to undergo axial shift combined with
their rotary movement, so as to achieve equalization of the action

on the article both in the warp direction and in the weft
direction,
 
characterised in that said with-pile (13) and against

pile (14) teaseling and/or fluffing rollers are
arranged on a sleeve (28) the ends of which are

inserted in said support means (27), through said sleeve
(28) there passing a shaft (29), and

in that said cam means determining a continuous axial
shift of said teaseling and/or fluffing rollers

(13,14) comprise a peripheral recess (33) which is
formed, inclined to the axis of said rollers, within

an enlarged extension (34) of said sleeve (28) and
into which there is inserted an inwardly projecting

pawl (35) rigid with a box extension (36) of one of a
pair of supports (32) for said bearings projecting

inwards.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in
claim 1, characterised in that said perimetral recess

(33) has an inclination to the axis of the teaseling
and/or fluffing rollers (13,14), which is adjustable.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in
claim 1, characterised in that said support means are

roller bearings (27) secured to said lateral endpieces
(11a,11b) of said drum (11).
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in
claim 1, characterised in that said sleeve (28) is

free to shift axially on said shaft (29) but is
rotationally rigid therewith.
