<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel heterocyclic 
compounds, a process for the preparation thereof and a insecticide. By virtue of research and development of insecticides for 
many years, a number of insecticides, for example organophosphorus 
insecticides such as parathion and malathion, and carbamate insecticides 
such as carbaryl and methomyl, have been developed and used 
in practice. The contribution these insecticides to the improvement 
of agricultural production yield are great. However, in recent years some of these insecticides have had 
their use regulated because of problems such as invironmental 
pollution due to residue or accumulation, or because they cause 
infestation of resistant insect pests as a result of long-term use. 
Therefore, the development of novel insecticidal compounds which 
have excellent insecticidal propterty against insecticide-resistant 
pest insect species as well as other various pest insects and can be 
safely used is highly demanded. As cross references, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No.Sho 63-150275, No.Hei 3-190859 which disclosed the compounds 
having similar structural formula to the heterocyclic compounds of 
this invention have been known. It is an object of the present invention to provide an agricultural 
chemical which can be manufactured advantageously on an 
industrial scale and can be used safely as well as having firm 
insecticidal effectiveness. The present invention is directed at compounds having the 
general formula [I]: 
wherein
 
Z is an unsubstituted or substituted 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic 
group containing nitrogen;
 
X is a carbon, nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen atom;
 
Y is, when X is a carbon atom, (a) in a form of -Y-X; 
(a) 
 
when X is a nitrogen atom, (b) or (c) in a form of -Y-X; (b) 
(c) 
 
when X is a sulfur atom, (d), (e) or (f) in a form of -Y-X; (d) 
(e) 
(f) 
 
when X is an oxygen atom, (g) or (h) in a form of -Y-X; (g) 
(h) 
 
 
R₂ is an electron attractive group other than nitro, cyano and trifluoroacetyl;
 
R₁ and R₃ ∼ R₂₅ are independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or 
an unsubstituted or substituted lower alkyl;
 
Or, Y is, when X is a carbon atom, (i) in a form of -Y-X; (i) 
 
R₂ is an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyle carbonyl, other 
than furancarbonyl, thiophenecarbonyl and pyridinecarbonyl;
 
R₂₆ ∼ R₂₉ are independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or an 
unsubstituted or substituted lower alkyl;
 
and a process for the preparation of the compounds and an insecticide. Electron attractive
