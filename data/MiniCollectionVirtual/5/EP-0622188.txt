<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a white, opaque, biaxially stretched multilayered film having good heat-sealing properties and a paper-like appearance on at least one side, comprising an opaque core and at least one outer layer comprising:   10-15% by weight of an isotactic polypropylene having a density of 0.9-0.91 g/cm
<
3
>
 and a melt flow index of from 0.5 g/10 min to 8 g/10 min at 230@C and a load of 21.2N (determined in accordance with DIN 53735), - 5-15% by weight of a linear low-density copolymer of ethylene which has been modified by means of rubber and maleic anhydride, - 40-80% by weight of a random propylene-ethylene copolymer containing 2-6% by weight of ethylene or a random terpolymer of propylene, ethylene and butylene having a comonomer content of 
<
 15 % by weight and a butylene content of 
<
 7 % by weight, and 5-15% by weight of an inorganic filler, preferably titanium dioxide of the rutile type, having a mean diameter of 200 mm.

A white-opaque biaxially oriented multilayer
polypropylene film with good heat-sealing properties

and with a paper-like appearance on at least one side,
comprising an opaque core and an outer layer made of:


10 - 15 wt.% of an isotactic polypropylene having a
density of 0.9 - 0.91 g/cm
3
 and a melt-flow index of
0.5 g/10 min to 8 g/10 min at 230Â°C under 21.2 N load

(determined to DIN 53735),
5 - 15 wt.% either of a linear copolymer of low-density
ethylene modified with rubber and with maleic

acid anhydride, or of a linear polyethylene modified
with maleic acid anhydride,
up to 80 wt.% of a statistical propylene/ethylene
random copolymer containing 2 to 6 wt.% of ethylene or

a statistical terpolymer of propylene, ethylene and
butylene having a butylene content of 
>
7 wt.% and a
propylene content of more than 80 wt.% and 5 - 15 wt.%

of an inorganic filler, and
a second outer layer which is either identical with
the first outer layer or consists of two layers Z and

S, the layer Z serving as an intermediate layer and
consisting of polypropylene and a pigment and the

layer S consisting of propylene/ethylene random
copolymers.
A multilayer film according to claim 1, characterised
in that it is corona pretreated on one side.
A multilayer film according to claims 1 and 3,
characterised in that it can be metallised. 
A multilayer film according to claims 1 - 3,
characterised in that it can be provided with cold-seal

material.
A multilayer film according to claims 1 - 4,
characterised in that the outer layer is printed or

metallised or provided with a cold-seal material.
