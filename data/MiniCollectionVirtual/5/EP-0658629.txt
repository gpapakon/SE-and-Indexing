<ABSTRACT>
A polyol fatty acid ester having mixted acid 
groups is produced by reacting a partial ester of 

a polyol and a branched fatty acid with a a straight 
fatty acid or a lower alcohol ester thereof in the 

presence of a lipase. The obtained glyceride mixture 
contains a large amount of diglyceride having a branched, 

saturated fatty acid group and a straight, saturated 
fatty acid group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the preparation of polyol fatty acid esters. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a 
process for preparing a polyol fatty acid ester having 
a mixed acid residue of a branched fatty acid and a 
straight-chain fatty acid in the molecule at a high purity 
easily obtained according to the enzyme method. Then the 
invention relates to a glyceride mixture obtained by the 
process and a composition containing the glyceride mixture 
for the external use and cosmetic use. As the process for the industrial production of 
fatty acid esters, which is practically worked, there 
can be mentioned an esterification process and an 
alcoholysis process. However, a process for preparing 
at a high purity a polyol fatty acid ester having a 
mixed acid residue of a branched fatty acid and a 
straight-chain fatty acid in the molecule, which is 
intended in the present invention, is much restricted.  In the case where a polyol is esterified with 
a mixed fatty acid of a branched fatty acid and a 
straight-chain fatty acid in the presence or absence 
of a catalyst, since the reactivity of hydroxyl groups 
of the polyol is not selective, various polyol fatty 
acid esters having random ester linkages are 
synthesized. For example, in the synthesis of a glycerol ester 
with a branched fatty acid (B) and a straight-chain 
fatty acid (S), if the triglyceride is intended, 
there is formed a mixture in which six triglycerides 
are radomly distributed 
according to the fatty acid composition, wherein 
represents glycerol. If the diglyceride is intended, 
there are formed three diglycerides 
(neglecting the distinction between 1,2-diglyceride 
and 1,3-diglyceride) and the above-mentioned 
triglyceride mixture. As the process for preparing a polyol ester having 
a mixed acid residue of a branched fatty acid and 
a straight-chain fatty acid (in the above-mentioned 
example, 
in the case of the triglycride  
 
and 
in the case of the diglyceride), there can 
be considered a process in which a mixture formed by 
the esterification is subjected to the solvent 
fractionation and a fraction of the ester having a 
mixed acid residue is concentrated. However, if the 
difference of the melting point or solubility is 
small, the concentration is substantially impossible, 
and even if a high concentration is obtained, the 
yield is very low and the process is not practically 
satisfactory. There can be considered another process in which 
a partial ester of a branched fatty acid or a
