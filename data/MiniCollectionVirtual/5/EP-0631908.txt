<ABSTRACT>
An inflator (12), which is shorter than a reaction 
can (10) of an airbag restraint assembly and which has a 

flangeless base (30) at one end thereof, is mounted in the 
reaction can. The mounting structure (34) for the 

flangeless inflator has a generally circular open 
cylindrical shape, with its sidewall (38) terminated at a 

first end in a mounting flange (40) and terminating on the 
other end thereof in a resilient arm (46) flared radially 

outward at the end thereof. Preferably, intermediate the 
mounting flange and the resilient arm is a radially-inwardly-extending 

integral circumferential rib or discrete 
dimples (44). The mounting flange of the mounting 

structure is located in an opening (36) in an end wall of 
the reaction can, with the resilient arm frictionally 

engaging and holding the flangeless base of the inflator in 
the reaction can while the intermediate rib or discrete 

dimples prevent any significant rearward axial movement of 
the inflator in the reaction can thereby providing 

essentially rattle- and squeak-free retention of the 
flangeless based inflator in the reaction can in an 

appropriately positioned and centred manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle airbag restraint
systems, and more particularly to a mounting structure for
mounting a flangeless based (i.e. non-flanged) inflator, which
is shorter than a reaction can of an airbag restraint assembly,
in the reaction can of such an assembly.A vehicular airbag restraint system generally includes
a pyrotechnic inflator which may comprise a cylindrical housing
which encloses some form of gas generating material which, when
ignited, generates a non-toxic inert gas under pressure within
the housing. The inflator, along with an uninflated, folded
airbag which is to be inflated by the gas, is disposed in an
internal cavity of a reaction can along with means to control
deployment. In an emergency situation inert gas is generated in
the inflator housing and the gas is directed rapidly through a
plurality of nozzles formed in the inflator housing and into the
airbag to force the airbag out of the reaction can to inflate the
airbag. One location for such a vehicular airbag restraint
system is in the instrument panel or dashboard on the passenger
side of the vehicle for passive protection of a passenger in the
vehicle.Some inflators are constructed with a flanged base at
one end of the cylindrical housing, while other inflators are
designed without a flanged base. In either case, packaging and
weight limitations may require airbag inflators to be shorter
than the reaction cans in which they are housed. This situation 
requires an inflator to reaction can interface device that
is cost effective, durable and squeak- and rattle-free and
will center and support the flangeless based end of the
inflator without the benefit of a flanged base.A mounting for an inflator with a flanged end is
described in US-A-5069480. This shows a reaction can with a
pair of opposed end walls, the inflator being inserted
through an opening in a first end wall and pushed into the
reaction can until its leading end is received and supported
in a recessed boss on the second end wall. The end flange
of the inflator abuts the outside of the first end wall and
is secured by an end cap or retainer.GB-A-2265582 discloses an arrangement in which a
flangeless inflator is secured to one end wall of a reaction
can by a threaded stud while its free end projects through
an aperture in the opposite end wall where it is surrounded
by a rubber bushing.It is an object of this invention to provide a mounting
structure for mounting a flangeless based (i.e. non-flanged)
inflator, which is shorter than the reaction can in

<CLAIMS>
An airbag restraint inflator assembly comprising
an inflator (12) having a generally cylindrical housing

(26), a reaction can (10) having an opening (36) in a first
end wall (20) thereof adapted to receive and position an

inflator within a cavity (14) of said reaction can and
mounting means (34) at said opening for securing the

inflator in position in the reaction can, characterised in
that


the inflator (12) is shorter in dimension than the
reaction can, and has a flangeless base (30) on a first end

thereof nearest said opening (36),
said reaction can mounting means (34) comprising a
generally open, right circular cylindrical shaped tube

formed by a circular sidewall (38), said sidewall
terminating at one end thereof with a radially extending

mounting flange (40) having an outer diameter greater than a
diameter of said first end wall opening (36) and terminating

in a resilient arm (42) on the other end of said sidewall,
said mounting means being located in said reaction can
first end wall opening with said resilient arm engaging and

holding the inflator housing (26) by biased radial
compression force.
An inflator assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein
said inflator (12) is terminated on a second
 and opposite
end thereof in a threaded stud (32) protruding through a

shaped hole (56) in a second and opposite end wall (22) of
said reaction can, said shaped hole being adapted to receive

said threaded stud, and a nut (58) mounted on said stud for
mounting and securing said second end of said inflator in

said reaction can.

an index key is provided on the threaded stud end (32) of the

inflator and received in the shaped hole (56).

mounting cup (50) positioned in an access opening in said

second end wall (22) of said reaction can, said mounting cup
having a flat bottom (54) with a shaped opening (56) therein

for receiving the threaded stud (32) and the index key on
the second end of said inflator, said flat bottom of said

mounting cup being clamped between the nut on the threaded
stud and the second end (22) of the inflator for centring

and retention of the inflator (12) in the cavity (14) of the
reaction can (10).
An inflator assembly as claimed in any preceding
claim wherein:
