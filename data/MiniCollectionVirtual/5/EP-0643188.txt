<ABSTRACT>
A drive and securing device for the window 
glass in automobile vehicles, with a support part (A) 

which is in turn a guide in the track (B) and a 
support for the glass (C). This support (A) has an 

upper U-shaped portion with two facing projections 
(9) and (10) with their divergent faces downwards. 

The upper straight portion of the projection (9) 
includes a pivot (3) which is housed in the hole (2) 

in the glass and is offset in relation to the front 
of the projection (10). The advantage of the invention 

is that it is easy to assemble the glass onto the 
support and also to dismantle it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive and securing
device for the glass in a vehicle window and, more specifically,
to an improved solution for housing the window
glass onto a part, which in turn is the drive element for
the said window, by its sliding along a guide fixed to
the interior of the vehicle door.Already known, through the German publication DE-A-3243123,
is an assembly according to which the glass is
provided with a drill hole near its lower edge and the
support for the said glass has a lower U-shaped part, in
which the said lower edge of the glass is housed. In this
solution, a pin, connected to the support, engages in the
hole in the glass in such a way that the movements of the
window in a direction perpendicular to its side surface
are prevented by means of a flange on the pin and a ring-shaped
spacer placed between the glass and the support.The assembly of the glass into the support is quite
complicated, as it first requires the lower edge of the
glass to be inserted into the U-shaped recess before the
pin can be fitted.Also known, through publication EP. 0208237, is a
combination of a window glass and a support to connect
this said glass to its corresponding drive device. The
glass is provided with a drill hole near its lower edge,
and the support has a pin which engages in this drill
hole. In this assembly, a main support tongue is provided,
together with a set of auxiliary tongues situated parallel
to the main one, thus forming a "staggered" arrangement.The pin is supported by the main tongue and at
least one of the auxiliary tongues is elastically deformable 
mable in a direction perpendicular to the side surfaces
of the glass.The disadvantage of this assembly is that all the
tongues are elastically deformable and short in height,
with which the seating of the glass in the support is
limited. Moreover, the pin is centred in relation to the
window track, which makes it difficult to reach the said
pin when so desired, for instance, in order to change
the glass. On the other hand, we wish to emphasise that
a window winder device is a part which is closely related
to the volumes and shapes adopted by automobile vehicles
throughout their evolution, during which the window
winder has developed from a device with a simple vertical
movement to the present models which have rake angles
of 15º or even more.In those window winders in which the drive mechanism
travels along cylindrical rails, different alternatives
are adopted in order to make this drive mechanism
follow the helicoidal path taken
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Automobile vehicle window drive and securing
device, with a sliding support (A) in a rail profile (B)

and a glass window (C) with a drill hole (2) through it
near its lower edge (15), with the support having a U-shaped

portion in which the said lower edge (15) of the glass
(C) is received,with a pivot (3) connected to the upper

profile or edge (9) of the support (A) that engages into
the drill hole (2), which is characterized in that the support

(A), which is at the same time the slide that travels
along the guide rail (B), is provided with a contour

or rib (16) that acts as a base for two facing projections
or branches (8) which are joined to the profile of the

edge (9), forming an inverted U or bridge that allows its
sidewards movement (±d), in that the contour or rib (16)

is provided with a reinforcing wall (17) to provide
strength to the whole of the assembly of the part (A) and

in particular to a pair of lugs (5, 6) and a stop (7) that
are used to receive the lower end of the glass, in that

another rigid projection (10) integrated into the slide
(A) is established facing the edge (9), in that this edge

(9) is provided with flexibility due to the special shape
of its profile and in that the rigid projection is centrally

arranged in relation to the flexible projection or
edge (9), in that the facing sides of both projections (9)

and (10) are divergent from their upper ends and towards
the ribbing of the support, in that the straight portion

of the profile or edge (9) forms part of a pivot (3) that
juts out towards the projection (10), with this pivot

being housed in the hole (2) in the glass (C) and located 
in a position distant from the vertical centre of the support

(A), which is outside the frontal axis occupied by
the projection (10), so that it is not intercepted by the

profile of the rail and its penetration into the glass can
be observed visually, or made easier to extract when necessary,

without any interruption, in that on the rib (16)
and just below the pivot (3), a pair of facing lugs (5, 6)

project upwards so as to support the lower edge (15) of
the glass (C), thus allowing this to turn (±B) in relation

to the centre of the pivot, with the portion (7) of the
edge (16) being raised below these lugs in the form of a

stop, and with the front of the pivot (3) having a blind
recess (14) which allow it to be manipulated from the exterior

by means of the end of a tool in order to release the
glass.
