<ABSTRACT>
The data selector (59) provides the recording signal Data 1 as LD recording signal LD
Data 1 and the output control signal Data 3' as LD recording signal LD Data 3, and fixes the

LD recording signal LD Data 2 to H level. The S
&
H select circuit (58) supplies an inverted
one of the NRZI signal to the enable terminal of the sample and hold circuit (53). The sample

and hold circuit (53) samples an output of the bias power 1 part and supplies it as LD control
signal LDC 2 to the APC circuit (55). Thus, the bias power 1 being a light power of the

multi-pulse is sampled by the sample and hold circuit (53) and controlled by the APC circuit
(55).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data recording, and also to an optical disc drive. An
illustrative embodiment of the present invention relates to a phase-change drive of a high
transfer rate, and more particularly, to a phase-change optical disc drive with a semiconductor
laser power control and a method of writing/reading a phase-change optical disc at a high
transfer rate by controlling the laser power of the semiconductor laser.Typical phase-change optical discs in which information can be rewritten include a so-called
DVD-RAM. DVD-RAM adopts an EFM (Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation) method for
signal modulation to drive a semiconductor laser to emit multi-pulses for generation of
recording waveforms for marks of 3T to 11T.FIG. 1 is a timing chart of recording waveforms in DVD-RAM. As shown, a mark 3T
is written with a single light pulse while a mark 11T is recorded with nine light pulses. Each
light pulse is immediately followed by a bias power 2 set to a lower value than a bias power
1corresponding to an erasure power to control the crystallization speed of the phase-changed
recording medium. Further, both leading and trailing pulses have a period of about 1T, and
they are generated with predetermined time delays (TSFP and TSLP in FIG. 1), respectively,
from the clock pulse.DVD-RAM uses a clock frequency of 29 MHz (user transfer rate of 11 Mbps). 
Both the leading and trailing pulses have a width of about 35 ns. The recording power of
these light pulses is detected by a laser power monitoring detector, and then sampled and
given a predetermined value, thus the recording pulse is controlled to always have a constant
power. For example, the peak power is controlled by sampling the light power of the leading
or trailing pulse, and the bias power 1 is controlled by sampling the light output of the multi-pulse.
Note that the bias power 2 is controlled by sampling a reproducing output detected by
an RF signal detector.For a phase-change optical disc drive of a higher transfer rate than the normal one of
DVD-RAM, however, it is necessary to increase the clock frequency. For a clock frequency
of 100 MHz (use transfer rate of 38 Mbps), for example, the leading and trailing pulses will
have a width of less than 10 ns, so it will be difficult to accurately sample the light output for
controlling the recording power. Furthermore, when the light pulse is less than 10 ns in
width, it will easily be affected by noise component and also a sufficient band of the optical
system cannot be assured, so that the recording
