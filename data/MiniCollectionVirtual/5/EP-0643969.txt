<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition for renal disorder 
and a dialysis solution for extracorporeal hemodialysis 

which comprise a phosphoric acid diester of the 
following formula: 


(wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group) or a 

pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. 
Since the composition of this invention inhibits 
the formation of free radicals in the body, it can be 

advantageously used for the prophylaxis and treatment 
of various renal disorders such as glomerulonephritis, 

acute renal failure, uremia, adriamycin nephrosis, 
puromycin nephrosis, gentamicin- and cisplatin-induced 

disorders of the kidney, renal impairment due to 
paraquat and other agricultural chemicals, and immune 

complex nephritis. Moreover, the composition of this  
 

invention is also of use as a dialysis solution for 
extracorporeal hemodialysis with the 

propylactic/therapeutic effect on dialysis amyloidosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an ascorbyl tocopheryl diester
of phosphoric acid or a pharmacologically acceptable salt
thereof, for the manufacture of a dialysis solution for extracorporeal
hemodialysis.It is known that the active oxygen species and free radicals
formed in the body may cause aging and a broad spectrum of diseases
inclusive of malignant neoplasms. The kidney, in particular,
is highly relevant to such active oxygen species and free
radicals because of the vital physiological functions assigned
to this organ.EP-A-0 324 387 and EP-A-0 430 045 disclose that ascorbic acid
tocopheryl phosphate diesters are suitable for inhibition of
Maillard's reaction in the human body;EP-A-0 409 999 discloses a liquid preparation for intraocular
perfusion, in particular an intraocular irrigating solution which
reduces risks for damage to intraocular tissues, which is used
when, in the field of surgical treatment of ophthalmic diseases,
the site of operation is inside the eyeball;Neurosciences Vol. 15, pp. 371-376 (1989) discloses a new hydroxyl
radical Scavenger: EPC-K1; andBiochemical Pharmacology Vol. 44, No. 6 pp. 1193-1199, 1992
discloses the role of lipid peroxidation in the nephrotoxicity
of cisplatin. Meanwhile, chronic hemodialysis induces dialysis
amyloidosis in the patient on dialysis treatment. As a
therapeutic approach, the use of a high-performance
dialysis membrane is gaining popularity for eliminating
β 2-microglobulin (β 2-MG) which is a causative agent
of amyloidosis. However, when this dialysis treatment
is performed chronically, symptomatic aggravations are
sometimes experienced despite improvements in the β 2-MG
picture and it has been pointed out that free
radicals are involved in the onset of dialysis
amyloidosis as well. However, it is the state of the
art that there is not known a dialysis solution for
extracorporeal hemodialysis which is effective for the
prevention and treatment of amyloidosis.Under the circumstances, a real demand exists in
the art for a hemodialysis solution which
would successfully inhibit the formation of, or
scavenge, free radicals in vivo and, as such, be useful
for the prophylaxis and therapy of dialysis amyloidosis. The inventors of this invention long studying the
pharmacological actions of ascorbyl tocopheryl diester
of phosphoric acid discovered that this compound
effectively inhibits the formation of free radicals in
the body and scavenges them and is of value as
a dialysis
solution for extracorporeal hemodialysis. This
invention has been
