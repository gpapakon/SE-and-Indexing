The second waveguiding micromember includes a light output coupling (18) for providing light output from the laser without adversely affecting the Q value and low lasing threshold of the microcavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with Government support
under Grant Number: ECS-9210434 awarded by the National
Science Foundation and Grant Number: F30602-94-1-0003
awarded by the Advanced Research Project Agency of the
Department of Defense. The Government may have certain
rights in the invention.The present invention relates to microcavity
semiconductor lasers and, more particularly, to
microdisk, microcylinder, microannulus and like
semiconductor lasers.Microcavity semiconductor lasers recently have been
described for operation at liquid nitrogen temperature
and room temperature. Such microcavity semiconductor
lasers employ an active lasing medium that supports
optical modes in the form of a whispering gallery mode
where photons skimming around the circumference of a
microdisk or microcylinder having an appropriately small
diameter are continually totally reflected. The thin
microdisk or microcylinder is positioned in a
surrounding medium (e.g. air) having a high contrast of
refractive index relative to that of the active lasing
medium such that the optical mode is strongly confined
inside the microdisk or microcylinder in the vertical
direction and coupled to the active lasing medium
comprising one or more quantum wells. For example, a
whispering-gallery-mode microdisk semiconductor laser is
described by McCall et al. in "Whispering-gallery mode
microdisk lasers" in Appl. Phys. Lett. 60, (3), 20
January 1992. A whispering-gallery-mode microcylinder
semiconductor laser is described by Levi et al. in
"Room-temperature lasing action in In0.51Ga0.49P/In0.2Ga0.8As 
microcylinder laser diodes" in Appl. Phys. Lett. 62, (17), 26 April 1993.Microcavity semiconductor lasers are advantageous as compared to
conventional semiconductor lasers in being much smaller in size and requiring
substantially less minimum operating current (power) in the range of
microwatts. However, there is no directional coupling of light out from such
microcavity lasers. In fact, the photons are strongly confined inside the
microdisk or microcylinder. This is disadvantageous in that a directional
coupling of light out of the laser is necessary for useful applications.Recently, in "Directional light coupling from microdisk lasers", Appl.
Phys. Lett. 62, 561 (1993) an asymmetric point was introduced into a single
circular microdisk to provide a location of increased quantity of lasing light to
leak out from the point of asymmetry. Moreover, there has been a suggestion
to provide grating fabricated directly on the microdisk to couple light
theref
