<ABSTRACT>
The temperature of a current-regulated electric coil 1, for example the coil of an electromagnetic proportional valve of a hydraulic setting device in a motor vehicle, is determined by measuring the ohmic resistance of the coil winding. The average current through the coil 1 is regulated by a control and evaluation circuit 5, using a pulse-width-modulated setting signal (PWM). At a temperature of the coil 1 which coincides with the temperature of a temperature sensor 8, a correction value is determined, which takes into account the disturbance influence of the other resistances in the coil circuit 4 on the temperature thereof. The temperature of the coil 1 is then calculated from its supply voltage UK/15, the mark-space ratio of the coil current Icoil and the coil current itself, taking into account the correction value.

Circuit arrangement, contained in a control
unit (9), for determining the temperature of a current-regulated

electric coil (1), in particular the coil of
an electromagnetic proportional valve of a hydraulic

actuating apparatus, by measuring the non-reactive
resistance of the coil winding,

 it is provided with a control and
evaluation circuit (5),


by which the average current (

temperature sensor (8) contained in the control unit,
a correction value

 is determined which takes
account of the interfering influence of the other

resistances (Î£

temperature thereof, and
by means of which the temperature of the coil (1) is
calculated from the supply voltage (
U
K115
) thereof, the
mark-space ratio (msr) of the coil current (
I
coil
) and
the coil current itself, with the correction value

(TA) being taken into account.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the control and evaluation

circuit (5) is designed as a microprocessor, and in
that the latter determines the voltage drop in the coil 

circuit (4) and outputs the pulse width-modulated
actuating signal 
(PWM)
 which effects regulation of the
coil current.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the coil circuit (4) contains a

power switch

characterized
in that the average current through the coil is
regulated with a pulse width-modulated actuating

signal,
in that at a coil temperature which is adjusted with
the temperature of a temperature sensor arranged in a

control unit, a correction value is determined which
takes account of the interfering influence of the

other resistances in the coil circuit (4) at the
temperature thereof, and
in that the temperature of the coil is calculated
from the supply voltage thereof, the mark-space ratio

of the coil current and the coil current itself, with
the correction value being taken into account.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that a computer (6) is connected to a diagnostic input

of a microprocessor (5), the determination of the
temperature correction value (TA) by the microprocessor

(5) being initiated by the said computer.
