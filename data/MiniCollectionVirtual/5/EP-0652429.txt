<ABSTRACT>
In a fiber optic probe for an infrared analysis 
instrument, a window block (37) made of sapphire is 

provided having an inner face (4) in the shape of a 
truncated cone. A fiber optic cable has its distal 

end adjacent to the inner face of the window block and 
the optic fibers in the distal end are segregated into 

transmitting fibers (13) adjacent to said conical section 
of the inner face of the window block and receiving 

fibers (17) abutting the central circular portion formed by 
the truncated cone shape of the inner face. A 

cylindrical separator (47) separates the receiving and 
transmitting fibers at the distal end of the fiber 

optic cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to near infrared spectral
analysis instruments and, more particularly, to a near
infrared spectral analysis instrument with an improved
fiber optic probe to transmit and receive light from
a sample.A powerful technology for analyzing matter
involves measuring the reflectance from or the
transmission through the matter to be analyzed at a
narrow band wavelength in the near infrared region
known as NIR. To carry out such analysis, the matter
is irradiated with NIR light and the amount of light
transmitted through or reflected from the matter at
narrow band wavelengths is measured and analyzed.
Instruments for making such analyses are disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,969,739 to Phillip A. McGee, U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,264,205 and 4,285,596 to Issac J. Landa
and U.S. Patent No. 4,040,747 to Donald R. Webster.
Frequently, such infrared analyzing instruments employ
a fiber optic probe as a convenient technique to
transmit the light from a near infrared source to the
sample to be analyzed and to receive diffusely
reflected light back from the sample and transmit the
received light back to the instrument. A window is
employed in the distal end of the probe between the
transmitting fibers and the sample, which window must
be transmissive to infrared light. Typically, the
window is made of sapphire or quartz and has a
relatively high index of refraction. The surfaces of 
the window, and particularly the outer surface of the
window being a plane optical surface at which the
index of refraction changes abruptly, has a tendency
to specularly reflect light and it is important to
prevent this specularly reflected light from being
received by the receiving optical fibers in the fiber
optic probe and transmit it back to the instrument as
such specularly reflected light intertwines with the
instrument capability of detecting the intensity
diffusely reflected light from the sample.U.S. Patent No. 5,166,756, issued November 24,
1992 to Phillip McGee et al., discloses a fiber optic
probe which achieves elimination of spectral
reflection by forming the outer face of a window block
of the probe skewed at an angle to the axis of the
probe. Pending U.S. application Serial No. 07/931,783
discloses a probe with a two-piece window with a
window block having a skewed internal face to prevent
spectral reflection from being received.The present invention provides a fiber optic probe according to claim 1 and a
window block adapted for use in the probe according to claim 5. The features of
the preamble to claim 1 are

<CLAIMS>
A fiber optic probe (15) for a spectral analysis instrument having a first set of
optical fibers (17) and a second set of optical fibers (13) and a window block

(37) having an inner face adjacent to the distal ends of said first and said
second sets of optical fibers and having an outer face (38) opposite said inner

face, whereby the distal ends of said second set of optical fibers are arranged
around the distal ends of the first set, 
characterized in that
 said inner face of said
window block has a first planar section (41) arranged perpendicularly to the

distal ends of said fiber optics of said first set, and a second section at an angle
to said first section, the distal ends of said first set of optical fibers being

positioned closely adjacent to said first section of said inner face so that light
received by the said window block through said outer face of said window block

is transmitted to and received by said first set of optic fibers, said second
section of said inner face of said window block being opposite to the distal ends

of said second set of optic fibers to receive light transmitted from said second
set of optic fibers and to refract light through said window block to said outer

face of said window block, said window block being shaped so that light
refracted to said outer face by said second section of said inner face and

specularly reflected from said outer face is directed away from the distal ends of
said first set of optic fibers. 
A probe as recited in claim 1 wherein said inner face is in the form of a truncated
cone, said first section comprising a flat center portion of said truncated cone

and said second section comprising the conical surface of said truncated cone.
A probe as recited in claim 1, wherein said first and second sections of said inner
face are separated by a boundary between said first and second sections and

wherein a separator (47) is provided between said first and second sets of
optical fibers which is aligned with said boundary.
A probe as recited in any of claims 1-3 further comprising means to transmit
light to said window through said second set of optic fibers (13) and means to

receive light transmitted from said window through said first set of optic fibers
(17).
A window block (37) adapted for use in the fiber optic probe according to
claims 1-4 comprising a block of transparent material having an inner face and

an outer face 
characterized in that
 said inner face is formed in the shape of a
truncated cone concentric about an axis of said window block, the outer face

being perpendicular to said axis of said window block, said inner face
comprising a central flat portion (41) and a conical portion (39), and said window

block further comprising a sidewall extending from said conical portion to said
outer face.
A window block as recited in claim 5, having sidewalls extending between said
inner face and said outer face shaped as a surface of revolution about said axis.
A window block as recited in claim 6, wherein said side walls are tapered from
said outer face to said inner face.
