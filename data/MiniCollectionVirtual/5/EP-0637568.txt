<ABSTRACT>
In treating night soil utilizing exhaust gases from an internal combustion engine, a space for storing flushing 
water is reduced, time required for the night soil treatment is shortened, both feces and urine can be suitably treated, 

and the urination and evacuation are permitted even during the treatment. A heat accumulator is provided in a route 
for discharging exhaust gases from the internal combustion engine and urine and flushing water which are discharged 

from a water closet are heated in a drying chamber by the heat accumulated in the heat accumulator and separated 
into steam and night soil residue. The thus separated steam is recovered in a water storage chamber and reused as 

flushing water. Furthermore, the night soil residue which has deposited in the drying chamber is scratched off by a 
scratching member and sucked by a sucking device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating human waste 
and an apparatus for treating human waste which is installed in 
a vehicle or a vessel and utilizes its internal combustion engine 
for a drying treatment of the human waste, as well as vehicles 
and vessels which are equipped with this apparatus. An example of the conventional methods of treating human 
waste and apparatuses for treating human waste is described in 
Japanese unexamined patent publication (Tokkai) Hei 2-102778. In this conventional method, human waste, in small fixed 
quantities, is fed into a flash chamber which is indirectly 
heated using the exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine, 
and instantaneously evaporated because of the large heat capacity 
of the flash chamber. The generated water vapor is mixed with 
intake air or the exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine 
and discharged outside. Another example of the conventional methods of treating 
human waste and apparatuses for treating human waste employs 
incineration by electric heat. In this method, an electric heater wire(s) is installed in 
an on-board portable toilet. A paper mat is placed on top of it, 
onto which the bowel is emptied, and then the stool, along with 
the mat, is incinerated. However, the conventional method of treating human waste and 
apparatus for treating human waste described in Japanese 
unexamined patent publication (Tokkai) Hei 2-102778 had a problem 
in that since the flash chamber was placed in the discharge path 
of the exhaust gas, the surface area of this discharge path 
increased, hence the heat of the exhaust gas easily escaped 
outside and the temperature of the flash chamber did not rise 
sufficiently, resulting in a long treatment time of the human waste. Also, this conventional technology had another problem in 
that it was necessary to keep a sufficient amount of water in the  
 
flush tank in order to flush the human waste into the flash 
chamber, and the tank required a significant space. The apparatus which uses electric heat for incineration 
required several kilowatts of power consumption for incineration, 
and therefore the incineration took a long time even when a 
dedicated inverter(s) and/or batteries were used. There were 
other problems as follows: it was not suitable for treating 
urine; and, it could not be used for bowel movements during 
incineration. This invention was carried out by focusing on these 
problems, and the object of this invention is to provide a method 
of treating human waste and an

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating human waste which characteristically 
comprises a heat accumulation process in which the heat of the 

exhaust gas from the internal combustion engine is accumulated 
in a heat accumulator, a drying process in which the human waste 

and the flush water are heated by the heat of said heat 
accumulator, a recovery process in which the water vapor 

generated in the drying process is recovered, and a recirculation 
process in which the water vapor recovered in the recovery 

process is recirculated as the flush water. 
A method as described in Claim 1 wherein, in said drying 
process, the human waste and the flush water are heated in the 

presence of ozone. 
A method as described in Claim 1 or 2 wherein, in said 
drying process, the human waste and the flush water are heated 

in the presence of chlorine dioxide. 
An apparatus for treating human waste which 
characteristically comprises a heat accumulator provided in the 

discharge path of the exhaust gas from the internal combustion 
engine, a drying chamber provided next to said heat accumulator 

and connected downstream from the flush toilet in which the human 
waste and the flush water discharged from the flush toilet is 

heated, a water accumulation chamber connected to said drying 
chamber which recovers the water vapor from the drying chamber, 

and a pump which transports the water from said water 
accumulation chamber to the flush tank for the flush water. 
An apparatus for treating human waste as described in Claim 
4 wherein said apparatus has an agitating device and also has an 

agitation chamber connected to said flush toilet and to said 
drying chamber which mixes the human waste and the flush water 

discharged from said flush toilet and discharges the mixture to 
said drying chamber, a scraper provided in said drying chamber 

which scrapes off the residual human waste stuck inside the 
drying chamber, a suction device which suctions the residual 

 
human waste scraped off from the inside of the drying chamber 

through a suction port provided in said drying chamber, and a 
moving device which moves said scraper and said suction port in 

said drying chamber. 
An apparatus for treating human waste as described in Claim 
4 wherein: said apparatus has a scraper and the scraper has a 

scraper roller, a rotating shaft, one pair of racks, one pair of 
spur gears and a reciprocating motion mechanism; said scraper 

roller is provided in said drying chamber and has a plurality of 
blades which, when rotated, scrape off the residual human waste 

stuck to the bottom surface in said drying chamber; said 
rotating shaft is secured at the center of said scraper roller; 

said one pair of racks is secured on either side of the inside 
of said drying chamber; said one pair of spur gears is secured 

on either end of said rotating shaft and engaged with said racks; 
and, said reciprocating motion mechanism supports said rotating 

shaft such that it can rotate, and power-drives said rotating 
shaft reciprocally in said drying chamber.
