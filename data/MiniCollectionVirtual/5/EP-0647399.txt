containing as an active ingredient a 3-substituted 

pyrazole derivative represented by the general formula 
(I): 


(wherein the substituents are as defined in the description 
of the specification) in which the 50% particle size 

and 90% particle size in cumulative particle size 
distribution of particles of the active ingredient are 

less than 1 µm and less than 2 µm, respectively, and 
which is harmless to useful crops and is equal to an 

emulsifiable concentrate in herbicidal effect; and a 
process for producing said pesticidal aqueous suspension 

concentrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pesticidal
aqueous suspension concentrate containing as an active
ingredient a 3-substituted pyrazole derivative
represented by the general formula (I):

[wherein R is
-Y1R3
(wherein R3 is a C1-C6 alkyl group, a C1-C6 haloalkyl
group, a C2-C6 alkenyl group or a C2-C6 alkynyl group, and
Y1 is -O- or -S-),
-Y2CH(R4)CO-OR5
(wherein R4 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-C6 alkyl group, R5
is a hydrogen atom, a C1-C6 alkyl group, a C1-C6 haloalkyl
group, a C2-C6 alkenyl group or a C2-C6 alkynyl group, and
Y2 is -O-, -S- or -NH-). 
-COOCH(R4)CO-Y1R5
(wherein R4, R5 and Y1 are as defined above), or
-COOR6
(wherein R6 is a C1-C6 alkyl group, a C1-C6 haloalkyl
group, a C2-C6 alkenyl group or a C2-C6 alkynyl group), R1
is a C1-C6 alkyl group, R2 is a hydrogen atom, a C1-C6
alkyl group or a C1-C6 haloalkyl group, X1 and X2, which
may be the same or different, are halogen atoms, Y is
-O-, -S-, -SO- or -SO2-, and n is zero or 1], the 50%
particle size and 90% particle size in cumulative
particle size distribution of particles of the active
ingredient being 1 µm or less and 2 µm or less, respectively;
and a process for producing said pesticidal
aqueous suspension concentrate.The 3-substituted phenylpyrazole derivative of
the general formula (I) is a compound described in
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 3-163063 and
4-211065. As a herbicide, said derivative has an
excellent herbicidal activity against all of herbaceous
weeds which are harmful to upland farming. Particularly
when applied for wheat (barley, oats or rye) cropping,
said derivative exhibits a marked herbicidal effect on
typical weeds such as cleavers (Galiumaparine), chickweed
(Stellariamedia), birdseye speedwell (Veronicapersica),
sentless chamonile (Matricariainodora), purple 
deadnettle (Lamiumpurpureum), henbit (Lamiumamplexicaule),
shepherd's purse (Capsellabursapastoris),
marsh yelloweress (Rorippaislandica), sticky
chickweed (Cerastiumviscosum), common lambsquarters
(Chenopodiumalbum), tufted knotweed (Polygonumlongisetum),
prostrate knotweed (Polygonumaviculare),
etc.Post-emergence herbicides have been generally
used in the form of emulsifiable concentrates, wettable
powders, suspension concentrates, etc. In particular,
the emulsifiable concentrates have a marked herbicidal
effect.However, blending of an organic solvent is
indispensable for preparing the emulsifiable concentrate,
so that the emulsifiable concentrates have defects such
as undesirable effects on the environment and harmfulness
to users.
