<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for the automatic detection of dangerous objects in the left and right hand sides of a vehicle and in its back space which includes ultrasound transmitters (4) activated by generators (6) with a defined angle of radiation emitting ultrasound waves continuously, pulsed or modulated. Ultrasound receivers (14) are connected to an analyser for determination of intensity, speed of change, Doppler frequency change and the angle of fall of the received signal which determines the road situation. Dangerous objects are detected to the left and right of the driver and an alarm or signal is then given to the driver.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE ALARM SYSTEMFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the field of technical vision forobjects detection, and, more particularly to systems for providing an alarmwhen a vehicle is present in the dead zone of driver's view (Fig. 1) at theleft or right side of the vehicle, especially when the driver tries to move toone side or the other, as when changing lanes.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the present invention, there is provided an apparatusfor the automatic detection of dangerous objects in the left and right sidesof vehicle and in its back space comprising: ultrasound transmitters (4)activated by generators (6) with defined angle of radiation emittingultrasound waves continuously or pulsed or modulated; ultrasound receivers(14) connected to an analog or digital analyzer for determination ofintensity, speed of change, Doppler's frequency change and angle of fallof the received signal that determines road situation; amplifiers (16), signalanalyzer (18) includes time and frequency discriminators for speed anddistance determination, received returned signal from amplifiers andstandard signal from generator, control and signal from amplifiers andstandard signal from generator, control and calculation unit with conditioninputs like vehicle speed (10) and turn signal (12), commutation unit, alarm 

or display unit for communication with driver, communication to other vehicle systems that detects dangerous objects presence into the pre-definedarea limited by lines of driver's direct view, borders of left and rightadjacent lines of traffic and predetermined distance back and providesalarm or signalization to vehicle driver.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe invention is herein described, by way of example only, withreference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:Fig. 1 contains basic drawing of driver's field of view where αl isa front view, α2 - view through left side mirror, α3 - view through rightside mirror, α4 - panorama mirror view, βl and β2 angles defining "deadarea" of drivers view. R and L are areas where detection of anothervehicle is needed. Those areas includes two lines (in the left and rightsides) limited by αl angle lines forward and same distance back fromvehicle (about 10-15 meters). Dashed line shows dangerous object mayoccur in those areas.Fig. 2 shows functional division of dangerous places on the left andright sides. Distance A is comparable with vehicle length. Distance B isadditional length that dangerous object may arrive from.

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An apparatus for the automatic detection of dangerous objects in
the left and right sides of vehicle and in its back space comprising:
ultrasound transmitters (4) activated by generators (6) with defined angle
of radiation emitting ultrasound waves continuously or pulsed or
modulated; ultrasound receivers (14) connected to an analog or digital
analyzer for determination of intensity, speed of change, Doppler's
frequency change and angle of fall of the received signal that determines
road situation; amplifiers (16), signal analyzer (18) includes time and
frequency discriminators for speed and distance determination, received
returned signal from amplifiers and standard signal from generator, control
and signal from amplifiers and standard signal from generator, control and
calculation unit with condition inputs like vehicle speed (10) and turn
signal (12), commutation unit, alarm or display unit for communication
with driver, communication to other vehicle systems that detects dangerous
objects presence into the pre-defined area limited by lines of driver's direct
view, borders of left and right adjacent lines of traffic and predetermined
distance back and provides alarm or signalization to vehicle driver.
2. An apparatus according to claim 1 where emitted and received
signal is a sound, ultrasound or electromagnetic radiation. 


 3. An apparatus according to claim 1 installed on the external left
and/or right side of vehicle.
4. An apparatus according to claim 1 installed on the top part of
vehicle.
5. An apparatus according to claim 1 includes for easy and simple
installation a non wire communication channel among different parts of
claimed apparatus.
6. An apparatus according to claim 1 with addition for
individualizing of signals for each vehicle prevent vehicles signals
interference.
