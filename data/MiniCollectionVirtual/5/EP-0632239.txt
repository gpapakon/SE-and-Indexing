<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hot gas passage for installation in a boiler casing between its combustion chamber and the outlet-side closing wall of the water-carrying casing interior, consisting of a pocket of thin-walled, metallic material with a cross-section substantially in the form of an elongated hole, the length and height of which pocket are a multiple of its width. To solve the object of improving a hot gas passage or a hot gas passage pocket of the generic type in a simple way such that the thinnest sheet metal possible can be used for the water-side wall while the means for specifically influencing the heat transfer are at the same time to serve as supporting means for pressure reinforcement of the large-area sidewalls of the pocket, the hot gas passage according to the invention is constructed in such a way that the entire inner surface (F) of the pocket (5) is lined with an inner shell (6) conformed in shape and made of a material different from the material of the outer wall (7), the inner shell (6) being in direct contact, only in partial regions, with the outer wall (7) and the two sidewalls of the inner shell (6) being supported against one another likewise only in partial regions.

<CLAIMS>
A heating gas flue for assembly into a boiler housing (1) between the combustion 
chamber (2) and the closure wall (3) of the water-carrying housing interior (4) provided 

on the discharge side, comprising a pocket (5) of thin-walled, metallic material of 
substantially oblong-
hole-type cross-section, the length (L) and height (H) of which 
correspond to a multiple of their width (B),
 
characterized in that provided on the whole of the inner face (F) of the pocket (5) is a 

shape-conforming inner shell (6) made of a material differing from the material of the 
outer wall (7) of the pocket (5), with the inner shell (6) only in partial areas (TB) being 

in direct contact with the outer wall (7) of the pocket (5) and the two side walls of the 
inner shell (6) also in partial areas (TB
1
) only being supported one against the other. 
A heating gas flue according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the inner shell (6) is formed of two parts (6') which in cross-section 

are of identical shape and in the central longitudinal plane (E) of the pocket (5) are in 
abutting relationship. 
A heating gas flue according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the partial areas 
(TB) are formed by inwardly or outwardly directed profiles (8) provided on the outer 

wall (7) and/or the inner shell (6). 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
supporting partial areas (TB
1
) of the side walls of the inner shell (6) are formed of 
longitudinal fins (10) extending in parallel to the flow direction (DR).  

 
A heating gas flue according to claim 4, characterized in that additional longitudinal 
fins (10') are arranged in parallel between the longitudinal fins (10), with the longitudinal 

fins (10') exempted from counters-fins of the other side terminating in the interior (11) 
of the pocket (5). 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the two 
parts (6') of identical shape are formed as extruded profiles. 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the two 
parts (6') are formed of plate blanks (12) and that the longitudinal fins (10,10') of folds 

of the plate blanks are formed thereon. 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
arranged on the opening (13) ofthe pocket (5) on the in-flow side is a one-shelled 

combustion chamber connecting pocket (14) of a corresponding outer cross-section and 
that the same is provided, on the pocket side, with a circumferential offset (15) 

overlapping the inner shell (6) on the opening rim (16) exempted from longitudinal fins 
(10,10'). 
A heating gas flue according to claim 8, characterized in that the offset (15) is formed 
of two steps (15',15"), with the first step (15') being in internal abutment with the 

opening rim of the outer wall (7), and the second step (15") overlapping the inner shell 
(6). 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the end 
rims (9) of the pocket (5) are of a semicircular rounding.  

 
A heating gas flue according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the 
inner shell (6), on the discharge side, protrudes beyond the outer wall (7) of the pocket 

(5).
