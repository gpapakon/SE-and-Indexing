<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing mats of continuous glass yarns, at least part of the said yarns being coated with a non-aqueous mixture capable of reacting under actinic radiation. The mats obtained have sufficient homogeneous cohesion throughout their thickness, this cohesion being important for obtaining composites having good mechanical properties using the said mats.

Method for producing a mat formed of a lap
of continuous glass threads coming from one or

more dies, according to which there are drawn,
from the apertures of each die, a plurality of

molten glass streams in the form of laps with
continuous filaments, the filaments are coated

with a non-aqueous lubricant capable of reacting
under the effect of an actinic radiation and then

the filaments are gathered together into at least
one thread, each thread being entrained

mechanically by a system of drawing provided with
a member ensuring the projection and distribution

of the thread onto a collecting surface or onto a
conveyor which is in movement in a direction which

is transverse in relation to the direction of the
threads being projected, characterised in that a

non-aqueous binder capable of reacting under the
effect of actinic radiation is projected onto the

glass threads and in that the glass threads are
subjected, after distribution on the conveyor, to

the effect of one or several actinic radiations.
Process according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the lubricant which is used
is one which is cross-linkable under the effect of 

an ultraviolet radiation and in that the glass
threads are subjected to at least one ultraviolet

radiation.
Process according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the lubricant which is used

is a lubricant which is cross-linkable under the
effect of an infrared radiation and in that the

glass threads are subjected to at least one
infrared radiation.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the binder which is

used is one which is cross-linkable under the
effect of ultraviolet radiation and in that the

glass threads are subjected to at least one
ultraviolet radiation.
Process according to any one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the binder used is a

binder which is cross-linkable under the action of
infrared radiation and in that the glass threads

are subjected to at least one infrared radiation.
Process according to Claim 5,

characterised in that the binder is in the form of
powder of thermoplastic or thermosettable

polymers. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the glass threads are

subjected to a first deposition of binder and to a
first irradiation in the vicinity of the first

dies and then to a second deposition of binder and
to a second irradiation over the whole thereof at

the output from the last dies.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that each deposition of binder is

preceded and/or followed by calendering and/or
stitching prior to submission to an actinic

radiation.
