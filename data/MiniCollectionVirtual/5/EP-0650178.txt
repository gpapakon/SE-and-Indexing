<ABSTRACT>
This is an interface (1) intended to be interposed between a differential switch and at least one auxiliary unit for triggering changeover switching and/or signalling. It comprises a first lever (30) provided with an element (10) for linking to the mechanism of the auxiliary unit, and a second lever (20), articulated onto the first lever (30), and engaged, on the one hand, with a second connecting rod (16) controlled by the contact carrier shaft of the said differential switch and, on the other hand, with a third link rod (50, 60) controlling the triggering of the said differential switch. When the said first link rod (20, 30) is moved under the control of the said second link rod (16), it draws along the said linking element (10) without acting on the third link rod (50, 60). When it is moved under the control of the said linking element, it draws the said third link rod along.

An interface for adaptation to a multipolar differential switch
of electrical auxiliary units which are intended to implement triggering,

switching and/or signalling functions, said interface being adapted to be
disposed adjacent to and coupled to on the one hand said differential

switch and on the other hand an auxiliary unit, said interface being
characterised in that its mechanism comprises:


a first member (10) connected to the mechanism of said auxiliary
unit,
a second member (11) for causing triggering of the differential
switch, and
a third member (16) controlled by the contact-carrying shaft of
the differential switch;

   that said mechanism is adapted on the one hand to transmit a
triggering order of the differential switch to the interface, the

displacement of said third member causing that of said first member, said

second member remaining immobile, and on the other hand to transmit a
triggering order of the interface to the differential switch, the

displacement of said first member causing that of said second member,
said third member remaining immobile; and

   that that one of the devices which emits a triggering order
supplies the interface with the mechanical energy necessary for

triggering of the other device.
An interface according to claim 1 characterised in that it
comprises a first linkage including:


a first lever (30) mounted pivotably about a fixed axis (36) and
provided with a connecting member (10) for connection to the mechanism of

said auxiliary unit (3), and
a second lever (20) pivotably connected to said first lever (30)
and in engagement on the one hand with a second linkage (16) controlled

by a contact-carrying shaft of said differential switch (2) and on the
other hand with a third linkage (50, 60) controlling a mechanism for

triggering of said differential switch; and
 
   that when said first linkage (20, 30) moves under the control of

said second linkage (16) it entrains said connecting member (10) without
acting on said third linkage (50, 60) and when it moves under the control

of said connecting member it entrains said third linkage.
An interface according to claim 2 characterised in that a link
(50) of the third linkage is mounted pivotably on said second lever (20),

the axis (25) of said pivotal mounting being aligned with the axis (36)
of pivotal movement of said first lever (30) when said interface is in

its rest position corresponding to the closed position of the
differential switch.
An interface according to claim 3 characterised in that said
second lever (20) is adapted to come into a position of abutment against

said first lever (30) so that when said second lever moves under the
control of said second linkage (16) said two levers pivot together about

the axis (36) of pivotal movement of said first lever so that, the
pivotal mounting (25) of the link (50) of the third linkage (50, 60) to

said second lever being aligned with said axis (36) of said first lever,
no action is applied to said third linkage.
An interface according to any one of claims 2 to 4
characterised in that when said first lever (30) moves under the control

of said connecting member (10) said second lever (20) which is retained
at the location of its connection to said second linkage (16) pivots with

respect to said first lever and thereby entrains said third linkage (50,
60).
An interface according to any one of claims 2 to 5
characterised in that said second lever (20) is provided at one of its

ends with an axis member (21) in engagement with a corresponding oblong
housing (17) provided on an end of a link (16) of the second linkage, said

link pivoting at the location of its other end under the control of the
contact-carrying shaft of the differential switch (2). 
An interface according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it is associated with at least one supplementary

auxiliary unit (4) which is disposed adjacent to and which is coupled to
said auxiliary unit (3) so as to transmit to said supplementary auxiliary

unit mechanical triggering energy provided by said auxiliary unit and
vice-versa.
An interface according to any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that it is provided with an electrical signalling device

(79) comprising a switching means (76) which is pilot-controlled by a
lever (70) controlled by said third member (16) in such a way that an

incomplete movement of the contact-carrying shaft is not sufficient to
cause the change in state of said switching means.
