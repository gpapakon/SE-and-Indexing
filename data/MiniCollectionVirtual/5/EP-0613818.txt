<ABSTRACT>
An annular element 4 slides along the vertical fitting part 2 of the carriage device. This element 4 includes two annular parts 5, 6 of different diameters which slide in a leaktight way along cylindrical walls 8, 9 of the fitting part 2. A chamber 13, defined by the annular element 4 and the fitting part 2, is supplied with incompressible fluid, through a duct 14, by a screw pump. The control, by the screw of the pump, of the feed to the chamber 13 provides clamping of the annular element 4 against an internal shoulder of a bore. The clamping, on the lower part 5 of the annular element 4, of a castellated nut 24 makes it possible to wedge the element 4 while releasing the pressure of the fluid. The device makes it possible to immobilise the male fitting part of the device for carriage of the store, within the bore of the carrier structure of the aeroplane, by clamping of a nut without the necessity to use large-sized spanners.

Clamping system for attaching carrying means 
under aircraft, comprising a central vertical connector 

(2) for engaging in a bore of a structure of the 
aeroplane and an annular element (4) designed to move 

along the central connector (2) in order to clamp a 
support member, characterized in that the clamping system 

is hydraulic, the said annular element (4) defining, with 
the external wall of the central connector (2), a 

leaktight thrust chamber (13) supplied selectively with 
incompressible fluid, the said annular element (4) 

constituting a piston the clamping of which is brought 
about by the pressure of the fluid. 
Clamping system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the said thrust chaser (13) is 

supplied with fluid by means of a screw pump incorporated 
in the carrying means (1). 
Clamping system according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the said screw pump comprises, in 

a bore (16) of the carrying means (1) containing 
incompressible fluid, a piston (18) connected to a screw 

(17) which cooperates with the tapped internal wall of 
the said bore (16), the latter communicating with the 

said thrust chamber (13) through at least one duct (14, 
14') so that the pressure in the said thrust chamber (13) 

is increased by action on the said screw (17). 
Clamping system according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the portion of the said bore (16) 

which is situated in front of the piston (18) is  
 

connected to a fluid filling valve (23). 
Clamping system according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, 
characterized in that the differences of the cross-sections 

of the pistons (4, 18) and the pitch of the 
thread of the screw are calculated so that a powerful 

lifting action is applied to the annular element (4) with 
only a low torque on the screw (17). 
Clamping system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the annular 

element (4) has portions (5, 6) with two different 
diameters each cooperating with the wall of the central 

bore (2) by means of a seal (10, 11). 
Clamping system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises a 

nut (24) the screwing-on of which holds the annular 
element (4) in the clamping position after the fluid 

pressure in the thrust chamber (13) has been released.
