<CLAIMS>
Casing for a watch, comprising a shell (2),
face (4) and cover glass (5), all of which are produced

from plastic, characterized in that the face (4) has a
supporting function for the cover glass (5) and the

shell (2), extends as far as the wrist-strap fastening
(14), and permits optionally arrangeable positionings

(13, 10) for the shell (2) and cover glass (5), and in
that differently shaped cover glasses (5) and

differently shaped shells (2) are thus fastened
optionally by integral and sealed connections, i.e.

ones produced by adhesive bonding or welding,
positioned on opposite sides of the face (4).
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the integral connection between the cover glass

and the face produces a direct connection (12, 13) to
the top surface (20), this connection directly and

exclusively positioning and fastening the cover glass
on the face.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the face is fastened directly on the shell.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the extent of the face corresponds at least to the

extent of the cover glass.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in comparison with its extent (45), the face has

an essentially constant and small thickness (44).
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the top surface of the face is curved essentially

outwards. 
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cover glass (47) is only in contact with the

face (35) via a bearing surface (39).
Casing according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the integral connection provided is a weld

connection.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cover glass is only subjected to forces which

are caused by the inherent gravitational force.
Method of producing a casing according to Claim
1, characterized in that the cover glass is positioned

on the face by a tool (41) and is then secured directly
on the top surface (40) of the face.
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the face is positioned on the shell (34) by a tool

(41) and is then secured directly on the shell.
