<ABSTRACT>
Various arrangements are proposed for coupling films 
to a leader. A hole is formed in one of the films and the 

leader to receive a tab which is formed on the other. 
These arrangements allow stable coupling of the films to 

the leader and easy uncoupling. They eliminate the use of 
splice tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for coupling
undeveloped films to a leader according to the
precharacterizing portion of claim 1.A corresponding conventional coupling arrangement in which a
film is connected to a leader via a resilient tongue which is
directed into a direction opposite to a film-transport
direction, is known from US PS 4 110 774.When developing undeveloped films (hereinafter simply
referred to as "films") in an automatic film developing
machine of a type that utilizes leaders to guide films, the
front ends of films F are connected to a leader L after
pulling them out of patrones P as shown in Fig. 27. The
films F are sent to the film developing unit, led by the
leader.The leader L is formed of a flexible synthetic resin
sheet. Along its longitudinal center are formed a
plurality of holes a arranged at equal intervals and
adapted to engage a feed sprocket provided in the film
developing unit.Such an automatic film developing machine is
ordinarily provided with a film guide. If films are
detached from the film guide while being fed, their
surfaces may be damaged due to contact with the film guide.
Thus, it is necessary to couple films reliably to the
leader with high positional accuracy.If a film F should get off the leader L while
developing, it will be stuck in the treating solution. It
is extremely troublesome to take out such a stuck film. If 
taken out carelessly, the film F may be exposed to light.
Thus, films F have to be rigidly coupled to leaders L.For this purpose, films F were heretofore connected
to a leader F by means of splicing tapes T as shown in Fig.
27.In order to connect films to a leader using splicing
tapes T with high positional accuracy, the leader has to be
placed on a special-purpose workbench. It is necessary to
keep off oil contents and dust from the adhesive surface of
the splicing tapes T. Thus, a taping job tends to be very
troublesome. In order to prevent films F from getting off
the leader while being fed, it is necessary to use splicing
tapes with high bond strength. It is difficult to peel off
such tapes after developing films F. Such tapes are not
recyclable and thus are uneconomical.It is an object of this invention to provide an
arrangement for coupling films to a leader which is free of
these problems, which makes it possible to couple film to
a leader without using a special-purpose workbench and with
high positional accuracy and with which films can be easily
coupled to and detached from the leader.In order to attain this object, according

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for coupling a film (3) to a leader (1) for guiding the film in an automatic film developing machine, said arrangement
comprising an engaging hole means (5) formed in the film (3) at a front end

thereof, and an engaging means provided on the leader (1) at a rear end thereof
with respect to the feed direction of the leader (1) so as to be engageable in said

engaging hole means (5) 
characterized in that
, said engaging means is formed
as an engaging tab means (8,41,51,61,71,84) extending toward the feed direction

of the leader (1).
A arrangement for coupling a film (3) to a leader (1) as claimed in claim 1 wherein
the film (3) has at the front end thereof a coupling portion narrower than the film

(3), wherein said engaging hole means (5) is formed in said coupling portion,
wherein the leader (1) is formed with an insertion hole (6) for inserting said

coupling portion, and wherein said engaging tab means (8) is formed along the

rear end of said insertion hole (6) so as to be engageable in said engaging hole
means (5).
An arrangement for coupling a film (3) to a leader (1) as claimed in claim 2,
wherein the leader (1) is formed with a cut-out (7) at the rear of said insertion hole

(6), said cut-out (7) having a width substantially equal to the width of said coupling
portion, and wherein the film (3) has shoulder portions (9) on both sides of front

end thereof, said shoulder portions (9) being engageable with the rear side of the
leader (1) on both sides of said cut-out (7).
An arrangement four coupling a film (3) to a leader (1) as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said leader (1) is formed with a window (42) at a position opposite to said

engaging tab means (41) provided on said leader (1), wherein a pair of cuts (43)
are formed so as to extend in the feed direction of the leader from the front edge 

of said window (42), and wherein a pair of tab portions (45) are formed on the
outer sides of said respective cuts (43) so as to engage both sides of the front

end of said engaging tab means (41).

direction of the leader (1) and spaced apart from each other by a distance shorter

than the width of the film (3), and front and rear cuts (75,74) extending obliquely
from the front ends and rear ends of said center cuts (73), respectively, and

wherein a pair of engaging tabs (71) are formed between said front and rear cuts
(75,74) so as to be engageable in said engaging holes (72).
