<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor wafer, to form an oxide film, is oxidized in 
a heat treatment furnace and is annealed if necessary . When 

said wafer is taken out of said heat treatment furnace, an 
ambient gas containing water vapor is fed into said heat 

treatment furnace. The gap linear velocity of the ambient gas 
is set to 200 cm/min or more. If the ambient gas used at the 

time when the wafer is taken out of the furnace is a dry gas 
without water vapor, then an additional heat treatment is carried 

out using a hydrogen containing atmosphere at low temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No. 5-192726 filed on July 6, 1993 which is incorporated 
herein by reference. This invention relates to a method of oxidizing a semiconductor 
wafer, and more precisely to a method of oxidizing a 
semiconductor wafer which allows formation of a high-quality 
oxide film on the semiconductor wafer with good reproducibility 
and little fluctuation in quality. When manufacturing a semiconductor device, a process is 
required in which a semiconductor oxide film is formed on the 
semiconductor wafer by oxidizing the semiconductor wafer. The 
most common way to do this is to oxidize the silicon wafer to 
form a silicon oxide film. The thermal oxidation method is  
 
generally adopted as the method of thermal oxidation in which the 
semiconductor wafer (hereafter referred to as "wafer") is 
thermally oxidized to form a semiconductor oxide film (hereafter 
referred to as "oxide film"). In the thermal oxidation method, 
the wafer is placed in a quartz tube in a vertical- or horizontal-type 
heat treatment furnace. While an oxidizing source such 
as oxygen and water vapor is fed into the quartz tube, the wafer 
is heated up to approximately 1000°C and oxidized. The oxide film thus obtained by thermal oxidation has various 
electrical charges due to interface-states, traps in the film, 
etc. These charges are known to cause the surface potential of 
the semiconductor to vary and cause serious problems in performance 
(yield, reliability, etc.) of semiconductor integrated 
circuits prepared from this wafer. Because of this, various 
researches have been carried out to study the charges in oxide 
films (see IEEE. Transaction on Electron Devices, Vol. ed-27, No. 
3, Mar., 1980, pp. 606-608). Another research has also shown that the charge density 
decreases as the oxidation temperature rises, and that the charge 
density is further reduced when annealing is carried out in an  
 
inert gas such as argon and nitrogen (see J. Electrochem. Soc.: 
Solid State Science, Mar., 1967, pp. 266-273 for details). Subsequent detailed research has revealed that after the 
oxidation heat treatment, the charge density in the oxide film 
increases by the presence of dry oxygen in the ambient inert gas 
during annealing (see J. Electrochem. Soc. : Solid State 
Science, Mar., Sep., 1971, pp. 1463-1468 for details). When forming the oxide film on the wafer, particularly when 
the horizontal type heat treatment furnace is used for the 
oxidation heat treatment, the
