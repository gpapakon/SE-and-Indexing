<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has a housing (1), a mounting bracket (3) and a coupling (4) to connect the housing adjustably with the bracket (3). The coupling (4) has a first part (10) secured to the housing (1), a second part (20) fixed to the bracket (3) and a blocking device (5), the first and the second parts (10, 20) being nested and coupled. The blocking device (5) may have a blocking member (12, 14) coupled to one of the parts (10, 20) and a seat (21, 22) therefor in the other of the parts (10, 20). The coupling (4) allows for rotating the housing (1) from its adjusted position and to bring it back into its original position without the need to adjust it again.

<DESCRIPTION>
LuminaireThe invention relates to a luminaire comprising: a housing with means for accommodating an electric lamp therein; a mounting bracket for fastening to a support; a coupling which connects the housing adjustably to the mounting bracket.Such a luminaire is known from US 5,353,211. In the known luminaire, the coupling consists of a threaded bolt which is screwed into a threaded hole in the housing. Before the threaded bolt is completely tightened, the bolt forms a horizontal shaft about which the housing can be pivoted upwards or downwards so as to illuminate the desired field by means of the luminaire. Once the correct position of the housing has been found, the latter is fixed in that the bolt is tightened.Luminaires are often used in locations where they are accessible with difficulty, often from one side only, for example from the rear. This is the case, for example, when a luminaire is used for lighting, for example, a sports ground and is mounted against a framework at the top of a mast or at the edge of a roof, for example the edge of the roof of a spectator stand. It may be necessary in that case to loose the coupling and rotate the housing in the case of maintenance of the luminaire, for example for cleaning a reflector in the luminaire or a transparent plate which closes off the housing, or for replacing a lamp. In a luminaire of the known kind, the housing must be accurately realigned when the maintenance work has been completed so as to achieve the original adjustment again. This is time-consuming and requires craftsmanship. The necessity of a repeated alignment is accordingly a major disadvantage of the known luminaire.The adjustment of the housing with respect to the mounting bracket, with the object of throwing the light beam formed by the luminaire in the desired direction, should not be confused with the positioning of an electric lamp in the housing of the luminaire so as to give this lamp the correct position relative to a reflector in the housing and to create a light beam of the desired shape, i.e. with the desired light distribution. The essence of the luminaire described in the cited US 5,353,211 indeed lies in this adjustment of 

the shape of the light beam.It is an object of the invention to provide a luminaire of the kind described in the opening paragraph which is of a simple construction and which renders it possible to replicate as it were automatically a once found adjustment of the housing with reference to the mounting bracket after a rotation of the

CLAIMS:
1. A luminaire comprising: a housing (1) with means (2) for accommodating an electric lamp Is therein; a mounting bracket (3) for fastening to a support; a coupling (4) which connects the housing (1) adjustably to the mounting bracket (3), characterized in that the coupling (4) comprises a first part (10) which is fixedly connected to the housing (1) and a second part (20) located in or around and coupled to the first part and fastened to the mounting bracket (3), the first (10) and the second part (20) being rotatable relative to one another, and the coupling (4) having a blocking device (5) with an operational position from which it can be released, and with release positions, which blocking device (5) in its operational position locks the first (10) and the second part (20) in a previously defined rotational position.
2. A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the blocking device (5) comprises a resilient blocking element (11) and a seat (21) cooperating therewith.
3. A luminaire as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the resilient blocking element (11) can be removed from the seat (21) in that the first (10) and the second part (20) of the coupling (4) are rotated relative to one another.
4. A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the blocking device (5) comprises a rigid blocking element (12) and a seat (22) cooperating therewith, into which seat the blocking element (12) can be rotated inwards.
5. A luminaire as claimed in claim 2 and 4, characterized in that the blocking device (5) comprises a first, resilient blocking element (11) and a first seat (21) cooperating therewith, and a second, rigid blocking element (12) and a second seat (22) cooperating therewith, into which second seat (22) the blocking element (12) can be rotated 


inwards.
6. A luminaire as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the first, resilient blocking element (11) can be removed from the seat (21) in that the first (10) and the second part (20) of the coupling (4) are rotated relative to one another.
7. A luminaire as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the first part (10) of the coupling (4) surrounds the second part (20).
8. A luminaire as claimed in claim 1 or 7, characterized in that the second part (20) of the coupling (4) is connected to the mounting bracket (3) by means of one threaded bolt (23).
9. A luminaire as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that the blocking device (5) comprises a blocking element (11, 12) connected to the first part (10) of the coupling (4) and a mating seat (21, 22) in the second part (20) of the coupling (4).
