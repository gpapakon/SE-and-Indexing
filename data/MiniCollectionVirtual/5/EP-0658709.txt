<ABSTRACT>
Pulley, in particular for a continuously variable transmission, provided 
with a set of discs on a pulley shaft, at least one disc being axially 

movable, as well as one or more bearings for accommodating the pulley 
with respect to a supporting element, in particular a transmission 

housing. One or more of said bearings are mounted on a disc of the 
pulley.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pulley as defined by the features of the preamble 
of claim 1 and 5, respectively, which 
are known from JP-A 3 168 452 and EP-A 389030, respectively. A pulley of the type disclosed in JP-A 3 168 452 is widely used 
in continuously variable transmissions. Transmissions of this type are 
used, inter alia, in motor vehicles. In the case of this known pulley. 
the pulley shaft extends axially beyond the discs, so that mountings for 
one or both bearings can be mounted at this location to accommodate the 
pulley with respect to a supporting element, for example a transmission 
housing. For one or both bearings, a disc can also be provided with an 
axial protrusion which provides a mounting for said bearing. Both the 
protruding pulley shaft and the axial protrusion on the pulley shaft 
demand an appreciable installation space, especially in the axial 
direction. For many applications, such as, for example, for motor 
vehicles, such an installation space is not available, or the 
installation space is preferably kept as restricted as possible. The aim of the invention is to provide a compact pulley requiring a 
limited axial installation space. To this end, the pulley according to 
the invention is 
defined by the features of claim 1 and 5, respectively. According to a further development of the invention, the disc is 
connected to one end of the pulley shaft and the bearing is mounted 
axially on the disc beyond the end of the pulley shaft. In this way, the 
bearing can be virtually completely enclosed by the disc, so that no 
length or only a very small length is required for installation. The pulley shaft/disc assembly can comprise a recess for accommodating a  
 
stub axle radially inwards from the bearing, which stub axle, in turn, 
can be accommodated in the transmission housing. The interface between 
the bearing and the supporting element, in particular the transmission 
housing, offers a direct and internal mounting which requires a very 
short length for installation. The invention, together with the further advantages thereof, will be 
explained in more detail with reference to a drawing. In the drawing: 
Figure 1 shows a continuously variable transmission provided with a 
pulley according to the prior art, Figure 2a shows a diagrammatic first embodiment of the pulley according 
to the invention, and Figure 2b shows a diagrammatic second embodiment of the pulley according 
to the invention. Figure 1 shows, diagrammatically, part of a continuously variable 
transmission 1

<CLAIMS>
Pulley, in particular for a continuously variable 
transmission, provided with a set of discs (32, 33) on a 

pulley shaft (31), at least one disc (32) being axially 
movable by means of displacement means, and with at 

least one bearing (35) to accommodate the pulley with 
respect to a supporting element, in particular a transmission 

housing, said one bearing being mounted on another 
disc (33), 
characterised in that
said one bearing (35) is mounted in a recess provided 
in said another disc (33) in such a way that said one 

bearing is at least partially enclosed in the axial direction 
by said another disc
 
or 
said one bearing (35) is mounted on a radially outer 
part of said another disc (33) in such a way that said 

one bearing at least partially encloses said another 
disc in its axial direction. 
Pulley according to Claim 1, wherein said another 
disc (33) is connected to one end of said pulley shaft 

(31) and said one bearing (35) is mounted axially beyond 
the end of the pulley shaft. 
Pulley according to Claim 2, wherein said assembly of 
said pulley shaft and said another disc comprises a recess 

(38) to accommodate as said supporting element a 
stub axle (36) radially inwards from said one bearing 

(35). 
Pulley according to Claim 3, wherein said stub axle 
(36) is fixed to a transmission housing.  

 
Pulley, in particular for a continuously variable 
transmission, provided with a set of discs (42, 43) on a 

pulley shaft (41), at least one disc (43) being axially 
movable by means of displacement means, and with at 

least one bearing (54) to accommodate the pulley with 
respect to a supporting element, in particular a transmission 

housing, said one bearing being mounted on said 
displacement means,
characterised in that
 
said one bearing (54) is mounted between said displacement 

means and said supporting element in such a way 

that said one bearing is at least partially enclosed 
in the axial direction by said displacement means or 
that said one bearing (54) at least partially encloses 
said displacement means in its axial direction. 
Pulley according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein said one bearing (35; 54) is a radial bearing.
