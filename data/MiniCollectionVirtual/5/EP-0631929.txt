<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to aircraft landing gear, of the sideways retracting type, and to tandem wheels. In accordance with the invention, the leg (50) is formed by a rigid casing (10) having the general shape of a T, exhibiting a plane of symmetry thereof (P), and by two wheel-carrying bogeys (12.1, 12.2) articulated at the end of the casing, these two bogey beams extending on either side of the abovementioned plane of symmetry (P). Each bogey beam (12.1, 12.2) is further linked to the rigid casing (10) by an associated damper (15.1, 15.2), preferably with a rocker (20) and control rod (21) system allowing the rear wheel to be retracted lower during the retraction of the gear.
