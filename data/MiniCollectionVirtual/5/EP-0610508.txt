<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting misfire by utilizing the variation of rotation of a 
crankshaft, capable of detecting the occurrence of misfire accurately with the 

influence of a detection error eliminated which is ascribed to a structural error 
of a crank angle sensor used in the detection of variation of rotation of the 

crankshaft. When a processor receives pulses sequentially from a crank angle 
sensor, it detects (S2) the length of a period of time between the entry of the 

detection operation into a region of angle of rotation of crankshaft concerning 
a cylinder corresponding to the two pulses and the departure of the same 

operation from the same region. An angular acceleration Dωn of the crankshaft 
is calculated (S3, S4) by using a correction factor which is determined 

on the basis of this detected length of period of time and the length of period 
of time which is free from an error of operation of the sensor and determined 

by dividing the time required for one turn of the crankshaft by the number of 
the cylinders. When a calculated value Dωn is smaller than a judgement value, 

the occurrence of misfire is detected (S5-S7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
detecting misfire by the fluctuation in crankshaft 
rotation and more particularly, to a method for 
detecting misfire in which the occurrence of misfire 
can be detected exactly by eliminating the detection 
error in detecting the fluctuation in crankshaft 
rotation which detection error is caused by the error 
in the construction of a crank angle sensor. If a misfire condition, in which combustion in a 
cylinder is not performed properly, occurs in the 
operation of an internal combustion engine due to the 
failure of fuel injector or the like, the exhaust gas 
characteristic or the like of the internal combustion 
engine is deteriorated. To combat this problem, the 
information corresponding to the number of revolutions 
or rotation speed is calculated on the basis of the 
period of each predetermined crank angle corresponding 
to each cylinder of an engine, and the misfire 
condition of engine is detected on the basis of the 
change amount or change rate of this information, as 
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. H2-49955, etc. According to Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication No. H2-49955, if misfire is  
 
detected on the basis of the deviation of the 
rotational angular velocity of the internal combustion 
engine from the rotational angular velocity before one 
firing as the reference angular velocity, that is, the 
rotational fluctuation, which is calculated for each 
firing interval in synchronization with the combustion 
stroke in the internal combustion engine, misfire 
cannot be detected exactly when random misfire occurs 
or when misfire occurs approximately once for several 
revolutions. In Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. H2-49955, therefore, the reference 
angular velocity is renewed as necessary. As described above, the period of the 
predetermined crank angle is detected by using a crank 
angle sensor. The crank angle sensor typically 
includes a rotating member which has a plurality of 
vanes or protrusions disposed at equal angular 
intervals and is mounted to the crankshaft for 
rotation in unison therewith, and a detecting portion 
which is so disposed as to face the rotating member 
and detects the passage of the vane. The vane of the 
rotating member protrudes in the radial direction at 
the periphery of the rotating member. The number of 
vanes corresponds to the number of engine cylinders; 
for example, the crank angle sensor for a 6-cylinder 
engine has three vanes. With the crank angle sensor
