<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the production of shaped hydrogel
articles including soft contact lenses, and more particularly to
a method for the direct molding of such articles using a new class
of inert, displaceable diluents.Until recently, soft contact lenses of the hydrogel type have
been manufactured either by lathe cutting or spin casting. In the
lathe cutting method, a lens blank or button of a substantially
anhydrous hydrophilic polymer (xerogel) is mechanically cut and
polished to a lens shape on a fine lathe, and thereafter is
contacted with water or saline to hydrate the polymer and form the
desired hydrogel lens. The mechanical steps utilized in the lathe
cutting operation are similar to those used in the manufacture of
hard contact lenses, except that allowance must be made for
swelling of the lens during hydration of the polymer.In the spin casting method, a small quantity of hydrophilic
monomer mixture is placed in a concave, optically polished mold,
and the mold is rotated while the monomers are polymerized to form
a xerogel lens. The two optical surfaces of the lens are formed
simultaneously during polymerization, the outer surface being
formed by the concave mold surface and the inner surface being
shaped by the joint actions of centrifugal force generated by the
rotating mold and surface tension of the polymerization mixture.
The lens produced thereby is contacted with water or saline to
hydrate the polymer and form a hydrogel lens as in the case of the
lathe cut lens.More recently, an improved process for producing hydrogel
contact lenses has been developed, which method is not only more
economical than either the lathe cut method or the spin casting 
method, but it has the advantage of enabling a more precise control
over the final shape of the hydrated lens. This new method
comprises the direct molding of a monomer mixture wherein said
mixture is dissolved in a non-aqueous, displaceable solvent, the
mixture is placed in a mold having the precise shape of the final
desired hydrogel (i. e., water-swollen) lens, and the
monomer/solvent mixture is subjected to conditions whereby the
monomer(s) polymerize, to thereby produce a polymer/solvent mixture
in the shape of the final desired hydrogel lens. (The polymerization
is preferably carried out in a non-aqueous medium because
water can interfere with the polymerization reaction and adversely
affect the properties of the resulting polymer.) After the
polymerization is complete, the solvent is displaced with water to
produce a hydrated lens
