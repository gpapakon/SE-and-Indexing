<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diarylide pigment compositions and to printing inks,
especially of the publication gravure type, prepared from such pigment compositions.Diarylide pigments represent an important class of colouring materials used commonly for
the manufacture of printing inks. Pigment Yellow 12 is a widely used member of the
group for solvent based publication gravure printing inks and in this it is commonly
surface treated to impart certain desirable applicational properties. In this a typical
surface treatment agent is a long chain hydrocarbon amine. GB 1085835 teaches that fatty
primary amines may be used to treat Pigment Yellow 12 so as to impart good tinctorial
strength, gloss transparency and improved rheology. In US 4515639 diamines are also
used to treat diarylide pigments so as to reduce penetration of inks therefrom into lower
quality uncoated paper stock. There are numerous other patents which describe the use of
amine treatments to achieve an improved Pigment Yellow 12 for the preparation of
publication gravure inks, e.g. US 4643770, 4462833, 4220473, 3905825, 3827902,
3655641 and 3607861. Also in GB1472781 there is described the use of white inorganic
fillers in combination with hydrocarbon primary amine-treated diarylide pigments to
improve penetration with no loss of gloss and strength, the inorganic fillers being
precipitated chalk, china clay, blanc fix or talc.The present invention described the treatment of amine treated diarylide pigments
especially Pigment Yellow 12 with specific inorganic compounds with active oxide or
hydroxide surfaces resulting in significantly improved gloss and improved tinctorial value
in gravure inks.Accordingly the present invention provides a pigment composition comprising a diarylide
yellow pigment, a monoprimary amine, a diprimary amine, and an inorganic compound
having active oxide or hydroxide surfaces. The diarylide pigment compositions of the present invention may be e.g. Pigment Yellow
12, 13, 14, 17, 83, 114, 126, 127 176, Pigment Orange 16 or Pigment Orange 34 or
combinations or mixtures of these.A preferred pigment is Pigment Yellow 12 for its extensive use in solvent based
publication gravure printing inks.The monoprimary amines used to surface treat the pigment compositions of the invention
may be primary amines having a long chain alkyl group of 10 to 24 carbon atoms,
preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable monoprimary amines include
stearylamine, rosin amines, e.g. amine derivatives of wood resin (Â®Rosin Amine
