<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cross lamella for a light 
box, in which a plurality of cross lamellae are disposed at least 

substantially parallel to each other under (a) light source(s), 
transversely to the longitudinal direction of said box, and whereby the 

cross lamella is bounded by lateral boundary surfaces sloping upwards from 
the lower boundary edge of the lamella in a direction away from each other, 

said lateral boundary surfaces being interconnected near their upper edges 
by an upper boundary surface, in such a manner that the cross lamella is 

substantially triangular, seen in sectional view, and whereby the one 
lateral boundary surface extends upwards from the lower boundary edge of 

the cross lamella along a greater distance than does the other lateral 
boundary surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a light box, in which a plurality
of cross lamellae are disposed at least substantially parallel to each
other under (a) light source(s), transversely to the longitudinal
direction of said box, and whereby a cross lamella is bounded by
lateral boundary surfaces sloping upwards from the lower boundary edge
of the lamella in a direction away from each other, said lateral
boundary surfaces being interconnected near their upper edges by an
upper boundary surface, in such a manner that the cross lamella is
substantially triangular, seen in sectional view and whereby one
lateral boundary surface extends upwards from the lower boundary edge
of the cross lamella along a greater distance than does the other
lateral boundary surface
and said cross lamellae are
arranged mirror-symmetrically relative
to the centre plane of the light box
transverse to the longitudinal axis of
the light box.WO 90/112245 shows such a structure wherein the lamella or
transverse fins are arranged as pairs of single fins, with a mirror
symmetrical design about a center plane from each pair.According the invention the cross lamellae are arranged
with their upper
boundary surfaces sloping downward in the direction towards said
centre plane. In using the structure according the invention there
will be obtained an even distribution of the emitted light. As a result of the different angles of incidence and
exit of the light from the light source(s) achieved by altering the
position of the boundary surface, also the occurrence of objectionable
light reflections appears to be considerably less than is the case with
the constructions that have been usual so far. A further reduction of the
width of the upper boundary surface, seen in the longitudinal direction
of the light box, so that an even better utitilization of the light from
the light source(s) may be obtained, can be achieved when the connecting
lines between the side edges of the upper boundary surface and the upper
edges of the lateral boundary surfaces are both curved, whereby the centre
of curvature of each connecting line is located at the side of the
respective connecting line remote from the other connecting line.The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter
with reference to embodiments of the construction according to the
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures.Figure 1 is a side view of a cross lamella according
to the invention.Figure 2 is a smaller-scale cross-sectional view of
a number of cross lamellae arranged
