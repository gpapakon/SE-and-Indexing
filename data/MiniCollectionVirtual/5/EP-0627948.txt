<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brake for in-line and
traditional roller skates and skate boards (collectively
referred to as skates) as well as a method for braking
skates. Skates such as in-line roller skates are capable
of carrying users at great speeds and therefore are
desirably provided with a brake. Prior art skate brakes
are typically simply a piece of resilient material held by
a bracket that is attached to either the front or rear of
the skate. When braking is desired, the user pivots a
skate about its front or rear wheels and drags this
material along the ground.Unfortunately, when prior art brakes are dragged along
the ground, they have a tendency to "catch" at specific
points, causing the braking action to be jerky. This
catching makes braking difficult for beginning skaters,
since the sudden and uneven forces exerted can upset their
balance and cause them to fall. This has an obvious effect
on beginning skaters' enthusiasm for the sport. In
addition, the jerkiness involved in using traditional
brakes can make them difficult to use for even experienced
users, since the higher speeds often obtained by
experienced users demand even smoother braking to avoid an
accident.US-PS-334739 discloses a roller skate including a
friction brake which comprises a roller mounted for
rotation in a bracket and slidable vertically within the
bracket into contact with a brake pad carried by the
bracket by pressure imposed by movement of the roller into
engagement with the ground. In this disclosure, it is the
roller circumference which is forced into contact with the
brake pad. FR-A-2651147 discloses a skate which includes
a front roller mounted for rotation in a support on a pin 
which slides within openings made in the side walls of the
support. As for US-PS-334739, it is the roller
circumference which is forced into contact with a braking
surface of the support. In each of these documents,
contact between the respective rollers and braking surfaces
only takes place during operation of the brake.The present invention overcomes this disadvantage of
the prior art by providing a brake having a rotatable
assembly that rotates when in contact with the ground,
thereby eliminating catching, while permitting braking to
be applied smoothly and evenly, even at high speeds. The
smooth action of the present brake provides for more
stability during braking and for easier use among novice
users of the skate. The amount of braking provided by this
new brake design is determined by the rotational friction
of the rotatable

includes a plurality of wheels having a
circumferential ha
rdness and an average rotational
friction for rolling on a ground surface (12), the

skate brake comprising

a bracket (90; 190; 290) adapted to be mounted on
one end of the skate;
a rotatable assembly (100; 200; 300) mounted for
rotation in the bracket and positioned on the skate

such that the rotatable assembly is above ground
surface when no braking is desired,
the rotatable assembly having an outer
circumferential member (102; 202; 302) of generally

circular cross-section, an axis of rotation (101; 201;
301) perpendicular to the generally circular cross-section

or the outer circumferential member, first and
second axial ends (110, 112; 210, 212; 310, 312) , an

inner hub (104; 204; 304) fixedly attached to the
outer circumferential member, the skate brake being

characterised in that the rotatable assembly includes
a non-rotatable brake pad (120, 130; 220, 230; 322,

326; 332, 336) mounted in physical contact with one or
more interior surfaces (106, 116, 118; 206; 306, 316,

318) of the inner hub of the rotatable assembly,
rotational friction of the rotatable assembly being

greater than the average rotational friction of the
wheels;
the arrangement being such that the skate is
pivotable about at least one wheel to bring the

rotatable assembly into contact with the ground
surface to cause the rotatable assembly to rotate

about its axis of rotation and provide braking as a
result of the rotational friction of the rotatable

assembly.
A skate brake as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the outer
circumferential member (102; 202; 302) comprises a

resilient material having a hardness less than a
hardness of the skate wheels whereby the outer

circumferential member deforms when in contact with
the ground surface (12) to dissipate energy and impart

further braking action to the skate.
A skate brake as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the outer
circumferential member comprises urethane rubber.
A skate brake as claimed in any one of the preceding
Claims further comprising securing means (128: 228:

A skate brake as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the
securing mechanism comprises a flat surface (128; 228;

331) on the brake pad, at least one portion of the
bracket (90; 190; 290) defining a hole (94; 194; 294)

having a flat side (96; 196; 296) into which the brake
pad extends with the flat surface of the brake pad in
