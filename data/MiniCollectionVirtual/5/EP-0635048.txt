<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL NONLINEAR OPTICAL ARYLHYDRAZONES AND NONLINEAR OPTICAL POLYMERSTHEREOFThe present invention relates to dihydroxy arylhydrazones exhibiting nonlinear optical properties, and to materials comprising divalent moieties derived from nonlinear optical dihydroxy arylhydrazones. More particularly the present invention relates to novel nonlinear optical (NLO) polymeric compositions containing divalent moieties derived from the dihydroxy arylhydrazone in the backbone of the polymers and exhibiting stable nonlinear optical activity.Information may be more rapidly processed and transmitted using optical as opposed to electrical signals. Optical signals can be used to enhance the performance of electronics processors. For example, electronic wires interconnecting integrated circuits (ICs) can be replaced with optical interconnects and the information processed with IC driven electro-optic modulators. Optical signals in fiber optic communications can be encoded on the optical carrier using electro-optic (EO) modulators. In both of these processes, nonlinear optical materials with second-order nonlinear optical activity are necessary to effect modulation of the light signal.Nonlinear optical materials can also be used for frequency conversion of laser light. Such a conversion isdesirable in many applications. For example, optical memory media are presently read using 830 nm light from diode lasers. The 830 nm light wavelength limits the spot sizes which can be read and hence the density of data stored on the optical memory media. Similarly, in fiber optic communications, light wavelengths of 1.3 μm or 1.5 μm are desirable due to the low transmission losses of glass fiber at those wavelengths. However, those wavelengths are too long for detection by Si based detectors. It is desirable to frequency double the 1.3 μm or 1.5 μm wavelengths to 650 nm or 750 nm wavelengths where Si based detectors could be used.Nonlinear optical materials which have been used in electro-optic devices have in general been inorganic single crystals such as lithium niobate (LiNb03) or potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). More recently, nonlinear optical materials based on organic molecules, and in particular polar aromatic organic molecules have been developed.Organic nonlinear optical materials have a number of potential advantages over inorganic materials. First, organic nonlinear optical materials have higher NLO activity on a molecular basis. Organic crystals of 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline have been shown to have a higher nonlinear
