<ABSTRACT>
A container closure with a snap-on function consists of a bottom part (1) and a top part (2). The bottom part (1) and the top part (2) are connected to one another via a hinge strip (13) and via strip-shaped connection parts (14) which are arranged on both sides of the hinge strip (13) and are non-elastic. The attachment points (18) of the strip-shaped connection parts (14) on the bottom part (1) and on the top part (2) extend parallel to the pivot axis. In order to apply the spring force required for the snapping function, a slot (19) is provided in the top part (2) between the hinge strip (13) and each of the two strip-shaped connection parts (14), which slot extends essentially perpendicular to the plane of separation (7). The region (19') of the wall (2') of the top part (2) of the closure, said region being located between the slots (19), can be deflected back and forth independently of the other part of the top part (2).

A one-piece snap hinge of plastics material, consisting of two hinge parts (1, 2) 
connected together in hinged manner, for example the bottom part and the top part of a 

container closure, wherein the two hinge parts (1, 2) are connected together by at least 
one hinge strap (13) formed in one piece therewith and which forms a joint in the 

region of a plane of separation (27) between the two hinge parts and by strip-form 
connecting parts (14) on the two sides of the hinge strap (13), characterized in that the 

points of attachment (18) of the strip-form connecting parts (14) run parallel to the 
plane of separation (27), in that a cut (19) is formed in at least one of the hinge parts (1, 2) 

between the joint (13) and each of the two strip-form connecting parts (14), running 
from the edge of the hinge part (1, 2) lying in the plane of separation (27), and that 

the region (19') of the hinge part (2) disposed between the cuts (19), to which the joint 
(13) is connected, is elastically deformable and contributes the spring force for the 

snap action. 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that the cuts are formed as slots 
(19) running substantially perpendicular to the plane of separation (27). 
A hinge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the cuts (19) are 
provided in the top part (2) of a container closure consisting of a bottom part (1) and a 

top part (2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the cuts (19) 
widen inwardly from the outside of a hinge part (1, 2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the points of 
attachment (18) of the strip-form connecting parts (14) are thinner than the walls (6, 

2') of the hinge part (1, 2) adjoining the plane of separation (27). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the strip-form 
connecting parts (14) lie in the region of the outer surface of the walls (6, 2') of the  

 
hinge parts (1, 2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the strip-form 
connecting parts (14) pass over without thinned places into the walls (6, 2') of the 

hinge parts (1, 2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the strip-form 
connecting parts (14) have a constant thickness over the whole length. 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the strip-form 
connecting parts (14) assume a convexly bowed position standing out from the outer 

surface of the hinge parts (1, 2) with the snap hinge closed. 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the strip-form 
connecting parts (14) are straight with the hinge parts (1, 2) opened through 180Â° (the 

two surfaces and edge regions which lie against one another in the closed position 
lying in a single plane) and are substantially perpendicular to the adjoining walls (2' ,6) 

of the hinge parts (1, 2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the hinge strap 
(13) is disposed in an arc standing out from the adjoining walls (2', 6) of the hinge 

parts (1, 2) with the hinge parts (1, 2) folded together. 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the hinge strap 
(13) joining the two hinge parts (1, 2) is in the form of an elastically deformable strip. 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the hinge strap 
(13) has a region (16) of constant thickness between the hinge parts (1, 2). 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the hinge strap 
(13) increases in thickness towards the hinge parts (1, 2) at its ends.  

 
A hinge according to any of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that the hinge part 
(1, 2) with the cuts (19) is stiffened in the region (19') between the cuts (19) by at 

least one rib (35) approximately normal to the region (19').
