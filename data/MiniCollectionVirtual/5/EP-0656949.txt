<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to proteins encoded by vaccinia virus and which function to interfere with the host's immune system. In particular, the invention provides for use of the nucleotide sequence designated herein as B15R or of a nucleotide sequence coding for an allele of, or functionally equivalent fragment, derivative or variant of the polypeptide encoded by the B15R nucleotide sequence in a process relating to the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition in which interleukin-1 beta  is involved in the mediation of one or more symptoms associated with the condition. The invention also provides an anti-fever medicament which comprises a polypeptide which is encoded by the B15R gene product or an allele of, or functionally equivalent fragment, derivative or variant of that product.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VACCINIA VIRUS B15R USED IN INTERLEUKIN Bl-INVOLVING CONDITION.The present invention relates to vaccinia virus proteins, uses and products relating thereto.Where the term IL-lβ receptor is used in the text as referring to the vaccinia virus B15R polypeptide or allele or functionally equivalent fragment, derivative or variant thereof, the word "receptor" should be interpreted as referring to a substantially soluble binding protein.Live vaccinia virus was used as the vaccine to immunise against, and eradicate smallpox. Vaccinia virus (VV) is the prototypical member of the poxvirus family and therefore it has been extensively studied. It is a large DNA-containing virus which replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The linear double-stranded genome of approximately 185,000 base pairs has the potential to encode at least 200 proteins (Moss, B. (1990a)). The cytoplasmic site of replication requires that vaccinia virus encodes many enzymes and protein factors necessary for transcription and replication of its genome. The virus also encodes a variety o£ factors which modulate virus replication in the multicellular host and aid evasion of the host immune system (Moss, B. (1990a)). Advances in molecular genetics have made possible the construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses that contain and express genes derived from other organisms (for review see Mackett, M. & Smith G.L. (1986), J. Gen. Virol., 67, 2067-2082). The recombinant viruses retain their infectivity and express the foreign gene (or genes) during the normal replicative cycle of the virus. Immunisation of animals with the recombinant viruses has resulted in specific immune responses against the protein(s) expressed by the vaccinia virus, including those protein(s) expressed by the foreign gene(s) and in several cases has conferred protection against the pathogenic organism from which the foreign gene was 

derived.Recombinant vaccinia viruses have, therefore, potential application as new live vaccines in human or veterinary medicine. Advantages of this type of new vaccine include the low cost of vaccine manufacture and administration (because the virus is self-replicating), the induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the stability of the viral vaccine without refrigeration and the practicality of inserting multiple foreign genes from different organisms into vaccinia virus, to construct polyvalent vaccines effective against multiple pathogens. A disadvantage of this approach, is the use of a virus vaccine that has been

CLAIMS :
1. Use of the nucleotide sequence designated herein as B15R, or of a nucleotide sequence coding for an allele of, or functionally equivalent fragment, derivative or variant of the polypeptide encoded by the B15R nucleotide sequence, in a process relating to the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a condition in which interleukin-lβ is involved in the mediation of one or more symptoms associated with the condition.
2. Use of a polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence designated herein as B15R, or of an allele of, or functionally equivalent fragment, derivative or variant of the polypeptide, to manufacture a medicament for the treatment of a condition in which interleukin-lβ is involved in the mediation of one or more symptoms associated with the condition.
3. Use according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the condition is selected from the group consisting of: inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, cancer, fever; inflammatory bowl disease; graft versus host disease and diabetes.
