<ABSTRACT>
A processing vessel (10) for a liquid includes an 
impeller (32) in an open-ended shroud (30) to cause 

circulation. The base of the vessel (10) communicates 
with a short duct (18) closed at its lower end, and the 

shroud (30) is shaped to ensure circulation into this 
dead-end duct (18). The duct is provided with ultrasonic 

modules (24) so that its contents are subjected to 
intense insonation. The insonation of the liquid can 

lead to improvements in the product of processes such as 
crystallisation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vessel for use in
processing liquids or liquid/solid mixtures, and in
particular to a vessel for subjecting the liquid or
liquid/solid mixture to insonation.If a liquid is subjected to a high ultrasonic
intensity, for example above 0.3 W/cm2, then there is a
significant deposition of energy into the liquid through
attenuation and non-linear effects. This can be
associated with cavitation in which small bubbles are
created which are filled with vapour or gas, and which
collapse rapidly during the compression half-cycle of the
ultrasonic wave. Temperature transients of thousands of
degrees and pressure transients of hundreds of
atmospheres are produced over volumes a few tens to
hundreds of micrometres across. Transient shock waves
are also produced in the vicinity of the cavitation
bubbles. The resulting chemical changes may be referred
to as sonochemistry, while there may also be physical
changes, such as emulsification. A device for subjecting
liquid in a tube of 125 mm bore to such insonation is
described in GB 2 243 092 A. However only a small volume
of liquid can be insonated in such a device, and the use
of such a device in a pumped loop connected to a reaction
vessel (as suggested in that document) is not always
acceptable.Subjecting the contents of a tank to ultrasonic
waves has been suggested for example by Willems (US 3 161
402), but he teaches that using magnetostrictive or
piezoelectric transducers for this purpose is not
practical as the intensity of the ultrasound is too low.
He proposes the use of mechanical oscillators with sets
of intermeshing teeth which rotate relative to each
other, so generating high frequency oscillations and also 
effecting circulation of a liquid; such a device can be
used to break down wood chips and splinters to form a
fibrous pulp suitable for paper-making. A reactor vessel
incorporating ultrasonic transducers in the walls and
base is described in EP 0 584 685 (Hoechst AG). The
transducers can be integral with, that is to say welded
into, the wall and base; there might be as many as
thirteen transducers, eight in the wall and five in the
base.According to the present invention there is provided
a processing vessel comprising walls and a base defining
a container for a liquid, an impeller to cause flow of
liquid in the container, means to define a duct whose
bore communicates with the liquid in the container and is
of considerably smaller cross-sectional area than the
container, and insonation means to subject liquid in the
duct to a
