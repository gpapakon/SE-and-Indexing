<ABSTRACT>
An optical displacement sensor suitable for use in drowned environments 
where the refractive index of a medium in the optical path may vary, 

comprises a light source (2) emitting first to fourth (λ1-λ4) wavelengths. 
The first and second wavelengths are within the infrared region of the 

spectrum, whereas the third and fourth wavelengths are in the visible 
region of the spectrum. A zone plate (14) focuses the first and second 

wavelengths to respective positions substantially at the extremes of 
movement of a reflective element (10) whose position is to be measured. 

The zone plate also focuses the third and fourth wavelengths to 
respective positions. A cold mirror is interposed between the zone plate 

and the reflective element (10) and is arranged to transmit the first and 
second wavelengths and to reflect the third and fourth wavelengths. The 

ratio of the intensities of the light reflected from the cold mirror gives 
information about the refractive index of the medium in the optical path. 

This information can be used to correct the measurement of the position 
of the reflective element which is determined by the ratio of reflected 

intensities of the first and second wavelengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical displacement sensor. Such a 
sensor may be used in environments where the refractive index of a 
transmissive medium in the optical path may be subject to variation or 
where the quality of the optical path may vary or be degraded. GB 2188143A discloses a position sensor in which white light from an 
optical fibre is focused onto a movable holographic zone plate. 
Monochromatic light reflected from the zone plate is collected by a 
second optical fibre and conveyed to a wavelength analyzer. US 4798951 discloses a position sensor in which first and second 
wavelengths of light are directed at an axially movable element. The 
element carries a filter having first and second surfaces separated by a 
distance t in the direction of movement of the element. The first surface 
reflects light of the first wavelength and the second surface reflects light 
of the second wavelength. The value of l1(l2-l1) varies as a linear 
function of displacement of the element, where l1 and l2 are the 
intensities of the reflected light of the first and second wavelengths, 
respectively. DE 3604038A also discloses an arrangement in which light of two 
dissimilar wavelengths is focused by an imaging system having different 
focal length for each wavelength. The intensities of the wavelengths after 
reflection from a movable element are compared to determine the 
distance to the element.  Known optical displacement sensors relying on radiation being reflected 
from a surface are adversely affected by changes in the refractive index 
of the medium surrounding the sensor. According to the present invention there is provided an optical 
displacement sensor for measuring displacement of a reflective element 
which is movable between first and second positions, comprising: means 
for providing first radiation of a first wavelength, second radiation of a 
second wavelength, third radiation of a third wavelength, and fourth 
radiation of a fourth wavelength;
 
focusing means having a focal length which is a function of wavelength 
for focusing the first radiation at substantially the first position, the 
second radiation at substantially the second position, the third radiation 
at a third position and the fourth radiation at a fourth position;
 
a reflective surface for reflecting the third and fourth radiations; and 
photosensing means arranged to measure the relative intensities of the 
first and second radiations reflected from the reflective element and the 
relative intensities of the
