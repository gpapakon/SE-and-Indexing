<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 2-cyano-1,3-dione derivatives, processes for
their preparation, compositions containing them, and their use as herbicides.EP-A-0213892 discloses herbicidally active enol compounds and
specifically discloses certain 2-cyano-1,3-dione derivatives. EP-A-0496630 and
0496631 describe certain 2-cyano-1,3-diones as herbicides which contain a sulphur
substituent at the 4-position and 2-position respectively of the benzoyl moiety.The present invention provides 2-cyano-1,3-diones of formula I:

wherein:
R represents cyclopropyl;R1 represents:-
a hydrogen, chlorine or bromine atom, ora straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing up to 6
carbon atoms which is substituted by -OR5; ora group selected from R5, nitro, cyano, -S(O)pR5, -OR5,
-O(CH2)mOR5 and -CO2R5;R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each
represents: -
a halogen or hydrogen atom, ora straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing up to 6
carbon atoms which is substituted by -OR5; ora group selected from R5, nitro, cyano, -OR5, -O(CH2)mOR5,
-S(O)qR5 and -CO2R5,R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, each
represents:-
a straight- or branched-chain all group containing up to 6
carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more
halogen atoms which may be the same or different;m is an integer from 1 to 3;n is zero, 1 or 2; p is zero, 1 or 2; q is zero, 1 or 2;with the proviso that when R1 represents -S(O)pR5 at least
one of the groups p and q is zero;
   metal complexes thereof, and agriculturally acceptable salts
thereof, which possess valuable herbicidal properties.Compounds of formula I may exist in enolic tautomeric
forms that may give rise to geometric isomers around the enolic
double bond.Furthermore, in certain cases the substituents R, R1, R2, R3,
R4, and R5 may contribute to optical isomerism and/or
stereoisomerism. All such forms are embraced by the present
invention.By the term "agriculturally acceptable salts" is meant salts the
cations of which are known and accepted in the art for the
formation of salts for agricultural or horticultural use. Preferably
the salts are water soluble.Suitable salts formed by compounds of formula I which are
acidic, i.e. in enolic tautomeric forms, with bases include alkali
metal (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal (e.g.
calcium and magnesium) salts, ammonium (e.g.
dioctylmethylamine and morpholine) salts.By the term "metal complexes" is meant compounds in which
one or both of the oxygen atoms of the 1,3-dione act as chelating
