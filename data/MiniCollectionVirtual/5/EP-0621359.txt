<ABSTRACT>
The thread-guiding and bearing device (2), consisting of a thread-guide channel (2a) and an aligning region (2c), serves for threading a weft thread (3a) automatically into the eye (5a) of a thread-deflecting member (4a). The thread-guide channel (2a) has an entry orifice (2k), an exit orifice (2e) and a slot (2d) extending in the direction of run (2g) of the weft thread (3a). A thread-deflecting member (4a) with an eye (5a) is brought into a threading position and, in the threading position, bears on the stop face (2f) of the aligning region (2c). Fluid flowing out of the thread-guide channel (2a) flows through the eye (5a) presented in this way, so that the thread tip of a weft thread (3a) conveyed through the thread-guide channel (2a) is carried by the presented eye (5a) and the weft thread (3a) is thus threaded into the thread-deflecting member (4a). The fluid nozzle (13b) feeds fluid to the thread-guide channel (2a). A further fluid nozzle (13c) delivers the weft thread (3a) to a further thread-guide member after threading has taken place. The thread-guiding and bearing device (2) is thereupon moved away, in such a way that the weft thread (3a) held in the eye (5a) is drawn through the slot (2d) out of the thread-guide channel (2a).
