<ABSTRACT>
Process for constructing a structure under an embankment of a railway (1) or of a roadway, consisting in temporarily cutting the track (road) (1) in line with the intended location in the embankment (2) of this track for the passage to be produced, and in digging a ditch (25) by excavating the ground at this location, characterised in that it consists in manufacturing or arranging, in advance, on at least one side of the ditch (25), optionally in both of the sides of this ditch, on either side of the embankment and opposite each other, at least one flat support and guide reinforcement (3) for a hollow concrete frame (13), the frame (13) being borne by the reinforcement (3) outside the ditch (25), in fitting, parallel to the side edges of the hollow frame (13), at least one traction cable (20), this cable (20) being solidly attached at one end to a fixed anchoring point (12, 28), while the other end engages with a jack (actuator) (19) borne by the frame (13), so that the traction force exerted on the cable (20) by the jack (19) is converted, owing to the reaction on the anchoring boss (12, 28), into a thrust effect on the frame (13), which progressively slides over the reinforcement (3) then over the ground in the ditch (25), in order to cause it to penetrate directly into this ditch, in front of the reinforcement (3).

A process for building a structure under the supporting embankment (2) of 
a railway (1) or a road, consisting in temporarily cutting out the roadway 

directly over the site in the embankment (2) supporting this roadway that is 
intended for the passage to be produced, and in making a cutting (25) by 

excavating the earth at this location, characterised in that it consists in first 
manufacturing or providing, on at least one side of the cutting, or if necessary 

on both sides of the latter, on either side of the embankment and facing each 
other, at least one flat plate (3) to support and guide a hollow concrete frame 

(13), the frame being supported by the plate outside the cutting, in 
positioning, parallel to the lateral sides of the hollow frame, at least one 

traction cable (20), this cable being fastened securely at one end to a fixed 
anchorage point (12, 28) while the other end is captured by an actuator (19) 

carried by the frame, so that the traction effort exerted on the cable by the 
actuator is translated, following the reaction on the anchorage point, into a 

thrust effect on the frame, which gradually slides over the plate, then over the 
floor of the cutting (25), in order to ensure directly that it penetrates inside the 

latter, in front of the plate. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the flat plate (3) is 
arranged so that it has a boss (12) constituting the anchorage point for the 

traction cable (20), this boss being provided in the vicinity of the end of the 
plate pointing towards the cutting (25). 
A process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
anchorage point is constituted by means of a solid body (28), fixed into the 

ground (7), arranged on the other side of the cutting (25) from the plate (3), 
the traction cable (20) extending across the cutting. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it 
consists in associating each frame (13) with two first parallel cables (20), 

extending respectively along each of the lateral sides (15, 16) of this frame.  
 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that each 
frame (13) is made to co-operate with four parallel cables (20, 26), in twos, 

symmetrical on either side of the median plane of the frame, the first two 
cables (20) being arranged along the lateral sides outside the frame, while 

the second two (26) pass freely through the longitudinal passages provided 
inside the lower slab (14) of the frame. 
A process according to Claim 5, characterised in that two anchorage points 
are provided, constituted by bosses (12) provided on the plate on either side 

of the frame (13) for a pair of parallel cables (20), and two other anchorage 
points constituted by two solid bodies (28) fastened securely into the ground 

(7) for the other pair of cables (26). 
A process according to Claim 6, characterised in that the cables of one of the 
pairs are the first cables (20) and the cables of the other pair are the second 

cables (26), or vice versa. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that there 
are anchorage bosses (12) for the cables (20) in the front portion of each 

plate (3), as near as possible to the sides of the cutting (25) in the 
embankment (2), the traction actuators (19) being mounted in the rear portion 

of the frame (13) supported by the plate. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that into 
each plate (3) there is incorporated a foot (6), rectangular in profile, the width 

of which is substantially equal to that of the frame (13). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the 
plate or plates (3) are immobilised on the ground (7), on either side of the 

embankment (2) supporting the roadway (1), by means of projecting portions 
(6), capable of being buried in the ground so as to constitute anchorage 

"spades" for each plate.  
 
A process according to Claim 10, characterised in that the plate or plates (3) 
are put into compression by means of an additional cable (33), stretched 

between one of the projecting portions (6) in the vicinity of the end of the 
plate, pointing towards the cutting (25), and the opposite end (35) of the 

plate, this cable exerting a pre-stressing effort on the plate, opposing that 
created by the traction cables (20, 26). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that each 
concrete frame (13) is given external bosses (18) at the side, allowing the 

mounting of traction actuators, each of these external bosses being provided 
facing a boss (12) or an anchorage block (28). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised in that use 
is made of multi-strand cables formed of strands (21) the ends of which are 

fastened securely to a bearing plate (24) abutting against the face opposite 

the anchorage point (12). 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that 
raised edges (11) are contrived at the side of each plate (3) to give lateral 

guidance for the frame (13) supported by this plate. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised in that, 
between the lower face of each frame (13) and the upper face of the plate 

(3), a layer of bentonite or another similar material suitable for the mutual 
lubrication of the facing surfaces is injected in order to improve the sliding of 

the frame.
