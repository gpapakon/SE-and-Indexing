<ABSTRACT>
The radar surveillance system comprises, in combination, a fixed antenna (10) for furnishing an electronic scanning of the space in azimuth in the horizontal plane, a transmission source (GEN) and UHF transmission/reception facilities (HFA; HFB), with a circulator (20), a transmission channel (VE), a reception channel (VR) and means (DIR; 29) for subdividing the reception channel into a sum signal (VR1) and at least one difference signal (VR2). A first and a second receiver elements, with a frequency changing (REC1 and REC2), receive the sum and difference signals respectively, and supply digitally coded outputs. Processing means (40) process the digital signals originating from the first and second receiving elements (REC1 and REC2) for radar detection of objects in the area subject to surveillance.
