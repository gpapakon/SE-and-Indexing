<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bipolar temporary 
pacing lead which is temporarily used for post-operative 
myocardial stimulation, including pacing and sensing 
electrodes, and an affixation coil for lead anchoring as well 
as an external connector adapted for receiving the proximal 
end of the temporary lead. Temporary heart wires are known in the art, for example, 
United States Patents 4,541,440 to Parsonnet and 4,341,226 to 
Peter Peters (assignee Medtronic), Temporary Lead with 
Insertion Tool. Such devices are adapted to be placed in the heart wall 
by means of a curved needle wherein the electrodes remain 
within the heart wall and the proximal end of the lead is 
brought to the exterior of the patient's chest by means of a 
second straight needle, located at the proximal end of the 
heart wire. Devices known in the prior art have drawbacks as their 
construction is somewhat primitive in that the electrodes 
constitute merely exposed portions of the conductive wire 
within the lead, no means is provided for affixing the bipolar 
electrodes within the heart and dislodgement is a problem, and 
the lead itself tends to be stiff as it is constructed of two 
separate wires which lie in a side-by-side configuration 
causing stiffness in at least one direction of bending. Also, there remains the problem of providing an external 
connector for the proximal end of the wire which extends 
externally from the patient's chest. There is a need for a 
convenient, easy-to-use, interface, or connector, between the 
lead per se and the external temporary pulse generator. Such 
a connector must not require substantial electrical or 
mechanical manipulations on the part of the surgeon, should be 
comfortable to the patient, and the electrical contacts must 
be secure and reliable. Further, the connector should be 
reasonably economical to manufacture, and, preferably, even 
disposable. DE-A-2605637 discloses a temporary monopolar lead and a 
breakaway needle, wherein the needle is broken by hand 
and the remaining needle portion is inserted directly 
into a socket of the pacer.  
 According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a connector for the proximal end of a temporary heart 
lead wherein the proximal end includes a first proximal electrode, 
and a second proximal electrode with that second proximal 
electrode comprising a breakaway needle having along its length a 
point of intended breaking, the connector comprising: 
a housing having an entry means and an exit means for
