A hydraulic brake system with a device arranged to control 
both the brake slip and the traction slip, including a 

master cylinder (1) connected to a reservoir (20) and to a 
brake circuit (2) which can be separated from the master 

cylinder (1) by way of a separating valve (6), the brake 
circuit (2) comprising the wheel brakes (3', 3'') for the 

wheels driven by the vehicle engine, and valves (4, 12) for 
the control of the pressure in the wheel brakes depending on 

sensors which monitor the rotational behaviour of the 
wheels, further comprising a pump (8) which delivers 

pressure fluid into the brake circuit, and a medium-pressure 
accumulator (13) having a pilot pressure in excess of the 

resistances in the brake circuit and being connected to the 
suction side of the pump (8), wherein a switching valve (15) 

is provided in the connecting line (14) between the medium-pressure 
accumulator (13) and the suction side of the pump 

(8), and wherein the medium-pressure accumulator (13) is 
loaded by the pump (8) through a loading line (16) which 

connects the pressure side of the pump (8) to the medium-pressure 
accumulator (13) and includes a pressure-relief 

valve (17),
characterized
 in that the pump (8) aspirates 
pressure fluid from the reservoir (20) to load the medium-pressure 

accumulator. 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim l,
characterized
 in that in its locking position 
the switching valve (l5) functions as a pressure relief 

valve which determines the maximum filling pressure of the 
medium-pressure accumulator (l3).  

 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in anyone of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a non-return valve 
arrangement (l8, 24) allows an unloading of the 

medium-pressure accumulator (l3) exclusively in the delivery 
direction of the pump (8). 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that, in the connection 
between the suction side of the pump (8) and the reservoir 

(20), an electromagnetically operated shut-off valve (23), 
closed when de-energized, is inserted. 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that a shut-off valve (23), 
which is operated hydraulically by the master cylinder 

pressure and is open in the pressureless condition, is 
inserted in the connection between the suction side of the 

pump (8) and the reservoir (20).
