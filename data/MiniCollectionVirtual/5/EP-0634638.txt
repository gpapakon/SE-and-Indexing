<ABSTRACT>
For checking and adjusting the accuracy of the braking force display on roll test stands (10), an adjustment device (22) is proposed, which can be mounted on the housing frame (11) of the roll test stand (10) close to the free end of a torque lever (18) in the region of the associated measured value pick-up (19). For aligning the adjustment device (22), an adapter plate (23) is provided, which can be fastened to a weighing cell (24), which carries on its projecting end a pressure screw (25), which is used for generating calibration forces on the torque lever (18) at its characteristic loading point (41). The weighing cell (24) measures by means of strain gauges (22) the shear forces and thus the calibration forces and displays these measured values in a measurement display device (44), so that they can be compared with the braking force displays to be checked.

Adjusting device for a roller-type test stand for
testing the brakes and/or the power of motor vehicles, in

which roller-type test stand at least one pair of rollers
(12, 13) is mounted in a housing frame (11) and the

driving roller (12) of which can be driven by an electric
motor (15) via a gear (16), the motor and gear being

pendulously mounted on a shaft (17) of the driving roller
and being supported on the housing frame, via a measurement

transducer (19), by means of a torque lever (18)
fastened to the gear, characterized in that the adjusting

device (22) has an adaptor (23), by means of which it can
be fastened to the housing frame (11) of the roller-type

test stand (10) in the region of the measurement transducer
(19), in that the adaptor (23) has arranged on it

an electrical weighing cell (24), the housing of which
(33) can be fastened at one end (34) to the adaptor (23),

whilst an adjustable pressure element (25) is arranged at
the other free housing end (36) projecting beyond the

adaptor, the said pressure element cooperating, in the
installed state, with a load point (41) on the torque

lever (18), and in that the weighing cell (24) is
operatively connected to a measurement indicator (44).
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the adaptor (23) is of a plate-shaped

design and has, in particular, a plurality of bores (31)
or perforations which serve for fastening it.
Adjusting device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the weighing cell (24) works with

strain gauges (42). 
Adjusting device according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the parallelepipedic housing (33) of the

weighing cell (24) is of bar-shaped design and the strain
gauges (42) determining the shearing forces are arranged

on the two side faces of the said housing between the two
ends (34, 36).
Adjusting device according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 4, character
ized in that the pressure element
is designed as a pressure screw (25), the longitudinal

axis of which runs essentially vertically, in particular
perpendicularly to the adaptor plate (23).
Adjusting device according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the pressure element (25) has a

bowl support (38) at its end facing the torque lever
(18).
Adjusting device according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that the adaptor (23) is designed for

receiving a locking screw (27) which can be fastened to
the housing frame (11) of the roller-type test stand (10)

at a transport hole (29).
Adjusting device according to one of Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that the weighing cell (24) is

connected via a cable (43) to an electrical measurement
indicator device (44) which forms a structural member

separate from the weighing cell (24).
Adjusting device according to one of Claims 1 to
8, characterized in that, in the installed state, the

load point (41) on the torque lever (18) is arranged at
a distance from the shaft (17) of the driving roller (12)

which corresponds to five to seven times the roller
radius.
Adjusting device according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the weighing cell

(24) is arranged on the adaptor (23) so as to be pivotable
relative to it and releasable from it, in particular

by means of a screw connection (35).
