<ABSTRACT>
A transformer structure of modular parts comprises a bobbin for 
supporting the primary winding, and one or more sets of end pieces sized to 

successively fit one over another in a nesting arrangement. The end piece flanges 
provide part of the secondary winding support surface. Further winding surfaces may 

be provided by adding further sets of end pieces which nest one within the other. The 
end piece flanges afford added inter-winding isolation. A double flange version of 

the end pieces affords still greater isolation. While applicable to small-scale 
transformers, the concept can also be adapted for medium and larger-size 

transformer designs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power supply transformers and, more 
specifically, to a modular design for supporting the primary and other windings in 
transformers to provide enhanced inter-winding isolation and which is adaptable to 
multiple applications. Small-scale transformers for use in personal computers and similar 
equipments typically must be designed to meet the power supply requirements of the 
particular equipment. Designing and manufacturing individually customized 
transformers is costly, however. Workers in the art use where possible pre-existing 
configurations of winding bobbins, end caps, terminal pieces, etc. in new equipment 
power supplies. Often, however, use in further small transformer applications is not 
possible without making costly design adaptations. This invention is a small-scale transformer structure made up of 
modular parts. In its basic design, the structure comprises a centerpiece with bobbin 
for containing the primary winding. One or several pairs of end pieces along with 
interwinding tapes that support the secondary winding mount on the respective ends 
of the centerpiece. These end pieces are sized to successively fit one over the other 
in gang fashion to provide more winding options. The flange or shoulder of each 
successive ganged end piece provides a part of the surface for the further winding, 
and serves as margins for meeting safety requirements. The end pieces also contain 
slots or grooves that secure the winding lead wires en route to the terminals. A female fit of the bobbin-contacting end pieces over the primary 
bobbin ends is provided by a pair of concentric skirts forming a double flange that 
extends from the end piece. The skirts place continuous insulative material over the 
exterior surface of the bobbin end and also into the underside on the bobbin end, to 
provide added electrical isolation between the windings and the core when the 
transformer is fully assembled. The structures are completed by two end caps serving as terminal pieces 
into which the exterior faces of the end pieces fit. The end caps provide a means for 
mounting of the assembly onto a circuit board of the equipment. Besides being  
 
modular, the structure reduces or eliminates the need for margin tapes and sleevings 
for meeting insulation requirements. FIG. 1 is an exploded assembly diagram illustrating the transformer 
components using a first embodiment of end piece; FIG. 2 is an assembly diagram illustrating the double flange version of
