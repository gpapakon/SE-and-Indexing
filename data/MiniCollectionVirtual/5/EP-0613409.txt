<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to automatic riveting devices, and more
particularly to a feed blind or pop riveting device having an
automatic rivet feed means.Considerable technological effort has been expended in developing blind or
pop or mandrel-type rivets, hereinafter collectively referred to as blind rivets, and
the associated manually operated devices for setting such rivets. The primary
requirement for setting blind rivets is to support the enlarged flange of the rivet
body against an anvil or rivet table with the rivet body inserted through a closely
mating hole in a work surface. The mandrel extends axially through the rivet
table and is gripped by jaws which tension and pull the mandrel rearwardly,
expanding the body of the rivet to a point where the mandrel is fractured away.
Thus, blind rivets are particularly useful in situations where a conventional
riveting tool does not have access to both sides of the working surfaces to be
rivet-connected together.What appears to be a second stage in the development of blind rivets has
been toward the automatic setting of the rivet wherein a source of power such
as a motor, a pneumatic actuator, or hydraulics, are utilized to replace manual
effort in expanding and setting the rivet through mandrel pull.This riveting technology has also expanded into the development of
automatic riveting devices which include an automatic feed means for the rivets
themselves. Prior to such development, the user has been required to manually
insert each fresh rivet into the rivet table, one at a time. Because these devices
still require the user to depress an actuator or trigger to set each rivet, these
devices are referred to as "semiautomatic" rivet machines having an automatic
feed.The bulk of these automatic feed rivet devices fall generally into two
categories. The first category is one wherein the nosepiece and/or rivet table
is pivotally or arcuately connected wherein these components swing apart
radially outwardly from one another so that a new rivet may be passed forward
longitudinally from behind this arrangement into position, whereupon the
nosepiece and/or rivet table components are closed around the rivet body and
mandrel with the flange of the rivet against the distal end surface of the rivet
table.The second general category of automatic rivet feed means is directed to an
external arm arrangement which swings or pivots a fresh rivet into coaxial 
alignment forwardly of the rivet anvil and then either automatically draws or
allows the rivet to be

means for automatically feeding a mandrel (M) of a blind rivet (R) one at
a time laterally into a longitudinal aperture (112) in said rivet table

extending transversely in one direction from said aperture (112);
jaw means forwardly biased and slidably mounted within said outer
tubular means (30) for gripping each mandrel (M) when said outer

tubular means (30) is moved to said retracted position;
rivet setting and mandrel separating means connected to said jaw
means for pulling and detaching the mandrel (M) longitudinally

away from the rivet head and for laterally ejecting each detached
mandrel (M).
A blind rivet setting device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein:

said jaw means comprises a plurality of jaws (34) operably connected
within a forward end of an elongate tubular inner sleeve (32)

slidably mounted for longitudinal movement within said outer
tubular means (30).
A blind rivet setting device as claimed in Claim 2, wherein:

said rivet setting and mandrel separating means is connected to a
rearward point of said inner sleeve (32) for forcibly urging said 

jaws (34) grippingly engaged around the mandrel (M) and said
inner sleeve (32) rearwardly within said outer tubular means (30)

whereby the rivet (R) is expanded and set and the mandrel (M) is
fracturably detached therefrom.
A blind rivet setting device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3,
wherein:


said automatic rivet feed means includes an elongate strip (150) of thin
flexible material having a lead end and a plurality of blind rivets

connected in spaced apart relation along the length of said flexible
strip (150) by having the distal portion of each mandrel pierced

through and retained within said flexible strip (150);
said flexible strip (150) slidably feeding through a transverse feed slot
(116) formed through said rivet table (62), said feed slot (116)

orthogonally intersecting said mandrel receiving slot (68, 114, 118);
biased means (156) connected to said lead end for pulling said flexible
strip (150) through said transverse slot (116) to draw each

mandrel (M) of each blind rivet (R) held in said flexible strip (150)
and positioned immediately adjacent said rivet table (62) one at a

time into said rivet table aperture (112) through said mandrel
receiving slot (68, 114, 118).
A blind rivet setting device as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, or Claim 4
so far as it is dependent on Claim 2, further comprising:


an ejection plate (38) connected to a rearward end of an elongate jaw
spreader (36) slidably positioned within said inner sleeve (32)
