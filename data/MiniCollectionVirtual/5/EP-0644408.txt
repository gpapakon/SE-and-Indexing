<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for visibly 
outlining the energy zone to be measured by a radiometer. 

A laser sighting device (12) is provided on the radiometer, 
adapted to emit at least one laser beam (14) against a 

surface whose temperature is to be measured, with said 
laser beam being positioned about the energy zone (E) to 

visibly outline said energy zone. This may be achieved by 
directing the beam (14) from the laser sighting device (12) 

onto a mirror (30) which is rotated by motive means (32) to 
deflect the beam to sweep out a circular path to define the 

energy zone (E).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for
accurately measuring the temperature of a surface using infrared measurement
techniques and, more particularly, to such a method and apparatus which
utilizes a laser sighting device to target the energy zone on a surface from
which the temperature is to be measured.Remote infrared temperature measuring devices (commonly referred to
as infrared pyrometers or radiometers) have been used for many years to
measure the temperature of a surface from a remote location. Their principle
of operation is well known. All surfaces at a temperature above absolute zero
emit heat in the form of radiated energy. This radiated energy is created by
molecular motion which produces electromagnetic waves. Thus, some of the
energy in the material is radiated in straight lines away from the surface of the
material. Many infrared radiometers use optical reflection and/or refraction
principles to capture the radiated energy from a given surface. The infrared
radiation is focused upon a detector, analyzed and, using well known
techniques, the surface energy is collected, processed and the temperature is
calculated and displayed on an appropriate display.Examples of such infrared radiometers are illustrated at pages J-1
through J-42 of The Omega Engineering Handbook, Volume 2B. See, also,
U.S. Patent No. 4,417,822 which issued to Alexander Stein et al. on November
29, 1983 for a Laser Radiometer; U.S. Patent No. 4,527,896 which issued to
Keikhosrow Irani et al. on July 9, 1985 for an Infrared Transducer-Transmitter
for Non-Contact Temperature Measurement; and U.S. Patent No. 5,169,235
which issued to Hitoshi Tominaga et al. for Radiation Type Thermometer on
December 8, 1992. Also see Baker, Ryder and Baker, Volume II, Temperature
Measurement in Engineering, Omega Press, 1975, Chapters 4 and 5.When using such radiometers to measure surface temperature, the 
instrument is aimed at a target or "spot" within the energy zone on the surface
on which the measurement is to be taken. The radiometer receives the emitted
radiation through the optical system, and it is focussed upon an infrared
sensitive detector which generates a signal which is internally processed and
converted into a temperature reading which is displayed.The precise location of the energy zone on the surface as well as its size
are extremely important to insure accuracy and reliability of the resultant
measurement. It will be readily appreciated that the field of view of the optical
systems of such
