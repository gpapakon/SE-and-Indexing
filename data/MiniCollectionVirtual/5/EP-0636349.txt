<ABSTRACT>
Toothbrush with two members (2, 3) which are pivotable relative to one another and of which a first member (2) serves as a handle and a second member (3) is provided with a brush head (5). Between the members there is a spring (7), one of whose ends (8) is firmly connected to one of the members (2), while the other end (9) rests against a wall part (11) of the other member (3). On use of the toothbrush, the second member (3) can be pivoted relative to the first member (2) counter to a pressing force exerted by the spring (7), and the spring springs back when a predetermined threshold (Pd) for the pressing force is exceeded, whereupon the second housing member (3) is exclusively subjected to a bending load in the absence of a pushing force (Q) directed in the longitudinal direction of the spring (7) and exerted by the wall part (11), while it returns to its original position when the pressing force decreases.

<CLAIMS>
A toothbrush comprising two parts (2, 3) which are pivotable relative to
one another, of which a first part (2) serves as a handle and of which a second part (3)

carries a brush-head (5), a spring (7) being arranged between the parts and having one
end (8) fixedly connected to one (2) of the parts, the second part (3) being pivotable

relative to the first part (2) against a pressure exerted by the spring (7) during use of the
toothbrush, which spring snaps when a given pressure threshold (P
d
) is exceeded and
resumes its original position when the pressure has decreased, 
characterized in that
 the
other part (3) has a wall portion (11), said wall portion (11), in a situation after

snapping of the spring (7), following a path (13) which differs from the path (14) of the
spring end portion (9) which engages against wall portion (11) before snapping, and the

spring being subjected to a pressure (Q) directed in the longitudinal direction of the
spring and exerted by the wall portion (11) when the other part (3) is pivoted and being

subjected exclusively to a bending load (Q) after snapping in the absence of the pressure
(Q) exerted by the wall portion (11).
A toothbrush as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the wall portion
(11) of the relevant part (2, 3) has two surfaces (10, 12) forming an angle with one

another, the end portion (9) of the spring being in contact with a first surface (10)
before snapping and being in contact with the other second surface (12) after snapping.
A toothbrush as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the spring
has a linear characteristic after snapping.
