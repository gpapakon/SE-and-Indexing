<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for producing a product having a cheese flavour by incubating one or more amino acids with a soluble fraction obtainable on disruption of lactic acid bacterial cells, the amino acid, at a concentration of at least 0.2 mmol/l, and the soluble fraction being added to a base material. The amino acid is, for example, methionine or phenylalanine. A cheese aroma concentrate is likewise described which is suitable for producing a product having cheese flavour, which concentrate contains at least one amino acid and a soluble fraction to be obtained on disruption of cells of lactic acid bacteria and any other bacteria, or else contains the mixture obtained after incubating the amino acid and the soluble fraction.
