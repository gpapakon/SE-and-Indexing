<ABSTRACT>
A continuously variable transmission comprises a sun wheel (11, 
66) and at least one planet wheel (3, 65) having a double, essentially 

conical surface (30, 31, 64, 71, 72), which planet wheel (3, 65) interacts 
on one side with the sun wheel (11, 66) and on the other side with an 

annulus wheel (2, 73), as well as adjusting means (5, 6, 16) for changing 
the transmission ratio. Each planet wheel (3, 65) is provided with an 

intermediate wheel (9, 59) which interacts on one side with the sun wheel 
(11, 66) and on the other side with said planet wheel (3, 65). Each planet 

wheel (3, 65) and, where appropriate, intermediate wheel (9, 59) is also 
adjustable about an imaginary axis which runs transversely to the centre 

line of the sun wheel (11, 66), such that each planet wheel (3, 65) can be 
brought into positions with respect to the annulus wheel (2, 59) in which 

they can roll with respect to one another so as to describe a helical path. 
As a result, the planet wheel (3, 65) and the sun wheel are given a 

different position with respect to one another in the axial direction, which 
produces a different transmission ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a continuously variable transmission, 
comprising a driving sun wheel (11, 66), at least one planet wheel (3, 65) 
having a double, essentially conical surface (30, 31, 64, 71, 72), which 
planet wheel (3, 65) interacts on one side with the sun wheel (11, 66) and 
on the other side with an annulus wheel (2, 73), as well as adjusting means 
(5, 6, 16) for changing the transmission ratio. A transmission of this type, which is particularly suitable for 
a bicycle, is disclosed in NL-A-9001390. The disadvantage of this known 
transmission is that the adjustment thereof under torque loading is not 
possible and that the efficiency at high transmission ratios is poor. The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide a transmission 
of the abovementioned type which does not have said disadvantages. This aim 
is achieved in that each planet wheel (3, 65) is provided with an 
intermediate wheel (9, 59) which interacts on one side with the sun wheel 
(11, 66) and on the other side with said planet wheel (3, 65). Preferably, 
a multiplicity of planet wheels are employed, each planet wheel having an 
associated intermediate wheel; six may be mentioned as an example. The intermediate wheel has a threefold effect. Firstly, the 
intermediate wheel makes it possible to achieve helical travel in the 
contact between the planet wheel and the intermediate wheel, as a result of 
which the planet can assume a different axial position under load; secondly, 
the intermediate wheel ensures that the input shaft and the output shaft 
have the same direction of rotation; and, thirdly, the combination of sun 
and intermediate wheel makes it possible to achieve an intermediate 
transmission, as a result of which an advantageous chain drive can be 
chosen, especially for a bicycle. In connection with the provision of various transmission ratios, 
each planet wheel (3, 65) and, where appropriate, intermediate wheel (9, 59) 
is adjustable about an imaginary axis which runs transversely to the centre 
line of the sun wheel (11, 66), such that each planet wheel (3, 65) and the 
annulus wheel (2, 59) can be brought into positions in which they can roll 
with respect to one another so as to describe a helical path. As the planet 
wheels roll so as to describe a helical path with respect to the annulus 
wheel, said planet wheels are moved in the axial direction with respect to 
the sun wheel, which movement results in a change in the transmission ratio. In order to make said movement possible, each planet wheel
