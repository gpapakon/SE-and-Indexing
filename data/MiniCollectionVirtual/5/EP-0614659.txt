<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with new formulations of orally 
active pharmaceutical agents and a device for administration 
thereof. More particularly this invention is concerned with 
formulations in semisolid form for oral administration of 
pharmaceutical agents used for systemic treatment, preferably 
contained in a single dose packet or in a multi-dose measuring 
device which can be used to measure as well as to administer the 
formulation, and to a childproof closure useful for the device. Heretofore, pharmaceutical agents for systemic treatment by 
oral administration have generally been formulated in solid form 
as pills or capsules or in liquid form. Children, the elderly and 
people with motor problems often have problems swallowing pills 
and capsules. It is also difficult to administer medicine in 
liquid form to children, even when the liquid has been thickened 
to a syrup, and the elderly and those with motor problems also 
have difficulty with the self administration of liquid, 
especially when it is necessary to measure a specific unit dose.  Important requirements for a non-solid pharmaceutical 
formulation for oral administration include palatability to 
children and adults, stability, i.e. a long shelf life, 
compatibility of formulation components with active agent and 
desirably, ease of administration of the required dose. Pharmaceutical preparations in semisolid form for topical 
application are well known in the art. Such preparations include 
gels, pastes, creams and ointments for use on the skin, teeth and 
mucous membranes. Antacids and anti-ulcer agents in suspension 
and gel form for coating the mucous lining of the stomach are 
also well known in the art. In a few instances, systemically useful pharmaceutical 
agents have been incorporated into gelled vehicles, as for 
example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,305,933, 4,576,645 
and 4,883,660. However, these vehicles all suffer from one or 
more disadvantages, such as the presence of a component which is 
undesirable for administration to children and/or is incompatible 
with many pharmaceutical agents, the presence of an emulsion 
which is difficult to manufacture and tends to be unstable and/or 
inadequate viscosity. There is a need for an economical formulation of systemic 
pharmaceutical agents in easily administered form, as well as a 
need for easily administered non-spill pharmaceutical  
 
formulations which can be measured and administered effortlessly 
to children and by adults with motor problems. There is also

carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, 
tragacanth, acacia, pectin, gelatin, polyethylene glycol and carbomer in an amount 

effective to provide Brookfield a viscosity of about 2500 to 70,000 cps and a 
consistency which allows the composition to be squeezed easily through an orifice of 

about 0.1 mm to 5 mm in diameter; sweetener, preservative and optionally, 
flavouring matter, colouring matter, buffer, sodium chloride and solubilising agent 

for the orally active pharmaceutical agent.

pharmaceutical agent is selected from a member of the group consisting of an 

analgesic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, antihistamine, cough suppressant, 
expectorant, bronchodilator, anti-infective, CNS active drug, cardiovascular drug, 

antineoplastic, cholesterol-lowering drug, anti-emetic, vitamin, mineral supplement 
and fecal softener. 
The pharmaceutical composition according to Claim 1, in which the pharmaceutical 
agent is selected from a member of the group consisting of acetaminophen, aspirin, 

ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, pseudoephedrine, 
caridopamm leviidopa, terfenadine, ranitidine, ciprofloxacin, triazolam, fluconazole, 

acyclovir, fluoxetine, enalpril, diltiazem, lovastatin and a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt or ester thereof. 
The pharmaceutical composition according to any preceding claim which is contained 
in a single dose packet. 
A device for containing and measuring a unit dose of a pharmaceutical composition 
in semisolid
 form comprising a squeezable container for holding the pharmaceutical 
composition having an outlet defining a flow channel for delivering said composition 

from the container, and closure means adapted to be connected to the outlet, the 
closure means comprising a spoon-shaped element having a shaft with channel means 

connected thereto so that the bowl of the spoon-shaped element projects from the 
closure means and the channel means are in fluid communication with the flow 

channel of the squeezable container and sealing means in said closure means 
positioned to seal the container when the closure means is fully closed and to provide 

space for the contents of the container to flow through the channel means into the 
spoon-shaped element in response to pressure on the container when the closure 

means is partially opened, whereby contents of the squeezable container can be 
squeezed into the bowl of the spoon-shaped element and administered therefrom. 
A device for containing and measuring a unit dose of a pharmaceutical composition 
in semisolid form comprising a squeezable container for holding the pharmaceutical 

composition having an open neck with threads for attaching a cap thereto and a cap 
with threads suitable to engage the threads of the neck of the squeezable container, 

a spoon having a shaft with channel means fixed in the cap so that the bowl-shaped 
end of the spoon projects outside the cap and the shaft projects into the cap and the 

channel means are in alignment with the open neck of the squeezable container and 
sealing means in said cap positioned to seal the container when the cap is fully closed
