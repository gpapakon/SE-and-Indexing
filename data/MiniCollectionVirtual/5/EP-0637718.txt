<ABSTRACT>
A lighting lamp comprises two bulbs (16, 18) inserted in an electrical circuit (20) having a common control component (42), the assembly being carried by a support plate (14) made of insulating material. The control component (42) is equipped with a switching bar (58) having two actuation cams (68, 70) interacting alternately with contact blades (92, 120) constituting the first and the second switches (46, 48). A mechanical latch (62) makes it possible to lock the control component (42) in the inactive position. An adjusting button (50) is intended to focus the light beam emitted by the first bulb (16).

An electric lighting lamp with double light source housed in a case (12), and 
containing : 


a first bulb (16) fitted in a first connecting base (38), 
a second bulb (18) fitted in a second connecting base (40), and extending parallel 
to the first bulb (16), 
an electrical circuit (20) equipped with a control device (42) of two switches (46, 
48), which are connected respectively in series with said first and second bulbs (16, 

18), 
a reflector (26) and transparent screen (29) element for transmission of the light 
beam emitted by each of said bulbs (16, 18), 
a plate (14) of insulating material for supporting the two connecting bases (38, 40) 
and the electrical circuit (20), 
a switching bar (58) of said control device (42) having two actuating means (68, 
70) staggered along a transverse axis (59), and cooperating alternatively with 

contact strips (92, 120) constituting the first and second switches (46, 48) to control 
extinction or lighting of the light bulbs (16, 18) depending on whether the control 

device (42) is in a break position or an active position, 
 
characterized in that : 


said plate (14) subdivides the inside of the case (12) into a first front compartment 
(12a) receiving the bulbs (16, 18), and a second rear compartment (12b) housing 

the electrical circuit (20), 
said switching bar (58) is mounted in the second compartment (12b) with rotation 
in a bearing (44) on one of the side faces of the case (12) on the same side as the 

second fixed-focus bulb (18), 
an adjustment knob (50) is arranged at the opposite of the control device (42) for 
moving the first connecting base (38) to focus the light beam emitted by the first bulb 

(16), 
and the electrical circuit (20) comprises a plurality of contact elements (76, 78, 80) 
in the form of interconnected blades, having at least one deformable connection 

zone (96, 110, 118) arranged between the first movable connecting base (38) and 
the two movable contact strips (92, 120) of the switches (46, 48) to ensure electrical 

continuity when the adjustment knob (50) is rotated. 
The lighting lamp according to claim 1, characterized in that a mechanical locking 
means (62) is associated to the control device (42) to lock the latter in the break 

position. 
The lighting lamp according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the switching 
bar (58) is appreciably aligned with a pinion (56) of the adjustment knob (50) in the 

direction of the transverse axis (59), and that the pinion (56) cooperates with a drive 
part with crown-wheel (54) securedly united to the first base (38), which is moved in 

limited translation when the adjustment knob (50) is rotated. 
The lighting lamp according to claim 1 characterized in that the control device 
(42) comprises a lever or handle (60) coupled to the switching bar (58) and capable 

of occupying selectively three distinct angular positions, said break position being 
situated half-way between the two active end-of-travel positions. 
The lighting lamp according to claim 4, characterized in that the mechanical 
locking means (62) is formed by a latch associated to the gripping handle (60), and 

that in the break position the latch can be depressed to a locked position to perform 
locking in rotation of the switching bar (58) due to the locking effect of the handle 

(60). 
The lighting lamp according to claim 1, characterized in that the electrical circuit 
(20) comprises : 


a first contact element (76) comprising an end (82) having a first self-baring 
contact (84), connected to a first intermediate contact strip (86) in engagement with 

one of the pins (41) of the second bulb (18) and to a second contact strip (88) 
forming part of the first switch (46), 
a second contact element (78) equipped with an earth ring (90) in contact with the 
bottom of the first bulb (16), and a third contact strip (92) cooperating with the 

second contact strip (88) to form said first switch (46), 
and a third contact element (80) provided with a fourth contact strip (106) in 
permanent contact with the isolated terminal of the first bulb (16), with a bracket 

(114) having a second self-baring contact (116), and with a fifth contact strip (120) 
forming part of the second switch (48) at the level of the fixed second base (40). 
The lighting lamp according to claim 6, characterized in that the conductors (130, 
132) of the power supply cable (34) are connected to the electrical circuit (20) by  

 
inserting the first and third contact strips (76), (80) respectively in the first and 

second self-baring contacts (84), (106). 
The lighting lamp according to claim 1, characterized in that the first switch (46) is 

connected in the earth ring circuit (90) of the first bulb (16), and that the second 
switch (48) is connected in a branch of the circuit (20) of opposite polarity for supply 

of the second bulb (18). 
The lighting lamp according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 
plate (14) is positioned on a plurality of guiding studs (36) cast with the case (12), 

each stud being formed by a leg fixed to the base plate of the case (12), and
