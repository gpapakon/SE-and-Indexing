<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to armoured glass, in particular for motor vehicles, consisting of several sheets of silicate glass joined to each other via interlayers of thermoplastic polymer and of a film or sheet of impact-resistant plastic which is applied with the aid of a layer of thermoplastic adhesive to that surface of the armoured glass which is facing towards the passenger compartment in the installed state and which is provided on its free surface with a scratch-resistant coating, a sheet of silicate glass (1; 14; 17), placed in front of the film or sheet (6) of impact-resistant plastic towards the outside, being provided with a layer (10, 15, 20) which reflects thermal radiation.

Armoured window, particularly for cars and constituted by several
silicate glass sheets joined to one another by intermediate, thermoplastic

polymer coatings and a sheet or plate of impact-resistant plastics material
applied with the aid of a thermoplastic adhesive coating to the surface of

the armoured window turned towards the passenger compartment in the installed
state and provided on its free surface with a scoring-resistant layer,


characterized in that
 a silicate glass sheet (1, 14, 17) placed in front of
the impact-resistant, plastics material sheet or plate (6) towards the

outside is provided with a thermal radiation reflecting coating (10, 15, 20).
Armoured window according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the thermal
radiation reflecting coating (10) is applied to the outermost of the silicate

glass sheets (1, 2, 3) joined to one another by intermediate, thermoplastic
coatings (4, 5) on the face contiguous to the intermediate coating (4).
Armoured window according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the thermal
radiation reflecting coating (15, 20) is applied to another glass sheet (14,

16) which, with an air space (13) on the side of the armoured window (12)
directed towards the outside, is joined to the latter by means of a spacing

frame.
Armoured window according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said other
glass sheet (14) is a thermally tempered safety window provided on its face

directed towards the intermediate air space (13) of the thermal radiation
reflecting coating (15).
Armoured window according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the other
glass sheet is a laminated glass window (16) formed from two glass sheets

(17, 18) and an intermediate thermoplastic coating (19) and is provided with
the thermal radiation reflecting coating (20) on a surface contiguous to the

intermediate, thermoplastic coating (19) of one of the glass sheets (17, 18).
Armoured window according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in that
 the thermal radiation reflecting coating (10, 15, 20) is a multiple
coating having a metal oxide-silver-metal oxide structure.
Armoured window according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
in that
 the thermal radiation reflecting coating (10, 15, 20) is terminated
in the peripheral region spaced from the edge of the sheet and 
in that
 the
connection of the coated glass sheet (1, 14, 17) to the adjacent glass sheet

(2, 1, 18) is ensured by the intermediate, adhesive coating (2, 19) or by the 
adhesive sealing mass of the spacing window on the periphery beside the

thermal radiation reflecting coating (10, 15, 20).
Armoured window according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
in that
 the impact-resistant, plastics material sheet or plate (6) is of
polycarbonate and its free surface is coated with a flexible, elastic,

scoring-resistant coating (18) of polyurethane having self-repair properties.
