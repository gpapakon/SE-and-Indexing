<ABSTRACT>
Access of a user to a resource, such as a 
telecommunications network, includes storing, in a first 

call data base, a first set of attributes concerning an 
ongoing call from a caller. A second call data base 

stores a second set of attributes concerning the history 
of prior calls made by the caller. A rules data base 

stores rules concerning attributes for determining whether 
to disconnect the call, block future calls, or take other 

action. A determination is made whether data in at least 
one of the call data bases matches the rules in the rules 

data base. The call is then disconnected, the next call 
blocked, or other action is taken, in response to a match 

between data the call data bases and data in the rules 
data base. Preferably, the second call data base is 

updated in response to matches with the rules data base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to preventing fraudulent 
access to a resource, and particularly to methods and 
means for blocking or disconnecting telephone calls, in 
real time, from callers that are attempting to gain 
fraudulent access to telephone networks. Fraudulent telephone calls are a major source of 
revenue loss to telephone service providers. They also 
result in customer dissatisfaction when tolls are 
inadvertently charged to the subscriber as a result of 
fraudulently placed calls. Present systems use batch mode 
analysis of call details and sometimes manage to detect 
some types of fraud. This arrangement requires the 
telephone company to communicate with the culprit to end 
the abuse. It entails a delay in the prevention of fraud. An object of the invention is to overcome the 
disadvantages of prior systems. Another object of the invention is to detect and  
 
block or disconnect fraudulent access demands in real 
time. According to a feature of the invention, these 
objects are attained by storing, in a control data base, a 
set of attributes concerning an access from an access 
demand source; maintaining a rules data base of rules 
concerning attributes for determining corrective action; 
determining whether data the control data base matches the 
rules in the rules data base; and effecting corrective 
action by disconnecting the access during access time in 
response to a match between data in the control data base 
and data in the rules data base. According to another feature of the invention. 
storing in the control data base includes storing in a 
first access data base a first set of attributes 
concerning the ongoing access. According to another feature of the invention, 
storing in the control data base includes storing in a 
second access data base a second set of attributes 
concerning the history of prior accesses made by the 
access demand source; the step of determining whether data 
the access data base matches the rules in the rules data 
base includes determining whether to disconnect the 
access, block future accesses, or take other action; and 
the step of effecting corrective action includes 
disconnecting the access, blocking future accesses, or 
taking other action. According to another feature of the invention, 
the second access data base is updated on the basis of the 
matches. These and other features of the invention are 
pointed out in the claims. Other objects and advantages 
of the invention will be evident from the following  
 
detailed description when read in
