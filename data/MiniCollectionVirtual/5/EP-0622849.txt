<ABSTRACT>
A structure of an electronic device having a 
predetermined unidirectional conduction threshold, 

being formed on a chip of an N-semiconductor material, 
comprises a plurality of isolated N-regions (16a-c), 

each bounded laterally by an isolating region (15a-c) 
and at the bottom by two buried P- and N-regions which 

form in combination a junction with a predetermined 
reverse conduction threshold, and means 

(15a,18,17b,15b,17c) of connecting the junctions of the 
various isolated regions serially together in the same 

conduction sense; the buried N-region of the first 
junction (Z1) in the series is connected to a common 

electrode (C), which also is one terminal of the 
device, over an internal path (R) of the N-material of 

the chip, and the buried P-region of the last junction 
(Zn) in the ser
ies contains an additional buried 
N-region (14d) which is connected electrically to a 

second terminal (18a) of the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monolithic
semiconductor integrated circuit structures, and in
particular to a device having a predetermined
unidirectional conduction threshold which is especially
adapted to protect a power transistor integrated to
said structure against overvoltages.Transistors, whether of the bipolar or
field-effect types, are frequently used as switches to
supply a load with switching currents which may be
quite large. Especially where the transistor load is an
inductive one, the switch breaking, that is the sudden
transition from the conduction state to the cutoff
state of the transistor, brings about a transient
situation of overvoltage across the power terminals of
the transistor, that is between its collector and
emitter in the instance of a bipolar transistor or
between its drain and source terminals in the instance
of a field-effect transistor. This overvoltage may be
several times higher than the transistor supply voltage
and attain such values and durations as to exceed safe
limits set by the structural characteristics of the
transistor, to the point that the transistor may be
destroyed.A known practice for protecting a bipolar 
transistor in such circumstances is to connect, between
the collector and the base of the transistor, a device
with a predetermined unidirectional conduction
threshold, such as a Zener diode having a lower reverse
breakdown voltage than the breakdown voltage between
the transistor collector and emitter, with the base
open or floating, referred to as BVceo. As the
collector/emitter voltage increases due to the
transition from the conduction to the cutoff state up
to the reverse conduction value of the Zener, a current
is injected into the transistor base. The latter is,
therefore, restored to conduction and discharges the
energy stored in the inductive load on itself. Of
course, the transistor should be sized to absorb such
energy harmlessly. The maximum overvoltage between the
collector and the emitter would equal here the
breakdown or reverse conduction threshold voltage of
the Zener diode plus the transistor base/emitter
forward voltage.A similar device to the above-described one
is used to protect a field-effect power transistor,
such as a vertical MOSFET, against overvoltages across
the source and drain terminals. But in this case the
structure is somewhat different, because a diode with
opposite polarity from that of the Zener diode must be 
connected in series with the Zener diode connected
between the gate and drain terminals. In fact, the gate
termin
