<ABSTRACT>
A multilevel code communication equipment 
includes a transmission unit and a reception unit. The 

transmission unit includes a first converting unit, a 
first encoding unit, a first differential encoding unit, 

a second encoding unit, a mapping unit, and a modulating 
unit. The reception unit includes a demodulating unit, 

a first decoding unit, an inverting unit, a phase 
shifting unit, a second decoding unit, a differential 

decoding unit, a decision unit, and a second converting 
unit. The first converting unit distributes an input 

serial digital signal to a plurality of levels 
containing a level 1 indicating a level which is 

transparent to a 90° phase ambiguity, and a level 2 
indicating a level which is transparent to a 180° phase 

rotation. The second converting unit receives outputs 
from the inverting unit, the differential decoding unit, 

and the decision unit, multiplexes the received signals 
into a serial digital signal, and outputs the serial 

digital signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is used in multilevel
coded modulation to be applied to 2m-value quadrature
amplitude modulation (m ≥ 4, m: integer). The present
invention relates to a multilevel code communication
equipment capable of performing correct decoding
constantly even if a phase ambiguity exists.Although the present invention is developed
for microwave radio, it can be extensively used in
communications other than microwave radio.Recently, introduction of error-correcting
schemes with high correcting capabilities has been
advanced in a digital microwave radio system for the
purpose of improving the quality of transmission
characteristics. Coded modulation has been studied as
one of these schemes.The coded modulation is a combination of
mapping based on set partitioning and error-correction
coding techniques, and is an error-correcting scheme
superior in performance to conventional error-correcting
schemes which are independent of modulation/demodulation
techniques. Code construction methods are classified
into multilevel coded modulation and trellis coded 
modulation (TCM). The multilevel coded modulation is
described in detail in H. Imai, S. Hirakawa, "A New
Multilevel Coding Method Using Error-Correction Codes",
IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. IT-23, pp. 371-377. The
details of the TCM are described in Ungerboeck,
"Trellis-Coded Modulation with Redundant Signal Sets
Part 1,2", IEEE Com. Mag., vol. 25, pp. 5-21, Feb. 1987.
Since the principle of the error correction is not
related directly to the gist of the present invention, a
detailed description thereof will be omitted.It is impossible for quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) used in digital microwave radio to
detect an absolute phase of a carrier on a receiving
side, and so a 90° phase ambiguity exists. Generally,
differential decoding is used to eliminate the influence
of this phase ambiguity. Since, however, errors are
doubled by this differential decoding, an
error-correcting circuit is placed inside the
differential decoding. Therefore, an error-correcting
scheme for use in the QAM is required to have
characteristics not influenced by this phase ambiguity.
Codes meeting this condition are called transparent
codes.A code having the highest correcting
capability in the TCM, i.e., a so-called Ungerboeck code
is not transparent to 90° and 180° phase ambiguities.
The code therefore cannot be correctly decoded except 
when it is demodulated with the same phase as that on a
transmitting side. For this reason, however, an
absolute phase can be
