<ABSTRACT>
A heat-resistant composite sheet is composed as the 
main constituents, either of a foamed polystyrene sheet and 

a polybutylene terephthalate resin film, or of a foamed 
polystyrene sheet, a polystyrene resin film and a 

polybutylene terephthalate resin film, wherein the 
polybutylene terephthalate resin film layer is laminated to 

form both or one of the outer layers. The composite sheet 
can be formed into a container with excellent heat resistant 

properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-resistant 
composite sheet and a heat-resistant container made of this 
sheet. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a composite sheet for a heat-resistant container, which can 
withstand heating in a microwave oven or the like without 
detriment to the taste or flavour of the food cooked therein 
and which retains excellent heat insulation after the 
heating and also to a heat-resistant container made of this 
composite sheet. European patent application EP-A-128425 (Fukuyama 
Pearl Shiko KK) describes a food packaging container which 
can withstand heating in a microwave oven. It is formed of 
a laminate sheet material comprising a non-stretched 
polyethylene terephthalate film or sheet laminated on the 
interior side of a foamed polystyrene sheet. Containers made of a foamed polystyrene sheet having 
excellent properties in light weight, heat resistance, 
rigidity and buffering having been extensively used as 
containers for fast foods such as hamburgers, fried chicken  
 
and pre-packed lunches and as containers for instant foods 
such as precooked Chinese noodles and soup mix. These 
containers are prepared by heat-forming of a foamed 
polystyrene sheet alone or a composite sheet comprising a 
laminate of a foamed polystyrene sheet and other resin 
film. Since, however, these containers have various 
defects, they are not fully satisfactory as food 
containers. More specifically, since a foamed polystyrene 
sheet alone or a composite sheet composed of a polystyrene 
resin film and a foamed polystyrene sheet has poor heat 
resistance, a food packaged in a container made thereof 
cannot be directly heated for cooking in a microwave oven, 
and because of an inherent smell of polystyrene, its use is 
considerably limited. Although a composite sheet comprising 
a laminate of a foamed polystyrene sheet with a polyethylene 
resin film or polypropylene resin film is improved in heat 
resistance to some extent over the above-mentioned laminate 
sheet, the heat resistance is insufficient to withstand the 
temperatures, often exceeding 100°C, imposed on a container 
of an oily food when heated in a microwave oven. Moreover, 
the above-mentioned olefins have a strong, so-called 
olefinic smell so that they might impair the taste or 
flavour of the food unfavorably. A composite sheet composed 
of a foamed polystyrene sheet and a non-oriented 
polyethylene terephthalate film is advantageous in that the  
 
taste and flavor of the food are not impaired, but
