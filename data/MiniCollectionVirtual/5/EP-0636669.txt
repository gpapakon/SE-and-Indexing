<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiation curable 
binder composition for powder paint formulations. The 

binder composition comprises 

a) a polymer having a degree of unsaturation between 300 
and 1800 grams per mole of unsaturated group (WPU), 

having a molecular weight Mn between 800 and 6800 
and a viscosity between 1 dPas and 800 dPas and 
b) a crosslinking agent having vinyl ether, vinyl ester 
or (meth)acrylate functional groups. 
The polymer is an unsaturated polyester and/or 
an unsaturated polyacrylate. 
The binder composition can be used in the 
preparation of powder paint formulations which can be 

applied to heat-sensitive substrates such as wood and 
plastic and which can be cured with UV or electron beam 

radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radiation curable
binder composition which can be used in the preparation of
powder paint formulations for application on heat-sensitive
substrates.As appears from the article "Overview of the
powder coatings market worldwide" by G. Maggiore in
Pitture e Vernice Europe 1/92, pp 15-22, the search is
ongoing to discover powder paint formulations in which
curing causes only a minor thermal load on the substrate
and therefore is suited for heat-sensitive substrates such
as wood, plastic or construction elements.It was also stated in the recent 1993 lecture
"Radiation curing of powder coating" by Dr. Wittig at the
Radtech Europe 1993 Conference (2-6 May 1993), that
radiation curable binder compositions (a binder
composition is the combination of a resin with a
crosslinker) are not yet commercially available.Specifically, there has been a long-felt need to
develop powder coatings that have the desired combination
of good shelf life at relatively high temperatures (such
as, for example, about 40°C) on the one hand and a
sufficiently low viscosity at a relatively low curing
temperature at which curing can take place (so as to
attain good flow) on the other.The object of the invention is to provide a
binder composition for powder coatings having a long shelf
life at temperatures of, for instance, about 40°C and
lower, a good processability and flow behaviour at
temperatures of between, for example, 80°C and 140°C, and
the ability to be cured with radiation so that application 
of powder paint formulations to heat-sensitive substrates,
such as wood.The term wood as a substrate includes fibre
board, MDF (medium density fibre board) or any substrate
for of which a significant proportion consists of wood.The invention is characterized in that the
binder composition comprises
a) a polymer having a degree of unsaturation between
about 300 and 1800 grams per mole of unsaturated
group (WPU), having a molecular weight Mn between
about 800 and 6800 and a viscosity of between 1 dPas
and 800 dPas, andb) a crosslinking agent having at least two vinyl ether or vinyl ester
functional groups per molecule.Mn is determined from gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) using a polystyrene standard.The viscosity of the polymer is measured with an
Emila rheometer at 165°C (as described at page 187 of
Misev, Powder Coatings, Chemistry and Technology, Wiley
1991).Some of the advantages of this invention - long
shelf life at 40°C, the ability to be radiation curable,
and good flow behavior at temperatures between
