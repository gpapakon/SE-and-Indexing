<ABSTRACT>
Intelligent data storing apparatus for use in a control system comprising at least one programmable logic controller (PLC) for controlling one or more devices to perform a process, the process having a number of variants. The apparatus comprises means for receiving a data request including a code designating a process variant and a code indicative of one or more designated devices requiring control in order to implement the process variant; a database dictionary defining a tree structure relating operational data elements to particular variants of the process and particular devices; and means for retrieving operational data elements from the database using pathnames corresponding to the tree structure specified in the database dictionary and for formatting the retrieved data into a block having a predetermined structure for outputting to the PLC.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
machine control and, more particularly to the control of
paint spraying machines and the like.For the purposes of illustration the following
description has been given in terms of paint application
in the automotive industry. It is to be understood that
the invention is of wider applicability as described
further below.Fig 1 gives an overview of a typical example
of the paint application section ("booth") of a vehicle
production plant, in diagrammatic form. The booth
usually includes a number of "stations" each containing
a set of machines. For example, station A shown in Fig.
1 contains eleven painting machines. Each station may
be considered to be made up of a number of "zones". For
example, in station A the pair of painting machines 101
and 201 which face one another across the conveyor may
be treated as defining a zone, Z1, Similarly, the paint
guns 301, 302 and 303, provided on a roof machine, may
be treated as defining a zone, Z5. According to the
present invention any combination of bells, stonechip,
sill spray and manual hand colour stations can be used
in each zone, it is freely configurable. A vehicle body
1 (here a car) to be painted is moved through the
various zones and stations by a conveyor 3 (typically a
pair of moving tracks in the floor).Modern vehicle production plants cater for the
manufacture of a number of different vehicle body styles
painted in a range of colours. Successive vehicle
bodies passing through a booth may be of different body
styles and may require painting in different colours.
In order that the relevant vehicle body style and colour
can be determined it is usual for each body to have an 
ident code etched on it. As a vehicle body enters the
booth its ident code is read by an optical system OP1.
The ident code information is fed from the optical
system OP1 to one or more programmable logic controllers
(PLCs) controlling the paint application process in the
booth. The PLC sets up the painting machines and
ancillary equipment ready to begin painting the vehicle
body when it enters the first station. Meanwhile the
body is conveyed between a pair of substantially upright
duster rollers DR1 for removing dust and particles from
the surface of the body by physically brushing them away
and applying a voltage. The duster DR1 may also serve
to deionise the vehicle body, or a separate deioniser
may be provided.As is well known, such PLCs are "off the peg"
devices generally designed to be able to control a wide
range of machines

<CLAIMS>
Intelligent data storing apparatus for use in a control system
comprising at least one programmable
 logic controller PLC adapted to
control one or more devices to perform a process, the process having a

number of variants, the apparatus comprising:

receiving means for receiving a data request from said PLC, said
data request including (i) a code designating one of said variants of said

process and (ii) a code indicative of one or more designated ones of said
devices requiring control in order to implement said variant; and
database means comprising a database holding operational data
elements;

   characterized in that said database means further comprises a
database dictionary defining (a) a tree structure relating operational data

elements to particular ones of said variants of the process and particular ones
of said devices and (b) the structure of one or more cycles by which each

device performs the process, the structure of the or each cycle being constant
regardless of which variant of said process is designated; and


the database holds the operational data elements grouped into
files corresponding to particular combinations of device, process variant and

cycle; and by further comprising
retrieving means, responsive to said receiving means, and
arranged to identify the applicable cycle(s), to retrieve operational data

elements from files in the database applicable to the designated device,
process variant and cycle(s) using pathnames corresponding to the tree

structure specified in the database dictionary and to format the retrieved data
elements into a block having a predetermined structure for outputting to the

PLC.
Intelligent data storing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the retrieving means is adapted to format the retrieved data into blocks of

data, each block comprising operational data elements required by the
designated device to execute a cycle of said variant of the process.
Intelligent data storing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the database dictionary definition of cycle structure includes a flag indicating

when a cycle is common to a number of devices, and the retrieving means is
adapted to detect the flag and, when required, to retrieve the operational data

elements relating to that cycle from the same file in the database whichever of
said number of devices is designated.
Intelligent data storing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the database dictionary definition of cycle structure includes a flag indicating

when a cycle is common to a number of variants of said process, and the
retrieving means is adapted to detect the flag and, when required, to retrieve

database whichever of said number of variants of said process is designated.
Intelligent data storing apparatus according to any previous
claim, wherein the data request code indicative of one or more designated

image representing the physical disposition of the one or more devices to be

controlled; and
means for overlaying a stored representation of the object over
said image at a location corresponding to the location of the object as

determined from the PLC.
Intelligent data storing apparatus according to any previous
claim adapted for use in a paint application process, wherein the variants of
