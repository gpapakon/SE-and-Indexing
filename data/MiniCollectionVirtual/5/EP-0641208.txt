<ABSTRACT>
Novel substituted 4-azasteroid 5- alpha -reductase inhibitors of formula (I), wherein A is (a), (b) or (c), are claimed as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and formulations thereof. These compounds are effective inhibitors of testosterone 5 alpha -reductase(s) and are thus useful in the treatment of a number of hyperandrogenic conditions including benign prostatic hypertrophy, acne, seborrhea, female hirsutism, and male and female pattern baldness (alopecia).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to novel urea, thiourea,
thiocarbamyl and carbamyl 4-azasteroidal 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.The art reveals that certain undesirable physiological
manifestations, such as acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, male
pattern baldness and benign prostatic hypertrophy, are the result of
hyperandrogenic stimulation caused by an excessive accumulation of
testosterone or similar androgenic hormones in the metabolic system.
Early attempts to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the
undesirable results of hyperandrogenicity resulted in the discovery of
several steroidal antiandrogens having undesirable hormonal activities
of theft own. The estrogens, for example, not only counteract the effect
of the androgens but have a feminizing effect as well. Non-steroidal
antiandrogens have also been developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'-trifluoromethyl-isobutyranilide.
See Neri, et al., Endo., Vol. 91, No. 2
(1972). However, these products, though devoid of hormonal effects,
are peripherally active, competing with the natural androgens for
receptor sites, and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host or the
male fetus of a female hostIt is now known in the art that the principal mediator of
androgenic activity in some target organs is 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and
that it is formed locally in the target organ by the action of testosterone-5α-reductase.
It is also known that inhibitors of testosterone-5α-reductase
will serve to prevent or lessen symptoms of hyperandrogenic
stimulation. A number of 4-aza steroid compounds are known in the art
that are 5α-reductase inhibitors. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos.

which are said to be useful in the treatment of DHT-related hyperandrogenic
conditions.However, despite the suggestion in the prior art that
hyperandrogenic diseases are the result of a single 5α-reductase, there
are reports regarding the presence of other 5α-reductase isozymes in
