Method of recovering components of rod-shaped 
elements from the tobacco-processing industry, the 

components being able to be paper, tobacco and/or filter 
material, for example, and the following method steps 

being carried out: 

a dispersion step, in which the elements are broken 
down in a mill (1) in a dry mechanical manner into their 

individual components, the elements, during their dispersion, 
passing through one or more radial jaws (12) of a 

rotor (14) of the mill (1), which jaws are rigidly or 
movably fastened to the rotor (14) during operation, and 

one or more stationary jaws (13) of a stator (17) of the 
mill (1), which jaws are rigidly or movably fastened 

during operation of the mill (1), and the radial jaws 
(12) and the stationary jaws (13), when they are opposite 

one another, being spaced apart radially from each other, 
and 
a subsequent separation step, in which the individual 
components are separated from one another. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that during the separation step the paper is sucked up 

after screening out the tobacco. 
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that during the separation step the components 

are screened several times. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that during the separation step the components 

are blown with a gas, in particular with air. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that during the separation step the components 

are set vibrating along an oblique plane which is 
inclined to the horizontal. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the inclination of the oblique plane to the horizontal 

has an angle (a) in the range between about 4째 and 
12째. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized  
 

in that the tobacco screened out during the 
separation step is subjected to further screening steps. 
Device for recovering components of rod-shaped 
elements from the tobacco-processing industry, having a 

disintegration device in the form of a mill (1) which 
breaks down the elements into their individual components, 

and having a separation device which separates the 
individual components from one another,
 
the rotor (14) of the mill (1) having one or more radial 

jaws (12) which are rigidly or movably fastened to the 
rotor (14) during operation,
 
the stator (17) of the mill (1) having one or more 

stationary jaws (13) which are rigidly or movably fastened 
during operation, and
 
the radial jaws (12) and the stationary jaws (13), when 

opposite one another, being spaced apart radially from 
each other. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the spacing of the jaws (12, 13) is adjustable. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the spacing of the jaws (12, 13) is 1 to 4 mm. 
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in that the radial jaws (12) and/or the 

stationary jaws (13) are adjustable. 
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in that the separation device is constructed 

as a vibrating screen, to which the 
disintegrated components are fed from the mill (1), and 

in that the components are carried away along a plane 
inclined to the direction of the horizontal. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the vibrating screen has a plurality of screens (21, 

22) arranged one above another. 
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 13, 
characterized in that the separation device has a blower-operated 

suction device. 
Device according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the suction device (3 to 7) has a suction hood (3), 

and in that the suction hood (3) is arranged over a  
 

vibrating screen. 
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 15, 
characterized in that the separation device has a blowing 

device which blows on the disintegrated waste material or 
the components in a vibrating screen. 
Device according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the blowing device is designed as a nozzle bar (9). 
Device according to Claim 17, characterized in 
that the nozzle bar (9) is arranged in the region underneath 

the suction hood (3) of the suction device, the 
screen (21) extending between the suction hood (3) and 

the nozzle bar (9). 
Device according to one of Claims 14 to 18, 
characterized in that the suction device has a separation 

device, such as a deflection separator (5), for example. 
Device according to one of Claims 12 to 19, 
characterized in that the vibrating screen is inclined to 

the horizontal at an angle (a) of 4째 to 12째.
