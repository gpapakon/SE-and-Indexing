<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a compound of the formula: 

wherein A is a phenyl group or a heterocyclic group, said 
phenyl group and said heterocyclic group being optionally 

substituted with not more than three substituents, which 
comprises reacting a compound of the formula: 


with an aryl halide in the presence of a base. The 
resulting compound (A) is useful as a fungicide. There is

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing alkoxyiminoacetamide 
derivatives useful as fungicides, particularly 
in the agricultural field, and an intermediate therefor. Various alkoxyiminoacetic acid derivatives having 
a diaryl ether group are known to exert biological activities 
including fungicidal activity, herbicidal activity, 
etc. For instance, some phenoxyphenylalkoxyiminoacetic 
esters are disclosed to exert fungicidal activity in 
JP-A-63-23852 and JP-A-63-30463, some phenoxyphenyl-alkoxyiminoacetamides 
are disclosed to have herbicidal 
activity in JP-A-55-35006 and JP-A-56-29560, and some 
pyridyloxyphenyl-alkoxyiminoacetamides are disclosed to show 
herbicidal activity in JP-A-56-55368. However, the relationship 
between a chemical structure and a biological 
activity has not sufficiently been clarified so that it is 
still hardly possible to predict the biological activity to 
be exerted by a chemical compound from its chemical 
structure. Furthermore, EP-A-23 891 discloses herbicidal compounds 
which are related to the fungicidal compounds of the present invention, 
namely compounds wherein the -OCH2- linking group is replaced 
by -O-, and A is 2-pyridyl. Also, EP-A-253 213 discloses a group of esters which may 
be considered to be related to the compounds of this invention, 
said prior compounds also having fungicidal activity.  As the result of an extensive study on alkoxyiminoacetic 
acid derivatives having a diaryl ether group, it 
has been found that a group of alkoxyiminoacetamides of the 
following formula show a strong fungicidal activity against 
a wide variety of fungi, particularly phyto-pathogenic 
fungi:   
wherein
 
   A represents an unsaturated hydrocarbon 
group, a halogen-substituted unsaturated hydrocarbon group, 
a phenyl group or a heterocyclic group, said phenyl group 
or heterocylic group being optionally substituted with not 
more than three substituents. In this specification, the term "lower" is 
used to mean a group having not more than 8 carbon 
atoms, preferably not more than 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, 
the term "lower alkyl" means an alkyl group having not 
more than 6 carbon atoms, more preferably not more than 4 
carbon atoms (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 
isobutyl, t-butyl). The term "cyclo(lower)alkyl" means a  
 
cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 6 
atoms (e.g. cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl). Preferably, 
the term "lower alkoxy" means an alkoxy group having not more 
than 6 carbon
