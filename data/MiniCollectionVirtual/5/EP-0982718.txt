<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved heat mode
recording material based on a thin metallic layer.In a particular type of heat mode recording materials
information is recorded by creating differences in reflection and/or
in transmission on the recording layer. The recording layer has high
optical density and absorbs radiation beams which impinge thereon.
The conversion of radiation into heat brings about a local
temperature rise, causing a thermal change such as evaporation or
ablation to take place in the recording layer. As a result, the
irradiated parts of the recording layer are totally or partially
removed, and a difference in optical density is formed between the
irradiated parts and the unirradiated parts (cf. US Pat. Nos.
4,216,501, 4,233,626, 4,188,214 and 4,291,119 and British Pat. No.
2,026,346)The recording layer of such heat mode recording materials is
usually made of metals, dyes, or polymers. Recording materials like
this are described in 'Electron, Ion and Laser Beam Technology", by
M. L. Levene et al.; The Proceedings of the Eleventh Symposium
(1969); "Electronics" (Mar. 18, 1968), P. 50; "The Bell System
Technical Journal", by D. Maydan, Vol. 50 (1971), P. 1761; and
"Science", by C. O. Carlson, Vol. 154 (1966), P. 1550.Recording on such thermal recording materials is usually
accomplished by converting the information to be recorded into
electrical time series signals and scanning the recording material
with a laser beam which is modulated in accordance with the signals.
This method is advantageous in that recording images can be
obtained on real time (i.e. instantaneously). Recording materials of
this type are called "direct read after write" (DRAW) materials.
DRAW recording materials can be used as a medium for recording an
imagewise modulated laser beam to produce a human readable or
machine readable record. Human readable records are e.g. micro-images 
that can be read on enlargement and projection. An example of
a machine readable DRAW recording material is the optical disc. To
date for the production of optical discs tellurium and its alloys
have been used most widely to form highly reflective thin metal
films wherein heating with laser beam locally reduces reflectivity
by pit formation (ref. e.g. the periodical 'Physik in unserer Zeit',
15. Jahrg. 1984/Nr. 5, 129-130 the article "Optische Datenspeicher"
by Jochen Fricke). Tellurium is toxic and has poor archival
properties because of its sensitivity to oxygen and humidity. Other
metals suited for use in DRAW heat-mode
