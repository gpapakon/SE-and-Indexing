<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
controlling a valve timing of opening and closing exhaust 
valve and intake valve for an internal combustion engine. A conventional valve timing device is disclosed 
in the laid open publication of JP 4-194331 wherein at 
engine high speeds and engine light loads a small amount 
of overlap of open periods of the intake valve and the 
exhaust valve is required and under the engine cold 
condition the small amount of such the valve overlap is 
also required, but except these cases the large amount 
of overlap of open periods the intake valve and the 
exhaust valve is desired, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20. In the reciprocating type internal combustion 
engine having the valve timing device of the conventional 
type, the overlap of open periods of the intake valve 
and the exhaust valve allows a combustion air taken into 
a combustion chamber through the intake valve to be 
exhausted through the exhaust valve toward an exhaust 
pipe at the engine low speeds, the engine light loads 
and the engine cold, thereby reducing the engine output.  In order to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks 
encountered in the prior art, inventors of the present 
invention recognize a technical conception to minimize 
an amount of overlap of open periods of the intake valve 
and the exhaust valve at the engine cold and the engine 
low speeds, so that air intake efficiency is increased 
and at the engine high speeds gases of HC and NOx are 
reduced. Further, this conception is effective in 
improvements of engine starting performance and fuel 
consumption. A device for controlling a valve timing for an 
internal combustion engine which varies an amount of 
overlap of open periods of an intake valve and an exhaust 
valve comprises a valve timing control mechanism to 
minimize the amount of said overlap at the engine cold. 
By minimizing the amount of overlap of open periods of 
the intake valve and the exhaust valve the exhaust valve 
is closed during asuction stroke so that air taken into 
an combustion chamber is not discharged into an exhaust 
passage. The valve timing control mechanism permits to 
minimize an amount of overlap of open periods of the 
intake valve and the exhaust valve at the engine low speeds, 
so that air intaken into the combustion chamber does not 
exit to the exhaust passage because the exhaust valve 
is closed during a suction stroke.  These objects and advantages of the invention 
will become more apparent from the following description 
of the preferred
