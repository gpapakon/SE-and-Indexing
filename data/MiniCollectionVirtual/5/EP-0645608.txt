<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical type
displacement sensor for finding a physical amount such
as the amount of movement or displacement of an object
highly accurately by the utilization of the fact that
interfering light beams are modulated by diffraction
and interference occurring when light is applied to the
object.Optical type displacement sensors of this type
according to the prior art include optical encoders,
laser Doppler speed meters, laser interferometers, etc.
and these are highly accurate and have high resolving
power, but in order that they may be applied to a wider
field, compactness (a size of the order of
millimeters), higher accuracy, higher resolving power
(of the order of 0.1 µm) and high stability are
required of them. A sensor of a size of millimeters
could be directly attached to an object to be measured
for use and therefore could also be used in a compact
apparatus, but is liable to cause an attaching error
and thus, it becomes necessary to cope with it.As the prior art effective for miniaturizing in
the field of such a detecting apparatus utilizing 
light, there are the following.Figures 1A and 1B of the accompanying drawings
are illustrations of an optical encoder disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application No. 1-180615.
A light beam diverging from a light emitting
element 42 passes through an aperture 46A in a base
plate 46, is converted into a linear ray array by a
slit array 14 and is applied to a grating on a scale
40, whereupon the grating of the scale 40 is projected
onto an index grating 16 by a light beam reflected from
the bottom 12 of the scale 40, and the quantity of
light entering a light receiving element 48 on the base
plate 46 is modulated by the geometrical superposition
of the two. This is the principle of this optical
encoder. According to this principle, downsizing is
possible, but resolving power is limited.Figures 2A and 2B of the accompanying drawings
are illustrations of an optical type encoder disclosed
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 62-121314,
and this encoder is an effective example of an improved
construction for downsizing the basic optical system
(British Laid-Open Patent No. 1,474,049) of an encoder
using three diffraction gratings. A light beam
diverging from a light emitting element 51 is made into
a parallel light beam by a lens 52, and is diffracted
when it is applied to a grating GK(A) on an index scale
A, and creates light beams in three directions of 
emergence.Each light beam is diffracted by a grating
GK(B) on
