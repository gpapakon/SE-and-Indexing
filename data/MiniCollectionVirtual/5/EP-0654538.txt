<ABSTRACT>
Materials from the metallurgical industry containing zinc, lead and iron oxides are worked up by the rotary-kiln volatilising process in a rotary kiln. A mixture of these materials with sluggishly reacting, carbon-containing material is charged into the rotary kiln and thermally treated under reducing conditions. In the end zone of the rotary kiln, hot air having a temperature of from 500 to 900 DEG C is blown onto the charge, with a charge temperature of from 1200 to 1500 DEG C being set in the end zone, ZnO being largely reduced by metallic iron present in the charge and the metallic iron being largely reoxidised again at the same time. The temperature and composition of the waste gas (off gas) is set in such a way that autothermic afterburning outside the rotary kiln is possible by addition of air. The afterburned waste gas is cooled and purified.

A process for treating materials which contain
zinc, lead, and iron oxides in a Waelz process kiln

with a countercurrent flow between the charge and the
gas atmosphere, in which


a) a mixture of the materials with carbonaceous
material with low reactivity is charged as a

charge into the charging end of the Waelz process
kiln,
b) the mixture contains the carbonaceous material in
an amount which is at least stoichiometrically

sufficient to reduce the Zn and Pb contained in
the charge and is not in excess of 5 times the

stoichiometric amount required for the work of
reduction, plus the amount required to generate

the heat of reduction,
c) hot air at a temperature from 500 to 1000°C is
blown onto the charge in the final zone from the

discharge end of the Waelz process kiln, the
amount of hot air being set such that there is a

hypostoichiometric ratio of oxygen to oxidisable
components in the gas atmosphere of the Waelz

process kiln,
d) in the charge in the final zone of the rotary kiln
a temperature from 1200 to 1500°C and an oxygen

partial pressure are set such that ZnO will
substantially be reduced by metallic iron

contained in the charge and the metallic iron will
substantially be reoxidised at the same time, 
e) a part of the zinc vapour contained in the gas
atmosphere is oxidised to ZnO in the Waelz process

kiln,
f) the temperature and composition of the exhaust gas
are set so that autothermic afterburning can be

effected,
g) the exhaust gas is completely afterburned outside
the Waelz process kiln by an addition of air,
h) the afterburned exhaust gas is cooled and
purified, and
i) the solids discharged from the Waelz process kiln
are cooled.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in
that a basicity of

is set in the mixture in (a).
A process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the cooling of the afterburned

exhaust gas in (h) is effected by an indirect heat
exchange with air and the heated cooling air is

supplied as hot air into the Waelz process kiln in (c).
A process according to Claim 1 to Claim 3,
characterised in that the afterburned exhaust gases are

cooled in (h) from a temperature above 400°C to a
temperature slightly above the acid dew point by

quenching with water.
