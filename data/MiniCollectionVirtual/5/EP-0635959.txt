<ABSTRACT>
1. Method of search, by a mobile unit, for a free time slice on a time-shared communications channel, for sending a standardised message including at least one indication of geographic position, the mobile unit participating with others located in the same geographical area in an anti-collision system in which the time is, in a conventional way, divided into reproducible time periods T, each period including a number N of time slices marked 1, 2, 3,...i,...N, in which system access to a time slice for sending the message from the mobile unit is done by marking free time slices in the course of at least one listening period T, then by random choice of a slice i from among the slices marked as free, the method being characterised in that:   a) for at least one period after the mobile unit has decided to take up slice i, the time of the slice i is distributed randomly into receiving subslices R and transmitting subslice E; b) as long as no transmission from another mobile unit has been received during the receiving subslices R, a transmission is commenced or continued during the following transmission subslices E of the slice i in progress, and the slice i is kept in the course of the following period; c) if a transmission is received from another mobile unit in the course of a reception subslice R no or no further transmission is made in the course of the following transmission periods E provided in the slice i in progress, and a new free slice j is chosen; d) the operations a and b above are done again on slice j, and if a transmission is received from another mobile unit operation C is done again.

Method by which a user can search for an unoccupied
time slot in a time-division communications channel, where

all the users are synchronised, the time being
conventionally divided into reproducible time periods T,

each period comprising a number N of time slots referenced
1, 2, 3,...i...N, the access to a time slot for the

transmission of the message from the user involving
identifying the unoccupied time slots during at least one

listening period T, followed by a random choice of one
slot i from among the slots identified as being

unoccupied, said method comprising the following features:

a) for at least one period after the user has
decided to occupy the slot i, the time of this slot i is

divided randomly into reception sub-slots R and
transmission sub-slots E;
b) so long as no transmission from another user has
been received during the reception sub-slots R, a

transmission is begun or continued during the following
transmission sub-slots E of the slot i in progress and the

slot i is kept during the following period;
c) if a transmission is received from another user
during a reception sub-slot R, no transmission is made, or

no more transmissions are made, during the following
transmission periods E planned in the slot i in progress

and a new unoccupied slot j is chosen;
d) the above operations a) and b) are performed
again on the slot j, and if a transmission is received

from another user, operation c) is performed again.
Method according to claim 1, wherein the reception or
transmission sub-slots conventionally constitute a set of

p sub-slots of equal durations, each sub-slot having a
rank referenced 1, 2,...p, the random character of the

distribution of the sub-slots into transmission and
reception sub-slots being ensured by the random choice of 

the rank of the sub-slots intended for reception or
transmission.
Method according to claim 2, wherein the number of
transmission sub-slots is at most equal to (p-1).
Method according to claim 1, wherein in a first phase
the random distribution of the transmission and reception

sub-slots leads to a total reception time that is greater
than the transmission time.
Method according to claim 3, wherein in a first phase
the random distribution of the sub-slots leads to a number

of reception sub-slots that is greater than the number of
transmission sub-slots.
Method according to claim 4, wherein in a second
phase the random distribution of the sub-slots leads to a

total transmission time that is greater than the total
reception time.
Method according to claim 5, wherein in a second
phase the random distribution of the sub-slots leads to a

number of transmission sub-slots that is greater than the
number of reception sub-slots.
Method according to either of claims 4 or 6, wherein
the user is a moving body and the transmitted message

includes at least one indication of geographical position,
the moving body participating with other moving bodies

located in one and the same geographical zone in an anti-collision
system, and wherein, during the first phase, the

random distribution of the transmission and reception sub-slots
leads to a first transmission sub-slot whose start

occurs at a certain time 1 after the start of the period,
the value of the time 1 being given by a random

generation whose average output value increases with the 
distance between the moving body and that one of the other

moving bodies which is closest to it.
Method according to either of claims 5 or 7, wherein
the user is a moving body and the transmitted message

includes at least one indication of geographical position,
the moving body participating with other moving bodies

located in one and the same geographical zone in an anti-collision
system, and wherein, during the first phase, the

random distribution of the transmission and reception sub-slots
leads to a first γ1 ranking transmission sub-slot,

the value of the rank γ1 being given by a random
generation whose average output value increases with the

distance between the moving body and that one of the other
moving bodies which is closest to it.
