<ABSTRACT>
An electrode for use in an electrolytic cell is disclosed, comprising a generally 
flat sheet (50) of flexible material having at least one electrically conductive 

surface. Upper and lower securing means are provided each comprising a tongue 
(55a,b) formed on one side edge (53) of the sheet (50) and a slot (56a,b) 

associated with an opposite side edge (54) of the sheet (50). The tongues and 
slots co-operate to enable the sheet (50) to be folded into and secured in an open 

frusto-conical configuration. This arrangement gives ease of removal from an 
electrolytic cell after use and advantages of requiring less storage and transport 

space in a flat configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrode for use in an electrolytic cell and in 
particular an electrolytic cell for the electrolytic recovery of silver from 
solutions containing silver, such as used photographic solutions such as fixing 
and bleach-fixing solutions. An electrode for use in an electrolytic cell is known from German patent 
specification DE 4007906-C1 (Kodak AG) for use in the electrolytic recovery of 
silver from solutions containing silver. The cathode is in the form of a 
generally flat sheet of flexible material having at least one electrically 
conductive surface, in particular a graphite foil carried on a backing of 
polymeric material. The sheet is generally rectangular and is provided with 
securing means, which enable the sheet to be folded into and secured in a open 
cylindrical configuration. A bolt passes through an aperture in the wall of the 
cell and through a hole in the cathode to clamp the cathode against a contact 
surface associated with the wall of the cell to complete an electrical connection 
from the cathode to a cathode connector outside the cell. The cathode used in electrolysis cells for the removal of silver is a replaceable 
item. In use, the cathode has silver deposited thereon in some quantity. It is 
necessary periodically to remove the cathode from the cell in order to recover the 
silver therefrom. By forming the cathode in cylindrical configuration the opening 
in the cell through which the cathode is to be removed has to be of significantly 
larger cross section, otherwise the is a risk that the used cathode will foul 
against the sides of the opening, dislodging particles of silver. These particles 
would eventually build up in the bottom of the cell, which would therefore require 
more frequent cleaning. However, if the opening through which the cathode is to 
be removed is significantly larger than the diameter of the cathode, it is not 
possible to reliably secure the cathode in the cell at the opening. Thin electrodes are easily damaged when transported in cylindrical form. It is 
advantageous therefore if thin electrodes can be transported in a flat 
configuration, in the form of a pile of such electrodes contained within a single 
package, such as a cardboard box. Furthermore, the replaceable nature of the cathode means that for optimally 
continuous use it is necessary for the user to keep a store of cathodes handy.  With cathodes which are in an open cylindrical or otherwise bulky configuration 
substantial storage space is required. It is an
