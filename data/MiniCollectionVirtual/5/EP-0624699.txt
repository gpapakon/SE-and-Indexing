<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling the flow rate of 
relatively low viscosity fluids, such as accelerators, in 

viscous, hydraulic slurry spray application systems. An 
adjustable accelerator flow control system which regulates excess 

air pressure supplied to the accelerator pump in response to 
height variations of the spray nozzle is provided. The system 

is especially useful with fireproofing compositions since it 
provides effective distribution and constant flow of a viscous, 

hydraulic cementitious slurry with an acidic accelerator.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known to spray apply hydraulic cementitious 
slurries onto metal structural members in order to provide a heat 
resistant coating thereon. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,719,513 and 
3,839,059 disclose gypsum-based formulations which contain, in 
addition to the gypsum binder, a lightweight inorganic aggregate 
such as vermiculite, a fibrous substance such as cellulose and 
an air entraining agent for such purpose. U.S. patent No. 
4,751,024 teaches sprayable cementitious compositions containing 
shredded polystyrene as a lightweight aggregate in fireproofing 
compositions. Such slurries are generally prepared at ground 
level and are pumped to the point of application, where they are 
spray applied to the substrate. Often the point of application 
exceeds 20 or 30 stories where high rise construction is 
involved, and the slurry is generally applied through a spray 
nozzle. Slurries must possess a number of important properties to 
be suitable as heat resistant coatings. First, they must be 
sufficiently fluid to be pumped easily and to great heights. 
Second, they must retain a consistency sufficient to prevent 
segregation or settling of ingredients and provide an adequate 
"yield" or volume of applied fireproofing per weight of dry mix. 
Third, they must adhere to the metal the structure member is 
comprised of, both in the slurried stated and after setting. 
Fourth, the slurry must set without undue expansion or shrinkage 
which could result in the formation of cracks that can deter from 
the insulative value of the coating.  U.S. Patent No. 4,934,592, the disclosure of which is 
incorporated herein by reference, teaches a slurry distributor 
for distributing a low viscosity fluid such as an accelerator 
into a viscous, hydraulic slurry. Specifically, the low 
viscosity fluid is introduced into the flowing high viscosity 
slurry, and means is provided in the distributor for directing 
the low viscosity fluid so that it may be substantially evenly 
dispersed (such as with air) with the slurry onto the steel 
member. In one embodiment, the means for directing the low 
viscosity fluid is an air stem appropriately positioned in the 
distributor to intersect the flow of the slurry. One difficulty encountered in spray applying multi-component 
blends such as cementitious slurries and set accelerators 
therefor is variable flow rates, in view of the back pressures 
which can develop in the system. If such back pressures are not 
carefully regulated, varying amounts of accelerator, for example, 
may be
