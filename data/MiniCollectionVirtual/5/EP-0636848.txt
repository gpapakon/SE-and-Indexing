<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for melting (smelting) an electrically conductive material (1) in a cold-crucible induction melting (smelting) furnace (10) in which a mass of the electrically conductive material (1) is electromagnetically confined, up to its melting point, the inclusionary particles contained in the liquid electrically conductive material (1) are separated off by creating at least one vortex in the said material by electromagnetic stirring, part of the mass of the liquid electrically conductive mass (1) is poured off into a pouring pipe (15) placed underneath the said melting furnace (10), the pouring stream of the liquid electrically conductive material (1) is subjected to radial electromagnetic confinement and there is provision for vertical coaxial alignment of the electromagnetic fields acting on the mass of liquid electrically conductive material (1) and on the pouring stream of the said mass. The subject of the invention is also a cold-crucible induction melting furnace for the implementation of this process.
