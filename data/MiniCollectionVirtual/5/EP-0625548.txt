<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition that
exhibits tack during the course of its cure and that
forms a cured product strongly adherent to a variety of
substrates when cured while in contact with a
substrate. The present invention also relates to a
method for the preparation of this composition.Many room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane compositions can be stored for long
periods of time in the absence of moisture and cure at
room temperature in the presence of moisture.
Moreover, when cured while in contact with a substrate,
they form a cured product that adheres to a variety of
substrates. As a result, they are used as adhesives,
sealants, and coatings in construction and industry,
and as coatings or potting compounds for electrical
devices and electronic instruments.Such room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane compositions are exemplified by:
(i) a room-temperature-curable organopolysiloxane
composition comprised of organopolysiloxane that
contains at least 2 silicon-bonded alkoxy groups in
each molecule, surface-treated silica, alkoxysilane or
partial hydrolysis condensate thereof, and titanium
chelate catalyst as shown by JP-A 61-247756
[247,756/1986];(ii) a room-temperature-curable organopolysiloxane
composition comprised of organopolysiloxane that
contains at least 2 trialkoxysilyl groups in each
molecule, surface-treated silica, alkoxysilane or
partial hydrolysis condensate thereof, and titanium
chelate catalyst as taught by JP-A 62-252456
[252,456/1987]; and (iii) a room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition comprised of
polydiorganosiloxane endblocked at both molecular chain
terminals with the alkoxysilylethyl group, surface-treated
reinforcing filler, alkoxysilane, and titanium
catalyst as disclosed by US-A 4,711,928.
The following are exemplary of attempts at
improving the adherence of room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane and the physical properties of the
cured product:(iv) a curable organopolysiloxane composition
comprised of the combination of a room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition comprising a
silanol-endblocked organopolysiloxane plus
organotriacetoxysilane and a free radical reaction-curing
organopolysiloxane composition comprising an
organopolysiloxane plus an organoperoxide as claimed in
US-A 4,034,140, and(v) a room-temperature-curable organopolysiloxane
composition comprised of silanol-endblocked
polydiorgano-siloxane, amidosilane, and organoperoxide
as described by US-A
