<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a chainless bicycle, in which the pedal drive engages directly on the rear wheel and the seat (1) is arranged approximately above the hub of the rear wheel. According to the invention, it is envisaged to design the front region of the frame in an articulated manner so that the position of the front wheel and of the fork can be changed in angle with respect to the rear frame, which is connected to the rear wheel and the seat. The centre of gravity of the bicycle is therefore varied to match the particular cycling situation. The diagonally extending centre stay (down tube) (2) comprises a front substay (20) and a rear substay (21), which are connected via a joint (11). A joint (120) is likewise arranged between the horizontal frame stay (crossbar) (12) and the handlebars (3).
