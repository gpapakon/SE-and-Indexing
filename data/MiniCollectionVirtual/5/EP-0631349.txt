<ABSTRACT>
A transient suppression contact assembly, capable of low working voltages 
and high energy handling capacity, including lightning suppression, employs a multi-layered 

varistor as the transient suppression device. The varistor is mounted in a 
notch in the contact and connected to ground via a ground sleeve. An insulator 

sleeve separates the ground sleeve from the contact, and both the insulator sleeve 
and ground sleeve include a gap or groove extending the length of the sleeve to 

permit the sleeves to be snapped onto the contact and aligned without the need for 
additional adhesive staking operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, and in particular to an 
electrical connector having transient suppression capabilities. As circuit densities of electronic devices increase, the sensitivity of the 
individual circuit elements in the devices to transient voltages also increases, 
making ever more critical the need for transient voltage suppression (TVS) of all 
signal and data inputs. This is often most conveniently accomplished by placing 
transient suppression filters within the miniature electrical connectors used to 
connect signal and data lines with the electrical devices. Examples of transient suppression elements which have been successfully 
placed in connectors include metal oxide varistors (MOV's) and zener diodes. Zener 
diodes are useful because they provide a low working voltage for the signal and  
 
data lines to the electrical devices, and because of their ability to limit 
voltage spikes of especially short duration and sharp waveform. 
However, zener diodes in sizes small enough to package inside a 
connector lack the power handling capacity of the otherwise less 
efficient metal oxide varistors. Therefore, zener diodes have 
conventionally been used to protect signal and data lines from relatively 
low energy electrostatic discharges, while metal oxide varistor devices 
have been required where protection from secondary lightening 
transients is necessary, such as in aircraft. Despite the utility of conventional transient suppression 
connectors, it has heretofore been impossible to achieve a transient 
suppression device for use in a connector which provides both the low 
working voltage and transient suppression capability of a zener diode, 
and the substantially increased energy handling capacity of a metal 
oxide varistor. Document US-A-4 746 310 describes an electrical connector 
provided with transient suppression capabilities. The transient 
suppression components include silicon diodes and monolitic planar 
capacitor. The Article of Electronic Engineering Vol. 62, no. 758 - 
February 1990, p. 47-51 describes several structures of multilayer 
varistors. Furthermore, the assembly of high density transient suppression 
contact assemblies for use in miniature connectors has heretofore been a 
relatively difficult procedure because of the small size of typical high 
density contact arrangements, and the numerous staking and alignment 
operations required to position and secure the various components 
without making the connector too large for the application. In

<CLAIMS>
A transient suppression contact assembly for use in an 
electrical connector comprising: 

   feed-through contact means (2) for carrying electrical signals 
from one electrical device to a second electrical device, said contact 

means including a transient suppression device mounting surface (16) 
and an insulator/ground sleeve mounting portion (10); 

   a transient suppression device (4) having two electrodes (6, 7) 
mounted on said device mounting surface such that one of said 

electrodes is electrically connected to said contact means and the second 
is electrically insulated therefrom; 

   a conductive ground sleeve (9) electrically connected to said 
second electrode and substantially surrounding said contact means; 

   means including an insulator sleeve (11) positioned between said 
ground sleeve and said mounting portion of said contact means for 

electrically isolating said ground sleeve from said contact means; and 
   means comprising grooves (21, 31) in said ground sleeve and 

insulating sleeve for permitting said contact means to be snapped into 
said ground and insulator sleeves in a radial direction of each of said 

sleeves. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, further characterized in 
that a width of said groove in said insulator sleeve is greater than or 

equal to the width of said groove in said ground sleeve. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, further characterized 
in that said groove in said insulator sleeve comprises means including 

bevelled edges (32) for permitting said contact means to be snapped 
into said insulator sleeve by causing said contact means to exert a 

tangential force on said insulator sleeve when said contact means is 
pushed into said insulator sleeve to cause said insulator sleeve groove to 

expand tangentially until said contact means has passed through said 
insulator sleeve groove, whereupon a restoring force of said insulator 

sleeve causes it to retract and lock said contact means within said 
insulator sleeve, said ground sleeve groove expanding and retracting 

together with said insulator sleeve groove. 
A method of assembling a transient suppression contact 
assembly characterized in that it comprises the steps of: 


(a) fitting a generally cylindrical conductive ground sleeve (20, 
114) having a longitudinally extending groove (21, 112) over a 

generally cylindrical insulator sleeve (11, 101) having a second 
longitudinally extending groove (31, 119) such that the grooves are 

mutually aligned; 
(b) pushing a feedthrough contact (2, 100) in a radial direction 
through the first longitudinal groove and subsequently through the 

second longitudinal groove; and 
(c) as the contact is being pushed through the second longitudinal 

groove, causing said insulator sleeve to expand such that edges of said 
groove move tangentially away from each other to permit the contact to 

pass through said groove, said edges moving back towards each other to 
their original positions after the contact has passed through the second 

longitudinal groove to lock the contact within the insulator sleeves. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, further characterized by the 
steps of mounting a transient suppression device (4, 104) on said 

contact and electrically connecting respective electrodes of said device 
to said contact and to said ground sleeve. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the step of mounting 
said device is characterized by the step of mounting said device in a 

recess (3, 109) of said contact. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, further characterized by the 
step of encapsulating said device within said recess. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said step of 
mounting said device is characterized by the step of mounting a multi-layered 

varistor on said contact.
