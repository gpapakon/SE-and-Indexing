<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a ceramic glow plug of 
current self-control type with a stable strength and a 

high-temperature strength resistant to thermal shocks. 
In this ceramic glow plug, the ceramic pipe (2) is 

secured to the hollow body (1) having the electrode 
(10) and is formed with the conductive printed layer 

(8) on its outer surface. One end of the pipe (2) is 
sealed by the ceramic filler (4) to form the hollow 

portion (9) inside the pipe In the hollow portion 
(9) sealed with N
2
 gas, the tungsten wire (3) is 
installed, with one end (7) connected to the 

conductive printed layer (8) and the other end (16) to 
the electrode (10). The outer circumferential surface 

(13) of the pipe (2) is formed with the ceramic outer 
surface coating layer (5). When the tungsten wire (3) 

and the conductive printed layer (8) are supplied with 
electricity, the conductive printed layer (8) 

functions as the heater portion (12) and the tungsten 
wire (3) as the current control portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic glow
plug used with diesel engines.A glow plug conventionally used in diesel engines
consists of a tungsten (W) wire embedded in a ceramics
such as silicon nitride. A tungsten (W) wire, for
example, has a resistance of 0.1 Ω at room temperature
and a current of 120 A for a 12 V power supply. When
the glow plug is heated with elapse of time from room
temperature to 900°C, the resistance of the tungsten
wire is 0.4 Ω and its current is 30 A. Then as the
glow plug is further heated, the resistance increases
until it stabilizes at 1 Ω, at which time the current
is 12 A. In other words, with the conventional glow
plug, when a current is supplied from a 12 V battery
by issuing a command from a controller, the current
value decreases from the initial value of 120 A with
an increasing resistance, which increases with the
temperature of a heater coil, until the current 
stabilizes when the resistance becomes 1 Ω. Thus, the
current is controlled by the controller so that the
resistance of the heater coil of the glow plug is
stabilized and held at 1 Ω.Another type of glow plug was developed which
self-controls its resistance at 1 Ω without the use of
a controller. Tungsten and nickel have
characteristics that the resistance increases with
temperature. Thus, tungsten wires and nickel wires
limit current flow as the temperature rises. The
self-control type glow plug consists of a tungsten
coil and a nickel coil connected in series, with the
tungsten coil embedded in a ceramics such as Si3N4.
That is, in the self-control type glow plug, a
conductor with a small resistance is arranged in a
heating body of the heater coil and is connected to
the nickel coil with a large resistance installed on
the upstream side of the conductor. When a current
flows, the nickel coil of the self-control type glow
plug is heated increasing the resistance, which in
turn reduces the current thus controlling the amount
of heat generated by the heating body of the heater
coil.The conventional self-control type glow plugs
include those disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
Nos. 34052/1992 and 19404/1985, and Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 157423/1984 and 106326/1983.The self-control type glow plug disclosed in the
Japanese Patent Publication No. 34052/1992, for
example, has a current control resistor connected in
series with a heating body to control the heating body
temperature when a current is being supplied and the
temperature is rising. In this glow plug, the heating
coil and the resistor
