<CLAIMS>
A method of making bread whereby a dough is prepared by
kneading and lumps of fermented dough are baked, the

said production, continuous and automatic, comprising
kneading by means of an atmospheric dough mixer-pump

means (13-40), characterised in that the dough mixer-pump
means comprises integrated self-cleaning means.
A method of making bread according to claim 1, characterised
in that shaping is carried out prior to

fermentation and directly after kneading at the exit
from the dough mixer-pump (13-40) without a resting

phase.
A method of making bread according to claim 1 or claim
2, characterised in that production of the dough is

carried out in a predetermined temperature range
advantageously of the order of 30 to 40°C.
A method of making bread according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the mixing of the flour, water and

yeast is carried out in a relatively short time and in
the vicinity of the mouths of the yeast sifted flour

silos (11, 12).
A method of making bread according to claim 4, characterised
in that the flour is caused to fall freely from

a predetermined height between its emergence from
the silo (12) and its entry into the dough mixer-pump

(13-14). 
A method of making bread according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that it is carried

out by causing a circulation of the lumps (
p
) shaped
after kneading in a fermentation chamber (100) where the

path is sufficiently long for the dough to "rise" satisfactorily
before the lu
mps are introduced into an oven
(110) contiguous upon the fermentation chamber from

which the products of conversion of flour into dough
emerge after baking.
A method of making bread according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that for the cleaning

phase the ratio of the flour/yeast/water mixture is
varied to make more fluid the dough produced

continuously and then, after a dwell time, washing is
carried out with clean water.
A machine for making bread for carrying out the method
according to any one of the preceding claims, said

machine comprising :

at least one salted flour silo (11) and at least one
yeast silo (120);
means (17, 20) for controlling the quantities of
salted flour and yeast delivered from these silos;
means (22, 23) for routing by gravity some flour and
yeast to an atmospheric dough mixer-pump (13, 40) to

which the necessary quantity of water is likewise
conveyed; said machine geing characterised by :
a deformable ducting (42) for continuously conveying
the kneaded dough to a cutting device (60, 70) for

forming lumps (
p
); 
self-cleaning means integrated into the dough mixer-pump
and also means of cleaning the said ducting (42)

for conveying the dough and of the device (60) for
cutting this latter;
receptacles (90) for lumps (
p
) rigid with chains (91,
91
a
) which cause them to circulate first in accordance
with a sinuous path in a fermentation chamber (100)

then in an oven (110), and
means (120) of controlling the return of the said
receptacles (90) and of guaranteeing their discharge

so that the cooked loaves which they carry are
extracted therefrom before the said receptacles,

continuing their movement, are again conveyed to a
lump depositing station (55).
A machine for making bread according to claim 8, characterised
in that the water carried to the dough mixer-pump

(13, 40) is at a predetermined temperature and is
heated by means of a coil (S) advantageously disposed in

the vicinity of the means (101) of heating the
fermentation chamber (100).
A machine for making bread according to claim 8, characterised
in that the receptacles of the lumps are swing

trays (90) the longitudinal ends of which are fixed to
two synchronous chains (91, 91
a
) with, at the outlet
from the machine, toothed and notched wheels (121, 122)

producing a reversal of the said swing trays in order
effectively to discharge the baked products which are

converted to bread.
A machine for making bread according to any one of
claims 8 to 10, characterised in that it comprises means 

(53) of regulating the temperature in the dough
producing zone in order to maintain the said temperature

within a predetermined range.
A machine for making bread according to claim 11,
characterised in that the said means maintain the

temperature of the dough producing zone at a level
comprised between substantially 30 and 40°C.
A machine for making bread according to any one of
claims 8 to 12, characterised in that a pressure sensor

(54) is associated with the dough mixer-pump (13, 40) to
regulate the quantity of dough delivered by the pump

(40) to the cutting device (55).
A machine for making bread according to any one of
claims 8 to 13, characterised in that it comprises means

of programming its automatic functioning in accordance
with a cycle chosen from a multiplicity of those offered

to the user such as the form and weight of the products
converted from flour to dough, their composition, the

operating hours, particularly the starting of the
machine, the counting of the products produced, the

cleaning cycles, etc.
A machine for making bread according to any one of
claims 8 to 14, characterised in that the self-cleaning

means integrated in the dough mixer-pump (13, 40)
comprise means of cleaning the kneader (13) by means of

a screw (36'), an end blade (37) on the said screw and
the kneading member (39) as well as peripheral pump

cleaning means (40). 
A machine for making bread according to any one of
claims 8 to 15, characterised in that the means of

cleaning the duct (42) for conveying dough and of the
means (60) of shaping the lumps comprise a mouth (141)

and a pump (142, 143) for evacuating cleaning water
circulating in the duct (61) traversing the movable

carriage (60) when this latter is in its cleaning
position.
