<DESCRIPTION>
 A POLYMORPHIC CELLULAR NETWORK ARCHITECTUREField of the InventionThe present invention relates to improvements in the field of wireless communication, more particularly, the use of nanoCell base stations to increase the capacity of wireless networks by employing and facilitating an improved multifaceted dynamically reconfigurable network topology.The invention further comprises a method of intercommunication among all nodes of a network to efficiently transport a variety of communications channels. Background of the InventionDue to limitations in the amount of bandwidth available, the cost, both economic and political, of building infrastructure and other reasons traditional cellular communications networks use a variety of geometric topologies to segment a coverage area into cells that facilitate efficient frequency reuse. Each cell typically contains a central antenna, and overlaps slightly with adjacent cells. Most common cellular coverage models use hexagonal or circular footprints, elongated directional coverage zones, sectored regions emanating from a central point, and combinations thereof. A patchwork of geometric coverage zones are pieced together to provide sufficient coverage for the subscriber base, and end-to-end communications is accomplished via a mobile network.These networks are hierarchical in nature in the sense that end-to-end 

communications paths are supported by a fan-out from various points of aggregation. The physical channels that carry the communications tend to be fixed, but configurable. Most mobile network topologies, such as GSMMAP or ANSI-41, include a Base Station Subsystem and a Network Subsystem. In the case of GSM, base transceiver station (BTS) hardware is deployed in connection with each antenna to communicate with a plurality of mobile stations (MS) in that cell at any given time. Base Station Controller (BSC) equipment is deployed in such a manner that one BSC will control and communicate with a plurality of BTSs. Likewise, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) will control and communicate with a number of BSC's. In this manner, the communications path from the fixed network to a plurality of mobile users is easily defined and controlled. A mobile packet data network is configured in a similar manner. Typically, the BSC interfaces to a packet data network support node that provides access to a public data network. In the case of GSM, the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) provides this connectivity between the Base Station Subsystem (BSS) and the Gateway GPRS Support
