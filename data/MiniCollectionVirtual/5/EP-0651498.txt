<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to current detection in
power conversion.Power supplies include current limiting circuits
for several reasons, among them, to protect internal
components of the power supply from excessive power
dissipation, to protect the source from overload, and to
prevent damaging currents from entering a user's wiring
and load.In addition, zero current switching (ZCS)
converters of the type described in U.S. Patent
4,415,959, must limit their
output current for proper operation since there is a
value of load current above which zero-crossing will not
occur. One such ZCS converter 10, shown in Figure 1, has
a leakage-inductance transformer 12 that transfers power
from a primary 11 to a secondary winding 13. The power
transfer occurs in a series of energy transfer cycles,
where the switching frequency of switch 16 varies the
amount of power delivered to the load 20.Various control schemes may be implemented to keep
Ichoke at or below a maximum value. For example, a
resistive shunt 30 may be placed in the serial path which
carries Ichoke, as shown in Figure 3. The voltage across
this resistor 30, Vshunt, indicates Ichoke, and may be
input to appropriate control circuitry to limit the value
of Ichoke. In other schemes, the output current may be
sensed magnetically (e.g., by means of a transformer with
a suitable core reset circuit; by means of a Hall-effect
device).EP-A-0 432 603 of ANT Nachrichtentechnik GmbH measures
a current by utilizing a current transformer to provide a
scaled replica of the combined current of two capacitors.
The scaled replica is passed through a resistor to develop
a voltage which is integrated by a diode, resistor,
capacitor combination to produce a voltage representative of 
the peak value of the combined currents of the two
capacitors.According to a first aspect of the invention, we
provide apparatus comprising power conversion circuitry
adapted operatively to deliver power from an input source
to a load via a first capacitor in a series of energy
transfer cycles, wherein said power
conversion circuitry is operatively adapted such that
during at least a portion of each of said energy transfer
cycles, substantially all of the current delivered to said
load is delivered by said first capacitor, and characterised in that said
power conversion circuitry further comprises measurement
circuitry adapted operatively to derive a measure of the
rate of change of voltage across said first capacitor

first capacitor or in a
