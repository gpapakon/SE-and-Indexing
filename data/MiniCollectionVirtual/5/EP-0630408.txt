<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the application of genetic engineering
techniques to create novel strains of A. niger which produce
high levels of an endogenous catalase enzyme (catR gene
product, catalase-R) while generating minimal sodium gluconate
waste material. Specifically, high levels of catalase-R are
generated through replacement of the endogenous catR gene
promoter with the A. niger glucoamylase (glaA) gene promoter
which results in not only higher levels of catalase-R, but also
eliminates the requirement for hydrogen peroxide to act as an
inducer for catalase synthesis, and deletion of the endogenous
glucose oxidase (goxA) gene greatly reduces the level of sodium
gluconate waste product, thereby minimizing the need for
expensive waste handling.Catalases [hydrogen peroxide: hydrogen peroxide
oxidoreductases (EC 1.11.1.6)] are enzymes which catalyze the
conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxygen (O2) and water
(H2O) according to the following formula:
These ubiquitous enzymes have been purified from a variety of
animal tissues, plants and microorganisms (Chance and Maehly
1955 Methods Enzymol. 2: 764-791; Jones and Wilson 1978 in H.
Sigel (ed.), Metal Ions in Biological Systems, Vol. 7, Marcel
Dekker Inc., New York). Nearly all forms of the enzyme which
have been characterized consist of four polypeptide subunits,
each having a molecular weight of 50,000 to 60,000 and
containing one protohemin prosthetic group per subunit
(Wasserman and Hultin 1981 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 212: 385-392;
Hartig and Ruis 1986 Eur. J. Biochem. 160: 487-490).
Bovine liver catalase has been the most extensively studied
variety of this enzyme [Schonbaum and Chance 1976 in TheEnzymes (P.D. Boyer, ed.) 3rd edn., vol. 13, pp. 363-408,
Academic Press, New York]. The complete amino acid sequence
and three dimensional structure of bovine liver catalase are
known (Schroeder, et al., 1982 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 214:
397-412; Murthy, et al., 1981 J. Mol. Biol. 152: 465-499).Although less well-studied from a biochemical and biophysical
standpoint, catalases from filamentous fungi have several
characteristics that distinguish them from their mammalian
counterparts. While similar in subunit number and heme
content, fungal catalases are substantially larger molecules
than those from other organisms, having subunit molecular
weights ranging from 80,000 to 97,000 (Vainshtein, et al., 1986
J. Mol. Biol. 188: 63-72; Jacob and Orme-Johnson 1979 Biochem.
18: 2967-2975; Jones, et al., 1987 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 913:
395-398). More
