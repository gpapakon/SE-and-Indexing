<CLAIMS>
Moulding composition which contains 

A) 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic polymers, 
B) 5 to 250 parts by weight of sized glass fibres 
and 
C) 0 to 30 parts by weight of conventional additives 
and auxiliary substances, 
 
characterised in that the glass fibres (B) have a size 

which contains, in addition to conventional sizing 
agents, an epoxy-functional, oligomeric resin which 


i) has a content of epoxy groups of 0.15 to 0.75 mol 
per 100 g of epoxy-functional, oligomeric resin 

and 
ii) has an average functionality of at least 2.3 
epoxy groups per molecule and 
iii) contains no emulsifiers not bound to the resin. 
Moulding composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the epoxy-functional, oligomeric 

resin contained in the glass fibre size is a polyester 
containing epoxy groups, which polyester may be 

obtained by condensation or addition of 6 to 40 wt.% 
of a polyalkylene oxide-modified polyester containing 

acid groups and having a content of ethylene oxide 
units such that the proportion of ethylene oxide units 

in the overall resin is at least 5%, and 60 to 94 wt.% 
of one or more compounds containing epoxy groups which  

 

a) have a content of epoxy groups of 0.16 to 
1.25 mol per 100 g of epoxy-functional, 

oligomeric resin and 
b) an average functionality of at least 2.3 epoxy 
groups per molecule. 
Moulding composition according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the epoxy-functional, oligomeric 

resin contained in the glass fibre size is a polyester 
containing epoxy groups, which polyester may be 

obtained by addition of 6 to 40 wt.% of a polyalkylene 
oxide-modified polyester containing acid groups and 

having a content of ethylene oxide units such that the 
proportion of ethylene oxide units in the overall 

resin is at least 5%, and 60 to 94 wt.% of one of more 
compounds of the general formula (I) containing epoxy 

groups 

 
wherein 


R
means hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 to 5 
carbon atoms and 
n
means a number from 0.3 to 4. 
Moulding composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the thermoplastic polymer 

comprises aromatic and/or aliphatic polyamides. 
Moulding composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the thermoplastic polymer 

comprises one or more poly(arylene sulphides). 
Moulding composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the thermoplastic polymer 

comprises one or more thermoplastic polyesters. 
Use of the moulding compositions according to one of 
claims 1 to 6 for the production of mouldings, 

compression moulded parts, injection moulded parts, 
thermoformed parts, semi-finished products, sheets, 

containers, equipment parts, casings, rollers, gears, 
machine parts and rolls.
