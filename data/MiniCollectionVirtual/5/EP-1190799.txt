<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for machining a hard metal or solid
carbide bar.It is known that the practice of manufacturing metal machining tools,
such as drill bits or milling cutters, by using a sintered material that offers
particular functional characteristics and is known as solid carbide, is
widespread.Currently, such tools are produced by successive cuttings of a bar of
adequate length and by transferring the resulting cut blanks, each meant to
form a tool, to a sharpening machine, which provides a perimetric bevel on
one of the end faces and a pointed tip at the other face if a drill bit is to be
obtained.The means currently offered by the prior art, however, produce cut blanks
whose two end faces are not perfectly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
of the blanks, with consequent problems in the balancing of the resulting
tools.The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a device for
machining a solid carbide bar which is capable of forming cut blanks whose
end faces are perfectly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cut
blanks and can also perform, on the cut blanks obtained by cutting the bar,
the above cited machining operations, which are currently entrusted to
sharpening machines.This aim is achieved by a device for machining a solid carbide bar,
according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises means suitable
to support the bar and turn said bar during machining, and a wheel for
cutting said bar, which is supported by means suitable to move said wheel
toward and away from the bar.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will 
become better apparent from the description of a preferred but not exclusive
embodiment of the invention, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device according to the invention;Figures 2, 3, 4 are views of the cutting wheel comprised within the device
in three different machining steps;Figures 5 to 10 are schematic views of some steps of the operation of the
device.With reference to the figures, the reference numerals 1 and 2 respectively
designate two heads which can slide on longitudinal guides 3, 4 and 5, 6
which are associated with the footing 7 and are provided with independent
motorization means which comprise, for the head 1, a screw 8 actuated by a
gearmotor 8a and, for the head 2, a screw 9 actuated by a gearmotor 9a, the
screws being coupled to respective female threads provided on the heads.The heads 1

opening and closing the mandrel supported by each head comprise an

actuation cylinder associated with said head.
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that the means for
producing the simultaneous rotation of the mandrels supported by the two

heads comprise a splined shaft which is actuated by a motor supported by
one of said heads, slidingly associated with a hub for each head which is

kinematically connected to the mandrel that is present on the corresponding

head.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the motorized
slider for supporting the cutting wheel is motorized by means of a screw-and-nut

kinematic pair.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that said means for
moving the cutting wheel are supported on board the slider that supports said

cutting wheel.
