<ABSTRACT>
An electrodeposition coating composition is described 
comprising: 


(a) an aqueous dispersion of a water-dispersible, electrically-depositable, 
at least partially neutralized cationic resin, 

and 
(b) polymer microparticles, said polymer particles being prepared 
by: 


(1) blending an acid-neutralized tertiary amino-functional 
acrylic polymer and a polyepoxide, 
(2) dispersing the blended mixture in an aqueous medium to 
form a dispersion of microparticles of the blended 

mixture, and 
(3) heating the dispersion to crosslink the acrylic and 
polyepoxide in the microparticles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeposition coating 
compositions, and in particular to such compositions including 
crosslinked microparticles. Electrodeposition coating, or electrocoating, is 
widely used in the art for the application of polymer coatings 
to metal substrates. Electrodeposition baths usually comprise 
a principal film-forming resin, such as an acrylic or epoxy 
resin, with ionic groups that can be salted so that the resin 
can be dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous bath. Pigments 
(dispersed in resin pastes), dyes, flow control agents, and 
other additives are often included in the electrocoat bath. For automotive or industrial applications where hard 
electrocoat films are desired, the bath also includes a blocked 
crosslinking agent that unblocks under appropriate conditions (e.g., 
with the application of heat) to react with functional groups on the 
principal resin and thus cure the coating. One of the advantages of electrodeposition coating 
compositions and processes is that the coating composition can be 
applied to a variety of metallic substrates regardless of shape or 
configuration. This is especially advantageous when the coating is 
applied as an anticorrosive coating onto a substrate having a number 
of irregular surfaces, such as a motor vehicle body. In order to 
maximize an electrodeposition coating's anticorrosion effectiveness, 
it is important that the coating form a contiguous layer over all 
portions of the metallic substrate. Two criteria for measuring the effectiveness of an 
electrodeposition coating for covering all portions of the substrate 
are throwpower and edge coverage. Throwpower measures the 
effectiveness of an electrodeposition coating at covering recessed 
or interior areas of a metal substrate. Edge coverage measures the 
effectiveness of an electrodeposition coating at covering the edges 
of a metallic substrate. Good throwpower and edge coverage are 
important in order to maximize an electrodeposition coating's 
anticorrosion effectiveness. Electrodeposition coatings must often satisfy a number of 
other criteria as well. A high degree of smoothness is often  
 
desirable. For example, when the electrodeposition coating serves 
as a primer for a high-gloss topcoat, the primer layer must be very 
smooth in order for the topcoat to have a satisfactory appearance. 
It is also advantageous to exhibit stability over a range of pH. It is therefore desirable to provide an electrodeposition 
coating composition that provides good throwpower and edge
