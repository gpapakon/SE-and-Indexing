<DESCRIPTION>
Transposable elements, such as transposons, 
insertion sequences, and transposing bacteriophages, are 
found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These 
elements are capable of insertion events at few or many 
different sites along the genome. This ability to 
transpose and insert, even in the absence of DNA 
homology, has allowed transposable elements to be 
exploited as powerful genetic tools. Some examples of 
the utility of such elements include gene mapping, use 
as promoter probes, construction of insertion mutations, 
the mediation of intergeneric recombination, the 
insertion of genetic information into the genome of a 
recipient strain, and the genetic tagging of specific 
genes. The development and exploitation of recombinant DNA 
technology in Streptomyces and related genera depends 
upon the availability of genetic tools for the 
introduction of foreign DNA or of multiple copies of 
native DNA into the genome of these cells. This 
development has been retarded by the very low number of 
transposable elements presently available for use in 
Streptomyces and related genera such as 
Streptoverticillium, Saccharopolyspora, Chainia and 
Mycobacteria. The transposable elements available for utilization 
in Streptomyces include: IS110 (Bruton, C. and K. 
Chater, 1987, Nucleic Acids Res., 15:7053-7065); 1S281 
 
(Sladkova, A. 1986 Mol. Biol., 20:878-881); Tn4556 
(Chung, S. 1987 J. Bacteriol., 169:4436-4441); the 2.6 
kilobase minicircle from Streptomyces coelicolor 
(Lydiate, D., et al., 1986, Mol. Gen. Genet., 203:79-88) 
and IS493 and transposons derived therefrom. Insertion sequence IS493 was isolated from 
Streptomyces lividans using a transposon trap. 
Solenberg, P. and S. Burgett, 1989, J. Bacteriol., 171: 
4807-4813. A variety of transposons have been developed 
utilizing IS493. See Solenberg, P. and S. Burgett,1989, 
J.Bacteriol., 171:4807-4813; McHenney, M. and R. Baltz, 
1991, J. Bacteriol., 173: 5578-5581; Hahn, D. et al, 
1991, J. Bacteriol., 173:5573-5577; and Solenberg, P. 
and R. Baltz 1991 J. Bacteriol., 173:1096-1104. The 
aforementioned transposons have proven to be useful in 
genetic manipulations of the various Actinomycetales. 
Transposons derived from IS493 exhibit transposition 
frequencies of about 10⁻⁶. Transposon Tn5099, a xylE promoter probe 
transposon, which was described in Hahn et al., supra, 
was modified to comprise a promoter driving constitutive 
production of xylE. Transposon Tn5099-7 is the 
designation for the Tn5099 derivative containing the 
constitutivel
