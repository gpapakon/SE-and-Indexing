<ABSTRACT>
A filter with a preselected attenuation/wavelength characteristic, in which spatially separated parts of the filter attenuate different wavelengths, said spatially-separated parts having different attenuation characteristics whereby to attenuate different wavelengths in a predetermined manner to provide a selected attenuation/wavelength characteristic. In one arrangement said interference type filter includes a grating, the pitch of which varies spatially. In one instance, the means to determine the proportion of the radiation subject to interference comprises a grating of spatially-varying effectiveness, but alternatively the means to change the proportion of radiation subject to interference may comprise an attenuation filter, the attenuation effect of the attenuation layer (23) varying spatially. In another arrangement, said filter may include means to separate received radiation into a spatially-disposed spectrum, and means (54) is provided to attenuate different parts of the spatially-disposed spectrum in such a manner as to provide said selected attenuation/wavelength characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FILTER WITH PRESELECTED ATTENUATION/WAVELENGTH CHARACTERISTICThe present invention relates to a filter with a selected attenuation/wavelength characteristic, and a method for making the same.It is known that the erbium (or other rare earth) doped fibre amplifiers or other types of fibre amplifiers are very attractive devices for optical communications and are likely to become widely used in place of optoelectronic repeaters. However, as it is generally desirable to multiplex signals by means of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), the gain spectrum of an erbium doped fibre amplifier (simplified in Figure 1) is not ideal having one large peak A and a (usually) lower peak B and a flatter spectrum over the desired range R, as shown in Figure 2, would be desirable, especially where a series of amplifiers are used, to avoid large differences in gain across the wavelength band. Thus if the different signals which are to be multiplexed are provided at wavelengths λ1f λ2....λ5 as shown in Figure 1, the signal at wavelength λ2 will be amplified considerably greater than the signals at wavelength λ1 and λ3 or λ5 and the signal at wavelength λ4 will be amplified to a slightly less extent than λ2- This clearly creates problems particularly if the WDM signal is 

passed through several erbium doped fibre amplifiers. One method of obtaining a flatter gain spectrum is to introduce a filter into the system with a selected attenuation/wavelength characteristic to compensate for the variation of the spectrum from a preferred flat spectrum.It will be understood, in addition to the peaks A and B the erbium spectrum includes fine detail (not shown). It is possible to eliminate peak A by means of a filter such as a known interference filter (eg: grating filter) with an attenuation characteristic shown in Figure 3 having a maximum attenuation at C at the interference wavelength and an attenuation peak D at lower wavelengths by matching peak D with peak A. Such an arrangement is described in an article entitled "D-Fibre Filter for Erbium Gain Spectrum Flattening" (Electronics Letters, 16 January 1992 Vol 28, No 2, page 131-132). Such a filter can improve the flatness of the gain spectrum to within 0.5dB over a 30nm span. Figure 4 shows the erbium gain spectrum after passing through the filter with the characteristic of Figure 3. Nevertheless, peak B of the amplifier gain spectrum remains, and indeed this feature can be accentuated when the signal is passed through a succession of erbium doped fibre amplifiers with such

CLAIMS
1. A filter with a selected attenuation/wavelength characteristic over a range of wavelengths in which the filter extends in a generally linear manner, the filter being adapted so that the wavelength of radiation which the filter attenuates varies continuously from a first part of the filter which attenuates a first wavelength to a second part, spaced from the first part, which attenuates a second wavelength, the first and second wavelengths defining the range of wavelengths, the filter being arranged so that the degree of attenuation varies in a selected manner from said first part to said second part to provide said attenuat on/wavelength characteristic.
2. A filter as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the filter is an interference filter, the dimensions of interference means of said interference filter which provides the interference and defines the wavelength varying in a continuous manner across the filter between said two parts, and attenuation means (22,54) is spaced in a continuous manner across said filter to determine the proportion of radiation subject to interference at each point across filter.
3. A filter as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that said interference filter includes a grating (22), the pitch 


of which varies spatially.
4. A filter as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that the means (22,54) to determine the proportion of the radiation subject to interference comprises a grating (22) of spatially varying effectiveness.
5. A filter as claimed in claim 3 or 4 characterised in that the pitch of said grating (22) is 0.4 to 0.7μm, the spatial variation from said first part to the second part being 5%.
6. A filter as claimed in claim 3 or 4 characterised in that the pitch of said grating (22) is substantially 0.53μm, the spatial variation from said first part to the second part being 5% .

A method for producing a filter comprising passing to a radiation transmitting material with defect states two beams of radiation which change the density of defect states, said radiation being provided in the form of two beams which provide an interference pattern on said material, one of the beams being divergent or convergent with respect to the other beam whereby to provide an interference grating pattern of density of defect states with spatially varying pitch, and further modifying the density pattern of defect states spatially across the interference pattern either as the interference pattern is produced or thereafter to provide a filter in accordance with claim 1.
11 A method as claimed in claim 10 in which the density pattern of defect states is modified as the interference pattern is provided by passing said beams to the material through a filtering medium of spatially varying attenuation property.

15. A filter as claimed in claim 14 characterised in that said filter is an interference filter, and in which said spatially separated parts of the filter comprise separate grating means, the pitch of said grating means being predefined, at least some of said grating means having pitches differing from one another.
