<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber ribbon stack in which individual ribbons (11, 12) are prestressed
according to a predetermined tension/compression distribution before being

laminated together in a stack (10). This distribution corresponds to expected thermomechanical
conditions which occur during the service of the cable housing the ribbon

stack, and may be linear or non-linear, symmetric or non-symmetric, producing
straight or curved stacks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a fiber optic cable having a pre-stressed
ribbon stack, and more particularly to a cable having stacked ribbons which are
pre-stressed according to a distribution that corresponds to expected thermo-mechanical
conditions to occur during the service of the cable.In fiber optic cables with stranded, twisted, or straight ribbon stacks, the
comer fibers experience a high level of attenuation, which reduces the cable's
performance characteristics and limits the level of recommended thermo-mechanical
loads. As shown in Fig. 4, the comer fibers 41a of the laminated ribbon stack 41 of
the fiber optic cable 40 are located the most remotely from the geometrical center of
the ribbon stack. Consequently, under mechanical bending and contact stresses from
surrounding cable components such as buffer tube 42, the comer fibers 41a usually
have maximum stress levels as compared with the centrally located fibers. Moreover,
under thermal loading, the thermoplastic material of the buffer tube 42 expands and
contracts in both longitudinal and radial directions. Corresponding displacement of
the thermally loaded buffer tube 42 places an additional stress on the comer fibers
41a. The attenuation in the comer fibers 41a of the ribbon stack 41 may be reduced
by increasing the gap between the comers of the ribbon stack 41 and the buffer tube
42 (i.e., by providing a larger buffer tube). But this approach leads to an undesirable
increase in the cable diameter.It is an object of the present invention to improve the optical performance of the 
cable through increased thermo-mechanical load resistance of a cable in which a
laminated ribbon stack is provided.It is a further object of the present invention to reduce the attenuation
experienced by the comer fibers of an optical fiber ribbon stack provided in a cable,
without increasing the diameter of the cable.These objects are fulfilled by constructing an optical fiber ribbon stack in
which some of the optical fiber ribbons are pre-stressed according to a predetermined
tension/compression distribution before being laminated together in a stack. This
distribution corresponds to expected thermo-mechanical conditions which occur
during the service of the cable housing the ribbon stack, and may be linear or non-linear,
symmetric or non-symmetric, including anti-symmetric.The above objects and advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent by describing in detail a preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the
attached
