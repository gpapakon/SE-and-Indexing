<ABSTRACT>
Method of making a distribution circuit for electrical signals in a piezoelectric or ultrasonic-wave motor. Electrodes (2) made of a conducting material are deposited on one face of a strip (1) of dielectric material. On the other face of the strip (1) conducting tracks (4) are deposited following a previously designed interconnection diagram for feeding the piezoelectric elements (3) in an appropriate way. Holes (5) are produced passing through the strip (1) between the conducting tracks (4) and the electrodes (2) and, by metallisation or deposition of conducting material, these holes (5) are made conducting.
