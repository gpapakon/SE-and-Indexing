<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker, in particular a line circuit breaker, whose latching mechanism (1) which operates at least one switching contact (7) can be unlatched by means of a thermal release (2) and possibly by means of a magnetic release (5), for which purpose the release acts on an unlatching device (3) by means of a tripping lever (4). It is provided   - that the thermal release (3) is arranged in a hold (8) which has a freely rotatable mounting with respect to the tripping lever (4) of the unlatching device (3), - the holder (8) being located with its rotation point (9) on an imaginary straight line (10) which passes through the contact point (11) of the thermal release (2) on the tripping lever (4) and the centre of the radius of the contour on the contact point (11), called the contour centre point (12).

Circuit breaker, in particular a line circuit 
breaker, the breaker mechanism (1) of which, operating 

on at least one switching contact (7), can be released 
by a thermal and perhaps a magnetic tripping device (2; 

5), for which purpose the tripping device operates on a 
release device (3) by means of a tripping lever (4),
 
characterized in that 


the thermal tripping device (2) is arranged in a 
support (8) which has a freely rotatable bearing with 

respect to the tripping lever (4) of the release device 
(3), 
whereby the support (8) lies with its pivot (9) on 
an assumed straight line (10), which extends through 

the point of contact (11) of the thermal tripping 
device (2) on the tripping lever (4) and the radius 

centre of the contour at the point of contact (11), 
called contour centre (12). 
Circuit breaker according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the contour centre (12) and the 

pivot (9) lie close together. 
Circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the support (8) of the thermal 

tripping device (2) also accommodates a magnetic 
tripping device (5). 
Circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a magnetic tripping device (5) 

forms the support (8) for the thermal tripping device 
(3). 
Circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the thermal tripping device (2) 

is designed as bimetal which engages at the point of 
contact (11) of the tripping lever (4) in the tripping 

state. 
Circuit breaker according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the pivot (9) of the support (8)  

 
is designed to be particularly low in tolerance and 

rigid.
