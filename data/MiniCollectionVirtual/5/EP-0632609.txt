<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is disclosed for diminishing the 
electromagnetic interference that results from TDMA and TDD radios, i.e., radios 

which radiate an RF signal with a time-varying envelope. A radio comprising an 
embodiment of the present invention radiates, in transmit mode, an information-bearing 

signal at an average RF power in an appropriate transmit frequency channel 
(determined by 119,115) but radiates, in idle mode, a spurious signal at the same 

average RF power (by virtue of loop 107,111,113,101) but in a frequency channel set 
aside for the spurious signal. In essence, the radio transmits during its idle mode at 

the same average power level as during transmit mode but in a different frequency 
channel (determined by 119,115), one that is dedicated to that purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio in general, and more particularly, 
to methods and apparatus which prevent RF baseband interference. Any RF signal with a time-varying envelope can induce baseband 
interference in a device characterized by a nonlinear response to radio waves. The 
mechanism could be, but is not necessarily, a second-order nonlinearity that 
produces an effect similar to that of a square-law envelope detector. When the 
square-law-detected envelope contains significant energy in the audio band, the 
result could be, for example, undesirable interference to wearers of hearing aids. The present invention provides a technique for diminishing the 
interference caused by an RF signal with a time-varying envelope while avoiding 
many of the costs and restrictions associated with other techniques. Specifically, 
embodiments of the present invention can be especially well-suited for radios in 
systems employing time division multiple access ("TDMA") (e.g., GSM, IS-54, 
JDC), time division duplexing ("TDD") (e.g., CT-2), and hybrid systems 
("TDMA/TDD") (e.g., PHP and DECT). For the purposes of this specification, 
TDMA, TDD and TDMA/TDD systems shall all be referred to as TDMA systems. These results are obtained in an illustrative embodiment of the present 
invention which comprises a TDMA radio having a transmit mode and an idle mode. 
During the transmit mode, the radio transmits an information-bearing signal in a first 
frequency channel with a first average RF power. During the idle mode, however, 
the radio transmits a signal in a second frequency channel with a second average RF 
power. FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention.  FIG. 2 depicts a block diagram of a second illustrative embodiment of 
the present invention. FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of the operation of an illustrative embodiment 
of the present invention. FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention as presented in the context of a time division multiple access 
("TDMA") communications system, a time division duplex ("TDD") system, or a 
hybrid TDMA/TDD system. In, for example, a typical TMDA system, several users 
time-share a frequency channel in a round-robin order so that all benefit (e.g., 
transmit) from the channel. Each user's radio has (1) a transmit mode, when an 
information-bearing signal is radiated in the shared frequency channel, and (2) an 
idle mode, when nothing is radiated in the shared frequency channel. When one
