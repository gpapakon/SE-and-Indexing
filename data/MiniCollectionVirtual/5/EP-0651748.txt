<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing tryptamine derivatives and related compounds having a 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl moiety within the molecule comprises reacting 4-amino-1,2,4-triazol with a nitrobenzene derivative containing a readily displaceable group; deaminating the aminotriazolium salt thereby obtained by treatment with nitrous acid followed by neutralisation; reducing the triazolyl-nitrobenzene derivative thereby obtained by transfer hydrogenation; treating the triazolyl-aniline derivative thereby obtained with nitrous acid and then with an alkali metal sulphate, followed by acidification; and subsequently reacting the triazolyl-hydrazine derivative thereby obtained (in situ) with a suitable carbonyl compound, to obtain the required triazolyl-indole derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
preparation of a class of therapeutically active 
compounds. More particularly, the invention concerns an 
improved process for producing tryptamine derivatives and 
related compounds wherein the molecule also contains a 
1,2,4-triazol-1-yl moiety. EP-A-0497512, published on 5th August 1992, 
describes interalia a family of 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl 
derivatives to which is attached a substituent 
incorporating a tryptamine or similar moiety. These 
compounds are stated to be selective agonists of so-called 
"5-HT1-like" receptors and hence to be of 
particular use in the treatment of migraine and 
associated conditions such as cluster headache, chronic 
paroxysmal hemicrania, headache associated with vascular 
disorders, tension headache and paediatric migraine. We have now found an efficient and cost-effective 
method for preparing the aforementioned family 
of compounds. The present invention accordingly provides a 
process for the preparation of a compound of formula I: 
  
 
wherein E represents a bond or a straight or branched 
alkylene chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and R 
represents -CH2.CHR1.NR2R3 or a group of formula 
 
in which the broken line represents an optional chemical 
bond; and R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently represent 
hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; which process comprises the 
following steps: 
(i) reaction of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole of 
formula II with a compound of formula III: 
 
wherein E is as defined above, and D1 represents a 
halogen atom; to obtain a compound of formula IV: 
  
 
where E and D1 are as defined above; (ii) deamination of the aminotriazolium salt of 
formula IV thereby obtained by treatment with nitrous 
acid followed by neutralisation, to obtain a compound of 
formula V: 
 
wherein E is as defined above; (iii) reduction of the nitro compound of 
formula V thereby obtained by transfer hydrogenation 
using a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of a 
hydrogen donor, to obtain a compound of formula VI: 
 
wherein E is as defined above; and (iv) treatment of the aniline derivative of 
formula VI thereby obtained with nitrous acid and then 
with an alkali metal sulphite, followed by acidification, 
to obtain a hydrazine derivative of formula VII:  
 
 
wherein E is as defined above; which compound is 
subsequently reacted in situ with a compound of formula 
VIII or a dimethyl acetal derivative thereof: 
 
wherein Ra corresponds to the group R as defined above or 
represents a protected derivative thereof, or Ra 
represents a
