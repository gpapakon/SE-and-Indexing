<ABSTRACT>
Nonwoven sheet materials, and pressure sensitive adhesive tapes formed from nonwoven sheet materials are provided. The nonwoven sheet materials comprise a randomly interlaced fibrous web of tensilized nonfracturable staple fibers and binder fibers, wherein the fibrous web is pattern embossed, and is interbonded by a chemical bonding agent, physical entanglement, or a combination thereof, and further wherein the nonwoven sheet material is readily finger-tearable in the cross machine direction. Methods of making nonwoven sheet materials and adhesive tapes are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nonwoven sheet materials, 
and tapes made therefrom, and in particular, to improved nonwoven 
sheet materials and tapes that exhibit enhanced tear 
characteristics, wet and dry strength, and good Hand values. Nonwoven sheet materials are often used as the backing or 
web component of tapes and the like. These tapes are commonly 
used in the health-care industry for affixation of a variety of 
articles, such as dressings and tubings, and as backings and 
affixation materials for pre-made dressings, such as first-aid 
dressings and island-type dressings. They are also commonly used 
as affixation materials on certain types of products, such as 
diagnostic electrodes, surgical grounding plates, and monitoring 
electrodes. Tapes formed from nonwoven sheet materials fall into two 
general categories based on performance needs. Category I 
includes sheet materials, and tapes made therefrom, that can be 
torn in the cross machine direction. However, these materials 
often cannot be torn cleanly, and therefore, display uneven or 
irregular torn edges. On the other hand, category II includes 
those sheet materials and tapes that, for practical purposes, 
cannot be torn in either the machine direction or the cross 
machine direction. In general, category I nonwoven materials are predominantly 
comprised of cellulosic fibers, and exhibit a machine direction 
to cross machine direction tensile strength ratio of less than 
2.5 to 1. Cellulosic fibers are inherently fracturable (i.e., 
are easily broken under stress), as opposed to many synthetic, 
polymeric fibers, that are essentially nonfracturable. The cellulosic fibers used in category I sheet materials 
are typically bonded together by a chemical binder that 
immobilizes, or partially immobilizes the fibers. In addition, 
the chemical binder increases the density of the sheet materials, 
and provides other advantageous properties, such as enhanced 
tensile strength, elongation at break, Hand (i.e., 
conformability), fuzzing, and the specific tear characteristics 
noted above. However, these advantageous properties are rapidly 
compromised when the sheet material becomes wet, and especially 
when it becomes saturated with water or other water-based fluids.  
 Category II materials are most frequently formed from 
essentially nonfracturable synthetic fibers, and are either 
thermally, mechanically, or chemically bonded to provide 
structural integrity to the sheet materials. These materials can 
display enhanced tensile strength,
