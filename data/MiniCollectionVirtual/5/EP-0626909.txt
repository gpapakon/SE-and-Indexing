<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a transfer device comprising an optically variable transferable layer (3) on a carrier (1). A continuous adhesive layer (6) is coated on the transferable layer (3) and is selectively treated, for example by printing, to provide areas which are not bondable to a substrate under normal transfer conditions. When the treated adhesive layer (6) is contacted with a substrate (8) under normal transfer conditions, only non-treated areas of the adhesive adhere to the substrate so that only areas of the transferable layer (3) corresponding to the non-treated adhesive areas are transferred to the substrate (8) on separation of the carrier (1) and substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
transfer device, for example including an optically 
variable pattern. Optically variable pattern devices such as holographic 
labels have become well established within the security 
market, noticeably for the authentication of credit cards. 
Holograms are valuable anti-copy features especially 
against colour copying, photographic colour separation and 
electronic scanning colour separation methods. The conventional hologram transfer process is the hot 
stamping method but this is somewhat slow and requires 
special equipment. Thus the initial use of holographic 
labels has been confined to the higher price items, such as 
credit cards. The industry has been moving towards lower 
cost methods of hologram transfer and these have also 
allowed the use of holographic security devices in newer 
applications such as tamper evident labels. In these the 
holographic assembly may peel apart on tampering, 
destroying irreversibly the holographic effect. This is 
useful for product labelling. Holograms provide a useful authenticity check for a 
valuable or authenticatable item as well as having 
decorative value. It is desirable to be able to provide a 
new, less costly means of transfer which would enable them 
to be used more widely on mass produced items and to be 
applied in a patterned manner. Conventional hot stamping holographic transfer films 
incorporate a wax release layer between the carrier and the 
transferable layers. More recently WO 91/08524 has 
described a newer type of holographic transfer film in 
which the releasable thermoplastic layer is holographically 
embossed and metallised. Such an holographic transfer film 
is an extension of the transfer metallising films 
previously disclosed in the prior art in US-A-3235395, US-A-3589962, 
EP-A-38878 and EP-A-34392.  
 In WO-A-91/12694 = AU 53958/90 there is described a 
method of producing an image within a laminate by printing 
on a high temperature glue layer an image using carbon 
(such as toner) and then applying the whole material to a 
surface. The image is internal to the completed document 
and not accessible to tampering. Other transfer methods 
are described in EP-A-395411 and EP-A-145481. In existing holographic transfer processes the 
holographic layers are commonly transferred in their 
entirety i.e. as large areas or rectangular shapes in which 
no interruption of the holographic film is desired. It is 
desirable to be able to transfer holographic films in a 
patterned manner
