<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for a base station comprising a plurality of antenna 
arrays (40; Fig. 6a) each capable of forming a multiplicity of 

separate overlapping narrow beams in azimuth, the arrays being 
positioned such that the beams formed by the arrays provide a 

coverage in azimuth wider than each array. Means are provided 
for selecting (72, 80, 82; Fig. 6b) for a given call more than one of 

the best received signals from the multiplicity of narrow overlapping 
beams and for combining the selected signals to form a single 

receive signal input for an r.f. transceiver for the given call.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station antenna arrangement, for use
in a Cellular Radio communications system.Cellular radio systems are currently increasing in use throughout the
world providing telecommunications to mobile users. In order to meet
the capacity demand, within the available frequency band allocation,
cellular radio systems divide a geographic area to be covered into
cells. At the centre of each cell is a base station, through which the
mobile stations communicate. The available communication channels
are divided between the cells such that the same group of channels
are reused by certain cells. The distance between the reused cells is
planned such that the co-channel interference is maintained at a
tolerable level.When a new cellular radio system is initially deployed, operators are
often interested in maximising the uplink (mobile station to base
station) and downlink (base station to mobile station) range. The
ranges in many systems are uplink limited due to the relatively low
transmitted power levels of hand portable mobile stations. Any
increase in range means that less cells are required to cover a given
geographic area, hence reducing the number of base stations and
associated infrastructure costs.When a cellular radio system is mature the capacity demand can
often increase, especially in cities, to a point where more, smaller
size cells are needed in order to meet the required capacity per unit
area. The process used to create these smaller cells is known as 
cell splitting. Any technique that can provide additional capacity
without the need for without the need for cell-splitting will again
reduce the number of base station sites and associated
infrastructure costs.The antenna used at the base station site can potentially make
significant improvements to the range and capacity of a cellular
radio system. The ideal base station antenna pattern is a beam of
narrow angular width as shown in Fig 1a. The narrow beam is
directed at the wanted mobile, is narrow in both the azimuth and
elevation planes, and tracks the mobile's movements. When
compared to an omni-directional antenna, such a beam will have
the dual benefits of having high gain, leading to increased range in
thermal noise limited initial deployments, and rejecting interference
from co-channel reuse cells allowing higher capacity without cell
splitting in mature deployments. The narrow beam reduces
interference in a balanced manner on the uplink and downlink. On
the uplink the base station receiver is protected from
