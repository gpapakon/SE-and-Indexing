<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an 
apparatus for controlling the drive of a parts feeder to 
feed a number of parts in succession along a part feed track 
in a parts feed unit by exerting vibration to the parts feed 
unit using electromagnetic vibration or piezoelectric vibration. 
More particularly, the invention is concerned with 
control method and apparatus for a self-excited vibration 
parts feeder, which is able to drive a parts feed unit in a 
controlled manner at a resonance frequency without the 
necessity of providing a particular detecting device mounted 
on the parts feed unit. A typical example of parts feeder of the type using 
electromagnetic vibration includes a bowl having a spiral 
parts feed track. Briefly stated, the spiral parts feed 
track is provided on the inside surface of a side wall of 
the bowl, and the bowl is provided with an attractable 
member attached to the underside of a bottom wall of the 
bowl. The attractable member is supported on upper ends of 
a plurality of spring members, the lower ends of the spring  
 
members being secured to a base, with a predetermined angle 
formed between each of the spring members and the base. The 
base supports on its upper surface an electromagnet which 
operates to intermittently pull or attract the attractable 
member, thereby exerting vibration to the bowl. The base is 
fixedly mounted on a floor surface via a suitable support 
member having a cushioning or damping action, such as rubber. On the other hand, a typical example of parts 
feeder of the type using piezoelectric vibration includes a 
bowl having the same construction as the bowl described 
above, and a plurality of pairs of spring members and piezoelectric 
elements directly connected together. The pairs of 
spring members and piezoelectric elements are attached at 
their upper end lower ends to the bowl and a base, respectively, 
with an angle formed between each pair of spring 
member and piezoelectric element and the base. The above-mentioned parts feeders are driven when 
the electromagnet or the piezoelectric elements are caused 
to vibrate by an electric power having a constant frequency 
(driving frequency). To improve the driving efficiency, a 
mechanical system is so designed as to have a natural frequency 
which is resonant with the driving frequency. However, 
in the parts feeder the natural frequency and amplitude 
of vibration of the mechanical system are greatly influenced  
 
by various factors, such as the bowl, resilient legs, base 
and
