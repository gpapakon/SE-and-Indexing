<ABSTRACT>
A silicon nitride layer in a semiconductor device is oxidized 
by exposure to a mixture of an oxygen reactant and a dilute 

amount of a fluorine-containing compound at a temperature 
sufficiently high to substantially cause the oxidation of the 

silicon nitride. Generally, a temperature greater than about 
600°C is sufficient to cause such oxidation, although some 

oxidation may occur at lower temperatures. The concentration 
of the fluorine-containing compound is also not critical, but 

is generally between about 100 to 1500 ppm by volume relative 
to the total mixture volume. Preferably, NF₃ is the fluorine-containing 

compound, and a temperature greater than about 
700°C at a concentration of between about 100 to 1000 ppm is 

used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor
devices and, in particular, to a method for oxidizing silicon
nitride in semiconductor devices using an oxidizing ambient
with a dilute amount of a fluorine-containing compound.Silicon nitride is commonly used in the manufacture of
semiconductor devices. One such use for silicon nitride is as
an insulation stack commonly known as an ONO layer (i.e. a
silicon oxide-silicon nitride-silicon oxide layer) which may
be used, for example, as a gate insulator or as an insulator
for a deep-trench memory storage device. One disadvantage of
the use of silicon nitride is that negative charge trapping
can occur at a nitride-oxide interface in an ONO layer, either
during processing of the device or during operation of the
device after manufacture (e.g. due to hot electrons). In some
cases, this charge trapping can sufficiently affect threshold
voltages within the device that parasitic leakage paths are
formed. These leakage paths may lead to sub-threshold leakage
within the device sufficient to cause its malfunction. Such
problems can be avoided if the trapped charges in the silicon
nitride can be released. Prior approaches have attempted to
accomplish this by heating the silicon nitride to relatively
high temperatures near the end of processing of the device or
by removing the silicon nitride which is holding the trapped
charges (e.g. silicon nitride may be removed by etching in hot
phosphoric acid). However, heating near the end of processing
can adversely affect metallization within the device, and
removal of the silicon nitride is often not practical due to a
need to maintain the structural integrity of a particular
device. Thus, in general, it would be preferable that the 
trapped charges be removed by a relatively low-temperature
processing step that does not require removal of the silicon
nitride.During processing, semiconductor devices are frequently
exposed to oxidizing ambients for the oxidation of, for
example, silicon. Although a silicon nitride layer within a
device is often conveniently exposed to these oxidizing
ambients, the prior teaching has been that silicon nitride
cannot be removed by oxidation because silicon nitride does
not oxidize. However, if the silicon nitride could be
converted to silicon oxide by oxidation, then there would no
longer be the problem of silicon nitride trapping injected
electrons. In many cases, oxidizing silicon nitride to form
silicon oxide could more readily be integrated into the
fabrication sequence for a
