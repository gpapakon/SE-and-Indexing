<ABSTRACT>
An airship for the transport of goods and passengers has a lattice body made of nodes (12) and circular and longitudinal beams (13, 15) stuck in or on receptions of the nodes, as well as tensioning ropes (14) which brace the circular and longitudinal beams in or on the receptions, are held on the nodes and form with the lattice body a three-dimensional framework. The lattice body consists of circular and longitudinal beams precisely cut to length with small tolerance and the nodes are braced by tensioning ropes provided with hooks (30) and cut with tight tolerance to the length needed to achieve the required pretensioning, so that a structure made of uniform components suitable for lattice bodies of various sizes is obtained. The lattice body can have a cargo bay (7) in its lower area, buoyant gas cells suspended on rings within the lattice body, a rope bracing of the gas cell enveloppe that substantially extends in the radial and axial directions in at least one gas cell and a winch drive that engages the rope bracing in order to adjust the gas cell volume. At least one inherently stiff, movable and lowerable cargo pallet secured to the lattice body which closes the cargo bay and forms its bottom, can be arranged in the lower area of the lattice body and allows the airship to be quickly loaded and unloaded, in particular with containers.

An airship for transporting goods and passengers, with a geodetic hull consisting of nodular
elements (12) and of circular and longitudinal struts (13, 15) which are connected to reception

cavities (21) in the nodular elements (12), and with tension ropes (14) engaging on the
nodular elements and bracing the circular and longitudinal struts (13, 15) on the nodular

elements (12) and forming, together with the geodetic hull, a three-dimensional grid structure,
characterized in that the circular and longitudinal struts (13, 15) are designed as closed

triangular hollow sections (13, 15) and fit in- or onto matching reception cavities (21) running
in the longitudinal and peripheral alignments of the geodetic hull, in that a base (27) of each

of the triangular hollow sections (13, 15) faces the exterior of the geodetic hull and in that the
corners of the outwardly-facing base (27) of the longitudinal struts (15) are equipped with

linear slots (26), broadening towards their interior and fining flush with matching linear slots
(26) on the outsides (27) of the nodular elements (12), and in that panels (19), equipped with

swellings (20) at their edges and forming the airship body skin, are inserted into the linear
slots.
An airship as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the nodular elements (12) are formed
in one piece with reception cavities (21) and ribs (22, 24), the reception cavities (21) for the

triangular hollow sections (13, 15) being arranged in a plane at an angle of 90Â° to one
another, the ribs (22) projecting across the inwardly-directed corners having suspension eyes

(23) for the tension ropes (14) and the ribs (24), lying roughly in the plane of the skin and
connecting the corner areas of the outward-facing base (27) of the reception cavities (21) for

the triangular hollow sections (13,15), having suspension eyes (25) for the tension ropes (14).
An airship as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the nodular elements (12) together
with the circular struts (13) and the tension ropes (14) form braced multi-cornered framework

rings (2), the bracing in the plane of each framework ring being directed from nodule to
nodule in such a way that a network of crossed tension ropes (14) spanning roughly the outer

third of the area of the ring is produced. 
An airship as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 to 3, characterized by a payload space (7)
designed as a self-contained frame structure arranged in the lower area of the geodetic hull.
An airship as claimed in Claim 4, characterized by at least one intrinsically rigid, vehicle-bearing
payload pallet (60) lowerably connected to the geodetic hull, forming the floor of the

payload space (7) and closing it off.
An airship as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the floor of the payload space (7) is
formed from several pallets (60), which may be lowered independently of one another and

whose width corresponds to that of the payload space (7) and whose length corresponds to
the distance between two adjacent rings (2) of the geodetic hull.
An airship as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that the first and/or last payload pallet (60)
in the longitudinal alignment of the airship are designed as entry and exit ramps.
An airship as claimed in one of Claims 5 to 7, characterized by anchoring elements each
running between one payload pallet (60) and the airship (1) landing area.
An airship as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the panels (19) forming
the airship body skin are made of plastic with reinforcing fibres embedded at least in the

swellings (20) at their edges.
An airship as claimed in one of Claims 3 to 9, characterized by buoyant gas compartments
(29) suspended within the geodetic hull on the framework rings (2) by means of tension ropes

(49), regularly distributed on the periphery of the buoyant gas compartment skin and aligned
essentially radially to its transverse central plane (50), and characterized by a bracing rope

complex (56, 57, 59) for the buoyant gas compartment skin, aligned essentially radially and
axially within at least one buoyant gas compartment (13), and characterized by a winch drive

(58) engaging on the bracing rope complex (56, 57, 59) for adjusting the volume of the 
buoyant gas compartment.
An airship as claimed in Claim 10, characterized in that the tension ropes (49) suspended on
the rings (2) in a longitudinal plane (51) on adjacent framework rings (2) are each connected

to one another in pairs within the buoyant gas compartments (29) by means of a rope (52)
and that these ropes (52) are stretched radially within the buoyant gas compartments (29).
An airship as claimed in Claim 11, characterized in that the ropes (52) are braced by means
of an annular tension rope arranged in the transverse central plane (50) of the buoyant gas

compartment (29).
An airship as claimed in Claim 12, characterized in that rollers (55) are arranged on a bracing
ring (54), or the annular tension rope, over which the ropes (56, 57, 59) of the bracing rope

complex are guided to the winch drive (58) for adjustment of the gas compartment volume.
