<DESCRIPTION>
Silica is one of the major fouling problems in many processes using 
water and it can assume many low solubility chemical forms depending on the 
conditions. Below about pH 7 for example, monomeric silica tends to 
polymerize to form oligomeric or colloidal silica. At higher pHs particularly 
above about pH 9.5, silica can form monomeric silicate ion. Since conversion 
can be slow, all of these forms may exist at any one time depending on the 
history of the system. Furthermore, the silicate ion can react with polyvalent 
cations like magnesium and calcium commonly present in process waters to 
produce salts with very limited solubility. Thus it is common for a mixture of 
many forms to be present: monomeric, oligomeric and colloidal silica; 
magnesium silicate, calcium silicate and other silicate salts. In describing this 
complex system, it is common practice to refer to the mixture merely as silica or 
as silica and silicate. Herein these terms are used interchangeably. In order to prevent the problems associated with the formation of silica 
scale, industrial engineers generally employ one of three general approaches: 
limit the amount of silica present in the system, use scale prevention agents, or 
a combination thereof. Limiting the level of silica introduced or allowed to 
accumulate in the aqueous system is still the primary method of dealing with 
the problem. When utilizing any of these three approaches, it is desirable to accurately 
know the level of silica present in the system. When relying on limiting the 
level of silica present in the system, if the system is flushed or replenished with 
make-up water when the silica levels are still low, energy and time are wasted. 
If the system is flushed or replenished with make-up water after the silica levels 
have risen too high, scale may already have formed. Similarly, it is desirable to 
know the level of silica so that scale prevention agents can be used 
economically. It would de desirable to be able to accurately measure the level of silica in 
an aqueous systems such as, for example: cooling water, boiler water, 
geothermal processing (used to generate electricity or for heating), and sugar 
(particularly cane and beet) processing. In each of these processes, heat is 
transferred to or from the water. In three of these systems, cooling water, boiler 
water and sugar processing, heat is added to the water and evaporation of some 
of the water takes place. As the water is evaporated the silica (or silicates) will  
 
concentrate. If the

A method for the quantitative determination of total soluble silica, consisting of 
water soluble silica, water soluble silicate and colloidal silica, present in solution 

in an aqueous sample containing one or more thereof, by colorimetric analysis, 
spectrophotometric analysis, inverse phase chromatography, atomic absorption 

analysis, direct current plasma analysis or inductively coupled plasma amalysis, 
comprising the preliminary steps of: 


i) diluting the sample to bring the anticipated soluble silica content 
of the original sample down to a level detectable by the particular measurement 

technique to be used; 
ii) adding to the sample, diluted as in step i), a chelating agent 
capable of binding metal atoms in the said sample; 
iii) if necessary, adding to the sample containing the said chelating agent a water-soluble 
inorganic or inorganic base in an amount sufficient to raise the pH of the 

sample to a value in excess of 10: and 
iv) heating and/or agitating the pH adjusted, chelating agent-containing sample 
thereby to solublize any colloidal silica present in the said sample prior to the said 

silica determination. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the chelating agent is ethylenediamine 
tetraacetic acid, nitriloacetic acid N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine triacetic acid, 

aminotris(methylenephosphonic acid), 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic 
acid, 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, diethylenetriamine 

pentamethylene phosphonate, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, 
triethanolamine, ethylenediamine tetra(methylenephosphonic) acid, or 

hexamethylenediamine tetra(methylenephosphonic) acid, or a partial or complete 
alkali metal or ammonium salt thereof. 
A method according to claim 1. wherein the chelating agent is ethylenediamine 
tetraacetic acid, nitriloacetic acid or N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine tetraacetic 

acid, or a sodium salt thereof. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the chelating 
agent is added to the sample, or the diluted sample, as the case may be, in an 

amount of from 10 to 50,000 ppm, preferably from 100 to 5000 ppm.  
 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein, in step iv), the 
sample containing the chelating agent is heated, preferably with agitation, to a 

temperature in the range of from 30째 to 100째C, preferably from 40째 to 70째C, for 
a period of from 30 minutes to 36 hours, preferably from 45 minutes to 24 hours, 

prior to the determination of the silica content. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein in step iii), the 
pH of the sample containing the chelating agent is adjusted to a value in excess of 

10 by the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein, following the

spectrophotometric analysis.
