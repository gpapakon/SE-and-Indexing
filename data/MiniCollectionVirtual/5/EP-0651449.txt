<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
component, particularly to a piezoelectric device having
a terminal electrode between a functional substrate and
a holding substrate, and a method for producing the same.Various kinds of piezoelectric devices utilizing
piezoelectric effects, such as quartz oscillators and SAW
filters, have widely been used as various high-frequency
filters and oscillators in radio communication equipment.
These piezoelectric devices use mechanical vibration of
a piezoelectric element which is generated when an
electric field is applied. Thus, the performance of such
piezoelectric devices greatly depends upon a method for
securing the piezoelectric element without affecting the
mechanical vibration. In particular, the development of
methods for securing a piezoelectric element without
adversely affecting piezoelectric characteristics,
hermetically sealing the piezoelectric element in the
piezoelectric device, and providing electrodes leading
out of the piezoelectric element have been important
subject.The following methods have been known for conventional
piezoelectric devices.One method is to mechanically secure a piezoelectric
element with springs, screws, etc. This method
is easy to perform but it is difficult to obtain a piezoelectric
device stable against thermal change, mechanical 
shock, etc. for a long period of time. Another method is
to secure a piezoelectric element with various adhesives
and conductive pastes made of an epoxy resin, a silicone
resin, etc. This method also has problems. That is,
since these adhesives have low heat resistance, when
solder reflow treatment at a temperature around 230°C is
performed in the course of the production of a piezoelectric
device, the oscillation frequency of the piezoelectric
element is changed. In addition, the piezoelectric
device thus produced has poor long-term thermal stability
under use.Moreover, it has been known to bond the piezoelectric
element to a substrate, using glass having a low
melting point. Even when glass having a low melting
point is used, heat treatment at a temperature of about
500°C or higher is required for obtaining a piezoelectric
device with high reliability; therefore, the coefficient
of thermal expansion of a substrate to which the piezoelectric
element is to be bonded is required to match
with that of a piezoelectric substrate of the piezoelectric
device. Furthermore, materials for the piezoelectric
device should be thermally stable at such a high
temperature (i.e., about 500°C or higher). As
