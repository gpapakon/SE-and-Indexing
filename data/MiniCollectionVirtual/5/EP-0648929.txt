<ABSTRACT>
A filter (10) for diesel fuel is proposed, which has a device for metered air reduction in order to prevent drive performance problems in diesel motor vehicles. In a housing (13) of the filter (10) a filter element (19) is connected between an inlet (16) and an outlet (17), on the clean side of which filter element an immersion pipe (26) extends downwards from the outlet (17), on the bottom opening (32) of which pipe a baffle element (33) is arranged. The fuel flowing into the immersion pipe (26) experiences an additional deflection, as a result of which improved de-aeration is achieved.

Liquid filter (10; 50; 60) for fuel, in particular
diesel fuel, having a housing (13) which, in addition

to an inlet (16) for the fuel, has an outlet (17) located
at the top of the housing (13), and having a filter

insert (19) which is arranged in the housing (13),
extends downwards from the outlet (17) and is arranged

such that it is situated, in the fuel stream which is to
be cleaned, between the inlet (16) and outlet (17), and

having a submerged pipe (26) which extends downwards from
the outlet (17), is arranged downstream of the filter

insert (19), on the clean side of the latter, and forms,
with the filter insert (19), a gas-collecting space (38)

which is connected to the outlet (17) via at least one

throttle opening (29) arranged in the submerged pipe (26)
for specific gas discharge, the submerged pipe (26)

having an opening (32) at the bottom, the fuel stream
being routed through said opening to the outlet (17),

characterized in that a deflection element (33, 51) is
arranged at the bottom opening (32) of the submerged

pipe (26) and causes the fuel stream flowing into the
submerged pipe (26) to be deflected upstream of the flow-in

location.
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, by means of its end (31) which is remote from

the outlet (17) and forms the opening (32), the submerged
pipe (26) projects at least into an area of the bottom

half of the filter insert (19), and the deflection
element (33, 51) is arranged there.
Liquid filter according to Claim 1 or 2, having
a submerged pipe which is open at the bottom end (31), 

characterized in that the deflection element (33) is
designed and arranged such that, in the annular

space (37) formed between the submerged pipe (26) and
central pipe (22) of the filter insert (19), it causes a

deflection of the fuel stream through at least 90°, in
particular through 180°.
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the filter insert (19) is designed

as a wound element (20) through which flow takes place
axially.
Liquid filter according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the deflection

element is designed as a plate-like deflection part (33)
which is introduced into the central pipe (22) and

covers, in particular, a downwardly oriented opening (32)
of the submerged pipe (26), and in that the deflection

part (33) has an annular web (35) which projects into the
annular space (37) and is located at a distance from the

submerged pipe (26) and central pipe (22), and in that
the deflection part (33) has through-openings (34)

located outside the web (35), and the end (31) of the
submerged pipe (26) has lateral through-passages (36).
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the bottom opening (32) in the

submerged pipe (26) is covered by a hat-shaped deflection
element (51) which comprises in particular, wholly or

partially, an air-repellent, but fuel-permeable, material
or screen.
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the throttle opening (29) is

arranged in the region of a venturi nozzle (28) which is
located, in particular, in the vicinity of the

outlet (17).
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the submerged pipe is designed as

a diffuser with a cross-section (62) which widens in the
direction of flow, and the throttle opening (29) is

arranged in the region of the larger cross-section.
