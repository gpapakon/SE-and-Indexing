<ABSTRACT>
The clamping device has a base (1), to be fixed to the workplace of the processing machine, and a work carrier (2) which can be mounted and clamped on the base. Orientation elements (13 - 20), interacting in pairs, at the base and at the work carrier orientate the work carrier (2) in three coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) perpendicular to one another and at the correct angle onto the base (1). There are three linear pairs (15, 16; 17, 18; 19, 20) of orientation elements for establishing the position in a coordinate plane (X-Y). Two of them are arranged at two opposite end areas of the device and together establish the position in the coordinate axis (Y) running transversely to the connecting line of the same. The third pair of orientation elements is arranged in the centre between the other two and establishes the position in the other coordinate axis (X). To clamp the work carrier in place, two clamping members (40, 41) are provided on the base (1). The clamping members (40, 41) are each arranged between an end linear pair of orientation elements and the centre linear pair of orientation elements. In this way, a compact type of construction of the clamping device and increased loading capacity of the same can be achieved with a minimum of linear pairs of orientation elements.
