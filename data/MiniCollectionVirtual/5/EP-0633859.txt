<CLAIMS>
Flask provided with a flow-reducing nozzle 
characterized in that said flask contains a liquid with a low 

to average viscosity comprised between 100 and 1000 mPa.s to 
be sprayed onto a surface, and in that the flow-reducing 

nozzle includes a tubular element (2) the end of which is 
provided with a slit-shaped opening (3) through which the 

liquid is sprayed. 
Flask according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
liquid is a liquid for household maintenance or for sanitary 

ware. 
Flask according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the slit extends over at least one side 

of the tubular element. 
Flask according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the slit extends at least over the 

sides of the tubular element. 
Flask according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the end contains several slits. 
Flask according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the end of the tubular element has a 

circular transversal section. 
Flask according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
end of the tubular element has a hemispherical shape. 
Flask according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the tubular element has an 

approximately square end section. 
Flask according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the flow-reducing nozzle is produced 

as one piece. 
Use of a flask according to one of claims 1 to 9 for 
the spraying of a liquid of low or average viscosity.
