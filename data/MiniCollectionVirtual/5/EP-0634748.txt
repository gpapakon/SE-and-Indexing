<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a disc 
cartridge apparatus, and more particularly, to a disc 
cartridge apparatus which rotatably accommodates a circular 
disc such as an optical recording disc, a magneto-optic 
recording disc and a magnetic disc, having a sliding shutter 
for covering/uncovering an opening defined for recording or 
reproducing signals therethrough to or from the disc, and to 
such a disc cartridge apparatus wherein the sliding shutter 
is slidably installed in the cartridge between a position 
where it covers the opening and positions spaced in one 
direction and another direction from the covering position, 
where it uncovers the opening. Conventionally a disc cartridge rotatably accommodates a 
circular disc such as an optical recording disc, a 
magneto-optic recording disc and a magnetic disc in a 
cartridge main body comprising an upper case-half and a 
lower case-half which are butt-joined with each other. In 
the cartridge main body accommodating the circular disc 
mentioned above, an opening confronting an optical pickup 
for recording and/or reproducing of an information signal is 
defined in the main body in extending in the radial  
 
direction from nearly the center of the disc. The opening 
also confronts a disc turntable of a disc driving apparatus 
for rotating the disc with the optical pickup. And on the 
cartridge main body, a shutter formed by a thin metal plate 
or an engineering plastics for opening and closing the 
opening, is slidably installed. Now, the sliding shutter installed therein is so 
arranged that the shutter will be located on a position 
where the opening is covered for protecting the disc when 
the cartridge main body is not loaded into an information 
recording reproducing apparatus containing the disc driving 
apparatus. For the object, a spring which gives the sliding 
shutter a bias force in the direction toward the covering 
position is provided in the cartridge main body. And in a 
cartridge wherein a sliding shutter is arranged to slide in 
both directions from a central position where it covers the 
opening to uncover the opening, the cartridge is further 
provided with a locking mechanism for blocking the sliding 
motion of the shutter at the covering position. Further 
when the cartridge is loaded into an information recording 
reproducing apparatus, the opening must be uncovered by 
easily and accurately sliding the shutter. Thus a shutter 
drive mechanism is required such two opposite functions. 
Though the cartridge must be
