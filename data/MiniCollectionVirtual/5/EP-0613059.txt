phenyl group; A represents aluminum, zinc or boron; R₁, 

R₂, and R₃ represent an alkyl group having a carbon 
number of 1 to 18; R₄ represents an alkylene group having 

a carbon number of 1 to 18; and X represents a sulfonic 
amide group or carboxylic amide group.)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for 
developing a latent image for use in electrophotography. In electrophotography, it is general practice 
to develop a latent image formed on a photoconductive 
medium by using a powder developer (toner) and fix the 
developed image on a base material (such as paper) by 
heat or pressure or otherwise. For such development 
purposes in electrophotography there has been used a two-component 
developer composed of a mixture of a toner 
comprising a colorant dispersed in natural resin or 
synthetic resin, and a carrier of iron or ferrite powder. 
A one-component developer has also been used which 
comprises a natural or synthetic resin material 
containing a colorant and a magnetic material. The two-component developer is such that a 
toner charged electrically by its friction with carrier 
is deposited on a latent image so that development is 
achieved, whereas the one-component developer is such 
that toner is charged electrically by its friction with a 
brush-like or plate-like member having a function similar 
to that of carrier, whereby a latent image is developed. 
It is required that toner be kept in a desired polarity  
 
according to the development system, positive or 
negative, for the photoconductive medium used. For this 
purpose, a so-called charge controller is usually added. In order to obtain improved image quality, 
development of toners of reduced particle size is 
currently in progress. In this connection, a so-called 
polymer toner is receiving attention which is produced by 
reacting monomers dispersed in an aqueous solution of 
protective colloid. However, charge controllers 
compatible with polymer toners are extremely limited and, 
in addition, many of them are colored substances, such as 
alloy dyes. Therefore, use of them in color toners is 
limited. This is found particularly noticeable with 
negatively charging charge controllers. Accordingly, the object of the present 
invention is to provide a toner including a colorless 
charge controller applicable for use in a polymer toner. According to the invention there is provided a 
toner comprising at least one charge controller expressed 
by the following formula: 
(where, Ph represents a substituted or non-substituted 
phenyl group; A represents aluminum, zinc or boron; R₁, 
R₂, and R₃, same or different, represent an alkyl group 
having a carbon number of 1 to 18; R₄ represents an 
alkylene group having a carbon number of 1 to 18; and X 
represents a sulfonic amide group or carboxylic
