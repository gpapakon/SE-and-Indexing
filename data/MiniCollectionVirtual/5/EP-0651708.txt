<ABSTRACT>
A test for an electronically controlled braking system, such as an adaptive braking system, is made to assure that the solenoids of each of the modulators (52, 54, 66, 68) are properly wired. According to the test, each modulator (52, 54, 66, 68) is tested in sequence. The exhaust solenoid of a modulator (52, 54, 66, 68) is actuated for 10 milliseconds, and the hold solenoid is then actuated for 30 milliseconds. If the modulator (52, 54, 66, 68) has been miswired, the exhaust solenoid will have been actuated for 30 milliseconds, thus generating a much louder "popping" sound than that generated by the other modulators (52, 54, 66, 68) will be immediately noticed and corrected.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR VERIFYING PROPER WIRING OF BRAKE PRESSURE MODULATORSThis invention relates to an adaptive or other electronically controlled braking system for an automotive vehicle equipped with pneumatically actuated brakes- Adaptive braking systems have become increasingly popular in recent years. Although the present invention may be used with adaptive braking systems, it is also intended for use with other electronically controlled braking systems, such as electropneumatic braking systems, whether or not such electropneumatic braking systems are also equipped with an adaptive braking subsystem.Of course, it is necessary to assure that adaptive braking systems work properly at all times. Accordingly, it has become common to provide a series of checks upon starting the vehicle to assure that the adaptive braking or other electronically braking system is working properly. One of these checks is to make sure that all of the solenoids which operate the valves controlling communication to the vehicle brakes are neither electrically open nor shorted. If such an open or shorted condition exists, the adaptive braking system is shut down and the vehicle driver is warned.The solenoid valves are a part of a brake pressure modulator. Each modulator includes an inlet or hold valve, which controls communication with a fluid pressure source, and an exhaust valve, which is actuatable to exhaust braking pressure to atmosphere. If the exhaust valve is actuated, the inlet or hold valve must also be actuated to keep from dumping the air supplied to the modulator from the pressure source to atmosphere. The adaptive braking system further includes an electronic control unit, which receives inputs from speed sensors which measure wheel speeds of the wheels of the vehicle. The electronic control unit or ECU processes these wheel speed signals to determine if one or more of the vehicle wheels is about to lock up. If such an incipient lockuo condition is sensed, the electronic control unit 

actuates the inlet or hold solenoid valve, which blocks communication between the pressure source and the brake actuator to thereby hold the pressure level then existing in the actuator, and may also dump the pressure in a brake actuator to atmosphere by simultaneously actuating both the hold and exhaust valves.Accordingly, there are three wires connecting the electronic control unit with each modulator. One wire is a source wire that supplies power to both solenoids; the second wire provides a ground to the inlet or hold valve

 CLAIMS
1. Method of testing an electronically controlled braking system to assure that exhaust and hold solenoids are properly wired, said electronically controlled braking system having an electronic control unit (70) and at least one modulator (52,54,66,68) controlled by said electronic control unit (70) for controlling the braking pressure of at least one of the wheels of the vehicle, said modulator (52,54,66,68) having a hold solenoid valve (96) for controlling communication between said modulator (52,54,66,68) and a pressure source and an exhaust solenoid valve (80) for controlling communication between said modulator (52,54,66,68) and ambient atmosphere, characterized in that said method comprises the steps of energizing one of the solenoid valves (80,96) for a predetermined time period, and energizing the other solenoid valve of said modulator (52,54,66,68) for a predecided time period significantly different from said predetermined time period after the predetermined time period has expired to permit pressure to exhaust through the exhaust solenoid valves (80) for one of said time periods if the exhaust and hold solenoid valves (80,96) are properly wired and for the other of said time periods if said exhaust and hold solenoid valves (80,96) are improperly wired, whereby the noise generated by pressure exhausting through said exhaust solenoid valve (80) for the other time period is significantly different from the noise generated by pressure exhausting through said exhaust solenoid valve (80) for said one time period, thereby alerting of a miswired solenoid valve condition. 2.
