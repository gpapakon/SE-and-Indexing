<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns the use of an asymmetrically porous membrane having progressively smaller 
pores from the upper surface to the lower surface as a reagent matrix layer in a test device for 

determining the amount of an analyte in such a way that a sample is applied to the large pore surface 
as well as a corresponding method for determining the amount of an analyte in a liquid sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved, disposable device for 
chemical analysis of liquids. More particularly, it concerns 
multilayer elements for determining the concentration of an analyte 
in a liquid. Multilayer test elements have been extensively used in 
laboratory environments to detect an analyte of interest. 
Semi-quantitative or qualitative analyses which do not involve 
sample size control, such as pregnancy tests, have been 
successfully adapted for use in the home or doctor's office. 
However, adapting quantitative tests for use by personnel without 
laboratory skills or without relatively expensive equipment has 
proven difficult. Unfortunately, detection of certain analytes 
such as glucose, alcohol or cholesterol requires quantitative tests 
which need to be relatively accurate to be useful. One difficulty in adapting quantitative tests has been accurate 
dosing of the test sample into or onto the assay device. One 
method of avoiding the need for control of sample size is 
performing analyses that determine the reaction rate rather than 
determining the amount of the analyte in the sample. Since 
reaction rates change with temperature and a number of other 
variables, simultaneous evaluation of controls has frequently been 
required. Additionally, two or more readings are required to 
calculate a rate. For assay of analytes such as glucose, cholesterol and alcohol, 
a blood sample is the preferred sample. To avoid processing the 
blood to obtain serum or plasma, many tests have been performed on 
whole blood. A particular problem encountered in quantitation of 
analytes in whole blood is the presence of red blood cells which 
causes interference in the detection of color changes of dyes that 
absorb in the same wavelength range as hemoglobin. Cellular  
 
components in blood have been blocked or filtered from the 
determining layer by a number of methods including use of 
cellulose, amino acids, glass fibers, or carbohydrate. Fluid 
metering with the concurrent removal of cellular components of 
blood has also been used. Additionally, barrier or blocking layers have been used to 
segregate cellular components from the serum portion of a whole 
blood sample. Such barriers used in prior art elements generally 
are required to be permeable to the ligand, the reagents of the 
reagent matrix layer, or products of their interaction. In such 
devices, determination of the detectable species is made from the 
detecting layer surface or determination surface of the reagent 
matrix layer on the

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining the amount of an analyte in a liquid sample compnsing applying the 
sample to the upper surface of reagent matrix layer which 

provides a determinate volume for sample and test reagents and 
is asymmetrically porous, having 

pores of progressively decreasing diameter from the upper surface to the lower surface of the 
reagent matrix layer and determining the amount of analyte from the lower surface of the reagent 

matrix layer. 
The method of claim 1 wherein excess sample liquid remaining on the upper surface of the 
reagent matrix layer after the reagent matrix layer is saturated with liquid sample and being in 

contact with the absorbent layer is absorbed by an absorbent layer. 
The method of claims 1 or 2 wherein the reagent matrix layer includes 3,5-dimethylaminobenzoic 
acid, 3-methyl-2-benzothiazoline hydrazone hydrochloride, glucose oxidase and peroxidase. 
Use of an asymmetrically, porous membrane 
providing a determinate volume for sample and test reagents and 

having progressively smaller pores from the upper 
surface to the lower surface as a reagent matrix layer in a test device in such a way that a sample 

is applied to the large pore surface.
