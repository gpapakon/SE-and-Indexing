<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent member comprises an absorbent core, a 
liquid permeable covering sheet and a reticulated sheet 

interposed between the absorbent core and the covering 
sheet 11, wherein the reticulated sheet has a relatively 

higher open ratio over at least an inwardly facing surface 
of the absorbent core than over any of oppsite side regions 

and opposite end regions thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent
member for use in absorbent articles such as disposable
diapers or sanitary napkins, and further relates to a
method of manufacturing such an absorbent member.Heretofore, absorbent bodies have been widely
used, which include a liquid permeable sheet such as a
tissue paper for covering an absorbent core comprising
fluff pulp or a mixture of fluff pulp and superabsorbent
polymer. Since the fluff pulp is of fine fibers and the
superabsorbent polymer is of powders or fine particles,
they are usually preformed into a core of desired shape
before they are covered with a tissue paper and the like to
facilitate handling thereof in the course of manufacturing
processes of the above-mentioned articles and also to
prevent fiber flocks and particles from leaking off the
articles during use thereof. For example, Japanese Kokai
(unexamined) Patent No. Sho 51-103545 teaches a general
matter on such a covering technique.In general, despite that absorbent bodies are 
covered with a tissue paper, the absorbent bodies tend to
lose their shapes as they absorb liquids which cause
entanglement of pulp fibers to come loose and the tissue
paper to break. This provides discomfort to users during
use and difficulties of handling thereof after use. One
measure to avoid such inconveniences is to improve a wet
strength of the absorbent body. For instance, Japanese
Kokai (unexamined) Patent No. Sho 57-82504 proposes to
prevent an absorbent body from losing its shape by covering
an absorbent core comprising fluff pulp with a reticulated
sheet formed of synthetic resin to form an absorbent body
and thereafter securing the reticulated sheet to an
inwardly facing surface of a backsheet of an article. U.s.
Patent No. 3,587,579 discloses a technique which covers
fluff pulp with a reticulated sheet such as a woven fabric
or a non-woven fabric of coarse meshes to form an absorbent
body having improved the tensile strength. This technique
also serves to prevent the absorbent body from losing its
shape. Document EP-A-0 523 719 is describing a bodyside
cover that includes two different materials to provide
good functionality. The bicomponent cover includes an
apertured first material, which is positioned along the
longitudinal central axis (x-x) of the absorbent article,
and a nonperforated second material secured to at least a
portion of the first material. The first material has a
rewet value which is less than, or equal to, the rewet
value of the second material while the second material is
softe
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An absorbent member (2) for an absorbent article
which has an absorbent member (2) interposed between a

liquid permeable topsheet (3) and a liquid impermeable
backsheet (4), said absorbent member (2) comprising:


an absorbent core (10)
a liquid permeable covering sheet (11) for
covering at least an inwardly facing surface of said

absorbent core; and
a reticulated sheet (12) interposed between
said absorbent core (10) and said covering sheet (11),

characterised in that said reticulated sheet (12) has a
relatively higher open ratio over a central region of

said inwardly facing surface than over any of opposite
lateral side regions and opposite longitudinal end

regions respectively surrounding said central region.
The absorbent member (2) of claim 1,
characterised in that said reticulated sheet (12) is

heat-bonded to one of said absorbent core (10) and said
covering sheet (11).
The absorbent member (2) of claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that said reticulated sheet (12) is a

laminated three-layer sheet which comprises a central
layer sheet having a relatively higher melting point,

upper and lower layer sheets having melting points lower
than the melting point of said central layer. 
A method for manufacturing an absorbent member (2)
which has an absorbent core, a liquid permeable covering sheet (11) and a

reticulated sheet (12) for covering the absorbent core (10) and is
adapted to be interposed between a liquid permeable

topsheet (3) and a liquid impermeable backsheet (4) of an absorbent
article, said method comprising the steps of:


(a) applying to a continuously delivered,
thermoplastic synthetic resin sheet a number of slits

arranged in a moving direction of said resin sheet in a
predetermined patterned manner;
(b) stretching said resin sheet to form said
reticulated sheet (12) having a transverse central region

having a relatively high open ratio;
(c) locating said central region of the reticulated
sheet (12) over a central region of an inwardly facing surface

of said absorbent core (10) to cover said absorbent core (10); and
(d) covering said absorbent core (10) and said reticulated
sheet (12) with said covering sheet (11).
The method of Claim 4 further comprising a step of
heat-bonding said reticulated sheet (12) to one of said

absorbent core (10) and said covering sheet (11).
