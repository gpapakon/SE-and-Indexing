<ABSTRACT>
Homo- and copolymers of ethylene endowed with very high 
molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions

metallocene is stereorigid and it is in its meso isomeric 
form.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of olefin polymers. In particular, it relates to a
process for the preparation of ethylene homo- and copolymers
having very high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight
distributions.It is known that the properties of ethylene homopolymers
and of copolymers of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefin
comonomers depend on their molecular weight. The use of these
polymers in fields such as, for example, the production of
films, generally requires that they be endowed with high molecular
weights.The above mentioned ethylene polymers are generally prepared
in the presence of catalysts of Ziegler-Natta type. The
polymer thus obtained have a wide molecular weight
distribution.More recently, in processes for the preparation of polymers
of ethylene, homogeneous catalysts based on metallocene
compounds have been used. The polymers obtained by working in
the presence of these catalysts, have a narrow molecular
weight distribution, but their molecular weights are not
always industrially acceptable.Only when working under particular conditions and in the
presence of particular metallocene catalysts such as, for
example, metallocene compounds of hafnium, it is possible to
obtain ethylene polymers having higher molecular weights. In the international patent application WO 91/02012, for
example, there is described a process for the preparation of
high density linear polyethylene having high molecular weight
and narrow molecular weight distribution, in the presence of
bis(cyclopentadienyl)hafnium compounds and a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate
salt. However, in this application only
the preparation of ethylene homopolymers is exemplified.Metallocene compounds wherein the ligands consist of two
substituted cyclopentadienyls linked between them by a bridging
group which gives steric rigidity to the molecule, are
known to be stereospecific catalyst components for the preparation
of isotactic polyolefins. These metallocenes can exist
in two sterical configurations, that is the racemic and the
meso isomeric form. As the chiral racemic form only is
stereospecific, the meso form is generally removed by separation
from the rac/meso mixtures obtained from the metallocene
synthesis.It has now been surprisingly found that it is possible to
prepare homo- and copolymers of ethylene having very high molecular
weights as well as narrow molecular weight distributions
if the polymerization reaction is carried out in the
presence of a metallocene-based catalyst wherein
