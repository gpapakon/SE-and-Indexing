<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly (21) is disclosed for use with a housing (H) which defines a 
fluid chamber (C) and a threaded opening (O). In threaded engagement with the 

opening is a threaded portion (13) of a device such as a sensor assembly (11). 
The housing defines a counterbore (CB) disposed axially between the threaded 

opening (O) and an external surface (S). The seal assembly (21) includes a metal 
support member (23) including a cylindrical portion (27) having inner (33) and 

outer (35) portions of elastomeric sealing material. The seal assembly is pressed 
into the counterbore and, by means of the interference fit therebetween, may be 

permanently retained therein. As the member is threaded into the opening, the 
underside (16) of the head (15) deforms a sealing lip (39) radially inward into 

engagement with the threaded portion (13). As a result, the threaded member 
may be removed and replaced by another, without loss of sealing function, and 

without the need to replace the conventional, prior art O-ring seal which would 
normally be retained on the threaded member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the sealing art, and more particularly, to
devices of the type in which a member is in threaded engagement with a threaded
opening formed in a housing which contains fluid, which must be retained within
the housing.Although the sealing arrangement of the present invention is adapted for use
in many types of devices, it is especially suited for use with mechanical devices
such as vehicle transmissions, and will be described in connection therewith. On
vehicle transmissions, there is frequently a need to install a threaded member, such
as a speedometer sensor, into threaded engagement with the housing of the
transmission. If the device contains fluid, such as water or lubricant oil, it is
necessary to provide a sealing arrangement around the threaded member, in order
to prevent leakage of the fluid from within the housing of the device to the exterior
thereof. The invention is applicable to devices wherein the fluid within the housing
is at substantially atmospheric pressure, as well as to devices wherein the fluid is
typically at a positive pressure.In some such applications, any one of a number of well known gasket
designs may be sufficient, but in various other applications, the use of a gasket is
not practical. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a typical gasket design
requires that there be a fairly large clamping or sealing area between two
members. Therefore, the present invention is especially suited for applications in
which the member being sealed (e.g., a threaded speedometer sensor) does not
provide sufficient clamping area between itself and the adjacent member (e.g., the
transmission housing) to permit the use of a conventional gasket assembly.In such applications, it has been conventional to install an O-ring at the
junction of the threaded portion and the head of the threaded member, such that
the O-ring remains with that particular threaded member. In some applications, the
use of such an O-ring is acceptable, but in various other applications, where the 
threaded member is occasionally replaced, the use of an O-ring which remains
with the threaded member is not acceptable, because if the O-ring is not
transferred to the replacement threaded member, or a new O-ring is not provided
with the new threaded member, the result will be a loss of satisfactory sealing.A seal arrangement to be disposed in a counter bore of a housing
surrounding a threaded connector, and in sealing engagement with the underside
of the head of the connector, is known from

A fluid sealing means locatable in a housing means (H) defining a fluid
chamber (C) adapted to contain fluid; said housing means defining a

threaded opening (O) adapted to provide fluid communication between said
fluid chamber (C) and the exterior of said housing means; a member (11)

operably associated with said housing means (H) and including a threaded
portion (13) in threaded engagement with said threaded opening, said

threaded portion defining a nominal diameter (D1), and said member (11)
further including an enlarged portion (15) extending beyond said nominal

diameter (D1), said enlarged portion having an underside (16) disposed
adjacent an exterior surface (S) of said housing means and surrounding

said threaded opening (O); and sealing means (21) including a generally
cylindrical portion (27) and an elastomeric sealing material (25) disposed

between said threaded opening and said threaded portion, and adapted to
prevent communication of fluid between said fluid chamber (C) and the

exterior of said housing means; the fluid sealing means characterized by:

(a) the sealing means locatable in said threaded opening (O) in a seal
receiving portion (CB) disposed adjacent said exterior surface (S) of

said housing means (H);
(b) said sealing means (21) including a generally annular, rigid support
member (23) including said generally cylindrical portion (27) disposed

within said seal receiving portion (CB);
(c) an elastomeric sealing material (25) disposed about at least a major
portion of said rigid support member (23), including both an inner

portion (33) and an outer portion (35) disposed about said generally
cylindrical portion (27), said sealing material disposed about said

inner portion defining a diameter (D2) greater than said nominal
diameter (D1);
