<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adhesive stick, having a piston which supports the stick substance and having a sleeve which surrounds the stick substance, in which the drive device for moving the stick substance upwards and downwards is designed in the form of a connecting rod which is linked to the piston and is linked at the other end to an actuating element which can be actuated outside the sleeve. The drive element can be designed as a rod (2, 18A, 30, 40, 52) or as a flexible band (2C). The actuating element can be designed as a double ring (3), as a knee joint (17), as a tongue-shaped double wheel (32), as a wheel (41) or as an at least semicircular solid wheel (53). According to a preferred embodiment, the drive element, together with the linked piston and the actuating element, is designed as a one-piece injection moulding which is inserted in the sleeve from the open side for the assembly of the adhesive stick, whereupon the adhesive stick substance is poured into the hollow space in the sleeve from above and is anchored on or in the piston while it solidifies.
