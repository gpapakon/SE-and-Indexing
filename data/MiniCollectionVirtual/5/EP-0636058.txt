<ABSTRACT>
A cassette (10a, 10b, 11), which contains juxtaposed wire staple blanks releasably interconnected to form at least one strip (8) of staple blanks, is adapted to be used in a stapler for driving staples into an object, such as a sheaf of papers. The stapler comprises a base and a stapler head movable in relation to the base. The cassette accommodates a reciprocating staple shaper (20), adapted to successively shape the staple blanks of the strip (8) into U-shaped staples, and a reciprocating staple driver (19), adapted to successively release the thus-formed staples from the strip (8) and drive them into an object. The cassette has a front wall (11) in which the staple shaper (20) and the staple driver (19) are displaceably guided, as well as recesses through which projections on the staple shaper and the staple driver project, so as to engage, when the cassette is mounted in the stapler head, a drive mechanism (4) arranged in the stapler head to reciprocate the staple shaper and the staple driver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cassette which 
contains juxtaposed wire staple blanks releasably inter-connected 
to form at least one strip of staple blanks and 
which is adapted to be used in a stapler for driving staples 
into an object, such as a sheaf of papers, said stapler 
comprising a base, a stapler head movable in relation 
to the base, and a drive mechanism for reciprocating 
both a reciprocating staple shaper arranged to successively 
shape the staple blanks of the strip into substantially 
U-shaped staples, and a reciprocating staple driver 
arranged to successively release the thus-formed staples 
from the strip and drive them into an object, cf. e.g. EP-A-0 448 255. Usually, conventional staplers have a base, a stapler 
head pivotably connected to the base, and a magazine 
arranged in the stapler head and containing U-shaped staples 
disposed close to one another in a long row. Naturally, 
the largest number of staples in the magazine may 
vary from one stapler to another, but generally is in the 
order of a few hundreds. To increase the largest number of staples with which 
to charge the stapler, the magazine in electrically driven 
staplers, which are very common, has been replaced with a 
cassette containing juxtaposed wire staple blanks releasably 
interconnected to form at least one strip of staple 
blanks. When the staple blanks form several strips, these 
are comparatively short and in the form of plates stacked 
in the cassette. Also, the staple blanks may form a single 
long strip rolled up into a roll. Prior-art cassettes containing 
plates of staple blanks are disclosed in EP-A1-0 
366 094 and US-4,623,082, and prior-art cassettes containing 
a rolled-up strip of staple blanks are disclosed 
in US-4,570,841, US-4,573,625, US-4,588,121, US-4,720,033 
and US-4,770,334. Such a cassette may contain several 
thousands of staple blanks.  
 In much-used cassette-equipped staplers, the staple 
shaper, serving to shape the staple blanks into U-shaped 
staples, and the staple driver, serving to expel the 
U-shaped staples, are worn and have to be replaced after 
some time. To replace these components in the prior-art 
staplers is a very complicated operation and has to be 
performed by specially trained personnel. Another disadvantage 
of the known staplers is that trained personnel 
sometimes has to be sent for also when a staple has got 
stuck in the stapler. This is so because it is difficult 
to get at the stuck staple, which sometimes may only be 
removed after the dismounting

<CLAIMS>
A cassette (6) which contains juxtaposed wire staple 
blanks releasably interconnected to form at least one 

strip (8) of staple blanks and which is adapted to be used 
in a stapler for driving staples into an object (37), such 

as a sheaf of papers, said stapler comprising a base (1), 
a stapler head (2) movable in relation to the base, and a 

drive mechanism (4) for reciprocating both a reciprocating 
staple shaper (20) arranged to successively shape the 

staple blanks of the strip (8) into substantially U-shaped 
staples, and a reciprocating staple driver (19) arranged 

to successively release the thus-formed staples from the 
strip and drive them into an object (37), 
characterised
 
in that the cassette (6) accommodates the staple shaper 

(20) and the staple driver (19), that the cassette (6) 
has a front wall 

(11) in which the staple shaper (20) and the staple driver 
(19) are displaceably guided, as well as recesses through 

which projections on the staple shaper (20) and the staple 
driver (19) project, and that the cassette (6) is designed to be so 

mounted in the stapler head (2) that the staple shaper 
(20) and the staple driver (19) with their projections 

engage the drive mechanism (4) to be reciprocated thereby. 
A cassette as set forth in claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that it is composed of a casing (10) in 

which the strip (8) is provided and which has a front 
opening (14) for discharging the strip (8), and a front 

plate (11) which forms the front wall and is releasably 
attached to the casing (10) over the discharge opening 

(14) and which has, in the side facing the casing, means 
(18, 21, 22, 23) for guiding the staple shaper (20) and 

the staple driver (19).
