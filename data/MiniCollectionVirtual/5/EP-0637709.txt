<ABSTRACT>
The mixing valve corresponds to the type which comprises two 
flat ceramic plates (4,5), adapted onto each other, where one 

of said plates (4) 
is fixed and is provided with openings (13,14) for the hot and 

cold water and 
another opening (15) for the mixed water, the movable plate (5) being 

provided 
with a single opening to provide variable communication between said 

hot and cold water inlets (13,14) as well as for varying the free 
flow area 

of the outlet opening (15), characterized in that the fixed plate is 
provided with a curved rebate (16), concentric with the water outlet hole 

(15) leading to the tap, to which water is fed via a channel-type 
prolongation (17) of the adjustment cavity of the movable plate 

(5), such that 
the region of contact between the two plates (4,5), opposite the water 

inlet side, remains constantly wet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
single control mixing valve which provides appreciable 
characteristics of novelty and inventive step relative 
to other types currently known in the field. Single control mixing valves are being used increasingly 
in bathrooms and the like due to the many 
advantages which they provided relative to traditional 
valves, in particular in terms of their ease of operation, 
good seal for preventing leaks and the fact that 
they maintain the hot/cold water mix setting even in 
the closed position, etc. Said single control mixing valves consist essentially 
of two superposed ceramic discs or plates 
fitted inside a housing or assembled within the body 
of the tap. One of said plates is fixed whilst the 
other is moveable and can be actuated according to two 
types of movement, one of which is rotational and 
enables the temperature of the of the mixed water to 
be adjusted, the other being rectilinear and is for 
adjusting the flow rate of the tap. The fixed plate includes the two inlets for hot 
and cold water respectively, said inlets being 
arranged in the form of a circular curve, and along 
which the movable plate can be moved such that when it 
rotates so as to gradually open the hot water inlet it 
increases the temperature of the mixture, at the same 
time closing the cold water inlet and vice versa when 
the temperature of the water coming out of the tap is 
to be reduced. Single control mixing values of the type defined in the 
preamble of claim 1 are already known. In the known types of valve there is always a  
 
region of the 
movable plate that is wet due to contact with the inlets of the fixed 
plate but, given the high degree of watertightness between the two 
superposed plates, the region furthest away from said inlets works by 
sliding in the dry once the initial film of oil has disappeared due 
to the repeated sliding operations that take place between the two 
plates. One of the main objectives of the present invention is that the 
entire surface of the movable plate acts in wet conditions and 
therefore with a smoother sliding operation. The present invention 
therefore foresees that the fixed plate has a curved rebate, 
concentric with the water outlet hole, and that the adjustment cavity of 
the movable plate has a prolongation by means of which said rebate of 
the fixed plate fills up with liquid each time the tap is closed,  
 
thereby wetting the corresponding region of the movable plate. The valve that forms the object of the present invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A single control mixing valve, of the type which comprises 
inside a casing (1,2,3) two flat ceramic plates 

(4,5), adapted onto each other, where one (4) of said 
plates is fixed and provided with inlet openings (13,14) 

for hot and cold water and an outlet opening (15) for 
mixed water leading to a tap, the other plate (5) being 

movable and provided with a single opening in the form 
of an adjustment cavity to provide variable communication 

between said hot and cold water inlets (13,14) as 
well as for varying the free flow area of the outlet 

opening (15),
 
characterized in that the fixed plate (4) is provided 

with a curved rebate (16), concentric with the water 
outlet opening (15), to which water is fed via a 

channel-type prolongation (17) of the adjustment cavity 
of the movable plate (5), such that the region of contact 

between the two plates (4,5), opposite the water 
inlet side, remains constantly wet.  

 
A single-control mixing valve according 
to claim
 1, characterized in that 
gaskets fitted to the lower cover (3) of the casing in order to make the 

water inlet openings (13, 14) and the mixed water outlet opening (15) 
watertight, are provided in some part of its design 

with a double wall (24, 25, 25') defining chambers (28, 27, 27'), to which the 
water has no access, for absorbing the vibrations of 

the liquid flow and at the same time for channelling 
said liquid and thereby preventing turbulence at the 

inlet and outlet of the valve. 
A single-control mixing valve according 
to claim 2, characterized in that the gaskets of 

the hot and cold water inlet openings (13, 14) and mixed water 
outlet opening (15) of the lower cover (3) constitute a 

individual piece made of elastomeric ring-shaped 
elements, each provided in some part of their design 

with a double wall defining chambers for absorbing the 
vibrations and channelling the flow of liquid in order to 

reduce turbulence.
