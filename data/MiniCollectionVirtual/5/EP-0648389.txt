<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oscillator in combination with a frequency doubler which is 
capable of receiving four input signals in quadrature and 
combining them to produce a pair of antiphase output signals at 
twice the input frequency. European Patent Application Publication No. 0671086, published 
under the PCT as WO94/01945, constitutes state of the art 
according to Article 54 (3) of the EPC, and discloses a phase lock 
delay line, and a delay line clock frequency doubler. International Journal of Electronics, vol. 48, no. 1, 1980, 
London, GB, pages 43-45 discloses a simple digital frequency 
multiplier which doubles the frequency of an input signal. The 
multiplier operates only for a frequency depending on 
predetermined values set for RC filters used in the circuit. It comprises 
three NAND gates to supply one output signal having a duty cycle of 50%. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 32, no. 12, May 1990, 
pages 149-151, New York, US, "Pulse Combining Network" discloses 
a frequency doubler circuit which generates true and complement 
outputs with negligible skew, using complex logic circuitry. According to the present invention there is provided in 
combination, an oscillator arranged to generate first to fourth 
signals which are 90° apart in phase and which have a duty cycle of 
50%, and a frequency doubler circuit comprising: a first 
set of logic gates including a first NAND gate connected to 
receive the first and second input signals, a second NAND gate 
connected to receive the second and third input signals, a third 
NAND gate connected to receive the third and fourth input signals 
and a fourth NAND gate connected to receive the first and fourth 
input signals; and a second set of logic gates including a fifth 
NAND gate connected to receive the outputs of the first and third 
NAND gates and a sixth NAND gate connected to receive the outputs 
of the second and fourth NAND gates; wherein the fifth and sixth 
NAND gates supply as their outputs two signals in antiphase at 
twice the frequency of the input signals.  
 The switching frequency of the logic gates will limit the maximum 
operating frequency of the circuit. NAND gates are preferred 
because they have a fast switching speed. The frequency doubler confers a particular advantage when used 
to double the frequency of quadrature outputs of a quadrature 
oscillator, which outputs are subject to buffering and 
conversion. It is usually difficult to make the oscillator, 
buffer and convertor operate fast enough but
