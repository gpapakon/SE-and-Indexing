<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electroluminescent 
laminates and methods of manufacturing same. The invention 
also relates to electroluminescent display panels providing 
for electrical connection from the electroluminescent 
laminate to voltage driving circuitry. The invention 
further relates to laser scribing a pattern in a planar 
laminate such as the address lines of the transparent 
electrode of an electroluminescent laminate. Electroluminescence (EL) is the emission of light 
from a phosphor due to the application of an electric field. 
Electroluminescent devices have utility as lamps and 
displays. Currently, electroluminescent devices are used in 
flat panel display systems, involving either pre-defined 
character shapes or individually addressable pixels in a 
rectangular matrix. Pioneering work in electroluminescence was done at 
GTE Sylvania. An AC voltage was applied to powder or 
dispersion type EL devices in which a light emitting 
phosphor powder was imbedded in an organic binder deposited 
on a glass substrate and covered with a transparent 
electrode. These powder or dispersion type EL devices are 
generally characterized by low brightness and other problems 
which have prevented widespread use. Thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) devices were 
developed in the 1950's. The basic structure of an AC 
thin layer EL laminate is well known, see for example 
Tornqvist, R.O. "Thin-Film Electroluminescent Displays", 
Society for Information Display, 1989, International 
Symposium Seminar Lecture Notes, and U.S. Patent 
4,857,802 to Fuyama et al. A phosphor layer is sandwiched 
between a pair of electrodes and separated from the 
electrodes by respective insulating/dielectric  
 
layers. Most commonly, the phosphor material is ZnS 
with Mn included as an activator (dopant). The ZnS:Mn 
TFEL is yellow emitting. Other colour phosphors have 
been developed. The layers of conventional TFEL laminates are 
deposited on a substrate, usually glass. Deposition of 
the layers is done sequentially by known thin film 
techniques, for example electron beam (EB) vacuum 
evaporation or sputtering and, more recently, by atomic 
layer epitaxy (ALE). The thickness of the entire TFEL 
laminate is only in the order of one or two microns. To separate and electrically insulate the 
phosphor layer from the electrodes, various 
insulating/dielectric materials are known and used, as 
discussed in more detail hereinafter. Each of the two electrodes differ, depending 
on whether it is at the "rear" or the "front" (viewing)
