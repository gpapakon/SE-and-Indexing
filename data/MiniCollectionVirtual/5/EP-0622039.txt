<ABSTRACT>
A percolator cup (1)(30) for espresso coffee 
machines, wherein a cup-shaped casing (2) defines a 

compartment (25) for ground coffee, and an outlet 
(7)(45) separated from the compartment (25) by a 

calibrated valve element (24)(51) which only connects 
the compartment (25) to the outlet (7)(45) when the 

pressure inside the compartment (25) exceeds a given 
value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a percolator cup, 
particularly for espresso coffee machines. In espresso coffee machines, the ground coffee is 
placed inside a filter cup housed removably inside a cup 
having at least one outlet conduit at the bottom, and 
connectable at the top, normally by means of a bayonet 
joint, to the outlet of a hot water supply device 
normally consisting of a boiler. Correct performance of a machine of the 
aforementioned type depends on the grain size and the 
amount of ground coffee employed, and the extent to 
which it is compressed inside the filter cup. All of 
which factors combine to form, inside the filter cup, a 
wafer of such volume and consistency as to impede, when 
impregnated with hot water, outflow of the hot water 
through the outlet at the bottom, and generate inside 
the cup a pressure of normally about 10-12 atmospheres. 
It is known, in fact, that the quality of the espresso 
coffee produced depends on the temperature and pressure 
of the water or steam inside the percolator cup, and  
 
that no froth (which is the mark of a good espresso 
coffee) is formed below the above pressures. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a percolator cup for producing frothy espresso 
coffee regardless of the grain size and the amount of 
ground coffee employed, and the extent to which it is 
compressed inside the cup. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a percolator cup for espresso coffee machines, 
comprising a cup-shaped casing defining a compartment 
for ground coffee; and an outlet by which the 
compartment communicates externally; characterized by 
the fact that it also comprises normally-closed 
calibrated valve means between said compartment and said 
outlet, for only connecting the compartment to the 
outlet when the pressure inside the compartment is above 
a given threshold value. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a first preferred 
embodiment of the percolator cup according to the 
present invention; Figure 2 shows a section along line II-II in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 shows a plan view of a second preferred 
embodiment of the percolator cup according to the 
present invention;  Figure 4 shows a section along line IV-IV in 
Figure 3; Figure 5 shows a section along line V-V in Figure 
3. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a percolator cup 
comprising a cup-shaped casing 2, and a straight handle

<CLAIMS>
A percolator cup (1)(30) for espresso coffee 
machines, comprising a cup-shaped casing (2) defining a 

compartment (25) for ground coffee; and an outlet 
(7)(45) by which the compartment (25) communicates 

externally; characterized by the fact that it also 
comprises normally-closed calibrated valve means 

(24)(51) between said compartment (25) and said outlet 
(7)(45), for only connecting the compartment (25) to the 

outlet (7)(45) when the pressure inside the compartment 
(25) is above a given threshold value. 
A cup (1)(30) as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that said casing (2) defines a 

first (25) and second (26) chamber separated by said 
valve means (24)(51); said first chamber (25) coinciding 

with said compartment (25); and said second chamber (26) 
communicating with said outlet (7)(45). 
A cup (1) as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that it comprises a tubular insert (17) of 

inoxidizable material housed inside said casing (2) to 
define a surface of said first chamber (25). 
A cup (1)(30) as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized by the fact that it comprises a seat (21) 

for supporting said valve means (24)(51) and enabling 
communication between said two chambers (25, 26); the 

valve means (24)(51) being housed inside said second 
chamber (26). 
A cup (1)(30) as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized by the fact that the valve means (24)(51) 

comprise a plate (22)(52), and thrust means (27)(53) for 
maintaining a peripheral portion of the plate (22)(52) 

frontally contacting said seat (21) with a given 
pressure. 
A cup (1) as claimed in Claim 5, characterized 
by the fact that said thrust means (27) are elastic 

means (27). 
A cup (1) as claimed in Claim 6, characterized 
by the fact that said elastic means (27) comprise at 

least a spring (27) housed inside said second chamber 
(26) and interposed between said plate (22) and a wall 

(6) of said second chamber (26). 
A cup (30) as claimed in Claim 5, characterized 
by the fact that said plate (52) is an elastic plate 

mounted in axially-sliding manner inside the second 
chamber (26); the thrust means (53) comprising a spacer 

(53) interposed between the plate (52) and a surface 
(48) of the second chamber (26) substantially parallel 

to the plate (52), and pressing axially on a central 
portion of the plate (52) for maintaining said 

peripheral portion of the plate (52) frontally 
contacting said seat (21) with said given pressure. 
A cup (30) as claimed in Claim 8, characterized 
by the fact that said casing (2) comprises a tubular 

upper body (31) having an intermediate inner annular 
shoulder facing downwards and defining said seat (21);
