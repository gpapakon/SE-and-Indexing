<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus is described for forming a tungsten 
silicide layer
 on a semiconductor wafer (102) in a 
deposition chamber which comprises mounting a wafer (102) 

on a susceptor (110) having a fixed outer diameter 
regardless of the diameter wafer thereon to be processed in 

said chamber, and flowing into a deposition chamber a 
mixture of gases, including dichlorosilane gas and a 

gaseous source of tungsten through a fixed gas inlet 
pattern formed in a fixed diameter inlet receptacle, 

whereby a constant gas flow will be maintained in the 
deposition chamber regardless of wafer diameter being 

processed to thereby provide uniform deposition conditions 
in the deposition chamber, independent of wafer diameter. 

In this manner the same showerhead (2) is used for all 
diameters of wafers, and while the susceptor (110) is 

changed with each size of wafer (102) to be processed, to 
thereby provide a crown pattern (112) on the susceptor 

(110) corresponding to the diameter of the wafer (102) 
being processed, the same outer diameter is used for each 

susceptor (110), thereby providing the same dimensioned gap 
(84) in the same position between the outer edge of the 

susceptor and a baffle plate (80) surrounding the susceptor 
(110), so that the gas flow patterns in the deposition 

chamber remain constant during deposition, regardless of 
wafer diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process and apparatus for forming tungsten silicide on a 
semiconductor wafer. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for 
forming tungsten silicide from a gaseous mixture comprising dichlorosilane and a 
tungsten-containing gas wherein constant gas flow conditions are maintained in a 
deposition chamber regardless of wafer diameter size. In the CVD processes for the depositions of materials, such as, for example, a 
tungsten silicide CVD process, on semiconductor wafers, the common practice is to 
provide a separate pattern of inlet gas flow for each size wafer to be processed, which 
to some extent, matches the diameter of the particular wafer. For example, for a 
wafer of approximately 200 mm diameter (∼8 inch), typically a 200 mm (∼7.92 inch) 
diameter gas inlet structure, commonly referred to as a showerhead, and generally 
illustrated at 2, in Figure 1A, is typically provided with a 200 mm (∼7.92 inch) 
diameter pattern of 0.71 mm (0.028 inch) diameter inlet holes, each spaced apart a 
distance of about 4.57 mm (0.18 inches). When a wafer of approximately 150 mm diameter (∼6 inch) is processed, a 
showerhead of the same outer diameter is conventionally used, as generally illustrated 
at 4 in Figure 1B, but the showerhead is now provided with a correspondingly smaller 
hole pattern (but with the same diameter individual holes) for the admission of 
process gas into the deposition chamber, even though the same size (inner diameter) 
chamber is used. Thus, for a 150 mm diameter wafer, the gas inlet hole pattern is 
usually also about 150 mm in diameter. Similarly, for a wafer of approximately 125 
mm diameter (∼5 inch), the showerhead, generally illustrated at 6 in Figure 1C, has  
 
the same outer diameter, but the showerhead is provided with a 125 mm diameter 
hole pattern for the admission of process gas into the chamber, and an approximately 
100 mm (∼4 inch) diameter wafer, as generally illustrated at 8 in Figure 1D, is 
provided with a showerhead (of identical outer diameter) with a 100 mm diameter 
pattern of inlet gas holes. Side by side comparisons of the gas flow patterns of the 
four different prior art susceptors shown in Figures 1A-1D shows the respective gas 
flows from the respective showerheads, as indicated by the arrows. It will be readily 
appreciated that both the gas flow pattern and total volume of gas entering the 
deposition chamber vary considerably with the difference in wafer diameter in the 
tungsten silicide deposition process
