<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided on an Integrated Multiport Repeater (IMR) to monitor 
the activity of the IMR when the repeater is in minimum mode. Through this 

system the serial output pin outputs status based upon inputs at two input pin the 
signal in and the clock signal. In a preferred embodiment there are four different 

status outputs, partition, loopback/link, Bitrate and SQE/Polarity. This system finds 
use in low end applications where complex control circuitry is not desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to monitoring the port activity of an
Integrated Multiport Repeater and preferably to the monitoring of such
activity when the repeater is in minimum mode.Figure 1 is a block diagram of a conventional Local Area Network (LAN)
10 of a type proliferating in the computing market. These LANs permit a Data
Terminal Equipment (DTE) 12 a computer or business machine which provides
data in a digital form, to transfer data and control information with other DTEs 12,
Communication from a first DTE 12 to a second DTE 12 is implemented by use of
Data Communications Equipment (DCE) 14 which provide functions required to
establish, maintain and terminate a connection. DCE 14 provides whatever signal
conversion or processing that is necessary or desirable.There are two interfaces which are important to understand. These include
a DTE/DCE interface 16 and a DCE/DCE interface 18, commonly referred to a
transmission channel, or medium. For proper and reliable communication, a set of
rules for communication between like processes, which provide a means of
controlling information transfer between stations (DTEs) on a datalink, known as a
protocol are implemented.A popular protocol referred to as Carrier Sensing, Multiple Access, 
Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) has been commercially successful. This protocol
permits multiple stations to access a LAN system. Each station, before
transmitting, will sense of a carrier signal indicating that the network presently is
being used to transmit a message. If it senses the carrier signal, transmission will
not be initiated.It is possible, due to time delays in propagating a signal from a DTE 12
that two transmissions will overlap. This overlap is referred to as a collision,
which will be detected by DCEs 14 on the network. Upon detecting a collision, all
transmissions will be terminated and DTEs 12 desiring to transmit will wait a
random period of time before attempting to transmit again. This protocol is further
defined in IEEE Standard 802.3, hereby expressly incorporated by reference for all
purposes, which sets forth requirements for the DTE/DCE interface 16, referenced
as an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI). The IEEE Standard 802.3 defines a system
which is similar to Ethernet, a registered trademark of Xerox Corporation.Repeaters are utilized in a LAN network to amplify or regenerate signals
passed in the network to compensate for losses. Repeaters will also re-synchronize
signals as necessary. Integrated Multiport Repeaters (IMR's) have
