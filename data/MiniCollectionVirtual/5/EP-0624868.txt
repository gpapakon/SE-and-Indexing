<ABSTRACT>
In an artificial superlattice magnetoresistance effect 
element 1 in which two or more of magnetic thin film layers 

M
n
 having different coercive forces are stacked with 
intervening of a non-magnetic film layer N
n-1
 and resistance 
changes depending on directions of magnetization in adjacent 

magnetic thin film layers by utilizing differences in the 
coercive forces, the element is characterized in that an 

anisotropy magnetic field Hk is increased by reducing a 
thickness of a soft magnetic layer, anisotropy in the 

magnetic thin film layer is obtained by forming the magnetic 
thin film layer in a magnetic field to thus increase the Hk, 

a material having large Hk is used as a soft magnetic 
material for the soft magnetic layer, and further the 

anisotropy is obtained by reducing a pattern width into 1-30 
Âµm to thus increase the Hk. The element exhibits the 

resistance change in the neighborhood of a zero magnetic 
field and requires no bias mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetoresistance
effect element or magnetoresistive element for reading
magnetic field intensity as signals in a magnetically
recorded medium and a method of fabricating the same, and in
more particular to a magnetoresistance effect element which
is fabricated with a magnetoresistive film having high rate
of change in resistance in a small external magnetic field
and a method of fabricating the same.In these years, in association with an advance in a
high sensitivity in magnetic field sensors and a high
density in magnetic recordings, the development of magnetic
field sensors of magnetoresistance effect type (hereinafter
referred to as "MR sensor") and magnetic heads of
magnetoresistance effect type (hereinafter referred to as
"MR head") arises increasingly. The MR sensor and MR head
read external magnetic signals through the resistance change
in a reading sensor part comprising a magnetic material.
However, in the MR sensor and MR head, the relative speed
thereof with respect to a magnetic recording medium does not
depend on a regenerative or reproducing output and thus the
MR sensor achieves a high sensitivity and the MR head
attains a high output even in case of a high density 
magnetic recording.Recently, a magnetoresistance effect element comprising
two or more of magnetic thin layers which are stacked with
intervening a non-magnetic thin layer therebetween, wherein
adjacent magnetic thin layers through the non-magnetic thin
layer have different coercive forces and the element
exhibits a large magnetoresistance change in a small
external magnetic field, has been taught in Unexamined
Japanese Patent Publication Hei 4-218982 (EP 0 483 373 A1).
This magnetorsistance effect element has a high resistance
change rate of several % to several tens % in a small
external magnetic field of the order of several Oe to
several tens Oe.The magnetoresistance effect element as described in
the above publication can be operated by application of the
small external magnetic field. However, if the element is
used for practical sensors and magnetic heads, it was
necessary to set bias layers on the upper and lower sides of
the element or to apply an external bias magnetic field
thereto.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a magnetoresistance effect element in which the
resistance change is achieved in the neighborhood of zero
magnetic field even if bias mechanism does not exist. This object is achieved by a magnetoresistance effect element
as defined in claim
