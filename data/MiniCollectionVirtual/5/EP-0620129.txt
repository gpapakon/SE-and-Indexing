<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a carcass (6) composed 
of at least one carcass ply (6A,6B) extending from 

a tread part (2) through sidewalls (3) and folded 
around a bead core (5) of a bead part (4), and a 

belt layer (7) disposed radially outside the 
carcass (6) and composed of two belt plies (7a,7b) 

overlaid inside and outside in the radial direction 
characterised by a vibration resistant rubber 

layer (9) disposed between the inner belt ply (7a) 
and the carcass ply (6), wherein the outer belt ply 

width WB1 which is the distance between the outer 
edges in the axial direction of the outer belt ply 

(7b) is 80 to 90% of the tread width WT, the inner 
belt ply width WB2 of the inner belt ply (7a) is 

greater than the outer ply width WB1 and is 90 to 
100% of the tread width WT, and the vibration 

resistant rubber layer (9) has a JISA hardness 
greater by 3 to 30 degrees than the topping rubber 

of the carcass ply (6) and the inner and outer belt 
plies (7a,7b), a thickness T of 0.9 to 2.5 mm and a  

 
rubber width WR which is the distance between the 

outer edges in the axial direction of 0.6 to 1.1 
times the inner ply width WB2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
preferably usable on a four-wheel drive vehicle, 
providing in particular reduced pass-by noise 
without sacrificing performance on a snow-covered 
road. Tyre noise reduction is keenly demanded recently, 
as can be seen in EP-A-0 300 779, corresponding to the 
preamble of claim 1, and to decrease pass-by noise, it has 
been suggested in the past to reduce the hardness of the 
topping rubber of the belt or the tread rubber, or 
to decrease the volume of the tread pattern 
grooves. However, when the hardness of the topping rubber of 
the belt is decreased, the constraining force of 
the belt layer decreases, and cornering power is 
lowered, which results in deterioration of steering 
stability. Also decreasing the hardness of the 
tread rubber is also limited by steering stability, 
and the pass-by noise cannot be decreased 
sufficiently.  
 Furthermore, when the groove volume is decreased, 
the grip performance and braking performance may be 
sacrificed especially when travelling snow-covered 
roads, and hence it cannot be used practicably in a 
snow tyre or a M+S (mud and snow) tyre. On the other hand, pass-by noise is generated when 
the resonant sound caused in the air column between 
the road surface and the grooves is transmitted in 
the air, and also when the vibration caused by the 
tyre contacting the ground is transmitted from the 
tread to the sidewall. In the latter case, members 
such as tread rubber, the belt reinforcement and 
the sidewall rubber are individually able to easily 
transmit the frequency range. Thus, to reduce the 
pass-by noise, it is necessary to lower the sound 
pressure level in the frequency region of 800 Hz to 
1 kHz, and the present inventor discovered that the 
member particularly effective at transmitting the 
vibration in this frequency region is the belt 
layer. That is, he found that suppression of 
generation of vibration in the belt layer 
contributes greatly to reduction of pass-by noise. 
Also, he found that the vibration of the belt layer  
 
is suppressed by placing a harder rubber layer 
between the belt and carcass than the topping 
rubber. It is hence a primary object of the invention to 
present a pneumatic tyre capable of effectively 
lowering the sound pressure level in the frequency 
region of 800 Hz to 1 kHz According to the present invention, 
a pneumatic tyre comprises a carcass composed of at 
least one carcass ply extending from a tread part
