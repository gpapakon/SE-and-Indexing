<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical disc has a resin substrate 
and a magneto-optical film. A birefringence 

distribution of the substrate in a static state is so 
set that a disc phase difference during rotation of the 

disc is kept at a level of substantially zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical 
disc which is a mass storage information 
recording medium. The magneto-optical disc is a mass storage 
information recording medium for recording or 
reproducing information in such a process that a 
magneto-optical film having the magnetic Kerr effect is 
formed on a transparent substrate, a linearly polarized 
laser beam is irradiated onto the film through the 
substrate, and a fine angle of Kerr rotation caused by 
the magneto-optical film is read out. The disc of this 
type has a distribution of birefringence along the 
surface of substrate. In use of the disc, the 
birefringence causes a reflected laser beam to have a 
phase difference between ordinary ray component and 
extraordinary ray component thereof so as to become 
elliptically polarized light. It decreases the 
amplitude of magneto-optical signals, raising a problem 
of lowering the signal level. It is thus considered 
that the transparent substrate should preferably have 
the birefringence as close to zero as possible. Generally employed as a material for the  
 
transparent substrate are glass, epoxy resins, acrylic 
resins, and polycarbonate resins. A currently most 
generally used method for forming the substrate is the 
injection molding highest in productivity. Popularly 
used among the resins are the polycarbonate resins 
stablest in heat resistance, water absorption property 
and other mechanical properties. The polycarbonate 
resins are materials which are normally considered as 
liable to cause the birefringence because of the 
orientation arising from the molecular structure 
thereof. However, various technical progresses 
achieved heretofore reduced the birefringence of 
polycarbonate substrate down to a level of nearly zero. 
For example, an improved polycarbonate resin has the 
flowability several times higher than the polycarbonate 
resins of general-purpose grade, which greatly reduced 
the birefringence. On the other hand, the injection 
molding machine has been improved to develop a disc 
molding machine with high-speed and high-responsibility 
injection capability, enabling stable molding. Also, a 
disc mold or die is improved as to permit uniform 
control of die temperature and to obtain suitable gate 
cross section and disc gate cutting, so that the 
birefringence can be of nearly zero even with the 
substrate being made of the polycarbonate resin. Inventors made magneto-optical disc substrates 
of a polycarbonate resin low in birefringence utilizing  
 
the above
