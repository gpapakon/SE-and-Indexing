<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of structural building materials, 
and more particularly to a fabricated structural beam. A variety of types of structural beams are used in non-residential 
construction. Some examples include fabricated wooden girders, laminated 
wood beams and reinforced concrete beams. By far, the most commonly 
used material is structural steel of various cross sections, such as "I"-section, 
"H"-section, "C"-section, "Z"-section and channel section. These 
structural steel shapes are most commonly manufactured by hot or cold 
rolling processes and generally provide a relatively heavy beam for a 
given load carrying capacity. Structural sections fabricated from sheet steel are used in some 
construction applications. For example, it is now a common practice to 
utilize fabricated steel studs, particularly in non-residential construction. 
These are generally made from galvanized steel sheet, cold-rolled into a 
"C"-section or channel section. Furthermore, corrugated or fluted steel 
sheets are widely used in flooring and roofing applications.  Certain other fabricated structural shapes are known in the prior art. 
For example, Figure 1 illustrates a prior art structural shape fabricated 
from sheet steel. Beam 1 comprises a web portion 2 and opposing head 
portions 3 and 4. As can he clearly seen in the illustration, beam 1 can be 
easily fabricated from a single flat sheet of steel by rolling or otherwise 
folding the sheet longitudinally. It should be noted that edges 5 and 6 of 
the sheet are folded back towards web portion 2, but are not fastened or 
otherwise secured thereto. A prior art beam such as beam 1 has a very 
limited load bearing capability. It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide a 
fabricated structural beam that has a load carrying capability comparable 
to that of conventional hot or cold rolled structural steel sections, but 
which is light in weight compared to a conventional section of equal load 
carrying capability.  According to the invention there is provided 
an elongate structural member for building construction 
consisting of four members comprising: a pair of web 
members each having a cross section having a center 
section, a pair of leg members each angled in the same 
direction at an acute angle from the center section and 
a pair of flange mounts each angled from the leg members 
so as to be parallel to each other; said web members 
being joined only to each other along their length in 
facing abutment so that said joined
