<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides that wire mesh cage structures are 
used to provide structural blocks usable in building, 

shoring, walls and the like. The cage is lined with a geo-textile 
fibrous material which allows the passage 

therethrough of water, but not particulate material such as 
cement, sand aggregate which are used as materials for 

filling the cage. The cage is of rectangular form with 
internal partition panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cage structures useful for 
providing building and shoring structures in the form of 
blocks, and in particular concerns cage structures erectible 
and fillable on site to provide the building and shoring 
blocks. Conventional cage structures are known by the name "gabions" 
and comprise essentially wire mesh cages defining a block 
shape, which are filled with rock, stone and rubble and the 
like. The stone is generally placed inside the cage 
structure so as to be visible through the cage, and in this 
connection the stone typically is dressed and laid in the 
nature of a wall so as to have an enhanced appearance, as 
frequently the stone surfaces are left exposed to view. This 
may apply for example when the gabions are used, as they are 
extensively, for the shoring up of an embankment for example 
adjacent a motorway or for forming a sea defence or the like. Although these gabions are made up of wire mesh cages filled 
with stone and other rubble, in effect they become solid 
blocks which can be used for building, shorings for 
hillsides, sea walls and the like, for walls and for other 
purposes. In British Patent Specification 845,863 cage structures to 
form structural blocks, which can be used as gabions are 
disclosed and these cages are erected on site from a 
flattened form to an erected form and are then filled. The 
cage structures are made up of open mesh work panels which 
are hinged together to form a 'blank' in the flattened form 
and to erect the cage structures on site some of the panels, 
to form side panels are folded upwardly and the edges are  
 
then connected together by wires. The method of erecting the known cages however on site is 
time consuming and labour intensive, which can be a 
disadvantage in circumstances such as in military 
applications where speed of erection is important. The present invention seeks to provide a cage structure 
erectible on site to provide a structural block in a rapid 
and effecient manner. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a 
cage structure which is for use at a site where the structure 
will be filled with sand, soil and other building material, 
wherein the cage structure is made up of pivotally 
interconnected open mesh work panels which are connected 
together under factory conditions so that the cage can take a 
flattened form for transportation to site where it can be 
erected to take a form in which panels thereof define side 
and end walls and an open top through which the cage

<CLAIMS>
A cage structure which is for use at a site where the 
structure will be filled with sand, soil and other building 

material, wherein the cage structure is made up of pivotally 
interconnected open mesh work panels (90-96), which are 

connected together under factory conditions so that the cage 
can take a flattened form for transportation to site where it 

can be erected to take a form in which panels (90-96) 
thereof define side and end walls and an open top through 

which the cage structure can be filled and under said factory 
conditions said panels (90-96) defining the cage side and end 

walls are pivotally interconnected edge to edge and are 
relatively foldable to lie face to face in the flattened form 

for transportation to site, and can be relatively unfolded to 
bring the cage to the erected condition without the 

requirement for any further interconnection of the side and 
end walls (90-96) on site, characterised in that the side 

walls each comprise a flat single panel (90,92) and said side 
walls (90, 92) are connected by partition panels (98,100) 

pivotally connected thereto, the cage structure being adapted 
to be erected on site by pulling it apart by the end walls 

(94,96) and when it is moved from the flattened form to the 
erected condition the side panels (90,92) define with the end 

walls and partition panels T(98,100) an elongated wall 
structure having a row of cavitites to be filled with said 

building material and of which each partition panel (98,100) 
is common to the pair of cavities adjacent the partition 

panel (98,100). 
A cage structure according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the cage structure includes a base panel (108) pivotally 

connected to a lower edge of one of the side walls (90). 
A cage structure according to any of claim 1 or 2, 
 

characterised by a lining material lying to the inside of 
said 
side and end walls to enable the cage to be filled with 
a particulate material which would pass through the open mesh 

work panels (90,- 96) were it not for the presence of the 
lining material. 
A cage according to claim 3, characterised in that said 
lining material is connected to the insides of the panels 

(90,- 96) forming the side and end walls of the cage and 
folds with the folding of the cage panels between the 

flattened and erected conditions. 
A cage according to claims 3 or 4, characterised in that 
said lining material comprises a geo-textile felt material. 
A cage structure according to any of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the lining material (138) is attached 

to the cage walls by means of clips. 
A cage structure according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the panels are pivotally interconnected by spirally 

wound rods.
