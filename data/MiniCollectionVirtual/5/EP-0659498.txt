<ABSTRACT>
Bending assembly of a bending machine (13), which can be 
employed to make upstream or downstream, clockwise or 

anticlockwise, bends of up to 180째 and more, on a bundle of 
bars (14) stacked on each other and lying on a plane 

substantially perpendicular to a working surface (15), the 
bending assembly (10) comprising an abutment plate (16) with 

two opposed abutment pins (17) and a rotary bending plate 
(11) coaxial with, and external to, the abutment plate (16) 

and including a bending pin (12), the abutment pins (17) and 
bending pin (12) having their axes substantially at a right 

angle to the working surface (15), the abutment plate (16) 
being able to rotate on its own perpendicular axis and 

including the two diametrically opposed abutment pins (17) 
with a space between those two abutment pins (17) at least 

equal to the diameter of the bars forming the bundle (14) of 
bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a bending assembly of a bending
machine, as set forth in the main claim.The bending assembly is applied to machines which bend
iron products for building work, whether those products are
made from bars or rolls, but which advantageously process
round, ribbed or shaped bars.The bending assembly according to the invention is fitted
advantageously, but not only, to bending machines of the
type disclosed in EP-A-0.501.212.The bending machines to which this invention is applied
are normally used to bend in four directions bundles of bars
in which the bars are stacked on each other vertically so as
to produce the same geometric configuration from each bar of
the bundle, these geometric configurations being used in
building work as stirrups for the reinforcement of
reinforced concrete.The bundle of bars is fed in these bending machines until
it cooperates with a bending assembly, which is suitably
actuated to make the desired bend.In the following text the word "upstream" means the
position upstream of the bending assembly, whereas the word
"downstream" means the position downstream of the bending
assembly.In the state of the art the bending assemblies consist of
a stationary abutment pin and of a bending pin which rotates
about the abutment pin to bend the bundle of bars.The bending assembly consists of a rotary bending plate on
which is located a bending pin substantially perpendicular
to the rotary bending plate, the pin being offset from the
central axis of rotation of the rotary bending plate.US-A-4,049,026 discloses a bending assembly consisting of 
two stationary abutment elements coupled to define a feed
channel along which the bundle of bars to be bent is fed.
These abutment elements have their righthand end suitably
shaped as a semi-circle, against which the bundle of bars is
rested when being bent by a bending pin positioned
downstream of the abutment elements and moved by the
rotation of the rotary bending plate.This first form of embodiment enables downstream bends,
whether clockwise or anticlockwise, to be made and in
particular makes also possible the formation of downstream
bends of 180째 in most cases.In some cases, where the bars consist of certain
materials, it is impossible to make 180째 bends with such
types of abutment elements. This embodiment also does not
enable any upstream bend to be made.The above patent discloses another bending machine able to
make downstream and upstream bends; in this machine the
abutment assembly with which the bar cooperates during the
ben

Bending assembly of a bending machine (13), which can be
employed to make upstream or downstream, clockwise or

anticlockwise, bends of up to 180째 and more, on a bundle of

abutment plate (16) has a first position (16a) for

introduction of the bundle of bars (14), with the abutment
pins (17) positioned at the sides of the lengthwise axis of

the bundle (14) of bars, a second working position (16b) and

a third working position (16c), with the abutment pins (17)
rested against the bundle of bars (14) on the opposite faces

of that bundle (14).
