<ABSTRACT>
A unit (1) for the production of flat glass products, in 
which a bench (13) for supporting at least one glass 

sheet (2) is carried by a motor-driven carriage (7) which 
is movable towards and away from a station (3) from which 

the sheets (2) are picked up; the bench (13) carrying a 
pick-up head (18) for picking up and moving the sheets 

(2) and an assembly (34, 38) for scoring and snapping off 
the sheets (2), being hinged to the carriage (7) to rock 

between a raised, loading position, in which it can 
receive the sheets (2) in succession from the pick-up 

head (18) and a lowered, operative position in which it 
supports the sheets (2) during the scoring and snapping 

of the sheets (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unit for the 
production of flat glass products. Normally flat glass products are made from glass sheets 
on production lines which include a store for housing a 
plurality of sheets; a scoring station at which each 
sheet is scored with a plurality of lines; and a 
breaking, or snapping, station at which each sheet is 
snapped along the score lines to produce a plurality of 
flat products. In known production lines of the type described above, 
the taking of the sheets from the store and the 
successive transfer of the sheets to the scoring station 
above a rocking support bench are usually carried out by 
means of a pick-up head, generally of a suction-cup type. 
which, in most applications, is moved by a bridge 
overlying the production line or alternatively by a 
loading carriage moved automatically or by an operator. Known production lines of the type described above, even 
though they are used since they are efficient and 
reliable from a functional point of view, suffer from the 
disadvantage of being very bulky and expensive to produce 
and assemble as well as to maintain.  The object of the present invention is to provide a unit 
for the production of flat glass products which solves 
the problems relating to known production lines in a 
simple and economic manner. According to the present invention there is provided a 
unit for the production of flat glass products, the unit 
including a support frame; a bench for supporting at 
least one glass sheet, the bench being pivotally 
connected to the frame for pivoting relative to the frame 
itself about an axis; and actuator means interposed 
between the frame and the bench for rocking the bench 
about the said axis; and being characterised in that it 
further includes a first carriage for supporting the 
frame, first drive means for moving the first carriage 
towards and away from a station at which the glass sheet 
is picked up and moving and pick-up means carried by the 
bench for coupling positively with the sheet to take the 
sheet from the pick-up station and to deposit the sheet 
on the bench. In the unit defined above, the bench is preferably 
connected to the frame for pivoting about the said axis 
between a lowered, operative position in which the bench 
is located in a substantially horizontal position, and a 
raised, loading position in which the bench is pivoted 
from its operative position through an angle greater than 
90° into a position into which it is substantially  
 
parallel to the glass
