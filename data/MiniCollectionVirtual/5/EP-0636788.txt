<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a positive-displacement piston pump, with an axial piston (3) driven in a reciprocating linear motion within the body (1) of the pump by a cam-type mechanism which is moved in rotation about an axis (14) coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the piston and which acts on one of the ends of the said piston while the latter is permanently urged in the opposite direction by an elastic means (8), this pump especially being noteworthy in that the cam-type mechanism includes a double cam (11) and that the end of the piston which points towards the said cam rests on a transverse small bar (7) which is fixed in rotation but guided in translation in the direction of motion of the piston, the said small bar resting on the cam (11) so that the latter, in combination with the elastic means (8), imparts a reciprocating rectilinear motion to the said small bar (7) and to the piston (3).

A volumetric pump (3) with an axial piston driven in a reciprocating 
linear movement in the body (1) of the pump by a cam mechanism which is 

driven in rotation about an axis (14) coaxial to the longitudinal axis of 
the piston and which acts on one of the ends of the said piston while this 

latter is urged continuously in the opposite direction by elastic means 
(8), characterised in that it is provided with a deformable reservoir (16) 

filled with fluid, in that the cam mechanism has a double cam (11) and in 
that the end of the piston turned towards the said cam rests on a 

transverse bar (7) fixed in rotation but guided in translation in the 
direction of the movement of the piston, the said bar resting on the cam 

(11), in such a way that this latter, in combination with the elastic means 
(8), communicates to the said bar (7) and to the piston (3), a 

reciprocating linear movement which allows the fluid from the said 
reservoir (16) to be displaced towards a load circuit (1',4). 
A pump in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that the cam (11) 
is provided with a tail piece (12) itself driven in rotation. 
A pump in accordance with one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in that 
the cam (11) is driven in rotation by an electric motor (22). 
A pump in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the bar (7) rests directly on the cam (11) which slides, on turning, on the 

said bar (7). 
A pump in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that 
the bar (7) rests on the cam (11) by means of rollers (10) with which it is 

equipped, in such a way that the said rollers (10) turn on contact with the 
said cam (11). 
A pump in accordance with claim 5 characterised in that the bar (11) 
has two rollers (10) arranged at its ends and which are fastened by a 

spacer sleeve (7'). 
A pump in accordance with one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that 
the deformable reservoir (16) is annular and surrounds at least one part of 

the body (1) of the pump in which the piston is fitted. 
A pump in accordance with claim 7 characterised in that the reservoir 
is made up from a membrane (16') fixed in a fluidtight manner onto the body 

(1) or a part solidly attached to the latter in such a way as to separate 
the hydraulic circuit imperviously from the mechanical part comprising in 

particular the bar (7), the cam (11) and the corresponding end of the 
piston (3). 
A pump in accordance with one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
it is intended to displace the fluid from the reservoir (16) towards the 

body (1') of an hydraulic jack.
