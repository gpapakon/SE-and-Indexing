<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an optical isolator, 
which has satisfactory isolation performance, is small in 

size, and can be produced at low cost. The optical 
isolator of the present invention comprises two polarizing 

elements consisting of a birefringence crystal plate 11 in 
forward direction and a glass polarizing plate 13 in 

backward direction, and a Faraday rotator 12. Because only 
one glass polarizing plate is required, which is expensive, 

it can be produced at lower cost while maintaining isolation 
performance approximately equal to that of a conventional 

type optical isolator with two glass polarizing plates. 
Compared with conventional type optical isolator with 

polarizing beam splitter, the optical isolator of the 
present invention has better isolation performance and is 

produced in smaller size. Thus, it is possible to provide 
an optical isolator, which has satisfactory isolation 

performance, is small in size, and can be produced at lower 
cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical isolator, 
and in particular to a polarization-dependent optical 
isolator used in optical communication and optical 
transmission. In semiconductor laser used in the applications such as 
optical communication, laser light is reflected at 
connecting point of optical fiber or on optical component 
parts and returns to the semiconductor laser. By this so-called 
returning light, frequency characteristics are 
decreased or noise increases, and this often leads to 
difficulties to provide high quality optical transmission. 
For this reason, an optical isolator is required, which 
allows the light to pass only in forward direction and shuts 
off the returning light in backward direction. Figs. 2 (a) and (b) each represents schematical 
perspective view of an arrangement of a polarization-dependent 
isolator known as a representative optical 
isolator, showing direction of polarization plane of light 
in forward and backward directions. This optical isolator 
comprises a Faraday rotator 22 disposed in the middle, and 
two polarizing elements, consisting of a polarizer 21 
(polarizing element in forward direction) aligned on light  
 
source side with respect to the Faraday rotator 22 and an 
analyzer 23 (polarizing element in backward direction) 
aligned on opposite side of the light source. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), incident light coming in 
forward direction from a light source is generally not 
polarized. When it passes through a polarizer 21, it is 
turned to a linearly polarized component only, having a 
specific plane of polarization due to effect of the 
polarizer 21. This linearly polarized light 24 passes 
through Faraday rotator 22 and enters an analyzer 23 after 
the plane of polarization has been rotated by 45 degrees. 
Because rotational angular positions of the polarizer 21 
and the analyzer 23 around optical axis are determined at 
such angular relation that the linearly polarized light 25 
coming through the Faraday rotator 22 passes through the 
analyzer 23, and the light coming through the polarizer 21 
passes through the analyzer 23 without any substantial 
loss. When this optical isolator is integrated with 
semiconductor laser, polarization plane direction of the 
light passing through the polarizer 21 is equalized with 
polarization plane direction of laser light from 
semiconductor laser. On the other hand, returning light 26 coming from 
backward direction toward the analyzer 23 is the polarizing 
component only, which can pass through the
