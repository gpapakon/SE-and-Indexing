<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of
a colored toner blend using toners which contain blend compatibility
components to provide colored toners with improved blending or comixing characteristics.Developer compositions with charge enhancing additives, which impart a positive
charge to the toner resin, are known. Thus, for example, there is described in U.S. Patent
3,893,935 the use of quaternary ammonium salts as charge control agents for electrostatic
toner compositions. In this patent, there are disclosed quaternary ammonium compounds with
four R substituents on the nitrogen atom, which substituents represent an aliphatic
hydrocarbon group having 7 or less, and preferably about 3 to about 7 carbon atoms, including
straight and branch chain aliphatic hydrocarbon atoms, and wherein X represents an anionic
function including, according to this patent, a variety of conventional anionic moieties such as
halides, phosphates, acetates, nitrates, benzoates, methylsulfates, perchloride,
tetrafluoroborate, benzene sulfonate, and the like. Also of interest is U.S. Patent 4,221,856,
which discloses electrophotographic toners containing resin compatible quaternary
ammonium compounds in which at least two R radicals are hydrocarbons having from 8 to
about 22 carbon atoms, and each other R is a hydrogen or hydrocarbon radical with from 1 to
about 8 carbon atoms, and A is an anion, for example sulfate, sulfonate, nitrate, borate,
chlorate, and the halogens such as iodide, chloride and bromide, reference the Abstract of the
Disclosure and column 3. A similar disclosure is presented in U.S. Patent 4,312,933, which is a
division of U.S. Patent 4,291,111; and in U.S. Patent 4,291,112 wherein A is an anion including,
for example, sulfate, sulfonate, nitrate, borate, chlorate, and the halogens. There are also
described in U.S. Patent 2,986,521 reversal developer compositions comprised of toner resin
particles coated with finely divided colloidal silica. According to the disclosure of this patent,
the development of electrostatic latent images on negatively charged surfaces is accomplished
by applying a developer composition having a positively charged triboelectric relationship with
respect to the colloidal silica.Also, there are illustrated in U.S. Patent 4,338,390, developer compositions
containing as charge enhancing additives organic sulfate and sulfonates, which additives can
impart a positive charge to the toner composition. Further, there is disclosed in U.S. Patent
4,298,672,
