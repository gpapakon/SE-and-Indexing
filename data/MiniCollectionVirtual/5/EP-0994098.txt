<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
ferrielectric liquid crystal compound suitable for use
in an active matrix-type liquid crystal display device
in which a liquid crystal is driven for each pixel
independently, and to its use.A liquid crystal display device (LCD) has been
being widely used as a flat panel display as a
substitute for a conventional Braun tube (CRT) display,
mainly in portable machines and equipment. Along with
the recent expansion of the functions of personal
computers and word processors and with the recent
increase in the capacity of data processing, LCD is also
required to have higher functions, that is, to have
functions such as a large display capacity, a full-color
display, a wide viewing angle, a high-speed response and
a high contrast.As a liquid crystal display method (liquid
crystal driving method) to comply with such requirements,
there has been proposed and, in some areas, is
practically used an active matrix (AM) display device
which works by a method in which thin film transistors
(TFT) or diodes (MIM) are formed such that one
transistor or diode corresponds to one pixel on a
display screen and a liquid crystal is driven for one
pixel independently of another.Although the above display method has problems
that it is difficult to decrease a cost due to a low
production yield and that it is difficult to form a 
large-sized display screen, the above display method is
about to surpass an STN display method which has been so
far a mainstream and to overtake CRT due to its high
display quality.However, the above AM display device has the
following problems due to the use of a TN (twisted
nematic) liquid crystal as a liquid crystal material.
(1) A TN liquid crystal is a nematic liquid
crystal, and the response speed is generally low
(several tens ms), so that no good image quality can be
obtained in the display of video rate.(2) A twisted state (twist alignment) of liquid
crystal molecules is used for displaying, and the
viewing angle is therefore narrow. In displaying with a
gray scale in particular, the viewing angle becomes
sharply narrowed. That is, the contrast ratio, the color
or the like changes depending upon viewing angles to a
display screen.
For overcoming the above problems, there have
been, in recent years, proposed AM panels which use a
ferroelectric liquid crystal or an anti-ferroelectric
liquid crystal in place of the TN liquid crystal
(Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications Nos. JP-A-5-249502,
JP-A-5-150257 and JP-A-6-95080). At present,
however, the
