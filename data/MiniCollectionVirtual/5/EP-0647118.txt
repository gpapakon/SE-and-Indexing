<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a blood pressure transducer in medical 
measuring instruments. Invasive direct blood pressure measurement is often performed on 
patients in the intensive care unit or the coronary care unit of a hospital, during 
heart surgery, and so forth. This method can observe the blood pressure 
waveform with a higher level of accuracy than a non-invasive indirect blood 
pressure transducer, and can also measure a local pressure such as an internal 
pressure of the heart. The following three systems have been employed for this 
purpose and are examples of invasive direct blood pressure transducers. Figs. 
10 and 11, discussed below, are explanatory views of conventional systems. 
Hereinafter, these three systems and their drawbacks will be explained. This first system is illustrated in Fig. 10 and is the most widely used 
type at present. The transducers of this type have been put on the market by a 
large number of manufacturers. A catheter 1 filled with a physiological saline 
solution through a pressure tube 2 is inserted into a blood vessel of the arm of a 
patient, and the other end of the pressure tube 2 is connected to a 
semiconductor pressure transducer 3. This transducer 3 detects the change of 
the pressure of the saline solution, and a monitor 4 observes the change of the 
blood pressure. This system is convenient and can accurately measure a patient's blood 
pressure for an extended period of time. Since many of the transducers are of 
a disposable type, there is a less danger of infection to others. Nonetheless,  
 
since the semiconductor pressure transducer 3 is of an electrical type, there is 
the danger of electric shock to the patient due to the failure of the apparatus, 
and the like. Furthermore, since the semiconductor pressure transducers 3 are 
complicated in structure, the problem of the high production cost is left 
unsolved when using them as a disposable device. This second system is shown in Fig. 11. A small semiconductor 
pressure transducer 5 is assembled into the tip of a catheter 1, and the pressure 
of a local portion (e.g. internal chamber of the heart, large blood vessels, etc) 
is observed by a monitor unit 4 by inserting the catheter 1 into the blood vessel 
or chamber. The physiological saline solution is charged into a pressure tube 2 
in the same way as in the first system. This system, too, has already been put 
on the market. According to this system, however, it is difficult to produce a probe 
having as small a diameter as the catheter 1.
