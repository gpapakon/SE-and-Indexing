<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for exchanging data processing capabilities 
between computers. The computers exchange capabilities so that data transfer 

between the computers may be made in the most efficient data format possible for the 
two computers. A first computer, which will receive a data file, sends a list of data 

processing capabilities to a second computer, which will transmit the data file to the 
first computer. The transmitting computer examines the capabilities list of the 

receiving computer as well as its own capabilities list and determines the most 

efficient data format for the transfer. The transmitting computer may process the data 
file into an intermediate format for efficient data transfer so that the receiving 

computer will process the intermediate data file into the desired data format. The 
capabilities list can be cached for future communication between the computers. The 

system can update the capabilities list and inform other computers whether their 
cached capabilities list is current. Capabilities can also be forwarded from one 

computer to another so that a third computer can determine the capabilities of the first 
computer from the second computer or the capabilities of the second computer from 

the first computer. The system is readily applicable to facsimile machines where 
custom and application data processing capabilities can be exchanged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a system and method for 
exchanging information related to data processing capabilities between 
computers. Computers are commonly used in the workplace for data 
processing and storage. Access to computer information is a key element in the 
successful use of computers. Communication between computers has become a 
critical aspect of access to the computer information. A local area network 
(LAN) allows several computers to be coupled together to enhance their 
computing capability. One computer can access information stored in another 
computer through the LAN. When information is exchanged between two 
computers, the information must be in a format that the computers can recognize 
and process. Information is often exchanged in a standard format such as ASCII, 
for example. However, an ASCII format exchange may require that the 
information be converted from its original format to ASCII format. The 
computer transferring information has no way of determining the data processing 
capabilities of the receiving computer and, therefore, must convert the 
information to ASCII on the assumption that ASCII is a "universal" format that 
all computers can recognize. One form of computer is a facsimile (FAX) machine. A FAX 
machine may comprise an interface board within a computer, or may be a stand-alone 
device employing well-known computer technology. FAX machines are 
used to transfer information from one location to another. FAX machines of 
older design had little or no computing power and were limited to scanning a 
page and transmitting a digitized version of the page to a receiving FAX machine 
that reproduced the page. Modern FAX machines are essentially a form of 
computer and often have storage capability allowing the FAX machine to scan a 
document and store the digitized version of the machine for transmission at a 
later time, such as when telephone rates decrease at night. The receiving FAX  
 
machine can store received messages that are confidential and print them out 
only when the proper identification code is entered. To minimize transmission time, FAX machines use data 
compression techniques well known in the art. An international standard for 
facsimile transmission has been established by the International Telegraph and 
Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and published as Terminal 
Equipment and Protocols for Telematic Services (1989). References to CCITT 
standards are made throughout this disclosure. These standards are well known 
to those
