<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a hinge (5) with latchbolt (thrustbolt) (6) for connecting two pivotable leaves (1, 2) of a door, in particular all-glass door, said hinge is intended, when the latch bolt (6) is in the extended state, to be automatically supported on the ground. For this purpose, the displaceable and arrestable latch bolt (6) can be displaced in a virtually cylindrical, at least two-part housing (9, 10, 11). The two part-housings (9 to 11) can be rotated with respect to one another. Arranged in the housing (9 to 11) is a first lifting element (disc 17) which is designed as a sliding element and is supported on a second lifting element (disc 18) which is likewise arranged in the housing and has an oblique plane (19). The first lifting element (disc 17) is in connection with a first of the two part-housings (9). The second lifting element (18) is in connection with a second of the two part-housings (10) and with the displaceable latch bolt (6). Consequently, upon rotation of the two part-housings (9 to 11) with respect to one another, the latch bolt (6) is automatically retracted or extended.
