<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound oxide possessing 
especially excellent oxygen absorbing and desorbing 
capability and utilizable for a catalyst for purifying exhaust 
gas and for ceramics as well as a method for preparing same. From the past, a cerium oxide is used in large quantities 
for catalysts for purifying exhaust gas and for ceramics, and in 
the filed of catalysts, for example, for enhancing the purification 
rate of exhaust gas components such as hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide and NOx taking advantage of the characteristic 
property of cerium oxide capable of absorbing oxygen in an 
oxidative atmosphere and desorbing oxygen in a reducing 
atmosphere, while in the filed of ceramics, for use in 
electroconductive ceramics such as solid electrolytes taking 
advantage of the aforesaid characteristic property of cerium 
oxide. Such cerium oxide heretofore known is usually prepared, 
for example, by adding oxalic acid or ammonium bicarbonate to a 
solution of nitrate or hydrochloride of cerium, filtering and 
washing the resultant precipitate and drying followed by baking 
it. However, a conventional oxide composed predominantly of 
cerium oxide prepared according to the above method, though it  
 
possesses oxygen absorbing and desorbing capability, fails 
to absorb or desorb oxygen sufficiently at a temperature of 
400-700°C and brings about a drawback such that it is reduced in 
specific surface area after heating at a higher temperature and 
is thus lowered in performance. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a novel compound oxide possessing especially excellent 
oxygen absorbing and desorbing capability and durability at a 
high temperature as well as a method for preparing same. It is another object of the present invention to provide a 
method for easily preparing the compound oxide possessing 
especially excellent oxygen absorbing and desorbing capability 
and durability at a high temperature in good reproducible 
manner. The above and other objects of the present invention will 
become apparent more fully from the following description. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a compound oxide having oxygen absorbing and desorbing 
capability, which comprises 4.99-98.99% by weight of cerium 
oxide, 1-95% by weight of zirconium oxide and 0.01-20% by weight 
of hafnium oxide and has an oxygen absorbing and desorbing 
capability of at least 100 µmol/g at 400-700°C and a specific 
surface area of at least 10 m²/g after being heated
