<DESCRIPTION>
One approach to controlling the spread of viral disease is
to administer modified live viruses as vaccines. However,
such vaccines may not be 100% effective. Addition of an
adjuvant to a vaccine will enhance the immunogenicity of the
vaccine and thereby increase its protective capacity.Marek's disease is of serious concern in the poultry
industry. Infection with Marek's Disease Virus can cause a
fatal lymphoproliferative disorder and result in significant
losses in major production parameters including, but not
limited to, condemnations due to leukosis. Other indices of
production including mortality, feed conversion and total
cost per chick can also be affected by severe outbreaks of
the disease. Control of the disease has been attempted
using modified live virus vaccine, primarily a modified live
Herpesvirus of Turkeys (Marek's Disease Virus serotype III)
vaccine.. Although vaccination with Herpesvirus of turkeys
(HVT) is considered highly effective in preventing Marek's
Disease, some loss continues to occur in low level
condemnations due to field challenge, immunosuppression and
overt disease due to very virulent Marek's Disease challenge
(vvMD). Control of very virulent Marek's Disease has been
attempted with bivalent Marek's Disease virus serotype II
and III vaccines. However, use of these vaccines is
associated with an increase in lymphoid leukosis in certain
breeds of birds (Bacon et al., 1989).Adjuvant-containing vaccine with improved protective
capacity would help to eliminate the losses that continue to 
occur despite the use of presently existing Marek's Disease
vaccines and would therefore be of great value in the
poultry industry.The leaf of the Aloebarbadensis plant (Aloe vera) contains
large amounts of a β-(1,4) linked acetylated mannan known as
acemannan, a water-soluble polymer of about one million kDa.
Preparation of acemannan is disclosed by U.S. Patent Nos.
4,735,935 (April 5, 1988), 4,851,224 (July 25, 1989),
4,917,890 (April 17, 1990), 4,957,907 (September 18, 1990),
4,959,214 (September 25, 1990) and 4,966,892 (October 30,
1990). Use of acemannan as an adjuvant to improve the
protective capacity of a vaccine has not previously been
described.The present invention provides a Herpesvirus of Turkeys
vaccine containing an acemannan adjuvant, a modified live
virus vaccine containing an acemannan adjuvant and a
modified live virus vaccine containing a complex
carbohydrate adjuvant. This invention provides a Herpesvirus of Turkeys vaccine
which comprises per dose an effective immunizing
