<ABSTRACT>
A keyboard assembly (1) for transmitting data to a central processing unit (8) remote from the keyboard assembly comprises a plurality of keys (4) for accepting numeric input data and command input data from a user; numeric processing means for locally processing the numeric input data in dependence on the command input data to produce numeric output data; display means (2) for displaying the numeric input data and the output data; interface means for transmitting the output data as keyboard data to the remote central processing unit; and mode selection means (16) for allowing a user to select between a first mode of operation of the keyboard assembly in which output is disabled from being transmitted to the remote central processing unit, a second mode in which the numeric processing means produces numeric output data whose numeric value is the same as the value of the numeric input data, and a third mode in which in response to a transmit signal supplied to the numeric processing means as command input data the numeric value displayed by the display means is transmitted to the remote central processing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a keyboard assembly. It is often necessary to input numbers when using a 
computer. Therefore, for convenience, the main keyboards 
of many computers include numeric keypads, in which 
numeric keys are grouped together. However, numbers 
which are to be entered are often the results of 
calculations and it is inconvenient for users to have to 
copy such results from, say, a calculator into the 
computer - even using a numeric keypad. Also, copying 
such results is a potential source of error. Due to considerations of compactness the main keyboards 
of lap-top and notebook computers often incorporate 
"embedded" numeric keypads, in which a group of 
alphabetic keys can be given the effect of a numeric 
keypad when a control key is pressed. Such embedded 
keypads are inconvenient in use and, since their keys 
have two functions which must be displayed on their key 
caps, their key caps are difficult to read. UK Patent Application 2249200A describes a keyboard 
assembly for connection by wire in series between a host 
computer and the host computer's main keyboard. One or 
other of the keyboard assembly and the main keyboard is 
operable at anyone time to allow numeric data to be input 
to the central processing unit of the host computer. The 
keyboard assembly and the main keyboard cannot be 
operated at the same time; and the keyboard assembly 
cannot operate as a numeric keypad, wherein each keypress 
on the keyboard assembly is transmitted as keyboard input 
to the host computer. According to the present invention there is provided a 
keyboard assembly for transmitting data to a central 
processing unit remote from the keyboard assembly, the  
 
keyboard assembly comprising: a plurality of keys for 
accepting numeric input data and command input data from 
a user; numeric processing means for locally processing 
the numeric input data in dependence on the command input 
data to produce numeric output data; display means for 
displaying the numeric input data and the output data; 
interface means for transmitting the output data as 
keyboard data to the remote central processing unit; and 
mode selection means for allowing a user to select 
between a first mode of operation of the keyboard 
assembly in which output is disabled from being 
transmitted to the remote central processing unit, a 
second mode of operation in which the numeric processing 
means produces numeric output data whose numeric value is 
the same as the value of the numeric input data, and a 
third
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A keyboard assembly (1) for transmitting data to a 
central processing unit (8) remote from the keyboard 

assembly, the keyboard assembly comprising: 

a plurality of keys (3,4,5) for accepting numeric input data 
and command input data from a user; 
numeric processing mean (9) for locally processing the 
numeric input data in dependence on the command input 

data to produce numeric output data; 
display means (2) for displaying the numeric input data 
and the output data; 
interface means (12) for transmitting the output data as 
keyboard data to the remote central processing unit; and 
mode selection means (6,16) for allowing a user to select 
between a first mode of operation of the keyboard 

assembly in which output is disabled from being 
transmitted to the remote central processing unit, a 

second mode of operation in which the numeric processing 
means produces numeric output data whose numeric value is 

the same as the value of the numeric input data, and a 
third mode of operation in which in response to a 

transmit signal supplied as command input data to the 
numeric processing means the numeric value displayed by 

the display means is transmitted to the remote central 
processing unit. 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the interface means is such as to allow a main keyboard (14) 

to transmit keyboard data to the central processing unit 
during operation of the keyboard assembly. 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the keyboard assembly and the main keyboard are connected 

to the central processing unit in parallel. 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the keyboard assembly is connected to the 

central processing unit via a wireless link.  
 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the wireless link is an optical link. 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in claim 5, wherein 
the wireless link is an infrared link. 
A keyboard assembly as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the wireless link is a radio link.
