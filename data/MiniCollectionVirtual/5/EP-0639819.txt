A method and an apparatus are disclosed for controlling the 
amount of irradiation effectively emitted by a source of penetrating 

radiation in a system wherein radiation emitted by said source and 
attenuated by an object is stored in a photostimulable phosphor 

screen. An indication of the effectively emitted radiation amount 
is obtained by means of a difference of a specific signal value and

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of digital radiography. The 
invention more specifically relates to a method of controlling the 
amount of radiation to which an object was exposed at the time of 
recording a radiation image of said object. It is well-known that in case a patient is irradiated by means 
of penetrating radiation such as x-rays it is most important that 
the radiation dose to which the patient is exposed is accurately 
controlled so as to avoid excess exposure which is harmful for the 
patient. It is thus extremely important that fluctuations of the emission 
of a radiation source or deviations of the effectively emitted 
amount of irradiation from the set amount of irradiation are 
accurately monitored and adjusted when necessary. In classical radiography wherein a radiation image is recorded 
onto a radiographic film, a relation has been established which 
defines for each specific radiographic film the optimal radiation 
dose to be applied in order to achieve that the diagnostically 
relevant part of an image is reproduced on the radiographic film at 
an optimal image density. Different types of radiographic films have been developed that 
each provide this optimal reproduction at different irradiation 
doses. Each of these different types of films is particularly 
suitable for a specific examination or group of examinations. The radiation dose suitable for application with a specific 
radiographic film is defined by a value S which is a characteristic 
of a given radiographic film called the "speed class" of the film. 
For each radiographic film the optimal irradiation dose can be 
deduced from the speed class value by applying the formula given 
hereinbelow. When setting the radiation dose at the deduced value, the 
diagnostically relevant part of an image will be recorded on a 
selected film at an optical density which is approximately 1.0 above  
 
fog and base density. This speed class value S is defined as follows: 
S = 10-3 GyKS 
wherein Ks represents the exposure dose required to produce on said 
film an optical density of 1.00 above fog and base density , said 
value Ks being expressed in Gy. For example, when using a class 100 film for recording a 
radiation image, the x-ray dose must be adjusted so that the average 
dose at the detector (so at the radiographic film) is about 10-5 Gy 
in the regions of diagnostical interest which corresponds to an 
exposure dose of 1.14 mR; when using a film of speed class 200 the 
dose can be halved etc. Thus, when in classical radiography the
