<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to ultrasonic
intravascular imaging devices -- i.e., devices of
the type which utilize acoustic transducers
operating at ultrasonic frequencies to image
intravascular geometry and/or associated tissue
characteristics. In a specific embodiment it
includes an elongate probe guide assembly, an
ultrasonic transducer fixed to the probe guide
assembly's distal end, and electrical cabling housed
within, and extending proximally of, the probe guide
assembly so as to send/receive electrical signals
to/from the transducer.This invention,
in preferred embodiments,
effectively reduces "dead space"
radially of the probe otherwise obscuring nearby
reflections during the normal "ring down" time of a
piezoelectric transceiver/transducer immediately
after a transmit operation. A reflector is distally
spaced from the transducer so as to reflect the
ultrasound waves between a first path which is
substantially parallel to the probe axis and a
second path which is substantially perpendicular
(i.e., radial) to the probe axis. According to the invention a tuning
induction coil is electrically connected in series
with the transducer and is coaxially positioned
within the tube section closely adjacent to the
transducer as defined in claim 1. Such structure permits the ultrasound
probes of this invention to be sufficiently 
miniaturized to be useful in extremely near-field
intravascular imaging procedures.Intravascular probes which include ultrasound
imaging crystal arrays have been proposed in the
past. It is known, for example, to mount a
piezoelectric crystal element (conventionally termed
a "transducer") on or within a catheter of the type
which can be inserted into a blood vessel. Once the
probe has been inserted into a blood vessel, the
transducer is electro-mechanically excited (as by
the application of an electrical signal) to cause
emission of ultrasonic energy into the surrounding
tissue. While much of the emitted energy is
absorbed by the surrounding tissue, a sufficient
amount of energy is reflected back toward the
transducer to permit imaging (with reflection
occurring principally at interfaces between
different types of material, e.g., the interface
between blood and the vascular wall, the interface
between blood and lesions adhered to the vascular
wall, etcetera).The transducer, in turn, produces weak
electrical signals in response to electro mechanical
excitation by the returning reflected ("echo")
ultrasonic energy. These weak electrical signals
can be used to determine the
