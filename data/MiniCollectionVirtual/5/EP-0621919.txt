<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a down-the-hole rock drill 
including a top sub, a driver sub, a piston case extending 
between and detachably connected to said top sub and said 
driver sub, a piston located within said piston case, a 
drill bit detachably connected to said driver sub, said 
drill bit including a shank and a head, the drill bit 
having a central bit passageway for flushing medium and a 
number of branch passageways for flushing medium, said 
branch passageways extending from the central bit 
passageway to the front of the head, a tube means being 
secured in the central bit passageway, said tube means 
extending beyond the upper end of the drill bit, the piston 
having a central piston passageway that receives said tube 
means, said piston being slidably movable relative to said 
tube means. The most common way by far to provide rotational driving 
between the shaft of the drill bit and the driver sub is to 
use splines both on the exterior of the shaft and on the 
wall of the bore of the driver sub. However, such a design 
of the cooperating rotational driving means of the shaft of 
the drill bit and the bore of the driver sub is complicated 
to manufacture and consequently the manufacturing is time 
consuming and expensive. According to GB-B-1 242 052 the 
conventional splines design suffers from the disadvantage 
that the splines of the chuck (driver sub) and the drill bit 
are caused to wear very rapidly by the repeated relative 
axial and angular movements between them. From GB-B-1 242 052 a percussive rock drilling apparatus of 
the type defined above in the first paragraph is previously 
known. The aim of the design of the rotational driving 
means between the driver sub and the shaft of the drill bit 
as disclosed in GB-B-1 242 052 is to avoid said 
disadvantages concerning rapid wear and angular movements.  
 The known device according to GB-B-1 242 052 has a 
transverse pin secured in the driver sub (chuck) of the 
device, said pin cooperating with an axially extending flat 
surface on the shaft of the drill bit to restrict the axial 
displacement of the drill bit. However, such a structural 
design of the means for restriction of axial displacement of 
the drill bit relative to the driver sub will negatively 
affect the longitudinal centering of the shaft, during 
working conditions, relative to the bore of the driver sub. 
This is an extremely important feature for drill bits having 
an internal bore extending axially through the drill bit, 
i.e. drill bits of the type used
