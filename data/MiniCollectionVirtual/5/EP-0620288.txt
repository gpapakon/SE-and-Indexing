<ABSTRACT>
A cold-rolled sheet or a hot-galvanized, cold-rolled sheet having high paint bake hardening and cold nonaging properties 
and being excellent in the forming properties such as an average r value (deep drawing characteristics) and elongation (bulging 

characteristics) is produced by annealing an ultralow-carbon steel itself or one containing at least either titanium or niobium 
above the Ac₃ transformation point to thereby give thereto a single-phase structure of low-temperature transformation product. 

As regards the paint bake hardening properties, it is possible to realize a BH value as high as about 10 kgf/mm².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cold-rolled steel
sheet and a hot-dip galvanized cold-rolled steel sheet
having excellent bake hardenability, non-aging properties
at room temperature and good formability and a process
for producing the same.The cold-rolled steel sheet according to the present
invention is subjected to press molding before use in
automobiles, domestic electric appliances, buildings,
etc. It includes both a cold-rolled steel sheet in a
narrow sense, which has an untreated surface, and a cold-rolled
steel sheet subjected to surface treatments, such
as galvanizing or alloyed galvanizing, for rust
preventive purposes. Since the steel sheet according to
the present invention has a combination of strength with
formability, use thereof enables the sheet thickness to
be reduced to a greater extent than with conventional
steel sheets. In other words, a reduction in weight is
possible. Therefore, the steel sheet of the present
invention can be expected to contribute to the protection
of the environment.The production of an extra low carbon steel by a
melt process has now become easy by virtue of advances in
a vacuum degassing process for molten steels in recent
years. This has led to an ever-increasing demand for
extra low carbon steel sheets having a good formability.
Among them, extra low carbon steel sheets disclosed in,
for example, 
JP-A 59-31827 and JP-A-59-38337, wherein Ti and Nb are
added in combination, have a combination of very good
formability and paint-bake hardenability (BH) and are
also excellent in hot-dip galvanizing properties, so that
they hold an important position in this field. The BH
level of these sheets, however, does not exceed the level
of the conventional BH steel sheets, and an attempt to
further enhance the BH level unfavorably makes it
impossible to ensure that non-aging properties at room
temperature. Further, numerous extra low carbon steel
sheets containing neither Ti or Nb and having an
excellent formability have been disclosed, and examples
thereof include those disclose in
JP-B-53-22052 and
JP-A-58-136721 and
JP-A-58-141335.Meanwhile, many attempts to enhance the strength of
steel sheets while ensuring the formability thereof have
hitherto been made in the art. In particular, in the
case of steel sheets having a tensile strength in the
range of from 30 to 50 kgf/mm2, which are similar to
those of the present invention, P. Si, etc. have been
added to the steels to increase the strength through the
utilization of solid solution strengthening by P and Si.
