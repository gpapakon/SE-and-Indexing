<ABSTRACT>
Multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis represent a considerable threat to public health worldwide. Resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin or analogues thereof, or streptomycin, i.e. key components of anti-tuberculosis regimens, need frequently to be detected. The invention involves the detection of a mutation in either the katG gene (isoniazid resistance), the rpoB gene (rifampicin resistance) or rpsL gene (streptomycin resistance).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the rapid detection of
strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant
to antibiotics, particularly isoniazid, rifampicin and
streptomycin. More particularly, this invention relates
to a method of detecting antibiotic resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, e.g. either as a result of
mutations in the relevant genes or by nucleic acid
hybridization. This invention also relates to a nucleic
acid probe and a kit for carrying out the nucleic acid
hybridization. The invention further relates to the
chromosomal location of the katG gene and its nucleotide
sequence.Despite more than a century of research since the
discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the aetiological
agent of tuberculosis, by Robert Koch, this disease
remains one of the major causes of human morbidity and
mortality. There are an estimated 3 million deaths
annually attributable to tuberculosis (Snider, 1989), and
although the majority of these are in developing countries,
the disease is assuming renewed importance in the
West due to the increasing number of homeless people and
the impact of the AIDS epidemic (Chaisson et al., 1987;
Snider and Roper, 1992).Isonicotinic acid hydrazide or isoniazid (INH) has been
used in the treatment of tuberculosis for the last forty
years due to its exquisite potency against the members of
the "tuberculosis" groups - Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
M. bovis and M. africanum (Middlebrook, 1952; Youatt,
1969). Neither the precise target of the drug, nor its 
mode of action, are known, and INH treatment results in
the perturbation of several metabolic pathways. There is
substantial evidence indicating that INH may act as an
antimetabolite of NAD and pyridoxal phosphate
(Bekierkunst and Bricker, 1967; Sriprakash and
Ramakrishnan, 1970; Winder and Collins, 1968, 1969,
1970), and other data indicating that the drug blocks the
synthesis of the mycolic acids, which are responsible for
the acid-fast character of mycobacterial cell walls
(Winder and Collins 1970; Quemard et al., 1991). Shortly
after its introduction, INH-resistant isolates of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis emerged and, on
characterization, were often found to have lost
catalase-peroxidase activity and to show reduced
virulence in guinea pigs (Middlebrook et al., 1954;
Kubica et al., 1968; Sriprakash and Ramakrishnan, 1970).Very recently, INH-resistance has acquired new
significance owing to a tuberculosis epidemic in the USA
due to multidrug resistant (MDR) variants of M.
tuberculosis (CDC, 1990; 1991a, b) and the
