<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an aqueous correction fluid which prevents bleeding 
of aqueous ink dyes during correction of writing errors. The correction fluid 

contains an acid-functional polymer modified with an amino functional silane. The 
aminosilane-modified correction fluid may be substituted for solvent-based fluids, 

without adversely affecting other properties such as water resistance, opacity and 
curing.

<DESCRIPTION>
Correction fluids used for whiting out writing errors are known. They are 
typically applied, for example, by means of a brush which is attached to the screw 
cap of the container. In addition to having pigments and fillers such as clay, the 
correction fluid also contains a polymeric binder and dispersant to anchor the 
pigments to the paper, as well as a dispersant medium or solvent to maintain the 
viscosity of the correction fluid. The solvents are generally volatile organic solvents 
such as hydrocarbons or chlorinated products of hydrocarbons. Correction fluids suffer at least two shortcomings: they are environmentally 
unfriendly, and they allow aqueous ink dyes to bleed through, or in to, the applied 
correction fluid. Bleeding means that the white correction layer assumes a bluish or 
reddish tint or other type of blemish colour due to the ink dye penetrating the 
surface being corrected. While aqueous based correction fluids minimize the 
environmental concerns, they have not found wide acceptance as substitutes for 
solvent-based correction fluid. Water-soluble ink dyes present in fiber markers and 
felt tip pens dissolve in aqueous correction fluid and penetrate and bleed into the 
surface at the point where the correction fluid is applied. Although other systems for preventing bleeding of correction fluids used to 
white out writing errors are known, none use or suggest the use of an aminosilane-modified 
polymer as an effective blocking agent. For example, German Pat. No. W0 
92/ 07039 discloses a correction fluid capable of preventing bleeding which contains 
water or a mixture of water and volatile organic water-miscible solvents as 
suspension medium, a cationically active film-forming binder to fix the dyes in the 
area to be corrected. US-A-5,051,283 discloses a surface treating composition for wooden surfaces 
which inhibits leachable compositions from staining after-applied water-base coating 
comprising about 1 (one) to about 25 percent by weight of an alkali metal salt of a 
monobasic or dibasic carboxylic acid and about 1 (one) to about 50 percent by weight 
of a water-soluble organic compound bearing one or more salt-forming amine 
groups and having a molecular weight of about 50 to about 300,000 and from about 
25 percent to about 98 percent water. International Application Number PCT/US/00643 discloses a polymeric 
composition containing at least one acid-functional vinyl polymer and at least one 
amino-functional siloxane polymer. The blended polymeric compositions are able
