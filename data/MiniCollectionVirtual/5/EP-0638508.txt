<ABSTRACT>
Electronic push-button element as call and signal transmitter in elevator controls for fitting with rear fastening in operating panels at floors (storeys) and in elevator cars, comprising push-button guide, support plate, optical acknowledgement and electronic part. The mechanical part of the push-button element has a plunger element (1) which is movable to a limited extent in a guide of a luminous ring plate (5) and pressure-relieves a pressure-sensitive resistor FSR (3) by means of an elastic pressure cap (2) when the push-button element is actuated. The change in resistance of the FSR (3) effected under mechanical pressure results in a displacement of potential inside a voltage divider, whereby a switching transistor is put into the conductive state via a preamplifier/trigger, and the switching transistor, in turn, switches on a corresponding load. With separation of potential, an acknowledging circuit is closed by the load via a contact. The basic mechanical construction permits different variants with regard to design and function.

Electronic pushbutton element as call and signal transmitter in lift controls for
installation with rear-side fastening in control panels at storeys and in lift cages, consisting

of pushbutton guide (5), carrier plate, optical acknowledgement and electronic part (8),
characterised in that the pushbutton element comprises a plunger element (1) which s

capable of limited movement in a guide, is provided with a resilient pressure cap (2),
exerts on actuation a pressure force not exceeding an acceptable maximum value on a

pressure-sensitive element (3) and is able to be combined with different press discs (12,
13, 14).
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that the
surface of the pressure cap (2) which on actuation contacts the pressure-sensitive element

has on non-actuation of the pushbutton and by means of a compression spring (4) in the
plunger element (1) a position which does not contact the pressure-sensitive element and

is spaced therefrom.
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that the
pushbutton has a legend possibility insertable between press disc (12, 13, 14) and plunger

element (1).
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that a force-sensitive
resistor (3) is present as the pressure-sensitive element.
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that a strain-measuring
strip is present as the pressure-sensitive element.
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that a
microswitch is present as the pressure-sensitive element.
Electronic pushbutton element according to claim 1, characterised in that a
rotational securing by means of at least one groove (28) in the plunger element (1) and at

least one dog (27), which engages in the groove (28), in the illuminating ring plate (5) is
present. 
Electronic pushbutton element according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that as securing against rotation a pin (24) is present in the illuminating

ring plate (5) and a bore (25), which receives the pin (24), is present in the reflector plate

(6).
Electronic pushbutton element according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that an illuminating ring plate (5) has a construction serving the plunger

element (1) as guide.
Electronic pushbutton element according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the illuminating ring plate (5) and the reflector plate (6) have a

construction making a limited travel possible for the plunger element (1).
