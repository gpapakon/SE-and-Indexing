<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is an insulative structure for cables, comprising at least one first semiconducting layer that is contiguous and coaxial with the core of the cable and is surrounded by a second electrically insulating layer which is itself covered by a third semiconducting layer, characterised in that the said semiconducting layers are exclusively composed of a matrix, comprising non-polar polymers whose components have a molecular weight (molar mass) greater than 1000, and of a conductive filler.

<CLAIMS>
Cable insulation structure including at least a semiconductor first layer
contiguous and coaxial with the cable core surrounded by an electrically

insulating second layer covered with a semiconductor third layer, 
characterised
in that
 said semiconductor layers comprise exclusively a matrix including only
apolar polymers whose components have a molecular weight greater than

1 000 and a conductive charge.
Structure according to claim 1 wherein the components of said matrix have a
molecular weight greater than 5 000.
Structure according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said matrix is selected from
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and their copolymers, alloys of

polymers chosen from polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and their
copolymers, and mixtures of the aforementioned substanc
es.
Structure according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said matrix is chosen from
polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers and mixtures thereof.
Structure according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said charge is
acetylene black.
