<ABSTRACT>
Yarns are prepared by spinning PEN or other semi-crystalline polyester polymers made from similarly rigid monomer combinations to a state of optimum amorphous orientation and crystallinity. This is accomplished by selection of process parameters to form an undrawn polyester yarn of birefringence at least 0.030. The spun yarn is then hot drawn to a total draw ratio of between 1.5/1 and 6.0/1 with the resulting drawn semi-crystalline polyester yarn having Tg greater than 100  DEG C and a melting point elevation at least 8  DEG C. The preferred yarn has a tenacity at least 6.5 g/d, dimensional stability (EASL + Shrinkage) of less than 5 %, and shrinkage 4 % or less. The resulting yarn exhibits surprisingly high modulus and tenacity together with low shrinkage when compared to prior art yarns.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) multifilament yarn and other yarns made from similarly
rigid monomer combinations with extremely high modulus, good tenacity, and low shrinkage particularly useful for the
textile reinforcement of tires. The PEN yarn of this invention provides enhanced modulus and dimensional stability
when compared to conventionally processed PEN yarns. A process for production of the multi-filament PEN yarn is
an aspect of this invention.Currently, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) filaments are commonly used in industrial applications including radial
tire bodies, conveyor belts, seat belts, V belts and hosing. However, higher modulus and dimensional stability is preferred
in more demanding applications such as bodied of monoply high performance tires and is required in the belts
of radial passenger tires. Dimensional stability is defined as the sum of the elongation at 4.5 g/d (39.7 mN/dtex) and
shrinkage. US-A-3 616 832 provides rubber articles reinforced with PEN of good dimensional stability and tenacity and
US-A-3 929 180 provides a tire with PEN used as a carcass reinforcement. However, these patents are concerned
with conventionally processed PEN of low undrawn birefringence and hence do not achieve the full property potential
of this material as is the object of this invention. The same is true of GB-A-1 445 464 which teaches optimized drawing
of conventionally spun PEN. US-A-4 000 239 provides a process for producing a high melting point, heat resistant
undrawn PEN for electrically insulating fabrics. Since these materials were prepared under high stress conditions
favoring high crystallinity or at least highly nucleated structure, they lack drawability and cannot attain high modulus
for the applications contemplated herein. A product for the same application is provided in US-A-4 001 479, which is
concerned with partially oriented yarns of high elongation and low tenacity.The process of the invention is defined in claim 1. The drawn yarn of the invention is defined in claim 6. The yarns of this invention are prepared by spinning PEN or other semi-crystalline polyester polymers made from
similarly rigid monomer combinations to a state of optimum amorphous orientation and crystallinity. The invention is
accomplished by selection of process parameters to form an undrawn polyester yarn of birefringence at least 0.030.
The spun yarn is then hot drawn to a total draw ratio of between 1.5/1 and 6.0/1 with the resulting drawn semicrystalline
polyester yarn

<CLAIMS>
A process for production of a drawn polyester yarn of enhanced modulus and good tenacity, comprising:

(a) extruding a molten crystallizable polyester polymer having Tg greater than 100°C and having an intrinsic
viscosity of 0.6 or greater through a shaped extrusion orifice having a plurality of openings to form a molten

spun yarn,
(b) solidifying the spun yarn by passing through a solidification zone,
(c) withdrawing the solidified yarn at a sufficient undrawn take-up speed to form a partially oriented yarn of
birefringence of 0.030 to 0.30 and melting point elevation of 1-25°C, and
(d) hot drawing the yarn to a total draw ratio of at least 1.5/1 to form a drawn yarn having L
T
 at least 25.
The process of Claim 1 wherein the spun yarn is solidified by passing through a solidification zone which comprises
(a) a retarded cooling zone comprising a gaseous atmosphere heated at a temperature of at least 150°C, and (b)

a cooling zone adjacent to said retarded cooling zone wherein said yarn is rapidly cooled and solidified in a blown
air atmosphere.
The process of Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the undrawn take-up speed is 400 to 4500 m/min.
The process of Claims 1 or 2 for production of a drawn polyethylene naphthalate yarn wherein the molten polyester
polymer extruded in step (a) is polyethylene naphthalate.
The process of claim 4 wherein the undrawn take-up speed is 400 to 4500 m/min.,
and the melting point elevation of the partially oriented yarn is 3-23°C.
A drawn semi-crystalline polyester multifilament yarn having Tg greater than 100°C and a melting point elevation
of at least 9°C, which is obtained by drawing a polyester yarn having an undrawn birefringence of at least 0.030, and

which has L
T

shrinkage) of less than 5%, and a shrinkage of 4% or less.
The drawn yarn of claim 7 which is polyethylene naphthalate.
The drawn polyethylene naphthalate yarn of claim 8 wherein the melting point elevation is 9 to 15°C, the modulus
is at least 280 g/d (2470 mN/dtex) and the tenacity is at least 7.5 g/d (66.2 mN/dtex).
