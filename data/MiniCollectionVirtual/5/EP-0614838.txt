<ABSTRACT>
A web transporting device which can be used in a rotary printing machine or a folding apparatus comprises a rotatable, driven transporting roller (10) with a fixed axis and at least one engageable pressure roller (12) whose axis is essentially parallel to the said fixed axis and which can be engaged with the driven transporting roller (10). The engageable pressure roller (12) has a length which corresponds to a maximum width of the web to be processed in the printing machine. An exchangeable pressure sleeve (14) is provided, which is mounted axially on the engageable pressure roller (12). The exchangeable pressure sleeve (14) has at least one annular gap along its axial length, which gap allows the web to curl when passing through the web transporting device without permanent folds or creases being formed therein. A counterweight mechanism (56) is also provided, which stabilises the engageable pressure roller (12) in a maintenance position while the exchangeable pressure sleeve (14) is being exchanged.

Web transporting device having a rotatably driven 
transport roller (10) having a fixed axis and at least 

one engageable nip roller (12) whose axis extends 
essentially parallel to the fixed axis, and which is 

engageable against the driven transport roller (10), and 
has a length which corresponds to the maximum width of a 

web (16) to be processed in the printing machine, 
characterized in that a single exchangeable nip sleeve 

(14) mounted on the engageable nip roller (12) contains 
at least one annular gap (36) along its axial length in 

order to avoid the formation of folds in the web (16). 
Web transporting device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the exchangeable nip sleeve (14) 

comprises at least one layer of material. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the exchangeable nip sleeve (14) 

comprises the following features: 

a cylindrical outer layer (30) having a smooth, continuous 
outer surface which constitutes the jacket 

surface (32) of the nip sleeve (14); 
a cylindrical intermediate layer (38) which is located, 
seen in the radial direction, within the said outer layer 

(30), and the said intermediate layer (38) has a cylindrical 
outer surface (40) which is mounted fixedly on the 

cylindrical inner surface (42) of the said outer layer 
(30); 
and a cylindrical, tubular inner layer (44), a cylindrical 
inner surface (48) of the said inner layer (44) being 

in contact with a cylindrical 
outer surface (50) of the engageable nip roller (12). 
Web transporting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the cylindrical outer layer (30) of 

the exchangeable nip sleeve (14) consists of a very thin, 
incompressible material of medium hardness. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the intermediate layer (38) of the 

exchangeable nip sleeve (14) consists of an elastic, 
compressible material. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the intermediate layer (38) of the 

exchangeable nip sleeve (14) is reinforced with a cotton 
fabric. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the inner layer (44) of the 

exchangeable nip sleeve (14) consists of an elastically 
expandable rigid material. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the exchangeable nip sleeve (14) 

comprises an additional layer which consists of a very 
thin, incompressible material of medium hardness and, 

seen in the radial direction, is mounted within the 
intermediate layer (38) and outside the inner layer (44). 
Web transporting device according to Claim 1, 
which furthermore comprises a counterbalancing mechanism 

(56) with which the engageable nip roller (12) is stabilized 
when the exchangeable nip sleeve (14), during 

exchange, is taken down from or mounted onto one side of 
the said engageable nip roller (12). 
Web transporting device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the counterbalancing mechanism (56) 

comprises a link arm (60) which is attached to a 
calliper-shaped part (62) at one end and to a lifting 

part (64) at the other end, and the lifting part (64) is, 
in turn, connected to a pivoting part (66) which turns 

about a fixed point (68), and the pivoting part (66) is, 
in turn, connected to an activating apparatus (70) which 

activates the counterbalancing mechanism (56) and moves 
the pivoting part (66) into a tilted position. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 10,  
 

characterized in that the calliper-shaped part (62) is 
designed in such a way that it fits over an axle journal 

(58) of the engageable nip roller (12) and the engageable 
nip roller (12) is thus locked in its position. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the activating apparatus (70) moves 

the link arm (60) until the calliper-shaped part (62) is 
securely positioned on the axle journal (58) of the 

engageable nip roller (12). 
Web transporting device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the engageable nip roller (12) has 

at least one radially extending opening (72) through 
which a pressure medium is supplied in order to expand 

the exchangeable nip sleeve (14) elastically during 
exchange. 
Web transporting device according to Claim 13, 
characterized
 in that the engageable nip roller (12) has 
a hollow interior which is connected to a source of a 

pressure medium via a pipe (74) through which a pressure 
medium passes into the interior of the engageable nip 

roller (12) and is conducted outwardly through the 
radially extending opening (72).
