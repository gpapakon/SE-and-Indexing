<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition
having an excellent balance in various properties, and a
molded product thereof. More specifically, this invention
relates to a thermoplastic resin composition in which
mechanical strength, heat resistance, moldability, appearance
of a molded product, chemical resistance and dimensional
characteristics are excellent by making a portion in
which a non-crystalline thermoplastic resin (e.g. a non-crystalline
thermoplastic resin comprising a polyphenylene
ether (hereinafter referred to as "PPE") or PPE and an
aromatic vinyl compound polymer) takes a structure forming
a matrix and a portion in which a crystalline thermoplastic
resin (e.g. a crystalline thermoplastic resin comprising a
polyolefin type resin) takes a structure forming a matrix
coexist and, if necessary, making an inorganic filler exist
in a specific phase, and a molded product thereof.A polymer blend comprising a combination of two or more
resins has a characteristic that a well-balanced composition
can be obtained by using good properties of the
respective resins and compensating undesirable properties
thereof. Excellent effects in practical use can be 
obtained particularly by a combination of a crystalline
thermoplastic resin and a non-crystalline thermoplastic
resin so that various combinations thereof have been made.A non-crystalline thermoplastic resin is an useful resin
generally having excellent heat resistance and dimensional
stability. For example, PPE has excellent heat resistance
and impact resistance. However, PPE has extremely poor
moldability so that PPE has a drawback that it is extremely
difficult to carry out injection molding of PPE when it is
used alone. In order to remove such a drawback, materials
having a relatively good balance of moldability, impact
resistance and heat resistance have been developed by formulating
a polystyrene type resin into PPE, and the materials
are commercially available as engineering plastics.For example, there has been disclosed a composition of PPE
and a high impact polystyrene in U.S. Patent No. 3,383,435.
In this composition, although moldability is improved,
solvent resistance is poor and a balance between heat
resistance and impact resistance is insufficient. Also, a
composition in which impact resistance is improved by
formulating a polystyrene resin and rubber or a rubber-modified
polystyrene resin into PPE and making the average
particle size of the rubber 0.5 to 2 µm has been disclosed
in Japanese Provisional Patent
