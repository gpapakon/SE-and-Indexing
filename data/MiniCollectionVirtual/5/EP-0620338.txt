<ABSTRACT>
An automated parking garage has a pair of automobile 
lifting units (100, 100a) of multi-storied construction, 

each having a movable middle vehicle carrying pan (102) and 
a lower stationary vehicle carrying pan (104). The parking 

garage comprises a multistorey parking building (6) having 
a number of parking floors arranged on either side of a 

shaft in which the two lifting units (100, 100a) move. 
Power from a drive power generating unit (1) is used to 

drive the lifting units such that one lifting unit ascends 
as the other descends. Each pan (102, 104) has a pair of 

vehicle holding conveyor belts (104a), and a main drive 
shaft (201) for driving the holding conveyor belts also 

powers a pair of parking conveyor belts (104b) on a parking 
floor. A timing unit (170) controls the movement of the 

conveyor belts and causes the holding and parking conveyor 
belts (104a, 104b) to be stopped after moving a 

predetermined distance. A roll guider unit (180) is 
associated with each automobile lifting unit (100, 100a) 

for bridging the gap between a vehicle holding conveyor 
belt (104a) and a parking conveyor belt (104b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automobile lifting 
unit for a parking garage for automobiles and other 
vehicles, and to an automated multistorey parking garage 
provided with an automobile lifting unit, such as a parking 
elevator. With the growing commercialization of available land 
in urban areas, especially in city centre areas where high 
density shopping and business buildings are located, and 
the attendant increase in land costs, the use of large 
areas of such land for parking automobiles and other 
vehicles is an uneconomical operation from the standpoint 
of monetary return, and yet the aforementioned 
commercialization has created an increasing demand for 
parking space. In order to achieve the aforementioned demand, there 
has been a design of underground parking system of 
multistorey, ie., two to five floors underground. 
However, such an underground multistorey parking system has 
a problem in that considerable inconvenience together with 
uneconomical time consumption is required in parking 
operation for the automobiles. Furthermore, another 
problem of the underground parking system is resided in 
that the system is comparatively expensive. A more economically desirable result can be achieved 
through the use of multistorey parking building garage. There has been proposed a ramp type multistorey 
parking building where the driver drives the automobile to 
a desired floor by way of a ramp, and searches for an empty 
parking space in which to park the automobile. Such a ramp  
 
type parking building is generally installed with a 
passenger elevator by the use of which the driver descends 
to the ground floor of the parking building. Such a ramp 
type parking building has the disadvantage that its space 
efficiency is deteriorated as it has to be provided with 
the ramp as well as the additional passenger elevator. The above deterioration of the space efficiency of the 
ramp type parking building is somewhat overcome by an 
automated multistorey parking system where an automobile to 
be parked is automatically lifted to a desired floor while 
being loaded on automobile lifting means and automatically 
conveyed to a parking place by a parking conveyor system. However, such a known automated parking building, 
while somewhat improving the space efficiency of the 
building, nevertheless has a disadvantage in that the 
automobile lifting means lifts only one automobile at a 
time, thereby causing other automobiles to be parked to 
wait at the ground floor of the building during a

<CLAIMS>
An automobile lifting unit (100, 100a) for an 
automated parking garage, said lifting unit having a 

multistoried construction and comprising a frame supporting 
a lower stationary vehicle carrying pan (104) and a movable 

middle vehicle carrying pan (102), wherein said movable 
middle pan (102) is movable relative to said frame between 

a load position near to said lower pan (104) and a vehicle 
supporting position spaced above said lower pan, and 

further comprising a pan lifting mechanism (103) for 
selectively driving the movable middle pan (102) between 

its load and vehicle supporting positions. 
An automobile lifting unit as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein each of said movable middle pan (102) and said 

lower pan (104) has a respective pair of holding conveyor 
belts (104a) for moving vehicles, and further comprising a 

conveyor belt drive mechanism (150) supported on said lower 
pan (104) for driving said pairs of holding conveyor belts 

(104a), the power for said conveyor belt drive mechanism 
(150) being obtained from a main drive shaft (201) 

extending through said lifting unit (100, 100a). 
A lifting unit as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said 
main drive shaft (201) is connectible to a drive power 

generating unit (1) of said parking garage and extends 
substantially vertically and penetrates through said 

movable middle pan (102) and said lower pan (104), and 
wherein said pan lifting mechanism (103) for said movable 

middle pan is arranged to be powered by said main drive 
shaft (201) and is supported by said frame of said lifting 

unit (100, 100a),
