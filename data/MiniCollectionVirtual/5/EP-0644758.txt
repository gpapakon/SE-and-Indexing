<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF FATTY ACIDS, E.G. Z-HYDROXYMYSTIC ACIDS, AS ANTIVIRAL AGENTS. Field of InventionThis invention relates to the treatment of diseases caused by herpesviruses, especially by varicella zoster virus. Prior ArtViruses modify the polypeptides they synthesize in a number of ways. These modifications may result in glycoproteins or lipoproteins which have a wide variety of functions within the virus lifecycle. Lipoproteins are known to play a significant role in infection with many viruses, but their mode of action is poorly understood.Lipoproteins may arise by the post- or co-translational addition of fatty acids such as palmitic acid and myristic acid. Myristic acid is conjugated to the polypeptide by the enzyme N-myristoyl transferase. Inhibitors of this enzyme have been suggested as being of use as anti-viral agents (R.A.J. Mcllhinney, Trends in Biochemical Sciences (1990), 1_5, 387-391 and L.A. Paige et aj_. , Biochemistry (1990), 29, 10566-10573). Recently several myristic acid analogue inhibitors of N-myristoyl transferase have been shown to be effective in inhibiting the release of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from HIV infected cells (T. Saer ark et aj_., AIDS (1991), 5_, 951-958 and M.L. Bryant et al_., Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. USA (1989), 8j>, 8655-8659). The analogues shown to be effective are13-oxamyristic acid and other derivatives wherein a ethylene group between C4 and C-13 is substituted by an oxygen or sulphur atom. Although effective, the best of these derivatives has been shown to be toxic to the infected cells. In all cases described the infective virus has been a retrovirus such as HIV or Rashid sarcoma virus (RSV). A non-toxic inhibitor of myristoylation would therefore be of value. The activity in HIV is in no way indicative of activity in other viruses. Viruses are categorised into a wide range of groups and retroviruses, such as HIV, have a unique replication strategy. HIV is a particularly diverse virus 

especially in that it is an RNA virus. Thus, few generalities can be brought from data originating from HIV experiments. Summary of the InventionIt has now been found that certain other derivatives of myristic acid are effective in inhibiting herpesviruses with minimal cytotoxic effect on the infected cells. These derivatives are also of use in inhibiting retroviruses such as HIV when dissolved in an appropriate solvent. This is the first non-retroviral effect of any myristic acid analogue to be demonstrated.Accordingly the invention provides the use of a compound of
