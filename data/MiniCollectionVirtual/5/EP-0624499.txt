<ABSTRACT>
In order to load containers (1), in particular refuse containers, horizontally, two lifting devices (17) are arranged at a distance from one another on the upper bearing level (16) of a wagon frame (6) which can be moved on rails, the said lifting devices (17) being arranged so as to be capable of being positioned transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the wagon frame (6). Each of the lifting devices (17) consists of a lower base plate (18) which can be supported on the wagon frame (6) and an upper lifting plate (19) which can be moved parallel to a cylinder-piston unit (20) in the vertical direction by means of said cylinder-piston unit (20) and onto which lifting plate (19) the container (1) can be set down. By means of these lifting devices which are of flat design, form enclosed power systems and can be simply set down onto the wagon frame (6), on the one hand a container (1) which is to be loaded can be lifted to such an extent that the laterally arranged support legs (11) become free and can be folded in again in order to lower the container onto the wagon frame and, on the other hand, a container which is to be unloaded can be raised in order to fold out the support legs (11) and set down the container.

A device on a rail-mounted wagon underframe for the
horizontal loading of containers, in particular refuse

containers, with at least two lifting means (17) disposed at
a mutual distance apart on the upper receiving plane (16) of

the wagon underframe (6) transversely to the longitudinal
direction thereof, wherein each lifting means (17)

respectively comprises a lower base plate (18), which can be
supported on the wagon underframe (6), and an upper lifting

plate (19) which can be moved parallel to said base plate in
a vertical direction and on which the container (1) can be

deposited, characterised in that for the vertical movement
of each lifting plate (19) at least two piston-cylinder

units (20) are provided, which are respectively disposed in
the vicinity of the outer ends of the lifting means (17), in

that the cylinders (21) of the piston-cylinder units (20)
are respectively disposed under the base plate (18) and are

secured thereto, also their piston rods (22) penetrating the
base plate (18) in recesses are secured to the associated

lifting plate (19).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the piston-cylinder units (20) are synchronised.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that means for accommodating horizontal forces are provided

between the lifting plate (19) and the base plate (18) of
each lifting means (17).
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in that
in each case at least one projection is provided on the

underside of the lifting plate (19), which engages in a
corresponding recess in the base plate (18). 
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in that
the projection and the recess are conically shaped.
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 for the
horizontal loading of containers with a centre tunnel

extending on its underside in the longitudinal direction,
characterised in that on the upper side of the lifting plate

(19) of each lifting means (17) there is provided a means
(25) co-operating with the centre tunnel (8) for centering

the container (1) with respect to the longitudinal axis of
the wagon underframe (6).
A device according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the centering means (25) respectively has two piston-cylinder

units (27) arranged parallel to one another and
side by side in a plane parallel to the lifting plate (19)

transversely to the longitudinal axis of the wagon
underframe (6), and with an oppositely extending direction

of action, wherein the maximum projection (b) of the piston-cylinder
units (27) in the retracted position is less than

the unobstructed width (B) of the centre tunnel (8).
