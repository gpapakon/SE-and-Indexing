<ABSTRACT>
Modern illumination systems are equipped with photosensors. The photosensors which are normally used do not, however, detect the illuminance (intensity of illumination, lighting level) (E0) which can be measured on an area (34) to be illuminated, but the luminous flux (light flux) reflected from this area. The novel method and the circuit arrangement for carrying it out are intended to effect an automatic matching of the measured values to the actual control variable, the illuminance (E0). In the novel method, the measured value which is transmitted by a sensor module (4) via an application circuit (5) to a bus coupling (2) is amplified to the actual value by a gain control which acts as actuator of a closed-loop control circuit. For gain control, a resistor network (9) is connected via analog switches (24) to the feedback (8) of an operational amplifier (7) of the bus coupling (2) depending on a value which is digitally transmitted by the bus coupling (2). The method and the arrangement to carry it out are particularly suitable for illumination control in conjunction with house installation systems which can be bused.
