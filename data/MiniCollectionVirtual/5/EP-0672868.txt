<ABSTRACT>
Sleeves (28) are circumferentially spaced from one another 
about the liner of a combustor body (12) of a dry low NO
x
 combustor. 
The sleeves carry dilution air into the dilution zone. Cooling air is 

supplied a venturi (20) to cool the venturi and the cooling air flows 
into the reaction volume. The dilution air sleeves penetrate 

sufficiently to thoroughly mix the dilution air with the core of hot 
gases of combustion and, by vorticity effects caused by the flow past 

the sleeves, thoroughly mix the generally annular flow of cooling air 
from the venturi with the hot gases of combustion. The thorough 

mixing of both the cooling air and dilution air inhibits or minimizes the 
formation of cold areas or streaks within the reaction volume such 

that CO to CO₂ reactions are not quenched, affording reduced CO 
emissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to combustors for turbines and
particularly to apparatus and methods for reducing air pollutants such
as NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons from the combustion process.In one type of dry low NOx combustor for a gas turbine, there is
provided a combustor body including a plurality of primary fuel
nozzles arranged about a central secondary fuel nozzle at one end of
the combustor body, a venturi downstream from the nozzles, a
combustion liner defining a reaction volume, a dilution plane for
admitting dilution air, and a cooling air flow arranged about the
venturi walls to cool the venturi, the cooling air flowing into the
reaction volume of the combustor downstream of the venturi. Also,
dilution holes are often formed in the liner of the combustor in a
dilution zone for purposes of shaping the gas temperature profile
exiting the combustion system and providing a region for CO burnout.
In the reaction volume of the combustor, carbon monoxide (CO), an
undesirable pollutant and emission from a gas turbine combustion 
system, reacts at high temperature with air In the system to form carbon dioxide
(CO2) For example, CO will react to CO2 at a temperature above approximately
980°C (1800°F) but generally not below that temperature. Typically, the hot gases of
combustion flow axially in the combustor in a core flow which obtains a temperature
of about 1315°C (2400°F). Thus, the reaction Of CO to CO2 occurs in the core flow
as a natural result of its elevated temperature.Compressor discharge air is typically used as a source of cooling air for the
combustor, as well as for the dilution air flow, and has a combustor inlet temperature
of approximately 316°C - 371 °C (600-700°F). The cooling air for cooling the walls of
the venturi about the flame holder conventionally flows into the combustion finer in the
form of an annular flow. Consequently, there is an annular region of relatively cooler
air flow about the centrally located core flow of the hot gases of combustion as the
gases flow toward the first-stage nozzle. Moreover, while cooling air inlet admitted
through dilution holes or openings in the combustor liner beneficially reduces the exit
temperature of the combustor, it typically remains in cooler regions of the flow without
completely mixing with the higher temperature gases of the flow. As a consequence,
there are regions or streaks in the reaction volume where the cooling and/or dilution
air forms a flow region having insufficient temperature to enable the carbon monoxide
to react with
