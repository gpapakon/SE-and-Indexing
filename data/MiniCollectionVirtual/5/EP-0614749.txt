<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process and a device for cooling the internal surface of the wall of a plastic pipe (5) while it is being manufactured by extrusion. The coolant is dispersed on the internal surface of the wall by successively spraying at given time intervals. Advantageously, the coolant is dispersed by means of a system which moves inside the pipe in a reciprocating movement. The injector (23) may advantageously be equipped with means giving a rotary cone of dispersed droplets.

Process for cooling a plastic pipe during its 
manufacture by extrusion with the aid of a refrigerant 

which acts at least partially on the internal surface of 
the wall (5) of the pipe, characterized in that the 

refrigerant is dispersed in several successive repeats at 
given time intervals. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the refrigerant is water. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the refrigerant is dispersed by means of a nozzle or 

injector. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a refrigerant is sprayed onto the internal surface 

of the wall of a pipe and, as soon as this refrigerant 
has at least partially evaporated, refrigerant is sprayed 

once again onto the said surface, and so on. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the refrigerant is dispersed by means of a system 

which moves inside the pipe with an axial to-and-fro 
motion. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the refrigerant is dispersed by means of an injector 

giving a rotating cone of dispersed droplets. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pipe is cooled at the same time using a refrigerant 

which acts on the external surface of the pipe. 
Apparatus for cooling a plastic pipe during its 
manufacture by extrusion with the aid of a refrigerant 

which is dispersed on the internal surface of its wall  
 

(5) by means of an injector (23), characterized in that 
the injector is mounted on a tube (4) which moves axially 

inside the pipe (5) with a to-and-fro motion. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the injector (23) is equipped with means giving a 

rotating cone (24) of dispersed droplets. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the to-and-fro motion is produced by means of a 

piston (8) which moves in a cylinder (10), and is active 
in both directions, and which is fastened to a pinion 

(12) which runs between a fixed rack (13) and a rack 
(14), driven by the pinion, fastened to the tube (4) 

bearing the injector (23). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the speed of travel of the tube (4) can be adjusted. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the dispersion of the refrigerant takes place 

substantially during the phases when the tube (4) is 
advancing in the pipe (5) and in that the phases when 

this tube is being drawn back take place rapidly.
