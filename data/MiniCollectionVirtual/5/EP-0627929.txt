<DESCRIPTION>
In one aspect, the present invention relates
compounds which are potent inhibitors of thrombin or
factor Xa. In another aspect, the present invention
relates to novel peptide aldehyde analogs, their
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutically
acceptable compositions thereof which are useful as potent
and specific inhibitors of blood coagulation in mammals.
In yet another aspect, the invention relates to methods of
using these inhibitors as therapeutic agents for disease
states in mammals characterized by abnormal thrombosis.Normal hemostasis is the result of a complex balance
between the processes of clot formation (blood
coagulation) and clot dissolution (fibrinolysis). The
complex interactions between blood cells, specific plasma
proteins and the vascular surface, maintain the fluidity
of blood unless injury and blood loss occur.Blood coagulation is the culmination of a series of
amplified reactions in which several specific zymogens of
serine proteases in plasma are activated by limited
proteolysis. Nemerson, Y. and Nossel, H.L., Ann. Rev.
Med., 33: 479 (1982). This series of reactions results in
the formation of an insoluble fibrin matrix which is
required for the stabilization of the primary hemostatic
plug. The interaction and propagation of the activation 
reactions occurs through the extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways of coagulation. These pathways are highly interdependent
and converge in the formation of the serine
protease, Factor Xa. Factor Xa catalyzes the penultimate
step in the blood coagulation cascade which is the
formation of the serine protease thrombin. This step
occurs following the assembly of the prothrombinase
complex which is composed of factor Xa, the non-enzymatic
co-factor Va and the substrate prothrombin assembled on
the surface of adhered, activated platelets or
systemically circulating membranous microparticles.Proteolytic activation of zymogen factor X to its
catalytically active form, factor Xa, can occur by either
the intrinsic or extrinsic coagulation pathways. The
intrinsic pathway is referred to as "intrinsic" because
everything needed for clotting is in the blood. Saito, H.,
"Normal Hemostatic Mechanisms", Disorders of Hemostasis,
pp. 27-29, Grune & Stratton, Inc. (O. D. Ratnoff, M.D. and
C. D. Forbes, M.D. edit. 1984). This pathway is comprised
of the zymogen serine proteases, factors IX and XI, and
the non-enzymatic co-factor, factor VIII. The initiation
of the intrinsic pathway results in the activation of
factor XI to XIa. Factor XIa catalyzes the
