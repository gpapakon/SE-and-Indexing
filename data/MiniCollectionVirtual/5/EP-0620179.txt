<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a trolley, in particular a single-rail trolley of low overall height. The trolleys are to have a compact and simple type of construction as well as a reliable drive. To this end, they are composed according to the invention of a supporting frame (7) with running wheels (3, 3a) mounted on axles (6, 6a) and movable on the bottom flange (4) of a rail (5), a lifting mechanism (1) arranged on the supporting frame (7), a travel drive (12) for one running wheel (3a), a lever element (8) which is pivotably arranged on the axle (6a) of the driven running wheel (3a) and on the free end of which a friction wheel in drive connection with the driven running wheel (3a) is mounted via a further axle, and a spring element (13) arranged between the lever element (8) and the supporting frame (7) for setting the friction wheel (9) to the bottom flange (4) of the rail (5).

A trolley of an overhead crane, in particular a
monorail trolley of low overall height, consisting of a

supporting frame (7) with wheels (3, 3a) mounted on
axles (6, 6a), which wheels can move on the lower

flange (4) of a rail (5) extending substantially
horizontally, with a lifting mechanism (1), a

travelling gear (12) and a pivotable lever element (8),
which are each located on the supporting frame (7),

with a friction wheel (9) rotationally mounted on the
lever element (8) and a spring element (13) arranged

between the lever element (8) and the supporting frame
(7) for adjusting the friction wheel (9) on the lower

flange of the rail (5),

characterised in that

the travelling gear (12) drives a single wheel (3a) and
the friction wheel (9),
the lever element (8) is arranged pivotably coaxially
to the axle (6a) of the driven wheel (3a),
the travelling gear (12), the wheel (3a) driven by the
travelling gear (12) and the friction wheel (9), when

viewed transversely to the direction of travel, are
arranged on one side of the rail (5) and the lifting

mechanism (1) on the other side, and
a load suspension means (20) connected to the lifting
mechanism (1) is suspended beneath the rail (5) and,

viewed transversely to the direction of travel, is
offset relative to the centre of the rail by a distance

(a) from the friction wheel (9).
A trolley according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the friction wheel (9), viewed in the direction of

travel, is arranged between the wheels (3, 3a). 
A trolley according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the friction wheel (9) and the driven wheel

(3a) are each connected to a gear wheel (10a, 10b) and
the gear wheels (10a, 10b) mesh with one another.
A trolley according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the friction wheel (9) and the associated gear

wheel (10a) and also the driven wheel (3a) and the
associated gear wheel (10b) are each made of one piece.
A trolley according to one or more of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the lever element (8) is

essentially strip-shaped and a travelling gear (12) is
arranged at the end remote from the axle (6a) of the

driven wheel (3a), which gear is connected for driving
to the gear wheels (10b) of the friction wheel (9) by

means of a power take-off gear wheel (11).
A trolley according to one or more of Claims 1 to
5, characterised in that one wheel (3) is arranged

directly in each case at the front and at the rear,
viewed in the direction of travel, on the side of the

housing of the lifting mechanism (1) which faces the
lower flange (4).
