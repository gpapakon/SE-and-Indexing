<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning solution 
and to its use for cleaning silicon semiconductors and silicon 
oxides. In the course of production of semiconductor 
devices, semiconductor wafers and glass wafers 
cleaning steps are conducted before various stages. The cleaning of those wafers, for example, silicon 
wafers, is performed by a so-called SC-1 cleaning process 
using primarily a mixture of an aqueous solution of hydrogen 
peroxide/ammonia water/pure water to remove organic 
materials and deposited fine particles. However, such cleaning solution may inevitably 
cause contamination with Fe, Zn and Al which are trace metal 
contaminants in the solution. For this reason, all the 
wafers, from which metal contaminants must be removed, are 
cleaned by the SC-1 cleaning process, followed by cleaning 
with acidic solution. Acidic solution for cleaning may advantageously 
remove metal contaminants on the surfaces of wafers, but 
disadvantageously cause adhesion of fine particles 
contained in the solution onto the wafers in the course of 
cleaning. Therefore, there has been sought in the  
 
semiconductor device and silicon wafer industry a technique 
capable of cleaning wafers having less contamination with 
fine particles, if any. Similar circumstances have been 
prevailing in the field of techniques for cleaning silicon 
oxides such as quartz glass wafers. There have been known conventional practical 
methods related to the cleaning with various acids such as 
(1) an acidic solution solution containing hydrofluoric 
acid, sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide in water as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) No. Sho 58-30135, 
(2) a combination of a mixture of ammonia and 
hydrogen peroxide in water with a mixture of hydrochloric 
acid and hydrogen peroxide in water as disclosed in Japanese 
Patent KOKAI No. Hei 2-100320, (3) an acidic solution 
containing hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI No. Hei 3-273629, (4) a 
combination of the cleaning with an aqueous solution of 
hydrofluoric acid, followed by treatment with hydrogen 
peroxide as disclosed in Japanese Patent KOKAI No. Hei 4-177725, 
(5) a solution of strong acid and a very small 
amount of a compound containing fluorine as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent KOKAI No. Hei 4-234118, and (6) a solution 
containing 0.5 % hydrofluoric acid and 0.1 to 1 % hydrogen 
peroxide, with which cleaning is conducted at room 
temperature, as disclosed in, for example, "TRYBOROZIST"
