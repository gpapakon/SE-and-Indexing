<ABSTRACT>
Surfaces of fine polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) powders were modified by exposure to the downstream products of a nitrogen or oxygen microwave plasma. The effects of nitrogen and indium incorporation in the powder surface were studied with emphasis on variations in the triboelectric properties of the powder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to determine the changes in surface elemental composition. After nitrogen plasma treatment, the C 1s peak profiles suggested the formation of amines in the case of PS, and the formation of imines and amides in the case of PMMA. Oxygen plasma treatment suggested the formation of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the surfaces of both PS and PMMA. After treatment with a nitrogen or oxygen plasma, the charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) of PS and PMMA powders in contact with carrier particles was measured using the cage blowoff method. The surface charge density (Q/A) was calculated from Q/M. The Q/A of nitrogen plasma-treated PS powder was seen to shift towards positive charge with small increases in the nitrogen concentration. The Q/A of oxygen plasma treated PS powder initially shifted toward negative charge, but changed towards positive charge with higher oxygen concentrations. Plasma-treated PMMA powder showed a different behaviour and the variation of Q/A on PMMA was much less than that of PS. Results suggest that triboelectrification of the polymer powder may be related to changes in the electrical surface states, and that nitrogen may act as a group V dopant within the PS surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of improving the triboelectric properties of polymers particles by
triboelectrification, especially the fine polymer particles used in toners
in electrophotographic systems.The charging of materials by triboelectrification has been
applied to a number of industrial products for some time. Since the
invention of the electrophotographic technique used for copiers and non-impact
printers by Carlson in 1938 [see United States patent no.
2,297,691 (Carlson, 1942)], the field has developed into a large
commercial market. Recently, electrophotography has required higher
resolution images than was necessary previously, for application in colour
image systems [see E. Czech, W. Ostertag, SPIE 1253, Hard Copy and
Printing Products, 64, (1990)]. For this purpose it is very important to
control accurately the electrical charge of the fine polymer powders used
as toners in electrophotographic systems [see S. Kume, The Institute of
Electrostatics of Japan 10(5), 306 (1986)].Toners are fine polymer particles typically about 10 Âµm in
diameter mixed with various additives and usually include a coloured dye.
In a two-component development system, the toner particles are charged
by making contact with larger metal beads known as carriers [see L.B.
Schein, "Electrophotography and Development Physics", ISBN 3-see 540-18902-5,
Springer Verlag (1988)]. The toner is transferred to the
photoreceptor due to an attractive electric field to form a real image
(development). For a high quality image, it is important to control the
charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) of the toner within predetermined limits.
The Q/M varies with changes in environmental conditions and surface
properties of the toner [see N. Matsui, K. Oka and Y. Inaba, J.Electrophotographics 30(3), 282 (1991)]. Much work has
been done to investigate the triboelectrification of
fine polymer powders [see J. Henniker, Nature 196, 474
(1962); C.B. Duke and T.J. Fabish, J. Appl. Phys. 49,
315 (1978); and L.B. Schein and M. Latta, J. Appl.
Phys. 69 (10), 6817 (1991)], but the mechanisms are
still not fully understood. Some investigations
suggest that the nature of the chemical species on the
surface is the most important aspect for controlling
the triboelectric charge of the particle [see I.
Shinohara, F. Yamamoto, H. Anzai, and S. Endo, J.
Electrost. 2, 99 (1976), and H. W. Gibson, Polymer 25,
3 (1984)].According to a first aspect of the invention there
is provided a method of improving the triboelectric
properties of a polymer powder of polymer
