<ABSTRACT>
Chip cards (1), which comprise a basic body of plastic with an electronic module as data carrier, are variously manufactured. One variant is the injection-moulded plastic card. If the fitting of the electronic module (2) on the chip card (1) takes place directly in the injection-moulding operation, this module (2) must be positioned in the injection mould (7). With a view to low cycling times during injection moulding, according to the invention electronic modules (2) having electrical connection faces (3) are premounted on a thermoplastic carrier tape (4). This carrier tape is positioned for an injection-moulding operation with a module (2) in the injection mould (7) and is fixed and the chip card (1) is manufactured by injection from behind and filling of a cavity (8). The carrier tape (4) and the injection-moulded part (6) fuse together.

Method for manufacturing chip cards (1) by 
injection moulding, the chip cards (1) comprising a 

flexible card body with an integrated electronic module 
(2) as the data carrier and having externally accessible 

electrical terminal faces (3), which are connected to the 
module (2) and are placed in a predetermined position on 

the surface of a two-dimensionally formed side of the 
card body, comprising the following steps: 


mounting of packaged electronic modules (2), with 
electrical terminal faces (3) attached on their underside 

(5) or in the lower region and protruding 
laterally, on a carrier tape (4), consisting of a 

thermoplastic, the module (2) being positioned in 
relation to the carrier tape (4) and the downwardly 

pointing electrical terminal faces (3) lying approximately 
plane-parallel in a surface of the carrier tape 

(4), in such a way that the electrical terminal faces 
(3) are completely covered, at least upwards, while the 

terminal faces which are later accessible from outside 
the finished card are not covered, 
laying of the carrier tape (4) with an electronic 
module (2) into an injection mould (7) having a cavity 

(8) corresponding to a chip card (1) to be manufactured, 
in such a way that the undersides of the electrical 

terminal faces (3) and the underside (5) of the 
module (2) are placed in a predetermined position on a 

two-dimensionally formed side of the injection mould 
(7) by a clamping action effected via the carrier tape 

(4), 
injection of a thermoplastic from the same group of  
 

materials from which the carrier tape (4) is made into 
the closed injection mould (7) for manufacturing the 

chip card (1) while simultaneously encapsulating the 
electronic module (2), the thermoplastic being injected 

in such a way that the carrier tape (4) is pressed 
against the two-dimensionally formed inner wall of the 

injection mould (7) on which the module (2) is positioned, 
and the carrier tape (4) fuses integrally with 

the injection-moulded card body, 
removal of the manufactured chip card (1) and advancement 
of the carrier tape (4) until the following 

electronic module (2), located thereupon, is positioned 
in the injection mould. 
Method according to Claim 1, in which a 
polycarbonate (PC) is used as the thermoplastic for the 

carrier tape (4) and the chip card (1). 
Method according to Claim 1, in which an 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) is used for the 

carrier tape (4) and the chip card (1). 
Method according to Claim 1, in which a styrene-butadiene 
(SB) is used for the carrier tape (4) and the 

chip card (1). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which the attachment of the electrical terminal faces 

(3) on the carrier tape (4) takes place by means of 
adhesion. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which the carrier tape (4) is additionally fixed by a 

negative pressure produced between the carrier tape (4) 
and the corresponding inner wall of the injection mould 

(7). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which, for mounting the electronic modules (2) on the 

carrier tape (4), a clearance corresponding to the 
outline of the basic body of the module (2) is punched 

out in the carrier tape (4), the module (2) is inserted 
therein and the upwardly pointing sides of the electrical 

terminal faces (3) are adhesively bonded to the carrier  
 

tape (4). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which, for mounting the electronic modules (2) on the 

carrier tape (4), the basic body of the module (2) is 
embedded into the carrier tape (4) by thermoforming the 

latter upwards and sidewards and the upwardly pointing 
sides of the electrical terminal faces (3) are adhesively 

bonded to the carrier tape (4). 
Method according to one of Claims 7 or 8, in 
which pockets of adhesive (9) are produced by thermal 

preforming of the carrier tape (4).
