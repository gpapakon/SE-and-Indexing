<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for opening fibers. Preferably, the fibers are opened in the high speed production of uniform, lightweight webs by air-laydown of textile fibers. In a preferred embodiment, a rotating toothed disperser roll is used to open and doff fibers into an air stream of high uniform velocity and low turbulence to form a thin fiber stream from which the fibers are deposited inweb form on a moving screen. A curved disperser plate shrouds the disperser roll and prevents premature doffing. By using a specific disperser plate having an exposed rib length between 0.01 to 0.20 inches and a rib spacing between 0.15 to 2.0 inches, web quality is dramatically improved due to the significantly lower number of defects remaining in the web as unopened fiber chips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for opening 
fibers. In particular, the invention relates to 
improving the web quality of air-laid textile staple 
fibers by providing a modified disperser plate having a 
specific rib spacing and exposed rib length. Textile fibers used to make spun yarns, sheet 
materials and fibrous batts typically come to the 
process in compressed bales weighing several hundred 
pounds. Before yarn spinning or web forming operation 
can begin, the fibers in these bales must first be 
separated or "opened". Thus, opening must precede other 
basic operations necessary to making product. It is common industry practice to accomplish fiber 
opening by passing the compressed fibers through a 
series of opening steps wherein the fibers are "combed" 
repeatedly in an attempt to separate individual fibers. 
The devices used, commonly referred to as "openers", can 
be classified generally as endless path, gripping or 
rotating assemblies. Particular examples of opening 
devices are disclosed in W. Klein, "The Technology of 
Short-staple Spinning", The Textile Institute - Manual 
of Textile Technology, pp. 10-17 (1987). These devices 
vary in effectiveness since the degree of opening one 
can achieve is limited by a number of factors related to 
both fiber properties and equipment design. An example of a rotating assembly is set forth in 
U.S. Patent 3,797,074 (Zafiroglu) wherein a process and 
apparatus for high speed production of uniform webs from 
feed batts of staple fibers are disclosed. The batt is 
fed into a space between a toothed disperser roll,  
 
rotating at a surface speed of at least 914 m (3,000 feet) per 
minute, and a stationary, curved disperser plate which 
is closely-spaced from the disperser roll teeth to hold 
the fibers close to the roll until a fiber-doffing 
position is reached at the tip of the disperser plate. 
At this location the fibers are projected, by tangential 
ejection from the roll, through an opening into duct 
means. An air supply directs a stable stream of air, of 
uniform velocity, low turbulence and low vorticity, 
through the duct in the direction of movement of the 
roll surface so that the fibers are projected into the 
air stream at an angle of less than 25 degrees, 
preferably less than 12 degrees, to the direction of air 
flow through the duct. The fibers are carried in the air 
stream to condenser means which separates the fibers 
from the air to form webs weighing from 3.4 to 340 g/m2 from (0.1 to 10 ounces 
per square yard) as determined by

A method for opening fibers comprising the steps 
of: 


(a) supplying fibers to a rotating toothed 
disperser roll wherein the roll carries the fibers over a 

closely-spaced, stationary curved disperser plate having a 
plurality of longitudinal grooves and ribs extending across 

the plate in a direction transverse to the rotational 
direction of the roll, wherein the disperser plate has an 

exposed rib length of between (0.254 to 5.1 mm) and a rib 
spacing of between (3.81 to 51 mm); 
(b) pinning individual fibers to the teeth of the 
roll; 
(c) centrifugally throwing unopened fiber chips 
of sufficient mass off the roll and onto the ribbed 

disperser plate; 
(d) momentarily stopping, and not merely 
deflecting, the thrown unopened fiber chips using the 

exposed rib length of the ribs such that the impact of the 
unopened fiber chips with the exposed rib length of the 

ribs causes the unopened fiber chips to break up and 
separate from one another; and 
(e) repeating steps (b) through (d) until either 
the mass of unopened fibers is reduced to the point where 

the drag and friction forces on the fibers are greater than 
the centrifugal forces on the fibers or the fibers reach 

the end of the disperser plate.
