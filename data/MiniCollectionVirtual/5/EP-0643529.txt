<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is intended to provide an 
image processing apparatus capable of two-color output 

representation in high accuracy even with a full-colored 
original. 
A color original is entered by an input means for 
prescan, a density distribution with respect to a hue 

is obtained for each electric signal of color image 
information, and a characteristic point of the color 

original image is obtained from the result of the 
density distribution. The two-color separation means 

separates a full-colored original to two colors free 
from the same color representation according to the 

information of the characteristic point obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing method for color separation processing of
input image data and an apparatus thereof.As an image formation apparatus such as a digital
copying machine, there has been proposed an image
formation apparatus which reads a color original by
photoelectric conversion devices such as color CCDs or
the like, identifies respective appropriate areas from
color information of the original, and forms an image
with the identified areas in different colors (for
example, red and black).In addition, there has been proposed an image
formation apparatus which separates, for example, a red
component and a black component from color image
signals which have been read and reproduces a color
original image in two different colors so that the red
component of the color image is formed in red and the
black component in black.However, the above-described method provides the
gradation effect only in a black color and uses binary
representation for a red color. Therefore, this method
has been unsuitable for reproduction of full-color 
originals since the method is only adapted to reproduce
an image in which only applicable colors of the
original are reproduced even though an effect of the
method can be expected in that red characters contained
in a monochrome original can be reproduced in red.For reproducing an input color image in two
colors, this method has been disadvantageous in that,
if a dot non-mixing method (in which a plurality of
toner colors are not superposed in one dot) is used,
the densities of color components which have not been
applied are not maintained on the image and therefore
the density of the whole image cannot be maintained.A concern of the present invention is to provide
an image processing method and an apparatus thereof
which is capable of solving the above problems.Another concern of the present invention is to
separate colors of image data entered as shown.A further concern of the present invention
is to prevent a production of areas which become the
same color when color separation.A further concern of the present invention
is to prevent a decrease of a density which may be
caused in re-reproduction.A further concern of the present invention
is to carry out desired color separation in accordance 
with an application of a user.European patent specification No EP-A-0559471
discloses an image forming apparatus which includes means
for discriminating an input colour image signal, and a
pattern generating unit for generating a pattern image
