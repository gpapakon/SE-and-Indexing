<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling structure
of optical fibers and optical waveguides which is used in an
optical communication system as an optical waveguide module
having an optical waveguide circuit.In the field of optical communications, for the purpose
of, e.g., processing signals from optical fibers by optical
waveguides, a coupling structure in which the optical
fibers and the optical waveguides are optically coupled is
sometimes needed.For example, in a conventional coupling structure in
which optical fibers and optical waveguides are coupled by
welding, an optical fiber arranging connector in which a
multi optical fiber extending from a ribbon fiber is
arranged, and a waveguide substrate on which an optical
waveguide layer including a multi optical waveguide is
formed, are fixed in separate metal members. The end faces
of the optical fiber arranging connector and the waveguide
substrate respectively fixed in the metal members are
abutted against each other, and the optical fibers and the
optical waveguides are aligned with each other. Then, the 
metal members are welded with each other by using, e.g., a
YAG laser.In the above coupling structure, however, since the
metal members are deformed during welding, the optical
waveguides and the optical fibers cause misalignment to
increase the light transmission loss of the coupling
structure. Since the metal members are used as metal
housings of the optical fiber arranging connector and the
optical waveguide layer, the manufacturing cost becomes
very high. Thus, a demand has arisen for a coupling
structure of optical fibers and optical waveguides free
from these problems.In a conventional coupling structure in which optical
fibers and optical waveguides are coupled by using a
photo-setting (photo-curable) adhesive, a multi optical
fiber extending from a ribbon fiber is arranged by being
fixed in, e.g., the V-grooves of a glass optical fiber
arranging connector. A waveguide substrate on which an
optical waveguide layer including a multi optical waveguide
is formed is mounted in a glass member, and the optical
fibers and the optical waveguides are aligned with each
other. A photo-setting adhesive is injected between the end
faces of the optical fiber arranging connector and the glass
member to be coupled, and light is radiated from the
peripheral portion, thereby setting the photo-setting
adhesive. In order to sufficiently set the photo-setting 
adhesive, as described above, the optical fiber arranging
connector is made of a glass material
