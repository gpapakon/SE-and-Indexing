<ABSTRACT>
A split-lissajous display presents two pairs of input signals simultaneously. 
The signal pairs are used to calculate respective lissajous figures, and then one-half 

of one lissajous figure is stored in a display memory (25) with a first contrast, such 
as light on a dark background, and one-half of the other lissajous figure is stored 

in the display memory with a second contrast, such as dark on a light background. 
The contents of the display memory are scanned for display in a raster scan 

format to present the split-lissajous display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multiple signal displays, and more 
particularly to a four channel split-lissajous display that presents two lissajous 
figures on a single display. Lissajous figures are created on an instrument display by connecting one 
of a pair of signals to an x-axis input and the other of the pair to a y-axis input. 
Many audio monitor products display the phase relationship of two audio signals, 
such as the left channel and right channels of a stereo pair, with a lissajous figure. 
By observing the lissajous figure certain frequency, amplitude and phase 
characteristics of the signal pair may be determined. However this type of display 
does not lend itself to more than a single pair of input signals. With serial digital audio signals, such as AES/EBU audio, two input serial 
digital signals represent four audio signals. Using a conventional lissajous figure 
display requires some means for differentiating the two pairs of signals, and is 
likely to result in a confusing display. Color may be used to differentiate the two 
lissajous figures, but for a monochrome display providing two lissajous figures on 
the same display in an apparent simultaneous display presents a confusing display 
for an operator. What is desired is a method of simultaneously displaying two lissajous 
figures in a clear and unambiguous manner. Accordingly the present invention provides a four channel split-lissajous 
display by splitting a display screen and displaying one-half of a lissajous figure 
for one pair of signals in one-half of the screen and one-half of a lissajous figure 
for another pair of signals in the other one-half of the screen. Two pairs of  
 
signals are provided at respective inputs to an instrument and each pair is input 
selectively to the x-axis and y-axis inputs of a display device. For one-half of the 
screen the inputs to the x-axis and y-axis are for one pair of the signals, and for 
the other half the inputs are for the other pair of signals. One half of the screen 
is displayed in normal video and the other half is displayed in reverse video. 
Alternatively each half may be displayed with different grey scale backgrounds, 
or in different colors where a color display is used. Also each half is provided 
with an appropriate label to indicate the pair of signals being displayed. The objects, advantages and other novel features of the present invention 
are apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction 
with the appended claims and attached drawing.

<CLAIMS>
A method of displaying four signals in a split-lissajous display comprising 
the steps of: 

   creating two lissajous figures from the four signals, each lissajous figure 
representing the relationship between a unique pair of the four signals; and 

   displaying one-half of one lissajous figure in one-half of a display screen 
and one-half of the other lissajous figure in the other one-half of the display 

screen to provide the split-lissajous display. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the displaying step comprises the 
steps of: 

   storing the one-half of the one lissajous figure in a display memory (25) having 
a first contrast; 

   storing the one-half of the other lissajous figure in the display memory 
having a second contrast distinctive from the first contrast; and 

   displaying the contents of the display memory as the split-lissajous display. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein the first contrast presents the 
one lissajous figure as light against a dark background and the other lissajous 

figure as dark against a light background. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein the first contrast presents the 
one lissajous figure as a first color against a background of a second color and the 

other lissajous figure as a third color against a background of a fourth color. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein each storing step comprises the 
steps of: 

   initializing the contents of the display memory to be of an initial shade; 
and 

   storing the lissajous figure into the display memory as a contrasting shade.
