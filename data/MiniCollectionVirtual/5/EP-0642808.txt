Device for ambulatory treatment, formed of three
separable modules, for the transdermic administration of

drugs by electrophoresis or iontophoresis, comprising a
first active module (1) provided with at least one system

of electrodes (17, 18) and one drug reservoir (10), a
second power module (2) provided with a power supply (20)

and a third electronic module (3) provided with an
electronic circuit (30), control organs (37, 38) and a

display screen (36), characterized in that the power
module (2) is situated between said two other modules (1,

3) and in that it comprises in addition to the power
supply (20) formed by one or more batteries, on the one

hand mechanical assembly means (21, 22a, 22b) and
electrical connection or interconnection means (23a, 23b,

24, 25) with the two other modules (1, 2) and on the other
hand means for attaching (26a, 26b) to the body of a

patient.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in
that said power module (2) is formed by the assembly of a

plate (210) whose external face (211) is oriented towards
the active module (1), and a cover (220) whose external

part (221) is intended to support the electronic module
(3), the plate (210) and the cover (220) being joined

together by their opposite faces (212, 222), thereby
holding in place the means for attaching (26a, 26b) to the

body of a patient.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the external face (211) of the plate (210) comprises

a ring (21) for fixing the active module (1) provided with
discontinuities, and two electrical contacts (214, 215) on

the connection (25) with the power supply (20) and on the
interconnection (24) with the electronic module (3), said

contacts facing corresponding contacts of the active
module (1). 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in
that one of the discontinuities (216) of the ring (21)

enables the active module (1) to be positioned in a
univocal way.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the internal face (212) of the plate (210) is

structured to receive or maintain the connections and
interconnections (23a, 23b, 24, 25) between the power

supply (20) and, on the one hand the active module (1),
and on the other hand the electronic module (3).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in
that one part of the internal face (222) of the cover

(220) is open to form a casing (223) intended to receive
the power supply (20), and that the other part is closed

by a sheet (224) which houses an aperture (225) for the
connections and interconnections (23a, 23b, 24).
Device according to claim 6, characterized in
that the casing (223) is designed to receive a power

supply (20) formed by two rod-shaped batteries in series,
placed flat in a V shape on the internal face (211) of

the plate (210), the sheet (224) occupying the interior of
the V.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in
that the casing (223) is designed to receive a power

supply (20) formed by two button-shaped batteries placed
flat on the internal face (211) of the plate (210), the

sheet (224) being positioned between said button-shaped
batteries.
Device according to claims 2 and 6, characterized
in that the external part (221) of the cover (220)

comprises a casing (226) delimited by the external walls
of the casing (223) of the power supply and by the

external face of the sheet (224), and intended to receive
the electronic module (3).
Device according to claim 9, characterized in
that the casing (226) is provided with organs for the 

guidance and fixing (22a, 22b) of the electronic module
(3).
Device according to claim 10, characterized in
that the guidance and fixing organs (22a, 22b) are formed

by a dovetail cut arranged in the sheet (224).
Device according to claim 10, characterized in
that the guidance and fixing organs (22a, 22b) are formed

by rails or ribs placed on the walls of the casing (226).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in

of elastic fabric provided at their ends with velcro
Â®-type fastenings, said strips being gripped between the

plate (210) and the cover (220).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the attachment means (26a, 26b) are formed by

adhesive strips encircling all or part of the power module

(2), said strips being gripped between the plate (210) and
the cover(220).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the plate (210) and the cover (220) are formed by

moulding or thermoforming a plastic material.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the assembly of the plate (210), the cover (220) and

the attachment means (26a, 26b) is achieved by adhesive
bonding, welding or snap-fitting of complementary organs
