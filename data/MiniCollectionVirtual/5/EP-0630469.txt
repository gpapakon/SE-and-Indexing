% 5 CROSS-LINKED GAS-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE OF A CURED PERFLUORINATED URETHANE POLYMER. AND OPTICAL GAS SENSORS FABRICATED THEREWITHCross-Reference to Related Application 10 This application is a continuation-in-part ofU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/848,627, filed March 9, 1992.Technical Field15 The present invention relates generally to optical sensors for measuring dissolved gases in a fluid, and more particularly relates to a novel optical sensor system containing a gas permeable membrane of a cured perfluorinated urethane polymer.20BackgroundChemical sensors are generally known for use in a wide variety of areas such as medicine, scientific research, industrial applications and the like. Fiber25 optic and electrochemical approaches are generally known for use in situations where it is desired to detect and/or measure the concentration of a parameter at a remote location without requiring electrical communi¬ cation with the remote location. Structures, properties,30 functions and operational details of fiber optic chemicalC". sensors can be found in United States Patent No. 4,577,109 to Hirschfeld, U.S. Patent No. 4,785,814 to Kane, and U.S. Patent No. 4,842,783 to Blaylock, as well as Seitz, "Chemical Sensors Based on Fiber Optics,"35 Analytical Chemistry. Vol. 56, No. 1, January 1984, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. 

 Publications such as these generally illustrate that is it known to incorporate a chemical sensor into a fiber optic waveguide, an electrochemical gas sensor or the like, in a manner such that the chemical sensor will interact wit the analyte. This interaction results in a change in optical properties, which change is probed and detected through the fiber optic waveguide or the like. These optical properties of chemical sensor compositions typically involve changes in colors or in color intensities. In these types of systems, it is possible to detect particularly minute changes in the parameter or parameters being monitored in order to thereby provide especially sensitive remote monitoring capabilities. Chemical sensor compositions that are incorporated at the distal end of fiber optic sensors are often configured as membranes that are secured at the distal tip end of the waveguide device or optrode.Gas sensors of this general type are useful in monitoring gas concentrations such as oxygen and carbon dioxide in bloodstreams and the like. Also, it is sometimes desirable to provide sensors that monitor other parameters such as pH. Ion concentrations can also be
