Process for the manufacture of a box, comprising
a box body with a bottom and a lid with a top, characterized

in that it comprises the following steps:

cutting from a sheet of flexible material a first
strip (30;64) with a length equal to or slightly greater

than the perimeter 
P1
 of the box,
cutting from a sheet of flexible material a second
strip (32;66) with a length 
P2
 greater than the perimeter

P1
 by an amount that takes into account the thickness of
the first strip,
preparing a layer (46;72) for joining the two strips
together in a region which has a width 
l
 which is narrower
than the width of each of the two strips, and over

the entire length 
P2
 of the second strip,
winding the first strip to produce a first tube (30)
and winding the second strip around the first strip so as

to form a second tube around the first tube,
fitting the top (36,40;76) and the bottom (38,42;84)
of the box, before or after the previous step,
cutting only through the thickness of the outer tube
outside of the bonding region (46;72) of width 
l
 and
close to this region, this being done around the entire

perimeter,
detaching this second tube, with its top (36,40;76)
forming the lid, from the first tube and the rest of the

second tube which together form the box body, the outer
periphery of the lid coming in line with the outer

periphery of the box body.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that:


the first and second strips comprise an overlap
region 
ε
 and an overlap region 
λ
 respectively, and
the two strips are butted together prior to winding,
with these two strips being joined (44) over a height 
l

which is shorter than the width of each strip.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the first strip (64)

has a first width 
L'
 which is between the width 
l
 of the
joining layer (72) and the second width 
L
 of the second
strip (66).
Process for the manufacture of a box according to
any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the end overlap regions are chamfered down in order to
limit the increases in thickness.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to
any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that:


the top and underside of the lid and of the bottom
of the box respectively are produced by attaching a first

plate with external dimensions that exceed those of the
box and by attaching a second plate with external dimensions

which are between the internal and external dimensions
of the box,
the box body is milled if necessary to the dimensions
of this second plate,
the top and the underside are attached respectively
to the lid and to the box body,
the first plate is rubbed down until it has the
exact same external dimensions as the lid and/or as the

box body.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to
Claim 1, characterized in that:


a box bottom with a lip is produced;
a first strip is wound onto the lip of the bottom in
such a way that the two ends of this strip are edge to

edge; and
other strips are wound in turn onto this first
strip, their respective ends also being edge to edge.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to 
any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the length of each strip is n times the perimeter so that
a lid and a box body with n layers each are produced.
Process for the manufacture of a box according to
any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

any wording (34) to do with the product is placed on the
peripheral strip, on the top and on the underside.
Box-manufacturing line of the type comprising:

means of winding at least one strip around a
mandrel;
means of grinding and partially cutting the winding,
so as to define the lid and the box body;
means of cutting out the top and the bottom of the
box; and
means of attaching the top and the bottom;

characterized in that it allows the use of the process
according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, and comprises:
means of cutting out at least two strips of flexible
material in sheet form, at least one of which has a width

identical to the height of a box to be manufactured;
means of chamfering down the ends of the strips; and
means of spraying an adhesive substance onto part of
at least one strip;

and in that the winding means are designed to wind the
two strips concentrically one on top of the other.
Box-manufacturing line of the type comprising:

means of winding at least one strip around a
mandrel;
means of grinding and partially cutting the winding,
so as to define the lid and the box body;
means of cutting out the top and the bottom of the
box; and
means of attaching the top and the bottom;

characterized in that it allows the use of the process
according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, and comprises:
a strip feed station (210) comprising as many feed
reels as there are widths of strip needed, to obtain a

box by winding these strips under the action of the said
winding means, the reels being mounted on a mobile bench 

(240),
a station (212) for cutting these strips, this
station being secured to the mobile bench (240) and

comprising a guillotine,
a station (214) for measuring the strips, this
station being secured to the fixed bed (244) and comprising

an optical cell,
a station (216) for coating the strips with adhesive,
this station being secured to a carriage (270)

which can move at right angles to the line of travel of
the mobile bench (240), comprising a tank of adhesive and

dispensing means,
a station (218) for winding the strips one on top of
the other, this station comprising a winding head (274)

equipped with a mandrel (284) in the shape of the box to
be produced, and
a programmable automaton (219) designed to
coordinate the various movements, especially those of the

mandrel.
