<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a fruit polyphenol 
obtained by subjecting unripe fruits of Rosaceae to pressing 

and/or extraction and then purifying the resulting juice or 

extract. The present invention further provides an antioxidant, 
a hypotensive agent, an antimutagenic agent, an antiallergic 

agent and an anticariogenic agent each comprising, 
as an effective component, a fruit polyphenol obtained by 

subjecting unripe fruits of Rosaceae to pressing and/or 
extraction and then purifying the resulting juice or extract. 

The fruit polyphenol of the present invention has 
various physiological activities, for example, an antioxidative 

activity, an ACE-inhibiting activity, an antimutagenic 
activity, a hyalulonidase-inhibiting activity and a GTase-inhibiting 

activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mixture consisting essentially of polyphenols from unripe apples
and a process for producing a mixture of unripe Rosaceae fruit polyphenols.In growing the trees of Rosaceae which bear edible
fruits such as apple, pear, peach and the like, "thinning-out"
of superfluous fruits is generally carried out in the
period of mid May to mid July. In this thinning-out, unripe
fruits in the form of bunch or cluster are removed with some
of them left unremoved. Consequently, a large amount of
unripe fruits are disposed by the thinning-out, without
being utilized. These unripe fruits are very bitter as
compared with ripe fruits, and the sectional surface of each
unripe fruit turns brown easily. This fact suggests the
presence of a large amount of polyphenol compounds in unripe
fruits. It is known that polyphenol compounds are generally
present in the plant kingdom as a secondary metabolite of
plant in numerous kinds and in a large amount. Some of
these polyphenol compounds have drawn attention for their
diversified physiological activities, from the past in the
field of pharmacology and in recent years in the field of
food chemistry.Among them, tea polyphenol (catechins) is drawing
particular attention and concentrated researches are under
way thereon. This tea polyphenol is being recognized to
have very wide physiological activities such as antibacterial
activity, antiviral activity, antioxidative activity,
antimutagenic activity, anticancerous activity, platelet
coagulation-inhibiting activity, blood pressure increase-inhibiting
activity, blood sugar increase-inhibiting activity,
blood cholesterol-reducing activity, anticariogenic
activity, antiallergic activity, intestinal flora-improving
activity, deodoring activity and the like [Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) Nos. 214183/1988, 6499/1990,
178320/1992, etc.].Thus, it is known that, for example, the polyphenol
extracted from tea has wide physiological activities.An object of the present invention is to provide
a fruit polyphenol mixture having various physiological activities,
which is different from the polyphenol extracted from tea.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a process for producing a mixture of Rosaceae fruit polyphenols, notably the above fruit polyphenol mixture
effectively and economically.According to the present invention, there is
provided a mixture consisting essentially of polyphenols
obtainable by pressing or extraction of unripe apples
to form a juice or extract, treating the
