<ABSTRACT>
A peristaltic pump comprising a rotor and a plurality of removable cartridges associated with the rotor, wherein the occlusion beds of the cartridges are configured to enable the outflow characteristics of the pump to be varied by manipulation or interchanging of the cartridges, such that the pump may, in one mode of operation, have synchronous flow to all of its parallel flow channels, or may in a second mode of operation, have non-synchronous phase-offset flow to respective ones of the parallel flow channels. In the second mode of operation, manifolding of the output flow from respective ones of the parallel flow channels can be employed to provide flow of substantially reduced pulsation. Each of the cartridges preferably comprises a cartridge frame and a separate occlusion bed supported on the cartridge frame. In the second mode of operation, the occlusion beds of the cartridges preferably have regions of maximum occlusion offset relative to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to peristaltic 
pumps and more specifically to a peristaltic cartridge 
pump for pumping fluid through a plurality of lengths 
of tubing. Peristaltic pumps are preferred for certain 
applications due to their ability to pump fluids 
through tubing without any contact between pump 
components and the fluid being pumped. In a typical 
peristaltic pump system, one or more lengths of tubing 
are contacted by a series of rollers that generally 
rotate in a circular path. The peristaltic pump may 
be rotated by a variable-speed electric motor or other 
suitable drive. Peristaltic pumps with removable cartridges are 
employed to pump fluid through a plurality of flexible 
lengths of tubing simultaneously. The removability of 
the cartridges is advantageous in that it enables a 
particular length of tubing to be removed or replaced 
without disturbance of other lengths of tubing in the 
pump. US-A-4,886,431 illustrates and describes a 
cartridge pump which has proven to be well-suited for 
many laboratory applications and the like, 
particularly those wherein the capability for fine-tuning 
of the degree of occlusion is useful. The pump 
comprises a drive unit including a stationary frame 
and a rotor on said frame for rotation thereon, said 
rotor having rotatable supports and a plurality of 
elongated parallel rollers, said rollers being carried 
by said rotatable supports in a circular path about 
the axis of said rotor, each of said rollers further 
having its own axis of rotation and being rotatable 
thereabout; and a plurality of removable cartridges, 
each of said cartridges comprising a cartridge frame 
and an occlusion bed, each said occlusion bed being  
 
supported in said cartridge frame and having an 
occlusion surface thereon, each said occlusion surface 
defining a region of maximum occlusion; each of said 
plurality of removable cartridges being configured for 
cooperation with said drive unit so that for each of 
said plurality of cartridges a length of flexible 
tubing may be supported between said occlusion bed and 
said rotor such that flow through said length of 
tubing is effected by rotation of said rotor. Cartridge pumps generally draw discrete volumes 
of fluid through the tubing by positively displacing 
them rotationally between the contact points of two 
rollers of the pump and the occlusion surface of the 
cartridge as the rollers rotate around the drive unit 
rotor. The expulsion of these discrete volumes of 
fluid results in pulsed flow in the
