<ABSTRACT>
A conventional suspension system includes a load sensing valve (F) for modulating the braking force with load. An auxiliary suspension system includes air bags (10, 11) for the rear axle (B) of the vehicle. To compensate for the effect of the air bags (10, 11) compensating means (12) is provided to move the stem (32) (V) of the valve (F). The compensating means (12) is pneumatically operated from the same air supply (Ls) as to the air bags (10, 11). The compensating means (12) in one case comprises an auxiliary compensating bellows (30) mounted on a bracket (40) below the valve (F). In another arrangement the compensating means (12) is provided by a ram (65) which acts on an extension arm (67) which in turn is mounted to an arm (M) which acts on the stem (V) of the load compensating valve (F).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to auxiliary suspension systems for
vehicles, particularly light commercial vehicles and the
like.More particularly the invention relates to a vehicle
having an in situ suspension system of the type
comprising:
a suspension unit (S) for each wheel at least on the
rear axle of the vehicle;the vehicle having an hydraulically operated braking
system;a load compensating valve means (F) for controlling the
flow of braking fluid and hence the braking force
applied in accordance with load; anda load sensing and modulating means (A,C) on the axle
(B) having a load sensor mechanically operated means
between the load sensing and modulating means and the
load compensating valve means (F) to operate the valve,and an auxiliary suspension unit comprising a prepressurised
pneumatically operated bellows suspension
unit for at least the rear axle (B) of the vehicle.A vehicle braking system is designed to stop a fully laden
vehicle travelling at a given speed within a specified
distance. Consequently, some braking systems are overdesigned
for a vehicle when it is less than fully laden.
This can create an undesirable situation when the load 
variation applies to one axle of the vehicle but not to
the other. This is usually the case with commercial
vehicles where the weight carried by the front axle is
usually relative constant whereas the weight carried by
the back axle is considerably dependent on the condition
of lading. Thus, when a commercial vehicle is unladen the
braking system is not as efficient as when the vehicle is
laden.In an effort to overcome this difficulty it is known to
provide load sensing and modulating means to modulate the
braking force applied to the axles of commercial vehicles
depending on the lading conditions of the vehicle. This
gives a graduated brake output depending on the laden
conditions of the vehicle. Generally, such load sensing
and modulating means are used in association with vehicles
equipped with conventional steel springs, usually steel 
leaf springs. Typically, a load sensing valve for use
with steel springs is fixed to the vehicle chassis at a
location roughly above the back axle. The valve has an
inlet from the brake pedal of the vehicle and an outlet
which leads to the pneumatic or hydraulic brake actuators
of the vehicle. In one case the load sensing valve is
operated by a torsion bar which is rigidly fixed to the
axle by means of a connecting link. The other end of the
torsion bar acts against the stem of the load sensing
valve to modulate the flow of
