<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for operating a high-pressure discharge lamp, in particular a high-pressure metal halide (metal halogenide) discharge lamp. The lamp is supplied with a medium-frequency alternating current component of between 10 kHz and 100 kHz, the frequency and shape of the alternating current component being selected in such a manner that resonances are generated which stand radially in the discharge medium, that is to say perpendicular with respect to the discharge gap (discharge path) and which are suppressed by the convection-induced bending of the discharge arc in the case of a horizontal operating position of the lamp.

<CLAIMS>
Method for operating a high-pressure discharge
lamp (1), the high-pressure discharge lamp (1)


having a discharge vessel (2) with an approximately
rotationally symmetrical discharge space and an

ionizable filling, which is enclosed in a gastight
fashion in the discharge vessel (2) and consists of

a noble gas or a noble gas mixture, at least one
metal halide additive and, possibly, mercury,
being operated in a horizontal operating position,
and
being fed with a medium-frequency alternating-current
component (F
V
) of between 10 kHz and
100 kHz, which generates acoustic resonances in the

discharge medium,

characterized in that the frequency and the shape of the
alternating-current component are selected in such a way

that standing radial acoustic waves are excited in the
discharge medium, the frequency F
V
 of the alternating-current
component and the fundamental frequency F
R
 of the
standing acoustic radial waves approximately fulfilling

the following relationship:

n·2F
V
 = m·F
R

m, n being integers.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that approximately the relationship 3· 2F
V
 = 2F
R
 or
F
V
 = 1/3 F
R
 between the frequency F
V
 of the alternating-current
component and the fundamental frequency F
R
 is
approximately fulfilled. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that approximately the relationship 2· 2F
V
 = F
R
 or
F
V
 = 1/4 F
R
 between the frequency F
V
 of the alternating-current
component and the fundamental frequency F
R
 is
approximately fulfilled.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the fundamental frequency F
R
 of the radial acoustic
resonance is determined in accordance with the formula

F
R
 = 3.83 C/(2πR), in which R signifies the radius of the
rotationally symmetrical discharge space, and C signifies

the speed of sound in the discharge medium averaged along
the radius R.
