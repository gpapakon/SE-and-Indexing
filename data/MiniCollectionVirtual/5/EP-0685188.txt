<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dismountable cabinets consisting of
a frame, made up of a series of joint-assembled members, covered by a
fabric covering, and in particular to a dismountable cabinet provided with
doors having a structure similar to that of the cabinet body.It is known that there are several kinds of dismountable cabinets
provided with one or more openings, usually obtained by means of zips
which allow the partial or complete separation of a strip of the covering
fabric. Therefore, said openings consist of soft strips of fabric, which are
usually rolled up and retained by straps, or let down, etc. It is clear that
this type of opening is very unpractical in the case of cabinets which are
frequently opened, since it involves a significant waste of time. Moreover,
the strip of soft fabric may be an obstacle or it may get dusty when falling
to the floor, etc.A partial solution to these problems is provided by DE-A-1.529.668
disclosing a cabinet wherein a frame is provided inside these openable
strips so as to obtain rigid doors hinged to the frame of the cabinet body.
However, these doors are still integral with the covering of the body and
closed thereon by a zip.Another kind of dismountable cabinet is disclosed in FR-E-95.225
wherein separate doors are hinged to the front panel of the body through a
soldering or gluing line forming the pivoting axis of the door. Flexible
plastic strips are provided as a reinforcement to alleviate the load on the
soldering/gluing line. However, this arrangement produces a permanent
connection between the doors and the body of the cabinet, thus
jeopardizing the complete dismountability of the cabinet.Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a
dismountable cabinet suitable to overcome the above-mentioned
drawbacks by including doors having a structure similar to that of the
cabinet body and removably hinged thereto.This object is achieved by means of a dismountable cabinet having
the characteristics cited in claim 1.The first clear advantage of the present cabinet is to combine the
advantages of lightness and practicality of the dismountable cabinets with
the convenience of having rigid opening doors like in conventional hard 
cabinets.Another significant advantage of this cabinet is that each door is
separately removable from the body whereby a great flexibility of use is
achieved and partial dismounting is possible for ease of transport.These and other advantages and characteristics of the cabinet
according to the present invention
