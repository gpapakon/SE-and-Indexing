<ABSTRACT>
A silicon oxide depositing source is a 
mixture of a metallic silicon powder and a 

silicon dioxide powder. Both the powders are 
finely divided to a mean particle size of up to 

20 µm. They are mixed to give an oxygen to 
silicon atom ratio between 1.2:1 and 1.7:1. The 

source is adapted to be evaporated by an 

electron beam heating technique, allows the 
power of an electron beam to be increased 

without a splash phenomenon, and eventually 
deposits a silicon oxide thin film having 

transparency and improved barrier properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to silicon oxide 
depositing sources, especially for vacuum deposition by 
electron beam heating to form a silicon oxide thin film, 
and to corresponding deposition methods. It also relates 
to substrates such as plastic films having such silicon 
oxide coatings thereon. Transparent barrier films are manufactured 
by evaporating and depositing a silicon oxide 
thin coating on plastic web as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 
12953/1978 and Japanese Patent Application Kokai 
(JP-A) No. 253434/1989. Induction heating and 
resistance heating techniques are conventional 
for such evaporation. Recently, sputtering and 
electron beam heating techniques are employed  
 
for the purpose of improving film properties. There is 
also a growing tendency to use a mixture of metallic 
silicon and silicon dioxide as a source of deposition 
material, rather than silicon monoxide alone as was 
previously used, partly because of low cost. Among the evaporating techniques, the 
electron beam heating technique has the 
advantage of achieving efficient evaporation by 
locally concentrating the energy of an electron 
beam, but, as described in JP-A 15526/1991, 
suffers from a lowering of vacuum and an 
unstable deposition rate upon evaporating metal 
oxide. As the power of an electron beam is 
increased the beam may be disturbed by 
charge build-up of electrons, and grains of the 
deposition source can be splashed as such 
without being vaporized, which is known as a 
splash phenomenon. These deteriorate the film 
quality. One countermeasure is to mix a metal such 
as magnesium or aluminum with the metal oxide. 
When a mixture of metallic silicon and silicon 
dioxide was evaporated onto a transparent plastic 
web, it was difficult to produce a thin film 
which satisfied both full colorless transparency  
 
and barrier properties. For these reasons, the electron beam 
heating technique as applied to the evaporation 
of a mixture of metallic silicon and silicon 
dioxide is rather low in deposition rate and so, 
low in productivity as compared with the 
resistance heating and induction heating 
techniques. A general aim herein is to provide new and useful 
materials and techniques for evaporative deposition of 
silicon oxide, by an electron beam heating technique. 
Preferred aims include, independently but preferably 
simultaneously, 
to be able to maintain stable evaporation even at 
increased electron beam power; to be able to form a silicon oxide thin film with 
good
