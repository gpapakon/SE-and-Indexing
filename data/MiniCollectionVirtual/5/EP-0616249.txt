<ABSTRACT>
A device is now to be created, in which no high strains due to natural or artificial weights for the damping of vibrations from the ground or coming from the machine exert pressure on the floor. By means of the device it is to be possible to work with absolute precision and with the required image resolution or even with higher image resolution when appropriate recording and/or reproduction devices are present. A rotating drum (1), which carries the picture to be scanned or the film material, is mounted, together with a drive (12) and reading and reproduction heads (2) operating radially with respect to the drum (1), in a frame (3), and the frame (3) is fastened on a rack (4) by means of vibration dampers (50a, 50b, 50c, 50d). In this way, the frame (3) can vibrate freely and in a manner damped only by the vibration dampers (50a, 50b, 50c, 50d). The drum (1) and the optical reading and reproduction device (2) in particular vibrate rigidly together and no image point changes result due to a miscellaneous uncontrollable, infinitesimal vibration.
