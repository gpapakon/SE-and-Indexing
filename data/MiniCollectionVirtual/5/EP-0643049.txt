<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones. In general, 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones can be synthesized according to the 
known processes represented by the following reaction equations: 
The above-mentioned processes have been found to be not useful as industrially 
utilizable processes due to the following points: 
1) the reaction is of non-aqueous nature with the reaction procedures and 
reaction conditions being difficult to select,  
 2) isocyanates, particularly methylisocyanate and heterocyclic series isocyanates, 
the starting compounds, are difficult to handle and manufacture, 3) in case of a reaction using aluminum chloride, only 1 mol of sodium azide 
reacts per 1 mol of isocyanate with the remaining two mols of unreacted 
sodium azide being decomposed and thrown away, in spite of sodium azide 
being an expensive material, 4) aluminum chloride to be used as catalyst in the reaction is difficult to be 
disposed by drainage, and 5) azidotrimethylsilane is more expensive than sodium azide, while the yield of 
product is sometimes poor even under a prolonged reaction time. Further, Journal of Organic Chemistry, 33 (I), 262-265 (1968) discloses the following 
reaction with a yield of 45%:
