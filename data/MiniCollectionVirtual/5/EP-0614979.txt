<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a hog 
cholera virus vaccine comprising a polypeptide 

characteristic of hog cholera virus. Vector vaccines 
capable to express a nucleic acid sequence encoding 

such a polypeptide also form part of the present 
invention. Said polypeptide and nucleic acid sequence 

can also be used for the detection of hog cholera 

virus infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a nucleic 
acid sequence, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule 
comprising such a nucleic acid sequence, a recombinant 
expression system comprising such a recombinant 
nucleic acid molecule, a polypeptide characteristic of 
the hog cholera virus, a vaccine comprising such a 
polypeptide or recombinant expression system as well 
as a method for the preparation of such vaccines. Classical swine fever or hog cholera (HC) 
represents an economically important disease of swine 
in many countries worldwide. Under natural conditions, 
the pig is the only animal known to be susceptible to 
HC. Hog cholera is a highly contagious disease which 
causes degeneration in the walls of capillaries, 
resulting in hemorrhages and necrosis of the internal 
organs. In the first instance hog cholera is 
characterized by fever, anorexia, vomiting and 
diarrhea which can be followed by a chronic course of 
the disease characterized by infertility, abortion and 
weak offsprings of sows. However, nearly all pigs die 
within 2 weeks after the first symptoms appear. The causative agent, the hog cholera virus (HCV) 
has been shown to be structurally and serologically 
related to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) of 
cattle and to border disease virus (BDV) of sheep. 
These viruses are grouped together into the genus 
pestivirus within the family togaviridae. The nature 
of the genetic material of pestiviruses has long been 
known to be RNA, i.e. positive-strand RNA which lacks 
significant polyadenylation. The HCV probably 
comprises 3-5 structural proteins of which two are 
possibly glycosylated. The number of non-structural 
viral proteins is unknown.  
 Modified HCV vaccines (comprising attenuated or 
killed viruses) for combating HC infection have been 
developed and are presently used. However, infection 
of tissue culture cells to obtain HCV material to be 
used in said modified virus vaccines, leads to low 
virus yields and the virions are hard to purify. 
Modified live virus vaccines always involve the risk 
of inoculating animals with partially attenuated 
pathogenic HCV which is still pathogenic and can cause 
disease in the inoculated animal or offspring and of 
contamination by other viruses in the vaccine. In 
addition the attenuated virus may revert to a virulent 
state. There are also several disadvantages using 
inactivated vaccines, e.g. the risk of only partial 
inactivation of viruses, the problem that only a low 
level of immunity is achieved requiring additional 
immuniz
