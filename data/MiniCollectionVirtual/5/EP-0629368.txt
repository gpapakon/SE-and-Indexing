<ABSTRACT>
A support deck for a sofa bed having a plurality of support members 
(32) interconnected at joints (40) such that when a force is applied to 

one side of the deck the deck will yield but when a force is applied to 
the opposite side, the deck will be relatively unyieldable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a deck for seating or bedding,
and to a sofa bed including a deck (see for instance US-A-1353579).
It may also relate to a method and
apparatus for providing a support deck for a mattress or a seat. The
deck of the present invention is particularly suitable for use in sofa
beds although the invention need not be limited thereto.As used herein, the term "Deck" connotes apparatus for supporting
seating, bedding or the like.In the past, sofa bed mattress decks have been made with link fabrics
or polypropylene which are attached to an outside frame with hooks or
helicals. The link fabric decks have an
inherent flaw because they are comprised of a grid of wires which
are free to pivot or yield thus offering little resistance when a
person sits or rests on the unfolded sofa bed; this effect is known
in the industry as "hammocking". The sofa bed decks made from
polypropylene also suffer from the same inherent flaw in that they
consist of a canvas-type material attached to a frame with hooks
or helicals which simply are not resilient or strong enough to
provide proper support for a person sitting or resting on the sofa
bed.Another problem with the prior art is what is known in the
industry as "crowning". Crowning occurs when the sofa bed
mattress, after having been folded and recessed back into the sofa,
is so thick as to push upwards against the sofa bed deck causing
a bulge because the sofa bed deck is not strong enough to restrain
the compacted mattress. This bulge then makes it impossible for
seat cushions to lay flat on the sofa, a condition known in the
industry as cushion "smiling". Sitting on a sofa with "smiling"
cushions is also unpleasant since one sits on a firm bulge of
mattress almost teetering back and forth.The present invention involves the use of a unique 
interlocking grid system in a support deck in order to eliminate mattress "hammocking",
"crowning" and seat cushion "smiling" in sofa beds.An aim of the present invention is to provide a unique deck structure that may be used
in sofa beds or other seating or bedding support systems.Another aim of the present invention is to provide a novel sofa bed mattress deck that
eliminates the problem of "hammocking" identified above. Another aim of the present
invention is to provide a mattress deck that will also eliminate mattress "crowning" and
cushion "smiling".It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a sofa bed mattress deck that
can accommodate a thicker or longer sofa bed mattress yet at the same

<CLAIMS>
A deck (12) for seating or bedding including a plurality of support members
(32; 70; 81, 82; 100; 110, 111) arranged in a grid and extending generally in the same

direction to form a support, said support members having adjacent ends (33, 33a; 68; 81a,
82a; 115, 116) connected to each other for movement relative to each other, characterised

in that said deck comprises:

means including stops (36; 62; 91, 92, 93, 94; 103; 117, 118) included on said
members (32; 70; 81, 82, 100; 110, 111), arranged such that upon movement of said

members in one direction the stops (36; 62; 91, 92, 93, 94; 103; 117, 118) will engage a
support member to limit movement and upon movement of the members (32; 70; 81, 82;

100; 110, 111) in a direction opposite said one direction the stops will be spaced from the
support member to permit movement in said opposite direction.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 1, wherein said stops (36; 62; 91, 92; 103;
117, 118) are provided intermediate the ends of said support members (32; 70; 81, 82; 100;

110, 111).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 1, wherein said stops (36; 62; 91, 92; 103;
117, 118) are provided at opposite ends of said support members (32; 70; 81, 82; 100; 110,

111).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 1, wherein said stops include pivot pins (91,
92; 101; 112) in the ends of said support members (81, 82; 100; 110, 111).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 3, wherein the opposite ends (115, 116) of
each support member (110, 111) are provided with recesses and projections mating with

recesses and projections on adjacent support members.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 5, wherein the opposite ends (115, 116) of each
of the support members (110, 111) are bifurcated and receive mating bifurcated end portions

of adjacent support members. 
The deck (12) defined in Claim 1, wherein said support members (110, 111)
have planar surfaces on one side thereof.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 7, wherein said support members (32; 70; 81,
82; 100; 110, 111) are made from extruded plastic.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 1, wherein said means includes a pair of
laterally spaced pivots (91, 92) receiving the ends of said members (81, 82).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 9, wherein said members are arranged into two
groups, each group of support members (81, 82) having four wire-like members whose ends

are connected by one of said pivots (91, 92).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 9 or 10, wherein said pivots (91, 92) are
included in a generally U-shaped member (95) having opposite legs (93, 94) forming said

pivots.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 10, wherein said ends of the wire-like
members (81, 82) are apertured and receive said pivots (91, 92).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 10 or 11, wherein said ends of the wire-like
members (81, 82) are bent into loops (81a, 82a) defining apertures receiving said pivots (91,

92).
The deck (12) defined in Claim 9, 10, 11 or 13, wherein said pivots (91, 92)
prevent pivoting of the support members (81, 82) about said pivots (91, 92) in one direction

but allow pivoting of said members (81, 82) about said pivots (91, 92) in an opposite
direction.
The deck (12) defined in Claim 10, wherein ends of the members of one group
(81) are located between ends of the members of the other group (82). 
The deck (12) defined in Claim 10, 11, 13 or 14, wherein said ends of the

having a series of apertures (86, 87, 88) spaced along the frame with several apertures offset

outwardly of the frame relative to other apertures, and a plurality of links (85) received in
said apertures (86, 87
, 88) and connected to support members (81, 82) for suspending the
support members (81, 82) from the frame (83).

when in a generally coplanar position relative to the adjacent support member, said body

being integrally formed and having a generally planar surface on one side thereof.
A sofa bed including a deck (12) defined in any of the preceding claims.
