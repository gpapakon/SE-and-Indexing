<ABSTRACT>
In an active control noise-cancelling muffler system, a substantially complete acoustic and mechanical decoupling of the noise-cancelling signal pipe from the gas exhaust pipe (13) is achieved. The noise-cancelling signal delivery pipe is physically isolated and separate from the gas exhaust pipe, and is mounted separately. The outlet ends of both pipes are essentially coplanar. Using pressure sensors (17, 18) on the tubes, the system also accurately and continuously electronically replicates the mixing of the exhaust noise and the noise-cancelling acoustic energy that goes on in the space immediately beyond the two outlets. This electronic signal is a useful alternative for a direct measure of the resultant two acoustic waves when they mix in the space beyond the tube outlets, and allows the system to continuously estimate the degree of success of noise cancellation without having to measure it directly when impractical. The system (30) uses measures of pressure (17, 18) and temperature (36, 37) of the two tubes to continuously adjust a transducer drive signal that drives the sum of the pressures at the two tube outlets toward zero. An advantageous algorithm for the control process is identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to internal combustion
engine exhaust gas systems.Active noise-cancelling muffler systems used with internal combustion
engines typically include means for monitoring selected parameters of the exhaust
system and gas flow; and using the parameters, developing a noise-cancelling
acoustic waveform. The "counter-acoustic wave" typically is formed first as an
electrical waveform generated by a controller. The controller may be a computer or
chip driver connected to an amplifier for a transducer that generates the cancelling
signal. The cancelling wave and the exhaust gas energy continuously subtractively
combine to effect the desired noise reduction. See, e.g., JP-A-02234599.In active noise-cancelling muffler systems, it is necessary to control the
noise-cancelling acoustic signal both spatially and temporally so that the negative-going
pulses of the cancelling wave coincide with the positive-going pulses of the
exhaust gasses. The prior art teaches a variety of control strategies, using various
physical structures to contain the transducer and launch the counter-acoustic wave.
However, the physical design of the systems as well as the efficiency of the control
signal leave much to be desired in terms of cost and reliability.The controller requires accurate information as to the upstream exhaust
gas reference pressure in order to generate a useful transducer input signal. One
problem with many such systems of the prior art is that acoustic or mechanical
coupling occurs between the counter-acoustic wave generator and the exhaust system
of the IC engine. Readings of the exhaust gas reference pressure that are perturbed
by mechanical or acoustical coupling from the noise cancelling apparatus,
complicate the controller's function by requiring more complex and time-consuming
computations to compensate for the perturbations. If the actual on-going reference
gas pressure fluctuations is substantially obscured by such perturbations, the
functionality of the system may be defeated altogether. A continuously effective noise reduction system requires constant
adjusting of the cancelling waveform to changing conditions which include exhaust
temperature, frequency and amplitude. Ideally, despite the changing conditions, the
exhaust gas acoustic energy is driven by the cancelling waveform toward zero at all
times.The degree of success in achieving full cancellation depends in part on
continuously measuring the actual noise reduction occurring at the exhaust pipe
outlet. The measurement of noise
