<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker actuating mechanism has a magnetic frame (120) and 
a load coil (122), with a magnetic pole piece (116) which is aligned with 

the axis of the coil. An elongate L-shaped armature (128) pivots on the 
magnetic frame and has a head (130) which moves transversely relative 

to the axis of the coil towards the pole piece. The pole piece is typically 
circular in section, and the head of the armature has a circular recess 

(134) which matches the shape of the pole piece. The head of the 
armature has a pair of projections (146, 148) which extend relatively 

close to the pole piece when the armature is in a retracted position, 
increasing the initial attractive force between the pole piece and the 

armature. The mechanism is relatively simple and economical to 
manufacture, and offers an improved pull-in force.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a circuit breaker actuating mechanism. A conventional circuit breaker has a coil which carries a load current 
and which is disposed in relation to a magnetic frame so that current in 
the coil causes a magnetic flux in the frame. The coil has a pole piece 
at one end, which concentrates the magnetic flux, and an armature which 
is typically pivoted on or adjacent to the magnetic frame and which is 
attracted axially towards the pole piece. The armature and its associated 
components must be formed accurately and must pivot freely if the 
circuit breaker is to be reliable and have predictable operating 
characteristics. This tends to increase the cost of the circuit breaker. From GB-A-905 641 there is known a circuit breaker actuating mechanism 
comprising: 
a magnetic frame; a coil arranged to carry a load current and defining an axis; a magnetic pole piece 
arranged to concentrate magnetic flux due to current in the coil; 
and an armature supported by the magnetic frame and being movable  
 
transversely relative to the axis of the coil towards the pole piece 
due to magnetic attraction between the armature and the pole 
piece. According to the invention a circuit breaker actuating mechanism comprises the features of claim 1. The armature is preferably L-shaped and is connected to the magnetic 
frame at the top of the L, with the head of the armature formed in the 
foot of the L. The pole piece may be circular in section, with the head of the armature 
having a complemental circular recess formed therein. The head of the armature preferably defines at least one projecting end 
portion which is disposed relatively close to the pole piece when the 
armature is in a retracted position, to increase the initial attractive force 
between the pole piece and the armature when the armature is pulled 
in. The clearance between the at least one projecting end portion of the 
head of the armature and the pole piece is preferably at least twice as 
small as the clearance between a central portion of the head of the 
armature and the pole piece. The armature may have a retaining formation at the end thereof 
opposite the head which engages a complemental formation formed in 
the magnetic frame, to allow pivotal movement of the armature relative 
to the frame. The retaining formation of the armature is preferably a projecting tab  
 
and the complemental formation in the magnetic frame is preferably an 
aperture which receives the tab. The armature may be biased into a retracted position
