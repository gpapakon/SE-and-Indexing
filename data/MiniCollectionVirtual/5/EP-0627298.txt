<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for molding a parison (200) of 
thermoplastic material to form a container (22) with an inwardly extending flange 

(478) around the container closure (30). The container body portion is filled with 
product through an access opening (24). An insert article (30) serving as the 

container closure is then positioned within the access opening (24). The parison 
(200) is radially compressed inwardly against the insert article (30) to form a bead 

(470) of thermoplastic material contiguous with the insert article (30). The bead 
(470) is then permanently deformed against the insert article (30) axially in the 

direction of the container body portion. This forms a flange (478) over a portion 
of the insert article (30) to retain it on the container (22) while sealing the 

container (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
method and apparatus for forming and filling a container
and then occluding the container opening with an insert
to create a sealed package having a retaining flange
surrounding the insert.In one type of conventional liquid container
the dispensing opening is sealed with an insert article
that includes a rubber stopper. The container is
initially molded to provide a dispensing opening, and
the container is then filled through the opening with a
product. Subsequently, the insert article with the
rubber stopper is positioned in the container opening.
Thereafter, in a separate operation, a top portion of
the container is formed into a rim or flange around the
insert article to securely hold the insert article and
the stopper in place.The above-described conventional package is
utilized for medical applications to accommodate the
dispensing of a liquid medicament through a spike or
cannula which pierces the rubber stopper. The package
can be inverted to permit gravity discharge. This
technique can be employed in a conventional intravenous
administration system. The spike or cannula can be
withdrawn from the rubber stopper when desired. Because
the rubber stopper is retained in the package by a
peripheral flange on the container, the pull-out forces
applied to the stopper by the spike or cannula do not
dislodge the stopper. US 3,919,374 discloses a method and apparatus of blow-molding
a container utilising a parison in the form of an elongated hollow tube
extruded between the mold halves of a split mold. The split mold is
provided with a container-forming cavity and a second cavity which is
disposed beneath the container cavity and arranged to receive therein an
auxiliary component, such that the auxiliary component is molded as a
part of the container once the parison has been blown and the split
cavity opened. A plug attachment which may be a rubber is introduced
into the second cavity, the parson extruded about the plug attachment
and the split mold closed. The parison is then blown to form the
container and the plug attachment, when the container is removed from
the mold, is molded as a part of the container. The container may also
be filled and sealed before it is removed from the mold.Although packages manufactured in accordance with the above-described
multi-step process function well for their intended purposes, it
would be desirable to provide in improved manufacturing process and
apparatus for carrying out the process in a simple, uninterrupted
procedure.

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a package (20) comprising the steps:

molding a parison (200) of a thermoplastic material to form a container
body portion (22) while maintaining an access opening (24) thereto;
filling said container body portion (22) with a product;
positioning an insert article (30) within said access opening (24);
compressing said parison (200) radially inwardly against said insert
article to form a bead (470) of said thermoplastic material about said insert

article; and
permanently deforming said bead against said insert article so as to
form a flange (38, 478) over a portion of said article to retain said article on

said container; characterised by said step of permanently deforming said
bead including compressing said bead axially downwardly against a portion of

the top of said insert article (30).
The method in accordance with claim 1 in which said step of
compressing said parison includes squeezing said parison with mold parts

radially inwardly against a side of said insert article.
The method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2 in which said
step of permanently deforming said bead (470) to form said flange (38, 478)

includes imbedding a portion of said flange in a recess (42) defined by said
insert article (30).
The method in accordance with any of claims 1 to 3 in which
said step of compressing said parison (200) is carried out to form said bead

(470) contiguous with a top edge of said insert article (30).
An apparatus for forming a package (20) comprising:

molding means for forming a parison (200) of a thermoplastic material
into a container body portion (22) while maintaining an access opening (24)

thereto; 
positioning means for locating an insert article (30) within said access
opening (24);
radial pressing means for compressing said parison (200) radially
inwardly against said insert article (30) to form a bead (470) of said

thermoplastic material contiguous with said insert article (30); and
axial pressing means for permanently deforming said bead (470)
against said insert article (30) axially in the direction of the container body

portion (22) so as to form a flange (38, 478) over a portion of said insert article
(30) to retain said insert article (30) on said container; characterised in that

said axial pressing means includes a ram (422) slidably mounted on a hollow
sleeve (404) for pressing said bead axially downwardly against a portion of

the top of said insert article (30).
The apparatus in accordance with claim 5 in which said radial
pressing means includes upper mold parts (308, 310) for squeezing said

parson radially inwardly against a side of said insert article (30).
The apparatus in accordance with claim 5 or 6 in which

said ram (422) is provided with an annular end wall for engaging said
bead (470); and
said end wall defines a circumferential channel therein.
