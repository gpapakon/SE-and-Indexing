<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an espagnolette lock with a reduction gear, with an espagnolette connecting slide actuable by a locking mechanism and displaceable parallel to the fore-end and with a latch retractable transversely to the fore-end as a result of a reversing lever loadable by a stop assigned to the espagnolette connecting slide. So that the latch can be matched in an optimum manner to different conditions of installation, provision is made for the advancing position of the latch (7) to be adjustable as a result of an adjustability of the play of movement of the reversing lever (30).

Driving bar lock having a reduction gear, a
driving bar connecting slider (27, 28) actuable by lock

gearing and displaceable parallel to the weather plate
(1), and a catch bolt (7) capable of being locked back

transversely with respect to the weather plate (1) due
to a shift lever (30) which can be acted on by a limit

stop assigned to the driving bar connecting slider,
characterised in that the position of advancement of the

catch bolt (7) can be set by means of the adjustability
of the range of movement of the shift lever (30).
Driving bar lock according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the shift lever (30) runs

approximately parallel to the weather plate (1).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that an adjustable

fixed limit stop (39) restricting the ability of the
shift lever (30) to pivot is provided for adjusting the

range of movement.
Driving bar lock according to Claim 3,
characterised in that the fixed limit stop (39) is

operable from the weather plate side and is constructed
as a grub screw acting on the shift lever (30).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the shift lever

(30) constructed as a two-arm lever can be acted upon at
the end of one lever arm (35) by a front end thrust edge

(27') of the driving bar connecting slider (27).
Driving bar lock according to Claim 5,
characterised in that the thrust edge (27') through the

interposition of a driving bar return spring (45) acts
on the shift lever (30), the spring excursion of the 

driving bar return spring (45) preferably conforming to
the maximum pivot excursion of the shift lever (30).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the catch bolt

(7) designed in the form of a roller-type catch bolt has
a box-shaped profile section (9) which in the maximum

position of advancement which can be set projects over
the weather plate (1).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the catch bolt

(7) possesses at its tail end a receiving space (36) for
the longer lever arm (34) of the shift lever (30)

constructed especially as a pocket and having two
opposite limit stops (37, 38).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the gear ratio

of the shift lever arms (35, 34) is 1:10, it being
preferred that a displacement excursion of the driving

bar connecting slider of 1 to 1.3 mm is accompanied by a
catch bolt back-locking excursion of 10 mm.
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims characterised by a driving bar return

spring (45) which is put under tension in the transition
from the first to the third position by a limit stop

surface (27', 51') assigned to the driving bar
connecting slider and the elasticity of which is

sufficient to shift back the driving bar connecting
sliders (27, 28) and any driving bar breeches

independently into the first position.
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised by two driving bar

connecting sliders (27, 28) capable of displacement in
opposite directions which are driven by a final gear 

wheel (26) of a toothed-wheel gear engaging by its power
take-off gearing in a tooth construction of the driving

bar connecting slider (27, 28).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the driving bar

connecting slider (27) runs immediately adjacent to the
weather plate (1).
Driving bar lock according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the driving bar

connecting slider return spring (45) engages on a cam
(51) of the driving bar connecting slider (27).
Driving bar lock according to Claim 13,
characterised in that the cam (51) runs through a tooth-free

region (26') of the power take-off gearing of the
final gear wheel (26), especially in the transition from

the first to the second position.
Driving bar lock according to one of Claims 11 to
14, characterised in that the diameter of the drive

gearing of the final gear wheel (26) corresponds
approximately to the distance between the door knob (13)

or door knob housing (12) and the weather plate (1).
