<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an intelligent 
transient eliminator (12) which allows a gas ignition 

system to prevent gas valves (22) from being turned off 
by a pressure switch (18) in response to a transient 

pressure wave. The transient eliminator (12) is 
preferably provided in a HVAC unit or furnace (10) which 

burns a fuel such as natural gas. An ignition control 
system employing an intelligent transient eliminator (12) 

provides a secondary relay (44) across the pressure 
switch (18). The secondary relay (44) is controlled by a 

signal to an ignitor (24) in the furnace (10). The 
secondary switch (44) is tested before energizing the 

inducer/blower (14) in the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an HVAC unit 
such as a furnace or boiler which utilizes a burner or 
combustion chamber for burning fuel in order to provide 
heat. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to an ignition system or ignition control which lights or 
ignites a fuel such as natural gas, propane, or other 
combustible fuels. HVAC units such as furnaces and boilers ignite 
and burn propane or natural gas or other fuel in order to 
provide heat. A furnace is generally comprised of a 
combustion chamber, an inducer/blower, a gas valve, an 
ignitor, and an ignition control system. The gas is 
burned in a combustion chamber or burner. Generally, an 
inducer/blower is coupled to the combustion chamber and 
provides combustion air to the combustion chamber. 
Combustion air is needed for efficient operation of the 
furnace. The combustion air generally increases the 
pressure within the combustion chamber. Generally, furnaces are turned ON and OFF and 
otherwise monitored by a gas ignition control system or 
controller. The gas ignition control system is generally 
coupled to at least one pressure switch which is located 
in the combustion chamber. The pressure switch may be 
located before or after the combustion chamber as long as 
the pressure switch is in a position to sense or monitor 
pressure within the combustion chamber. The pressure  
 
switch is normally closed if the proper threshold 
pressure is reached in the combustion chamber. If the 
furnace is operated without proper pressure from the 
combustion air in the combustion chamber, a furnace 
malfunction may occur. The gas ignition control system controls the 
operation of the inducer/blower, the gas valve, and the 
ignitor in order to ensure proper operation of the 
furnace. The gas valves control the supply of 
gas to the combustion chamber. The gas valves, relays 
which control the gas valves, or both are electrically 
powered through the pressure switch. The pressure switch 
thus operates to automatically shut off the gas valves 
when the pressure switch is open. When the gas valves 
are shut off, the gas flame in the combustion chamber is 
extinguished. Alternatively, the ignition system may 
monitor the state of the pressure switch and shut off the 
gas valves when the pressure switch is open. Gas in the furnace is ignited by the ignitor. 
Upon ignition, a "transient pressure wave" is produced. 
The "transient pressure wave" momentarily decreases the 
pressure in the combustion chamber and may cause the 
pressure switch
