<ABSTRACT>
In a method for stabilizing the surface of a soil layer for a track, the ballast beneath a track is continuously taken up and cleaned, while at the same time the surface of a soil layer which has been uncovered beneath the track is mixed with aggregate, levelled and compacted to form a protective layer, after which the ballast is released onto the new protective layer. The aggregate is deposited directly onto the surface of the soil layer and mixed with it beneath the track.

A method for stabilising the soil formation of a track, 
in which the ballast is continuously taken up underneath a 

track and cleaned as necessary, while at the same time the 
exposed soil formation underneath the track is mixed with 

additional materials and is levelled and consolidated, forming 
a protective layer, whereupon the ballast is discharged onto 

the new protective layer, characterised in that the additional 
materials are applied directly to the exposed soil formation 

and are mixed with the said soil formation underneath the 
track by the penetration therein of mixing elements. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
immediately following the removal of the ballast, the topmost 

layers of the soil formation are broken up by means of ripper 
teeth, and in the same procedure the additional materials are 

introduced into the gaps. 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
first, cement is introduced into the gaps in the soil 

formation and if necessary a mixture of water and lime is 
sprayed onto the surface of the soil formation, whereupon the 

topmost layer of the soil formation, provided with cement and, 
if necessary, with lime, is intermixed, graded and 

consolidated. 
A method according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the moisture content of the ground in the region of 

the broken-up soil formation is continuously measured and the 
quantity of water to be added is automatically regulated in 

dependence thereon. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that a film made of a plastics material is laid on the 

consolidated protective layer and the cleaned ballast is  
 

discharged onto the film. 
A machine for creating a formation protective layer of a 
track, comprising an excavating chain (15) [sic, recte 5]
 for 
taking up the ballast underneath the track, conveyor units for 

discharging the ballast, and devices (32;15,16) for conveying 
additional materials and intermixing them with the soil 

formation, for implementing a method according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that, between the excavating 

chain (5) and the mixing elements (40) of the mixing device 
(15,16), openings (31) of a supply line (32) which are located 

underneath the track are provided for conveying the additional 
materials onto the soil formation. 
A machine according to claim 6, characterised in that, 
immediately preceding the mixing device (15,16) in the working 

direction, a number of ripper teeth (29) are provided which 
are located side by side in the transverse direction of the 

machine, are vertically adjustable by means of drives (28) for 
positioning underneath the track (7), and are mounted on a 

machine frame (4). 
A machine according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that the ripper teeth (29) are fixed on a supporting frame 

(24) of the mixing device (15,16). 
A machine according to one of claims 6, 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the mixing elements (40) are mounted on 

a horizontal swivelling arm (34) so as to be rotatable by 
means of a drive (41) around a vertical axis (42), the end of 

the said swivelling arm opposite the mixing elements being 
fixed to the supporting frame (24) of the mixing device 

(15,16) so as to be pivotable around a vertical axis (35) by 
means of a drive (36). 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that each of the ripper teeth (29) has a duct  

 
(30) provided with each opening (31), for conveying an 

additional substance therethrough, the said duct being 
connected via the flexible line (32) to a supply line (33) 

fixed to the machine frame (4). 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterised in that the mixing device (15,16) has spray 

nozzles (37), arranged one after another on the swivelling arm 
(34) in the longitudinal direction thereof, which are 

connected by a flexible line (38) to a supply line (39) fixed 
to the machine frame (4). 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterised in that a mixing device (15,16) is provided on 

each longitudinal side of the machine and is connected by 
means of a parallelogram linkage (25) to a supporting body 

(26) which is mounted on the machine frame (4) so as to be 
rotatable around a vertical axis by means of a drive (27). 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 12, 
characterised in that, following the mixing device (15,16) and 

preceding the ballast discharge point in the working 
direction, a consolidating device (17) is provided which is 

vertically adjustable by means of drives (47) for positioning 
underneath the track (7) and is equipped with a horizontal 

consolidator plate (43) which extends approximately in the 
transverse direction of the track. 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 13, 
characterised in that the consolidator plate (43) comprises 

two parts (44,45), each arranged via a parallelogram linkage 
(46) on one longitudinal side of the machine frame (4), the 

said two parts being detachably joined together. 
A machine according to one of claims 6 to 14, 
characterised in that a holder (48) which is connected to the 

consolidating device (17) and located following the  
 

consolidator plate (43) in the working direction of the 
machine is provided for supporting a roll of film (49) 

extending over the whole width of the formation and containing 
the plastic film (50), the axis of rotation (51) of the roll 

of film (49) extending substantially parallel to the surface
