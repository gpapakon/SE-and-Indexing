<ABSTRACT>
This system is available to join the internal 
electrical elements, being used in electrical and 

vitroceramic plates to connect the regulators/switches 
of the controls reciprocally and the lights indicating 

the existence of residual heat in the heaters. This 
connection is therefore performed through some 

connectors coupled in the terminals of the regulators/ 
switches and the support of the above-mentioned lights, 

being that support joined to the connector (1) supplied 
with some cavities (2) where the terminals of the 

conductor cables are inserted. 
The connector (5) that is joined to the 
regulators/switches of the device controls has a 

support (13) to which a hinged cover (6) is fitted. 
Besides, it also has some cavities (9) to fit the 

terminals of the cables, being these ones located in 
some grooves (11) related to the cavities (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention, as stated in the heading of
this descriptive memory, consists of a connector system
for cooking devices, available to join the internal
electrical elements, being used in electrical plates
and, mainly, in vitroceramic plates, in the connection
of the regulators/switches of the controls
reciprocally, and with the lights indicating the
existence of residual heat in the heaters.So, the connection to the regulators and the support
of the lights indicating the existence of residual heat
in the heaters is performed through some connectors
with a variable number of tracks respectively, being
that connection carried out by a simple coupling of the
connectors in the respective terminals.In this way, the connections should be made by fitting
the connectors in relation to the terminals of the
regulators and the support of the lights indicating
residual heat in the heaters, just by pressing them
easily and quickly, thus simplifying the
industrialization and with an important rationalisation
of the process, all of it representing a significant
economic saving, with no need of so much time to carry
out that operation.In the same way, what matters is to avoid completely
any intervention of the after-sales service because of
a mismatched terminal, which may cause in the future
overheatings and failures in the internal components.Also, there is a reduction of the useful volume of its
metallic frame, which makes its adjustment to all kind
of kitchen furniture easy.Finally, this system guarantees a connection of total
reliability, thus avoiding possible mismatches in the
assembly and future breakdowns.A cable connecting arrangement for an electrical cooking plate
is disclosed in EP-A-0 304 906.The support on which the lights indicating residual
heat are assembled in the different heaters of the
vitroceramic plates has a number of tabs, on which are
connected the terminals of the ends of the conductor 
cables, joining them with different elements of the
plate, such as the regulators/switches, being in the
same way supplied with some tabs on which are connected
the terminals of the ends of the respective conductor
cables that carry out the connection among all the
elements in the plate for its perfect operation.In order to provide the appropriate connection of all
the elements in the plate reciprocally, the cables show
different colours and the joining of the terminal of
the end of the conductor cables with the tabs of the
different elements is carried out using an appropiated
tool. This operation
