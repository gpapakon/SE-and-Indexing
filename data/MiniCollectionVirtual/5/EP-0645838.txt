<ABSTRACT>
A non-contact rotating coupler for transmitting 
a signal through coupling capacitances (C2, C3) 

formed between opposite coupling plates (10, 20) 
arranged apart from each other. In the coupling plates 

(10, 20), an inductance (L1, L2) for causing a parallel 
resonance in a signal frequency band with a stray 

capacity (CS1, CS2) existing between a grounded 
conductor (13, 23) and a non-grounded conductor (12, 22) 

is connected between a junction point of a resistor (R1, 
R2) and a capacitor (C1, C4) and the grounded conductor 

(13, 23) or between the non-grounded conductor (12, 22) 
and the grounded conductor (13, 23), thereby reducing a 

coupling loss.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-contact 
rotating coupler used in an antenna device such as an 
antenna for reception of satellite broadcasting, and 
more particularly to a non-contact rotating coupler in 
which a reduction in coupling loss is contemplated. Recently, there has rapidly been developed an 
antenna for reception of satellite broadcasting which is 
to be mounted to a moving body such as sightseeing bus, 
personal vehicle and RV (recreational vehicle). In this 
kind of vehicle-mounted antenna, the direction of a 
broadcasting satellite (BS) seen from the antenna 
changes momently with a change in route of the vehicle 
or the like. Therefore, it becomes necessary to perform 
a tracking operation for controlling the azimuth angle 
and the elevation angle of the antenna so that the 
antenna is always directed to the broadcasting 
satellite. As a result, it is required that a rotating 
coupler for allowing the antenna to make a relative 
rotation while maintaining the electrical coupling of a 
signal frequency band should be provided in the course 
of a feeder line which connects the antenna and a tuner. 
Such a rotating coupler may include a high frequency  
 
type rotating coupler which is provided between a 
rotating antenna and a stationary converter in order to 
couple a receive signal having a frequency in the 
vicinity of 12 GHz. In another type of rotating 
coupler, an antenna and a converter are integrated with 
each other and a receive signal having a frequency in 
the vicinity of 12 GHz is converted once by the 
converter into an intermediate frequency signal having a 
frequency in order of 1 GHz. This type of rotating 
coupler or a low frequency type rotating coupler is 
provided in the course of a transmission path of the 
intermediate frequency signal. Both the types of 
rotating couplers have their merits and demerits. But, 
the low frequency type rotating coupler is regarded as 
being advantageous from the aspect of electrical 
characteristics such as S/N ratio and frequency 
characteristic. The low frequency type rotating coupler as 
mentioned above has a structure shown in Figs. 4A and 
4B. As shown in Fig. 4A, a coupling plate 30 includes 
an insulating plate 31, a non-grounded (or hot side) 
conductor plate 32 formed on one of opposite surfaces of 
the insulating plate 31, a grounded conductor plate 33 
formed on the other surface thereof, and a series 
connection of an impedance matching resistor R1 and a DC 
blocking capacitor C1 provided between the non-grounded 
cond
