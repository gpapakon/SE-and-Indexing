<ABSTRACT>
A split sprocket (12) and retainer assembly 
(10) are provided for mounting on the drive shaft (S) 

of a chain drive system, such as a conveyor drive 
system. The sprocket (12) is split diametrically into 

two sections (14) and includes a hub (28). Cross 
fixing bolts (44) across the hub secure the two 

sprocket sections together on the drive shaft. A one-piece 
retaining ring (16) is positioned over the 

sprocket hub (28) in snug engagement, and overlying the 
bolts. The retaining ring absorbs the thrust force 

generated by the driving torque tending to radially 
separate the sprocket sections during operation of the 

drive system. A split outer retainer collar (18) is 
mounted so as to abut the retaining ring and to secure 

it in position against axial shifting and backing off 
the hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
rotary drive systems for machinery and, more
particularly, to an improved split sprocket and
retainer assembly for heavy equipment, such as an
armored face conveyor.Sprockets are an integral component of many
heavy-duty equipment and machinery drive systems
including those of conveyors, such as armored face
conveyors and beam stage loaders used in underground
mining of coal. By definition, such sprockets include
a series of spaced teeth for engaging the sequential
horizontal links of a chain being driven. Most often
in this specific application, the sprocket accommodates
dual, side-by-side chains. Each chain is captured
between two contoured inside surfaces forming the teeth
of the driving interface.While such a rotary drive system has proven
to be efficient and effective for this purpose, rapid
wear of the teeth can be a serious problem. This wear
primarily results from the harsh operating environment
of mining equipment. Heavy loading, relatively high
operating speeds and the presence of particulate
matter, including coal fines, sand and small rock
particles, trapped at the driving interface between the 
sprocket teeth and chain, causes the accelerated wear.In order to facilitate repair/replacement of
a worn or damaged sprocket, it has long been known to
utilize a sprocket of split design. Such sprockets are
typically split diametrically into two sections. This
facilitates removal from the drive shaft, and
replacement with a new sprocket. The split
configuration of the sprocket eliminates the need to
free one end of the drive shaft from the bearings for
slipping the sprocket on and off over the end of the
shaft. An example of such a split sprocket design is
shown in, for example, the U.S. patent 4,037,713 to
Soliman et al. Another known arrangement is where a
split retainer assembly is used, such as shown in the
U.S. patent 3,685,367 to Dawson. However, in this
instance releasable stub shafts, or other arrangements
must be made to remove the sprocket.In these patents, the split sprocket or
collar sections are retained on the drive shaft solely
by means of cross fixing bolts mounted in the typical
pattern transverse to the shaft axis. While such a
fastening mechanism allows for proper and dependable
operation for many light to medium duty applications,
it leaves much to be desired insofar as providing the
necessary strength to handle the torque generated
radial thrust loads that may be anticipated to occur
during certain heavy duty conveyor applications, or

A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) for mounting on a drive shaft (S)
of a rotary drive unit (U), comprising:


a driving member (12) including a hub (28) and being split substantially diametrically
into two sections (14);
means for connecting said hub (28) of the driving member to said shaft (S);
a one-piece retaining ring (16) adapted to be positioned over the end of said hub (28)
to join said sections (14) when mounted on said shaft (S), said one-piece retaining ring

absorbing thrust forces tending to radially separate said sections during operation of said drive
unit (U); and
an outer retainer collar (18) mounted on said shaft (S) so as to axially abut said
one-piece retaining ring (16) to prevent said ring from shifting axially along said hub (28) and

said drive shaft; 
characterised in that
means (22) are provided for positive fixing said sections (14) together on opposite sides
of said shaft (S); said outer retainer collar (18) is split substantially diametrically into two

segments (20); and
releasable means (44) are provided for connecting said retainer collar (18) to said shaft;
and
said retaining ring (16) is axially displaceable to a position in which it engages said hub
(28) and said collar (18) can be radially assembled out of its two segments (20) around the drive

shaft in the space which is vacated by the axial displacement of said ring (16) into its hub-engaging
position; 
whereby said split driving member (12) is securely retained and connected to said shaft
(S) during operation, but easily removable for replacement.
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in Claim 1, wherein said
hub (28) further includes a tapered seat (30) and a locating shoulder (32) for receiving and

engaging said one-piece retaining ring (16).
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein said one-piece retaining ring (16) is substantially L-shaped in cross section including

an annular flange (34) extending over the end of said hub (28) and said cross-fixing means in
a plane substantially transverse to the axis of said drive shaft (S).
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in any preceding Claim,
wherein said outer retainer collar (18) includes an annular recess (38), and a shoulder (40) on

the drive shaft (S) engages said recess to thereby resist axial displacement along said drive shaft.
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) as set forth in any preceding Claim,
wherein said rotary drive unit (U) is a drive sprocket (12) with teeth (26) to engage a drive chain

(C), for an armoured face conveyor or the like.
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in any preceding Claim,
wherein said retaining ring (16) is a press fit onto tapered seat (30) of said hub (28).
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in any preceding Claim,
wherein said hub (28) includes two ends mounted on said drive shaft (S);

   and wherein said retainer assembly (10) includes a one-piece retaining ring (16) and an
outer retainer collar (18) on each end of said hub (28).
A driving member (12) and retainer assembly (10) set forth in Claim 5 and any Claim
appendant thereto, wherein said member (12) includes spaced teeth (26) for driving dual chains
