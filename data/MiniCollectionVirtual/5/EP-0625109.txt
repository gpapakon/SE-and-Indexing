<ABSTRACT>
A brake device (10) has a housing of which the two parts (11, 15) are releasably connected together by bolts (25). Co-operating pressure fluid passages in the two housing parts communicate pressure fluid from a source to actuators within the housing, and include separable plug and socket connectors (30, 31) located on the respective housing parts so that separation of the parts effects disconnection of the actuators from the pressure fluid source. A non-return valve is arranged to close on separation of the housing parts and to be opened again by the plug connector. An electrical connection to an electrically powered cooling fan can be similarly broken when the housing parts are separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid operated brake devices, 
such as are employed industrially for example in papermaking 
and related fields. Such brake devices typically comprise a brake disc 
secured to a rotatable shaft which is to be braked and 
against which brake pads are selectively engaged by 
pneumatically powered actuators. For protection, operative 
parts of such a device are enclosed in a housing which must 
allow convenient access to the operative parts for servicing. 
The invention is accordingly concerned with the provision of 
a fluid-operated brake device having a housing which 
facilitates safe and convenient servicing of the device. Thus from EP-A-0 219 938 there is known a brake device 
of the kind having fluid-operated actuator means for applying 
a braking force, the brake device comprising a housing having 
first and second parts which are relatively displaceable from 
a closed position to permit access to at least a part of the 
housing interior, a pressure fluid connection element at the 
housing exterior for connection with a source of pressure 
fluid, and passage means communicating the pressure fluid 
connection element with the actuator means. In accordance with the invention there is provided a 
brake device of this kind in which the passage means are in 
the first and second housing parts and include separable co-operating 
connectors located on the first and second housing 
parts respectively so that displacement of the housing parts 
effects disconnection of the actuator means from the pressure 
fluid source. A non-return valve upstream of the air supply connection 
between the two housing parts, and arranged to be held open 
when the parts are assembled, can be provided. Considerable heat can be qenerated frictionally within  
 
the housing of a fluid operated brake device and an electric 
cooling fan can be incorporated in the housing. In this 
event, the electric power supply can be carried through the  
 
separable housing parts in a similar way so that access to 
the fan cannot be obtained without its being isolated from 
its power supply. The invention is further described below, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a brake device, 
including a two-part housing, in accordance with the 
invention; Figure 2 is a sectional side view of the brake device of 
Figure 1; and Figures 3 & 4 are partial perspective views, from 
different viewpoints, of connector portions of the two parts 
of the brake

<CLAIMS>
A brake device having fluid-operated actuator means 
for applying a brake force, the brake device (10) comprising a 

housing having first (11) and second (15) parts which are relatively 
displaceable from a closed position to permit access to at 

least a part of the housing interior, a pressure fluid 
connection element (30) at the housing exterior for connection 

with a source of pressure fluid, and passage means 
communicating the pressure fluid connection element (30) with the 

actuator means, characterised in that the passage means are 
in the first (11) and second (15) housing parts and include separable 

co-operating connectors (12, 16) located on the first (11) and second (15) 
housing parts respectively so that displacement of the 

housing parts (11, 15) effects disconnection of the actuator means 
from the pressure fluid source. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
passage means include a non-return valve between the 

connection element (30) and the co-operating connectors (12, 16), the non-return 
valve being arranged to close on the displacement of 

the housing parts (11, 15) and to be opened on return of the parts (11, 15) to 
the closed position. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 2 wherein the co-operating 
connectors (12, 16) comprise a plug (39) and a socket (37) connector, 

and wherein the plug connector (39) engages the non-return valve 
in the closed position of the housing parts (11, 15) to open the 

valve. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the 
valve comprises a spring-biassed valve member and the plug 

connector (39) engages the valve member to move it to the open 
position against the spring bias. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 
wherein the first housing part (11) is arranged to be permanently 

mounted and the second housing (15) part mounts the actuator means 
and is displaceable from the first housing part (11). 
A brake device as claimed in claim 5 wherein the co-operating  
 

connectors (12, 16) are located at respective faces of the 
first (11) and second (15) parts which are juxtaposed in the closed 

position. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein 
the connection element (30) is located on the first housing part (11). 
A brake device as claimed in claim 7 wherein the 
connection element (30) is located at a face of the first housing 

part (11) extending transversely to the juxtaposed faces. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 5, 6, 7 or 8 
wherein the displacement of the housing parts (11, 15) comprises 

separation of the second housing part (15) from the first part (11). 
A brake device as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the housing parts (11, 15) comprise respective juxtaposed 

portions having the connection element (30) and the co-operating 
connectors (12, 16), the juxtaposed portions projecting outwardly from 

the main portions of the parts (11, 15). 
A brake device as claimed in any preceding claim 
having an electrically powered cooling fan (20), an electric power 

supply connection element (31) at the exterior of the housing for

means in the first (11) and second (15) housing parts communicating the 
electric connection element 
with the fan (20), and separable co-operating 
contacts included in the conductor means and 

located on the first (11) and second (15) housing parts respectively so 
that the displacement of the housing parts (11, 15) effects 

disconnection of the fan (20) from the electric power supply 
source. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 11 wherein the 
co-operating contacts are located adjacent and spaced from 

the co-operating connectors (12, 16).
