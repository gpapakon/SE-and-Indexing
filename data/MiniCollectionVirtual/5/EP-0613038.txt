<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display substrate and device and a method of manufacturing
them, and more specifically to a liquid crystal display
substrate incorporating thin-film transistors, which serve
as switching elements, a method of manufacture thereof, and
the corresponding display devices.A so-called active matrix type liquid crystal display
substrate has nonlinear elements (switching elements)
provided in one-to-one correspondence to a plurality of
pixel electrodes arranged in the form of matrix. The
liquid crystal at each pixel is theoretically driven at
all times (duty ratio of 1.0), so that the active type has
better contrast than a so-called simple matrix type that
adopts a time-division driving method. The active matrix
type liquid crystal display substrate is becoming an
essential technology particularly for color liquid crystal
display devices. A representative switching element is a
thin-film transistor (TFT).The thin-film transistor consists of: a gate, a gate
insulating film and a silicon layer such as an amorphous
silicon (a-Si) layer or polysilicon (p-Si) layer, all
formed successively on the surface of a transparent 
substrate in which pixel electrodes are formed; and a
drain electrode and a source electrode, both deposited on
the silicon layer and formed integral with an interconnect
layer or busline that supplies voltage and also with pixel
electrodes.The liquid crystal display substrate of the active
matrix type using the thin-film transistors is known and
introduced in such publications as Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 309921/1988 and an article entitled
"12.5-type Active Matrix Color Liquid Crystal Display
Using Redundant Configuration" in Nikkei Electronics, page
193-210, December 15, 1986, published by Nikkei
McGraw-Hill. A liquid crystal display substrate having the features of the preamble of claim 1 to disclosed by US-A-5 068 699.The thin-film transistor of the above configuration
used in the liquid crystal display substrate, however, has
a problem that because the gate, the gate insulating film
and the silicon layer are produced separately in specified
patterns by using the known photoetching technique, a
number of manufacturing processes are required.The present invention has been accomplished against
this background. It is the object of the invention to
provide liquid crystal display substrates and corresponding
display devices which can be manufactured with a
substantially reduced number of manufacturing steps, and a
method for manufacturing them.
