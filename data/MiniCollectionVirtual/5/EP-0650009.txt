<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lighting device intended to be fixed to a wall. It is characterised in that it comprises a tubular structure intended to be fixed to the wall and equipped at one of its ends with a light fitting (1). This structure, used for guiding an electrical supply cable (4) is produced in at least two parts (2,3) following each other and connected to each other by an intermediate casing formed by two half-shells (10,13), each belonging to one part of the structure. These two half-shells (10,13) can be assembled together reversibly. The intermediate casing contains a means for controlling the current supply (16) of the light fitting (1).
