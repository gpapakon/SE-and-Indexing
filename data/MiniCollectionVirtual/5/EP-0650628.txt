<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic transducer (10) formed as a composite of three different materials for reproducing and/or recording signals with a magnetic medium, the transducer including first and second generally identical sections (12, 12'), which, when bonded together in opposing relation, form a transducer having aligned recesses (13, 13') in the outer edges and a formed winding window opening (19, 19') adjacent the pole tips, the window being arranged for receiving coil turns therethrough for providing the coil (32) on a line generally parallel to the tape contact surface of the transducer (10), the core legs (18, 18') being formed of two strips of Alfesil material, or the like, deposited or sputtered on the substrate. Each core section (12, 12') is formed as a portion of an elongate ferrite block substrate (20) with a thin cap of non-magnetic material (16, 16'), initially shaped to provide opposing elongate bonding notches (26, 28) on opposite edges of a common surface (22), and an intermediate winding groove (19b) in proximate relation to one of the notches. The winding groove preferably protrudes into the non-magnetic material to about half its depth. Thereafter the workpiece is provided with an array or a plurality of equally spaced V-shaped track width defining grooves (40a-40j) oriented in a direction perpendicular to the winding groove (19b), with the grooves defining pole edges having tapered side surfaces. A chrome adhesion layer is deposited on the grooved surface and into the winding groove, followed by a core layer of suitable magnetic material, such as Alfesil material which provides a pole material covering the edges as well as the tapered side surfaces. A chrome adhesion layer is applied to the Alfesil layer, followed by a gap layer of insulating material. Two of such workpieces (20, 20') are then placed with the edges in facing opposing aligned abutting relation and glass bonding is effected by means of the two bonding notches (26, 28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to magnetic head transducers and more particularly 
to a metal and ferrite composite magnetic video head transducer using sputtered strips for 
forming the core legs thereof. The performance of a magnetic tape data recorder depends heavily on the properties 
of the magnetic materials used to make the recording heads and tapes and on the structural 
configuration of these materials which influence their magnetic properties. Magnetically 
hard materials, characterized by their high remanence, high coercivity, and low permeability, 
are chiefly used in the manufacturing of the recording tape and other related recording media. 
On the other hand, magnetically soft materials, which exhibit low coercivity, low 
remanence, and relatively high permeability, are commonly utilized to make the magnetic 
cores for the heads which are the means by which electrical signals are recorded on and 
reproduced from the magnetic tape. The typical ring-type magnetic head is composed of two highly permeable magnetic 
cores, with anon-magnetic gap spacer and a coil to which signal information is connected. 
The record head is a transducer that changes the electrical energy from the signal system into 
a magnetic field that is emitted from a physical gap in the head which impresses a magnetic 
pattern on the magnetic tape proportional to the electrical signal. The reproduce head, 
conversely, is a transducer that collects the flux from the magnetic tape across a physical gap 
and changes it into an electrical signal that is proportional to the recorded flux. Ferrite materials have been conventionally used as the magnetic material in video 
heads. The advent of high-definition video tape recorders, digital video tape recorders, 
computer digital data storage devices and the like, with the resultant use of high coercivity 
recording media such as metal powder media, metal evaporated media etc., have accelerated 
the trend towards high density construction for recording even larger amounts of 
information. As part of this evolution, there is the resultant need to increase the density of 
the information signal recorded on the medium. Conventional ferrite cores have significant 
limitations in providing the desired characteristics to achieve the required performance for 
these applications.  
 There are performance problems with ferrite heads, particularly when such heads are 
used with high coercivity magnetic tape, and particularly during the recording process. 
During recording, larger signals

A ring-type magnetic transducer for reproducing and/or 
recording high frequency magnetic signals via tracks in a 

magnetic medium and including a pair of abutting core 
sections (12,12'), each of said sections being formed of a 

respective magnetic substrate (15,15') bonded to a 
respective non-magnetic cap (16,16') and having facing edges 

(19) formed on said magnetic substrate and said non-magnetic 
caps, a non-magnetic transducing gap being disposed between 

said facing edges of the caps, the non-magnetic caps 
presenting a medium-bearing surface (24) extending generally 

transverse to said facing edges, each core section (12,12')

including a winding window (19b) and also including a raised 
land (19a), said one edge and the raised land generally 

being in register with said transducing gap, whereby the

generally the width of the tracks; and coil means (32) 
extending through said window and about the magnetic 

substrate in generally parallel relation with said surface;
