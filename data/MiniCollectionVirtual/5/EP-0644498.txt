<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the location of weld 
preparations for a replacement component of a piping 

system. The method includes the use of a tracking laser 
interferometer to obtain measurements of the existing 

piping system as well as of the replacement component, and 
the use of the interferometer to generate a corresponding 

data file. The data file is downloaded to a CAD system 
which facilitates the identification of weld prep locations 

which result in minimizing the amount of machining required 
while maximizing the resulting pipe wall thickness. The 

tracking laser interferometer is also used to position the 
machining equipment on the nozzles and pipe ends. This 

method provides for rapid response to field changes, such 
as unexpected pipe movements or machining errors, and it 

provides the plant owner with a high level of assurance 
that the replacement component will fit properly, prior to 

any actual machining operations or heavy lifts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The replacement of components such as tanks and 
heat exchangers in existing piping systems is commonplace 
in many industries. When the component is small and the 
working environment is benign, the fit of the replacement 
component can be accomplished by trial and error after the 
removal of the retired component from the system. However, 
when the component is large and/or the working environment 
is hazardous, it is important for the replacement component 
to fit into place without significant error. One of the more difficult component replacement 
tasks accomplished to date is the replacement of the steam 
generators in a nuclear power plant. Not only are the 
components involved massive and the working spaces cramped, 
but also the work area and existing components are highly 
radioactive. It is important to be able to prepare the 
weld preps on the replacement steam generator nozzles and 
the reactor coolant system pipe ends with precision so that 
there are no component handling or fit-up problems during 
the replacement process. Mechanical templates have been used successfully 
on steam generator replacement projects. This method 
involves the construction of a mechanical template which 
represents the replacement steam generator. The template 
is then moved into position after the retired steam generator  
 
is removed from the plant, and it is used to mechanically 
determine the desired location of the weld preps. 
This method has many disadvantages, including the cost of 
the mechanical template, and the time and radiation exposure 
required to move the template into position. Furthermore, 
difficulties with the fit-up are not identified until 
after the retired steam generator is removed. With this 
type of system, the equipment used to machine the weld prep 
is typically positioned by measuring the position of the 
equipment in relation to a series of marks made of the 
nozzle or pipe. Computer aided design (CAD) software is known in 
the art and has been used to model steam generators for a 
variety of purposes. Figure 1 is a CAD generated model of 
the channel head portion of a typical nuclear steam generator, 
showing the inlet and outlet nozzles and three support 
pad locations. To obtain the as-built dimensions of the existing 
piping and the replacement steam generators, it is known to 
use theodolites. These optical instruments require an 
operator at each of two instruments, which for a nuclear 
application is within the radioactive environment. However, 
the use of the theodolite
