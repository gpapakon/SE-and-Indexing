<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling a feed-forward compensated power amplifier system is disclosed which uses a spread spectrum technique to cover a control signal or signals and injects a composite signal at a suitable point into the feed-forward amplifier system to reduce distortion. The amount of bandwidth spread is governed by the amount of processing gain needed in the remapping process and the needed time response of the system. Control signals after remapping of the spread spectrum at the output of the system are correlated in a match filter correlator and the result is used to control, in either polar or cartesian coordinates, the injection, in anti-phase, of the extracted distortion into the feed-forward amplifier output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention as it is defined in the appended claims relates to high
powered linear amplifiers and in particular to a new control system using spread
spectrum and feed forward techniques for the reduction of
distortion introduced by high powered amplifiers.It is well known in the art that all amplifiers distort an
inputted signal. The distortion becomes greater as the power
levels are increased. When amplifier compression and group
delay distortion is introduced into a single information
carrying channel, or when the amplifier is exposed to multiple
input signals, intermodulation (IM) products are introduced.
These IM products must be kept low because they interfere with
the system or with other users. Methods have therefore been
developed to reduce these types of distortion.There are two types of distortion introduced by an amplifier.
The first type of distortion, referred to as linear distortion,
is related to the frequency dependent gain and phase
response of the amplifier. The phase response is not the
absolute phase value, but rather the part differing from the
linear phase, i.e, the time delay in the amplifier. The
second type of distortion, referred to as non-linear distortion,
is produced by the non-linear gain-to-input power in the
amplifier. The linear part of the distortion plays a significant
role in wide band applications.The distortion caused by single carrier power amplifiers can
be dealt with by using feedback techniques such as cartesian
feedback. The main drawback with using feedback is the narrow 
bandwidth within which the distortion can be reduced because
of stability constraints.The wideband amplifier is becoming more attractive as a
carrier power amplifier because of the improved systems
flexibility it offers over ordinary multiple single carrier
power amplifiers using passive filter combination techniques
at their outputs. In wideband systems, there are two main
methods for dealing with distortion: predistortion; and feed-forward.
Predistortion means that the non-linear and/or the
linear part of the distortion introduced by the main amplifier
is inversely modeled at the input of the amplifier, thereby
making the total, ideally, equal to a frequency independent
constant. To reduce the linear distortion, a simple filter is
needed; and to reduce the non-linear distortion, a "curve
bender" needs to be used. However, both methods have to be
adapted to overcome aging, temperature and sample differences.The feed-forward technique consists basically of two independent
steps. The
