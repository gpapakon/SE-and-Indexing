<ABSTRACT>
A replaceable ink container or bottle (1) is disclosed for an ink jet printing apparatus in which the mouth of the bottle is closed by a puncturable diaphragm (19). A puncturing member (35) carried by the ink reservoir (21) of the ink jet printing apparatus pierces through the diaphragm upon the container being installed in the ink jet printing apparatus. Upon the puncturing member (35) puncturing through the diaphragm (19), the diaphragm sealingly engages the sides of the puncturing tube so as to substantially prevent the ink from leaking therepast, and the puncturing tube opens communication between the ink within the container and the ink reservoir thereby permitting ink to flow from the bottle into the ink reservoir via the puncturing member. An air path (37) is provided which is in communication with the atmosphere and with the reservoir so that ink from within the container and atmospheric air may be exchanged via the puncturing member so that ink is free to flow from the container into the reservoir, and so that the pressure within the container is maintained substantially at atmospheric pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Ink Bottle with Puncturable Diaphragm ClosureThis invention relates to an ink bottle (or other container) for containing a supply of ink foran ink jet printing system. The ink jet printing apparatus for which the ink bottle of the present invention is intended for use is generally referred to as an industrial type ink jet printing system (asopposed to an office ink jet printer) which typically is used to print indicia on packaging or on secondary packaging of products conveyed past the ink jet printhead of this system as the products in their packages are conveyed past the printhead on a conveyor belt or the like. Such ink jet printing systems are shown in U. S. Patent Application No. 08/728,774 filed October 11, 1996, assigned to Marsh Company of Belleville, Illinois. It will be appreciated that such industrial ink jet printing systems typically use considerably more ink in a given time than office ink jet printers because the area printed by such industrial printers is greater and the industrial printing systems operate continuously. Thus, it is desirable to provide a relatively large supply of ink for such industrial ink jet printers, as compared to office ink jet printers. Heretofore, ink was supplied to such commercial ink jet printing systems by means of a disposable ink bottle holding a desired quantity of ink (e.g., a pint or a litre). One such ink bottle is shown in U. S. Patent 5,343,226 entitled "Ink Jet Ink Supply Apparatus," which has a spring biased poppet valve incorporated in a screw on cap such that when the bottle is inverted and threaded into a receptacle in the ink jet printing apparatus, a finger will engage the normally closed spring biased valve in the cap, and will force the valve to open, thus allowing ink from within the bottle to fill a reservoir of the ink jet printing apparatus. Upon removal of the ink bottle from theink jet printing apparatus, the valve will close under the bias of the spring, and thus the valve will prevent the flow of ink from the bottle as it is removed. While such bottles worked well for their intended purpose, the necessity of including the spring biased valve in the cap of each bottle is expensive. 

 Reference also may be made to U. S. Patents 4,531,656 and 4,678,101 which disclose the use of a puncturable closure for a bottle from which a liquid is to be pressure dispensed.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an ink jet printingapparatus comprising: an ink reservoir; a replaceable ink container for supplying ink to
