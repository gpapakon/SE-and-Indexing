<ABSTRACT>
Device for the visual recognition of authenticity characteristics of banknotes and papers of value, which has an overall elongate rod-shaped basic form. Its rear section (11) is constructed as a handle having a battery compartment. Connected thereto are, in the manner of a finger projecting towards the front, a lower part (4) having a diffusing screen (3) which can be illuminated by means of an illuminating device and an upper part (12) having an optical element (2) which is constructed as a rod-shaped lens or the like and to which an ultraviolet illuminating device is assigned. The upper and the lower part form between themselves a test gap (10) for receiving the object to be tested.
