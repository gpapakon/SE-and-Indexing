<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an amusement machine. DE-U-8 629 981 discloses an amusement machine having the 
features in the preamble of claim 1. The pick-up 
mechanism in this document is a three pronged gripper 
suspended by a cable from moveable overhead crane. GB-A-2 223 179 discloses an amusement machine comprising 
a play area for containing a plurality of small portable 
articles which are accessible from above and a gripping 
means remotely operable by a user of the machine for 
gripping articles in the play area and transferring them 
to a collection station. The gripping means is mounted 
on the end of an articulated arm comprising a rotatable 
member and proximal and distal arm members successively 
articulated to the rotatable member. According to the invention, there is provided an amusement 
machine as defined in Claim 1. In addition, the amusement machine preferably comprises 
some or all of the following further features. The small 
portable articles are balls, for example made of plastic (e.g. 
nylon) or metal. A collector chute is provided close to the 
play area for receiving balls from the scoop means, and a 
continuously moving conveyor system receives the balls from the 
collector chute and transports them into a collector hopper 
which constitutes the collection station. The machine is preferably coin- or counter-operated. On 
insertion of a coin, the user is able to operate the scoop 
means for a fixed time. The prize dispensed is then in 
proportion to the number of balls collected at the collection 
station in the fixed time, and the number of balls collected is 
measured by the sensor means. Instead of dispensing a prize 
immediately, the user may gain a "credit" which counts towards 
a more valuable prize on further use of the machine. After 
each time of use has expired, balls which have collected at the 
collecting station are returned to the play area. In one embodiment, the prize is a small article enclosed 
in a spherical capsule (hereinafter called a prize capsule) and 
is dispensed into the play area, from which the user of the  
 
machine may retrieve it by use of the scoop means. The prize 
capsule will preferably be of larger diameter than the regular 
small balls, so that it can be distinguished from them by the 
machine mechanism. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figures 1A, 1B and 1C respectively show a front view, side 
view and rear view of a machine according to a preferred 
embodiment of the invention; Figures 2A, 2B and 2C

<CLAIMS>
An amusement machine comprising a play area (3) 
for containing a plurality of small portable articles (30) 

which are accessible from above; scoop means (4) remotely 
operable by a user of the machine for scooping articles 

from the play area (3) and transferring them directly or 
indirectly to a collection station (7); sensor means (26) 

for detecting the amount of articles at the collection 
station (7); and dispensing means for dispensing a cash 

or non-cash prize in response to a signal from the sensor 
means (26), characterised in that the scoop means (4) 

comprises a rotatable member (17), proximal and distal 
arm members (18,19) successively articulated to the 

rotatable member (17), and a scoop (20) articulated to an 
end of the distal arm member (19), to permit pivoting of 

the scoop (20) in one direction for picking up a 
plurality of articles (30) and in an opposite direction 

for emptying said articles (30) at the collection station 
(7). 
An amusement machine according to claim 1, in 
which the small portable articles are balls (30). 
An amusement machine according to claim 2, 
having a collector chute (5) close to the play area (3) 

for receiving balls (30) from the scoop means (4), and 
a conveyor system (6) for receiving balls from the 

collector chute (5) and transporting them into a 
collector hopper (7) which constitutes the collection 

station. 
An amusement machine according to claim 2 or 
3, in which the prize is enclosed in a spherical capsule 

(31) and is dispensed into the play area (3), from which 
it may be retrieved by use of the scoop means (4).
