<ABSTRACT>
A data storage system comprises a matrix of intelligent storage 
nodes interconnected to communicate with each other via a network of 

busses (R
o
-R
m
,C
o
-C
n
). The network of busses includes a plurality of 
first busses (R
o
-R
m
) for conducting data from and to a corresponding 
plurality of host system processors (H
o
-H
m
) and a plurality of second 
busses (C
o
-C
n
), each one of the second busses intersecting with each 
one of the first busses. The nodes are located at each intersection. 

The storage nodes each include a data storage device (D), such as a 
magnetic disk drive unit, a processor (P) and buffer memory (B1-B3), 

whereby the node processor controls the storage and retrieval of data at 
the node as well as being capable of co-ordinating the storage and 

retrieval of data at other nodes within the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data storage systems.Disk array storage systems are known, which include a plurality of disk drives
which operate in parallel and appear to the host system as a single large disk drive.
Numerous disk array design alternatives are possible, incorporating between a few and
many disk drives. Several array alternatives, each possessing different attributes, benefits
and shortcomings, are presented in an article titled "A Case for Redundant Arrays of
Inexpensive Disks (RAID)" by David A. Patterson, Garth Gibson and Randy H. Katz;
University of California Report No. UCB/CSD 87/391, December 1987. This article
discusses disk arrays and the improvements in performance, reliability, power consumption
and scalability that disk arrays provide in comparison to single large magnetic disks. Five
different storage configurations are discussed, referred to as RAID levels 1 to 5,
respectively.Complex storage management techniques are required in order to coordinate the
operation of the multitude of data storage devices within an array to perform read and write
functions, parity generation and checking, data restoration and reconstructions, and other
necessary or optional operations. Array operation can be managed by a dedicated
hardware controller constructed to control array operations. However, the data storage
performance achievable using this technique is limited.Pages 131-136 of the report on the Eleventh IEEE Symposium on Mass Storage
Systems in Monterey, California between 7-10 October 1991 (John Wilks) makes
reference to a data storage system including a network of nodes interconnected to
communicate with each other via a plurality of buses wherein each one of the nodes
includes a data storage device connected to receive data from, and provide data to, at least
one of the plurality of buses, and also includes a node processor. However, the
arrangement of the node processor is disadvantageously limited.It is an object of the present invention to provide a data storage system which
enables a high data storage performance to be achieved.Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a data
storage system including a matrix of data storage nodes interconnected to communicate 
with each other via a plurality of busses (Ro-Rm;Co-Cn), each one of said nodes includes a
data storage device connected to receive data from and provide data to at least one of said
plurality of busses (Ro-Rm;Co-Cn) and a node processor connected to said at least one of
said busses
