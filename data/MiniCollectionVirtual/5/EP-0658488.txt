<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates especially to a bag (1) comprising at least two flexible but tearable walls (2, 3) facing one another; a border (4) for rigidly joining the two walls (2, 3) together, this border being designed to delimit, on the one hand, the external periphery (6-9) of the bag (1), and on the other hand, the external contour (10-13) of a central volume (5) designed to contain a product which is, for example, liquid, pasty, or in the form of a powder; and a line (18) of lesser strength which extends along the border (4) for joining together and which is designed to allow the bag (1) to be opened by tearing of the walls (2, 3); a first end (19) of the line of lesser strength (18) being situated at a peripheral edge (7) of the border (4) for joining together; characterised in that at its second end (20), the line of lesser strength (18) has a tangent (21) which intercepts the external contour (10, 13) of the volume (5) so that by tearing the walls (2, 3) along the line of lesser strength (18), starting from the first end (19) and via the second one (20), an opening of substantially predetermined shape is made in the volume (5).

<CLAIMS>
A sachet (1) comprising at least two flexible, but tearable walls
(2, 3) disposed facing each other; a rigid fixing margin (4) securing

the two walls (2, 3) to each other, and disposed to define both the
outer periphery of the sachet (1) and the outline (10-13) of a

central volume (5) designed to contain a substance, e.g. a liquid, a
paste, or a powder; and a line (18) of weakness which extends along

the fixing margin (4) and which is designed to enable the sachet (1)
to be opened by tearing the walls (2, 3); a first end (19) of the

line of weakness (18) being situated at a peripheral edge (7) of the
fixing margin (4); the line of weakness (18) having, at its second

end (20), a tangent (21) which intercepts the outline (10, 13) of the
volume (5),

   the sachet being characterized in that:

the line of weakness (18) has a curved portion (27) close to
its second end (20); and
the volume (5) includes, close to the second end (20), a
portion (33) projecting into the margin (4) towards one of the

peripheral edges (7) along which the line of weakness (18) extends so
that the opening (22) formed in the volume (5) by tearing constitutes

a spout.
A sachet (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that the line
of weakness (18) has a curved portion (28) close to its first end

(19).
A sachet according to claim 1, characterized in that the two
flexible walls (2, 3) are separate.
A sachet according to claim 1, characterized in that the two
flexible walls (2, 3) come from a single sheet (59) of folded

flexible material.
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the line of weakness (18) is in the form of a thinning of the

thickness of at least one wall (2, 3), a line of stamping, or a
removal of material. 
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the line of weakness (18) is interrupted between its first

and second ends (19, 20) by at least one frangible bridge (23).
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the line of weakness (18) extends along a peripheral edge (7)

of the fixing margin (4) having greatest length.
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the line of weakness (18) is substantially rectilinear (26).
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that the tangent (21) of the line of weakness (18) at its second

end (20), and a tangent (30) to the outline (10-13) of the volume (5)
at the point where the outline (10-13) intercepts the tangent (21) of

the line of weakness together define an angle (α) lying in the range
45° to 90°, and preferably of the order of 50° to 70°.
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 5 to 9, characterized
in that part of the line of weakness (18) is organized to be parallel

to the peripheral edge (7) along which it extends.
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 7 to 10,
characterized in that at its first and second ends (19, 20) the line

of weakness (18) extends respectively towards the peripheral edge (7)
of the margin (4) and towards the outline (10-13) of the volume (5),

in such a manner as to define a pull tab (25) on the margin (4).
A sachet (1) according to claim 11, characterized in that the
pull tab (25) flares, at least in part, along the line of weakness

(18) going away from the first end (19).
A sachet (11) according to claim 12, characterized in that the
pull tab (25) is flared, at least in the vicinity of the second end

(20) of the line of weakness (18). 
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 13,
characterized in that the line of weakness (18) extends along a

peripheral edge (7) which is defined in the vicinity of the first end
(19) by an adjacent peripheral edge (8), the distance between the

first end (19) and said adjacent peripheral edge (8) being greater
than the width of the fixing margin (4) when projected on the

peripheral edge (7) along which the line (18) extends, so as to leave
a retaining zone (24) on the margin (4).
A sachet (1) according to claim 14, characterized in that the
projecting portion (33) of the volume (5) is situated between the

second end (20) of the line of weakness (18) and a peripheral edge
(6) adjacent to the peripheral edge (7) along which the line of

weakness (18) extends.
A sachet (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that the peripheral edges (6-9) of the fixing margin

(4) form a polygon, preferably a rectangle.
