<ABSTRACT>
A solid state imaging apparatus includes two-dimensional 
frequency process (4,5,6,7,8) which is applied 

to an output signal from each pixel of a progressive scan-type 
CCD (3). The CCD (3) has an an arrangement of color 

separation filters (2) without making carriers in the 
horizontal and vertical directions of the two-dimensional 

frequency to obtain chrominance signals with less moire in 
the horizontal and vertical directions of the two-dimensional 

frequency. A luminance signal with less moire 
in the horizontal and vertical directions of the two-dimensional 

frequency can be obtained by interpolating with 
the ratio of a chrominance signal with less moire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid state imaging
apparatus. More specifically, this invention relates to a
solid state imaging apparatus in which each pixel receives
incident light through a color separation filter disposed on
the front of the pixel of an imaging element such as a
progressive scan-type charge coupled device (hereinafter
abbreviated as CCD).There are two types of color cameras that use an
imaging element in their image pick-up part: one is a multichip
CCD camera which uses a plurality of image elements and the
other is a single-chip CCD camera which uses a single imaging
element. The single-chip CCD camera has an arrangement of
color separation filters which corresponds to the pixels of
the CCD. The arrangement is selected to have predetermined
spectral characteristics. In the single-chip CCD, one
pixel outputs only one signal, but a plurality of
chrominance signals and a luminance signal corresponding to
one pixel can be obtained by operating a plurality of
signals from the adjacent plural pixels. Inevitably, the
single-chip CCD causes a two-dimensional sampling frequency
of each chrominance signal to become low, so that false 
signals or chrominance moires appear in the luminance
signals or the chrominance signals due to a high-pass
spectrum of an image.A conventional imaging element uses a
PD(Photodiode)-Mixing-System which sequentially reads two
signals from two pixels on two lines that adjoin each other
in the vertical direction simultaneously. The two signals
are added. A sequential chrominance system is an example of
the conventional pick-up system using the imaging element.
Fig.11 shows an arrangement of a minimum unit of color
separation filters. Such a unit is repeatedly arrayed in
the sequential chrominance system. Fig.13 shows a method
for reading the signals from the pixels of the CCD according
to the PD-Mixing-System. In Fig.13, the numeral 130 shows
the arrangement of the color separation filters and the
letters of "Mg", "G", "Ye" and "Cy" in the boxes designate
the spectral characteristics of the filters. For example, a
filter 131 designated by "Mg" can pass only magenta colored
light. On the other hand, the letters of "Mg", "G", "Ye"
and "Cy" in both sides of the arrangement of the color
separation filters 130 designate the output signals from the
pixels designated by the same letters. In the PD-Mixing-System
shown in Fig.13, Ye(yellow)+Mg(magenta),
Cy(cyanogen)+G(green) are serially output from even-number 
lines of the first field (left side of the color separation
filte
