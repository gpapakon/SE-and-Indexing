<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to electro-acoustic transducers such as is generally indicated at (10) and which comprise a body (11) defining a chamber (12), a plate (13) bearing a microphone or speaker (14) to which is attached a stalk (15), a diaphragm (16), connectable to the stalk (15), which extends substantially across the chamber (12), an end piece (17) and an end cap (18). The end piece (17) has a kidney-shaped recess (21) which provides the main communication path between subsidiary inlets/outlets (19) and a main inlet/outlet (20). When the channel (22) is closed off by the end cap (18) it is effectively in the form of a tube and constitutes a Thuras tube. The length of this path effectively creates a long discharge path between the wearer's ear and any earthable metal part within the transducer and hence protects against electric shock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electro-acoustic transducers
and particularly, but not exclusively, to such transducers
in the form of earpieces for telephone headsets and the
like and starts from US-A-4'239'945.Telephone operators often build up very substantial
static voltages on their bodies, particularly if they are
imprudent enough to wear man-made fibres. If they then plug
their headset into the telephone exchange apparatus it is
not uncommon for a spark to jump from their ear through the
acoustic inlets in the earpiece to an earthed metal portion
of the transducer. As these sparks can be derived from
several thousands of volts the sensation is at best
uncomfortable. This problem particularly arises in small
devices where the distances between the acoustic inlets and
earthable portions of transducers are normally extremely
small. Additionally, it has been found difficult to produce
economically and compactly a suitable method of boosting the
bass response of such earpieces.EP-A-0074818 describes an electro-acoustic transducer
having a chamber, a diaphragm extending across the chamber
to define front and rear chamber portions, an end piece
extending over the diaphragm to form a wall of the front
chamber portion and having acoustic inlets therein.
Similar arrangements are found in GB-A-2074418 and GB-A-2192513.
US-A-4239945 describes such a transducer 
incorporating a by-pass Thuras tube in the
end cap, whilst US-A-4796288 describes the provision of a
sinuous discharge path.From one aspect the invention consists in an electro-acoustic
transducer including a body defining a chamber, a
diaphragm extending across at least part of the chamber to
define a front chamber portion and a rear chamber portion,
a grounded metal part within the rear chamber, an end piece
extending across the chamber and forming a wall of the front
chamber portion, the end piece having a main acoustic
inlet/outlet connected to the front portion and a Thuras tube connecting the rear portion
and the main inlet/outlet, characterised in that at least a
portion of the Thuras tube is defined by a channel formed in
the end piece forming the wall of the chamber; and an end
cap overlying the end piece with subsidiary inlets/outlets
formed therein offset from the main inlet/outlet, said end
cap closing off the channel to form said portion of the
Thuras tube, said channel defining an extended air path
between the subsidiary inlets/outlets and the grounded metal
part.The extended path reduces the risk of electrical
discharge occurring along the

<CLAIMS>
An electro-acoustic transducer (10) including a body
(11) defining a chamber (12), a diaphragm (16) extending

across at least part of the chamber (12) to define a front
chamber portion (27) and a rear chamber portion (28), a

grounded metal part (26) within the rear chamber (28), an
end piece (17) extending across the chamber (12) and forming

a wall of the front chamber portion (27), the end piece (17)
having a main acoustic inlet/outlet (20) connected to the front portion (27) and a Thuras tube

connecting the rear portion (28) and the main inlet/outlet

tube is defined by a channel (22) formed in the end piece
(17) forming the wall of the chamber; and an end cap (18)

overlying the end piece (17) with subsidiary inlets/outlets
(19) formed therein offset from the main inlet/outlet (20),

said end cap (18) closing off the channel (22) to form said
portion of the Thuras tube, said channel (22) defining an

extended air path between the subsidiary inlets/outlets (19)
and the grounded metal part (26).
The transducer of Claim 1, wherein the chamber (12) is
generally cylindrical.
