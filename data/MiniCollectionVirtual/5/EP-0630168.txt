<ABSTRACT>
The nucleus block of a Dolby Prologic decoder comprises two main sections: an 
adaptation section (21) and a matrix section (22) comprising voltage controlled 

amplifiers VCA. The adaptive section examines the two channel input signal to 
find in which direction the dominance of the sound field is located, and then generates 

control signals controlling the amplifiers of the matrix section. In this way 
we obtain the four channel output signal (R, L, C and S). According to the invention 

the two channel audio signal (Lt, Rt) is supplied to a block performing linear 
signal processing operations and processing separately the signal of both channels. 

The two channel output signal of the DSP block is the input signal of the matrix 
section (22). In this way it is possible to affect all four output channels by processing 

only two channels, without otherwise interfering with the function of the decoder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Dolby Surround Sound system is widely used as the sound system of movies
but also in video cassettes and other video recordings. The system is also extending
to television applications with stereo sound. The system has four sound channels:
left (L), right (R), center (C) and surround (S). They are encoded in a Dolby encoder
so that L and R are transmitted in the normal way, but the C and S channels
are phase encoded and included in the L and R channels. Both the center channel C
and the surround channel S are divided equally into the L and R channels, but the
components of the surround channel S added to the left and right channels have a
phase difference of 90 degrees.The decoder again separates the encoded four channels. In the passive decoders of
the first generation the left channel L and the right channel R are supplied as such
to the decoder output. These channels also contain information of the channels C
and S. The center channel is detected as the sum of the the L and R channels (the
surround information with opposite phases is canceled) and the S channel is detected
as their difference (the center channel information with the same phase is
canceled).If the Dolby encoded sound is reproduced with conventional two channel stereo
equipment the L and R sounds are localized in a normal way. The center channel C
is localized in the middle of the stereo pair, and the surround channel S is not
clearly localized anywhere, but is heard from an indefinite direction.The encoder is quite simple to realize, and it comprises mainly a simple differential
amplifier, a delay means and filters. The disadvantage of the encoder is that even if
the difference between the main channels L and R as well as the difference between
the center channel C and the surround channel S is higher than 40 dB, the difference
between the adjacent channels (e.g. S and L) is only 3 dB. Therefore we have
a quite small area in which the stereo pattern is good, and in which the center channel
sound seems to be emitted from the middle. Also there is not a good isolation
between the front and back areas, because the surround loudspeakers placed behind
or on the sides of the listening space will reproduce also the difference information
between the left channel L and the right channel. Therefore passive decoders cannot
locate the sounds very accurately, in other words, the sound is not received
from a correct, defined direction, but there is an indefinite impression of the sound. The disadvantages of passive decoders are reduced by an
