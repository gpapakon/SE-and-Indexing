<ABSTRACT>
In a system such as an AUDIX® voice mail system or answering 
machine, a caller's telephone number is extracted from a recorded message using 

voice recognition. The called party initiates automatic dialing of the calling party's 
number after confirming that the number was correctly recognized by the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a message-taking apparatus, and more 
particularly, to a message-taking apparatus that automatically obtains a phone 
number from a verbal message. In the past, a calling party left a verbal message to a called party on an 
answering machine or AUDIX® voice mail system. That verbal message typically 
included a telephone number at which the called party could reach the calling party. 
Typically, the called party listened to the message and then wrote the phone number 
on a piece of paper so that the number would be available when the called party 
placed a telephone call to the calling party. This technique is inconvenient because it 
required the called party to have a pen and paper available when listening to the 
message. It is also possible for the called party to attempt to memorize the phone 
number while listening to the verbal message. This technique is inconvenient 
because the called party could incorrectly memorize the number, and as a result, dial 
an incorrect number while attempting to reach the calling party. Incorrectly 
memorizing the number creates the additional inconvenience of requiring the called 
party to listen to the verbal message a second time in order to make a second attempt 
to memorize the number. The present invention solves the aforementioned problems by obtaining 
a phone number from a verbal message left by a calling party. The phone number is 
communicated to the called party so that the called party can verify the phone 
number with the phone number recited in the verbal message. If the called party is 
satisfied that the phone number was correctly obtained from the verbal message, the 
called party may issue a command that results in the phone number being dialed 
automatically. By automatically extracting a phone number from a verbal message, the 
present invention eliminates the need for the called party to write down or attempt to 
memorize a phone number contained in the verbal message. This avoids the 
inconvenience of requiring the called party to have a pen and paper handy, and it 
also avoids the inconveniences that result from incorrectly memorizing the calling 
party's number.  FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the present invention; FIG. 2 illustrates a table that is used to keep track of messages and 
phone numbers stored by the present invention; FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a control routine executed by the present 
invention; FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an incoming call routine; FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an alternative incoming call
