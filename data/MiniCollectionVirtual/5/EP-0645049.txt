<ABSTRACT>
A material for electrical contacts based on silver-tin oxide which contains tin oxide regions and further oxides and/or carbides in a matrix of silver or an alloy consisting mainly of silver. The further oxides and carbides are contained in the tin oxide regions and/or a transition region between them and the silver matrix. The proportion of the further oxides and carbides together amounts to 40 % wt. in relation to the quantity of tin oxide; the further oxides and carbides may be those of molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, antimony, germanium, vanadium, copper or indium and, apart from a soluble component which may occur, the silver matrix is free of the further oxides and carbides.

A material for electrical contacts taking silver-tin oxide as basis, that contains 
tin-oxide areas and other oxides and/or carbides in a matrix consisting of silver or of 

an alloy mainly consisting of silver, 
characterized in
 that the other oxides and/or 
carbides are contained in the tin-oxide areas and/or in a boundary area between the 

tin-oxide areas and the silver matrix,
 
that the total fraction of the other oxides and carbides amounts of up to 40 per cent 

by weight relative to the amount of the tin oxide,
 
that the other oxides and carbides are those of molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, 

antimony, germanium, vanadium, copper or indium,
 
and that the silver matrix - apart from an eventually soluble fraction contained 

therein - is free of the other oxides and carbides. 
A material according to claim 1, characterized in that the total fraction of the 
tin oxide and of the other oxides and carbides amounts to 5 to 20 per cent by weight 

(relative to the total weight of the material). 
A material according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the total fraction of the 
tin oxide and of the other oxides and carbides amounts to 8 to 15 per cent by weight 

(relative to the total weight of the material). 
A material according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in
 
that the tin-oxide areas contain at least 0.01 per cent by weight (relative to the 

amount of the tin oxide) of the other oxides and/or carbides. 
A material according to any of the above claims, 
characterized in
 that the 
tin-oxide areas contain up to 10 per cent by weight (relative to the amount of the tin 

oxide) of the other oxides and/or carbides.  
 
A material according to any of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that the 
tin-oxide areas contain up to 5 per cent by weight (relative to the amount of the tin 

oxide) of the other oxides and/or carbides. 
A material according to any of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that the 
tin-oxide areas contain up to 2.5 per cent by weight (relative to the amount of the tin 

oxide) of the other oxides and/or carbides. 
A material according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the tin-oxide areas 
contain 0.1 to 1.5 per cent by weight of the other oxides and/or carbides. 
A material according to any of the claims 1 to 8 that is obtained by mixing of 
tin-oxide powder with the other pulverized oxides and/or carbides, calcining of the 

mixture so that by diffusion of the other oxides and/or carbides into the tin-oxide 
powder particles there is produced a composite powder, separating of the excess of 

the other oxides and carbides from the composite powder, and the incorporating of 
the composite powder into a matrix consisting of silver or of a mainly 

silver-containing alloy. 
A material according to any of the claims 1 to 8 that is obtained by spraying 
of a solution of a tin salt and a salt of the metal or of the metals, the oxides or 

carbides of which the material shall contain in addition to the tin oxide, into a hot, 
oxidizing atmosphere in which, by the application of heat, the salts are converted 

into oxides, resulting in the precipitation of a finely divided composite powder, and 
incorporating of the composite powder into a matrix consisting of silver or of a 

mainly silver-containing alloy. 
A material according to any of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in

oxidizing atmosphere a suspension of tin oxide in a solution of a salt of the metal or 

of the salts of the metals, the oxides of which, in addition to the tin oxide, the 
material shall contain; in this hot, oxidizing atmosphere, the salts are thermally 

converted into oxides and settle down on the tin-oxide particles stemming from the 
suspension.
