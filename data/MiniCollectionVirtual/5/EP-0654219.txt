<ABSTRACT>
Carcass dehiding apparatus which has at least one pulling element (19) which can be fastened to part of the hide of the carcass (11) to be dehided and a drive device (22, 30) for imparting a dehiding force to the pulling element (19), characterized in that the drive device (22, 30) is equipped with a pulling force limiting system which automatically reduces the dehiding speed before a maximum permitted dehiding force is reached.

<CLAIMS>
A carcass dehiding apparatus comprising at least one
pulling member (19) adapted to be attached to a hide

portion of the carcass (11) to be dehided, and a
drive means (22, 30) fo
r exerting a hide stripping
force on said pulling member (19),

characterized in that said drive means (22, 30) is
variable in its operating speed in load-dependent

manner, the hide stripping speed, when a threshold
value of the pulling force of the drive means (22,

30) is exceeded and before a maximum permissible
hide stripping force is reached, being reduced automatically

until the threshold value is fallen short
of again.
The apparatus of claim 1,

characterized in that the hide stripping speed can
be reduced automatically down to zero.
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the drive means comprises a
drive motor for a hide wind-up roller (22) and in

that this drive motor is variable in its speed in
load-dependent manner.
The apparatus of claim 3,

characterized in that the drive motor is an electric
motor that is preferably provided with a current

limiter and a frequency converter for speed variation.
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that there is provided a pulling

member wind-up roller (22) and/or a deflection roller
for said pulling member (19); that the drive

means comprises a drive (30) for moving the pulling
member wind-up roller (22) and/or the deflection

roller; and in that said drive (30) is variable in
its operating speed in load-dependent manner.
The apparatus of claim 5,

characterized in that said drive (30) is an electric
motor that is preferably provided with a current

limiter and a frequency converter for speed variation.
The apparatus of claim 5,

characterized in that said drive is a hydraulic
piston and cylinder unit.
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that there is provided a force measuring
means for sensing the hide stripping force or

the holding force present in holding the particular
carcass (11) during dehiding; and in that the signal

of said force measuring means is fed to the drive
means (22, 30).
The apparatus of claim 8,

characterized in that the force measuring means is
provided on a section of a conveying path (15) from

which the carcasses (11) are suspended.
The apparatus of any of claims 3 to 9,

characterized in that the speed of the drive motor
is variable in program-controlled manner in the

course of a dehiding operation. 
The apparatus of any of claims 5 to 10,

characterized in that the driving speed of said
drive (30) is variable in program-controlled manner

in the course of a dehiding operation.
