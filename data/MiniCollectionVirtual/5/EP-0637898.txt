<ABSTRACT>
The kitchen work-surface uses electromagnetic induction to transfer energy by primary heating of a cooking pan, and uses an easily-cleaned stone as the material for the work-surface. The stone, preferably granite, is reinforced e.g. by a carbon fibre laminate, to give it mechanical stability. A cavity is provided in the underside of the surface for receiving an induction coil, without the surface being interrupted by cut-out sections which are normally required for insertion of the hotplate. The work-surface and hotplate are thus integrated in a seamless surface. The stone plate may be used as a homogenous surface for an oven top-plate, and restricted to the size of the hotplate. A removable child-safety bar may be attached beneath the work-surface. A temperature sensor introduced into the cooking food sends signals to a control unit which regulates the timing and temperature of the heating by processor or computer control.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement with a kitchen working plate consisting 
of stone with integrated cooking field for induction 

heating of cooking pots by means of induction coils, 
wherein the cooking field occupies a part of the 

working plate and the entire working or cooking plate, 
respectively, exhibits a continuous upper surface, 

wherein the upper surface of the kitchen working 
plate, in order to avoid damage through burning in and 

scratching thereof, consists of the easy-care and 
durable material stone and wherein the induction coils 

are disposed underneath the surface of the stone, 

characterized by the feature, that the upper surface 
of the working plate has no cut-outs in the area of 

the cooking field, required in order to embed cooking 
fields, and passes practically seamlessly into the 

remaining working plate, and 
by a reinforcement being mounted underneath the 
surface of the working plate, at least in the area of 

the cooking field for the mechanical stabilisation of 
the stone. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the upper surface, restricted to the area of 

the cooking field, is homogeneous. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
chracterized in that a removable bow is mounted under 

the stone plate, serving as children's safety device. 
Arrangement as claimed in any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by a processor or computer controlled 

control device with a temperature probe, that is 
insertable into the cooked food, which allows a time 

and temperature dependent control of the heat supply. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 4, characterized by 
a bordcomputer within the control circuit between 

temperature measurement in the cooked food and 
temperature setting, which is freely programmable by 

means of electronical storage media, for example 
floppy disk or CD, so that cooking programs can be 

repeated automatically.  
 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 5, characterized by 
an operating panel, that is mounted as self-contained 

unit apart from the cooking field and the control 
electronics. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that the operation panel supports both the LCD-display 

screen of the bordcomputer and the operating keyboard 
of the bordcomputer. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 5, characterized by 
an infrared remote control for the control of the 

functions of the stove and a remote control children's 
safety device. 
Arrangement as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized by the employment of carbon fiber 

laminate for the stabilisation of the stone plate, as 
well as employment of granit as robust stone 

material. 
Arrangement as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the working plate, being 

used as well as stove plate, is limited to the size of 
the cooking field. 
Arrangement as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the bordcomputer is a commercially available 

PC (Personal Computer). 
Employment of the arrangement as claimed in claim 
7, characterized in that the operating panel is 

mounted in the steam exhaust hood of the cooking 
arrangement.
