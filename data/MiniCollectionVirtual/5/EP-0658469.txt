<ABSTRACT>
A rubber seal (32) for vehicular ball joint assemblies 
located in the vicinity of a source of heat (30). The seal (32) includes 

an integrally molded metal heat shield for facing the source of 
heat to prevent the deterioration of the seal from the heat. 

Such a seal with integral heat shield is particularly beneficial 
between a vehicle brake rotor (30) and lower control arm (22) and/or a tie 

rod (26) operatively connected to a steering knuckle (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to resilient seals for covering vehicular ball
joints and, more particularly, to such seals which are subjected to heat from adjacent
apparati which may eventually result in the deterioration of the seal.Heretofore, resilient seals mounted around particular ball joint assemblies
which are in the vicinity of heat-inducing devices, such as a vehicle brake rotor, have been
prone to eventually melt through, to thereby open up to deleterious outside effects, such as
water and/or dirt, which are capable of destroying the ball joint's function.European patent application EP-A-570736 discloses use of a separate
protective element over an entire ball joint assembly including the shank and boot seal.
European patent application EP-A-0459644 discloses a ball joint seal having a hollow body
with a first open end and a larger second open end which terminates in an outwardly
extending flange. Molded within the flange is a metal retainer ring to retain the ball joint seal
in place.According to the present invention there is provided for use on a ball joint
assembly adjacent a source of heat, a ball joint seal device including a rubber housing adapted
to mount on said ball joint assembly, characterized in that said ball joint seal device includes
a heat shield integrally formed therewith adjacent said source of heat..According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a ball
joint seal device including a rubber housing having an open end dimensioned to seat at least
partially on a ball joint and an outwardly projecting rubber flange extending peripherally
around said open end, characterized in that a metallic flange extending radially outwardly from
said outwardly projecting rubber flange at least part way around said housing and in that a
heat shielding wall portion extends from and is angled with respect to said metallic flange to
shield the housing from adjacent heat.
