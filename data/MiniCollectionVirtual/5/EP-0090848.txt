 INJECTIONMOLDINGINTEGRALPLASTICKNOCKOUTBackground of the Invention1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a technique for the injection molding of removable sections in polymeric articles.2. Description of the Prior ArtJunction boxes used for making electrical connections typically have circular knockout sections for the optional installation of wiring into the boxes. When the junction boxes are made of metal, the knockout sections are typically made by stamping a pattern in the sheet metal that is used to form the box. In many cases, this results in gaps around the periphery of the knockout piece being - supported at one or two points along its edge. Many types of junction boxes, including pedestals used for the outdoor installation of telephone cable, are made of plastic or other polymeric materials. In many cases, it is desirable to maintain a hermetic seal in such enclosures; therefore, any knockout portions that have not been removed must not have gaps around the edges. The knockout portions should be strong enough to prevent inadvertent leakage prior to the removal of the knockout, but the knockout should also be capable of being removed conveniently, for example with a hammer or other simple tool, without damage to the rest of the enclosure.In the past, one method by which knockout regions have been provided in polymer materials is by first producing a hole of the desired size and plugging it with a grommet to provide a seal until removed. This requires more time and expense than if the knockout were formed directly in the polymer material. However, it is typically not feasible to employ stamping techniques to form a knockout region in polymeric material, especially if it is desired to maintain a hermetic seal prior to removal of the 

knockout .One of the more common molding techniques utilized with polymeric material is injection molding, including reaction injection molding, whereb -fluid polymer or prepolymer material comprising one or more fluid components is* injected under pressure into a cavity having the desired shape. However, restrictions of the flow of the material during injection can produce gaps, voids, and other undesirable effects in the molded article. It is desirable to have a technique for forming a knockout section in an injection molded article that satisfies the above criteria of maintaining a hermetic seal until removed, while allowing ease of removal, and maintaining compatibility with the injection molding process.

 Cla ims
1. A method of making an article by steps comprising introducing fluid plastic precursor material into a cavity, allowing the material to at least partially solidify, and thereafter removing the material from the cavity,
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT a portion, of the material flows through one or more gates (12) between a first region (10) of the cavity and a second region (11) of the cavity, whereby the
.boundary between the resulting first and second regions of the article exclusive of the one or more gates is a weld line formed by the flow front of the material, thereby producing an article having at least one removable piece. 2. The method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the thickness of the boundary (
Ïƒ
) is sufficiently small so that the second region (11) can be removed from the first region (10) of the article by applying a force to the second region that is sufficiently small so that substantially no damage occurs to the first region.
3. The method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the boundary and the one or more gates of the article form a hermetic seal between the first and second regions.
4. The method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the second region (11) is surrounded by the first region (10) .
5. The method in accordance with claim 1, characte ized in that the second region is partially surrounded by the first region.
6. The method in accordance with claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the fluid material is introduced into the first region (10) of the cavity, thereafter flowing through the one or more gates (12) into the second region (11) of the cavity.

 7. The method in accordance with claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the fluid material is introduced into the second region (11) of the cavity, thereafter flowing through the one or more gates (12) into the first region (10) of the cavity.
8. The method in accordance with claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the fluid material is introduced into both the first and second regions of the cavity.
