<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
removal of organic and/or inorganic pollutants from
waste water. More particularly, this invention relates
to a process for removal of such pollutants especially
substituted and unsubstituted phenols by aerobic
biodegradation using a porous biomass support system in
a fixed bed reactor.Various bioremediation processes are
known. For example, US Patent Nos. 4,634,672,

teaches a fixed bed system for biological purification
of water or wastewater, comprising an adsorbent grainy
material and a nonadsorbent grainy medium, wherein the
pressure drop due to plugging of the bed with solid
pollutants is reduced.This invention relates to a process for
purification of a fluid stream comprising one or more 
materials by biodegradation with one or more
microorganisms capable of metabolizing one or more of
said materials, said process comprising:
   passing a fluid feed stream comprising one or more
materials through a reactor containing a fixed
biologically active biomass comprising an effective
number of open or substantially open spaces and a
plurality of biologically active bodies, said bodies
comprising a substrate, and an effective amount of one
or more microorganisms capable of metabolizing at least
one of said materials in said feed stream under process
conditions on, in or on and in said substrate, and said
bodies having a surface to volume ratio which is
greater than that of said open or substantially open
spaces, said bodies and said spaces distributed in said
biomass to allow contact between said feed stream
passing through said open or substantially open spaces
and all or a portion of the internal and external
surfaces of all or a portion of said bodies
