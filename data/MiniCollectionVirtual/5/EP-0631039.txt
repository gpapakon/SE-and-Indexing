<ABSTRACT>
A burner is shown for producing an exhaust gas flow, which is added to the exhaust gas of a vehicle engine in order to bring the engine exhaust gas rapidly up to the temperature required for the downstream catalytic converter. The burner exhibits a division of the combustion air into a primary air flow serving for the ignition of a rich mixture and a secondary air flow (12) of 50 to 70% of the combustion air, which is fed to an annular combustion chamber (1). The fuel is fed directly into the primary combustion air flow by way of a connection piece (8b).

A burner for heating, in a manner independent of the engine, 
a catalytic converter arranged in the exhaust gas line of a 

vehicle engine, having a pipe section (9) to which some of the 
combustion air is supplied in the axial direction as a primary 

air flow and which is provided with a fuel supply arranged 
approximately perpendicular thereto, having, downstream thereof, 

an ignition device (6) which acts in an ignition chamber (4), 
having a combustion chamber (1) constructed as an annular 

chamber, having a tangential connection to the ignition chamber 
and a central supply pipe (2) for the exhaust gas from the 

engine, and having a secondary air supply (12), characterized in 
that the fuel supply is constructed as a fuel supply connection 

piece (8b) projecting into the primary air flow, and in that, 
upstream thereof, the rest qf the flow of combustion air branches 

off as the secondary air supply by way of a pipe (12) and is 
supplied tangentially to the combustion chamber (1). 
A burner according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
pipe (12) projects into the combustion chamber (1) and is 

arranged along a section of the combustion chamber casing. 
A burner according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
section of the combustion chamber casing corresponds to a sector 

angle of at most 45Â°. 
A burner according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that a flame-retaining shield (5) is provided as the 

termination of the ignition chamber (4). 
A burner according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the length of the fuel supply connection piece (8b) 

projecting into the primary air flow is approximately 0.35 to 
0.45 of the diameter D of the air pipe (9) carrying all the  

 
combustion air. 
A burner according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the spacing between the fuel supply connection piece (8b) 

and the ignition device (6) is approximately 2.5 to 3.5 times the 
diameter D of the pipe (9) carrying all the combustion air. 
A combustion chamber according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the spacing between the ignition device (6) 

and the flame-retaining shield is approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times 
the diameter D of the pipe (9) carrying all the combustion air. 
A burner according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
supply pipe (2) for the exhaust gas projects into the combustion 

chamber (1). 
A burner according to Claim 8, characterized in that the 
supply pipe (2) for the exhaust gas has an inlet spray means for 

the exhaust gas. 
A burner according to Claim 8, characterized in that the 
supply pipe (2) for the exhaust gas has inwardly directed exhaust 

gas guide elements in the section thereof which projects into the 
combustion chamber (1). 
A burner according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
ignition device (6) is arranged in the ignition chamber (4) in 

the same longitudinal plane as the fuel supply connection piece 
(8b). 
A burner according to Claim 8, for heating air for heating 
purposes, in a manner independent of the engine, characterized 

in that, instead of exhaust gas, air which flows-through a heat 
exchanger can be supplied to the combustion chamber (1) by way 

of the supply pipe (2).
