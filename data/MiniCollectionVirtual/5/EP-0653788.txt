<ABSTRACT>
A bonding pad (12) is covered by an passivation layer (18) to provide 
insulation and anti-corrosion protection. The passivation layer 

over the bonding pad is etched away to expose a circular area of 
the bonding pad where the bonding wire is attached. By shaping 

the passivation layer on top of the metal area in the form of a 
smooth curvature, there are no sharp edges. The circular exposed 

metal area minimizes the electric field density produced by 
application of a high voltage to the bonding pad and thereby 

avoids breakdown of the passivation layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to bonding pads 
and, more particularly, to a bonding pad having a circular exposed 
area. An integrated circuit typically contains metal channels for 
routing signals throughout the IC. To interconnect the IC 
circuitry to the outside world, most if not all ICs use bonding 
pads to connect the metal channels through bonding wires to the 
pins of the IC package. The bonding pad is disposed on top of the 
semiconductor substrate. The bonding pad is typically composed 
of aluminum with small portions of copper and/or silicon. A 
passivation layer comprising a glass material such as silicon 
oxide or nitride insulates the substrate and bonding pads from 
contamination, corrosion and other external environmental 
conditions. In the prior art, a square or rectangular portion of the 
passivation layer material is etched out exposing the bonding pad 
to make a point of contact for the bonding wire to adhere. A common problem associated with bonding pads occurs in 
high voltage ICs. The high voltage ICs typically have high voltage 
bonding pads and associated metal channels, and low voltage 
metal channels. Although the passivation layer is by nature an 
insulator, it is possible to induce a sufficient potential across 
the passivation layer to breach through its dielectric and short 
the low voltage metal channel. The electric field formed by 
application of a high voltage, say 400 volts or more, to the high 
voltage bonding wire could cause a punch through of the 
passivation layer from the high voltage bonding pad to the low 
voltage metal channel thereby damaging the IC. The problem has long been attributed to sharp perimeter 
corners of the rectangular bonding pad. Prior art solutions have 
involved increasing the distance between the high voltage bonding 
pad and the low voltage metal channel, or providing some type of 
protection circuitry, e.g. diode protection, between the high  
 
voltage bonding pad and the low voltage metal channel. Yet punch 
through problems continue to plague many high voltage ICs. FIG. 1 is top view of a bonding pad; and FIG. 2 is cross-sectional view of the bonding pad. A top view of IC 10 is shown in FIG.1 with bonding pad 12. 
There are a number of bonding pads like 12 on IC 10. Bonding pad 
12 receives a high voltage input signal VHIGH and routes the high 
voltage signal via metal channels to high voltage circuitry in the 
IC (not shown). Bonding pad 12 may be composed of aluminum 
with small additional amounts of copper and/or
