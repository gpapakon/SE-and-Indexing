<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a cramping joint connector for 
connecting a branch coated wire with a main coated wire and 

connecting ends of coated wires. 
Slots (11) and (12) for accommodating coated wires (1) and 
(2) are formed in parallel relationship in an upper part of a 

housing body (10). The slot (11) is a through slot extending 
from one longitudinal end of the housing body (10) to the other 

longitudinal end thereof and adapted to accommodate an intermediate 
portion of the main coated wire (1). The other slot 

(12), one longitudinal end of which is open and the other longitudinal 
end of which is closed, is adapted to accommodate an end 

portion of the branch coated wire (2). At the closed end of the 
slot (12) is formed a holding hole (13) which extends continuously 

from the slot (12) toward the bottom of the housing body 
(10). A cramping contact terminal (15) is fitted transversely 

over the slots (11), (12). The branch coated wire (2) is bent 
after the end thereof in inserted into the holding hole (13), 

and fitted into the slot (12) along an extending direction 
thereof. When a cover member (24) is mounted on the housing 

body (10), the wires (1), (2) are pressed into the corresponding  
 

slots (11), (12), thereby being connected conductively to each 
other. With this arrangement, the wires (1), (2) are cramped at 

proper positions without displacement, allowing the cramping 
operation to be performed efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cramping joint connector for
connecting a branch coated wire with a main coated wire and
connecting ends of coated wires. The term coating includes electrically
insulating material.As a cramping joint connector used to connect a branch
coated wire with a main coated wire, there has been known the
one as shown in Figs. 12 and 13.This connector is constructed such that flutes b, c are
formed in side-by-side relationship in a housing a and a cramping
contact terminal d having two legs is mounted insertably
transversely of the axes of the flutes b, c on an upper face of
the housing a. The flute b is adapted to accommodate a main
coated wire 1 over its entire length. The flute c is provided
with a wall defining an inner end thereof and adapted to accommodate
an end portion of a branch coated wire 2.The main wire 1 is inserted into the flute b along a slit
e which is formed in a side wall defining the flute b in a
direction normal to the axial direction of the flute b. The end
portion of the branch wire 2 is inserted into the flute c in the
axial direction of the flute c. Thereafter, when the cramping
contact terminal d is pressingly inserted with use of a pliers 
or like pinching instrument, the both legs of the cramping contact
terminal d rip the coats of the wires 1, 2, and come into
pressing contact with cores thereof, thereby permitting the
wires 1, 2 to be conductive to each other. Finally, an upper
part of the cramping contact terminal d is covered by a cover
member f.However, the wires 1, 2 are liable to move axially in their
positions accommodated in the flutes b, c in the conventional
connector. Therefore, when the cramping contact terminal d is
pressingly inserted, the wires 1, 2 may displace from their
proper positions and may not be cramped at proper positions.
Particularly, when the branch wire 2 displaces, it is cramped
only slightly, which may cause the leg of the cramping contact
terminal d to lose contact with the core of the wire 2 after the
connection. In an extreme case, the wire 2 may come out of the
flute c, thereby causing a connection error. The narrower the
diameter of the wire relative to the diameter of the flute, the
more marked these problems of the displacement.In order to avoid these problems, the cramping operation is
carried out while holding the wires 1, 2 with finger tips. This
operation has been in fact disadvantageous in terms of working
efficiency because it is very difficult to hold the tiny wires
properly and the wires tend to displace,

<CLAIMS>
A cramping joint connector including a housing body (10)
having a plurality of slots (11, 12) for accommodating a plurality

of coated wires (1,2) and a cramping contact terminal (15)
for ripping coats (3) of the respective coated wires (1, 2) when

accommodated in the housing body (10) and for coming into contact
with cores (4) of the respective coated wires (1,2), thereby

permitting the coated wires (1,2) to be conductive to one
another: comprising


at least one holding means (13; 11a, 12a) formed in the
housing (10, 24) for holding each coated wire (1; 2) at the

housing body (10) before its coat being ripped, characterised in
that
said holding means comprise at least one holding hole
(13) formed in the housing body (10) so that an end portion of a

coated wire (2) may be inserted thereinto, the holding hole (13)
extending perpendicular or tilted to and continuous with the corresponding

slot (12).
A cramping joint connector as defined in claim 1,
wherein said holding means comprise holding portions

(11a, 12a) of said slots (11, 12), said portions (11a,
12a) having a width slightly smaller than the rest of the slots

(11, 12) and the outer diameter of the wires (1, 2). 
A cramping joint connector as defined in claim 2, wherein
said slot portions are upper longitudinal ends (11a, 12a) of

said slots (11, 12).
