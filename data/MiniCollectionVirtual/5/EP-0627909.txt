<ABSTRACT>
A cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition containing a synergistically active oxidation inhibiting system consisting of a combination of a ginkgo extract and at least one polyphenol compound. For example, the ginkgo extract may be a hexane extract of ginkgo leaves and the polyphenol compound may be a flavonoid. Said composition may be used to prevent and treat cell damage on the skin, scalp or mucosae by free radicals induced especially by atmospheric pollutants and/or ultraviolet radiation, and/or for controlling the phenomenon of accelerated skin ageing.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition,
characterized in that it contains an antioxidizing

system possessing a synergistic action consisting of the
combination of a ginkgo extract and at least one polyphenol

compound, it being possible to obtain the said
ginkgo extract by extracting leaves of this plant using

a nonpolar solvent.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized
in that said nonpolar solvent is a C
6
-C
14
 alkane.
Composition according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the said nonpolar solvent is n-hexane.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the said

polyphenol compound contains at least one diphenol
aromatic ring, it being possible for the phenol groups

to be optionally etherified or esterified.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the said

polyphenol compound is chosen from flavonoids, carnosic
acid, carnosol, optionally substituted 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic

and (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)alkylenecarboxylic
acids and their

derivatives, esters or amides of caffeic acid and tannic
acid.
Composition according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the said flavonoids are flavonoids extracted

from tea leaves.
Composition according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the said flavonoids are chosen from taxifolin,

catechin, epicatechin, eriodictyol, naringenin, rutin,
troxerutin, chrysin, tangeretin, luteolin,

epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate,
quercetin, fisetin, kaempferol, galangine, gallocatechin

and epicatechin gallate.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the ginkgo

extract is present at a concentration of between 1 and
10% by weight with respect to the total weight of the

composition.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the polyphenol

compound is present in a proportion of between 0.1 and
1% by weight with respect to the total weight of the

composition.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the ratio by

weight of the ginkgo extract to the polyphenol compound
is between 1 and 100 and in particular in the region of

10.
Use of a combination of at least one ginkgo
extract and at least one polyphenol compound, as

synergistic active combination, in the preparation of a
cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition intended to

prevent or treat cell damage caused, on the skin, scalp
or mucous membranes, by free radicals induced especially

by atmospheric pollutants and/or by ultraviolet
radiation, and/or intended to control the phenomenon of

accelerated skin ageing.
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized
in that the said composition has the

characteristics as defined in any one of Claims 2 to 10.
Process for cosmetic treatment which makes it
possible to control damage, giving an unpleasant

appearance to the skin and hair, caused by free radicals
induced especially by atmospheric pollutants and by

ultraviolet radiation, characterized in that a composition
containing the synergistic combination of a ginkgo 

extract and a polyphenol compound is applied to the skin
or the hair.
Process according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the said composition has the

characteristics as defined in any one of Claims 2 to 10.
