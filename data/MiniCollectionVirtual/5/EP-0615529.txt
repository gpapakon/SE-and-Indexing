<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to films comprising a
melt-stable, biodegradable, lactide polymer composition
and processes for manufacturing the films from the melt-stable,
biodegradable polymer.The need for polymeric biodegradable films is well
established. Films manufactured from blown or cast
processes are well known. Typically in a blown film
process, a plastic melt passes through a die which
extrudes the molten plastic into an annular shape.
Typically, the extruded film is extruded in an upward
fashion. As the film moves upward, air is blown into
the film which expands the film into a tubular shape.
The tube is generally closed at some distance above the
die, with a pair of nip rolls.In a cast film process, a sheet is typically
extruded from a slit die. The sheet is thereafter
Pulled through a series of rollers which cool the
extruded sheet and may also elongate the length and
width of the sheet to a desired dimension and thickness.The use of films is widespread and well known in the
art. The heaviest use of films occurs in the packaging
and disposable article industries. Films employed in
the packaging industry include films used in food and
non-food packaging, merchandise bags and trash bags. In
the disposable article industry, the general uses of
films occur in the construction of diapers and personal
hygiene articles, including tapes. In order to meet projected needs for biodegradable
packaging materials, others have endeavored to optimize
lactide polymer processing systems. Gruber et al. (U.S.
Pat. No. 5,142,023) disclose a continuous process for
the manufacture of lactide polymers with controlled
optical purity from lactic acid having physical
properties suitable for replacing present petrochemical-based
polymers.Generally, manufacturers of polymers utilizing
processes such as those disclosed by Gruber et al. will
convert raw material monomers into polymer beads, resins
or other pelletized or powdered products. The polymer
in this form may then be sold to end users who convert,
i.e., extrude, blow-mold, cast films, blow films,
thermoform, injection-mold or fiber-spin the polymer at
elevated temperatures to form useful articles. The
above processes are collectively referred to as melt-processing.
Polymers produced by processes such as
those disclosed by Gruber et al., which are to be sold
commercially as beads, resins, powders or other non-finished
solid forms are generally referred to
collectively as polymer resins.Prior to the present invention and its related
patent applications, it is
