<ABSTRACT>
A disinfectant composition comprising as active ingredients 
4-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-4-yl)pyrrole-3-carbonitrile and 

penta-4-enyl-N-furfuryl-N-imidazol-1-ylcarbonyl-DL-homoalaninate 
exhibits high synergistic effect by the joint use of the two active 

ingredients and has remarkably high effect in a low amount against Bakanae disease, blast, 
leaf spot, loose smut, Septoria leaf blight, snow mold on cereals such as rice, wheat, 

barley etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microbicidal composition comprising as active
ingredients 4-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-4-yl)pyrrole-3-carbonitrile (hereinafter called
compound A) and penta-4-enyl-N-furfuryl-N-imidazol-1-ylcarbonyl-DL-homoalaninate
(hereinafter called compound B).By disinfecting seeds of various cereal plants such as rice, wheat, barley etc. prior to
seeding thereof with said composition, it is possible to kill phytopathogenic fungi, which
are parasitic on the seeds, and to protect seeds from the soil-epidemic germs which live in
soil and invade seeds and young seedlings after the seeding to cause damages. Therefore,
the disinfectant composition is useful in agricultural and horticultural fields.It is known by Japanese Patent Kokai Sho 62-483 and Brighton Crop Protection
Conference "Pests and Diseases 1990", Vol. 2, pp. 399-406 that compound A has a broad
activity spectrum against phytopathogenic fungi such as Botrytis, Monilinia, Sclerotinia,
Rhizoctonia, Alternaria etc and shows high controlling effect in the form of a spray for
leaves and stems. It is also knwon by "Entrusted trial test data book for rice fungicides" by
Japan Plant Protection Association, 1992, Vol. 34, pp. 362-458 and Brighton Crop
Protection Conference "Pests and Diseases 1990", Vol. 2 (1990), pp. 825-830
that the
compound shows high seed disinfection effect against rice diseases such as Bakanae
disease, blast, leaf spot and also wheat diseases such as loose smut, Septoria leaf blight,
snow mold etc.On the other hand, compound B, the other active ingredient of the present invention, is
known by "Agricultural Chemicals Handbook, 1992" published by Japan Plant Protection
Association as of July 30, 1992, pp. 224-549 that the compound is used for a seed
disinfectant against rice Bakanae disease, rice blast, rice leaf spot and various diseases on
wheat and vegetables.However, the mixture of compound A and compound B has not been predescribed. Until now, mixtures of a benzimidazole derivative and thiuram have been widely used as
seed disinfectants. These compounds are known by "Agricultural Chemicals Handbook,
1992" published by Japan Plant Protection Association on July 30, 1992), pp. 192-198
and
171-173. However, as the result of long and continuous use of said mixtures in recent
years, a problematic Bakanae disease germ has appeared which is resistant to
benzimidazole type microbicides.Furthermore, the benzimidazole compound has poor permeability and thus shows
somewhat lesser effect to the seeds infected in
