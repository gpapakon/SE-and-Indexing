<ABSTRACT>
A spot welding method and apparatus having 
electrode tips (3, 4) one of which is driven by a servo 

motor (26). In the method and apparatus, it is determined 
whether or not an abnormal condition occurs. The abnormal 

condition includes (a) squeezing some obstacle (60) between 
the electrode tip (3, 4) and a workpiece (6), (b) a 

temperature adhesion of the electrode tips (3, 4) with the 
workpiece (6), (c) uneven pressurizing of the workpiece by 

the electrode tips (3, 4), (d) a weld nugget dispersion, and 
(e) a too large electric resistance between the electrode 

tips (3, 4) and the workpiece (6). When such abnormal 
condition is detected, some counter measure is taken to 

prevent or decrease the abnormal condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spot welding 
control method and apparatus using a servo welding gun. Automobile body panels are spot-welded using a 
welding apparatus constructed of a general purpose robot 
having six degrees of freedom and a spot welding gun coupled 
to a wrist portion of the robot. The conventional spot 
welding gun has a pair of electrode tips for pressing a 
workpiece therebetween, and one of the pair of electrode 
tips is reciprocally moved by an air cylinder. Meanwhile, a servo welding gun having a pair of 
electrode tips, one of which is driven by a servo motor, was 
proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent 
Application No. 5-261560 filed on March 23, 1992 and published on 
12.10.93. In the 
proposed servo welding gun, contact of the welding tip with 
a workpiece was controlled based on only the servo motor 
electric current. However, the proposed spot welding control using 
the servo welding gun does not fully utilize the 
capabilities of the servo welding gun, and has the following 
problems which need to be solved.  
 First, is some obstacle happens to come between the pair 
of electrode tips so that the moving electrode tip contacts 
the obstacle, the servo motor electric current suddenly 
increases and an erroneous assumption will be made that the 
electrode tip is in contact with the workpiece. Second, temperature adhesion of the electrode tip with 
the workpiece is visually judged by sight by a worker. The 
servo motor electric current is not used in an automatic 
detection of such temperature adhesion. Third, because only one of the pair of electrode tips is 
moved, changing the contact position where the electrode tip 
contacts the workpiece will cause a change in the pressing 
force of the electrode tip. In some cases, the workpiece may 
be damaged by excessive force from the electrode tip. Fourth, no measure to counter fused metal dispersion at 
the welding nugget is taken. More particularly, any signal of 
the servo motor is used in detecting or predicting generation 
of fused metal dispersion. Fifth, electric resistance between the electrode tip and 
the workpiece is not decreased in the servo welding gun 
system, though a large electric resistance between the 
electrode tip and the workpiece tends to generate fused metal 
dispersion at the nugget. EP-A-0,566,741, which is state of the art according to Art. 
54(3)EPC, discloses an abnormal load detecting 
method in which an abnormal load applied to a servo motor is 
detected based on a detected
