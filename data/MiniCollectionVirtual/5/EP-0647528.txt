<ABSTRACT>
Catch mechanisms (40) are provided on the interior 
surfaces (34, 36) of a flexible, collapsible ink container 

(10). The catch mechanisms secure the empty container in a 
compact orientation for easy handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to containers used for
supplying ink to ink-jet printers.One type of ink-jet printer includes a
carriage that is reciprocated back and forth across a
sheet of paper that is advanced through the printer.
The reciprocating carriage holds a pen very close to
the paper. The pen is controlled by the printer for
selectively ejecting ink drops from the pen while the
pen is reciprocated or scanned across the paper,
thereby to produce characters or an image on the paper.The pen carries a reservoir for holding a
limited amount of ink. A relatively larger supply of
ink is provided in a stationary container that is
mounted to the printer. A tube is connected between
the supply container and the pen. The tube conducts
the flow of ink from the supply container to the pen
for replenishing the pen reservoir as needed.
Alternatively, the pen and supply container can be
constructed so that the pen occasionally engages the
supply container to draw ink from the container and
thereby replenish the reservoir.Use of a separate, stationary ink supply is
advantageous for a number of reasons. For example, an
empty supply container can be replaced with a filled 
container without also replacing the relatively costly pen.Unless properly designed, ink supply containers can present
problems in handling once they are emptied and removed from
the printer. In this regard, the emptied bags may be
difficult to compact for handling efficiently. Moreover,
residual amounts of ink in the otherwise empty containers
may be "pumped" out of an empty container if that container
is permitted to expand and contract during handling. It is
also important that the emptied containers be easily
recyclable.DE-A-3 501 399 describes a a flexible plastics container
for storing creams, pastes etc. The container is expandable
into a filled configuration and has first and second
spaced-apart interior surfaces which are movable together
as the contents are depleted. The first and second surfaces
have a catch mechanism attached thereto for holding the container
in its collapsed configuration.
The catch mechanism is formed on both surfaces by elongated
transverse grooves which can snap together. In accordance with the present invention there is provided
a compactable ink container and a method of compacting a
flexible ink container as specified in claims 1 and 6
hereinafter.This invention is directed to an ink supply container that,
once emptied, is readily compacted into a configuration that
is easy to handle, easy to recycle, and avoids
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A compactable ink container, comprising:

a case (10) for storing ink, the case being expandable
into a filled configuration when storing ink;
the case (10) defining a first interior surface (34)
and a second interior surface (36), the first and second

interior surfaces being spaced from one another when the
case is in the filled configuration, the first and second

interior surfaces being movable together as ink is depleted
from the case, thereby to define a collapsed configuration

of the case; and
a catch mechanism having,
in the collapsed configuration,

a two dimensional array of
discrete catch elements (40) spaced one from another and

attached to the said first and second surfaces for holding
the case (10) in said collapsed configuration,
a first portion of each catch element being located
on the said first surface and a second complementary portion

of each catch element being located on the said second
surface.
The container of claim 1, wherein the catch mechanism
includes an array of barbed members (42) attached to the

first surface (34) and an array of sockets (46) attached to
the second surface, each socket being configured to receive

and hold a barbed member.
The container of claim 2, wherein the barbed members
(42) are posts that protrude from the first interior surface

(34) and that have barbed outermost ends (44).
The container of claim 2, wherein the socket array
includes a plurality of elongated sockets (50) that receive

more than one of the barbed members (42).
The container of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the case is formed of resilient material so that, 

when ink is depleted from the container, the case contracts
into the collapsed configuration.
A method of compacting a flexible ink container (10)
that contains ink and that has opposing interior surfaces

(34, 36) the method comprising the steps of:

coupling the container to a reservoir of an ink-jet
pen;
removing ink from the container;
moving the opposing surfaces toward one another; and
securing together the opposing interior surfaces
thereby to prevent those portions from thereafter moving

apart.
The method of claim 6, wherein the securing step
includes providing a barbed member (42) on one surface

portion and a socket member (50) on the other surface
portion and pressing the barbed member into the socket

member.
