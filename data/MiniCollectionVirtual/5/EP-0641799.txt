This invention pertains to alkylsiloxanes that 
comprise greater than 99.9% alkylsiloxanes and contain less 

than 10 ppm -SiH, less than 10 ppm CH

=CH- and less than 1 
ppm platinum. The pristine alkylsiloxanes of our invention 

are produced by reacting an -SiH containing polysiloxane 
with an olefinic compound, under anhydrous conditions, in 

the presence of a supported platinum catalyst and oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pristine alkylsiloxanes 
that consist of less than 10 ppm -SiH and are further 
described as being greater than 99.9% alkylsiloxanes. Methods for making alkylsiloxanes are well known 
in the art. U.S. Patent No. 3,440,263 to Brennan discloses 
a method for making modified silicone polymers wherein the 
olefinic compound is percolated over activated alumina and 
collected into an inert atmosphere prior to the reaction. 
Brennan further suggests the use of platinum catalyst that 
is deposited on an inert substance (heterogeneous catalyst). 
However, the method disclosed by Brennan does not produce 
pristine alkylsiloxanes. The resulting product is 
contaminated with residual -SiH and it is feasible for 
minute quantities of the platinum catalyst to solubilize 
into the reaction mixture. However, these methods result in low quality or 
impure alkylsiloxanes that can result in a product which 
contains color and/or odor. The most common method for 
producing alkylsiloxanes is to react an olefinic compound 
(H₂C=CH-) with an -SiH containing polysiloxane using a 
platinum catalyst (hydrosilylation reaction). However, 
hydrosilylation reactions are known in the art as possessing 
several drawbacks. One drawback is the use of homogeneous 
catalysts, such as chloroplatinic acid, which cannot be 
removed following reaction completion. This causes 
impurities in the product and also provides the product with 
a yellow or colored hue. Even when heterogeneous catalysts, 
such as platinum supported on an inert substance, are used; 
the same color and contamination can result if there is 
moisture in the reactants. Such moisture will cause the 
platinum to solubilize in the product. Another drawback of  
 
the prior art methods is a large excess of the olefinic 
compound is required to drive the reaction to near 
completion. Even with the use of a large excess of the 
olefinic compound, there is a high concentration of 
unreacted -SiH in the product which is a problem. Further, 
the olefinic compound can isomerize thereby producing 
undesirable, internal olefins. The presence of internal 
olefins has several effects on the reaction and products. 
First, the internal olefins produce stronger complexes with 
the platinum thus retarding or inhibiting completion of the 
hydrosilylation reaction. Further, once these internal 
olefins are bound to any solubilized platinum that is 
present in the reaction system, it becomes nearly impossible 
to remove them. Finally, any unreacted olefin cannot be
