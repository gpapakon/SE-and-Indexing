<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of pelleted seedstock with a predetermined, uniform number of seeds per grain, and a process for the production thereof. The seedstock is composed of a core which, taking into account the properties of the seeds, is selected, produced and/or pretreated and of seeds which are embedded, such that they cannot be stripped off, in an extender composition adhering to the surface of the core. The process according to the invention is characterised in that a homogeneous mixture is produced from a specific number of the seeds and a specific quantity of the extender composition, a predetermined number of the cores is coated, in a rapid and gentle manner, with a specific quantity of the mixture by circulation in a container, and the resulting pellets are dried.

Method of manufacturing pelletised seeds with a number of
seeds pet granule, in which a homogenous mixture is produced of a

specific number of seeds and a specific quantity of expanded
compound, a predetermined number of cores are coated rapidly and

gently by circulation in a container with a specific quantity of
the mixture, the cores being poured into the container and

partial quantities of the mixture and partial quantities of a
moisturizer being alternately fed in a metered fashion into the

container, the number of seeds and the quantity of expanded
compound being co-ordinated to one another in the mixture in such

a way that the seeds, in a condition embedded in expanded
compound, are deposited on the cores, and the pellets thus

obtained are dried, characterised in that predetermined uniform
numbers of seeds per granule are deposited in a strongly-adhering

manner on the cores in such a way that cores with surfaces are
used which have sufficiently large quantities and/or large sizes

of pores or crevices, and in that the cores are selected and/or
manufactured and/or pre-treated taking into account the

properties of the seeds.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
number of seeds and the quantity of expanded compound are coordinated

with one another in such a way that the outer surfaces
of the seeds remain exposed in the embedded condition.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
pre-treatment of the cores is effected by disinfection or

sterilisation before coating.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the manufacture of the cores is such that their shape is

adapted to the shape of the seeds. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the cores are manufactured by comminution and fractionation.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the pre-treatment of the cores is effected by coating with

an enveloping compound if necessary mixed with a binder.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the metered addition of the partial quantities is so

selected in dependence on the container size and the circulation
speed that a uniform circulation of the compound is obtained

during the entire coating process.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the quantity of expanded compound in the mixture is so

selected that the seeds during coating are only partially
embedded, and that thereafter further partial quantities of

expanded compound and moisturizer are alternately applied.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that a binding agent is added to the expanded compound and/or the

moisturiser.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that the pelletised seed after coating is transferred for drying

preferably into a fluidised bed drier and at a gentle temperature
of for example 25Â°C is dried until, with stable hardening of its

coating and shape, a reduction of its moisture to the original
content of the seeds or less is effected.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that the preferred seeds of the pelletised seed originate from

the following list: 

Pelletised seed with a number of seeds per granule
consisting of cores and seeds, which are embedded in an expanded

compound adhering to the surface of the core, characterised in
that the cores are selected and/or manufactured and/or pretreated

taking into account the properties of the seeds, and
their surfaces have so many and/or such large pores or crevices

that a predetermined uniform number of seeds is deposited in a
securely-adhering manner on the cores.
Seed according to claim 12, characterised in that the seeds
are embedded in the expanded material in such a way that their

outer surfaces remain exposed.
Seed according to claim 12 to 13, characterised in that the
shape of the cores is adapted to the shape of the seeds.
Seed according to one of claims 12 to 14, characterised in
that cores are coated with an enveloping compound.
