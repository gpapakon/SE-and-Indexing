<ABSTRACT>
An engine for a series of V type piston engines 
which have a common offset (L5) between banks of cylinders 

and the same V angle, achieved by using a connecting rod 
offset (L4) for different engines such as a V6 and a V8 

type. In the V6 the centres (31) of adjacent big end 
bearings (21) are spaced further apart (L7) than the bank 

offset and in the V8 the centres of adjacent big end 
bearings are spaced (L6) closer than the bank offset. 
In the V6 engine the connecting rod offset (L4) is 
advantageously one quarter of the axial distance (L3) 

separating adjacent side faces of the big end bearings, 
allowing a common connecting rod offset.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to V type piston engines. 
Particularly it relates to V-type engines for use in a 
series as described and claimed in application number 
91306632.0 (EP-A-0470721) from which this application is 
divided. Such a series includes a V6 type and a V8 type 
which are generally well known as motor vehicle power 
units. The V8 type of engine commonly has two banks of four 
cylinders with the banks at 90 degrees to each other. It 
uses a crankshaft having four crank throws and four 
crankpins so that the big end bearing of the connecting 
rod of each cylinder in one bank and the big end bearing 
of the connecting rod of the opposite cylinder in the 
other bank are journalled side by side on a common 
crankpin. The crankpin is of uniform diameter and axis 
and there is no substantial separation between adjacent 
side faces of the big end bearings. The cylinders of one 
bank are offset relative to the crankpin axis from those 
of the other bank by an amount equivalent to the axial 
distance between the side faces of one big end bearing, 
this being called the bank offset. The V6 type of engine commonly uses a crankshaft having 
three crank throws and three crankpins. Again, the big 
end bearing of the connecting rod of each cylinder in one 
bank and the big end bearing of the connecting rod of the  
 
opposite cylinder in the other bank are journalled side by 
side on a common crankpin. However, if the crankpin is of 
uniform diameter and axis and there is no substantial 
separation between adjacent side faces of the big end 
bearings then the cylinder banks have to be arranged at 60 
degrees to each other if engine firing intervals are to be 
even. There is relatively little opportunity to exploit 
common components or use common machining facilities with 
a 90 degree V8 and a 60 degree V6. A 90 degree V6 can be 
designed and many are in use. However, to give even 
firing intervals and acceptable low speed refinement the 
common crankpin has to have offset axes. To maintain an 
adequate cross-sectional area along the crankpin and avoid 
high stress concentrations the journal areas on the common 
crankpin are separated by an integral collar. In existing 
designs this collar increases the bank offset so that this 
amounts to the axial thickness of the collar plus the 
axial distance between the sides of the big end bearing. 
Thus whilst there can be some use of common components 
between a 90 degree V8 and a 90 degree V6, there is a 
different bank offset which makes it difficult to machine 
a

<CLAIMS>
A piston engine having an engine block (11) comprising 
two banks (12, 13) of two or more cylinders arranged in 

V formation, a crankshaft (14) journalled in the engine 
block and having two or more crankpins (22a), pistons 

(16), each guided for reciprocal movement in a 
respective cylinder bore, and connecting rods (17a), 

each having a small end bearing (18) at one end 
connected to a respective piston and a big end bearing 

(21) at the other end, the big end bearing of the 
connecting rod of each cylinder in one bank and the big 

end bearing of the connecting rod of the opposite 
cylinder in the other bank being journalled side by side 

with axial separation of adjacent side faces of the 
respective big end bearings on a common crankpin formed 

with offset axes (23a, 23b), the axes (29) of the 
cylinders of one bank (12) being offset, relative to the 

crankshaft axis, from the axes of the cylinders of the 
other bank (13) by an amount called the bank offset 

(L5), the axis of each cylinder being offset relative to 
the crankshaft axis from the axial centre (31) of the 

respective big end bearing by an amount called the 
connecting rod offset (L4) and arranged so that the bank 

offset is less that the distance (L7) between the axial 
centres of the big end bearings on the respective 

crankpin.  
 
An engine according to Claim 1 wherein the magnitude 
of the connecting rod offset (L4) is one quarter of the 

axial distance (L3) separating adjacent side faces of 
the big end bearings (21) on each crankpin (22a).
