<ABSTRACT>
A bi-level control system includes a plurality of slave units, each for 
connection to a respective ballast and HID lamp of a plurality of HID lighting fixtures, 

and a common control unit. Each slave unit includes a switched capacitor and a slave 
relay which has one input connectable to a common line of a AC power supply branch 

circuit powering the fixtures and another input adapted for receiving a line voltage 
signal. The control unit includes an output connected to the control inputs of each of the 

slave units by a single control line and switchably connected to line voltage. Dimming 
of the HID lamp is accomplished by switching line voltage to the output of the control 

unit which causes the slave relay to switch the slave capacitor into circuit with the HID 
lamp and ballast. Use of a single control line connecting each of the slave units to the 

control unit greatly reduces wiring over known systems. The control unit is also adapted 
to receive a control input from a sensor via a single input line, further reducing wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bi-level control system for operating high
intensity discharge lamps at a first light output level and a second, reduced light output
level, and more particularly, to improvements in such a control system which employs a
switched capacitor for regulating the power supplied to the lamps. The invention also
relates to a HID lighting system having such a control system and to components of
the control system.High intensity discharge (HID) lamps include, for example, mercury
vapor, metal halide, and high pressure sodium discharge lamps. These lamps are
operated with a ballast circuit to control the lamp operating current because of the
negative voltage-current characteristics of the discharge arc within these lamps.
Conventionally, electromagnetic transformer ballasts having a series connected
inductance and capacitance (L-C circuit) in the form of a choke and capacitor, have
been employed for this purpose.Typically, the ballast, HID lamp, and reflector are combined into a
fixture, or luminaire. For general illumination of, for example, warehouses and
factories, a large number of luminaires are suspended from a ceiling. Generally, a
plurality of the luminaires are connected in an alternating current (AC) power supply
branch circuit and controlled by a single switch or circuit breaker which is effective to
switch all of the lamps between a "off" state, in which the lamps are completely
extinguished, and an "on" state in which the lamps are operated at full rated power.Recently, because of energy saving considerations, it has become
desirable in other types of lighting systems, for example fluorescent lighting, to employ
more sophisticated controls such as occupancy sensors to turn the lamps off when
nobody is present in a room and to turn the lights on when someone enters. However,
this is not practical for HID lamps, which typically require several minutes to ignite,
warm-up and reach their full light output levels. Additionally, most HID lamps have hot 
re-strike problems which makes it difficult to reignite the lamp shortly after being
turned off while they still remain at a elevated temperature. With some lamp-ballast
combinations it may take up to approximately ten minutes after a lamp has been turned
off before it will re-ignite. Thus, employing a control system which turns HID lamps
completely off when someone leaves the lighted space is not feasible because the lamps
will not provide sufficient light quickly enough if someone re-enters the space shortly
thereafter.However,
