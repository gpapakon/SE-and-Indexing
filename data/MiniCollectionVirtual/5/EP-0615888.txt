<ABSTRACT>
A resilient plastic cover for an air bag of a 
vehicle occupant restraint system including a front wall 

(10) with tear lines (20, 22) positioned inwardly from 
outer margins of the front wall and which define two 

substantially rectangular doors which rotate open about 
door hinges when the air bag is deployed. Pairs of arcuate 

secondary tear lines (26, 28) extend from each first tear 
line (20, 22) to the outer margins of the cover front wall 

(20) permitting wide opening of the doors. A thinned 
region of the cover permits flattening of a hinge axis and 

thickened cover region adjacent to the secondary tear lines 
(26, 28) prevents tearing between each pair of secondary 

tear lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to airbags for automotive crash
protection. More specifically, it relates to an improved cover
for an airbag installation.Automotive airbags are commonly installed to protect
both the driver and the front seat passenger from injury in the
event of a head-on collision. The term "airbag" is something of
a misnomer because typically the bag is filled with a rapidly
evolving gas produced by an igniter. The bag is designed to
inflate in no more than approximately 15 milliseconds. In its
uninflated and folded condition it is mounted within a housing
having a cover which is designed to tear along predetermined
lines to provide an opening for the escape of the airbag.In view of the explosive nature of the airbag
inflation, one of the major problems with prior art installations
has been the tendency of the airbag cover to break into pieces.
The pieces thereupon become projectiles capable of striking the
occupants.Airbag covers customarily are formed of materials such
as thermoplastics which are somewhat resilient and have weakened
or thinned regions forming tear lines. The tear lines are
designed to rupture and form one or more hinged doors which
permit the expanding airbag to escape. Ideally the shearing
stress which bursts the tear lines is dissipated within
sufficient time and distance to allow the formation of hinges
which permit the doors to open but retain them in place on the
cover. One such airbag module cover is disclosed in EP-A-0489922 
(on which the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 is
based). The cover includes two substantially rectangular
doors defined by an "H" shaped tear line pattern which doors
have side edges spaced inwardly from those of the cover. The
tear line pattern has peripheral portions which extend
outwardly to upper and lower edges of a front surface of the
cover. Upon deployment of an airbag contained by the cover,
the tear lines rupture permitting each door to hinge outwardly
about a hinge line located along an upper or lower edge of the
front surface of the cover. The extent of hingeing is
accordingly limited by the interconnection between each door
and a side portion of the cover.It would be desirable for the doors to swing open 
through an arc exceeding 180Â° in order for them to be positioned
well clear of the expanding airbag. Finally, it would be
desirable to achieve these objectives while employing a one piece
molded cover without the need for inserts or hardware elements.Thus according to the invention there is provided a
vehicle occupant restraint

<CLAIMS>
A resilient cover for use in an air bag vehicle occupant
restraint system having a front wall (10) defining first tear

lines (20, 22) rupturable upon expansion of said air bag to
form first and second substantially rectangular hinged doors

(30, 32) through which said bag expands, each of said doors
(30, 32) having edges displaced inwardly from two opposed

sides of said front wall (10), and rearwardly extending
sidewalls (12, 14) surrounding said front wall (10) to enclose

the unexpanded bag, wherein first and second pairs of
secondary arcuate tear lines (26, 28) extend from the first

tear lines (20) to outer margin (24) of said front wall (10)
thereby forming door hinges (33, 34),

characterised in that the doors (30, 32) are surrounded by a
groove (20) part of which constitutes said first tear lines

and remaining parts of which each extend between one said pair
of secondary arcuate tear lines (26, 28) and are spaced

inwardly from said outer margin (24) of said front wall (10)
whereby upon air bag deployment full swinging motion of the

doors (30, 32) is possible.
The cover of claim 1 wherein one of said front
wall margins (24) is curved prior to rupture and is

resiliently forced into a substantially straight
configuration upon formation of one of said hinges (34).
The cover of claim 1 or 2 wherein said cover
includes means (38) for preventing tearing between each

pair of said secondary arcuate tear lines (26, 28).
The cover of any preceding claim wherein said
cover includes tear preventing means (38) for preventing

tearing between each pair of said secondary arcuate tear
lines (26, 28), said tear preventing means (38) comprises a

thickened portion of said cover intermediate each pair of
secondary arcuate tear lines (26, 28). 
The cover of claim 4 wherein said thickened
portion (38) comprises a barrier adjacent the respective

secondary arcuate tear lines of each pair (26, 28).
The cover of claim 2 wherein said door hinge
(34) is in a thinner region of said cover.
The cover of claim 6 wherein said thinner region of said
door hinge is formed between said first and second pairs of

secondary tear lines (26, 28).
The cover of any preceding claim wherein said
cover is formed from a thermoplastic resin.
A vehicle occupant restraint system including a
cover as claimed in any preceding claim.
