<ABSTRACT>
In a cellular communication system, an array of sector antennas is 
provided at each cell site for respectively covering sectors of the service 

area of the cell site. At each cell site, undesired signals of different 
channels are received by each antenna, and their magnitudes are 

determined. One of the signals is selected from each set of signals from 
the antennas depending on their magnitudes to produce channel signals 

respectively for the different channels. A list of candidate channels is 
determined corresponding to those of the channel signals whose qualities 

are higher than a threshold. One of the candidate channels is selected 
from the list depending on the magnitudes of those channel signals 

whose qualities are higher than the threshold. The selected candidate 
channel is assigned to a mobile station if the selected channel has 

acceptable quality. Otherwise, it is discarded from the list and the attempt 
is repeated to select a further candidate channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cellular communication
systems, and more specifically to dynamic assignment of channels to
mobile stations from a base station using an array of antennas
respectively covering sectors of the service area of the base station.EP-A-0 430 173
describes a method of assigning radio communication channels to each of a plurality
of mobile stations.The capacity of a cellular mobile communication system may be
increased by reducing the size of the cells so that the total number of
channels available per unit area is increased. This is achieved in practice
by the process of "cell splitting" where new base stations are
established. As the cells are split into smaller sizes, the co-channel
interference from distant cells increases. One way of reducing the level of
co-channel interference is to use directional antennas at base stations, with
each antenna illuminating or covering a sector of the cell, whereas
ominidirectional antennas are used in non-sectorized cells.Dynamic channel assignment schemes are known for efficient
utilization of channels, and used for systems of non-sectorized cells. For
sectorized cells, a dynamic channel assignment scheme is described in a
paper "Channel Segregation, A Distributed Adaptive Channel Allocation
Scheme for Mobile Communication Systems", Y. Furuya et al., Second
Nordic Seminar on Digital Land Mobile Radio Communication, Stockholm,
1986, pages 311-315. According to the proposed scheme priorities are
assigned to a list of available channels according to past records of co-channel
interference. On receiving a request from a mobile station, a
channel is selected from the list according to the priorities so that the
mobile station has a reduced chance of encountering co-channel 
interference. A dynamic channel assignment scheme for efficient
utilization of channels in sectorized cells is described in a paper "Adaptive
Channel Allocation in a TIA IS-54 System", H. Andersson et al., Vehicular
Technology Conference, 1992, pages 778 to 781. According to this
scheme, carrier-to-interference ratio is used as criteria for assigning priorities
to available channels.However, there is still a need for improvements in dynamic
channel assignment scheme for sectorized cells in terms of the utilization
of channels, the number of channel selection attempts for each request,
and the probability of co-channel interference. More specifically, assume
that, in a sectorized cellular communication network, first and second
mobile stations are respectively
