Filter tow comprising cellulose acetate filaments and/or cellulose acetate
spun fibres substantially produced by spinning cellulose acetate filaments by

pressing a solution of cellulose acetate, with an acetyl number of at least 53%,
in acetone through a spinning nozzle with a plurality of openings and optionally

subsequently cutting the cellulose acetate filaments into cellulose acetate spun
fibres and combining a plurality of the cellulose acetate filaments and/or

cellulose acetate spun fibres thus obtained into a filter tow, characterised in that
the cellulose acetate filaments or the cellulose acetate spun fibres are subjected

to a hydrolysis treatment such that the cellulose acetate situated at the surface of
these filaments and spun fibres has an acetyl number of less than 53%,

preferably of less than 49%, after the hydrolysis treatment.
Method of manufacturing a filter tow as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the hydrolysis treatment is performed with the aid of caustic soda or with

the aid of gaseous ammonia.
Tobacco smoke filter element comprising a section of a transverse
axially compressed filter tow as claimed in claim 1 hardened with the aid of a

plasticiser for cellulose acetate or an adhesive.
Method of manufacturing a tobacco smoke filter element as claimed in
claim 3 by providing a filter tow, comprising cellulose acetate filaments and/or

cellulose acetate spun fibres, with a plasticiser for cellulose acetate or an
adhesive, subsequent transverse axial compression and optionally enveloping

this filter tow with a wrapping sheet, cutting the thus compressed and optionally 
enveloped filter tow into individual tobacco smoke filter rods and subsequently

cutting these tobacco smoke filter rods into individual tobacco smoke filter
elements, characterised in that a filter tow is used in which the cellulose acetate,

of which the cellulose acetate filaments and the cellulose acetate spun fibres
consist, is soluble in acetone and has an acetyl number of at least 53% and the

cellulose acetate filaments or spun fibres are subjected to a hydrolysis treatment
such that the cellulose acetate situated at the surface of the cellulose acetate

filaments or spun fibres has an acetyl number of less than 53%, preferably of
less than 49%, after the hydrolysis treatment.
Method as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the hydrolysis
treatment is performed with the aid of caustic soda or with the aid of gaseous

ammonia.
Method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the hydrolysis
treatment is performed with the aid of gaseous ammonia on the tobacco smoke

filter rods or on the tobacco smoke filter elements.
