There is disclosed an ion mobility detector having 
a sample inlet membrane (24), means for flowing a sample 

passing through the membrane (24) over an ionisation 
source (26) to an ion reaction region (27), with which 

one or more ion drift regions (10A, 10B) communicate, 
means (30 A1 to 30 A4, 30 B1 to 30 B4) for impressing a 

potential gradient on the or each drift region (10A, 
10B), an ion injection shutter (28A, 28B) at the entrance 

to the or each drift region whereby the drift region can 
be made accessible or inaccessible to ions of a 

particular sign located in the reaction region (27), an 
ion detector (32A, 32B) in the or each drift region, 

means (34A, 34B) for passing drift gas down the or each 
drift region to the reaction region and exit means (22) 

in the reaction region (27) remote from the ionisation 
source (26) for venting drift gas from the reaction 

region (27), a source (25, 46) of alternating potential 
being connected to the ionisation source (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ion mobility detectors. Ion mobility detectors are used to detect the 
presence of materials in an environment, for example 
contaminants in atmospheric air. A library of known 
possible contaminants is built up and the measurements 
known for these are then compared with the results from 
an unknown species to decide whether a sample contains 
a contaminant and if so whether it has already been 
identified. Measurement of concentration or an 
indication of concentration can be given as well as 
qualitative identification of the species. Typical prior art ion mobility detectors have an 
ionisation source, an ion reaction region, an ion drift 
region, e.g. in the form of a tube, an ion injection 
shutter or grid interposed between the ion reaction 
region and the ion drift region, and an ion detector. 
The systems operate at atmospheric pressure where the 
mean free path of the contained gas molecules in the 
drift region is a small fraction of the dimensions of 
the container. A carrier gas, normally purified 
atmospheric air (particularly purified to remove water 
vapour which can interfere with the detection of 
certain types of charged species) is introduced into 
the ion mobility detector with a sample gas or vapour 
of the material whose identity is to be determined by 
characterisation of its ion mobility properties. The 
carrier gas containing the sample is introduced through 
an inlet so as to be exposed to the ionisation source.  
 
This causes portions of both the carrier gas and the 
sample to be directly ionised at the ionisation source. 
The molecules of the carrier gas are present in far 
greater numbers than the sample and so more of these 
are ionised. The gaseous mixture is located within the 
reaction region at this stage and since the mean free 
path is many times smaller than the dimensions of the 
reaction region, multiple collisions between the 
molecules of the carrier and the sample gas(es) occur, 
the result of which is that the ion charge tends to be 
transferred by these collisions from the carrier 
molecules to the sample molecules thus resulting in a 
secondary ionisation process which ionises an increased 
number of the molecules of the sample. The reaction 
region is normally arranged to be under the influence 
of a potential gradient which moves the charged mixture 
towards the ion injection grid which is electrically 
charged to prevent transfer of ions from the reaction 
region to the drift region but which can be deenergised 
so as to let a
