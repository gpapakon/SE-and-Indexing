<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an antistatic
coating composition, a method of making a preferred
antistatic coating composition, and a preferred coating
made from such a composition. The composition includes
an aqueous colloidal dispersion of vanadium oxide.There is a growing interest in antistatic
materials and coatings in various fields of technology,
particularly in the photographic and electronics
industries. Antistatic materials (i.e., antistats) are
electrically conductive materials. They utilize a
conduction process that results in the dissipation of
electrical charges (i.e., "static electricity"). Thus,
it is desirable to use antistats in applications in which
it is necessary to avoid the build-up of electrical
charges, which can discharge suddenly and produce a
detrimental effect. For example, in photographic
applications, an antistatic coating on film avoids sudden
discharges of built-up electrical charge that can cause
undesirable recordation of the associated flash of light.Preferred antistats are those that conduct
electrons by a quantum mechanical mechanism rather than
by an ionic mechanism. This is because antistats that
conduct electrons by a quantum mechanical mechanism are
effective independent of humidity. That is, they are
suitable for use under conditions of low relative
humidity, without losing effectiveness, and under
conditions of high relative humidity, without becoming 
sticky. A major problem, however, with such electron-conducting
antistats is that they generally cannot be
provided as thin, transparent, relatively colorless
coatings by solution coating methods. Although there
have been many attempts to do so, such as by using defect
semiconductor oxide particle dispersions and conductive
polymers, there has been very little success in
overcoming this problem. The use of vanadium oxide has
proven to be the one exception, however. That is,
effective antistatic coatings of vanadium oxide can be
deposited in transparent, substantially colorless thin
films by coating from aqueous dispersions.Three unique properties that distinguish
vanadium oxide from other antistatic materials are its
conduction mechanism, dispersibility, and morphology.
The latter two properties are generally highly dependent
upon the method of synthesis, the first somewhat less so.
The conduction mechanism in vanadium oxide is primarily
a quantum mechanical mechanism known as small polaron
hopping. By this mechanism, electrons are transported
through the material by transmission (i.e., by "hopping")
from one
