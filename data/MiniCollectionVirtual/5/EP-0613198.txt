<ABSTRACT>
To provide a method for treating nonaqueous 
solvent type cells, in particular, a method by which 

lithium cells can be treated and resources can be 
recovered in safe and in a good efficiency, a method 

for recovering resources of lithium cells comprises 
the steps of cutting or boring a lithium cell 

comprised of at least a negative electrode active 
material, a separator, a positive electrode active 

material, an electrolyte solution (electrolytic 
solution), a collector and a cell casing, in an 

ignition preventing means; washing the lithium cell 
thus opened, with an organic solvent to recover the 

electrolytic solution; reacting lithium with a 
reacting agent to recover lithium in the form of 

lithium hydroxide or a lithium salt; carrying out 
filtration to recover the separator, the collector and 

a positive electrode material comprising the positive 
electrode active material; and carrying out 

distillation to recover the organic solvent. This 
makes it possible to safely treat lithium cells having 

been used up, containing organic solvents and metallic 
lithium, and efficiently recover the resources. This 

also makes it easy to recycle lithium cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
treating nonaqueous solvent type cells, and more
particularly to a method by which component materials
constituting lithium-containing cells are safely and
efficiently treated and recovered for their reuse.Recently, in anticipation of the earth
environment that becomes warmer because of greenhouse
effect etc. due to an increase in CO2, it becomes
difficult to construct additional thermal power
stations that discharge CO2 in a large quantity, and
hence it is designed as a means for effectively
utilizing electric generators, to carry out what is
called load levelling, i.e., to accumulate nighttime
power in secondary cells (storage cells) installed at
general homes so that loads can be levelled and the
power can be efficiently used. There is also an
increase in demand for the development of secondary
cells with a high energy density used for electric
automobiles discharging no air pollution substances,
and demand for high-performance secondary cells used
in power sources for portable machinery such as 
notebook personal computers or word processors, video
cameras and portable telephones.As the above high-performance secondary cells,
rocking chair type lithium ion cells making use of a
positive electrode active material comprising lithium
ions introduced as an interlayer compound and a
negative electrode active material comprising carbon
have gained a progress in development, and some of
them are being put into practical use. Researches and
development are also accelerated in respect of lithium
secondary cells making use of a negative electrode
active material comprising metallic lithium, having a
higher energy density than the lithium ion cells. In
future, lithium cells are expected to be used over a
wide range of from the above portable machinery power
sources to electric automobiles, load conditioners and
power storage.Lithium cells making use of metallic lithium
in the negative electrode, having been put into
practical use as primary cells, have a very high
energy density and hence have been used in large
number in portable machinery such as cameras and wrist
watches. They, however, are still in small number
when compared with the total amount of the cells under
consumption. Lithium cells formed into secondary
cells can be repeatedly used and the quantity 
according to their use may decrease. However, with an
expansion in their use as stated above, lithium-containing
cells including lithium ion cells are
expected to be used in an increasing amount
