<ABSTRACT>
A plasma addressed liquid display device includes a 
liquid crystal chamber having row-shaped signal electrodes, 

and a plasma chamber having column-shaped discharge channels 
and overlapped on the liquid crystal chamber. A scanning 

circuit sequentially applies a selective pulse to a cathode 
within a pair of plasma electrodes so as to excite gas atoms 

filled into the discharge channels from the ground state to 
the metastable state, so that the line sequential scanning 

operation is carried out. A drive circuit sequentially 
applies a data pulse to each of the signal electrodes in 

synchronism with this line sequential scanning operation, so 
that a desirable image display is performed. The operations 

of the scanning circuit and the drive circuit are so 
controlled as to satisfy a predetermined time sequential 

relationship t₁ 
<
 t₂ 
<
 t₃. It should be noted that t₁ 
indicates a time instant when the release of the applied 

selective pulse is complete, t₂ denotes a time instant when 
the recovery of the gas atoms to the ground state is 

complete, and t₃ shows a time instant when the release of the 
applied data pulse is complete. The unnecessary DC bias 

voltage is applied to the liquid crystal chamber by 
satisfying this time sequential relationship, whereby it is 

possible to prevent a display image from being burned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasma addressed
liquid crystal display device having a flat panel structure
in which liquid crystal chambers are mutually overlapped on
plasma chambers. More specifically, the present invention
concerns an optimum technique of line sequential drive timing
for a plasma addressed liquid crystal display device.Referring now to Fig. 3, a general structure of the
conventional plasma addressed liquid crystal display device
will be briefly explained. It should be noted that the
plasma addressed liquid crystal display device is disclosed
in, for instance, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
1-217396, corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,077,553. This conventional plasma addressed liquid crystal display device is also known from figure 1 and corresponding description of DE 42 23 305 A. As
shown in this drawing, this liquid crystal display device
includes a flat panel structure constructed of a liquid
crystal chamber 101, a plasma chamber 102, and a common
intermediate sheet 103 interposed between the liquid crystal
chamber and the plasma chamber. The plasma chamber 102 is
fabricated by employing a lower-sided glass substrate 104, 
and a stripe-shaped groove 105 is formed on a surface of the
glass substrate 104. This groove 105 extends along, for
example, a row direction of a matrix. The respective grooves
105 are tightly sealed by the intermediate sheet 103 to
constitute discharge channels 106 which are individually
separated from each other. Excitable gas atoms are filled
into the tightly sealed discharge channels 106. A convex
portion 107 for separating the adjacent grooves 105 has a
role of a separating wall for sectioning the respective
discharge channels 106. A pair of plasma electrodes 108 and
109 being positioned in parallel to each other are provided
on a curved bottom portion of each of the grooves 105. These
plasma electrodes function as an anode "A" and a cathode "K",
which may excite gas atoms contained in the discharge channel
106 to be brought into the metastable state, so that plasma
is produced. This discharge channel 106 becomes a unit of
row scanning operation. On the other hand, the liquid
crystal chamber 101 is constructed by employing an upper-sided
glass substrate 110. This glass substrate 110 is
positioned opposite to the intermediate sheet 103 via a
predetermined space into which a liquid crystal layer 111 is
held. On the inner surface of the glass substrate, a signal
electrode D made of a transparent conductive film is formed
in a stripe shape.
