<ABSTRACT>
A polymer alignment 
liquid crystal display device 

(Reverse PDLC), in which 
haze is reduced and contrast 

is improved and which can be 
applied to various fields using 

active elements and a color filter. 
An electronic apparatus having 

a completely new value in a 
combination of such a reverse 

PDLC and an electronic device. 
When this display device is 

used in combination with a 
solar battery in which haze is a 

serious problem, an appropriate 
amount of dichroic dye is added 

to the liquid crystal so as not 
to allow the polymer to emit 

any fluorescence, or a chiral 
polymer precursor is used. Also, 

the reverse PDLC is used for 
an electronic apparatus. In this 

way, haze becomes unnoticeable, 
and a sufficient contrast can be 

obtained. This display device can 
be superposed on a solar battery 

or another display device, and an 
extremely compact display device 

and electronic apparatus can be 
fabricated by incorporating a solar 

battery or another displace device 
in the display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reflective type of
bright display element useful for displays of wrist watches,
meter panels of automobiles, information apparatus
terminals of electronic memorandum books, computers and
televisions, or information bulletin boards, and to the
construction and composition of an electronic apparatus
using the same.There have been developed various kinds of wrist
watches, such as analogue-type watches with pointers,
digital-type watches equipped with liquid crystal display
elements. In recently, in addition to said types of
watches, because of diversification of the information to
be displayed, have been developed hybrid-type watches
equipped with small window of liquid crystal, and two-layer-type
watches in which liquid crystal display element 
is superposed on the surface of analogue-type watch with
pointers (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos.
94940/1979, 136718/1979, 26986/1980, 46845/1980,
188786/1980, 23024/1981 and 65618/1981). In the field of
watch and electronic memorandum books, there have now been
developed various kinds of multifunctional-type ones
carrying various kinds of functions. For these use, the
development of a novel type of display element which may be
a "new leader" of watches has been expected.On the other hand, displays of electronic apparatuses
for special use, for example a meter panel of automobile,
are needed to display various kinds of information on a
limited space. Furthermore, particularly in meter panel of
automobile, the display mode to be employed should be
selected from either analogue type or digital type.On addition, in the field of information apparatus
involving watches, the current trend has been going toward
the compact and portable type, resulting in increasing
demand for saving in electric power of the display element
to be mounted them. In such portable information display
apparatuses or information processing apparatuses,
batteries have conventionally been used and, therefore, the
lifetime of batteries to be used is an extremely important
factor in use. From this viewpoint, apparatuses 
incorporating with a solar battery have recently been
developed. In an apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 61930/1991, for example, a liquid crystal
display element and a solar battery are superposed on each
other in order to provide space-saving of the apparatus.
In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 106725/1988
and so on, there are disclosed an apparatus having a
structure in which a solar battery is
