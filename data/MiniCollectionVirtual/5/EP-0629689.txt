adhesion and low temperature pumpability properties, which comprises 


(a) from 50 to 98 wt%, based on grease, of a lubricating oil; 
(b) from 1 to 30 wt%, based on grease, of a thickener; and 
(c) from 0.5 to 2.0 wt%, based on grease of polymer selected from 
either a defined block copolymer of the structure A-B, or a 

hydrogenated star-shaped polymer having a poly(divinylbenzene) nucleus 
and at least seven hydrogenated polyisoprene arms linked to said 

nucleus. 
 
 
The grease has an apparent viscosity of less than about 3500 
poise (350 Pa.s) at 20 sec⁻¹.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grease composition having improved 
adhesion and water resistance. Many greases are subjected to operating conditions wherein 
the grease is exposed to an aqueous environment. Aqueous environments 
are detrimental to grease performance because of problems such as 
leaching of water soluble components and reduced adhesion. The use of 
polymers to impart desirable properties to greases is well-known. For 
example, a presentation by G. D. Hussey at the October, 1986 NLGI 
meeting in San Diego, California, discussed the alteration of grease 
characteristics using new generation polymers. However, many polymers 
must be incorporated at relatively high concentrations in order to 
impact the desired properties. This can lead to other problems such 
as poor pumpability, especially at low temperatures. It would be desirable to have a polymer additive to greases 
which has good water resistance and adhesion properties at low concentrations 
while at the same time producing a grease with good pumpability. This invention relates to a grease composition having improved 
water resistance, adhesion and low temperature pumpability 
properties which comprises: 
(a) from 50 to 90 wt%, based on grease of a lubricating oil; (b) from 1 to 30 wt%, based on grease of a thickener; and (c) from 0.5 to 2.0 wt%, based on grease of polymer selected 
from the group consisting of (1) a block copolymer of the structure 
A-B where A is a polymer block comprising at least about 75 percent by 
weight of condensed styrene units, no more than 25 percent of the  
 
aromatic unsaturation in said block being reduced by hydrogenation and 
B is hydrogenated polymer block comprising, prior to hydrogenation, at 
least 75 percent by weight of condensed isoprene units, at least 95 
percent of the olefinic unsaturation in said block being reduced by 
hydrogenation, and (2) a hydrogenated star-shaped polymer having a 
poly(divinylbenzene) nucleus and at least seven hydrogenated polyisoprene 
arms linked to said nucleus; wherein the grease has an apparent viscosity of less than about 3500 
poise (350 Pa.s) at 20 sec⁻¹. Suitably the total of (a) + (b) + (c) will be over 60 wt.% of 
the grease composition, normally at least 80 wt.%, preferably either 
at least 85 wt.% or at least 90 wt.%. A wide variety of lubricating oils can be employed in preparing 
the grease compositions of the present invention. Accordingly, 
the lubricating oil base can be any of the conventionally used mineral 
oils, synthetic hydrocarbon oils or
