<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
a dispersion of a water-soluble polymer which is widely 
used as, e.g. flocculating agents for waste water treatment, 
dehydrating agents, chemicals used in papermaking 
processes, dispersion dispersants for various suspensions, 
soil improvers, etc. and for preparing dispersions of cationic 
vinyl addition polymers in an aqueous salt solution. Conventional processes for the preparation of a water 
soluble cationic polymer which is useful as a flocculant for 
waste water disposal or as a papermaking chemical include  
 
standing polymerization in an aqueous solution, water-in-oil 
emulsion polymerization, and suspension polymerization in a 
hydrophobic solvent. Others have prepared a water soluble, nonionic or 
anionic polymer by precipitation polymerization in an 
aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate. Still others have 
carried out the polymerization in an aqueous solution of 
salt in the presence of a polyhydric alcohol or a 
polyelectrolyte as a dispersant. US-A-4 929 655 discloses a process for preparing a water 
soluble polymer dispersion which overcomes the many 
disadvantages of the stationary polymerization, water-in-oil 
type emulsion polymerization and suspension polymerization 
processes. This process for the production of a water 
soluble polymer dispersion includes the polymerization of 
water soluble monomers of 5 to 100 mole % of a cationic 
monomer represented by the following formula (I), 0 to 50 
mole % of another cationic monomer represented by the 
following formula (II) and 0 to 95 mole % of 
(meth)acrylamide in the presence of 1 to 10% by weight of an 
organic high molecular multivalent cation comprising a water 
soluble polymer containing at least a monomer of formula 
(II) (i.e., a hydrophilic monomer), based on the total 
weight of the monomers, in an aqueous multivalent anionic 
salt solution having a concentration of 15% by weight or 
more:  
 
 
where R1 is either hydrogen or CH3; R2 and R3 are each an 
alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms; A1 is either an 
oxygen atom or NH; B1 is either an alkylene group having 2 
to 4 carbon atoms or a hydroxypropylene group, and X1⊖ is an 
anionic counterion, and optionally a second cationic monomer 
represented by the following general formula (II): 
 
where R4 is either hydrogen or CH3; R5 and R6 are each an 
alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms; R7 is a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms; A2 is 
either an oxygen atom or NH; B2 is either an alkylene
