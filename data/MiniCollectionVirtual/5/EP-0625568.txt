<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning 
solution for apparatuses used for producing quinone 
diazide photosensitizers, apparatuses used for preparation 
of positive resist solutions containing the quinone 
diazide photosensitizers, or spin coater line pipings 
(apparatuses for coating positive resist solutions used 
for making integrated circuits, etc.) and a cleaning 
method using the cleaning solution. With recent increase in the degree of 
integration of LSI devices, the design rule of 
integrated circuits has become finer from about 1 µm to 
0.5 µm. Positive resist solutions (comprising an 
alkali-soluble resin, a quinone diazide photosensitizer 
and a solvent) used for such fine processing are 
required to have good basic performances (such as 
resolution, sensitivity, profile, coatability and depth 
of focus) and in addition are required to contain less 
fine particles. That is, when a substrate is subjected 
to etching using a resist pattern prepared from a 
positive resist solution containing many fine particles 
which are visually unobservable, unevenness in coating 
sometimes occurs in the portions of the substrate which  
 
are covered with the resist pattern to cause decrease in 
the yield in making integrated circuits. On the other hand, according to the research 
conducted by the inventors, it has been elucidated that 
the fine particles result mainly from the quinone 
diazide photosensitizers (such as 1,2-benzoquinone 
diazide-4-sulfonate ester, 1,2-naphtoquinone diazide-4-sulfonic 
ester, 1,2-naphthoquinone diazide-5-sulfonate 
ester, etc.). When the kind of quinone diazide photosensitizer 
to be produced is changed to another kind of 
quinone diazide photosensitizer, usually a small amount 
of the photosensitizer previously produced remains in 
the empty apparatus after the product photosensitizer 
has been drawn out therefrom. Therefore, the apparatus 
must be cleaned with a solvent such as acetone before 
starting of the production of the another photosensitizer. 
However, only the cleaning with a solvent 
such as acetone does not necessarily afford a sufficient 
cleaning efficiency and the fine particles and undesirable 
components coming from the fine particles remain 
in the apparatus. Moreover, in preparing a positive 
resist solution, when the kind of the resist solution to 
be prepared is changed to another kind of resist solution, 
a small amount of the resist solution previously 
prepared remains in the empty apparatus after the resist 
solution prepared has been drawn
