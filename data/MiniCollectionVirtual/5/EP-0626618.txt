<ABSTRACT>
A film developing apparatus includes a loading section (4) for 
receiving a film 

holder (2), a developing section (6), a film transport device (11,22) 
for transporting a film 

protruding from a film feed opening of the film holder to the 
developing section, 

and a film drawing device (5) for drawing a leader of the film in the 
film holder 

mounted in the loading section, out through the film feed opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to film developing apparatus, and more
particularly to a film developing apparatus having a loading section for receiving
a film holder, a developing section, and a film transport device for transporting
a film protruding from a film feed opening of the film holder to the developing
section.With the above film developing apparatus as known e.g. from DE-A-38 33 489, a film to be developed is placed
together with its holder in the loading section, and the film transport device
transports the film protruding from the film feed opening of the holder to the
developing section.To enable the transport device to transport the film, the leader of the film
must protrude from the film feed opening. For this purpose, a special device
has been used heretofore as e.g. known from DE-A-29 23 992 to draw the leader of the film from inside the film
holder. After the leader is drawn out by the special device, the film holder is
placed in the loading section of the film developing apparatus.Thus, a film developing process involves an operation to transfer the film
holder from the special device for drawing the leader of the film to the film
developing apparatus. This results in a low operating efficiency.To overcome this disadvantage it is known from EP-A-531 235 to include an extracting unit into a developing apparatus.The present invention has been made having regard to the state of the art
noted above, and its object is to improve the efficiency of the film developing
process. The above object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by a film
developing apparatus comprising the features according to claim 1.With this construction, the film drawing device draws the leader of the film
from the film holder mounted in the loading section, so that the leader protrudes
from the film feed opening of the holder. Thereafter the film transport device
transports and guides the film from the film feed opening to the developing section to
develop the film.Thus, the film developing apparatus may receive in the loading section a
film holder having the leader of a film not protruding from the film feed opening
thereof. The film may be developed without requiring transfer of the film
holder after the film leader is drawn out of the film holder. This apparatus,
therefore, is capable of an efficient film developing process.The film developing apparatus may include a detecting device for detecting
whether the leader of the film protrudes from the film holder mounted in the
loading section. In this

<CLAIMS>
A film developing apparatus comprising:

a loading section (4) for receiving a film holder (2) holding a film (3);
a developing section (6) for developing said film (3);
film transport means (T) for transporting said film (3) protruding from a film feed
opening (2b) of said film holder (2) to said developing section (6)

characterised in that it comprises

a film guide (50) for guiding the film (3) drawn from said film holder (2);
film drawing means (P) for drawing a leader of said film (3) in said film holder
(2) mounted in said loading section (4), out through said film feed opening (2b);

said film drawing means (P) including

upper and lower leader pinch plates (51, 52) for together pinching the film (3)
therebetween to draw the film (3) from said film holder (2),
drive means (M2) for driving said upper leader pinch (51) from the outside of
film holder (2) to the inside thereof;
further drive means (M3) for driving said lower pinch plate (52) from the outside
of said film holder (2) to the inside thereof and
a control unit (C) capable of selectively providing a state where said film guide
(50) is positioned at a height where the film (3) is to be transported and a further

state where said upper and lower leader pinch plates (51, 52) are positioned at
said height.
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 1,

characterized in that

said film transport means (T) includes rollers (11, 22) for transporting said film
(3) to said developing section (6), and means (M6) for driving said rollers (11,

22).
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 1,

characterized in that

said loading section (4) includes drive means (M1) for
rotating a spool (2a) of said film holder (2). 
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 3,

characterized in that

said loading section (4) includes a detecting sensor (43) comprising an optical
sensor for detecting presence of said film holder (2), and flapping sound detecting

sensor (44) for detecting a flapping sound made by said leader of the film
(3).
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 1,

characterized by

a film cutter (21) disposed between said loading section (4) and said upper and
lower leader pinch plates (51, 52) for cutting said film (3) when said film (3) has

been drawn out of said film holder (2).
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 1,

characterized by

detecting means (60) for detecting whether said leader of said film (3) protrudes
from said film holder (2) mounted in said loading section (4); and
said film drawing means (P) being operable to draw said film (3) when said
detecting means (60) fails to detect said leader.
A film developing apparatus as defined in claim 6,

characterized in that

said detecting means (60) is an optical sensor.
A method for retrieving a film from a film holder within a film developing apparatus
according to one or more of the claims 1 - 7 comprising the following

steps:

loading a film holder into a loading section of a film developing apparatus;
inserting a film retrieval element into the film holder by inserting first and second
flexible, resilient pinch plates into the film holder with a distal end of the

first pinch plate positioned against an outside wall of the film holder and a distal
end of the second pinch plate positioned between the first pinch plate and the

film; 
gripping the film within the film holder by the film retrieval element;
pulling the film from the film holder by the film retrieval element; and
directing the film along a film path for development within the film developing
apparatus.
The method according to claim 8

wherein the gripping step is carried out by:

rotating the film in a first rotary direction within the film holder until an outer film
end past the distal end of the second pinch plate;
rotating the film in a second rotary direction; and
advancing the distal end of the second pinch plate until the film is secured between
the first and second pinch plates.
