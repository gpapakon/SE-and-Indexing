<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method for strengthening a cellulosic substrate 
by treating the substrate with a formaldehyde-free curable aqueous composition and 

curing the composition. The cellulosic substrates include, for example, paper oil- and air-filter 
stock, rayon nonwoven wipes, cellulosic laminating stock, cotton woven fabrics, 

and wood flakes suitable to be consolidated into flakeboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to strengthening a cellulosic substrate.
Suitable substrates include, for example, paper oil- and air-filter stock,
nonwoven wipes, polyester/cotton woven fabrics, cellulosic laminating stock,
nonwoven cellulosic felts, and wood fibers and flakes consolidated into or
suitable to be consolidated into fiberboard, hardboard, particleboard, and oriented
strand board.Substrates composed predominantly of cellulosic materials are frequently
advantageously strengthened by treatment with a polymeric composition. The
treatment with a polymeric composition may also provide reduced sensitivity to
moisture vapor or water or solvents in addition to reinforcement of the
substrate. Furthermore, the polymeric composition should not substantially
detract from essential substrate characteristics, as might be the case, for example,
if the cured composition were too rigid or brittle or became sticky under
processing conditions. Additionally, the polymeric composition should wet out
and penetrate preformed cellulosic webs and mats.US-A-5,042,986 discloses an aqueous treating solution for cellulosic
textiles. The treating solution contains a cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon of 4 to 6
carbon atoms having 4 or more carboxyl groups, wherein at least two adjacent
carboxyl groups are in the trans configuration relative to each other. The treating
solution includes a suitable curing agent which is the alkali metal dihydrogen
phosphate or the alkali metal salt of phosphorous, hypophosphorous, and
polyphosphoric acid. The treating process is disclosed to be advantageously used
with textiles containing 30-100% cellulosic materials.US-A-4,820,307; 4,936,865; and 4,975,209 disclose catalysts for the rapid
formaldehyde-free esterification and crosslinking of fibrous cellulose in textile
form by polycarboxylic acids including saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic acids,
as well as alpha-hydroxyacids. The catalysts disclosed are acidic or weakly basic
salts selected from the alkali metal dihydrogen phosphates and alkali 
metal salts of phosphorous, hypophosphorous, and polyphosphoric acids.US-A-4,795,533 discloses a solid electrolyte membrane which contains a
three component blend prepared by admixing an organic polymer, such as
polyvinyl alcohol, with an inorganic compound and a polyorganic acid, such as
polyacrylic acid. The inorganic compound is disclosed to be selected from a
group consisting of phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, heteropoly acids, or salts of
heteropoly acids. Examples of phosphoric acids which may be

Use of a formaldehyde-free curable aqueous composition for increasing at least one of
dry tensile strength, water-wet tensile strength, solvent wet tensile strength,

delamination resistance, stiffness and modulus of rupture of a cellulosic substrate, said
composition comprising (a) a polyacid containing at least two carboxylic acid groups,

the salts thereof, or anhydride groups, wherein said polyacid is an addition polymer
having a molecular weight from 300 to

10,000,000

accelerator, wherein said carboxyl groups or anhydride groups are
neutralized to an extent of less than 35% with a fixed base, wherein said fixed

base is a monovalent base which is non-volatile when applied to the
substrate and heated from 120 to 400째C; with the proviso that the cellulosic substrate is

not rayon.
The use of claim 1 wherein said curable aqueous composition further comprises at
least one active hydrogen compound comprising at least two active hydrogen groups

selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, primary amino, second amino, and
mixtures thereof; wherein the ratio of the number of equivalents of said carboxylic

acid groups, salts thereof, or anhydride groups, to the number of equivalents of said
active hydrogen groups is from 1/0 01 to 1/3.
The use of claims 1 and 2, wherein said polyacid comprises a copolymer prepared by
emulsion polymerization of at least two ethylenically unsaturated monomers and

contains at least two carboxylic acid groups, the salts thereof, or anhydride groups,
wherein said copolymer has a Tg between 60째C and 50째C. 
Use of a formaldehyde-free curable aqueous composition for increasing at least one of dry

stock, polyester/cotton woven fabrics, cellulosic laminating stock, nonwoven cellulosic felts, and wood
