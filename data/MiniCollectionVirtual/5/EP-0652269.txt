<ABSTRACT>
Binder for coating composition based on film-forming latices prepared from unsaturated ethylenic monomers, characterised in that the said binder comprises, per 100 parts by weight of latex A (calculated on the basis of the solids content) which has a particle size of between 100 and 500 nm, from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of latex B (calculated on the basis of the solids content) which has a particle size of between 5 and 40 nm. Use of the above binder for the preparation of paper-coating compositions, varnishes and paints, adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives and the like.
