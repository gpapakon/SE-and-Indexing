<ABSTRACT>
Load transfer members for osteosynthesis embodied as bone fixating means and load carriers with a coupling device, as well as surgical instruments in which a nominal breaking point is integrated in the shaft at one point. This nominal breaking point ensures that that part of the load transfer member that remains in the bone has a section which is intended to facilitate removal and projects over the bone surface and on which an actuation member can engage in the event of an overload fracture of the load transfer member; this section can preferably also include a handle.

device for coupling to other osteosynthetic aids, 

wherein the load transfer member comprises a 
predetermined breaking point located when in use between 

the coupling device and the bone and lying outside the 
bone mass and, in the case of breakage of the load 

transfer member at the predetermined breaking point, 
comprises a segment projecting beyond the bone surface 

and permitting direct engagement of an actuating tool.

the load transfer member at the predetermined breaking 

point, comprises a segment (19, 31, 52) projecting

of an actuating tool. 
A load transfer member according to claim 2, 
characterised in that at least part of the shank is 

constructed as a fixing means engaging in the bone, such

(32), a screw insert, nail, wire or prosthesis 

component. 
A load transfer member according to claim 2,

osteosynthetic implant located outside the bone or lying 
thereon, such as a bone plate (21), a rod (52), a tube, 

a wire or a clip.

preceding claims, characterised in that at least a first 

handling element (15, 31) is formed for an actuating 
tool. 
A load transfer member according to claim 5,

end face (47) suitable for the exertion of pressure.

is formed for an actuating tool. 
A load transfer member according to any one of claims 5 
to 7, characterised in that at least one handling 

element has a cross section (31) deviating from the 
purely circular and a load transfer and driving segment. 
A load transfer member according to claim 8, 
characterised in that at least one handling element 

comprises two driving segments (15, 16). 
A load transfer member according to claim 9, 
characterised in that at least one driving segment is 

conical or spherical in form. 
A load transfer member according to any one of the  
 

preceding claims, characterised in that the 
predetermined breaking point is formed by material 

weakening, such as notching, segmental cross-sectional 
reduction (35) or constriction (17). 
A load transfer member according to claim 2 or any of 
the preceding claims dependent on claim 2, characterised 

in that the predetermined breaking point is formed by 
cross-sectional undersizing in a load transfer member 

located outside the bone and acting as an implant 
component (52).

of the preceding claims dependent on claim 2, said 

member forming, with other load transfer components, an 
implant system composed of several components, 

characterised in that an implant component comprises a 
prominent edge (50) in the contact area, which edge (50) 

has a notching effect on the shank of the load transfer 
member (53) during assembly and thereby generates a 

predetermined breaking point on the load transfer 
member.
