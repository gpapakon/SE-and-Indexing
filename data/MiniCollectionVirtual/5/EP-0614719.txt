<ABSTRACT>
A mounting structure for a cutting blade in a 
dicing apparatus in which a mounted blade is rotated in 

a well-balanced condition and further the blade can be 
easily attached to and detached from the apparatus. The 

mounting structure of the invention comprises a mount 
(3) including a first cylindrical engagement portion 

(31), and a first screw portion (33); a cutting blade 
(4) including a second engagement portion (43) engaging 

with a first engagement portion (31); and a screw member 
(5) including a second screw portion (51) being screwed 

into the first screw portion (33) so that the screw 
member (5) presses the cutting blade (4) against the 

flange surface (32) for fixation, the mount (3) further 
including a third cylindrical engagement portion (36), 

and the screw member (5) including a fourth engagement 
portion (52) engaging with the third engagement portion 

(36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mounting
structure for a cutting blade of a dicing apparatus
which conducts narrow-groove cutting and in which a
cutting blade, in which abrasive grains made of diamond
and other materials are fixed with nickel, is rotated at
high speed.A dicing apparatus is used for forming narrow
grooves and separating a semiconductor wafer into IC
chips
(see for example EP-A-0 131 809).
The blade of the dicing apparatus is a disk-shaped
rotary blade made of abrasive grains of diamond
which are fixed with nickel. The thickness of the outer
portion of the cutting blade is several tens of microns.
This blade is rotated by a spindle motor at high speed
so as to cut narrow grooves. Therefore, an end portion
of the blade wears away when the grooves are formed.
Accordingly, it is necessary to replace the blade in
accordance with the processing. For this reason, it is
arranged that the blade portion can be attached to and
detached from the spindle motor. In the dicing
apparatus, the spindle motor is rotated at high speed.
Therefore, it is necessary that the spindle motor is
well-balanced when the blade is attached to the spindle
motor. Consequently, a rotational center of the
spindle motor and that of the blade are made to coincide
with each other using an engagement structure so that
the spindle motor is well-balanced. In the structure
in which the blade is mounted, the mount is engaged
with the spindle shaft, and then fixed with a nut.In the blade mounting structure described above,
all the operator must do is to engage the blade with the
mount so as to fix it. Therefore, the blade can be
easily replaced. In this case, the accuracy of a 
position of the center of the blade is determined by
the accuracy of an engagement portion of the mount and
the blade, and the perpendicularity of the blade with
respect to the rotational shaft is determined by the
accuracy of the flange and blade surfaces. Therefore,
when the machining accuracy of the engagement portions
of the flange surface and blade surface is improved,
the blade 4 can be accurately attached to the mount. A problem is caused when the workability of
the blade detaching operation is improved, which will
be described as follows: When the blade is mounted in
the manner described above, the rotational balance is
determined by an amount of gap of the engaging portion,
that is, the rotational balance is determined by a
tolerance of the gap. The smaller the tolerance of the
engaging portion is reduced, the better the rotational
balance is
