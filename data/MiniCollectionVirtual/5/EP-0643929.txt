<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a crotch and hip joint 
protection garment of a breeches-shape or a pants-shape 

having hem portions of the leg parts below the wearer's hip 
joint regions and a protection pad in the vicinity of the 

wearer's crotch region. The protection pad (4) comprises a 
base pad made of non-woven fabric or an open-cell flexible 

polyurethane foam and a pad cover made of a knit or a non-woven 
fabric covering the base pad. The protection pad (4) 

extends and covers from the crotch region to at least the 
region below the wearer's hip joint regions toward the hem 

portions, to provide a garment to protect the wearer's 
crotch and hip joint regions which is not liable to cause 

pain or abrasion by the friction between the garment and 
the skin of the wearer. The garment can provide improved 

wearing comfort with its good ventilation and less 
stuffiness, and therefore, is appropriate for the sports 

application including bicycling, motorcycling and 
horseriding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to crotch and hip joint 
protection garments, and more specifically to a crotch and 
hip joint protection garment which is applicable for 
various sports activities such as bicycling, motorcycling 
and horseback riding. Protection garments comprising breeches (short pants) 
or pants (longer ones) with protection pads sewn to the 
inside covering over the crotch region in the vicinity of 
the pubis in the front to the coccyx in the back, for 
alleviating impact to the crotch region, have been used for 
bicycle sports, such as triathron, various bicycle races, 
or bicycling. There has not been any garment capable of alleviating 
impact given during motor-cycling activities such as moto-cross 
or motor-cycle races, and therefore garments for 
bicycle sports have often been used in motor-cycling as 
well. For equestrian sports such as horseback riding, an 
inner garment designed to ease impact has not been on the  
 
market but only such riding pants having leather patchs to 
prevent abrasion of fabric have been available. Thus inner 
garments for everyday use or protection garments for 
bicycling have often been used. Moreover, for sports such as car rally in which people 
do not have to ride astride saddles but possibly have their 
crotch parts come in contact with the vehicle, or the 
vicinity of right and left upper regio femoris medialis 
regions chafe each other by pedaling actions, protection 
garments with protection pads capable of alleviating impact 
during the sports practice have not been available so far. Prior products can be explained with an example of a 
spats-type breeches for bicycling. In general, a 
protection pad which covers in the vicinity of the pubis 
region in the front and to the vicinity of the coccyx 
region in the back and approximately over the crotch part 
widthwise is attached to the garment body by seaming at its 
circumference with the thread exposed to the skin side. FIGs. 24-27 illustrate a concrete example of a typical 
breeches-type (short-pants type) protection garment 
available on the market. FIG. 24 is a schematic plan view from the front side 
(a schematic plan view provided that the garment is folded 
in two along the side lines almost evenly), FIG. 25 is a  
 
schematic plan view from the back side (folded in the same 
way as Fig. 24), FIG. 26 is a schematic plan view seen from 
a side (a schematic plan view seen from a side provided 
that the garment is folded in such a way as when the pants 
are pressed by a pants-presser) and
