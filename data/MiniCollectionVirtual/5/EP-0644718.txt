<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous removal of cholesterol from a feed oil which comprises (a) wet milling a raw oil having an elevated cholesterol level with an extraction oil whereby there is formed a mixture of the raw oil and extraction oil; (b) centrifuging said mixture to yield a first fraction low in cholesterol, said first fraction being suited for incorporation into a foodstuff, and a second fraction which is an oil feed having a high level of cholesterol; (c) introducing said oil feed at a temperature of at least about 400  DEG F (204.4  DEG C) at an upper portion of a countercurrent thin-film steam stripper while simultaneously introducing steam at a lower portion thereof, wherein said countercurrent thin-film steam stripper is internally configured with sufficient active surface area so that it is capable under appropriate operating flow conditions of temperature, pressure and steam flow rates to remove at least 65 % cholesterol from a cholesterol containing oil, said countercurrent thin-film steam stripper being continuously maintained at a pressure of at least about 1 mmHg and a temperature of at least about 400  DEG F (204.4 DEG C), whereby there is produced a two-phase exit flow therefrom comprising a liquid phase containing oil with reduced level of cholesterol and a vapor phase rich in cholesterol; (d) and recycling said liquid phase as an extraction oil for said wet milling.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OF LOW CHOLESTEROL OILThis application incorporates by reference the entire text of Marschner & Fine, U.S. Patent 4,996,072, granted Feb. 26, 1991, "Physical Process for the Deodorization and/or Cholesterol Reduction of Fats and Oils", including the entire specification and all drawings.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a method for treating fats and oils for cholesterol level reduction.2. BackgroundThe prior art comprises Bracco et al., U.S. Patent4,333,959, "Decholesterization of Egg Yolk", which discloses colloidal mixing of an oil to be treated and a recycle oil.Such known techniques in the prior art with colloidal mixing are not a part of the present invention.The present invention relates to an improvement in the general process for reducing the level of cholesterol in an oil feed taught by Marschner & Fine, U.S. Patent 4,996,072, granted Feb. 26, 1991. The Marschner & Fine process comprises steps (c) and (d) listed below in the first paragraph under the heading "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION". 

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIGS. 1 and IA are as set forth in the aforementioned and incorporated-by-reference text of U.S. Patent 4,996,072 and comprise a schematic flow chart diagram of one embodiment of the first aspect of the present invention.UNITS OF MEASUREMENTThroughout the specification and claims, percentages and ratios are by weight and temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsuis unless otherwise indicated.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a process for the continuous removal of cholesterol from a feed oil which comprises. (a) wet milling a raw oil having an elevated cholesterol level with an extraction oil whereby there is formed a mixture of the raw oil and extraction oil; (b) centrifuging said mixture to yield a first fraction low in cholesterol, said first fraction being suited for incorporation into a foodstuff, and a second fraction which is an oil feed having a high level of cholesterol; (c) introducing said oil feed at a temperature of at least about 400* F. (204.4β C.) (204.4β C.) at an upper portion of a countercurrent thin-film steam stripper while simultaneously introducing steam at a lower portion thereof, wherein said countercurrent thin film steam stripper is internally configured with sufficient active surface area so that it is capable under appropriate operating flow conditions of temperature, pressure and steam flow rates to remove at least 65 % cholesterol from

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for the continuous removal of cholesterol from a feed oil which comprises (a) wet milling a raw oil having an elevated cholesterol level with an extraction oil whereby there is formed a mixture of the raw oil and extraction oil; (b) centrifuging said mixture to yield a first fraction low in cholesterol, said first fraction being suited for incorporation into a foodstuff, and a second fraction which is an oil feed having a high level of cholesterol; (c) introducing said oil feed at a temperature of at least about 400* F. (204.4
*
 C.) at an upper portion of a countercurrent thin-film steam stripper while simultaneously introducing steam at a lower portion thereof, wherein said countercurrent thin film steam stripper is internally configured with sufficient active surface area so that it is capable under appropriate operating flow conditions of temperature, pressure and steam flow rates to remove at least 65 % cholesterol from a cholesterol containing oil, said countercurrent thin-film steam stripper being continuously maintained at a pressure of at least about 1 mmHg and a temperature of at least about 400* F. (204.4* C), whereby there is produced a two phase exit flow therefrom comprising a liquid phase containing oil with reduced level of cholesterol and a vapor phase rich in cholesterol; (d) and recycling said liquid phase as an extraction oil for said wet milling.
2. A process of claim 1 wherein said first fraction is incorporated into a foodstuff.
3. A process of claim 1 wherein said raw oil is wet egg yolk, whereby there is produced said first fraction which is a lowered cholesterol component of egg yolk. 


 4. A process of claim 1 wherein said method is operated under conditions to remove at least fifty percent of the cholesterol from said oil feed.
5. A process of claim 1 wherein a vegetable oil is included in said wet milling and forms a component of the recycled oil and the feed oil.
6. A process of claim 1 wherein at least 65 % of the cholesterol is removed from said feed oil.
7. A process of claim 1 wherein an animal oil is included in said wet milling and forms a component of the recycled oil and the feed oil.
8. A process of claim 1 wherein said animal oil is chicken fat.
