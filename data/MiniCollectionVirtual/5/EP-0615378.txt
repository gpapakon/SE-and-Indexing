<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a projection-exposure 
section for projecting and exposing a film image onto 

a photosensitive material, an image-exposure section 
for exposing the photosensitive material based on 

exposing image information with setting an exposure 
amount for each of a plurality of areas of the 

exposing image information, and a reader device for 
reading the image information of the film image with 

the image information being divided into the plurality 
of areas. The image-exposure section generates the 

exposing image information through composition of the 
plurality of areas of the image information read by 

the reader device, image information stored in advance 
in the image-exposure section and of further image 

information inputted from another input device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer, according to the preamble of claim 1.
This image printer is known from
JP-A-02 103 524 (Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, no. 317, (P-1037).
09 July 1990).According to the above-mentioned type of image
printer, the projection-exposure of the film image may
be effected at a high speed at the projection-exposure
section. Whereas, the image-exposure section may
effect such special processing as image composition
though at a lower speed since this image-exposure
section has to process the information of the great 
number of areas.As the image composition processing, there is
known the art of effecting double-exposure, i.e. the
projection-exposure of the film image at the
projection-exposure section and the further exposure
of e.g. character data at the image-exposure section
in an overlapping manner on a same portion of the
photosensitive material (Japanese published patent
gazette JP-B-358096 and Japanese laid-open patent
gazette Hei. 1-291236).According to the above-described prior art,
however, color development of the double-exposed
portion of the photosensitive material is difficult
because of the double-exposure of the colors through
the two times of exposures. Hence, it has been
difficult to obtain desired colors on the
photosensitive material.Other similar printers are disclosed in the post-published
EP-A-0 615 154 and in US-A-4 769 694.The present invention attends to the above-described
state of the art. A primary object of this
invention is to provide an image printer as defined in Claim 1. According to the invention, in
case a situation requires only projection-exposure of
the film image, this is done at a high-speed at the 
projection-exposure section. On the other hand, in
the case of an image composing operation based on the
film image, the reader means reads the image
information of the film image and then the image-exposure
section composes exposing image information
based on the read image information and exposes the
photosensitive material based on the composed exposing
image information.The exposing image information includes, for
example, composition of image information of the
plurality of film images read by the reader means, or
composition of the image information of the film image
read by the reader means and further image information
inputted by means of e.g. an image scanner provided
separately of the reader means and capable of reading
and inputting any image information.In the image composition described above, a
variety of

<CLAIMS>
An image printer having:

a projection-exposure section (P) for projecting and exposing a film image
onto a photosensitive material (3);
an image-exposure section (L) for exposing the photosensitive material (3)
based on exposing image information with setting an exposure amount for

each of a plurality of areas of the exposing image information; and
reader means (15) for reading the image information of the film image
with the image information being divided into the plurality of areas;
said image-exposure section (L) generating the exposing image
information on the basis of the plurality of areas of the image information

read by said reader means (15), image information stored in advance in
the image-exposure section (L) and of further image information inputted

from a first input means (I);
a transporter means (T) for transporting the photosensitive material (3)
through the projection-exposure section (P) and the image-exposure

section (L);
a control unit (C) for controlling operations of the projection-exposure
section (P), the image-exposure section (L) and the transporter means (T);

characterized by

an exposure-mode instructing means (O) for instructing the control unit
(C) to switch over between a projection-exposure mode and an

image-exposure mode;
wherein, when the exposure-mode instructing means (O) instructs the
projection-exposure mode, the control unit (C) effects a control scheme to

allow the photosensitive material (3) to be exposed only at the 
projection-exposure section (P) alone; and, when the exposure-mode

instructing means (O) instructs the image-exposure mode, the control unit
(C) effects a further control scheme to allow the photosensitive material

(3) to be exposed only at the image-exposure section (L),
said reader means (15) comprising a CCD line sensor is operable to
irradiate white light onto the film and measuring, by using the CCD line

sensor, intensity of its reflected or transmission light, with the light being
decomposed in
to three primary colors of red, green and blue,
said image-exposure section (L) in said image exposure mode is rendered
switchable between a composite mode in which a portion of the plurality of

the image information read by the reader means and corresponding to a
first image is substituted by a corresponding portion of a plurality of image

information of a second image inputted from a further input means, so as
to generate the exposing image information of a composite image

containing the remaining portion of the first image and said portion of the
second image and a non-composite mode in which said pre-stored image

information or image information inputted by said first input means (I) is
used for exposing the image information read by said reader means, and
said exposure-mode instructing means (O) is operable to instruct a
double-exposure mode in addition to the projection-exposure mode and the

image-exposure mode, such that, with an instruction for the
double-exposure mode, the control unit (C) effects a still further control

scheme in which the photosensitive material (3) is subjected to the
exposure at the projection-exposure section (P) and a further exposure-under

the non-composite mode at the image-exposure section (L) in an
overlapping manner.
