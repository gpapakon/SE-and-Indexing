<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to charge transfer devices and output circuits thereof.
The invention may for example be embodied, as described hereinbelow, as a charge
transfer device having a so-called floating diffusion or floating gate for converting
signal charges from a charge transfer unit composed of a CCD into an output voltage,
and as an output circuit thereof.Recently, an image scanner device for electrically reading out draft images
and characters as image information and a CCD delay line for delaying supplied
signals in a predetermined manner have been proposed as the device having a charge
transfer unit composed of a CCD.The image scanner reads out draft images and characters with a CCD line
sensor having linearly arrayed plural pixels 100, as shown in Fig.1. The image
scanner device drives its light source to emit light for a predetermined period during
a readout term for draft images and characters, and controls the CCD line sensor in
motion to scan the draft while driving the light source to emit light.Thus, reflected light from the draft is radiated onto the CCD line sensor. The
CCD line sensor then receives the reflected light from the draft with each of the pixels
100 and stores charges corresponding to the amount of received 
reflected light in the pixels 100. The charge stored in each of
the pixels 100 is read out at a time at predetermined time
intervals, and is transferred through a shift gate 101 to a shift
register 102. The charge transferred to the shift register 102
is transferred to an output circuit 103, which then converts the
charge into a voltage signal and supplies the resulting voltage
signal through an output terminal 104 to an image processing
circuit, not shown.The image processing circuit performs so-called process
treatment such as black level correction or white level
correction on the supplied voltage signal or image signal, and
adds a horizontal synchronizing signal or a vertical
synchronizing signal to the voltage signal. The image processing
circuit then supplies the resulting voltage signal to a monitor
device or the like. Thus, the draft images and characters are
displayed on the display screen of the monitor device.The output circuitry for converting the signal
charge transferred by the shift register 102 into the voltage
signal is composed mainly of a source follower circuit and an
analog inverter. In further detail, the output
circuitry is constituted by a charge-voltage converter 111 having
a floating diffusion (FD) for performing charge-voltage
conversion, a
