<ABSTRACT>
An upper tool holder apparatus (1) for removably 
supporting an upper tool (9) on an upper table (3) of a press 

brake includes: a holder body (5) removably attached to the 
upper table; an upper tool clamp (11) attached to the holder 

body, for pushing and fixing an upper portion of the upper 
tool to a support plate (7) provided at a lower portion of the 

holder body; a clamping force adjusting device (13) for 
adjusting a clamping force of the upper tool clamp; and a 

clamp releasing device (15) for releasing the upper tool 
clamped by the upper tool clamp. In particular, a wedge-shaped 

member (17) vertically movably provided at a lower 
portion of the upper tool clamp is formed with a stop portion 

(17K) engageable with and disengageable from an engage portion 
(9K) formed in the upper tool (9). Further, an upper tool (9) 

for a press brake includes: a contact surface (6F) contactable 
to a lower surface of a support plate (7) provided at a lower 

portion of a holder body (5) of an upper tool holder apparatus 
(1) attached to an upper table (3) of a press brake; a slide 

surface (9S) slidably contactable to a front or rear surface 
of the support plate; an engage portion (9K) engageable with 

and disengageable from a stop portion (17K) of a wedge-shaped 
member (17) vertically movably provided at an lower portion of 

an upper tool clamp (11) pivotally attached to the upper tool 
holer apparatus (1); and a work processing portion (9M) for 

processing a work in cooperation with a lower tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an upper toolholder-tool arrangement for an upper
table of a press brake according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.From EP-A-0 569 880 there is known a corresponding apparatus comprising a holder body
having a support plate provided at a lower portion thereof, an upper tool clamp attached to
said holder body, a clamping force adjusting device for adjusting a clamping force of said
upper tool clamp, a clamp releasing device for releasing the upper tool clamped by said
upper tool clamp, and a wedge-shaped member which is provided at a lower portion of said
upper tool clamp.From DE 39 32629 A1 there is known an upper tool holder apparatus for an upper table of
a press brake which includes an upper tool clamp for urging an upper tool against a support
plate wherein said upper tool clamp being provided with a spring member for resiliently
urging a tapered latch member against an upper portion of said upper tool.As is well known, a press brake is of such a structure that an upper table (referred to as an
upper apron. sometimes) and a lower table (referred to as a lower apron. sometimes) are
provided so as to be vertically opposed to each other and further any one of the upper and
lower tables is moved up and down relative to the other as a ram.Further, in the press brake, an upper tool is attached to the lower portion of the upper table
and a lower tool is attached to the upper portion of the lower table.In the above-mentioned structure, a work disposed between the upper and lower tools can
be bent when both the tools are engaged with each other by moving the movable-side table
up and down.In the above-mentioned press brake, in order to exchange an upper tool with another upper
tool according to the bending shape of work, a number of upper tool holders are attached
to the lower portion of the upper table, and further a number of tools are removably
supported by a number of the upper tool holders, respectivetly.Here, in the conventional upper tool holder, an upper 
tool clamp is mounted on a holder body attached to the lower
portion of the upper table, and the upper portion of the upper
tool is strongly fastened and fixed between the holder body
and the upper tool clamp when the upper clamp is fastened with
fastening bolts.In the conventional upper tool holder, therefore, a
great number of fastening bolts arranged on a number of upper
tool holders must be rotated in order to exchange the upper
tool on the upper table, thus causing a problem in that the
tool exchange
