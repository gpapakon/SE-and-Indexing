<ABSTRACT>
Comb for controlled (metered) distribution (dispensing) of a hair-treatment liquid, in which a bottle (1) containing the hair-treatment product receives, on its neck (2) equipped with a screw thread, a tapped end (linking) piece (5) connected via a conduit or channel (7) pierced in the back (6) of the comb (4) and ending in capillary channels (8, 15) emerging either between the teeth (10) of the comb or at the lower part of the teeth of the comb so that the liquid intended for the treatment is distributed in a sufficient metered amount, above all owing to the fact that the bottle (1) is slightly deformable in order to make it possible to convey the hair-treatment liquid under a slight pressure.
