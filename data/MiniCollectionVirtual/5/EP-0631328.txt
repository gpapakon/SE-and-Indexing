<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved,
reliable solar cell module which excels in weatherability
and continuously exhibits a desirable photoelectric
conversion efficiency without being deteriorated even upon
repeated use over a long period of time under severe
environmental conditions of high temperature and high
humidity. More particularly, the present invention relates
to an improved solar cell module comprising a solar cell
encapsulated using a filler and a sealing film which
particularly excels in moisture resistance and is hardly
deteriorated in terms of the photoelectric conversion
efficiency even upon repeated use over a long period of
time under severe environmental conditions of high
temperature and high humidity. The present invention also
include a process for producing said improved solar cell
module. In recent years, heating of the earth because of the
so-called greenhouse effect due to an increase of
atmospheric CO2 has been predicted. In view of this, there
is an increased demand for a means of power generation
capable of providing clean energy without causing CO2
buildup. In this regard, nuclear power generation has been
considered to be advantageous in view of not causing CO2
buildup. However, there are problems for nuclear power
generation in that it unavoidably produces radioactive
wastes which are harmful for living things and there is a
probability that leakage of injurious radioactive materials
from the nuclear power generation system will happen when
the system is damaged. Therefore, there is an increased
societal demand for early realization of a power generation
system capable of providing clean energy without causing
CO2 buildup as in the case of thermal power generation and
without causing radioactive wastes and radioactive
materials as in the case of nuclear power generation.There have been various proposals which are expected
to meat such societal demand. Among those proposals, solar
cells (photovoltaic elements in other words) are expected
to be a future power generation source since they supply
electric power without causing those problems as above 
mentioned.There have been proposed a variety of solar cells for
commercial and home appliances. These solar cells include
single crystal silicon series solar cells, non-single
crystal silicon series solar cells, and compound
semiconductor series solar cells. And various studies have
been made on these solar cells from various viewpoints such
as reproducibility, productivity, production cost, and the
like.Among these
