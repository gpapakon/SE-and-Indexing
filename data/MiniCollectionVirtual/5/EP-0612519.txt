<ABSTRACT>
A calcium formulation for treating milching cows 
suffering from hypcaelcemia that is prepared such 

that the keeper of the animal can administer it 
without calling in a veterinary surgeon and that the 

animal cannot be harmed by the formulation's being 
inappropriately administered. For achieving this 

purpose it is proposed that the calcium formulation 
be contained in a suppositary, or that the calcium 

formulation be contained in a paste that is introduced 
through the rectum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a use of a calcium formulation for the preparation of
medicaments for therapeutic application to milk cows post partum
and/or sub partum, suffering from hypocalcaemia.It has become apparent that approximately five to ten percent of
milk cows suffer from hypocalcaemia. In the meaning of this
present, the term "milk cows" refers to post partum and sub
partum cows. Considerable amounts of calcium are yielded with the
milk. The body cannot adapt fast enough and so, substantial
losses of calcium arise the are not, or only inadequately, replaced.
A severely reduced calcium level is so generated and the
metabolism of the muscles is also acutely affected. A cow suffering
from hypocalcaemia can, for instance, no longer stand up and,
in critical cases, hypocalcaemia may even prove lethal.A customary method for treating hypocalcaemia is the application
of calcium, or of solutions containing calcium and magnesium by
intravenous injection. An intravenous injection requires to be
made by a veterinary surgeon and the treatment hence, involves
trouble and is expensive. Efforts have therefore been made to
apply calcium and calcium/magnesium formulations orally. This,
however, has also proved to be problematic. If even a few drops
only of the formulation enter the trachea, this will cause pulmonary
necrosis. In addition, it has been found that the effectiveness
of such treatment is impaired in the case of ruminants whose
reaction to the calcium will be insufficient and utilization of
the formulation so applied is hence, inadequate. And, depending
on the shape and preparation of the calcium physic applied,
considerable necroses may be generated in the ruminant's stomach. According to an article published in 1990 in "Dairy Science"
(vol. 73, No. 2, pages 470 to 474), in cases of hypomagnesia,
magnesium formulations are injected as an aqueous solution either
intravenously, or subcutaneously or administered orally or
through the rectum. Apart from the disadvantages of injections
and the hazard of oral application that have already been referred
to, the additional disadvantage arising in this case is
the hardly noticeable and, at least partial, seeping of the
physic from the animal's mouth, or anus.The object of this invention is to prepare a medicament containing
calcium formulation for treating hypocalcaemia in cows such
that the owner of the animal will be in a position to administer
it on his own without having to call in a veterinary surgeon and
such that any hazards resulting from inappropriate
