<ABSTRACT>
A solid-state image device and a method of manufacturing are 
disclosed. The solid-state image device has: a plurality of 

pixels, each pixel having a transistor for converting an incident 
light into an electrical signal, the transistor having a 

semiconductor substrate, source-drain regions formed on a surface 
portion of the semiconductor substrate, the source-drain regions 

being spaced apart from each other to define a channel region 
between them, and a gate electrode formed above the channel 

region; a selection line electrically connected to the gate 
electrode for selecting a pixel from the plurality of pixels; an 

interlayer insulating film formed to cover the gate electrode and 
the source and drain regions; a signal line connected to one of 

the source-drain regions through a contact hole formed in the 
interlayer insulating film; and a light-shielding film formed 

below the interlayer insulating film to cover the source-drain 
region connected to the signal line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid-state image device and a 
method of manufacturing, and particularly to an amplification 
solid-state image device having transistors for photoelectric 
transfer arrayed for each of pixels, with the transistors having 
selection lines connected to their respective gate electrodes and 
having signal lines connected to their respective source-drain 
regions. A conventional amplification solid-state image device has 
plural MOS transistors Tr for photoelectric transfer 
corresponding to pixels arrayed in a matrix, as shown in Fig.1. 
These transistors Tr have their respective gate electrode 
connected to a horizontal selection lines Lh extending in rows 
from a horizontal shift register HR. The transistors Tr also 
have their respective source regions connected to a vertical 
signal line Ls extending in the direction of column and their 
respective drain regions connected to power sources having a 
power source voltage Vdd. In each of the transistors Tr, incidence of light generates 
an electron-hole pair in response to the amount of incident 
light. Of the electron-hole pair thus formed, the electron flows  
 
into a channel region while the hole advances into a depleted 
substrate surface. Thus, the threshold value of the transistor 
changes. Consequently, when one horizontal selection line Lh of the 
horizontal selection lines Lh extending in rows from the 
horizontal shift register HR connected to peripheral circuits has 
a high potential level, signal currents corresponding to the 
threshold value appear on the corresponding parts of the vertical 
signal line Ls, so as to be outputted as image signals of 
selected rows, as disclosed in the US Patent No. 4,901,129, "Bulk 
Charge Modulated Transistor Threshold Image Sensor Elements and 
Method of Making", which corresponds to the preamble of claim 1. In the conventional amplification solid-state image device, 
however, one of the transistors Tr forming pixels has a cross 
section in which the vertical signal line Ls composed of an Al 
interconnecting layer is only connected to a source region 101 
formed in an N-type impurity diffused region through a contact 
hole 104 formed in a transparent interlayer insulating film 103 
on a gate electrode 102, as shown in Fig.2. The Al interconnecting layer Ls, which serves to shield 
lights, may have a width smaller than that of the formation area 
for the underlying source region 101. In this case, it is often 
the case that a light of normal incidence permeates the 
transparent
