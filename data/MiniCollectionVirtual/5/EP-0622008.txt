<ABSTRACT>
The mechanical rake comprises a hollow handle (2, 2', 2'') secured to one of the ends of a casing (5, 5', 5'') containing a drive mechanism (6, 6', 6'') actuated by an electric motor or heat engine (3) for the reciprocating and transverse displacement of a cutting blade (7, 7', 7'') whose plane of cutting is parallel to the ground (S) and points in the raking direction (F), a second cutting blade which is fixed or mobile (8, 8', 8'') interacting with the first in order to form several parallel scissors, and runners (11) being provided in order to determine the cutting height relative to the ground (S) while gathering means (12, 16) are fixed behind the said cutting blades to hold the cut waste temporarily.

Mechanical rake for clearing, mowing, levelling,
raking all kinds of grass and various plant matter,

comprising a hollow handle (2, 2', 2'') secured at one
of its ends to a casing (5, 5', 5'') containing a drive

mechanism (6, 6', 6'') driven by an electric motor or
engine (3) for moving a first cutting blade (7, 7', 7'')

back and forth transversely with respect to a second
blade (8, 8', 8'') which interacts with the first to

form a number of parallel shears, characterized in that
the second blade is a cutting blade and in that the

handle (2, 2', 2'') of the rake (1, 1', 1'') is inclined
by an angle α of approximately 45° with respect to the

said blades so that the cutting blades (7, 7', 7'' and
8, 8', 8'') are in a cutting plane parallel to that of

the ground (S), the said handle pointing in the
direction of raking (F), while shoes (11, 11', 11'')are

provided under the said second blade (8, 8', 8''), these
shoes being fixed or adjustable to suit the desired

cutting height relative to the ground (S) and that
collecting means (12, 16) are fixed behind the said

cutting blades for temporarily holding the waste
cuttings.
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
second blade (8) has, in the extension of each tooth

(8
a
), fingers (8
b
) to protect the individual.
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
blades (7, 7', 8') each have a lug (7
b
, 7'
b
, 8'
c
), the
lugs being bent at an obtuse angle so that the cutting

plane of the said blades is parallel to the ground (S).
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
electric motor or engine (3) is fixed to the opposite

end of the hollow handle (2, 2', 2'') from the casing
(5, 5', 5''). 
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
drive mechanism (6) consists of an operating shaft (6
a
)
which may be solid or hollow, rigid or flexible,

telescopic or non-telescopic, to the end of which is
attached a sleeve (6
b
) guided axially inside the casing
(5), the sa
id sleeve being secured to a balanced cam
(6
d
) cooperating with the cutting blade (7) to make it
move transversely back and forth.
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
drive mechanism (6') consists of an operating shaft

(6'
a
) which may be solid or hollow, rigid or flexible,
telescopic or non-telescopic, to the end of which is

attached a sleeve (6'
b
) guided axially inside the
casing (5'), the said sleeve being secured to two

balanced cams (6'
d
, 6'
e
) cooperating respectively with
the cutting blades (7', 8') to make them move

transversely back and forth.
Rake according to Claim 6, characterized in that the
drive mechanism (6') comprises two disc-shaped cams

(6'
d
, 6'
e
) which are offset by 180 degrees from one
another for making the blades (7', 8') move

transversely back and forth.
Rake according to Claim 7, characterized in that the
cam (6'
d
) cooperates with an oblong opening (7'
a
) in
the blade (7'), while the cam (6'
e
) is introduced into
an oblong opening (8'
b
) in the blade (8').
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
position of the blades (7'', 8'') relative to the ground

(S) is achieved using an angular transmission device
(14) that allows the handle (2'') to be inclined

relative to the casing (5''); the said angular
transmission device interacting with the drive

mechanism (6'') allows the blade (7'') to move
transversely back and forth. 
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the collecting means (12, 16) consist respectively of a

deflector and of a metal broom each secured to the
casing (5) and to the hollow handle (2'').
Rake according to Claim 1, characterized in that a
rake (13, 15) is fixed in front of the cutting blades

(7, 7', 7''; 8, 8', 8'') in the direction of raking (F).
