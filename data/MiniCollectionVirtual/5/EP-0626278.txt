<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed toward anionic polymerization initiators 
which are soluble in acyclic alkane solvents. The initiators include a solubilized lithio 

amine having the general formula (A)Li(SOL)
y
. SOL is a solubilizing component and 
A is an alkyl, dialkyl or cycloalkyl amine radical or a cyclic amine and y is from about 

1 to 4. The cyclic amine has an alkylene, oxy- or amino-alkylene group having from 
about 3 to about 16 methylene groups. The invention is also directed toward polymers 

and other products made using the initiator, and methods therefor. Further, the 
invention contemplates a polymer, a polymer composition and products therefrom, 

which include a functional group from the reaction product of an amine and an 
organolithium compound. The resulting polymers may be terminated with a terminating, 

coupling or linking agent, which may provide the polymer wtih a multifunctionality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to anionic polymerizations resulting in diene
polymer and copolymer elastomers. More particularly, the present invention relates to
polymerization employing a solubilized amine initiator. Specifically, the invention
relates to a solubilized lithium amine initiator which is soluble in acyclic alkane solvents,
and which will reproducibly polymerize monomers in a controllable and narrow
molecular weight distribution range.When conducting polymerizations on a commercial basis, it is important to
utilize process conditions and components which will allow the molecular weight of the
end products to be narrowly and reproducibly defined. The characteristics of a given
polymer and its usefulness are dependent, among other things, upon its molecular
weight. Hence, it is desirable to be able to predict with some certainty the molecular
weight of the end product of the polymerization. When the molecular weight is not
narrowly definable, or is not reproducible on a systematic basis, the process is not
commercially viable.In the art, it is desirable to produce elastomeric compounds exhibiting
reduced hysteresis characteristics. Such elastomers, when compounded to form articles
such as tires, and power belts, will show an increase in rebound, a decrease in
rolling resistance and will have less heat build-up when mechanical stresses are applied.A major source of hysteretic power loss has been established to be due to the
section of the polymer chain from the last cross link of the vulcanizate to the end of the
polymer chain. This free end cannot be involved in an efficient elastically recoverable
process, and as a result, any energy transmitted to this section of the cured sample is
lost as heat. It is known in the art that this type of mechanism can be reduced by 
preparing higher molecular weight polymers which will have fewer end groups.
However, this procedure is not useful because processability of the rubber with
compounding ingredients and during shaping operations decreases rapidly with
increasing molecular weight.It is difficult to obtain consistent properties, such as a reduction in hysteresis
properties, if the polymer cannot be controllably reproduced in a narrow molecular
weight range distribution. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,471, in which some
polymers are prepared with a heterogeneous mixture of certain secondary amines,
including lithium pyrrolidide. Polymers made in this manner have widely variable
molecular weights, broad polydispersities, and their functional
