<ABSTRACT>
A clock circuit includes an oscillator (15) for 
generating a reference frequency signal, and a spread 

spectrum clock generator (14) cooperating with the 
oscillator for generating a spread spectrum clock 

output signal having a fundamental frequency and 
reduced amplitude EMI spectral components at harmonics 

of the fundamental frequency. The spread spectrum 
clock generator preferably includes a clock pulse 

generator for generating a series of clock pulses, and 
a spread spectrum modulator for frequency modulating 

the clock pulse generator to broaden and flatten 
amplitudes of EMI spectral com
ponents which would 
otherwise be produced by the clock pulse generator. 

The spread spectrum modulator frequency modulates the 
clock pulses with specific profiles of frequency 

deviation versus the period of the profile. Electronic 
devices including the spread spectrum clock circuit and 

associated method are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of
digital circuits, and more particularly, to a clock
circuit having reduced measurable electromagnetic
interference (EMI) emissions.Many electronic devices employ
microprocessors or other digital circuits which require
one or more clock signals for synchronization. A clock
signal permits the precise timing of events in the
microprocessor, for example. Typical microprocessors
may be supervised or synchronized by a free-running
oscillator, such as driven by a crystal, an LC-tuned
circuit, or an external clock source. Clocking rates
up to and beyond 40 MHz are common in personal
computers. The parameters of a clock signal are
typically specified for a microprocessor and may
include minimum and maximum allowable clock
frequencies, tolerances on the high and low voltage
levels, maximum rise and fall times on the waveform
edges, pulse-width tolerance if the waveform is not a
square wave, and the timing relationship between clock
phases of two-clock phase signals are needed. (See
Electronics Engineers' Handbook, by Fink et al., p. 8-111,
1989.) Unfortunately, high performance,
microprocessor-based devices using leading edge, high
speed circuits are particularly susceptible to
generating and radiating electromagnetic interference
(EMI). The spectral components of the EMI emissions
typically have peak amplitudes at harmonics of the
fundamental frequency of the clock circuit.
Accordingly, many regulatory agencies, such as the FCC
in the United States, have established testing
procedures and maximum allowable emissions for such
products. For example, the Commission Electrotechnique
Internationale (Comite International Special Des
Perturbations Radioelectriques (C.I.S.P.R.)) has
guidelines establishing measurement equipment and
techniques for determining compliance with regulations.
More particularly, for the frequency band of interest
to clock circuits, the measured 6 dB bandwidth is a
relatively wide 120 KHz.In order to comply with such government
limits on EMI emissions, costly suppression measures or
extensive shielding may be required. Other approaches
for reducing EMI include careful routing of signal
traces on printed circuit boards to minimize loops and
other potentially radiating structures. Unfortunately,
such an approach often leads to more expensive
multilayer circuit boards with internal ground planes.
In addition, greater engineering effort must go into
reducing EMI emissions. The difficulties caused by EMI
emissions are made worse at higher processor and clock
spe
