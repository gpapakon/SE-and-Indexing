<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a plant nutrient
composition for providing plants with one or more metal
ions in a form in which said metal ions can be absorbed by
plants. The invention also concerns a method for
administration of metal ions to plants deficient of such
metal ions or for the prevention of such ion deficiency.The present invention is in the field of fertilizers and concerns the
production of compositions which bear metal elements for the purpose of
administering these metal elements to vegetation for absorption by the
vegetation.Various metal ions are essential elements for the nutrition of
plants. Deficiency of these metal ions in vegetation is often the cause of
poor growth and yield of plants. Iron, manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium
and calcium are all important in plant growth. Iron is particularly important.One limiting factor in the absorption of iron, manganese, zinc and
copper by plant roots is that their ions tend to form highly insoluble oxides
and this limits their availability. For example, in soil iron ions are present
either in their divalent (Fe+2) or trivalent (Fe+3) form with neutral or alkaline
conditions favoring the latter. In the trivalent form, iron ions form highly
stable precipitates having a solubility coefficient in the order of 1038. In
consequence, soils in which there is a neutral or basic pH, such as 
calcareous soil in which the calcium carbonate acts as a buffer maintaining
a high pH, iron precipitates rapidly and thus becomes unavailable to plant
roots. Administration of iron in a divalent ionic salt has not proved to be
sufficiently efficient. Administration of iron in the form of salts by means
of spraying is common in agricultural practice. Preparations containing
L-77 (Union Carbide), an expensive silicon based wetting agent, together
with ferrous sulfate, have become a preparation of choice for various crops
in which soil applied iron nutrients are neither sufficiently efficacious or cost
effective. Swietlik D. and Faust M. 1984 (Horticultural Reviews, 6:287-356)
recommend the use of such preparations for deciduous orchards.
Examples are wax flower, persimmon, mango and citrus. Wax flower plants
are members of the genus Chamaelaucium which belong to the Myrtaceae
family.Deficiency in iron causes plant leaves to loose chlorophyll. As the
deficiency increases the leaves turn yellow or almost white. This symptom
is called chlorosis.Some plants such as wax flower need iron to be more freely
available for absorption than other crops. Accordingly, for
