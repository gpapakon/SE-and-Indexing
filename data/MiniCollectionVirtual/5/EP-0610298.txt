<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods for prolonging the function of a transplanted allograft and preventing transplant rejection are provided. Particularly, tolerance is induced in a recipient mammal to a transplanted organ or tissue by treatment with a composition comprising more than one adhesion molecule inhibitor including antibodies to the adhesion molecule and corresponding ligand, e.g. antibodies to LFA-1 and ICAM-1. Compositions of the invention find additional use in treating inflammatory reactions, as well as allergies and autoimmune diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
Preventlng allograft rejection with antibodies to adhesion molecules.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of transplantation, particularly to methods for preventing allograft rejection.Background of the InventionTransplantation of organs and tissues is an important aspect of treating end-stage organ failure and replacing damaged tissue. The use of allogeneic, or non-self, transplantation tissue has become increasingly important in medicine. The use of allografts, however, is limited by the frequent rejection of the graft tissue by the recipient host, because of antigenic differences between the donor and the recipient.The antigenic differences between individual members of the same species are referred to as "alloantigens." When alloantigens are involved in rejection of allogeneic tissue grafts, they are referred to as "histocompatibility antigens." The terms "major histocompatibility antigens" and "major histocompatibility complex" (MHC) refer to the products of a single closely-linked region of genes.Graft rejection is the consequence of the host immune response to histocompatibility antigens expressed by the graft tissue. Allografts generally survive for a period of days to weeks, but may subsequently become inflamed and infiltrated with lymphocytes and monocytes. The graft tissue eventually becomes necrotic, and in the case of skin transplants, is sloughed from the skin. However, in the case of a vital organ such as the heart, the sequelae to tissue rejection can be fatal to the recipient. Cyclosporine is a cyclic, nonwater-soluble, highly nonpolar molecule composed of 11 amino acids. Cyclosporine is widely used for prolonging the function of various 

 transplanted organs. Its immunosuppressive effects selectively inhibit T-cell function, allowing survival of allografts without myelosuppression, i.e., heart transplants (see Meyers et al. , N. EnÏƒl. J. Med. 311:699 (1984)). One of the major disadvantages in conventional immunosuppressants including cyclosporine and steroid is the generalized suppression of host immunity, which causes seriou opportunistic infection in patients. To overcome the serious side effects of conventional drugs, antigen- specific immunosuppression is strongly desired.Also, the use of cyclosporine is somewhat limited, both by its association with infection and also because of hepatic and renal toxicities. Clinical use of cyclosporine is associated with reversible, dose-related increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels and depressio
