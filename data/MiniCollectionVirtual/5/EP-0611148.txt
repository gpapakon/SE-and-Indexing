<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel trisarylaminobenzene
derivatives, compounds for organic electroluminescent elements,
and organic electroluminescent elements.Organic electroluminescent (EL) elements include a thin
film containing a luminescent organic compound interposed
between a cathode and an anode. Electrons and holes are
injected into the thin film where they are recombined to create
excitons. Light is emitted by utilizing luminescence
(phosphorescence or fluorescence) upon deactivation of
excitons. The organic EL elements are characterized by plane
light emission at a high luminance of about 1000 cd/m2 with a
low voltage of less than 10 volts and light emission in a
spectrum from blue to red color by a simple choice of the type
of fluorescent material.The organic EL elements, however, are undesirably short in
effective life, less durable and less reliable because of the
following factors.
(1) Physical changes of organic compounds: To prevent
dielectric breakdown of elements due to defects along grain
boundaries and surface non-uniformity, an organic compound 
capable of forming a smooth amorphous thin film must be used.
However, the film is less stable in quality and thus allows
crystallization to take place with the lapse of time and such
crystallization is promoted by a temperature rise of the
element due to heat build-up during operation, resulting in a
change of film quality. There is a need for a material which
can be made vitreous by simple means such as vacuum evaporation
and maintains the vitreous state in a stable manner.(2) Oxidation and stripping of the cathode: Metals having
a low work function such as Mg, Li and Na are used as the
cathode in order to increase its electron injection efficiency
while these metals are reactive with oxygen and moisture in
air. As a result, the cathode can be stripped from the organic
layer.(3) Low emission efficacy and increased heat build-up: As
the element temperature rises, crystallization is promoted and
the organic layer can be melted and broken. It is desired to
increase the conversion efficiency of input energy and to find
a material capable of imparting heat resistance to the organic
layer.(4) Opto-chemical and electro-chemical changes of organic
compounds. Shirota who is one of the present inventors has made a
number of proposals and reports about π-electron system
amorphous molecular materials as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 308688/1992, Polymer Preprints,
