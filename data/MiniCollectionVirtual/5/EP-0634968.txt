<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for producing bars (30) from a curable material such as a plastic or a casting resin, the bars being intended in particular for use in the production of buttons. The device is designed essentially in the shape of a pipe (16) intended to hold the material, which may be liquid or viscous. Running longitudinally through the pipe (16) is a conveyor belt (14) which, in the interior of the pipe (16), assumes the shape of a hose (18) with overlapping longitudinal edges (20). At the entrance (22) to the pipe (16), a feed pipe (26) for the liquid or viscous material discharges into the hose (18).
