<ABSTRACT>
A method and resulting ohmic contact structure between a high work function metal such as platinum, and a wide bandgap semiconductor such as silicon carbide, for which the work function of the metal would ordinarily be insufficient to form an ohmic contact between the metal and the semiconductor. The structure can withstand annealing while retaining ohmic characteristics. The ohmic contact structure comprises a portion of single crystal wide bandgap semiconductor material; a contact formed of a high work function metal on the semiconductor portion; and a layer of doped p-type semiconductor material between the single crystal portion and the metal contact. The doped layer has a sufficient concentration of p-type dopant to provide ohmic behavior between the metal and the semiconductor material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a method of
successfully forming ohmic contacts to p-type wide
bandgap semiconductor materials using high work
function metals, as well as the resulting ohmic contact
structures. In a particular embodiment, the invention
is a method for forming platinum ohmic contacts on
silicon carbide and the resulting ohmic contact
structures.In typical applications, semiconductor
devices are operated by, and are used to control, the
flow of electric current within specific circuits to
accomplish particular tasks. Accordingly, because of
their high conductivity, the most useful and convenient
materials for carrying current from device to device
are metals.In order to connect devices into useful
circuits, appropriate contacts must be made between
semiconductor devices and the metals--e.g. printed
circuits, wires, or any other appropriate metal
elements--used to carry current. Often, the most
appropriate contacts are also formed of metal. Such
metal contacts should interfere either minimally or
preferably not at all with the operation of either the 
device or the current carrying metal. The contact must
also be physically and chemically compatible with the
semiconductor material.In this regard, the term "ohmic contact" is
used to define such an appropriate metal-semiconductor
contact. Specifically, an ohmic contact can be defined
as a metal-semiconductor contact that has a negligible
contact resistance relative to the bulk or spreading
resistance of the semiconductor, Sze, Physics of
Semiconductor Devices, Second Edition, 1981, page 304.
As further stated therein, an appropriate ohmic contact
will not significantly change the performance of the
device to which it is attached, and it can supply any
required current with a voltage drop that is
appropriately small compared with the drop across the
active region of the device.An ohmic contact can also be qualified using
other characteristics of both a metal and a
semiconductor. In most cases, and in addition to the
other necessary physical and chemical characteristics,
in order to act as an ohmic contact to a particular p-type
semiconductor, the metal must have a work function
greater than the work function of the semiconductor.
Ideally, the work function of the metal should be
greater than the electron affinity and the bandgap of
the semiconductor.As known to those familiar with this art and
this terminology, the work function is defined in terms
of the Fermi energy of the material. In turn, the
Fermi energy of a material is the effective average
