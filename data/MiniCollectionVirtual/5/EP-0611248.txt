<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for
treatment of impotency in men and method of administering same.Functional impotence is commonly associated with hypertension and
is one of the most common side effects of many antihypertensive medications.
It is a major cause of non-compliance with anithypertensive treatment.
Medication to enhance sexual potency in men is known, but physicians are
often reluctant to prescribe such medication because its main side effect is to
raise blood pressure.Acta Urol Belg, vol. 56, no. 2, p.272-278, 1988 refers to the
successful combined treatment of 20 patients with erectile failure with oral
yohimbine (0,3 mg per kg daily) and weekly intracavernous injections of low
dosed vasodilator drugs (papaverine and phentalamine). Although effective,
self-injection under these circumstances is not readily acceptable by most
patients.WO-A-92 11851 discloses a method for treatment of sexual
impotence by combining oral alpha-1 blocking agents (i.e. doxazosin or
terazosin) with beta adrenergic blocking agents. It is stated that the method is
suited for patients suffering from hypertension. Whereas the selective
administration of either alpha or beta blocking drugs may impair the sexual
function it was found, that the combination therapy with oral application was
beneficial upon the sexual process. According to the experience of the inventor
the combination of alpha and beta blockade does not solve the problem of
sexual dysfunction.EP-A-0 459 666 refers to the treatment of erectile impotence in a
human male by administering diverse vasoactive substances, including
doxazosin. Results of trials showed the satisfactory effect of an intracavernosal
injection. In addition to die awkwardness and embarrassment, this procedure
can lead to unpredictable results (including priapism), as well as long-term
complications (scarring)EP-A-0 408 440 describes an injectable vasoactive substances in
the treatment of impotence. A typical composition contains inter alia 
phentolamine as alpha blocker, atropine as anticholinergic, yohimbine as alpha
2-blocker, dipyridamole as phosphodiesterase inhibitor and piribedil as
dopaminergic agent and papaverine. According to this document phentolamine,
a short-acting alpha-adrenergic blocker, is also used as a local vasodilator
given along with other local vasodilators by intracavernosal injection on
demand. Although this method is effective, it has the drawback that a self-injection
is required which is not acceptable by most patients.There
