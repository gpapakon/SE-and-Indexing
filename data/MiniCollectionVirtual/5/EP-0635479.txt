<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to UCN-1028D derivatives 
having protein kinase C inhibitory activity and anti-tumor 
activity and which are useful as anti-tumor agents. As a substance having a perylenequinone skeleton 
and which is structurally related to the compounds of the 
present invention, there is known Phleichrome isolated as a 
plant poison from Cladosporiumphlei which causes spots on 
pasture [Agricultural & Biological Chemistry, 39, 1683 
(1975), J. Jap. Pasture, 28 (4), 426 (1983)]. Similar substances 
UCN-1028A and UCN-1028C having anti-tumor and 
protein kinase C inhibitory activity are disclosed in 
European Patent Publication No. 0284358. The structural formulae of UCN-1028A and UCN-1028C 
are shown below. 
The present invention provides UCN-1028D derivatives 
[hereinafter referred to as Compounds (I)] represented 
by general formula (I): 
 
wherein Y represents 
 
with the proviso that 
when Y is 
 
the perylenequinone ring takes R 
configuration with respect to the bond between 6a and 6b, 
and when Y is 
 
the perylenequinone ring takes S 
configuration with respect to the bond between 6a and 6b.  
 In the perylenequinone derivatives having bulky 
substituents at the 1- and 12-positions and at the 6- and 
7-positions, the perylenequinone skeleton does not take a 
plane structure because of these 
substituents, but twists on its axis of the bonds between 
the 6a- and 6b-positions and the 12a- and 12b-positions. 
Thus, isomers are present with the perylenequinone ring. That is, UCN-1028D having the following structural 
formula: 
  
 
in which the perylenequinone ring takes S configuration on 
the bond between the 6a- and 6b-positions is isomerized by 
heating in a toluene or xylene solution to form an isomer 
of UCN-1028D (hereinafter referred to as UCN-1028 iso-D) 
represented by the following structural formula: 
 
in which the perylenequinone ring takes R configuration on 
the bond between the 6a- and 6b-positions. These compounds 
reach the equilibrium in 1 : 1. UCN-1028D and UCN-1028 iso-D can be separated 
from each other by thin layer chromatography or column 
chromatography using silica gel. UCN-1028 iso-D can be 
thermally isomerized into UCN-1028D under the same conditions 
as in the isomerization of UCN-1028D. The present invention includes UCN-1028D 
derivative and UCN-1028 iso-D derivative 
and a mixture thereof. Compounds (I) can be 
produced by the following steps. UCN-1028D can be obtained by alkaline hydrolysis 
of UCN-1028A or UCN-1028C. The hydrolysis of UCN-1028A or
