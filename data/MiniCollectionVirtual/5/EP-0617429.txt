from each other and to a high impedance when the first and second 
nodes have logic levels equal to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device and, more particularly, to an improvement in a data output
circuit of a random access memory device incorporated with a test
circuit.As well known in the art, a semiconductor memory device is
required to have a memory cell correctly storing logic "1" or "0"
indicative of data and a data read/write circuit correctly
operating to read and write data from and into a selected memory
cell. It is therefore required to test the memory device to
ensure the corrective operation of each memory cell and the date
read/write circuit. In order to facilitate the test operation,
a test circuit is incorporated into the memory device in general.Referring to Fig.1, a prior art memory devise 100 includes
first and second memory cell arrays 6-1 and 6-2. Each of the
cell arrays 6-1 and 6-2 has such a circuit construction as shown
in Fig. 2. Particularly, the memory cell array 6 includes two
pairs of data input/output lines Ioi, Ioi and Ioj, Ioj, a
plurality of column switches YSW, a plurality of sense amplifiers
SA and a memory cell Portion MC. The memory cell portion MC
included a plurality of word lines WL, a plurality pairs of bit
lines DL and DL and a plurality of memory cells each disposed at
a different one of intersections of the word and bit lines.
Since this memory circuit is well known in the art, the further
description will be omitted.Referring back to Fig. 1, the data input/output line pairs 
(Io0, Io0) to (Io3, Io3) from the memory cell arrays 6 are
connected to data amplifiers DRO to DR3, respectively. The data
amplifiers DR0-DR3 are in turn connected to data bus lines RWB0-RW3,
respectively. Connected between the data bus lines RWB and
an output terminal DOUT is an output circuit 9. Although not
shown, the memory device 100 further includes an address
buffer/decoder circuit as well as a data write circuit, as well
known in the art.The memory device 100 thus constructed performs data read
and write operations on one memory cell in a selected one of the
arrays 6 in a normal operation. As mentioned hereinbefore, it
is required to test a circuit operation. For this purpose, a
test data is written into a selected memory cell and then the
data stored in that memory cell is read out therefrom. At this
time, if the test data write operation would be carried out one
cell by one, it would take a relatively long time period.
Therefore, the memory device 100 is constructed such that a
plurality of memory cells are selected and written with the same
data
