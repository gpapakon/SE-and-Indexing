<ABSTRACT>
A device comprising, in a (per se) known manner, a valve (7) co-operating with two valve seats (10b, 16a) for controlling servo operation. The second seat (16a) is provided on a sliding sleeve (16) to accelerate air intake and cut the servo response time.

Valve type control device for a pneumatic brake-booster, 
comprising: 


a control rod (8) which can be displaced, from a 
position of rest, in a first axial direction (8a) through 

the action of an input force, said rod being capped by a 
sensor (10) which in turn ends axially in a support face 

(10a); 
an annular valve (7) surrounding the control rod, 
said valve being urged elastically towards the first 

axial direction and being able to be actuated by the 
displacement of the control rod; 
a first valve seat (10b) formed by an annular 
portion of the sensor at the opposite end to the support 

face of the latter; 
a pneumatic piston (5) movable in the first axial 
direction, from a position of rest, through the action of 

a pressure difference caused by actuation of the valve, 
said piston having an annular axial surface (5a) 

surrounding the sensor; 
a reaction disk (11) housed in a cup (13) and having 
a free face against which the annular axial surface of 

the pneumatic piston and the support face of the sensor 
can apply combined forces for action on a push rod (12); 

and 
a second valve seat (16a) of annular shape, 
concentric to and outside the first seat and, in the 

position of rest of the control rod, occupying a position 
further ahead than that of the first valve seat in the 

sense of the first axial direction, the valve being 
applied against the first seat in the position of rest 

and against the second seat on being actuated, 
 
characterized in that the second seat is formed by an end 

face of a sleeve (16) sealingly slidably mounted relative 
to the piston (5) and configured to undergo, relative to 

the cup (13), no movement in the sense of the first axial 
direction when the valve is actuated.  

 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sleeve (16) forming the second valve seat bears 

against the cup, at least by means of an axial extension 
(16b) 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sleeve (16) forming the second valve seat is 

disposed between the sensor and the piston and has a 
second end face (16c) against which, on actuation of the 

valve, the free face of the reaction disk (11) comes to 
bear before coming into contact with the sensor, said 

sleeve then undergoing, relative to the cup, a movement 
in a second axial direction (8b) opposite to the first. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a spring (17) urges the sleeve towards the first 

axial direction.
