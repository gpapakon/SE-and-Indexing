<ABSTRACT>
Manufacture of sugarfree maltitol sweets by heating a 
concentrated aqueous solution of maltitol including at 

least 50% by weight of solid maltitol, the balance being 
other sugar alcohols, at atmospheric pressure to a tempe- 

rature in the range 190-250 °C, and preferably 200-210 °C, 
and then working the resulting mass into sweets in the 

usual manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process for making sugarfree 
sweets or pastilles which consist of at least 50% by 
weight of maltitol, the balance being other sugar alcohols, 
flavourings, optionally colour and optionally a 
little water. In the sugar confectionary industry the term "boiled 
sugar" is used for the well-known hard sugar sweets which 
have a glass-like appearance and a crisp consistency. Such 
boiled sugar sweets traditionally consist of a mixture of 
saccharose and glucose syrup, which has been dehydrated by 
boiling. The traditional manufacture of sugar sweets in 
the sweet boiling industry consists in boiling at 173-180 
°C and atmospheric pressure, following which the heated 
dewatered sugar mass is allowed to cool until it assumes a 
plastic consistency, and it is then kneaded together with 
optional colour and flavourings on a suitable substrate 
(best an iron table coated by a hide). If desired, air is 
then introduced into the mass by repeated pulling from a 
hook to provide a silky gloss, and finally sausages of the 
mass are cut into sweets which are cooled to room temperature 
by means of blowers. The sweets obtain a very fine, 
hard and crisp consistency, but they yellow and become 
dark and slightly bitter if the heating is not sufficiently 
rapid, i.e. the heating period is too long. Modern 
industrial manufacture of sugar sweets takes place by de-watering 
of the sugar syrup in vacuum at a lower temperature, 
following which flavourings and optionally colour 
are added and, if desired, air is introduced into the 
mass, which in a so-called lump roll is then heated again 
and pulled out into a string which is moulded into sweets 
by machine rolling or cutting. However, this does not impart 
the same fine consistency and taste to the sweets as  
 
boiling. For the manufacture of sugarfree sweets of boiled sugar 
type it is usual to replace the mixture of saccharose and 
glucose syrup with sorbitol syrups, optionally containing 
mannitol, or by hydrogenated starch hydrolysates. However, 
these mixtures have certain drawbacks; the sorbitol syrups 
because they are too liquid and therefore have to be hot-poured 
into sweet moulds, and also crystallisation phenomena 
may occur owing to the high content of sorbitol; the 
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates because they are less 
sweet and moreover have a not insignificant cariogenic 
nature. Furthermore, sorbitol is converted into glucose 
during digestion and is therefore not suitable for diabetics. Since the sweetening effect and nature
