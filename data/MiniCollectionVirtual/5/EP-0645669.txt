<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
regulating silver halide emulsion formation. It
particularly relates to the determination of the tabular
silver halide grain population during nucleation and
ripening.The formation of tabular silver halide
photographic emulsions generally comprises of three main
steps. These steps are, as described in U.S. Patent
4,797,354 (Saitou, Urabe and Ozeki, 1989) (a) the
nucleation step whereby the conditions are selected to
generate mostly doubly twinned nuclei with parallel twin
planes, which are suitable for producing tabular grains;
(b) the ripening step whereby the conditions are changed
to promote the dissolution of any nuclei that are not
suitable for forming tabular grains (e.g., multiply
twinned nuclei with nonparallel twin planes, singly
twinned nuclei, octahedral and cuboctahedral nuclei), so
that a high population of tabular crystals is achieved;
and (c) the growth step whereby the surviving tabular
grain nuclei are grown in size without changing their
total number, by adding silver and halide reactants at
rates which do not exceed the maximum growth rate as
described by Wey and Strong in "Growth Mechanism of AgBr
Crystals in Gelatin Solution", Photographic Science and
Engineering, Vol. 21, 1977, pp. 14-18.The nucleation and ripening steps are very
important because they determine the final stable number
of tabular crystals, and hence the average grain volume
per mass of silver reactant added, as well as the tabular
grain population of the final emulsion. Of these two
steps, the nucleation step is the most critical because 
the effect of the ripening step is limited to reducing
nontabular grain nuclei.The final tabular grain population of AgBr
emulsions containing small amounts of iodide and/or
chloride is consequently, largely dependent on the
nucleation step, which can be carried out by the single-jet
method, where silver reactant is added to a well-mixed
solution of gelatin, or other appropriate peptizer,
and halide, or by the double-jet method, where silver and
halide reactants are simultaneously added to a well-mixed
solution of gelatin, or other appropriate peptizer, at a
controlled pBr, as described by Duffin in "Photographic
Emulsion Chemistry", Ch. IV, 1966, by Berry in "The
Theory of the Photographic Process", Ch. 3, T. H. James
(Ed.), 4th Ed. 1977, and by Wey in "Preparation and
Properties of Solid State Materials", Vol. 6, Ch. 2,
W. R. Wilcox (Ed.), 1981. The nucleation step can also
be carried out by a dual-zone process, using a two-reactor
system,

A method of measuring to control silver
halide grain formation during nucleation and ripening

comprising

combining a source of silver ions and a source of
halide ions to form a suspension of nucleated particles,
removing a portion of said suspension,
measuring turbidity of said portion,
determining floc size from the turbidity

determining the difference between floc size and
individual silver halide nuclei size.
The method of Claim 1 wherein a portion of
said suspension is treated to eliminate floculation and

allow determination of nuclei size.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the
difference between floc size and nuclei size allows

prediction of the percentage of tabular grain population.
The method of Claim 2 wherein a defloculant
is added to separate said flocs into individual nuclei

for measurement of nuclei size.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said
determination of said floc size is made by the Rayleigh

scattering equation from the measured suspension density.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said

difference between floc size and nuclei size is greater
than 20 nm to give a high population of tabular grains.
The method of Claim 6 wherein said
difference is greater than 100 nm. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said
combining and measuring is carried out as part of a

continuous manufacturing process.

difference between floc size and nuclei size is greater

than 20 nm and the nucleated particles are grown to form
tabular grains.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said
difference between floc size and nuclei size is less than

20 nm and the nucleated particles are discarded.
