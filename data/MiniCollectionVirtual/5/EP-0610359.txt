<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for enriching fetal progenitor cells from maternal blood, comprising the steps of (a) incubating a sample of maternal blood with an immobilized ligand capable of binding to fetal progenitor cells under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow specific binding of the ligand to the cells, and (b) removing unbound blood products such that the fetal progenitor cells are enriched.

 DescriptionA METHOD FOR ENRICHING FETAL PROGENITOR CELLS FROM MATERNAL BLOODCross Reference to Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Application Serial No. 07/513,057, filed April 23, 1990.Technical FieldThe invention relates to a method of enriching fetal progenitor cells from maternal blood.Background of the InventionApproximately 5.3 million women become pregnant in the United States yearly, resulting in 3.8 million deliveries. There are an additional 10 million deliveries in the other affluent countries in the world. Prenatal testing is used in a subgroup of these women who have a significant risk of having a fetus with a genetic disorder such as Down's Syndrome.At present, the only way of diagnosing fetal disorders is to obtain cells from the amniotic fluid (amniocentesis) or the surface of the fetal sac (chorionicvillus) of the mother. These procedures are expensive and carry a risk of spontaneous abortion of between V2 0 to 1%. Because of the risk of spontaneous abortion, these collection procedures are recommended only for women who are at a high-risk of carrying a child with a genetic defect. For example, only women over age 35 are advised to have the test because the risk of Down's Syndrome is higher in that group. Some of these women refuse the test because of the risk of spontaneous abortion. Even though many of these high-risk women are tested, only a fraction of fetuses with Down's Syndrome are detected. The high-risk women represent such a small portion of the women having children that the low-risk population still delivers most of the afflicted children. Eighty percent of those children born with Down's Syndrome are from the "low-risk," under 35-year-old group. This situation is also true of many other genetic defects or disorders. 

 It is therefore desirable to provide a test that would resolve this testing dilemma by providing a safe method which could be available to all pregnant women, irrespective of the risk factor and without risk of spontaneous abortion. Although it is known that fetal cells circulate in the blood stream of pregnant women (see Kulozik and Pawlowitzki, "Fetal Cells in the Maternal Circulation: Detection by Direct AFT- mnunofhiorescence," Human Genetics 62:221-224 (1982)), fetal cells are present in such low concentrations that the procedures necessary to isolate them are extremely difficult and time-consuming. For example, Herzenberg et al, "Fetal Cells in the Blood of Pregnant Women: Detection and Enrichment by
