<ABSTRACT>
A receiver (404) capable of receiving transmitted coded 
message signals during a predetermined one of a plurality of 

coded transmission slots transmitted on each of a plurality of 
channels (102-108) has an output (406) that detects channel 

identification information (208) and a memory (422) for storing 
predetermined channel identification information and active 

channel information indicating the active channels of the 
plurality of channels (102-108) capable of being received for 

at least one geographic area. Channel selecting means (426), 
further responsive to the active channel information, selects 

reception by the receiver (404) of only the active channels in 
the particular geographical area when the channel 

identification information (208) detected on the predetermined 
one of the plurality of channels (102-108) does not match 

predetermined channel identification information, whereby power 
consumption of the receiver is reduced, as exemplified in

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to electromagnetic
wave receivers operating in multiple frequency messaging
systems and is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to
a battery saving technique for electromagnetic wave receivers
capable of selectively scanning a plurality of frequencies and
receiving messages provided thereon.Numerous messaging systems are in operation today
providing for the delivery of numeric and alphanumeric messages
to electromagnetic wave receivers, such as communication
receivers and pagers. These messaging systems provide varied
operating characteristics, such as those regarding message
throughput, paging receiver battery saving, local and area-wide
paging or local and nation-wide paging capabilities. These
systems may be further characterized by providing these
capabilities on single or multiple frequencies, or channels.
Of those systems in operation today, most can be characterized
as primarily single frequency systems. Examples of single
frequency systems include such systems as simulcast
transmission systems which utilize such binary signalling
formats as the Golay Sequential Code (or GSC signalling
format), the POCSAG signalling format and the Nippon Telephone
and Telegraph (or NTT) signalling format. These systems are
further characterized as providing synchronous or asynchronous
operation for message delivery. The Golay Sequential Code and
POCSAG signalling formats are used in asynchronous systems,
while the NTT signalling format provides for synchronous system
operation.A number of systems in use provide multiple frequency
operation to facilitate area-wide or nation-wide paging. 
Examples of such multiple frequency systems include those
operated by the British Post Office, or BPO signaling format,
and the Dutch Post Office, or PTT, signaling format. Both
systems utilize multiple frequencies, and transmitter frequency
switching to achieve the required coverage locally and
nationwide.Other systems have also been proposed which utilize one or
more of the previously mentioned signaling formats, to provide
nationwide paging capability.GB-A-2 164 218 discloses a receiver as specified
in the preamble of claim 1, which has a battery saving mode.EP Patent Application No. 0 281 150 describes a method of
frequency division multiplex so as to preclude the simultaneous
transmission of information on the same channel in a plurality
of geographic areas.US Patent No. 4 644 347 describes a multiple frequency
receiver which comprises a decoder which is responsive to a
transmitted
