<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to create a device for ramming pole foundations which limits idle times between ramming operations. Rails (2) on which a self-propelled rail-road vehicle can be driven are laid on a ballast (1). The rail-road vehicle (3) can swivel over 360 DEG  with its top (4) in relation to the undercarriage (5). An operation cabin (6), the counter-weight (7) and the hoisting arm (8) are arranged on the top (4). The turning and tilting unit (9) is provided at the free end of the hoisting arm (8). The leader (11) with the rammers (12) is mounted in a guiding unit (10). In the working position, the leader (11) stands vertically and the top (4) is turned over 90 DEG  with respect to the direction of the rails. When the ramming operation is finished, the leader (11) is centrally clamped by the guiding unit (10) and is turned over 90 DEG  by the turning and tilting unit (9). The leader (11) with the rammers (12) is then shouldered by the hoisting arm (8) and the device can thus be driven to the next ramming position.

Apparatus for driving a foundation, preferably for a 
mast, in particular for an overhead line or aerial line mast, 

wherein the foundation can be rammed into the ground by a 
pile-driving hammer (12) provided on a support (11) and the 

support (11) is provided on a carrier machine (3) via a 
lifting arm (8) pivotal in the vertical plane, the carrier 

machine (3) consisting, in particular, of a chassis (5) and a 
rotatable attachment (4), and the lifting arm (8) is arranged 

pivotally with one end on the carrier machine (3), 
characterized in that a rotating-pivoting unit (9) consisting 

of a positioning plate (15), a rotating plate (17) and a guide 
unit (10) for the support (11) is arranged at the free end of 

the lifting arm (8) for positioning the support (11) in any 
three-dimensional location. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
positioning plate (15) is rigidly connected on one side to the 

rotating plate (17) and is pivotally mounted on the lifting 
arm (8). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
positioning plate (15) has at least one plate (21) in the form 

of a right-angled triangle and this plate (21) is fastened on 
the rotating plate (17) with its longer cathetus, and the 

pivot (16) with the lifting arm (8) is arranged close to the 
centre of the hypotenuse. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
plate (21) has, in the hypotenuse corners, articulations (18, 

19) for hydraulic pivot actuation, the hydraulic cylinder (20) 
being articulated to the lifting arm (8) by its other end. 
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the rotating plate (17) has a crown  

 
wheel and is movable via a hydraulic motor, the angle of 

rotation for the support (11) being at least 90Â°.
