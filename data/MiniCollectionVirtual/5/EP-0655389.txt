<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for the packaging of a roll of web material, in which the roll of web material is unwound from an unrolling station (7) for the packaging web (11) and is fed to a winding station (3) via a predrawing device (12), a knock-off device (13) and a bonding device (14), are specified. Before entering the winding station, the packaging web (11) is made tacky on its top side. A packaging of this type is to be capable of being produced at a low outlay in terms of construction and maintenance, in such a way that it can easily be disposed of. For this purpose, a packaging web (11) coated at least on one side with a water-soluble adhesive is used, and the adhesive, before being applied to the roll of web material (2), is wetted in the bonding device (14).

Method for the packaging of a material web reel, in 
which the material web reel (2) is enveloped with a 

width adapted to the width of the material web reel by 
a packaging web (11), the surface of which is rendered 

adhesive at least in sections before being placed on 

the material web reel, characterised in that a 
packaging web (11) coated on at least one side with a 

water-soluble adhesive (19) is used and the adhesive 
is moistened before being placed on the material web 

reel. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that a 
water-soluble cold-setting glue is used as adhesive 

(19). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
cold-setting glue is essentially a product of animal 

origin based on gelatine or a product of vegetable 
origin based on dextrin. 
Method according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that for moistening, water is sprayed 

on to the adhesive (19). 
Method according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that for moistening, the packaging 

web (11) is led through a roller coating mechanism 
(21). 
Method according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that in the longitudinal and/or 

transverse direction of the packaging web (11) the 
moistening is restricted to predetermined regions. 
Device for the packaging of a material web reel having  
 

at least an unwinding station (7) for a packaging web 
(11), a drawing device (12), a severing device (13), 

an adhesion mediating device (14) and a wrapping 
station (3), the packaging web having a width adapted 

to the width of the material web reel (2) being 
capable of being guided from the unwinding station 

through the remaining devices to the wrapping station, 
characterised in that in the unwinding station (7) at 

least one packaging web (11) coated with a water-soluble 
adhesive (19) is accommodated and that the 

adhesion mediating device (14) is constructed as a 
water-application device (20, 21). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
adhesion mediating device (14) has a water spray 

device (20). 
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
water spray device (20) produces a spray jet the width 

of which can be adjusted. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
water spray device (20) is subdivided over the width 

of the packaging web (11) into several sections (26), 
the water supply of which can be controlled 

separately. 
Device according to one of the Claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that the adhesion mediating device 

(14) has a roller coating mechanism (21). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterised in that 
the roller coating mechanism (21) is arranged behind 

the water spray device (20) in the direction of motion 
of the packaging web (11) and has a controlled press 

roller (33).
