<DESCRIPTION>
 TRANSCODER-FREE OPERATION IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to digital telecommunication systems, and in particular to a transcoder-free operation in mobile communication systems.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTOne existing telecommunications system is the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) which provides a user with a mobile telephone with access to other mobile telephones and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) .In a GSM network, a part of which is schematically illustrated in Figure 3, a mobile terminal (mobile station, MS) communicates with a base transceiver station (BTS) which provides and manages the air interface between the mobile terminal (MS) and the GSM network switching sub-systems. The data, for example speech data, received from the mobile terminal during a connection (a call, e.g.) is passed by a BTS and a base station controller (BSC) to a mobile switching centre (MSC) by way of a transcoding unit (TRAU) , the operation of which will be explained later. The mobile switching centre (MSC) includes a group switch and a switching controller (not shown in Fig. 3) which controls the routing of the speech data received from the mobile terminal (MS) to another MSC via the inter-MSC E-interface, to the PSTN or to another BSC connected to that MSC. Typically, an MSC is connected to a number of base station controllers (BSC) which are in turn connected to a number of base transceiver stations (BTS) providing coverage for a large number of mobile terminals (MS) .As mentioned above, and as is well known, the mobile switching centre (MSC) has a group switch for switching 

signals, and a switching controller which controls the group switch to switch data (speech data, e.g.) associated with connections (calls, e.g.) through the MSC. The switching controller controls the switching/routing of the connection through the group switch and for most connections the switching controller does not alter the data switched through the group switch. In this situation, the mobile switching centre is said to be "transparently" through-connecting the data path associated to the connection. However, in some situations the switching controller adds supplementary services to the connection data (speech data, e.g.). When supplementary services are added, the (data path associated to the) connection is no longer transparently connected through the MSC group switch. The term "supplementary services" is used herein to indicate that the connection is not
