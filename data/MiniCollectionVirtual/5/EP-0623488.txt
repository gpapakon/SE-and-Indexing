<ABSTRACT>
The device for stabilising the platform of a carrying vehicle under load is noteworthy in that it comprises, starting from the carrying chassis (2), and transversely, at least one profiled cross member of hollow cross-section (4) emerging close to or above the wheel set or wheel sets (3) of the carrying vehicle, the said cross member receiving, at its ends (4.1), with adjustable internal sliding, two horizontal extension bars (5) which overhang outwards and which receive, at their ends (5.3), articulated arms (7) which are designed to receive, themselves, complementary wheels (8) for resting on the ground, contributing to the stabilisation of the platform while allowing the towing vehicle to come close to the load to be transferred.
