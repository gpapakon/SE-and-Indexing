components are present in concentrations of 0.05-10.00 % 
by weight, preferably 0.1-5.0 % by weight, and the α,ω-alkanedicarboxylic 

acid or the α,ω-alkanedicarboxylic 
acids are present in concentrations of 0.01-10.00 % by 

weight, preferably 0.05-5.0 % by weight, in each case 
based on the total weight of the formulations. 
Cosmetic deodorants according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the content of

I) α,ω-alkanedicarboxylic acids and 
II) wool wax acids or wool wax acid components, 
 
which can be present, if appropriate, in a suitable 

cosmetic carrier, for combating Gram-positive, in particular 
coryneform bacteria, for combating the body odour 

caused by microbial decomposition of apocrine perspiration.
