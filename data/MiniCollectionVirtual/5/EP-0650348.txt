<DESCRIPTION>
GLUCOMANNAN SPONGEOUS MATRICESThis invention relates to articles of manufacture comprising spongeous matrices formed from coprocessed mixtures of a glucomannan, especially konjac derived glucomannan, and at least one other hydrocolloid; processes for fabrication of the spongeous matrices; and uses for the spongeous matrices.Gels prepared from aqueous sols of konjac glucomannan are known in the art. Japanese published patent application 59-146560 discloses a spongy, porous konjac glucomannan as a food additive. Japanese published patent application 60-83564 discloses a water- resistant food wrap containing konjac which "becomes a water-resistant gel upon freezing." The thawed gel is then dried to produce the food wrap. Similarly, Japanese published patent application 60-141250 discloses the production of konjac which is water insoluble and which does not absorb water, by drying or freezing an alkaline sol or paste of konjac. Japanese published patent application 59-227267 relates to a method of freezing konjac to produce a product stable at a pH of 10.0 to 12.2. See also Japanese published patent application 59-227267 which discloses a method of freezing, drying or dehydrating konjac to produce a water insoluble or non-plastic product.Gels containing agar or agarose are also known to the art. U.S. patent 4,755,377 discloses aerated agar gels formed by mixing gaseous components into the sol before gelation. Gels containing agarose are commercial products and are the subject of various patents.Also known in the art are multi-component gels containing konjac and one or more other components such as starch (Japanese published patent application 62- 259550) , alginic acid or starch with xanthan or 

galactomannan (Japanese published patent application 01-166378) , locust bean gum, plant protein and millet jelly(Japanese published patent application 63-79572) , a milk-type material (Japanese published patent application 62-107751) , alginic acid and propylene glycol, starch and sodium glycolate, and starch and a sodium stearate ester (Japanese published patent applications 62-272952 and 62-195264) , frozen bean curd(Japanese published patent application 62-118859) , and various carrageenans (U.S. patent 4,427,704).In addition, gels made from certain derivatives of konjac (with or without other components) are also known (Japanese patents 01-160467, 01-160468 and 02-150402).In a first article embodiment, this invention comprises an article of manufacture which is a spongeous matrix, whose pores may be
