<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pick-up roll 
apparatus for picking up a tail of a web from a forming 
wire. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
pick-up roll apparatus which transfers the tail to a press 
felt which wraps around a portion of the pick-up roll 
apparatus. In the papermaking art, a web is formed on a 
fourdrinier wire by ejecting stock onto the wire and 
draining water from the stock through the wire. Subsequently, the partially dewatered web is 
transferred from the fourdrinier forming wire onto a press 
felt where the web is conveyed between counter-rotating 
press rolls, or the like, for further dewatering the web. Typically, the transfer from the forming wire to a 
press felt is accomplished by means of a pick-up roll, which 
is disposed closely adjacent to the forming wire. The press 
felt wraps around a portion of the pick-up roll such that 
the formed web is disposed between the fourdrinier wire and 
the press felt. In many pick-up rolls, a central core of the pick-up 
roll defines a full-width chamber having an open face 
towards that portion of the pick-up roll wrapped by the 
press felt. The chamber which extends in a cross-machine 
direction is connected to a source of partial vacuum, and 
the core rotatably supports a perforate roll shell such that  
 
as the press felt extends around and wraps the pick-up roll 
shell, the roll shell rotates relative to the pick-up 
chamber. When the pick-up chamber is connected to the 
source of partial vacuum, the full-width sheet is pulled 
towards the press felt so that a transfer of the full-width 
sheet to the press felt is effected. More recently, pick-up rolls have been proposed which 
include not only a pick-up chamber, but also a tail box or 
end box disposed adjacent to one edge of the web. The tail 
box, which is usually approximately 15.2 cm (six inches) in width, is 
connected to a source of partial vacuum so that during a 
transfer operation, a tail cutter disposed upstream relative 
to the pick-up roll cuts a 15.2 cm (six inch) wide tail from the 
formed web. When the tail has been cut, both the tail and the 
remainder of the full-width sheet are discharged to a broke 
pit disposed beneath the fourdrinier wire. The vacuum source is then connected to the tail box so 
that the tail is drawn towards the press felt by the vacuum 
in the tail box, and the tail is guided by the press felt 
through the press section. Once the tail has been stabilized through the press 
section, the tail cutter is moved in a

<CLAIMS>
A papermaking machine having a forming wire (12), a 
press felt (14) and a pick-up roll (10) apparatus for 

picking up a tail (T) of a web (W) from said forming wire 
(12) and for transferring the tail (T) to said press felt 

(14) wrapping around a portion (16) of the apparatus (10), 
said apparatus comprising: 


a perforate rotatable shell (18) disposed adjacent to 
the forming wire (12), said shell (18) having a first and a 

second end (20,22), 
a stationary core (24) disposed within said shell 
(18), said core (24) defining a tail box (26) which is 

boudned by said shell (18), said tail box (26) being 
sector-shaped and disposed adjacent to one end (20) of said 

ends (20,22) of said shell (18), said tail box (26) being 
selectively connected to a source of partial vacuum (28) 

such that when the tail (T) of the web (W) is cut on the 
forming wire (12), the tail (T) is drawn from the forming 

wire (12) onto the press felt (14) which wraps around said 
rotatable shell (18), 
said core (24) also defining a sector-shaped chamber 
(27) extending between said first and said second end 

(20,22) of said shell (18), said chamber (27) being bounded 
by said shell (18), said chamber (27) being connected to 

said source of partial vacuum (28), said tail box (26) and 
said chamber (27) being in fluid communication with each 

other, and 
said core (24) further defining an upstream chamber 
(50), said upstream chamber (50) being sector-shaped and 

extending between said first and said second ends (20,22) 
of said shell (18), said upstream chamber (50) being 

disposed upstream relative to said chamber (27), 
  
 

   characterized in that the cross section of the sector 
defined by the tail box (26) is substantially equal to the 

total cross section of the sectors defined by both said 
chamber (27) and said upstream chamber (50), 


the vacuum is applied simultaneously to said tail box 
(26) and to said chamber (27) during a tail widening 

operation so that, during widening of the tail (T) to a 
full width sheet, a flow of air through the press felt (14) 

and through said perforate shell (18) towards said chamber 
(27) urges the widened tail (WT) towards the press felt 

(14), the arrangement being such that any tendency for the 
tail (T) to detach for the press felt (14) in the vicinity 

of said tail box (26) during the widening of the tail (T) 
is inhibited, 
said upstream chamber (50) is connected to a further 
source of partial vacuum (52) different from said source of 

partial vacuum (28), the arrangement being such that when 
the tail (T) has been widened to a full width sheet (FWS), 

the upstream chamber (50) is connected to said further 
source of vacuum (52) for urging the full width sheet (FWS) 

away from the forming wire (12) and towards the press felt 
(14) so that the full width sheet (FWS) is transferred from 

the forming wire (12) onto the press felt (14), and 
said further source of partial vacuum (52) is at a 
higher vacuum level than said source of partial vacuum (28) 

applied to said tail box (26) and said chamber (27) for 
urging the web (W) towards the press felt (14) during 

widening of the tail (T) to a full width web. 
A papermaking machine as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that said rotatable shell (18) defines an 

inner and an outer surface (38,40), said shell (18) also 
defining a plurality of holes (41-43), each hole extending 

from said inner (38) to said outer surface (40), said holes  
 

(41-43) being located over the entire outer surface of said 
shell (18). 
A papermaking machine as set forth in claim 1, 
charac
terized in that said stationary core (24) further 
includes:
 
   a first and a second journal (44,46) disposed 

respectively in the vicinity of said first and second end 
(20,22) of said rotatable shell (18) for rotatably 

supporting said shell (18) such that said shell (8) is 
permitted to rotate relative to said core (24). 
A papermaking machine as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that said chamber (27) is disposed 

adjacent to a portion (16) of said rotatable shell (18) 
wrapped by the press felt (14) and immediately upstream 

from where the press felt (14) diverges from said shell 
(18) following said wrapped portion (16).
