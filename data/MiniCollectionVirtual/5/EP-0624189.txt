<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining precursors of cytolytic T cells and the frequency of these precursors, where the cytolytic T cells which develop therefrom are specific to antigens associated with or characteristic of the tumors. The method involves contacting peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMC) containing sample to a source of antigen characteristic of or associated with the tumor, such as non viable tumor cells. The PBMCs, if precursors are contained therein, react and cytolytic T cells develop. These can then be determined by assaying for lysis of tumor cells introduced to the mixture. The methodology can be used for monitoring patient response to various therapeutic regimes.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR DETERMINING CYTOLYTIC T CELL PRECURSORS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to methods for determining precursors of cytolytic T cells specific for antigens characteristic of or specific to tumors. More particularly, it relates to a non-obvious application and modification of the "limiting dilution" assay to determine the precursors discussed above. The applications include the ability to monitor therapeutic regimes and subject response, to particular treatments, including immune responses. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTThe ability to measure and assay events that occur in an immunological response is of great interest and importance in studying the course of a pathological condition or disease.Where a T-cell response is involved, of course, measurement and study of T cells is of concern.T cells constitute a mixture of various types of lymphocytes, including cytolytic T cells, or "CTLs" as these will be referred to hereafter. CTLs interact with a molecule presented by their target cell via the T cell receptor. Following the interaction, the CTL causes the target cell to lyse.The actual target recognized by the CTL is frequently referred to as an antigen, and this term will be used hereafter.Prior work has established that various tumors can and do present antigens which can be the subject of a T-cell mediated response, leading to and rejection. Early work by Prehn et al., J. Nat. Cane. Inst. 18: 769-778 (1957); Klein et al., Cane. Res. 20: 1561-1572 (1960); Old et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 101:80-106 (1962); Kripke et al., J. Nat. Cane. Inst. 53: 1333- 1336 (1974), and Van Pel et al., J. Exp. Med. 157: 1992-2001 (1983) have established that the antigens expressed by these cells, now collectively referred to as "tumor rejection antigens", exist on murine tumors induced by viruses. 

 chemicals, and ultra-violet radiation, as well as on spontaneous tumors. It has also been shown that, in some tvunor systems, these tumor rejection antigens induce cytolytic T cell responses and highly specific CTLs, directed against murine tvunor rejection antigens have been isolated. See Brunner et al. , J. Immunol. 124: 1627-1634 (1980). The target antigen of these CTLs is relevant for recognition by a syngeneic host, since tumor cells which escape partial immune rejection in vivo have been found to have masked or to have lost the antigen CTLs recognize. See Uyttenhove et al., J. Exp. Med. 157: 1040-1052 (1983). Adoptive transfer with cloned CTLs can eradicate tvunor cells in animals bearing large tumors.
