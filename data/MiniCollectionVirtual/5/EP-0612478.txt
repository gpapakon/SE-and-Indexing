<DESCRIPTION>
In the preparation of confectionery products based on 
chocolate or chocolate-like materials, fats are applied 
that need tempering. Tempering is a time-consuming process 
wherein the temperature of the product is increased and 
decreased during time intervals to bring the cocoa butter 
and/or cocoa butter equivalent present in the confectionery 
fat into the desired stable crystal form in order to avoid, 
or at least inhibit, bloom formation of the fat in the 
confectionery product upon storage.  
 EP 293,194 discloses the problem, related to the use of 
PUFA-rich fats in chocolate-fats or in confectionery 
filling fats. It is said, that it is difficult to combine 
increased PUFA-levels of the fats with good product-performance, 
such as meltdown, solid fat content, 
processing-conditions, crystallisation behaviour etc. 
According to EP '194 a solution was found by combining 
cocoabutter replacement fats, such as palm oil midfraction 
(so our component B), with a hard fat, having at least 
50 wt% StOSt and/or PoSt and with a softening fat. 
Softening fats are fats high in PUFA, which also can 
contain some butterfat. However it is also indicated that 
softening fats can be butterfat or fractions thereof (so 
our component C). The weight ration palm mid fraction: hard 
fat can range from 1:4 to 4:1. The amount of liquid oil can 
range from 4-50% based on total fat-composition. Above 
compositions however do not solve the problem of how to 
combine short temper times with good gloss and 
bloomperfermance, without the composition becoming too 
hard.  
 Although it is known that addition of certain fat 
components to the cocoa butter or coco butter equivalent 
can decrease the tempering time, addition of these 
components so far led to the formation of chocolate(-like) 
products that were too soft at temperatures between 15 and 
25°C and/or that demonstrated bloom formation within 3 
months' storage time. Therefore, we have conducted a study to find out whether it 
would be possible to produce fat components based on cocoa 
butter and/or cocoa butter equivalents that could combine 
shorter tempering times with good product performance 
(= bloom and hardness). The above-mentioned study has resulted in our invention. 
According to our invention fat compositions were found that 
are suitable for use in chocolate or chocolate-like 
materials comprising components A, B and C, wherein : 
A = vegetable fat having a weight ratio between 
saturated fatty acid residues (= CSAFA) and unsaturated 
fatty acid residues
