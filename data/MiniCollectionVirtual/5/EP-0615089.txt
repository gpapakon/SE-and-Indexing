<ABSTRACT>
A releasable plug-in connection for joining a pipeline or hose line (14) onto a receiving part (2) has a plug-in part (1) which is connected to the line, can be pushed in the axial direction into a receiving opening (2a) of the receiving part (2) and is locked in the pushed-in position by a slit ring (3). The internal diameter of the slit ring is smaller, in the relieved state, than the external diameter of a collar (7, 8) which is provided on the plug-in part (1). The slit ring (3) is arranged in a circumferential groove (13) of the receiving opening (2a) of the receiving part (2), the groove base of which has a diameter which is greater than the external diameter of the slit ring, both in the relieved state and in the widened state for releasing the collar. An axially displaceable sleeve (15) serves to widen the slit ring (3) to such an extent that the ring, in the widened state, releases the collar (7, 8) for the plug-in part (1) to be drawn out of the receiving part (2).
