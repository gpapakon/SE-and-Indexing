<ABSTRACT>
A holding device (10) for cutting a toric lens for holding 
a lens workpiece (16) in forming a toric lens by cutting the 

lens workpiece (16) comprising: a chuck member (14) for holding the 
lens workpiece (16); a guide member (42) having a circular guide 

hole (40) provided outside of the chuck member (14); a chuck 
support member (60) provided in the circular guide hole (40) of the 

guide member (42) rotatably around a rotation major axis (22) 
eccentric to a center axis of the circular guide hole (40) and 

displaceably on a displacement straight line orthogonal 
to the rotation major axis (22) and rotating with the rotation 

major axis (22), said chuck member (14) being displaced on the 
displacement straight line in accordance with a rotation 

of the chuck support member (60) relative to the guide member (42) 
through guiding end portions of the chuck support member (60) 

along an inner peripheral face of the guide hole (40) thereby 
supporting the chuck member (14) such that the chuck member (14) is 

capable of being eccentric to the rotation major axis (22); 
and a control mechanism (56) for controlling a distance of 

eccentricity between the center axis of the guide hole (40) of 
the guide member (42) and the rotation major axis (22) by moving 

the guide member (42) relatively to the rotation major axis (22) in 
a direction orthogonal to the rotation major axis (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a holding device which is 
employed for holding a lens workpiece in cutting an 
optical lens such as a contact lens, an intraocular lens 
or the like, particularly to a holding device 
employed in making an 
optical lens having a toric shape as per the preamble of the single 
claim. An example of such an apparatus is given by US-A-3 066 560. Conventionally, in the field of optics, especially 
the field of a lens for an eye in the ophthalmology, 
other than a simple spherical lens, an optical lens 
having a toric shape has been employed as a contact lens 
for correction of astigmatism or the like. Conventionally, various methods have been proposed as 
methods for making a toric lens, for instance, in 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 12742/1988, 
wherein a lens workpiece is driven to rotate around an 
axis and its surface is spherically cut by a cutting bit, 
under a state wherein a roughly machined lens workpiece 
is deformed in compression or bending in the radial 
direction.  
 However, in such a method, a lens product of high 
quality is difficult to obtain, since the lens workpiece 
is forcibly deformed which adversely influences on the 
lens workpiece such as causing strain or the like. Further, a method of making an aspherical lens has 
been proposed in U.S.P. 4,947,715 and U.S.P. 4,884,482, 
wherein a lens workpiece is held by a holding device and 
is rotated around an axis, and a cutting bit is swung 
around an axis which is orthogonal to the rotating axis 
of the lens workpiece, while contacting the cutting bit 
to the lens workpiece, thereby cutting the surface of the 
lens workpiece. The rotation angle of the lens workpiece 
and the swing angle of the cutting bit are detected. The 
lens workpiece (holding device) is reciprocated toward 
and away from the cutting bit by a predetermined amount 
in accordance with the swing angle of the cutting bit. However, considering an economical cutting speed of 
the lens workpiece by the cutting bit, it is necessary to 
rotate the lens workpiece at a high speed of at least 
1000 rpm or more. Accordingly, it is necessary to 
reciprocate the lens workpiece and the holding device 
holding the lens workpiece at a rate of 2000 times or 
more per minute. To reciprocate the holding device 
having a rotation driving mechanism at such a high rate, 
it is necessary to provide a driving device having an 
extremely large output. In addition thereto, a vibration 
(deviation) around an axis of a rotating shaft is apt to  
 
amplify in

inner peripheral face of the circular guide hole (40); 
whereby the dimension, in the displacement direction, of the chuck support member 
(60) is a little smaller than the diameter of the circular guide hole (40) of the guide 

member (42); and 
whereby the radii of curvature of the two arcuate end faces are a little smaller than the 
radius of the guide hole (40).
