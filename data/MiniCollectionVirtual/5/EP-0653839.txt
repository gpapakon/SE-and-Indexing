<ABSTRACT>
When input data are received at a rate of f
SL
, (M-N) pieces of 0 data are inserted every N pieces of the input 
data by an interpolation processing circuit (20) to generate data at a rate of f
SH
, and M coefficient generators (30A) to 
(30D) sequentially generates filter coefficients at the rate of f
SH
. The data generated at the rate f
SH
 by the interpolation 
circuit (20) is multiplied by each filter coefficient sequentially given by the coefficient generator (30A) to (30D) by 

M multipliers (41A) to (41D). The outputs from the multipliers (41A) to (41D) are delayed by a unit time by (M-1) 
delay circuits (42A) to (42C) and are summed by (M-1) addition circuits (43A) to (43C), respectively. The N:M (N 
<
 
M) up-rate conversion as described above is carried out by a post-register type transversal filter (40), which produces 

data at the rate of f
SH
 in response to input data received at the rate of f
SL
.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rate converter for converting
the rate of data for exchanging data between digital circuits
operating at two different clock rates, and to an imaging
apparatus provided with the rate converter.In general, for exchanging data between two digital circuits
operating at different clock rates, a rate converter is needed
for converting the data rate.For example, when exchanging digital video signals between
a digital video signal processing circuit of an imager operating
at a clock rate of 18 Mhz and a digital video signal processing
circuit of a digital video tape recorder (RVTR) operating at a
clock rate of 13.5 Mhz pursuant to D1 standard, a rate converter,
such as a 4:3-down rate converter for converting the rate of
digital video signal outputted from the imager from 18 Mhz to
13.5 Mhz, or a 3:4-up rate converter for converting the rate of
digital video signals outputted from the DVTR from 13.5 Mhz to
18 Mhz, is needed.The imager employing a solid-state imaging device usually
has a clock rate determined by the number of pixels of the solid-stat
imaging device. For example, with an imager employing
500,000 pixel solid imaging devices, the digital video signal
processing circuit operates at a clock rate of 18 Mhz.With the conventional rate converter, output data of a
desired output clock rate is obtained by upconverting input data 
to a clock rate equal to the least common multiple of the input
clock rate and the output clock rate and by thinning out via a
filter. Thus the conventional rate converter is in need of
filtering at the output clock rate equal to the above-mentioned
least common multiple.For example, with a 4:3-down rate converter, input data at
the 18 Mhz clock rate is converted by the filtering shown in
Figs.1 and 2 into output data having the clock rate of 13.5 Mhz.That is, with the 4:3-down rate converter, zero data is
inserted at the positions of 18 Mhz clock rate input data {Xm}
shown at A in Fig.1 which can become sampling points for 13.5 Mhz
as shown at B in Fig.1 for upconverting the input data to the
clock rate of a frequency equal to the least common multiple of
18 Mhz and 13.5 Mhz, that is 54 Mhz. Thus, in the frequency
domain, the frequency components repeated on the basis of 18 Mnz
as shown at A in Fig.2 are now repeated at the unit of repetition
of 54 Mhz, with the frequency characteristics remaining
unchanged, as shown at B in Fig.2.The 54 Mhz clock rate data is then passed through a filter
having characteristics shown at C in Fig.1 and at C in Fig.2.
