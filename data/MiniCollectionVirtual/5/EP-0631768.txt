<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent core comprises, in sequence through its 
thickness, a first structure comprising an upper layer 

comprising a first fibrous material (3) having a wet 
compressibility of at least 5 cm³g⁻¹ and a drip capacity of 

at least 10g g⁻¹, the structure also comprising a first 
superabsorbent material (5) having a substantially non-decreasing 

dynamic swelling rate and a second structure 
comprising a second fibrous material (6) and a second 

superabsorbent material (7) having a dynamic swelling rate 
of at least 0.2g g⁻¹ s⁻¹ and an absorption against pressure 

of at least 15g g⁻¹ at 50g cm⁻² (0.7psi), wherein the 
dynamic swelling rate of the first superabsorbent material 

is not greater than 2/3 of the dynamic swelling rate of the 

second superabsorbent material. 
The absorbent core allows improved fluid handling of 
body discharges throughout the core and in the subsequent 

efficient storage of these discharges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent core for
use in articles such as disposable diapers, incontinence
articles, sanitary towels, training pants and the like,
having improved fluid handling properties.Typically absorbent articles of this kind comprise a
liquid pervious topsheet that faces the wearer's body, a
liquid impervious backsheet that faces the wearer's
clothing, and an absorbent core interposed between the
liquid pervious topsheet and the liquid impervious
backsheet. The absorbent core must be capable of absorbing
and handling relatively large volumes of fluid and other
exudates discharged from the body of the wearer, and
especially relatively large fluid volumes discharged over
relatively short periods of time. The absorbent core needs
to be capable of acquiring, distributing, and storing
discharges initially deposited on the topsheet of the
absorbent article. Preferably the design of the absorbent
core is such that the core acquires the discharges
substantially immediately after they have been deposited on
the topsheet of the absorbent article, with the intention
that the discharges do not accumulate on or run off the
surface of the topsheet, since this may result in
inefficient urine containment by the absorbent article
which may lead to wetting of outer garments and discomfort
for the wearer. In addition, preferably the absorbent core
will have a design that facilitates the initially retained
discharges to be transported away from the area of initial
retention to a place within the core where they can be
stored, so that regions of the core do not become
prematurely saturated and so that bulk of the absorbent
material in the core is utilised effectively.There have been many attempts to design an absorbent
core to satisfy, or improve, the above requirements. For
example, WO92/11831 discloses an absorbent article having 
an absorbent core that comprises a wrapped multi-layer
absorbent body comprising at least one
acquisition/distribution layer for acquiring body
discharges; at least one storage layer positioned subjacent
each acquisition layer, and having a further storage layer
subjacent the wrapped multi-layer body. This prior art forms the
preamble of independent claim 1.The acquisition/distribution layer comprises a low
density web or batt of material that can be fibrous non-woven
material. The layer can contain a small amount
absorbent gelling material, provided it does not affect its
acquisition/distribution properties. The storage layers
comprise "high speed" absorbent gelling
