<ABSTRACT>
A polyetheresteramide having good heat resistance, 
permanently antistatic property and superior compatibility 

with thermoplastic resins and a resin composition containing 
the polyetheresteramide are disclosed. The 

polyetherester-amide consists essentially of a polyamide 
oligomer with carboxylic chain ends having a number average 

molecular weight between 200 to 5,000 and a bisphenol compound 
with oxyalkylene units having a number average molecular 

weight between 300 to 3,000. Antistatic resin compositions 
with good antistatic property and heat resistance are obtained 

from compositions comprising 3 to 40 % by weight of the 
polyetheresteramide and 60 to 97 % by weight of thermoplastic 

resins. The antistatic resin compositions can contain as 
compatibilizers vinyl polymers having functional groups such 

as carboxyl and epoxy groups or block polymers containing 
polyolefin blocks and aromatic vinyl polymer blocks. 
To further improve the antistatic property of the resin 
composition a composition comprising at least 97 % by weight 

of the polyetheresteramide and at least 0.01 % by weight of an 
alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide can be used in the 

same way as the polyethersteramide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyetheresteramide and 
antistatic resin compositions compounded therewith. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a polyetheresteramide 
with high heat resistance, permanently antistatic property and 
superior compatibility with thermoplastic resins, and 
resin compositions with antistatic property compounded therewith. Polyetheresteramides have been known as antistatic 
agents for thermoplastic resins. For example, GB-A-2063279 
discloses a polyetheresteramide synthesized from polyamide 
forming components, polyoxyalkylene glycols and dicarboxylic 
acids. US-A-5096995 and JP-A-01-045429 describe a transparent polyetheresteramides 
obtained by the polycondensation of polyamide forming 
components, polyoxyalkylene polyols of relatively low 
molecular weight containing aromatic rings such as alkylene 
bisphenyl group, polyoxyalkylene glycols and dicarboxylic 
acids. EP-A-0303489 and GB-A-2112789 describe resin 
compositions consisting of a polyetheresteramide containing 
polyoxyalkylene chains and a matrix resin such as ABS resin or  
 
polyolefin. Furthermore, JP-A-03-0290464 discloses a thermoplastic 
resin composition consisting of a polyetheresteramide 
synthesized using polyoxyalkylene glycols and polyolefins 
modified with acid anhydride, and US-A-5169899 discloses a 
thermoplastic resin composition consisting of a polyetheresteramide 
synthesized using polyoxyalkylene glycols and styrene 
copolymers modified with rubber. JP-A-01-163234 describes a 
thermoplastic resin composition consisting of a polyetheresteramide 
synthesized using polyoxyalkylene glycols, polyolefins 
and modified polyolefins having functional groups such 
as carboxyl and amino groups. JP-B-04-072855 describes a 
thermoplastic resin composition consisting of a polyetheresteramide 
synthesized using polyoxyethylene glycols, ABS resin 
and modified polyvinyl polymers containing carboxyl groups. 
JP-A-64-062343 discloses resin compositions consisting of 
polyamide elastomers such as polyetheresteramide, antistatic 
agents, alkali metal salts and elastomeric polyolefins which 
are grafted with a combination of vinyl monomers containing 
functional groups such as methacrylic acid and a maleimide 
compound or styrene. However, the polyetheresteramides or the resin 
compositions compounded therewith which are described in the 
references cited above in no way exhibit well-balanced 
antistaticic property, heat resistance. moldability and 
compatibility with thermoplastic resins. For example. the
