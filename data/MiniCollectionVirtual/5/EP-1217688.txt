<ABSTRACT>
A chip antenna comprises an antenna element, and a
dielectric chip having the antenna element buried therein

or stacked on a surface thereof. Particularly, the
dielectric chip has a space area, for example, a flute for

forming an air layer on an underside (in a surface not in
contact with the antenna element). By varying the size of

the flute, the antenna characteristic is tuned while
consistently maintaining the outer dimensions of the chip

antenna and a mounting height for the antenna element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chip antenna which
is so structured as to have an antenna element buried in a
dielectric chip, or an antenna element stacked on the
surface of a dielectric chip, and a method of
manufacturing the chip antenna.As small-size antennas for use in mobile telephones,
portable computers, wireless LAN (local area network)
equipment and the like, attention is paid to a chip
antenna which is comprised of an antenna element buried in
a dielectric chip.The characteristic of a chip antenna varies due to
the influence exerted by a printed circuit board on which
the chip antenna is mounted, and the like. For this reason,
even for use in the same frequency band, a large number of
types of chip antennas must be prepared in accordance with
particular situations in which chip antennas are mounted
on the printed circuit boards. In the past, therefore, a
plurality of types of chip antennas having different
characteristics have been prepared by changing the pattern
shape and dielectric material of the antenna element.
However, the preparation of such chip antennas inevitably
requires tremendous time and labor.It is an object of the present invention to readily
provide chip antennas having a variety of characteristics.A chip antenna according to the present invention is 
so structured as to include an antenna element, and a
dielectric chip having the antenna element buried therein
or stacked on a surface thereof, particularly
characterized in that the dielectric chip is formed with a
space area for forming an air layer or a space area, for
example, a flute, filled with another dielectric material
different in dielectric constant from the dielectric chip.Also, a method of manufacturing a chip antenna
according to the present invention first fits a nest of a
predetermined shape at a site for forming the space area
in a mold for injection molding of the dielectric chip.
Characteristically, after setting an antenna element in
the mold, a dielectric material is injected into the mold
to form the dielectric chip which has the space area for
forming an air layer. Also, characteristically, the nest
fitted in the mold is replaced to manufacture a plurality
of types of chip antennas.Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the
schematic structure of a chip antenna according to a first
embodiment of the present invention;Fig. 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating the
cross-sectional structure of the chip antenna illustrated
in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary method
