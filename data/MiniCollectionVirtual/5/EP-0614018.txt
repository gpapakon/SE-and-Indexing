<ABSTRACT>
A frame profile (1) and a bar profile (2) are connected to one another via two T-connectors (4 and 7) which are fixed on the frame profile (1). Resulting in the joint region is a gap which, according to the invention, is sealed by a sealing cushion (13) fixed on the frame profile (1). The sealing cushion (13) consists of an elastic material, preferably of closed-cell foam. The thickness of the sealing cushion (13) is greater than the gap width, with the result that, after frame profile (1) and bar profile (2) have been fitted together, the sealing cushion (13) is compressed by the bar profile (2) and is pressed firmly onto the frame profile (1). Sealing of the gap region by a sealing cushion (13) can be carried out easily and requires only a low degree of material outlay.

<CLAIMS>
A T-connection between a crossbar member (2) and a frame member
(1), wherein on its side towards the crossbar member (2) the frame

member has at least one groove (3) which extends in the longitudinal
direction of the frame member and in which there is fixed a T-connector

(4) projecting into a hollow chamber (8) in the crossbar member (2), the
lower end face of the crossbar member which is towards the frame member

partially bearing against the upper edges of the groove, and wherein the
gap outside the groove (3) between the bottom of the frame member (1)

and the rest of the end face of the crossbar member (2) is sealed off,
characterised in that for the purposes of sealing off the gap there is

provided at least one sealing pad (13) which is in the form of a shaped
member and which is made from an elastic material and which is fixed in

the joint region to the frame member (1) and that the sealing pad (13)
is thicker than the height of the gap to be sealed off so that the lower

edges of the crossbar member (2) are pressed into the sealing pad (13).
A T-connection according to claim 1 characterised in that the
sealing pad (13) is fixed to the frame member (1) by a narrow seam of a

permanently elastic sealing means (15) which is applied in the bottom of
the groove in the frame member (1).
A T-connection according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in
that the frame member (1) is provided in per se known manner with an

abutment means (5) which is pressed thereagainst and to which there is
fixed a T-connector whose lower end is pressed into the sealing pad

(13).
A T-connection according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised
in that in the case of a relatively wide crossbar member (2) a separate

sealing pad (13) is provided in each edge region as viewed in the
longitudinal direction of the frame member (1). 
A T-connection according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised
in that the sealing pad (13) comprises a closed-cell foam.
