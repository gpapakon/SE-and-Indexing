<ABSTRACT>
In this method which is referred to as an anti-judder function (AG function), a segment time gradient (crank shaft ring gear) is derived from the engine speed (n) and evaluated. When unacceptable vibrations are detected, the torque of the engine (1) is reduced. If the segment time gradient drops below the lower threshold value, an ignition intervention which reduces the engine torque is carried out. If the segment time gradient exceeds the upper threshold value, the ignition intervention is cancelled. The upper and lower threshold values are dependent on the engine speed (n). The ignition intervention is carried out by switching over from a base ignition characteristic diagram (10) to a second ignition characteristic diagram (11) which contains ignition times which have been adjusted in the direction of late. In a first characteristic diagram (12), first threshold values are stored and in a second characteristic diagram (13) second, higher threshold values for the segment time gradient are stored. After an initial triggering of the anti-judder function, the second characteristic diagram (13) is switched over to. Instead of the segment time gradient, an engine speed gradient can also be used, but the upper and lower threshold values must then be interchanged. Moreover, activation and deactivation of the anti-judder function is possible in dependence on the number of the triggerings of the anti-judder function or the time since the first triggering and the operating conditions (e.g. activation when acceleration occurs). The speed of change of the ignition angle is limited in size.

Method for suppressing vibrations in the drive 
train of a motor vehicle, in which a segment time 

gradient (TN_GRD) dependent on the speed (n) of the 
engine (1) is detected and evaluated and the torque of 

the engine (1) is reduced by altering the ignition angle 
if impermissible vibration is detected, the procedure 

being one in which 

if the segment time gradient (TN_GRD) falls below 
the lower threshold value (SU), an ignition intervention 

which reduces the engine torque is carried 
out, i.e. an anti-bucking function is tripped, and 
if the segment time gradient (TN_GRD) exceeds the 
upper threshold value (SO), the ignition intervention 

is cancelled; 
 
the lower and the upper threshold value (SU, SO) being 

specified as a function of the engine speed
 
characterized 


in that first lower threshold values (SU1) are 
stored in a first performance graph (12) and second, 

higher threshold values (SU2) are stored in a second 
performance graph (13), to which a switchover is 

made after the anti-bucking function (AR) is tripped 
for the first time. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a switchover is made back from the second (13) to 

the first performance graph (12) after a predetermined 
number of trippings (ANZ_TRIG_AR) of the anti-bucking 

function or after a predetermined time period 
(T_MAX_KF_AR).  

 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the anti-bucking function is activated if an 

acceleration enrichment (BA) by the engine control system 
is detected, allowing the anti-bucking function to be 

tripped when the lower threshold value (SU) is undershot. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the lower and the upper threshold value (SU, SO) are 

specified as a function of the respectively selected 
gear. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, at low engine speeds, the segment time gradient 

(TN_GRD) is calculated from two successive segments 
(TN
n-1
, TN
n
) and, at high engine speeds, is calculated from 
two successive revolution times (TU
n-1
, TU
n
). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, upon a switchover to the torque-reducing ignition 

performance graph, the ignition angles are retarded and 
in that the amount by which they are retarded is 

dependent on the engine speed (n) and the engine load. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the lower threshold value (SU) assumes higher values 

and the upper threshold value (SO) assumes smaller values 
at higher engine speeds than at low engine speeds. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the adjustment of the ignition angle is delayed by 

a predetermined period of time. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the ignition angles are adjusted back to the original 

value after a predetermined maximum time (T_MAX) has 
been exceeded, even if the upper threshold value is not 

exceeded by the segment time gradient (TN_GRD). 
Engine control system with suppression of vibrations 
in the drive train of a motor vehicle, including 

means which detect and evaluate a segment time gradient 
(TN_GRD) dependent on the speed (n) of the engine (1) and 

reduce the torque of the engine (1) by altering the 
ignition angle if impermissible vibration is detected, 

and with means which  
 


if the segment time gradient (TN_GRD) falls below a 
lower threshold value (SU), trip an anti-bucking 

function i.e. carry out an ignition intervention 
which reduces the engine torque, and 
if the segment time gradient (TN_GRD) exceeds an 
upper threshold value (SO), cancel the ignition 

intervention; 
 
the lower and the upper threshold value (SU, SO) being 

specified as a function of the engine speed,
 
characterized in that it has a first performance graph 

(12), in which first, lower threshold values are stored, 
and a second performance graph (13), in which second, 

higher threshold values are stored and to which switchover 
is made after the anti-bucking function has been 

tripped for the first time.
