<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of differential
apparatus for automotive vehicles. More specifically
the invention relates to a differential apparatus comprising the
features of the preamble portion of claim 1.A differential apparatus 201 as shown in Fig. 1 is
disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai) Application
No. 2-38733. In this differential apparatus 201, a plurality of
pairs of pinion gears 211 and 213 are accommodated in a plurality
of accommodating holes 205 and 207 of a differential casing 203,
respectively. The pinion gears 211 are in mesh with the pinion
gears 213. Further, one side gear 217 is in mesh with the
pinion gears 211, and the other side gear 219 is in mesh with
the pinion gears 213, respectively. In the construction as
described above, when differential motion is generated between
two vehicle wheels linked with the two side gears 217 and 219,
respectively, since the two pinion gears 211 and 213 are rotated
under the condition that two tooth crest surfaces of the pinion
gears 211 and 213 are brought into sliding contact with the
inner wall surfaces of the accommodating holes 205 and 207
respectively, it is possible to generate a differential limiting
force due to the frictional resistance generated at the sliding
surfaces between both, respectively.In the conventional differential gear, however, since a
large frictional forces is generated between the tooth crest
surfaces of the teeth of the pinion gears 211 and 213 and the
inner wall surfaces of the accommodating hole 205 and 207
respectively, in case of insufficient lubrication, there exists
a problem in that the differential limiting characteristics are
not stable because of wear, gall, seizure, abnormal noise, etc.
produced at the respective sliding surfaces between the pinion
gears and the inner walls of the accommodating holes. A differential apparatus according to the features of the preamble portion of claim 1 is
known from FR-A-2 126 823 which teaches oil supply to pinion gears via bores provided
in a differential casing.Another differential apparatus is known from DE-A-23 05 305 which, however, does not
disclose pinion gears accommodated in accommodating holes.As already stated above, such prior art differential apparatus suffer from the drawback
that the differential limiting characteristics are instable because of wear and seizure and,
moreover, may cause abnormal noise at the inner walls of the accommodating holes.Accordingly the technical problem underlying the present invention is to improve a
