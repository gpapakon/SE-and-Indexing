<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an optical data storage 
medium in which a reflecting layer is formed on
 a substrate. A 
dye containing layer having a reflectivity of 15 to 25% is used 

as the reflecting layer, and a signal modulation degree of an 
information signal falls within a range of from 0.3 to 0.6. 

Further, a real number portion n of complex index of refraction 
of the reflecting layer is selected so as to satisfy n ≧ 1.84. 
According to the present invention, there is provided an 
optical data storage medium which can be reproduced by a 

recording and reproducing apparatus which is designed so as to 
record and reproduce a medium such as a magneto-optical disc or 

the like having a reflectivity of about 15 to 25%. Therefore, 
the recording and reproducing apparatus that can record and 

reproduce the medium having the reflecting layer whose 
reflectivity is low can be made small in size and light in 

weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical information
recording medium which can be recorded and/or reproduced by a
magneto-optical recording apparatus.Optical data storage media such as a compact disc (CD), a
laser disc (LD) or the like are now commercially available on the
market. Each of these optical data storage media comprises a
substrate on which concavities and convexities corresponding to
information signals are previously formed, a reflecting layer
formed on the substrate and a protecting layer formed on the
reflecting layer, if necessary. This type of optical data
storage medium is a playback type optical disc from which an
information signal previously recorded can be reproduced only.
The above reflecting layer is made of a material such as Aℓ, Au
or the like having a high reflectivity, i.e., low absorptance.Recently, as an optical data storage medium in which
information can be written and erased unlike the optical
information media such as the CD or the like, the development of
a magneto-optical disc has been promoted. This magneto-optical
disc comprises a substrate and a recording portion formed on the
substrate by laminating a recording magnetic layer (e.g., a rare
earth-transition metal alloy amorphous thin film such as TbFeCo
or the like) having a magnetization easy axis vertical to the
film surface and which has a large magneto-optical effect, a 
reflecting layer and a dielectric layer. As such magneto-optical
disc, a magneto-optical disc (so-called mini-disc) having a
diameter of 64 mm has already been manufactured as popular
magneto-optical discs.If the above-mentioned playback optical disc can be
reproduced by the magneto-optical disc recording and reproducing
apparatus, then the playback optical disc and the magneto-optical
disc system will become more widespread and useful in actual
practice. The playback optical disc whose reflecting layer is
made of a material Aℓ, Au or the like, however, has a
reflectivity of 70% or more relative to a laser light, which
reflectivity is very high as compared with the magneto-optical
disc whose reflectivity lies in a range of from 15 to 25%.EP-A-291848 and EP-A-0514211 show optical data storage media comprising a reflecting layer formed of a dye containing layer. Both documents are concerned with providing highly reflective media.JP-A-60047247 teaches to provide a film containing a dye and having a reflectivity ≤ 20% between the metal substrate of an optical disc and its recording layer so that the disc can be recorded and reproduced in the
