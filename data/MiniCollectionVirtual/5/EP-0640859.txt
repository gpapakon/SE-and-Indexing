<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of this invention is to provide an 
image display unit which is capable of displaying an 

environmental image at the periphery of an image on a 
display screen in order to create an image having 

heightened reality and to provide greater comfort to 
the eyes. The image display unit comprises a liquid-crystal 

display (24) for displaying a main image at a 
central portion of a visual field, a back light (25) 

thereof, a slide (22) for displaying an image at the 
periphery of a main central image, a back light (23) 

thereof and a lens system (21) for magnifying an image 
synthesized from the above-mentioned images. Displaying 

an environmental image at the periphery of an image on 
a display screen in accordance with an observer's 

preference, effectively raises the ambiance of the 
display and increases the comfort of viewing the 

display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image display
unit and, especially, to an image display unit
which is a head-mounted display (HMD) type for seeing
a liquid crystal display through a magnifying lens and
which includes an environmental image display device
for displaying an environmental image at the
peripheral portion of an observer's field of vision in
order to improve the ambiance or which includes an
environmental image synthesizing device for
synthesizing an environmental image around an input
image to increase the ambiance of the input image. The
proposed image display unit is intended for use, e.g.,
in observing TV programs, video programs and
stereoscopic images as well as for displaying an image
with virtual reality, for monitoring TV games and for
monitoring information fed into word processors and
computers.Recently, there has been developed a head-mounted
display (HMD) made on the basis of a miniaturized
liquid-crystal display.All components are mounted in a spectacle-like
casing which is mounted on the head of the observer. 
Each of the two spectacle-like portions of the casing
contain a back light, a liquid-crystal display, a
diaphragm and a lens arranged in said order from the
outside thereof. Therefore, when the observer puts it
on his head, he can see an enlarged image of the
liquid-crystal display.In the above-mentioned conventional head-mounted
display, only an effective area of liquid-crystal
display provided with a back light is made visible
and covered at its periphery by the black
diaphragm. Accordingly, the observer can look at a
screen appearing in the dark.The conventional display or projector is intended
to increase the reality of an image by increasing
the size of its display screen and the conventional
head-mounted display is intended to increase the
ambiance of an image by enlarging it through a
magnifying device.The Japanese laid-open patent application No. 4-106668
describes such a conventional display unit that
operates as follows:
When coordinates of a center image, as positional
information, are entered by an input device, the
center image generating device reads out an image
corresponding to the center portion area specified by
the positional information from the image stored and a 
peripheral image generating device takes out a
peripheral image from the image storage according to
the positional information. An image generating
device synthesizes a final image from the center
portion image prepared by the center image generating
device and a peripheral image
