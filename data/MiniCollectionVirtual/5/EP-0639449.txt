<ABSTRACT>
A juice extractor for extracting juice from juice 
containing material includes a housing (24) whose 

interior communicates with a supply hopper (24) for the 
material and contains two rotatably mounted squeezing 

rollers (20, 22) which include cooperating helical gears 
(16) and a respective screw (18) at their leading end. 

A filter (32) surrounds at least the leading end portions 
of the squeezing rollers. A dregs discharge section (30) 

is provided at the leading end of the housing in which a 
discharge opening (50) is provided. A valve member (52) 

cooperates with the discharge opening (50) and is urged 
into a position in which it closes the discharge opening 

by its engagement by one end of a spring (62). A 
discharge pressure adjusting device (28) includes an 

adjusting member (60) against which the other end of the 
spring bears and which may be moved to vary the force 

exerted by the spring on the valve member (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a juice extractor for 
extracting juice from fruit or vegetable material of the 
type referred to in the precharacterising portion of 
Claim 1. U.S.-A-5156872 discloses a juice extractor of 
the type referred to above which includes a pair of 
rollers constituting helical gears, that is to say gears 
with a plurality of teeth or splines which are inclined 
to the axis of the gear, in engagement with each other. 
Each roller includes a screw or threaded portion at its 
leading or front end. The two rollers are disposed 
within a filter or sieve. This patent teaches that the 
juice containing material, i.e. fruit or vegetable 
material, is squashed or compressed by the pair of 
engaging helical gears and compressed again by the screws 
and juice is expelled from the juice containing material. 
This juice passes through and is filtered by the sieve. However, since the helical gears engage each other, noise 
is generated and metallic powder is generated by abrasion 
of the metal constituting the helical gears during their 
rotation and discharged with the juice. As a result, 
there is a risk that metallic powder may be ingested when 
the user drinks the juice. The sieve is constructed of 
metal plate in which a plurality of minute holes is 
formed to enable the juice to be separated from the 
dregs, i.e. the solid vegetable or fruit material being 
compressed. However, this sieve has the disadvantage that the minute 
holes tend to become clogged by the dregs. The extractor 
and in particular the filter therefore require thorough  
 
washing with water and a brush, after use. The juice 
extractor disclosed in the U.S. Patent includes a 
discharge disc mounted at the dregs discharge outlet. 
This disc includes a resilient movable portion which acts 
as a valve member which moves when the pressure of the 
dregs or solid material is sufficient to permit the dregs 
to be discharged. This disc is in practice found not to 
operate satisfactorily because the discharge pressure of 
the dregs needs appropriate adjustment in accordance with 
the different water content of different juice containing 
materials and also because the resilience of the movable 
portion of the disc changes with time whereby the 
characteristics, particularly the extractive efficiency, 
of the extractor vary with time also. FR-A-963874 discloses an olive press including a housing 
whose interior communicates with a supply hopper and 
contains two rotatable squeezing rollers which include 
cooperating helical

<CLAIMS>
A juice extractor for extracting juice from fruit or 
vegetable material including a housing (24) whose 

interior communicates with a supply hopper (24) for 
material from which juice is to be extracted and contains 

two rotatably mounted squeezing rollers (20, 22) which 
include cooperating helical gears (16) and a respective 

screw (18) at their leading end, a filter (32) 
surrounding at least the leading end portions of the 

squeezing rollers (20, 22), a dregs discharge section 

(30) being provided at the leading end of the housing 
(24) in which a discharge opening (50) is provided, a 

valve member (52) cooperating with the discharge opening 
(50) and being urged towards the closed position, 

characterised in that in a portion (38) of each helical 
gear (16) remote from the screw (18) there is a recess 

(40, 42) in each flank of each gear tooth extending along 
the length of the gear tooth. 
A juice extractor as claimed in Claim 1 
characterised in that a discharge pressure adjusting 

device (28) is arranged to vary the force with which the 
valve member (52) is urged towards the closed position. 
A juice extractor as claimed in Claim 2 
characterised in that the discharge pressure adjusting 

device (28) includes a spring (62) of which one end acts 
on the valve member (52) and the other end acts on an 

adjusting member (60) which is screw threadedly connected 
to the leading end of the housing (24) and may be moved 

towards and away from the housing by rotating it.  
 
A juice extractor, as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the pitch of the 

thread of the screw (18) at the leading end of each 
squeezing roller (22) progressively decreases in the 

leading direction. 
A juice extractor, as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that one of the 

helical gears (16) includes two spaced annular portions 
(34, 36) of synthetic resin material which engage the 

other helical gear (16), the remainder of the first 
helical gear being spaced from the corresponding portion 

of the other helical gear by a predetermined distance of 
e.g. 0.3 to 0.5 mm. 
A juice extractor as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the filter (32) 

is of annular construction and comprises a plurality of 
interconnected elongate resilient filter elements (46), 

in one side of each of which a plurality of grooves or 
recesses (47) is formed, each filter element (46) being 

bent in the middle, the bends in adjacent filter elements 
(46) being in opposite senses.
