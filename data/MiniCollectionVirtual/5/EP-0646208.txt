<ABSTRACT>
A supporting member (3) has two opposite surfaces comprising respective opposite openings (6, 7) and an element to be fastened (1) is provided with an elongate fastening member (4) which is slightly narrower than the openings in the supporting member whereby said fastening member may extend therethrough. A resilient blade (10) is secured to one surface of the supporting member (3) and one of its edges (13) is located in the vicinity of the opening (6). When the fastening member is inserted into the supporting member through said openings, the resilient blade is moved out of its neutral position by the fastening member and its edge engages said fastening member, thus preventing the withdrawal thereof.
