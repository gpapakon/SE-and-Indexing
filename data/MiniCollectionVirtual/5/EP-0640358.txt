<ABSTRACT>
There is described a tube coupling 1 for the releasable connection of a tube 3 coming from a suction device with a drainage tube 5 unreleasably connected to the tube coupling, which is characterised in that a conical connection piece 4 which is arranged on the side PF remote from the patient and ends in a bevel 8 forms a tube reception chamber 13 which widens in the direction PF remote from the patient together with an external housing 11 conically formed on its inner side 12.

<CLAIMS>
A hose coupling (1) for detachably connecting a hose (5) extending from a suction
device, with a drainage hose (3) permanently connected with said hose coupling (1) and

with a hub (4) disposed on the proximal side (PF), one end of said hub having a bevel
(8) and forming, together with an outer housing (11), a hose receiving chamber (13)

open in the proximal direction (PF), characterized in that said hub (4) and the inner side
(12) of said outer housing (11) are conical and said hub (4) is provided with at least one

groove (9) extending on its outer surface in the proximal direction (PF) from about the
center of the hub to the distal end (PN) of said bevel (8).
The hose coupling of claim 1, characterized in that said hub (4) has at least one
lateral flattening (18) in its distal region (PN).
The hose coupling of claim 1, characterized in that said hub (4) has flattenings (18)
regularly distributed about its circumference.
