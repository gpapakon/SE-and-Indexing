<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil-absorbent 
composition, a particulate oil absorber, an oil-absorbent material using 
the oil absorber, and an oil-absorbent pack using the oil absorber or 
the oil-absorbent material. More specifically, it relates to an oil - 
absorbent composition which selectively removes or recovers oil from 
the surface of a liquid of higher specific gravity such as water, excels in 
oil-maintaining properties, and improves oil-absorbing speed. It also 
concerns a particulate oil absorber, an oil-absorbing material using the 
oil absorber, and an oil-absorbent pack using the oil absorber or the 
oil-absorbent material. In recent years, there has been the problem of cleaning up 
oil spills or oil slicks from the surface of water or sea water in view of 
environmental protection. The need for recovery of small volumes of 
waste oils, which are disposed of by homes and industries, and large 
volumes of leakage oils such as machine oil from industries, is also 
recognized. Heretofore, there has been proposed an effective means of 
recovering leakage of oil or spilled oil from the surface with oil 
absorbers, and then calcining the oil absorber or the like. As the oil 
absorber, a synthetic fiber consisting of a hydrophobic fiber such as 
polypropylene fiber, polystyrene fiber, polyethylene fiber or a 
nonwoven was used. However, since such oil absorbers absorb and 
maintain oil in their interstices due to capillary action, they have the 
disadvantages that they fail to substantially maintain oil of low 
viscosity, they are liable to suffer sag due to easy re-bleeding of the 
absorbed oil under a slight external force, and that post treatment is 
very complicated due to the oil maintaining properties after absorption 
of oil.  Further, such oil absorbers absorb not only oil but also 
water if the oil portion in an oil-water mixture or thin oil film, which floats 
on the surface of water or sea water, is recovered. Therefore, 
conventional oil absorbers have the drawbacks that the efficiency of oil 
recovery is weak, the oil absorber is very difficult to recover after it has 
sunk in water or seawater, and the oil absorber so recovered is 
unsuitable for calcination. In order to solve these problems, there have been 
proposed some oil absorbers made of a synthetic resin which absorbs 
oil in its structure causing it to swell. Examples thereof are a t-butylstyrene-divinylbenzene 
copolymer (Japanese Kokoku (Japanese 
patent publication) 45-27081), a t-butyl methacrylate and/or
