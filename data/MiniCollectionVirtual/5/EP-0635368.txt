<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for low cost thermal printing in a thermal printer 
having a software controlled thermal print head that moves in relation to a print ribbon 

disposed adjacent to a print area of a printed medium. The thermal print head is selectively 
energized to heat the print ribbon which dep
osits the ink onto the printed medium as the print 
head moves in relation to the print ribbon in a print stroke. The cost of printing is decreased 

by efficient use of the ink on the print ribbon. Between print strokes, the print ribbon is 
displaced an incremental interval to position an unused portion of the print ribbon for printing 

on the printed medium during a subsequent print stroke. The precise displacement of the 
print ribbon may be software controlled based on the detection of indices disposed at spaced 

intervals along the print ribbon which further increases the efficient usage of ink on the print 
ribbon. The utilization of ink on the print ribbon is made more efficient by a software 

controlled generation of an italic or gray shade character font, which require less ink than 
solid block character fonts. Using less ink on the print ribbon, permits a decrease in the 

print ribbon displacement interval between print strokes, and also permits some portions of 
the print ribbon to be overlapped by the print head during a subsequent print stroke. The 

utilization of ink on the print ribbon may also be made more efficient by mechanical or 
software controlled linear and lateral shifts of the printed characters during subsequent print 

strokes, which permits the utilization of ink between areas on the print ribbon where ink was 
depleted in a previous print stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to thermal printing and, more 
specifically, to a novel method and apparatus for low cost thermal printing in a thermal 
printer having a thermal print head that moves in relation to a print ribbon disposed adjacent 
to a print area of a printed medium, wherein the thermal print head is selectively energized 
to heat the print ribbon which deposits the ink in an intelligible arrangement onto the printed 
medium as the print head moves in relation to the print ribbon. Thermal printers have many applications, one of which is printing one or more 
lines of the text or other information on a printed medium having a plurality of print areas. 
In some applications, the same or different information is printed on the different print areas. 
For example, thermal printers are often employed to print the same expiration date or other 
information on flexible wrappers and packaging for perishable food items and other articles. 
For printing purposes, a plurality of these packages or wrappers, each having a designated 
print area for the printed expiration date or information, may be in the form of a unitary 
printed medium that is fed to the thermal printer for printing, and later processed for 
packaging or shipping. Thermal printers may also be used to print information directly on 
a packaged article or on the article itself. Other applications for print thermal printers 
include printing information on a semi-rigid printed medium for example, a wallet size plastic  
 
card fed to the thermal printer for printing. Print quality requirements also vary from 
application to application. In the expiration date example given above, for instance, a high 
resolution text may not be required, and for economical reasons, a legible, low resolution 
text is often paramount. In other applications, like the wallet size plastic card application, 
it is desirable to print an aesthetic, high resolution text, graphics, or bar codes. These are 
only a few examples of the many applications of thermal printers. Thermal printers generally comprise a thermal print head with an array of 
heating elements that are movable in relation to a print ribbon having a thermally sensitive 
ink layer disposed adjacent to a print area of the printed medium. The print ribbon typically 
comprises a thin ribbon substrate having a layer of thermally sensitive ink disposed on a 
surface thereof. Printing occurs during a print stroke during which the heating elements of 
the print head are selectively energized
