<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns an article sorting method in 
which a plurality of articles different in sorting destination 

are sorted out with one carriage with high efficiency, and an 
article sorting system for practicing the method. The article 

sorting system includes: a carriage (3) movable along a track 
(5); a plurality of conveying means (13a, 13b, 13c and 13d) 

which are provided on the carriage (3), and on which articles 
(11) can be placed; and control means (23) for controlling the 

operations of the plurality of conveying means (13a, 13b, 13c 
and 13d) independently of one another. The control means 

drives the conveying means (13a, 13b, 13c and 13d) individually 
according to the sorting destination data of the articles, so 

that a single or plural articles (11) are sorted out by the 
individual operations or combined operations of the driving 

means (15a, 15b, 15c and 15d).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article sorting method in 
which a variety of articles conveyed on a conveying path are 
sorted out so that they are distributed to other predetermined 
conveying paths, and an article sorting system for practicing 
the method. One example of an article sorting system of this type 
is a travelers' baggage sorting system employed, for instance, 
at air ports. At an air port, it is necessary to sort out 
travelers' baggage according to the travelers' destinations. 
The system operates to sort out pieces of baggage according to 
information given by the destination tags attached thereto. FIG. 8 shows the arrangement of a conventional article 
sorting system 51. As shown in FIG. 8, a carriage 55 is moved 
along a track 53. When the carriage 55 is at a baggage 
receiving station 61, a piece of baggage 57 is loaded on the 
carriage 55 from a loading belt conveyor 67 driven in the 
direction of the arrow "A". Next, the carriage 55 is stopped 
at a baggage transferring station 63 which is selected 
according to the sorting data of the piece of baggage 57. At 
the baggage transferring station 63, a belt conveyor 59 
provided on the carriage 55 is driven so that the piece of 
baggage 57 is unloaded from the carriage 55. More 
specifically, at the baggage transferring station 63, the belt  
 
conveyor 59 of the carriage 55 is driven to move the piece of 
baggage 57 in the direction of the arrow "B", so that the piece 
of baggage 57 is transferred onto a distributing belt conveyor 
65 or a shooter. The track 53 is preferably endless. A number 
of baggage receiving stations 61 and a number of baggage 
transferring stations 63 are provided along the track 53. With the system, it goes without saying that sometimes 
one piece of baggage 57 is loaded on one carriage 55 so as to 
be sorted out, and when plural pieces of baggage to be handled 
have the same destination, then they may be loaded on one 
carriage 55 so as to be sorted out. In the conventional article sorting system, the 
carriage 55 has only one conveyor 59. Therefore, the carriage 
is allowed to transfer a piece or pieces of baggage therefrom 
only in one direction at a time. Hence, in the case where 
pieces of baggage to be handled have different destinations, 
they must be loaded on different, respective carriages. This 
lowers the baggage sorting efficiency undoubtedly. 
Furthermore, in the case where there are a great many pieces of 
baggage to be sorted out, the baggage sorting efficiency cannot 
be increased without

<CLAIMS>
An article sorting method comprising the steps 
of: 


(a) positioning, at an article receiving section, a 
carriage having a plurality of conveying means and movable 

along a track; 
(b) loading one or more articles on selected one or 
ones of said plurality of conveying means provided on said 

carriage thus positioned; and 
(c) positioning said carriage at an article sorting 
section, where selected one or ones of said plurality of 

conveying means are driven independently or cooperatively to 
sort at least one of said article therefrom according to 

sorting destination data of said articles. 
The method according to claim 1, further 
comprising, between the steps (b) and (c), the steps of: 

   moving said carriage from said article receiving 
section to said article sorting section along said track. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein two 
articles are loaded on said carriage at said article receiving 

section, and sorted from said carriage in opposite, respective 
directions at said article sorting section. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein a 
single article is loaded over at least two of said plurality of 

conveying means at said article receiving section. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein two 
articles are loaded on said carriage at said article receiving 

section, and sorted from said carriage to different, respective 
downstream conveying means at said article sorting section 

simultaneously. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein all of 
said plurality of conveying means are driven at said article 

sorting section. 
An article sorting system comprising: 
   a carriage movable along a track; 

   a plurality of conveying means which are provided on 
said carriage, and on which articles can be placed; and 

   control means for controlling and operating selected 
one or ones of said plurality of conveying means independently 

or cooperatively according to sorting destination data of said 
articles placed on said conveying means. 
The system according to claim 7, further 
comprising: 

   at least one article loading conveying means defining 
an article receiving section where an article can be loaded 

therefrom to said carriage; and 
   at least one article distributing conveying means 

defining an article sorting section where an article can be 
sorted from said carriage thereto. 
The system according to claim 7, wherein four 
conveying means in the form of belt conveyors are provided on 

said carriage.
