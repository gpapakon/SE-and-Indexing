<ABSTRACT>
The object of the disclosed system is the fast switching of high 
voltage and short duration pulses on loads which require high instantaneous 

intensities, in order to provide said pulses in both directions; the system 
is capable in switching narrow band signals, and therefore long duration 

signals. The system is based on a very low series impedance switching 
channel which is comprised of two high voltage capacitors (C1) in series 

with two rectifying groups (GR1 and GR2) connected in opposition and 
whose conduction status is activated by forced injection, through said 

groups, of a direct current controlled by a reactive network in series with 
a conventional low voltage unidirectional switch (CBT), thereby providing 

for its logical control (SL) from digital circuits TTL or CMOS. This system 
applies more particularly and immediately to wide band units which operate 

with high frequency radiations, particularly of ultrasonic type, and in fields 
such as diagnosis and non invasive medical treatment and non destructive 

tests of aeronautical and nuclear structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to
the field of
switching of wide band pulses and to switches
using semiconductor devices (H03B 11/10).The purpose of this system is electronic switching of
high voltage short duration monopolar pulses with very
short transition times, whose spectrum consequently
contains a great portion of high frequencies.The operability of the system, depending on the actual
realization and on the load impedances connected to its
terminals, can reach up to 900 V and 50 MHz.The analog switching channel permits the passing of
high voltage monopolar pulses in both directions and is
capable, until a certain voltage amplitude threshold, of
switching long duration bipolar signals, presenting in its
conducting state a notably low series impedance (in the
order of 1 Ohm).This system applies more particularly and immediately
to systems for controlling wide band equipments which
operate with high frequency radiations and need switching
of high voltage and medium power pulses (medical echography, 
non-destructive evaluation of materials) or of
pulses of high currents and high instantaneous powers
(ultrasonic lithotripsy, echographic inspection of strongly
attenuating industrial structures).The importance of a switching system with these
characteristics is based on that it offers good services
simultaneously in various aspects that are normally opposed
to each other in the bidirectional switching devices
presently available:
Maximum peak amplitude allowed in the switched
currents and voltages.Turn-on time and available bandwidth of the switching
channel.Series impedance in the conducting state.To this should be added the advantage that the control
of the system does not require the use of high voltage
sources.In analog switching applications, there has until now
been used methods based on the following devices: electromechanical
relays, bipolar transistors, thyristors, triacs
and, more recently, DMOS and VMOS transistors. Each of
these devices presents limitations in its functionability
when fast switching of high voltage pulses of high instantaneous
currents is required (for example with capacitive
loads) and under wide band conditions. 
The electromechanical relays offer an initially very
low series resistance in the connection state, but it
varies with the intensity of the current, an aspect
which degrades hastily with the use of the relays.
This makes these devices not very adequate for use in
the aforementioned applications, which generally
require the realization of several thousands of
switchings per
