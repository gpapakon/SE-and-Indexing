<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a binder for storing papers, comprising an attachment element in the inner spine of the binder and a loose attachment element (clip) for securing papers. The invention is characterized in that the attachment element (1) of the spine is provided with one or more open securing brackets (2-4) for receipt of a loose attachment element (5) consisting of a straight inner portion (6) to be clamped in the securing brackets (2-4), and two parallel outer legs (7, 8) bent at an angle of 90 DEG  at least 10 mm from the straight inner portion, where the outer legs are intended to pass through holes in the papers to be stored in this binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
BINDER FOR STORING PAPERSTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to a binder for storing papers, comprising an attachment element in the inner spine of the binder and a loose attachment element (clip) for securing the papers.The invention also relates to a modification of this device, but without permanent attachment elements.Background ArtA large number of constructions are already known having straight or curved attachment elements (clips), secured to a bottom plate in the sides or spine of the binder.Another known construction consists of straight outer parts of the attachment, bent directly from a straight bottom portion or secured to a bottom plate.A drawback common to these constructions is that, when the binder has been opened at a certain page in the papers stored, the pages below and above the one being perused must be held aside to allow the relevant page to be read or copied. An ordinary copier requires a the page to lie flat in contact with the glass plate of the copier, which generally means that the relevant paper must be removed from the stored stack.Another drawback is that, when several papers have been removed for copying, for instance, they must be replaced page by page since it is difficult to keep the holes in the individual pages exactly aligned.A further drawback is that the various constructions for storing papers are clumsy and difficult to manipulate.Summary of the InventionThe object of the invention is to solve these and other associated problems, and is characterised in that the attachment element of the spine is provided with one or more open securing brackets for receipt of a loose attachment element consisting of a straight inner portion to be clamped in the securing brackets, and two parallel outer legs bent at 

an angle of 60° - 120°, preferably approximately 90°, at least 10 mm from the straight inner portion, which outer legs are intended to pass through holes in the paper to be stored. When the binder is opened the papers below the one being perused fall down around the inner parts of the outer legs, nearest the inner portion. Since, therefore, the papers below fall down in this way they will not impede reading or copying of the relevant page. Similarly, neither will the pages above the relevant page, since they are gathered around the outer parts of the outer legs, outside the bend. It is thus a simple operation to copy one particular page stored in a construction according to the invention.DrawingsThe invention is exemplified in the accompanying drawings in

Claims:
1. A binder for storing papers, comprising an attachment element in the inner spine of the binder and a loose attachment element (clip) for securing papers, characterised in that the attachment element 1 of the spine is provided with one or more open securing brackets 2, 3, 4 for receipt of a loose attachment element 5 consisting of a straight inner portion 6 to be clamped in the securing brackets 2-4, and two parallel outer legs 7, 8 bent at an angle of 60° - 120°, preferably approximately 90°, at least 10 mm from the straight inner portion, which outer legs are intended to pass through holes in the paper to be stored in this binder, whereby when the binder is opened the papers below the one being perused fall down around the inner parts of the outer legs, whereas when the binder is closed all the papers are located around the outer parts of the outer legs.
2. A binder as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that bending is performed away from the spine (9, 10) of the binder.
3. A binder as claimed in claims 1-2, characterised in that bending is performed 10-75 mm from the straight inner portion 6.
4. A modification of the device claimed in the preceding claim, intended for binders or just stacks of papers without permanent attachment elements (1-4) for the straight inner portion of the loose attachment element (6), characterised in that the device for each binder or stack of papers (13) is provided with a suspension device (14) designed for insertion in the binder or stack of papers under the attachment element (5) and, together with the binderfetack of papers, to be suspended in a drawer, cabinet, trollevorthe like.
