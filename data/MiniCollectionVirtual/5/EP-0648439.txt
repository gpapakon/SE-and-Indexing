<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski-boot structure in which the front cover piece (4) of the upper (3) is intended to constitute the reference element ensuring all functions relating to control of flexing of the said upper (3) in cooperation with rigid extensions (2) of the lower shell part (1) and the closure device (8) of the upper (3) over the skier's lower leg in the practical, skiing position. The front cover piece (4) includes, on the one hand, stops (16) located opposite stops (11) obtained on the extensions (2), this being in the upper zone of the upper (3) and, on the other hand, in the lower part where it is extended by fastening tabs (15), an elastic element (22) mounted in a pre-stressed state in order to act in the front/rear direction. The closure device (8) connects the cover pieces (4) and (5) together on the interposed extensions (2), thus permitting flexing of the front cover piece (4) and thus of the upper (3) forwards against the resistance of the elastic element (22) without stressing the said extensions (2) and blocking the said upper (3) rearwards by means of the stops (16) of the cover piece (4) against those (11) of the extensions (2).

Ski boot whose shell base (1) is overlaid with an 
upper (3) having, on the one hand, a rear spoiler (5) and a 

front cuff (4) each journalled (9, 10) to the shell base (1), 
and on the other hand, vertical extensions (2) coming from the 

shell base (1), and which extend in correspondence with the 
sides of the ankle and the lower part of the skier's leg, the 

extensions (2) being equipped with abutments (11) adapted to 
limit the clearance of the front cuff, the latter being shaped 

like an incurved gutter corresponding with the front zone of 
the lower part of the leg and extending in its lower portion 

by two fastening and journal hooks (15) onto the shell base 
(1); the lower portion of the front cuff (4) being provided 

with an elastic element (22, 27) ensuring control of the 
flexion of the upper (3) in the rear-to-front direction, 

whereas the upper gutter-shaped portion, by means of a scallop 
(13), leaves free the shell base zone (1) extending above the 

instep, a tightening (8) and closure device of the upper (3) 
mutually connecting the front cuff (4) and rear spoiler (5) on 

the extensions (2) of the shell base (1), characterized in 
that the abutments (11) are obtained in the upper zone of the 

vertical extensions (2) substantially opposite the upper front 
zone of the front cuff (4) whose corresponding abutments (16) 

are constituted by the rear edges demarcating its wings (12), 
and in that the elastic element (22, 27) is mounted in a 

pre-stressed state causing the pivoting of the front cuff (4) 
in the front-to-rear direction as well as the mutual 

cooperation of the abutments (11, 16), and consequently 
maintains the front cuff (4) in blocking position in the 

front-to-rear direction and controlled flexion position in the 
rear-to-front direction.  

 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one of the abutments (11, 16) of the vertical 

extensions (2) of the shell base (1) and of the rear edges of 
the wings (12) of the front cuff (4) is adjustable in position 

on the element (2, 12) which bears it. 
Ski boot according to any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the vertical extensions (2) determine a 

"U"-shaped profile, seen in the direction transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the shell base (1), which is closed in 

the front zone by the front cuff (4) whose wings (12) 
partially cover these vertical extensions (2), and in the rear 

zone by the rear spoiler (5) whose wings (21) extend inside 
said extensions. 
Ski boot according to any of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that the elastic flexion control element (22) 

is constituted by an extension of the hooks (15) for fastening 
the front cuff (4) which extends beyond the journal axis (9) 

of said hooks (15) where it is then fixed (17) and immobilized 
on the shell base (1). 
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the elastic flexion control element (27) is constituted 

by a flexion bar which is attached to each of the hooks (15) 
for fastening the front cuff (14). 
Ski boot according to any of claims 1-5, 
characterized in that a device for limiting the clearance 

amplitude of the front cuff (4) in the rear-to-front direction 
is positioned in the upper zone of the vertical extensions (2) 

of the shell base (1), substantially opposite the upper front 
zone of the front cuff (4), and has on the one hand, at least  

 
one flexible link (31, 50) connected to said front cuff (4), 

and to at least one of the extensions (2) of the shell base 
(1) at the same level as the abutments (11, 16), and on the 

other hand, at least one tensioner (34, 51, 60) for adjusting 
the active length of the link (31, 50) adapted to release the 

latter between its fastening points (32, 54-55) in order to 
provide a certain clearance freedom to the 

front cuff (4) with respect to the extensions (2). 
Ski boot according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the clearance amplitude limitation device comprises a 

single flexible link (31) which extends, from the front cuff 
(4) where it is connected (32), along the vertical extensions 

(2) of the shell base (1) in the journal direction (10) of the 
rear spoiler (5) which it passes around to ascend along the 

dorsal zone of the latter and to be connected to a tensioner

Ski boot according to any of claims 6-8, 
characterized in that an elastic tensioning system comprising 

a spring (71) is associated with the tensioner (60) for 
adjusting the length of the link (31), and cooperates with the 

latter which it maintains in permanent tension state by
