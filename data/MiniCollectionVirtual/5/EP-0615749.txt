<ABSTRACT>
A method of alleviating pain such as neuropathic 
pain or acute inflammatory pain is provided which comprises 

administering to a mammal that is either exhibiting pain or 
is about to be subjected to a pain-causing event a pain 

alleviating/pain suppressing amount of at least one nontoxic 
antagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, e.g., 

dextrorphan, or metabolic precursor of such antagonist, 
e.g., dextromethorphan, or at least one nontoxic substance 

that blocks a major intracellular consequence of N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor activation, e.g., a phenothiazine such as 

trifluoperazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Serial 
No. 08/027,177, filed March 5, 1993. This invention relates to methods for the 
treatment of pain and, in particular, to the alleviation of 
chronic pain and its varieties, e.g., neuropathic pain, and 
acute persistent pain that is related to inflammation of 
injured body tissues. Chronic pain is persistent pain which has long 
outlasted the onset of any known or suspected physical 
cause. It can occur after a known injury or disease or it 
can occur without any known physical cause whatsoever. 
Moreover, it can be accompanied by known tissue pathology, 
such as chronic inflammation that occurs in some types of 
arthritis, or it can occur long after the healing of the 
injured tissue which is suspected or known to be the cause 
of chronic pain. Chronic pain is a very general concept and 
there are several varieties of chronic pain related to the 
musculoskeletal system, visceral organs, skin, and nervous 
system. Neuropathic pain can occur as a form of chronic 
pain and can also occur under acute conditions such as those 
following surgery or accidental trauma. Neuropathic pain 
can be defined as pain that results from an abnormal 
functioning of the peripheral and/or central nervous system. 
A critical component of this abnormal functioning is an  
 
exaggerated response of pain-related nerve cells either in 
the peripheral or in the central nervous system. This 
exaggerated responsiveness is manifested behaviorally as 
increased sensitivity to pain, i.e., as hyperalgesia or 
allodynia, both of which can occur in chronic neuropathic 
and acute inflammatory pains. An example is the pain from 
causalgia wherein even a light touch to the skin is felt as 
an excruciating burning pain (allodynia) or a normally mild 
pain is experienced as an excruciating one (hyperalgesia). Neuropathic pain is thought to be a consequence of 
damage to peripheral nerves or to regions of the central 
nervous system. However, abnormal functioning of pain-related 
regions of the nervous system can also occur with 
chronic inflammatory conditions such as certain types of 
arthritis and metabolic disorders such as diabetes as well 
as with acute inflammatory conditions. Thus, many types of 
chronic pains that are related to inflammation as well as 
acute pains that are related to inflammation can be 
considered to be at least partly neuropathic pains. The long term administration of narcotic 
analgesics to patients

<CLAIMS>

antagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor or 

a metabolic precursor of the antagonist in the manufacture 
of a medicament effective in alleviating pain in mammals. 
The use according to claim 1 wherein the pain is chronic 
pain.

substance which blocks a major intracellular 

consequence of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, 
said substance being selected from amphipathic long chain 

bases, quinolyloxazole-2-ones, 1,4-bis-(aminohydroxylalkylamino)-anthraquinones,

the pain is chronic neuropathic pain or acute inflammatory 

pain. 
The use according to claim 5 wherein the phenothiazine is 
trifluoperazine or pharmaceutically acceptable salts 

thereof and the naphthalene sulphonamide is 
N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulphonamide or
