<ABSTRACT>
A first signal processor stage (7) of an audio amplifier arrangement 
influences the signal strength of a received audio signal for at least part of the frequency 

range of the received audio signal. An output amplifier stage (11) amplifies the audio 
signal influenced by the first signal processor stage. The audio amplifier arrangement 

further includes a transformer (1) having a primary winding (2) connectable to a mains 
voltage and having a secondary winding (3) connected to an AC/DC converter (4) 

whose outputs are connected to at least the output amplifier stage (11) for feeding the 
output amplifier stage (11). A detection circuit (14) generates a detection signal (Vms) 

which is related to the power load of the transformer (1). An analysis circuit (15) 
detects in response to the detection signal whether the rise in temperature occurring in 

the transformer due to the power load has exceeded a specific norm. The analysis 
circuit (15) comprises a control circuit for reducing the signal strength of the received 

audio signal for at least said part of the frequency range in the case where a 
transgression of said norm is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an audio amplifier arrangement, having at least an
audio signal input for receiving an audio signal, a first signal processor stage for
influencing the signal strength of the received audio signal for at least part of the
frequency range of the received audio signal, an output amplifier stage for amplifying
an audio signal influenced by the first signal processor stage, a transformer having a
primary side connectable to a mains voltage and a secondary side connected to an
AC/DC converter outputs of which being connected to at least the output amplifier stage
for supplying a supply voltage to the output amplifier stage.Arrangements of this type are widely known. The magnitude of the output
power that can be supplied by the audio amplifier arrangement for a long period of time
is mainly determined by the loading capacity of the transformer used. For that matter,
with a given power load of the transformer, the temperature stabilizes at a value which
is lower as the loading capacity of the selected transformer is greater. To avoid the
temperature in the transformer rising above the maximum permissible temperature in
the event of a long-term high output power, generally a transformer is selected which is
sufficiently large to supply the desired power for a long period of time. The output
power of an audio amplifier arrangement, and thus the power load of the transformer,
strongly depends on a number of varying circumstances, such as: the dynamic in a
reproduced track, the impedance of the loudspeakers used and the set sound volume. In
extreme cases the circumstances may be such that the temperature of the transformer
rises to beyond the permissible limit, causing the transformer to break down.It is an object of the invention to provide an audio amplifier arrangement
which makes a higher power supply possible without this resulting in a breakdown of
the transformer.According to the invention this object is achieved by an audio amplifier
arrangement as defined in the opening paragraph, characterized in that the arrangement
comprises a detection circuit for generating a detection signal related to the power load
of the transformer, an analysis circuit for establishing, in response to the detection 
signal, whether the rise in temperature caused by the power load in the transformer has
exceeded a specific standard, the analysis circuit comprising control means for reducing
the signal strength of the received audio signal for at least said part of the frequency
range in the case where a
