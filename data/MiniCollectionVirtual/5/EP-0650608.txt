<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiation-sensitive mixture with: a) an at least swellable binder which is insoluble in water but soluble in an aqueous-alkaline solution; b) a compound which forms an acid under the effect of actinic radiation; and c) a compound containing at least one C-O-C or C-O-Si bond which can be dissociated by an acid; which also contains at least one compound with at least one nitrogen atom in an amine or amide bond in the proportion of 0.1 to 70 mol % in relation to the maximum quantity of acid which can theoretically be generated from compound b). The content of this compound with at lest one nitrogen atom in an amine or amide bond is preferably 0.5 to 50 and especially preferably 1 to 40 mol % in relation to the maximum quantity of acid which can be theoretically generated from compound b). The boiling point of the compound at normal pressure is over 100  C, preferably above 150 and especially preferably above 180  C. The mixture is particularly applicable to the production of electronic components. The invention also concerns a recording material with a substrate and a radiation-sensitive coating.

A radiation-sensitive mixture comprising

a) a binder which is insoluble in water but soluble
or at least swellable in aqueous alkaline solution,
b) a compound which forms an acid under the action
of actinic radiation and
c) a compound which contains at least one C-O-C or
C-O-Si bond which can be cleaved by an acid,

wherein said mixture additionally contains 0.1 to
70 mol %, based on the maximum amount of acid which

can theoretically be produced from the compound b),

more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the proportion of the

acid-forming compound or compounds b) is 0.01 to 7%
by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5% by weight, based in

each case on the total weight of the nonvolatile
components of the mixture.
The radiation-sensitive mixture as claimed in one or
more of claims 1 to 4, wherein the proportion of the

acid-cleavable compound or compounds is 1 to 50% by
weight, preferably 5 to 35% by weight, based in each

case on the total weight of the nonvolatile components
of the mixture.
