<ABSTRACT>
A padlock has a rotatable outer body part (24) which prevents the application of torque from a wrench to force the shackle (4) open. One or both ends of the padlock are also configured to prevent application of a wrench, the configuration being generally conical configuration (28) preferably at least at the shackle end (4) of the body of the padlock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to padlocks.Conventional padlocks are relatively easy to force open. Usually, all that
is necessary is to separately grip the body of the padlock and the bolt or shackle
of the padlock and to force the shackle open from the body. Even hardened
padlocks can be forced in this way by using a suitable wrench.According to the present invention there is provided a padlock comprising
a body and a shackle mounted on the body for movement between a closed,
locked, position and an open, released condition, wherein the body comprises an
inner body part which mounts the shackle and an associated locking mechanism,
and an outer body part mounted on the inner body part for rotation about the
longitudinal axis of the body, said outer body part having a length sufficient to
shield the inner body part against the application of a torque acting about the
longitudinal axis of the inner body part to force the padlock, and the body having
at least at one end portion a formation which progressively reduces in cross-sectional
dimension whereby to impede the application of a wrench to the body
should the jaws of a wrench be applied to the opposite ends of the body.In a preferred embodiment, the said formation is a generally conical
formation on the inner body part at the shackle end of the body. Alternatively
or in addition the said conical formation may be at the end of the inner body part
remote from the shackle end.Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a padlock in accordance with the
preferred embodiment of the invention;Figure 2 is a longitudinal section through the padlock to show
schematically the operating components, a rotatable outer body part being
omitted for the sake of clarity;Figure 3 is a longitudinal section showing the mounting of the outer body
part on the inner body part; andFigures 4 to 6 are perspective views showing further embodiments of the
invention.The padlock shown in Figures 1 to 3 of the accompanying drawings
comprises a body 2 and a curved bolt or shackle 4. The body 2 consists of an
inner body part 6 of a substantially cylindrical shape. The inner body part has
diametrically-opposed longitudinally extending bores 8,10 which receive opposed
arms 12, 14 of the shackle 4. The arm 12 of the shackle is longer than the arm
14 and is displaceable in the bore 8 between an inner locked position in which the
shorter arm 14 is within the bore 10, and

<CLAIMS>
A padlock comprising a body (2) and a shackle (4) mounted on the body for
movement between a closed, locked, position and an open, released condition,

wherein the body comprises an inner body part (6) which mounts the shackle and an
associated locking mechanism, and an outer body part (24) mounted on the inner body (6)

part for rotation about the longitudinal axis of the body, said outer body part
having a length sufficient to shield the inner body part against the application of

a torque acting about the longitudinal axis of the inner body part to force the
padlock, and the body (2) having at least at one end portion a formation (28,36) which

progressively reduces in cross-sectional dimension whereby to impede the
application of a wrench to the body should the jaws of a wrench be applied

to the opposite ends of the body.
A padlock according to claim 1, wherein the said formation is a generally

conical formation (28) on the inner body part at the shackle end of the body.
A padlock according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the said formation is
a generally conical formation (36) at the end of the inner body part remote from the

shackle end.
A padlock according to claim 3, wherein the conical formation is cut away
at one side (32) to permit the shackle to swing between an open and closed position.
A padlock according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the outer body
part (24) is of annular section and surrounds the inner body part (6) over a substantial

portion of the length of the inner body part.
