<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display apparatus according
to the preamble of claim 1 and a multi-eye image displaying
method according to the preamble of claim 12. The apparatus and
method is usable for magnifying image data of a small-sized
displaying element such as, e.g., a liquid crystal
display element, a CRT, etc., imaging and displaying the
image data as virtual images in front of a viewer.A conventional displaying apparatus provides the
image data in the form of photos, a TV and a movie or the
like. Along development of the scientific technology, the
displaying apparatus has hitherto been constructed to give
a wider view angle and a higher performance of a fine
display. For instance, a high-vision (high-definition) TV
has a specification to increase more number of scanning
lines than a conventional color TV and to provide an image
full of presence with a scale-up of a picture size.There arise, however, the following problems inherent
in the conventional art displaying apparatus. The attempt
of enhancing the performance leads to an increase in size.
This in turn worsens its portability and generality in
terms of purpose as well, and it follows that the costs
increase. Further, reversely when pursuing portability
above all, the picture size becomes inevitably reduced.
The image exhibiting the wider view angle can not be 
therefore provided.Additionally, if a device corresponding to NTSC and a
HD signal is used for an imaging device and a variety of
panel displays, an aspect ratio is fixed. This conduces
to a problem of decreasing a degree of freedom to obtain
an aspect ratio desired by the viewer. A generic display apparatus and a generic multi-eye image
displaying method are known from EP-A-0 344 881. An image
displaying means is provided for the right and the left eye. A
display unit displays an image. An optical system projects the
beams from the display unit toward a pupil of a viewer and, as
a result, forms a virtual image of the image on the display
unit in front of the pupil. The user of the display apparatus
can manipulate the display apparatus by means of an extension
joint and hinge joints in order to adjust the positional
relationship between the right and left virtual images. Thus,
an adaptation of the complete display apparatus to the specific
shape of the head of the user is possible such that the virtual
images are precisely positioned in front of the viewer's
pupils.It is an object of the present invention to further develop a
display apparatus according to the preamble of
