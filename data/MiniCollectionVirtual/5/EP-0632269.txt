<ABSTRACT>
Device for capturing a target molecule for the purpose of detecting it and/or quantitatively determining it, comprising a solid support on which a ligand is immobilized, the said ligand being in the form of a conjugate resulting from the covalent coupling of a polymer with a plurality of molecules of the said ligand. The polymer is a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone and the conjugate is immobilized on the solid support by adsorption. When the ligand is capable of forming a complex with the target, the device is specific for a given target. When the device furthermore comprises a bifunctional reactant capable of forming a complex on the one hand with the ligand and on the other hand with the target, the support on which the ligand is immobilized constitutes a universal capture system.

<CLAIMS>
Device for capturing a target molecule for the
purpose of detecting it and/or assaying it, by bringing

the said device into contact with a liquid vehicle
containing the said target molecule in solution, the said

device comprising a solid support on which is immobilized
a ligand capable of forming a complex of ligand/antiligand

type, the said ligand being present in the form of
a conjugate resulting from the covalent coupling of a

polymer with a plurality of molecules of the said ligand,
characterized by the fact that the said polymer is an N-vinylpyrrolidone

copolymer, and that the said conjugate,
which is soluble in the said liquid vehicle, is

immobilized on the solid support by adsorption.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the copolymer results from the copolymerization

of an N-vinylpyrrolidone monomer and a second monomer
permitting the establishment of a covalent coupling

between the ligand and the copolymer.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized by the
fact that the second monomer carries a reactive functional

group or an activable functional group permitting
the formation of a covalent bond between the copolymer

and the ligand, the said reactive functional group being
chosen from aldehyde, epoxy, haloalkyl, primary amine,

thiol, maleimide and ester functional groups, in particular
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, and the said activable

functional group being chosen from carboxyl and hydroxyl
functional groups.
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
by the fact that the second monomer is N-acryloxysuccinimide. 
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by the fact that the said copolymer

contains from 25 to 70 %, in units, of N-vinylpyrrolidone
units.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by the fact that the said anti-ligand

constitutes the target molecule.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized by the
fact that the said complex is chosen from the

antigen/antibody, antibody/hapten, hormone/receptor or
chelator/chelated molecule complexes and the polynucleotide/polynucleotide

or polynucleotide/nucleic acid
hybrids.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by the fact that it comprises, in

addition, a bifunctional reagent comprising an anti-ligand
group, permitting the formation of a complex with

the ligand, the said anti-ligand group being bonded with
a partner group for the target, capable of forming a

partner/target complex.
Device according to Claim 8, characterized by the
fact that the anti-ligand group is capable of forming,

with the ligand, a complex, the said complex being chosen
from the antigen/antibody, antibody/hapten, hormone/

receptor, polynucleotide/polynucleotide hybrid,
polynucleotide/nucleic acid hybrid, chelator/chelated

molecule, biotin/streptadivin and lectin/sugar complexes.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized by the fact that the said ligand is a

polynucleotide containing 5 to 100 nucleotides.
Process for capturing target molecules, in which
a solution of the target molecule is brought into contact

with a device comprising a solid support on which is
immobilized a ligand, under conditions permitting the

formation of a ligand/anti-ligand type complex, characterized
by the fact that the said device is as defined in

any one of the preceding claims.
