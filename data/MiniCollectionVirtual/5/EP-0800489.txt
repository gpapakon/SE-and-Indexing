<ABSTRACT>
A vaporizer (film evaporator) (13) for halide-free, silicon-containing liquid reactants used in producing preforms is provided. The vaporizer includes a plurality of packed-bed columns (22) surrounding a central tube (24). A mixture of liquid reactant, e.g., octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, and gas, e.g., oxygen, is sprayed onto the top surfaces (54) of the columns (22) by a set of spray nozzles (32). The liquid reactant and the gas flow downward together through the columns and are heated by hot oil (28) which flows around the columns' walls (50). The liquid reactant evaporates into the gas until the dew point temperature is reached, at which point all of the liquid reactant will have been converted into vapor. The vapor/gas mixture exits the bottom surfaces (56) of columns (22), where its direction of flow changes from downward to upward. This change in flow direction separates higher molecular weight species (46) from the vapor/gas mixture. The vapor/gas mixture leaves the vaporizer (13) through the central tube (24) and is supplied to soot-producing burners (20) where it is used to produce preforms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vaporizers (evaporators)
for use in producing preforms which can be used to produce
optical or acoustic waveguide fibers either directly or
through intermediate production of core cane.Historically, halide-containing raw materials, such
as, SiCl4 or mixtures of SiCl4 with various dopants, have
been used in the manufacture of preforms by vapor phase
deposition techniques, such as, the MCVD (modified
chemical vapor deposition), VAD (vapor axial deposition),
and OVD (outside vapor deposition) techniques.In the MCVD technique, the halide-containing raw
materials are vaporized and reacted with oxygen to form
oxide particles which are deposited on the inside of a
fused-silica tube. In the VAD and OVD procedures,
vaporized, halide-containing raw materials are hydrolyzed
in a burner to produce soot particles which are collected
on a rotating starting rod (bait tube) in the case of VAD
or a rotating mandrel in the case of OVD. In some OVD
systems, the cladding portion of the preform is deposited
on a previously-formed core preform, rather than on a
mandrel. Various vaporizers have been developed which can be used
in such processes, examples of which can be found in

4,529,427 (flash vaporizer), Tsuchiya et al, U.S. Patent No
4,938,789, Antos et al, U.S. Patent No 5,078,092 (halide-free
reactants), and Japanese Patent Publication No 58-125633 (flash
vaporizer) . Soubeyrand et al, U.S. Patent No 5,090,985,
discloses the use of a horizontal thin film evaporator for
vaporizing various raw materials employed in the preparation
of coated glass articles.Aslami, U.S. Patent No 4,212,663, discloses a vertically
oriented packed-bed column with a top liquid feed and a bottom
gas feed. The column is provided with a vaporization system
for a liquid reactant, e.g. SiCl4, in which a heated reactant
is deposited on the top of the column containing a porous
packing material and carrier gas, e.g., oxygen, is bubbled
through a reservoir of the liquid reactant and then up through
the column. The Aslami system can include a second, heated
column located above the first column which serves to: (1)
ensure that the carrier gas is fully saturated, and (2) prevent
droplets of the liquid reactant from being entrained in the
flowing gas. Significantly, with regard to the present
invention, Aslami's reactant and carrier gas do not flow
downward together to achieve vaporization and then change
direction together to separate out undesirable higher
