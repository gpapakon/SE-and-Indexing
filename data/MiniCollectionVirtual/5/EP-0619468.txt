<ABSTRACT>
A multi-pass evaporator (10) of a heat 
exchanger for a motor vehicle air-conditioning system 

includes a plurality of heat exchanger tubes (12a-t) 
coupled to first and second header tubes (30,32) 

disposed side by side. The first header tube contains 
a blocking member (52) and an inlet tube (48) 

extending from an inlet end (38) of the first header 
tube (30) to the blocking member (52). The blocking 

member (52) includes an aperture (53) which receives 
the bell-shaped end (54) of the inlet tube (48). A 

plurality of tangs (72a-c) are provided on the 
blocking member (52) which are deformable onto the 

open end (54) of the inlet tube (48) so as to secure 
the inlet tube (48) to the blocking member (52). The 

inlet tube (48) is then brazed to the tangs (72a-c). 
This design of the end of the inlet tube has been 

found to reduce considerably noise produced during use 
of the evaporator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
evaporator of a heat exchanger for use, for example in 
a motor vehicle air-conditioning system. An example of system containing a 
refrigerant evaporator of the U-flow type of tube and 
fin construction is shown in EP-A-0138435. Typically, such refrigerant evaporators 
utilise a number of U-shaped tubes which are 
interconnected at the ends thereof by two adjacent 
header tubes so as to form a bank of interconnected 
U-shaped tubes in which refrigerant fluid supplied to 
one of the header tubes can pass in parallel flow 
through the U-shaped tubes into the other header tube. 
Such a bank of U-shaped tubes is substantially 
rectangular in shape and typically has been housed in 
a substantially rectangular box-like housing within 
the motor vehicle air-conditioning system. These 
U-flow refrigerant evaporators display good 
refrigerant fluid pressure drop characteristics when 
in operation. It is customary in such refrigerant 
evaporators to sub-divide the two adjacent header 
tubes into separate multi-pass manifolds which 
interconnect the ends of the U-shaped tubes so that 
the refrigerant fluid is caused to flow in several 
passes, each containing several U-shaped tubes, 
backwards and forwards across the evaporator from one 
header tube to the other header tube. In such 
refrigerant evaporators, it is customary to have an 
inlet for the refrigerant fluid entering one end of 
one of the header tubes and an outlet for the 
refrigerant fluid exiting from the other end of that 
header tube or the adjacent end of the adjacent header 
tube, depending on how many passes are provided in the 
evaporator. Thus, in the customary three-pass U-flow  
 
refrigerant evaporator, the inlet for the refrigerant 
fluid is at one end of one of the header tubes and the 
outlet is at the other end of the other header tube. Problems are now arising in the design of 
modern motor vehicles wherein the quantity of 
auxiliary equipment being provided in the motor 
vehicle is conflicting with the space available in the 
motor vehicle to house such equipment. Consequently, 
the volume of space available to house 
air-conditioning systems in many modern motor vehicles 
is so confined that, in many instances, there is 
insufficient room for a rectangular-shaped refrigerant 
evaporator of the type which has a refrigerant fluid 
inlet positioned at one end of the evaporator and a 
refrigerant fluid outlet positioned at the other end 
of the evaporator. An arrangement has been devised for the 
custo
