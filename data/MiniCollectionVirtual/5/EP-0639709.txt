<ABSTRACT>
Problems posed by liquid or gas fuels 
combustion pollution, requires that at any 

instant a better primary air-fuel mixture is 
needed. A non adequated excess-air factor 

will be the source for an incomplete 
combustion with formation of pollutants. In 

order to solve these problems a fluid mixture 
control valve that can be used as part of a 

carburettor as been invented. 
The mixture valve invented, it is a mixture 
control valve controlling mixture of a fluid α 

on a second fluid β, and, it is composed by a 
set of two calibrated orifices [4]
 and [5], on a 

cilindrical tube [2], obturated by the rotative 

cilindrical pistons [1] and [3]
. The fluid α 
flow (liquid ou gas) injected, will be 

dependent of angular position of the two 
pistons [1]
 and [3], and so, it will be a 

function of two independent control 
parameters. 
As an application, it is also, patented, a 
carburettor for internal combustion engines, 

using the mixture valve [6] on primary-air 

flow condut (fluid β), controlling the fuel 
flow (fluid α). Mixture valve it is actuated by 

two cams [7] and [8]
, controlled respectively 
by butterfly valve [11]
 and by air-flow sensor 
[7]
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mixture control 
valve controlling a fluid α flow (liquid or 
gas), in order to mix it with a second fluid β 
(liquid or gas), with or without state 
transition of any of the fluids. The control 
valve acts as a mixture control of fluid α 
flow with fluid β flow. An application, it is 
on controlling the primary air-fuel mixture, 
in combustion systems and/or in carburation 
systems on internal combustion engines, 
acting as a carburettor. The mixture valve represented in exploded 
perspective in figure 1, and, sectionned in 
figure 2, it is constituted by a set of two 
calibrated orifices [4] and [5], on a cilindrical 
tube [2], the orifices are obturated by two 
rotative cilindrical pistons [1] and [3]. The 
pistons have a rotative displacement inside 
tube [2] and the profile cutted together with 
their displacement defines the pressure drop 
coefficient of each one of the sets rotative 
piston-orifice. So total pressure drop 
coefficient will be a function of angular 
position of the two pistons [1] and [3]. And 
the mixture control will be a function of 
those two independent parameters. If cilinder [2] is placed on fluid β flow 
(liquid or gas), where we intend to control  
 
mixture with a second fluid α (liquid or gas) 
flow, it will be injected by mixture valve. 
Fluid α will be introduced at constant 
pressure, by an adequated tube on orifice [4], 
and comming out to mixture with fluid β 
(liquid or gas) on orifice [5]. The fluid α 
(liquid or gas) flow injected, will be a 
function of the angular position of the two 
pistons [1] and [3], and, will be a function of 
two independent parameters. So actuation on 
pistons will be mechanical, automated, 
motorized, and so on. A typical application for the mixture valve 
corresponds to it's use on controlling the 
primary air-fuel mixture, in combustion 
systems and/or in carburation systems acting 
as a carburettor. So the fuel α flow will be 
controled on mixture with primary air β flow 
(see figures 3 and 4) in order to obtain a 
mixture α+β almost ideal in transients 
(during acceleration or desacceleration of 
internal combustion engines). One of the 
pistons will be actuated by engine accelerator 
[12], simulthaneously with butterfly valve 
[11], and the second piston will be actuated 
by sensor plate [7] measuring primary air 
flow, so we have a carburettor, that will 
provide at any instant an ideal primary 
air-fuel almost ideal (excess-air factor 
λ∼constant). So a better specific 
consumation so as less carbon

Mixture control valve controlling the 
mixture of two fluids, function of two 

independent control parameters. This is a 
mixture valve controlling the fluid α flow 

in a second fluid β flow, it is composed 
by a set of two calibrated orifices [4]
 and 
[5]
, on a cillindrical tube [2], obturated by 

two cillindrical rotative pistons [1] and 

[3]. The fluid α flow (liquid ou gas) 

injected, will be dependent from angular 
position of the rotative pistons [1]
 and [3], 

so it will be a function of two independent 
control parameters.. 

Control parameters will be the angular 
displacement of the cilindical pistons. 
Internal combustion engine carburettor, 
based on an application of the mixture 

control valve [10] in claim 1. Mechanical 

control, based on two cams [9] and [6]
 
will provide a primary air-fuel factor 

almost ideal, in transients (acceleration--desacceleration), 
cam [9]
 will be 
actuated simulaneously with butterfly 

valve [11] and cam [6]
 will be actuated by 
the air flow sensor [7]
