<ABSTRACT>
Improved oven which incorporates a heated chamber and an auxiliary compartment housing heating means and means for pulsing hot fluid towards the heated chamber via the inside of a fixed duct. Located inside the heated chamber is at least one hollow gantry acted upon by a driving element which forces it to move to and fro on guide means; in its internal flanks this hollow gantry defines a small number of vertically equidistant outlets, and the end of the hot-air circulation duct fits in a sliding manner into the outer flank. Means for driving tray-carrying trolleys may be located inside the oven in order to position these trolleys inside the gantry. This oven applies to the cooking of products, preferably food products.
