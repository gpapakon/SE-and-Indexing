<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10,10') includes a 
dielectric housing (12,70) having a terminal-receiving 

passageway (22,72). An insulation displacement terminal 
(16,16') is received in the passageway for terminating an 

insulated wire (52) extending into the passageway. The 
wire includes an electrical conductor (52b) with a sheath 

of insulation (52a) thereabout. The terminal includes a 
terminating section (32) deflectable for displacing the 

insulation and engaging the conductor. The terminating 
section is generally flat in a plane coincident with the 

longitudinal axis (54) of the insulated wire. At least a 
portion (44) of the terminating section (32) is deflectable 

upon the application of a force on the terminal generally 
parallel to the longitudinal axis. The terminating section 

is configured (46,50) to be permanently deformed when 
deflected into insulation-displacing condition with the 

insulated wire (52). The invention also is directed to 
such a terminal (16,16'), per se.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to an insulation
displacement terminal according to the preamble of claim 7.Electrical connectors have become widely accepted
as a preferred means for interconnecting the circuitry
components of electrically operated products and equipment.
In such applications, providing for easy connection and
disconnection of cable or wire through the use of
connectors permits convenience of assembly and maintenance
as well as versatility in design.Connectors in current use are of diverse
construction. However, a common arrangement includes a
dielectric housing fitted with a plurality of stamped and
formed conductive terminals to which insulated
multiconductor cable or wiring may be electrically
connected. Numerous terminal configurations likewise are
available, suited to the specific requirement of the
application. A preferred terminal in many applications is
one which has the capability of establishing electrical
contact with the conductors of the cable by displacement of
the insulative coating of the conductors, obviating the
need to perform the separate step of stripping the
insulative coating.A wide variety of insulation displacement
terminals are known in the art. Generally, these terminals 
provide a narrow slot which receives an insulation covered
wire, severs the insulation covering of the wire in the
process, and establishes, automatically, an electrical
connection between the terminal and the central core of the
wire. This is contrasted with the self-piercing type of
terminals which usually have sections in the form of teeth
that pierce the insulation and engage the metallic core
when the terminal is clinched or secured to the wire. When
piercing the insulation, the teeth, in essence, also
displace the insulation in order to engage the core of the
wire.One type of self-piercing terminal is a flat,
stamped metal terminal commonly used to terminate
electrical wires on a low pitch spacing, such as in a
Western Electric Company modular phone plug, as is shown in
U.S. Patent No. 3,954,320, dated May 4, 1976. Such
terminals have been used primarily with electrical wires
having stranded conductive cores. The terminals require
terminating forces applied normal to the longitudinal axis
of the insulated wire, and the connector relies on the
dielectric or plastic housing to maintain contact pressure
on the terminals after termination. Such flat terminal
connectors cause problems in many applications because the

An electrical connector (10, 10') which includes a
dielectric housing (12, 70) having a terminal-receiving

passageway (22, 72), an insulation displacement terminal
