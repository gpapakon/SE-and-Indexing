<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for evaluating the shape of a three-dimensional 
object, comprises means for setting an ideal 

surface of the three-dimensional object within a given 
space based on reference data, means for setting a worked 

surface of the three-dimensional object corresponding to 
the ideal surface within said space as a set of space 

coordinates obtained from measurements at a plurality of 
measurement points, intersection point calculating means 

for determining space coordinates at a point at which a 
line extending from each of the measurement points perpendicularly 

intersects the ideal surface, and distance 
calculating means for determining the distance between 

the intersection point and the measurement point based on 
the space coordinates of intersection and measurement 

points, whereby the distance determined by said distance 
calculating means can be used to evaluate the precision 

of the worked surface. Measurement data of the work surface 

previously measured is compared with the ideal 
surface based on reference data such as CAD shape data or 

the like to determine a distance from each of the measurement 
points to the ideal surface in the perpendicular 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method
for evaluating the shape of a three-dimensional object,
and particularly, to such an apparatus and method that
evaluate the precision at a worked surface of a three-dimensional
object by comparing the worked surface of the
three-dimensional object actually measured in the form of
space coordinates at a plurality of measurement points
with an ideal surface of the three-dimensional object
which has been stored in the form of three-dimensional
curved surface data.There is known a three coordinate measuring machine which
measures the shape of a surface, which includes a curved
surface, of a three-dimensional object. Such a three-coordinate
measuring machine determines space coordinates
at a plurality of measurement points by contacting a
probe on the surface of the object and grasps the surface
of the object based on a set of space coordinates.
The three coordinate measuring machine is utilized in
evaluating the precision of the three-dimensional shape
of a workpiece. The surface of the workpiece measured by 
the three coordinate measuring machine is compared with
an ideal surface of the workpiece defined by CAD shape
data or design drawing data. The difference between the
measured and the ideal surfaces determines the precision
of the surface of the workpiece. When the workpiece is to
be finished while utilizing the measurement of the three
coordinate measuring machine, the amount of material cut
off from the workpiece, that is, the distance from the
measured surface of the workpiece to the ideal surface of
the same (distance perpendicular to the ideal surface)
must be determined.For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 1-26817
discloses a system for determining such a perpendicular
distance. Such a system first determines a reference
point of a space coordinate on the ideal surface defined
by the CAD shape data and also a perpendicular vector at
the reference point. By using the perpendicular vector,
the actual space coordinates of the worked surface of the
three-dimensional object are then measured through the
three coordinate measuring machine in the direction
perpendicular to the ideal surface. The distance between
the measured space coordinates and the reference point is
determined by the perpendicular vector. In this manner,
the perpendicular distance from the measured worked
surface to the ideal surface based on the CAD shape data
can be determined. In this example, the above results are
utilized to display the surface of the workpiece
