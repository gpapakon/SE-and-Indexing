<ABSTRACT>
In a lock, a lock body (16) has a locking-spindle receptacle (46), into which the locking spindle (14) can be inserted and then locked. For locking the locking spindle, a locking ball (24) engages into a locking surface (26) of the locking spindle (14). The locking ball (24) is held in the locking position by an adjusting element (28), the adjusting element (28) being controlled by a locking device (34). When the blocking device is not blocked, the adjusting element and therefore also the locking ball (24) can shift transversely relative to the locking spindle (14), so that the locking spindle can be pulled easily. In contrast, if the blocking device is blocked, a shift of the locking ball (24) is prevented. The locking ball can then be displaced by the locking spindle (14) in the pull-out direction counter to the elastic resistance of its guide track and comes into self-locking clamping engagement between the locking surface (26) of the locking spindle (14) and an abutment. Reaction forces as the result of high pull-out forces are thereby kept away from the lock furniture. The abutment (50) can be secured on the locking spindle itself.

A lock, comprising a lock body (16) with at least one
locking pin receptacle (46) and a locking pin (14),

which may be inserted in a locking pin insertion
direction (38) into a locking pin locking position

inside the locking pin receptacle (46) and secured
therein and which may be withdrawn from the locking pin

receptacle (46) in a locking pin withdrawal direction
(38), which is the opposite of the locking pin insertion

direction (38), a bolt element (24), which is provided
to secure the locking pin (14) in its locking position

inside the lock body (16), being adjustable between a
release position and a securing position along a guide

path (22) extending substantially orthogonally to the
locking pin insertion direction (38) and engaging, in

the securing position, with a locking face (26) of the
locking pin (14) and a control element (28) being

provided for the purpose of controlling the bolt element
(24) and being adjustable along the guide path (22)

between a retracted position corresponding to the
release position and an arresting position corresponding

to the securing position, by means of which control
element (28) the bolt element (24) may be selectively

set to a "securing state", i.e. a state in which it
remains in the securing position preventing pin

withdrawal, or to a "release state", i.e. a state in
which, when a spring force-countering withdrawal force

(P) is applied to the locking pin (14), the bolt element
(24) may move from its securing position towards its

release position along the guide path through cam-type
interaction with the locking pin (14) and thus enable

withdrawal of the locking pin (14), characterised in 
that the bolt element (24) is uncoupled mechanically

from the control element (28) in the locking pin
withdrawal direction (38) at least within the confines

of the available motional play and in that, beyond the
guide path (22), the bolt element (24) is associated

with an abutment (50b) on the lock body (16), wherein,
when the pin withdrawal force (P) increases, the bolt

element (24), if in the securing state, becomes
additionally jammed in a self-retaining manner between

the locking face (26) of the locking pin (14) and the
abutment (50b) on the lock body (16).
A lock according to claim 1, characterised in that the

abutment element (48), which at least partially

encompasses the locking pin (14) in its locking pin
locking position and is supported thereon against a

transverse force oriented substantially perpendicularly
to the locking pin withdrawal direction (38), which

transverse force arises as a consequence of the jamming
of the bolt element (24) between locking face (26) and

abutment (50b) when a withdrawal force (P) acts on the
locking pin (14).

abutment element (48) is mounted inside the lock body

(16) with motional play perpendicular to the locking pin
withdrawal direction (38).

into the securing position by the control element (28)

under spring force (32) and in that the locking pin (14)
may be withdrawn from the locking pin locking position

through cam-type interaction with the bolt element (24),
wherein the bolt element (24) moves towards the release

position.
