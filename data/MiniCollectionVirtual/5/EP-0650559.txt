<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a scotching or supporting wedge (1) for filling in a space between two constructional parts, in which each wedge face is provided with transverse and transversally-oriented teeth (2, 5) having predominantly a serrated profile, the serrations of which point towards the thickest end (4) of the wedge, and in which each wedge face is provided throughout its length with guide mechanisms, a defective interlock has been established between two wedge faces in those areas of the faces at which the serrated teeth are prevented from engaging, the result being distorted scotching of the relevant constructional parts during erection. With a view to combatting such drawbacks it is proposed that the guide mechanisms be comprised of at least one slot (3) having a rectangular transverse profile, a depth smaller than or equal to 1/2A, where A is the height of the transverse serrated teeth (2, 5), and a width of X.A, where X

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a scotching or supporting wedge for filling in a 
space between two constructional parts, as for example in scotching of building 
components, installation of thermal windows, or placement between floorboards 
and underlying joists as support for parquet flooring, in which such scotching 
is commonly effected using two wedges, the faces of which are provided with 
transverse and transversally-oriented teeth having a serrated profile with 
serrations pointing towards the thickest end of the wedge, and in which each 
wedge face is provided throughout its length with guide mechanisms so that in 
the scotched position the two wedge faces are securely locked together by 
means of the transverse teeth and the guide mechanisms. Such scotching wedges are known for example from GB-A-2106609, where 
a wedge with transverse ridges and a slot providing a guide means is disclosed. 
The transverse ridges of mainly sinusodial profile cannot perform the 
functions of locking the wedges from a sliding towards the thin end, and when 
sliding on each other, the wedges do not slide on all the surface of each other, 
but only on part of it. This is evident, as the ridges are not serrated. The risk is 
that the wedges are riding on each other on the top of the ridges, thereby being 
unstable or causing wear when used. A kind of "interlocking" between the 
wedge faces can only occur in very coarse steps, namely the "wavelength" of 
the sinusodial profile. Saw-tooth widges are also mentioned. The slot providing a guide means has a V-shaped cross section and is 
therefore dependent on a complementary formation on a mating wedge. This 
dependency is very strict, as two identical wedges with identical guide means 
will never perform the designed function. The V-shaped cross section will not 
be dependent on the butting of the ridges, as all side control is taken over by 
the V-shaped guide means. Also, Danish patent application no. 861/72, and Danish Patent 
specifications no. 141414 and 144280 are known. Danish patent application no. 
861/72 relates to a supporting wedge made of plastic, with wedge faces 
constructed as alternate projections and recesses in order to save on material 
and increase lightness and sound insulation when installed. Danish Patent 
specification no. 141414 relates to a wedge which is similar, but which by 
slightly offsetting the centre row of blocks of serrated teeth, prevents 
transverse displacement of the complemental wedge during scotching. Finally, 
Danish Patent

<CLAIMS>
A scotching or supporting wedge (1) for filling in a space between two 
constructional parts, in which each wedge face is provided with transverse and 

transversally-oriented teeth (2, 5) having a serrated profile, the serrations of 
which point to
wards the thickest end (4) of the wedge, and in which each wedge 
face is provided throughout its length with a guide mechanism, 

the guide mechanism being comprised of at least one slot in the 
transverse serrated teeth (2, 5) and having a rectangular transverse profile, 
characterised in that
 
the slot is formed above a rail, the top surface of the rail forming the bottom of the slot and being elevated above the bottoms of the serrations, and the distance from the elevated bottom (3) of the slot to the peak of the 

serrated teeth is smaller than or equal to Â½A, where A is the height of the 
transverse serrated teeth (2, 5), so that 

the upper sections of the opposing 
vertical end faces of each serration (2, 5) can make contact with the similarly 

vertical, side faces of the corresponding external sides of the rail 
in a complemental wedge face.
