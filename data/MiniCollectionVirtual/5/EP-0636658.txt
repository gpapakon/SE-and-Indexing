<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
resin composition. More particularly, it relates 
to a thermoplastic resin composition which comprises a 
crystalline thermoplastic resin composition, a polyphenylene 
ether resin and a specific ethylene-α-olefin 
copolymer resin and which is excellent in stiffness and 
impact strength. Crystalline thermoplastic resins represented by 
polyamides, polyesters and polyphenylene sulfides are 
superior in mechanical properties, oil resistance and 
flowability, but have the defects such as large distortion 
at the time of molding and insufficient heat resistance. 
As an approach to improve these defects of crystalline 
thermoplastic resins, blends of crystalline thermoplastic 
resins with non-crystalline resins have been proposed. 
As the non-crystalline thermoplastic resins having high 
heat resistance, polyphenylene ether resins have been 
widely used. That is, many proposals have been made for 
blends of crystalline thermoplastic resins with polyphenylene 
ether resins. For example, Japanese Patent Kokai 
No. 56-1655 discloses a resin composition comprising a 
polyphenylene ether and a polyamide, Japanese Patent Kokoku 
No. 56-34032 discloses a resin composition comprising a 
polyphenylene ether and a polyphenylene sulfide, Japanese 
Patent Kokai No. 49-50050 discloses a resin composition 
comprising a polyphenylene ether and a polyester, and 
Japanese Patent Kokai No. 63-183954 discloses a resin 
composition comprising a crystalline thermoplastic resin 
and a polyphenylene ether and having a specific 
morphology. However, these conventional resin compositions 
are insufficient in impact resistance. For improving the  
 
impact resistance, EP 236596 and Japanese Patent Kokai 
No. 60-44547 propose to add elastomers to the compositions. 
However, these have the problem that stiffness of the 
resulting compositions decreases. The object of the present invention is to 
provide thermoplastic resin compositions which are 
improved in impact resistance with maintaining the 
features of the resin compositions comprising crystalline 
thermoplastic resins and polyphenylene ether resins, 
namely, small distortion at the time of molding and 
excellent oil resistance, heat resistance and stiffness. The inventors have conducted intensive research 
on thermoplastic resin compositions comprising a 
crystalline thermoplastic resin and a polyphenylene ether 
resin as main resin components and have found that the 
above problems can be solved in whole or in part by adding a 
s
