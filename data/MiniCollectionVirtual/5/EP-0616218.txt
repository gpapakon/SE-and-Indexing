<ABSTRACT>
A minute sample analysis system which comprises 
a micro-reactor device (1), a quantitative measuring 

device (2), a analyzing device (3) and a controller (4), 
whereby, when a very small amount of sample is handled, 

its dilution and loss can be suppressed to minimum level 
and analyzing operations ranging from reaction with 

reactive reagent to separation/detection of the sample 
can be consistently carried out efficiently. The micro- 

reactor device (1) controls the solution, reactive 
reagent and sample flowing in the form of electroosmotic 

flow generated by high-voltage application under control 
of passage change-over switches; while the quantitative 

measuring device (2) measures the quantity of reactive 
sample received from the micro-reactor device (1) and 

introduces the measured reactive sample into the analyz- 
ing device (3). The analyzing device (3) optically 

detects components separated from the sample through 
electrophoresis. The above operations are generally 

controlled under the controller (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a micro-reactor 
device in which a minute of sample material is 
made to react in a microscopic area and also to a minute 
sample analysis system which uses the micro-reactor 
device. As a method for causing reaction between sample 
and reactive reagent on a flow basis, a flow injection 
analysis is general wherein sample is introduced into 
reactive reagent and made to react therewith during flow 
of the sample liquid to be subjected to a concentration 
measurement by an optical detection method based on its 
absorbance, which details are shown, for example, in 
Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 50(1978), pp. 832A-846A or in 
Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 53(1981), pp. 20A-32A or in 
Analytica Chimica Acta, Vol. 78(1975), pp. 145-157. In the case where such a liquid feeding pump of 
a mechanical drive type as used in the above-mentioned 
flow injection analysis, flow within a flow passage 
becomes such laminar flow having a flow profile 41 as 
shown in Fig. 2. The laminar flow has such a velocity 
distribution that the flow has a velocity of substantially 
zero at its both ends due to the flow resistance 
of walls 42 and 43 of the passage and has a maximum  
 
velocity at its central part. For this reason, there 
occurs a problem that such a difference in the flow 
velocity within the passage causes the injected sample to 
flow through the passage without keeping its original 
shape. And consequently, band broadening of the injected 
sample as a result of mixing with the solution at its 
front and rear ends thereof, results in a decrease of 
concentration of the sample liquid and in an increase of 
volume in the sample. In this connection, a pressure drop Δp is 
expressed as a Hagen-Poiseuille law which follows. 
Δp = 8µlQ/πr⁴ where µ denotes the viscosity of the liquid, 1 denotes 
the length of the passage, Q denotes flow quantity, and r 
denotes the radius of the passage. That is, the pressure drop increases inversely 
proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the 
passage. For this reason, when a capillary as small as 
below 100µm is used as the passage for the purpose of 
handling such a very small amount of sample as nanoliter 
level, the pressure drop becomes large, which involves 
another problem of withstanding pressure within the 
apparatus, that is, which requires a special measure of 
providing a pressure resistive property to the wall 
material of the passage and also to a coupling part 
between the passages to be taken. Thus, there have not been so far
