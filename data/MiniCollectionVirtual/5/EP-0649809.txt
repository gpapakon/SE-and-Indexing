<ABSTRACT>
For making sample cards, a semi-automatic machine having a roller mounting (12) in the rear region (3) of a housing (1) is proposed. An adhesive-coated foil-like carrier material (10) having a feed perforation at the edge bears on the roller mounting (12). By means of two computer-controlled tractor feeds (20), the carrier material can be displaced in steps over a working surface (7). After the fabric sample has been glued by hand on the carrier material (10) and transported further, the carrier material to which the sample is glued can be detached. This purpose is served by a longitudinal slot which is provided in the working surface and into which a cutting member can be guided.

<CLAIMS>
Semiautomatic machine for making sample cards, in which it has a casing 
(1) with a roller holder (12) located in the rear area (3) and a working 

surface, characterized in that the rollers contain a film-like carrier 
material (10) provided on both sides with an adhesive coating and having 

terminal feed holes and in the casing (1) are provided two marginally 
positioned, motor-driven computer traction feeds (20) and that in the working 

surface (7) is provided an elongated slot (9) perpendicular to the 
carrier material feed direction for guiding a cutting member. 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
two traction feeds (20) mounted on two parallel shafts (33, 34) perpendicular 

to the feed direction of the carrier material (100 are driven within 
the casing (1), one shaft (33) being drivable by means of a toothed belt 

by a controlled electric motor (M). 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
two traction feeds (20) on the two parallel shafts (33, 34) are displaceably 

located in the running direction thereof. 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
working surface (7) passes in downwardly inclined manner in the feed direction 

from the roller holder (12) in the rear area (3) of the casing (1) 
towards the front (2). 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
roller holder (12) is positioned in flush manner in a trough (5) in the 

casing (1). 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
working surface (7) is crossed in the area between the traction feeds (20) 

and the elongated slot (9) by a holding down bar (21), whose side directed 
towards the working surface (7) is provided with an antistick coating. 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
front area (2) of the working surface (7) is covered by a crossbeam (22) 

with depositing surface (23), below which passes the carrier material (10)  
 

to which are stuck the samples. 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
light source is positioned in the vicinity of the elongated slot (9) below 

the working surface (7). 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
casing (1) is provided laterally of the working surface (7) with an attachment 

(14), in which is located the drive motor (M) for the traction feeds 
(20), and in which is housed the control of the motor (M). 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
control comprises a selector switch (17) for operation with hand or foot 

switch actuation (18, 46), as well as a preselector switch (19) for setting 
the feed length. 
Semiautomatic machine according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
bottom of the trough (5) is raised into an upwardly inclined discharge 

surface, which passes into the working surface (7), accompanied by the 
formation of a deflecting edge (8).
