<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mechanism (9) for actuating a striking work, said mechanism being disposed between a timer (11), which is used to countdown and to display a pre-determined time interval on a dial, and a strike train (14) in order to make said striking work heard when the timer has counted down completely.  The inventive mechanism essentially comprises a lever (1) which is fitted with a leaf spring (3) and a jewel (2).

Mechanism (9) for triggering a striking work fitted to a timepiece (6), the
later including a strike train (14) actuated by a barrel (7), 
characterised in that
 said
trigger mechanism is arranged between a timer (11) for counting down and displaying

on a dial (13) a predetermined time interval, and the strike train (14) for making said
striking work hear when the timer reaches the end of the countdown.
Mechanism according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it includes a lever
(1) inserted between the timer (11) and the strike train (14), said lever including a

pivoting shaft (15) and first (16) and second (17) portions located on either side of
said shaft, said first portion (16) being arranged to be actuated by the timer (11) when

the latter reaches the end of the countdown and said second portion (17) being
arranged to lock the strike train (14) during the countdown and to unlock said strike

train when said timer reaches the end of the countdown.
Mechanism according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the timer (11)
includes a minute wheel (8) on the shaft (18) on which is mounted a set of hands (19,

20, 21) displaying the time interval, said wheel (8) carrying a plate (22) provided with a

beak (6), 
in that
 the first portion (16) of the lever (1) carries a leaf spring (3), one end
of which (23) is capable of being contacted by the beak (6) of the plate (22) to drive

the lever (1) in rotation, and 
in that
 the second portion (17) of the lever (1) carries a
locking stone (2) co-operating with a notch (24) made in a wheel set (5) of the strike

train (14) to lock the latter during the countdown.
Mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the plate (22) is
fixed to the minute wheel (8) by a screw (26) allowing the beak (6) of said plate to be

oriented with respect to the toothing (27) of the wheel.
Mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the stone (2)
carried by the second portion (17) of the lever (1) is held in the notch (24) of the wheel

set (5) of the strike train (14) by means of a leaf spring (4) pressing on said second
portion.
Mechanism according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 an adjustment
device (28) is implemented on the leaf spring (4) to adjust the pressure thereof on the

second portion (17) of the lever (1 ).
Mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the wheel set (5)
of the strike train (14) in which the notch (24) for co-operating with the stone (2) of the

lever (1) is made, is a centrifugal governor located at the end of the strike train (14).
Mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the countdown
drives the minute wheel (8) and the beak (6) which is associated with it in a direction 

(A) such that, when the beak contacts the leaf spring (3), the latter is arranged not to
bend, which drives the lever (1) in rotation and triggers the striking work mechanism.
Mechanism according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 when the minute
wheel (8) is driven in an opposite direction (B) to that which it has when it is counting

down, particularly when it is used as a chronograph minute counter, the leaf spring (3)
is arranged to bend when the beak (6) associated with the wheel (8) contacts said

leaf, such that the lever (1) allows the beak to pass without forcing the mechanism.
Mechanism according to claim 8 or claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the leaf
spring (3) abuts against a shoulder (29) made in the first portion (16) of the lever (1),

the end (23) of said leaf spring exceeding said first portion (16), said end (23)
representing the place contacted by the beak (6) associated with the minute wheel (8).
