<ABSTRACT>
A method of and module for allocating recording space on a recording medium for recording an entry of predetermined length, the recording medium having an associated directory (30), which directory (30) lists blocks specifying free space and previously recorded entries, the method comprising the steps of receiving a start position on the recording medium (21), determining with the aid of the directory (30) the consecutive blocks necessary for recording at least the entry of predetermined length, starting from the start position (22), displaying the directory (23) and indicating the consecutive blocks in the directory (24), for example, by a frame (31) around the consecutive blocks. The module may advantageously be included in a video recorder system (10) or another recorder system using recording media.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method of and apparatus for allocating recording space on a recording mediumThe present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for allocating recording space on a recording medium. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of allocating recording space on a recording medium for recording an entry of predetermined length, the recording medium having a directory associated with it, which directory lists blocks specifying free space and previously recorded entries, the method comprising the steps of receiving a start position on the recording medium, determining with the aid of the directory the consecutive blocks necessary for recording at least the entry of predetermined length, starting from the start position, and displaying the directory.In accordance with a further aspect, the present invention relates to a module for allocating recording space on a recording medium for recording an entry of predetermined length, the module comprising memory means for storing a directory associated with the recording medium, which directory lists blocks specifying free space and previously recorded entries, and processing means connected to the memory means for receiving a start position on the recording medium, and determining the consecutive blocks necessary for recording at least the entry of predetermined length, starting from the start position.The present invention relates to recording media, such as linear recording media, in which information can only be accessed sequentially. The recording media may, e.g. be audio tape, video tape, for recording information in an analog or in a digital manner, or other data storage media, e.g. for use in computer applications. The recording medium in all these cases is magnetic tape, which is a low cost medium as compared with media for random access devices.Alternatively, the recording medium may be a random access recording medium, which is used for recording data or information in a sequential format. In this case, the data or information may physically be located on non-sequential parts of the recording medium.Document WO 93/04473 discloses a method of and system for providing a program directory on a video tape cassette. The directory lists programs recorded on the cassette tape and serves to facilitate allocation and deallocation of space on the tape for 

recording purposes. The directory may be stored on the tape itself or in an external memory. A user of a video recorder can use the directory to assign space on a video tape for the

CLAIMS:
1. A method of allocating recording space on a recording medium for recording an entry of predetermined length, the recording medium having an associated directory (30), which directory (30) lists blocks specifying free space and previously recorded entries, the method comprising the steps of receiving a start position on the recording medium (step 21); determining with the aid of the directory (30) the consecutive blocks necessary for recording at least the entry of predetermined length, starting from the start position (step 22); and displaying the directory (step 23), characterized in that the method comprises a further step of indicating the consecutive blocks in the displayed directory (step 24).
2. A method according to claim 1 , in which the start position is determined by a search algorithm.
3. A method according to claim 1 , in which the start position is determined in that start position input is received from a user.
4. A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, in which the directory (30) is displayed in a text-only format.
5. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the consecutive blocks are displayed so as to be discemable from the rest of the displayed directory.
6. A method according to claim 5, in which the consecutive blocks are indicated by displaying a frame (31) around the consecutive blocks, highlighting or underlining the consecutive blocks, or by a color, font, character size or typography different from the other directory blocks. 

7. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the predetermined length corresponds to an amount of recording time.
8. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the predetermined length corresponds to an amount of data.
9. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the method comprises a further step (step 27) of calculating the difference between the lengths of the consecutive blocks and the predetermined length, and of displaying the difference.
10. A module (12) for allocating recording space on a recording medium for recording an entry of predetermined length, the module comprising memory means (13) for storing a directory (30) associated with the recording medium, which directory (30) lists blocks specifying free space and previously recorded entries; and processing means (14) connected to the memory means ( 13) for receiving a start position on the recording medium, and determining the consecutive blocks necessary for recording at least the entry of predetermined length, starting from the start position, characterized in that the processing means (14) are adapted to indicate the consecutive blocks in the displayed directory (30).
11. A module (12) according to claim 10, in which the processing means (14) are adapted to determine the start position by a search algorithm.
12. A module (12) according to claim 10, in which the processing means (14) are adapted to receive the start position input from a user.
13. A module (12) according to claim 10, 11 or 12, in which the processing means (14) are further adapted to display the directory (30) in a text-only format.
14. A module (12) according to any one of the claims 10 through 13, in which the processing means (14) are further adapted to display the consecutive blocks so as to be discemable from the rest of the displayed directory. 

15. A module (12) according to claim 14, in which the processing means (14) are further adapted to indicate the consecutive blocks by displaying a frame (31) around the consecutive blocks, highlighting or underlining the consecutive blocks, or by a color, font, character size or typography different from the other directory blocks.
16. A module (12) according to any one of the claims 10 through 15, in which the processing means (14) are further adapted to calculating a difference between the lengths of the consecutive blocks and the predetermined length, and to display the difference.
17. A video recorder system (10) including a module (12) according to any one of the claims 10 through 16.
18. A computer program product comprising data and instructions to be loaded into a computer, thereby enabling the computer to carry out the method according to any one of the claims 1 through 9.
