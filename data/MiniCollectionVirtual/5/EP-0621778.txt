<DESCRIPTION>
 M. fermentans infection treatment.This present application relates to a method for treating Mycoplasma fermentans-iaά ceά infections and to compositions for use in such treatment.Mycoplasma fermentans has in the past been suspected of being a human pathogen, having been occasionally isolated from human urogenital tract, from bone marrow of leukaemic patients, from synovial effusions of rheumatoid patients, as well as from tissue cultures. More recently, AIDS researchers have identified a strain of mycoplasma, since identified as M. fermentans, which it is thought may act as co-factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS (Science, vol 248, 11th May 1990). In addition, these same mycoplasma have been implicated in fulminant infections of non-AIDS patients (Amer. J. Trop. Med., Hyg, 42(5), 1990, 399). The provision of a chemotherapeutic agent with activity against M. fermentans would therefore be of assistance in the treatment of such patients.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating humans infected with M. fermentans, in particular humans also infected with HIV, which method comprises treating humans in need of such therapy with an anti-mycoplasmal effective amount of a compound of formula (I):
 in which R° denotes:(a) a group R which is a 5-membered heterocyclic group having a 6π-electron system with up to four heteroatoms which may be selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, and optionally substituted with two substituents R^ and ^ which may be the same or different and is each selected from (Cι_2θ)alkyl, (C2-8)alkenyl, (C3„7)cycloalkyl, aryl(Cι_ g)alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl, each of which may be optionally substituted; or(b) a group -COR^ in which R4 denotes an optionally substituted phenyl group. 

 In a further aspect, the invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for treating M. fermentans - induced infection.When used herein, the term 'aryl' includes for example phenyl and naphthyl optionally substituted with up to five, preferably up to three, groups selected from halogen, optionally substituted (Cι_g)alkyl, phenyl,(Cι_g)alkoxy, halo(Cι_g)alkyl, hydroxy, amino, mono- or di-(Cι_ g)alkylamino, nitro, carboxy, (Cι_g)alkoxycarbonyl, optionally substituted(Cι_g)alkoxycarbonyl(C-t_.g)alkyl, (Cι_g)alkylcarbonyloxy, (Cχ_ g)alkylcarbonyl, (Cι_g)alkylthio, (Cι_g)alkanesulphinyl, and (Cj.6)alkanesulphonyl.When used herein and unless otherwise defined, the term'heterocyclyl' includes for example single or fused

Claims
The use of a compound of formula (I):
OH

 in which R° denotes:
(a) a group R^* which is a 5-membered heterocyclic group having a 6π-electron system with up to four heteroatoms which may be selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, and optionally substituted with two substituents R^ and ^ which may be the same or different and each is selected from (Cι_2())alkyl, (C2-8)alkenyl, (C3_7)cycloalkyl, aryl(Cι_ g)alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl, each of which may be optionally substituted; or
(b) a group -COR^ in which R
4
- denotes an optionally substituted phenyl group; in the manufacture of a medicament for treating M. fermentans - induced infection in humans.
2. A use as claimed in claim 1 in which the human subject is also infected with HIV.
3. A use as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which R^ denotes a group:

 in which R^ and R^ are as hereinbefore defined,
Xis a divalent group -Y-C=C-, and Y is oxygen or sulphur; for instance an oxazolyl, thiazolyl, isoxazolyl or isothiazolyl, preferably oxazolyl and especially oxazol-2-yl; or a group which is a trivalent, 5-membered heterocyclic group having a 6-π electron system, bonded via carbon, the five ring atoms being either one carbon atom and four atoms selected from carbon and nitrogen, two 


carbon atoms, two nitrogen atoms and one atom selected from oxygen and sulphur, or four carbon atoms and one atom selected from oxygen and sulphur, and R^ and R^ are as defined in claim 1 and are each substituents on a carbon or nitrogen.
4. A use as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the group R* denotes a group of the formula:

 in which R 
>
 denotes an optionally substituted isoxazol-5-yl, a fur-2-yl, a fur-3-yl or a pyridyl group bonded by a carbon atom thereof to the oxazolyl moiety.
