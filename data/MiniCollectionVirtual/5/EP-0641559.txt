<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new aqueous cosmetic compositions which are suitable, in particular, for removing films of polymers, such as films of varnish applied to the surface of the nails, by dissolution.   It also relates to the use of the abovementioned compositions, in particular as solvents for films of nail varnish. The cosmetic compositions of the invention display good dissolving power, are stable and homogeneous, do not remove lipids and can be free from dissolving intermediaries and/or from surfactants.

Aqueous dissolving cosmetic composition, in 
particular which dissolves polymer films, comprising a 

mixture of methyl acetate and water in which the weight 
proportions between the methyl acetate and the water are 

between 90/10 and 60/40. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1, in 
which the said proportions are between 80/20 and 70/30. 
Cosmetic composition according to either of the 
preceding claims, which is in a stable, homogeneous form. 
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the 
preceding claims, which is in the form of a liquid or a 

gel. 
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the 
preceding claims, which is free of surfactants. 
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the 
preceding claims, which is free of organic intermediary 

solvents. 
Cosmetic composition according to any one of the 
preceding claims, which contains cosmetically acceptable 

adjuvants. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 7, in 
which the said adjuvants are chosen, alone or as 

mixtures, from nail-treating agents, preserving agents, 
dyes, fragrances, UV screening agents, gelling agents, 

opalescent agents and plant oils. 
Use of a composition as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims as, or for the manufacture of, an agent 

for dissolving polymer films. 
Use according to Claim 9, in which the said 
polymer films are films of na
il varnish.  
 
Use according to Claim 10, in which the said 
films of nail varnish are based on nitrocellulose and/or 

on acrylic polymers and/or on alkyd resins and/or on 
grafted chlorinated copolymers resulting from the 

grafting of at least one chlorinated polyolefin with one 
or more unsaturated monomers of the acrylic, styrene 

and/or vinyl type. 
Process for removing polymer films deposited on 
supports, which consists in applying a composition as 

defined in any one of Claims 1 to 8 to the said films. 
Process according to Claim 12, for removing films 
of varnish deposited on the nails. 
Process according to Claim 13, in which the said 
films of nail varnish are based on nitrocellulose and/or 

on acrylic polymers and/or on alkyd resins and/or on 
grafted chlorinated copolymers resulting from the 

grafting of at least one chlorinated polyolefin with one 
or more unsaturated monomers of the acrylic, styrene 

and/or vinyl type.
