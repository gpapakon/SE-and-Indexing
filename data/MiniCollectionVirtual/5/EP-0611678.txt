<ABSTRACT>
The rear spoiler for motor vehicles is a hollow element produced from plastic using the blow moulding method. In the attachment position the rear spoiler has an upper and lower large side wall, between which side walls, viewed from the rear of the vehicle, a rectangular opening is provided, which opening serves to receive a component. The short lateral side edges of the rectangular opening are arranged countersunk in the rear spoiler and are directed counter to the direction of insertion of the component. The component is in contact with the outside of the short side edges and is detachably fastened to the short side edges by means of attachment elements. A wall section which extends approximately over the entire length of the component and engages with its free end under the lower long side edge of the rectangular opening of the rear spoiler is attached to the lower side of the component.

Rear spoiler for motor vehicles, comprising an 
elongate hollow body made from a blow-moulded plastic 

which is mounted on the vehicle in longitudinal 
extension thereof, so as to run at right angles to 

the vehicle's longitudinal axis, and having the 
following characteristics: 


the rear spoiler (1) is a flat construction and at 
the top and bottom it features respective large-area 

lateral panels (5 and 6) between which, viewed from 
the rear of the vehicle (3), the rear spoiler (1) 

incorporates a rectangular opening (8) whose long 
lateral edges (14 and 15) extend in the direction of 

the longitudinal extension of the rear spoiler (1), 
a component (9 or 10, respectively) is inserted into 
the rectangular opening (8) in the rear spoiler (1), 

in the direction of forward travel of the vehicle 
(3), and is joined to the rear spoiler (1) in a 

detachable manner by means of fastening elements (22, 
23),
 
characterised in that 
the short lateral edges (13) of the rectangular 
opening (8) are set low in the rear spoiler (1), away 

from the direction (Y) in which the component (9 or 
10, respectively) was inserted, and the outside of 

said edges is used to act as a supporting surface for 
the component (9 or 10, respectively), 
the fastening elements (22, 23) of the component (9 
or 10, respectively) are accessible from the front 

and are fastened in a detachable manner to the short 
lateral edges (13) of the rectangular opening (8),  

 
the underside of the component (9 or 10, 
respectively) features a wall section (20) which 

extends approximately the whole length of the 
component (9 or 10, respectively), has its free end 

facing in the direction (Y) in which the component 
was inserted, and externally overlaps the lower long 

lateral edge (14) of the rectangular opening (8) in 
the rear spoiler. 
Rear spoiler according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the component (9) is a cover (10) which takes 

the place of a motor vehicle lamp (9). 
Rear spoiler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the upper large-area side panel (5) of the 

rear spoiler (1), proceeding from the short lateral 
edges (13) of the opening (8), overhangs by a rim 

section (16) which points towards the back of the 
vehicle. 
Rear spoiler according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the rim section (16) which overhangs the opening 

(8) is a double-walled construction and its lower 
wall panel merges into the two short lateral edges 

(13) of the opening (8). 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the short lateral edges (13) 

and the lower long edge of the rectangular opening 
(8) extend in approximately the same plane. 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the lateral edge portion (24) 

of the opening (8) overlapping with the wall section 
(20) of the component (9 or 10, respectively) is 

offset towards the top by such an amount that the 
outside of the overlap, and hence the outside of the  

 
wall section (20) of the component, extends flush 

with the contiguous external surface of the rear 
spoiler (1). 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the overlap is constituted by 

a tongue and groove joint in which the lower long 
lateral edge (14) of the opening (8) is the tongue, 

which engages in a groove (25) in the component (9 or 
10, respectively). 
Rear spoiler according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the groove is a free end portion, bent into a U-shaped 

cross-section, of the wall section (20) of the 
component (9 or 10, respectively). 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that each of the short lateral edges 

(13) of the rectangular opening (8) incorporates a 
fixing opening into which engages a fixing screw 

acting as a fastening means (22) and passing through 
an opening in the component (9 or 10, respectively). 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that when a motor vehicle lamp is 

used as the component, the outside of the lower wall 
section (20) runs flush with the outside of a 

transparent cover plate (18) of the motor vehicle 
lamp. 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that a
 metal plate (23) of U-shaped 
cross-section, acting as a nut for the fixing screw 

(22), is pushed in self-locking or gripping manner 
onto the short lateral edges (23) of the rectangular 

opening (8).  
 
Rear spoiler according to claim 10 or 11,charcterised 
in that the wall section (20) of the component (9 or 

10, respectively) is a separate part and is 
permanently joined to a wall of the motor vehicle 

lamp housing. 
Rear spoiler according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterised in that the wall section (20) is 

constructed in one piece with the transparent cover 
plate (18) or a side wall of a motor vehicle lamp 

housing. 
Rear spoiler according to any of claims 10 to 13, 
characterised in that the groove (25) of the tongue 

and groove joint is constituted by the wall section 
(20) and the adjoining side wall of the housing (18, 

19) of the motor vehicle lamp.
