<ABSTRACT>
Device for damping dynamic stresses originating, particularly, from the recoil of a firearm and for automatic adaptation to the shape (morphology) of the user, characterised in that it comprises at least one support plate (3), produced from a rigid section, integral with the body (6) of the object generating the dynamic stresses, which section is located within the object/user gripping zones, the said plate being equipped with a non-stretch, flexible, leaktight pocket (7), particularly made from fabric and enclosing it, the free inner space thus formed being filled with at least one material (11) possessing both the properties of being deformable at rest and of changing when dynamic stresses arise, and it also includes a device (13) for pressurising the said envelope (7) and interacting both with the said support plate (3) and the said material (11).

Device for damping dynamic loadings originating, notably, from 
the recoil of a firearm and for the automatic adaptation to the 

morphology of the user, comprising at least one support plate 
(3), made from a rigid profiled material, integral with the body 

(6) of the object that generates the dynamic loadings, situated 
at the positions of the user-object gripping zones, said plate 

being equipped with an inextensible, flexible, leaktight pocket 
(7), notably of fabric and enclosing it, the internal free space 

thus formed being filled with a material (11), and it comprises 
in addition a device for pressurizing said envelope (7) and 

cooperating both with said support plate (3) and said material 
(11), characterized in that the material (11) is in the form of 

a soft, amorphous paste, which possesses both the properties of 
being deformable when at rest for adapting to the morphology of 

the user at the position of his interface zones with the object 
and also of becoming rigid virtually instantaneously in the case 

of impulsive dynamic loadings. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the rigid 
component (2) is generally constituted of a profile (3) of wood, 

composite material, or of an aluminium or aluminium alloy 
construction, which cannot deform plastically except within very 

restricted ranges, and is equipped on at least one of its flanks 
(4) with a plurality of ribs (5) which cooperate when required 

with the body (6) of the object generating the dynamic loadings. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the envelope (7) of fabric is secured to the plate (3) by a 

retaining ring (8) seated in a peripheral groove (9) situated on 
the edge face of said plate (3), and thus surrounding a fold 

(10) of the fabric of the envelope (7).  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that, for increasing the transfer of the shear 

stresses, necessary for the rigidifying of the material (11) on 
the recoil of the weapon, there is added to this material within 

the envelope (7) a plurality of bodies capable of being present, 
notably, in the form of microspheres (12) having a different 

density from that of said material. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the content of the envelope (7) is raised 

to a relative pressure of 1 to 2 bars by the compression of said 
material (11) by the penetration of an element (13), such as a 

screw, into the material, this element (13) being, for example, 
screwed into the support plate (3) and then penetrating into the 

envelope (7) containing said material (11). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that chicanes are also provided, disposed on 

the support plate (3) in contact with said material (11), in 
order to create the desired shear phenomenon. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the material (11) contained in its 

envelope (7) may be separated from the support plate (3) and, in 
this case, may be carried by the user or be integrated within 

one of his garments.
