<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of dibutyltin oxide preparations which contain, as the dispersing medium, a pigment paste resin and a specific combination of surfactants. In combination with cationic coating binders, which can be cross-linked by transesterification and/or transurethanisation and/or reaction of terminal double bonds, these dibutyltin oxide preparations are suitable for the formulation of cathodically depositable electro-dipping primers which are distinguished by very good stability during storage (long shelf life) - even in dilute form -, by little current being required during the deposition and by defect-free surfaces, both of the coating films which have not been cross-linked and those which have been baked.

Process for preparing dibutyltin oxide preparations 
for catalysing the crosslinking reactions of 

cationic paint binders, characterized in that the mechanical 
dispersion of dibutyltin oxide to a particle size 

of from 0.1 to max. 0.5 Âµm is carried out using a dispersion 
medium which comprises 


(A) from 60 to 75% by weight of a pigment paste resin 
based on modified epoxy resin-amine adducts, 
(B) from 10 to 20% by weight of 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol 
(C) from 10 to 20% by weight of a nonionic surfactant 
based on ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymers 

whose polypropylene block has a molar mass of about 
1750 g/mol a
nd whose proportion of polyethylene 
oxide in the total molecule is from 20 to 80% by 

weight, 
 
the quantitative proportions (based on solids) being 

chosen such that the percentages for components (A), (B) 
and (C) must add up to 100, and the dibutyltin oxide 

preparations having a tin content, based on component 
(A), of from 45 to 85% by weight, preferably from 55 to 

75% by weight. 
Use of the dibutyltin oxide preparations prepared 
according to Claim 1, in combination with cationic paint 

binders which can be crosslinked by transesterification 
and/or transurethanization and/or reaction of terminal 

double bonds, to formulate cathodic electrodeposition 
coating materials, with the proviso that coating 

materials formulated accordingly contain from 0.2 to 2.0% 
by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 1.5% by weight, of tin,  

 
based on the solids content of the total binder, in the 

form of the dibutyltin oxide preparations.
