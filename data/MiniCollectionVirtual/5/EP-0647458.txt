<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes an admixing device (2) for admixing additives to a liquid (14), especially to a solvent, for example in fire-fighting vehicles (1). Arranged in a delivery conduit (18) for the liquid (14) is a measurement transducer (8) for the throughflow quantity in this delivery conduit (18). Connected to a supply conduit (41) of the delivery conduit (18) is a drive device (30) for a conveying device (27) which conveys the additive from an additive tank (5) into an admixing conduit (19). The throughflow quantity of the liquid (14) through the drive device (30) is regulated via a regulating device (52) in dependence on the liquid quantity flowing through the delivery conduit (18). The drive device (30) is motionally connected to the conveying device. The supply conduit (41) for the drive device (30, 132) branches off upstream of the measuring device in the direction of flow of the liquid (14). The regulating device (52, 152) is located downstream of the drive device (30, 132) in the direction of flow of the liquid (14). There is arranged a control and/or indicator device (7, 138) which has a measurement transducer (8) of the measuring device and an input member (24) for a quantity of additives which can be added to a predeterminable liquid quantity or a measuring apparatus (145) for detecting the fed quantity of additives.
