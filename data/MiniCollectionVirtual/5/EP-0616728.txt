<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention relates generally to 
protection devices for integrated circuits, and more particularly to 
low trigger voltage protection devices. Many attempts have been made in the prior art to protect 
semiconductor devices, including bipolar transistors, field effect 
devices, and integrated circuits against damage due to voltage and 
current transients. Such protection devices have commonly taken the 
form of diode or transistor circuits that have been incorporated on the 
integrated circuit chip for internal transient protection. The design 
engineer is nevertheless faced with the problem of having to use 
valuable chip space for forming protection devices. Particularly on 
devices containing a large number of pins, it has been found that the 
protection devices occupy a significant amount of space and, therefore, 
the chip can become undesirably large. Protection circuits advantageously utilizing silicon controlled 
rectifier (SCR) arrangements are known, for example, from U.S. Patent 
Nos 4,631,657. 4,633,283; and 5,072,273. In typical SCR arrangements utilised in the protection of 
integrated circuits, the trigger or firing voltage under quasistatic 
conditions is on the order of 25 volts to 40 volts. However, in 
practice, pulse conditions typically prevail and the actual trigger 
voltage is generally higher because of the time taken to establish the 
plasma. When such an SCR arrangement is utilized as part of an ESD 
protection circuit on a VLSI chip, for example, damage to other parts 
of the chip could occur before the "snap-back" SCR conduction regime 
has been established, i.e. before the SCR has achieved its "shorted" 
state. It is therefore desirable to achieve a lower trigger voltage 
for the SCR. U.S.Patent Application No. 07/700314 Avery disclosed 
methods for reducing the trigger voltage of the SCR. As device 
geometries have shrunk to submicron dimensions the need for even lower 
trigger voltage protection devices which can be fabricated with a 
predictable trigger voltage to protect the thing gate oxide have become 
necessary. WO-A-9014691 discloses a protection device corresponding to the 
preamble of claim 1. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided 
a protection device comprising: 
a semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type having a 
surface;  a first region of second conductivity type in said substrate at 
said surface and having a boundary with said substrate; a second region of said second conductivity type within said
