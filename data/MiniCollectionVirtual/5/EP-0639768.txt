<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling the velocity 
of electroosmotic flow (EOF) in high performance 

capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) are provided. The 
interior surface of the capillary tube is coated with a 

zwitterionic coating, such that the pH range within 
which EOF velocity may be controlled is broadened. The 

zwitterionic coating involves covalent, ionic or 
adsorptive binding of a zwitterionic species such as 

phosphoryl choline to the capillary wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
capillary electrophoresis. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a novel method for carrying out 
capillary electrophoresis using zwitterion-coated 
capillary tubes. The use of zwitterionic coatings in 
turn provides for greater control over electroosmotic 
flow and minimizes adsorption of components contained 
within the sample solution. The invention additionally 
relates to an apparatus for performing the novel method. Separation of chemical entities is possible using 
the technique of "electrophoresis", a method which is 
premised upon the differential migration of solutes in 
an electric field. In high performance capillary 
electrophoresis (HPCE), a technique developed in the 
early 1980's, electrophoretic separation is performed in 
narrow capillary tubes, typically 25 µm to 75 µm in 
diameter, which are filled with a conducting solution, 
normally a buffer. A small amount of sample is 
introduced at one end of the capillary tube, followed by 
application of a high potential difference across the 
ends of the tube. Electroosmotic flow (also termed 
"electroendoosmotic flow", or EOF) and differences in 
electrophoretic mobilities combine to provide a spatial 
separation of the constituents of the sample solution. HPCE has numerous advantages, particularly with 
respect to the detrimental effects of Joule heating. 
The high electrical resistance of the narrow capillary 
tube enables the application of very strong electric 
fields, in the range of 100 to 500 V/cm, with only 
minimal heat generation. Additionally, the large 
surface-to-volume ratio of the capillary enables 
efficient dissipation of the heat that is generated  
 
during the separation process. Further, the use of high 
electric fields gives rise to shorter analysis times (on 
the order of ten minutes or less) than required for 
conventional electrophoretic separations, high 
separation efficiency, and superior resolution. Peak 
efficiency, often in excess of 10⁵ theoretical plates, 
is due in part to the plug profile of the EOF, which 
also enables the simultaneous analysis of all solutes, 
regardless of charge. Finally, HPCE allows for use of 
relatively simple instrumentation, on-line detection 
through the capillary wall, and very small sample 
volumes (on the order of 1 to 10 nl). The underlying principles of electrophoretic 
separation are quite simple, and may be summarized as 
follows. Separation of constituents in a sample is 
enabled based on differences in solute velocity in
