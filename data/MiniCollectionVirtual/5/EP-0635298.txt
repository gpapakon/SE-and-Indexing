<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst and a method for
reducing nitrogen oxides contained in waste gases such as
combustion waste gases or waste gases from chemical plants
in the presence of a reducing agent such as ammonia. More
particularly, the invention relates to a catalyst and a method
for reducing nitrogen oxides stably and effectively into
nitrogen and water over a long period of time even at a
temperature as high as more than about 500째CNitrogen oxides are contained in combustion waste gases
from boilers, heating furnaces, gas turbines or diesel engines
or waste gases from chemical plants for products such
as nitric acid. The nitrogen oxides are noxious and it is
necessary to remove the oxides from the waste gases. Thus,
a denitrizing process has been put to practical use wherein
the waste gas is contacted with a catalyst in the presence
of, for example, ammonia as a reducing agent.A number of catalysts have been proposed and put to
practical use heretofor; however, all the known catalysts
have effective activity for reduction of nitrogen oxides
only at a relatively low temperature. There has been
found no catalyst which has high and stable activity over
a wide range of temperatures, low to high, such as more than
500째C, for a long period. However, such a catalyst 
is in fact needed in some fields of denitrization.For instance, when a gas turbine or diesel engine is
started, the resultant exhaust gas rapidly reaches a high
temperature, and such a catalyst as above mentioned is needed
to denitrize such an exhaust gas effectively and stably.It is already known that a catalyst mainly composed of
titanium and tungsten is fairly resistant to heat, as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Publication No. 52-35342. However, the
catalyst is found to have low activity at low temperature,
and moreover it is found not to have stable
activity over a long period.A catalyst of titanium and vanadium is
known, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 54-2912,
and a catalyst of titanium, tugsten and
vanadium is also known, as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 50-128681. These catalysts have
fairly good reduction activity for nitrogen oxides at low
temperature; however, they are found not to have
stable activity at high temperature.A further catalyst is known which contains at least
one element selected from titanium, copper, chromium, tungsten,
molybdenum, iron and nickel, in addition to vanadium and
niobium, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 51-87485. This catalyst is
