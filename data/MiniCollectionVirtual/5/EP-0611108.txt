<ABSTRACT>
A small-sized, lightweight portable telephone has a microphone 
(17) mounted on a rotatable arm (3) that can be released into a use 

position using only one hand, which is also grasping the telephone. 
Even if an excessive load is applied to the microphone arm (3), which 

is rotatably supported relative to a telephone main member (2), 
damage is prevented by a spring-loaded detent mechanism. The 

microphone arm (3) has built in it a core member (20) formed of a 
shape-memory alloy and constituted by a flexible casing, so that 

deformation can occur without permanent damage to the arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to portable telephones.The number of subscribers to the portable telephone
system is drastically increasing due to improved performance
of the component parts, better calling capabilities due to
improved and more accurate radio relay stations, lower fees,
as well as changes in business configuration and social
environment. Therefore, demand is raised for a portable
telephone that is reduced in size and weight, that is of a
so-called pocket size, and which nevertheless has a
transmitter, a receiver, a dial switch, a radio call circuit,a
power battery and so forth.The sheet switch configuration of the dial switch, the
development of a high-performance battery, and the improved
integration degree of electronic parts have led to significant
reductions in weight. Nevertheless, because it is necessary
for the transmitter and the receiver of the telephone to be
arranged at a relative distance equal to the interval between
the ear and the mouth and because of other functional
constraints, the overall size of the telephone is determined 
by the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, that
is, between the speaker and the microphone.Generally, in a telephone it is preferred to set the
linear distance between the speaker and the microphone and the
angle therebetween to 13.5 to 14.3 cm and about 23.3° to
13.4°, respectively. Because of these design constraints a
telephone has been proposed that is partitioned into a
transmitter side section or block with the microphone and a
receiver side section or block with the speaker, and these two
blocks are adapted to be collapsible or foldable for reducing
the overall size. Examples of such telephones are disclosed in
FR-A-2594616 and US-A-4845772.It is possible with this type of collapsible or foldable
telephone to reduce its size to approximately one-half of the
common telephone. Nevertheless, it is necessary to partition
the control substrate, that is, the circuit board bearing the
operating and control electronics, into two separate portions
as well. Besides, owing to the collapsible construction, the
telephone is increased in thickness and moreover is difficult
to use and handle.JP-A-61-198851 discloses a hand
microphone of the type employed in a car phone having an
extension microphone similar to a telephone handset, which
extension microphone typically resides in a hand microphone
casing and which may be pulled out of the hand microphone
casing or rotated for use. In such hand microphone in which, for example, the
extension microphone

<CLAIMS>
A portable telephone, comprising:

a telephone main body (2) having a speaker (7), a dial
switch unit and a power battery;
a microphone arm (3) having a microphone (17) mounted
at one end thereof; and
a rotation supporting unit (22) for rotatably attaching
said microphone arm (3) at the other end thereof to one

side of said telephone main body (2);
characterized in that
 said rotation supporting unit
(22) includes resilient means (26) for biasing said

microphone arm (3) to rotate to a first predetermined
position relative to said telephone main body (2), and

in that said portable telephone further comprises
microphone arm holding means (34) mounted in said

telephone main body (2) for holding said microphone arm
(3) in a second predetermined position relative to said

telephone main body (2) against a biasing force of said
resilient means (26), said microphone arm holding means

(34) including operating means for releasing said
microphone arm (3) from said second predetermined

position for movement to said first predetermined
position.
The portable telephone according to claim 1, wherein
said microphone arm holding means (34) includes a pin

(36) protruding from said one side of said telephone
ma
in body (2) and said microphone arm (3) includes an
aperture (16c) for receiving said pin (36). 
The portable telephone according to claim 2, wherein
said operating means includes a resilient element (37)

for biasing said pin (36) to protrude from said
telephone main body (2) and a slide element (35)

attached to said pin (36) for movement against a
biasing force of said resilient element (37) and

retracting said pin (36) from a protruded position.
The portable telephone according to claim 1, further
comprising rotational position regulating means (28)

for regulating rotation of said microphone arm (3) upon
being released from said second predetermined position

such that said microphone arm (3) rotates to said first
predetermined position.
The portable telephone according to claim 4, wherein
said rotational position regulating means (28) is

assembled with said rotation supporting unit (22).
The portable telephone according to claim 5, further
comprising excessive rotation means formed with said

rotation supporting unit (22) for permitting rotation
of said microphone arm (3) to rotational positions

beyond said first predetermined position when a further
force exceeding said biasing force of said resilient

means (26) and in the same direction thereto is applied
to said microphone arm (3) when in said first

predetermined position.
The portable telephone according to claim 1, wherein
said operating means is arranged on said one side and 

on a back side of said telephone main body (2) for
actuation by a finger of a user of the portable

telephone.
The portable telephone according to claim 1, wherein
said microphone arm (3) is rotated by said rotation

supporting unit (22) in a plane perpendicular to a
mounting plane of said dial switch unit on said

telephone main body (2).
The portable telephone according to claim 1, wherein
said telephone main body (2) has a rectangular shape

with a width and a length and said microphone arm (3)
has a length substantially equal to the length of said

telephone main body (2).
The portable telephone according to claim 9, further
comprising a protective cradle (10) having a

substantially L-shaped cross section mounted to said
one side of said telephone main body (2) and extending

parallel to the length of said telephone main body (2),
said protective cradle (10) receiving said microphone

arm (3) in said second predetermined position.
The portable telephone according to claim 1, wherein
said microphone arm (3) is formed of a resilient

plastics material and includes a core member (20)
formed of a shape memory alloy disposed therein such

that said microphone arm (3) returns to an original
