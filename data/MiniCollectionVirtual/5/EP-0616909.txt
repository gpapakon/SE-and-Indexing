<ABSTRACT>
A castor for equipment such as, for example, rubbish containers, hospital beds or the like, to be fitted therewith in a manner which allows them to move, is provided with a castor fork (2), which supports the wheel (1), and with a swivel bearing (3), which is to be mounted on the rear of said fork, is to be secured to the equipment and comprises a swivel-bearing cup (5) and a swivel-bearing plate (7), mounted therein in a manner which allows it to swivel via an upper and lower ball race (6, 6'), the swivel-bearing cup (5), which is formed from sheet steel, being surrounded, at least in its essentially cylindrical wall region (5''), by an outer reinforcing layer (8). In order to improve and perfect the castor in such a manner that the outer reinforcing layer (8), which surrounds the swivel-bearing cup (5), can be mounted thereon in a substantially simpler manner and, moreover, also offers additional corrosion protection and substantially improved attachment possibilities for the castor locking means, the castor is designed such that the outer reinforcing layer is composed of a die-cast layer (8) which is made of plastic or a light metal alloy and is mounted on the swivel-bearing cup (5) by injection moulding or high-pressure die casting.

Caster for fitting to devices, appliances, items of equipment etc. (hereafter devices), 
such as refuse containers, hospital beds and similar items, to be enable these to be 

moved, the caster having a caster fork (2) carrying the running wheel (1) and a swivel 
bearing (3), this being fitted to the saddle (2') of the above-mentioned fork and for 

securing to the device, the swivel bearing consisting of a swivel bearing pot (5) and a 
swivel bearing plate (7) mounted therein in such a manner that the latter can rotate 

with the aid of an upper (6) and a lower (6') ball race, whereby the swivel bearing pot 
(5), which is made of shaped steel sheet, is surrounded by an external reinforcing layer 

(8) at least in that region of its wall that is essentially cylindrical (5''), characterized by 
the fact that the external reinforcing layer consists of a die-cast layer (8) of plastic or 

light-metal alloy applied to the swivel bearing pot (5) by injection moulding or 
pressure casting. 
Caster in accordance with claim 1 characterized by the fact that the die-cast layer (8) 
applied to the swivel bearing pot (5) is of a thermoplastic plastic and in particular of 

polyamide, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene. 
Caster in accordance with claim 1 characterized by the fact that the die-cast layer 
pressed on to the swivel bearing pot (5) is of an aluminium alloy such as Zamak. 
Caster in accordance with claims 1 to 3 characterized by the fact that mounting 
elements for devices for locking the caster such as toothed rims (14) or mounting 

shoulders (24) for locking levers (15 and 26 respectively) are jointly moulded with the 
die-cast layer (8''). 
Caster in accordance with claims 1 to 4 characterized by the fact that the die-cast layer 
(8) also embraces the base (5') of the swivel bearing pot (5).  

 
Caster in accordance with claims 1 to 5 in which the swivel bearing pot (5) is secured 
to the device in such a manner that it cannot rotate relative to the device and in which 

the bearing plate (7) extends out of the opening in the lower side of the swivel bearing 
pot and is connected in a fixed manner to the caster fork (2), characterized by the fact 

that a die-cast plug-in securing stud (9) is formed on the top of the die-cast layer (8) 
surrounding the swivel bearing pot (5). 
Caster in accordance with claim 6, characterized by the fact that a transversely 
positioned internally threaded bush (11) is provided in the plug-in securing stud (9) 

into which a securing screw (12) provided on the foot (10) of the device can be 
screwed. 
Caster in accordance with claim 6, characterized by the fact that a metal reinforcing 
stud (21) is secured to the base of the swivel bearing pot (5') and that the die-cast plug-in 

securing stud (9) is moulded around this metal reinforcing stud (21). 
Caster in accordance with claims 1 to 5 with a securing plate (22) secured to the 
swivel bearing pot (5) and extending laterally beyond the sides of the pot for securing 

the swivel bearing pot to the device in such a manner that there can be no relative 
rotation between the swivel bearing pot and the device and where this securing plate 

has in its middle a trough-shaped recess (22') the base of which lies flat on the base 
(5') of the swivel bearing pot (5), characterized by the fact that the trough-shaped 

recess (22') is filled with the layer (8') of die-cast material and that this layer is 
connected via through holes (22'') provided in the securing plate (22) with the other 

part (8'') of the die-cast layer, namely that surrounding the swivel bearing pot wall (5''). 
Caster in accordance with claims 1 to 5 with the swivel bearing pot (5) secured to the 
caster fork (2) and the swivel bearing plate (7) extending out of the opening at the top 

of the swivel bearing pot for connecting to the device in such a manner that it cannot 
rotate relative to the latter, characterized by the fact that the die-cast layer (8''') 

surrounding the swivel bearing pot wall (5'') also embraces the caster fork saddle (2').  
 
Caster in accordance with claim 10, characterized by the fact that the die-cast layer 
has an area (8
IV
) beneath the saddle (2') of the caster fork, this area being connected 
with the other area (8''') of the die-cast layer via through holes (2'') provided in the 

caster fork saddle (2'). 
Caster in accordance with claim 10, characterized by the fact that the caster fork (2''') 
is formed in whole or in part of die-cast material and is injection moulded or cast 

together with the die-cast layer (8
V
) surrounding the swivel bearing pot (5).
