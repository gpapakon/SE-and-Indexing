<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermosetting
resin compositions suitable as materials for electrical
apparatuses and electronic parts and comprising a
polyimide having no thermoplastic property and a
thermosetting prepolymer, these compositions showing a
modulus of elasticity of 107 to 102 dyne/cm2 in the
course of the heat curing step, and
the use of these thermosetting resin compositions as
adhesive layers in thin film wiring boards, and resin articles obtained from these compositions.Heretofore, there have been disclosed thin film
multi-layer wiring boards obtained by laminating a
plurality of thin film material layers having wiring
patterns thereon and a plurality of adhesive films
present between thin film material layers
(JP-A-2-45998).
Further, JP-A-4-206595 discloses a process for producing
a thin film multi-layer wiring board comprising laminating
a plurality of thin film material layers having
wiring patterns thereon via adhesive films and connecting
individual wiring layers by laser drilling and
plating.As adhesives for wiring boards, there have been
disclosed thermosetting resin compositions obtained by
adding bismaleimides to special polyimides (JP-A 59-179558, 
62-11662, EP-A-0342912 etc.) however, the polyimides used
therein are thermoplastic polyimides such as Polyimide
2080 (a trade name, mfd. by Mitsubishi Chemical Co.,
Ltd.). Further, there are also disclosed adhesives
obtained by adding thermosetting prepolymers to
polyimides having low softening points (JP-A 2-124971
and 2-247,273). The polyimides used therein belong to
thermoplastic polyimides according to M.I. Bessonov, et
al.(M.I. Bessonov, M.M. Koton, V.V. Kudryavtsev and L.A.
Laius: "Polyimides", pp. 185-199, (1987), published by
Plenum Publishing Corp., New York).Since the adhesives used in the above-mentioned thin
film multi-layer wiring -boards became brittle, there was a
problem in reliability regarding the practical use in
wiring boards, resulting in failing to produce thin film
wiring boards having sufficient reliability. Further, the
adhesives used in the production of thin film multi-layer
wiring boards had problems concerning the burying of the
wiring so as to obtain good surface flatness and heat
resistance, also resulting in failing to produce thin film
wiring boards having sufficient reliability.The adhesives used in the prior art were thermoplastic
polyimides having good adhesiveness to adherends
and good flowability. However, according to the prior art
processes, since the thermoplastic polyimides are low in
modulus of
