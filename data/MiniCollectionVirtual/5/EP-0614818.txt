<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rigid cradle for retaining a fragile 
container during shipping which is usable in a postcard type 
package for flowable substances according to the first part 
of claim 1. Various attempts have heretofore been made to provide a mailable 
package for fragile items. The Sparks U.S. Patent No. 2,646,876 
(hereinafter the 876 patent) discloses a mailable display package 
to hold an article for shipment which uses a thick boxboard 
to form the structure and employs a series of flaps to seal the 
package. A drawback of the 876 patent is a requirement for a thick boxboard 
that increases the weight of the shipping container, increases 
the size of the total package and increases the material 
costs. A further drawback of the boxboard is an increased difficulty 
in producing the boxboard with the required cut-outs and 
creases which results in increased production costs. A still 
further drawback of the 876 patent is the increased production 
costs involved with producing the large number of flaps. The Taylor U.S. Patent No. 4,240,547 (hereinafter the 547 
patent) discloses a compact, reusable specimen mailer to safely 
ship fragile specimens. It uses a polystyrene plastic foam to 
form the structure and employs an absorbent material around the 
specimen containers.  
 The Briggs U.S. Patent No. 4,777,964 (hereinafter the 964 
patent) discloses a blood sampling kit and a method of use which 
uses a base member and a backing to serve as a floor portion for 
blood vials. It further contains an alcohol swab, a 
finger-pricking element and clay. In addition, the 964 patent 
employs a separate masked envelope, Fig. 2, to send the samples 
safely via the postal service. From DE-A-2916564 a cradle according to the first part of the 
main claim is known. It is an object of this invention to provide a cradle which is 
usable in a postcard-type package for shipping sample containers 
via the postal service. Another object of this invention is to provide a cradle for a 
postcard-type package for shipping sample containers via the 
postal service which safely retains a fragile container while 
allowing the receiver of the postcard-type package to open the 
package and easily remove the sample container from the cradle. A further object of this invention is to provide a cradle for a 
postcard-type package for shipping sample containers which 
visibly displays the sample container when the package is sealed 
in order to maximize the sample container's visibility at the 
receiving point. The cradle
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cradle (3) for retaining a container (1) during shipping, 
said cradle comprising: 


(a) a chamber having a length and width sufficient to 
enable said container (1) to fit within said chamber 

and having a shape substantially corresponding to the 
shape of said container (1); 
(b) an open base for inserting said container (1) into said 
chamber; 
(c) a flange (13) integral to said chamber and extending 
outwardly from each side of said open base; and 
(d) one or more clasps (18), said clasps being present in a 
number sufficient to restrict said container's (1) movement 

during shipping but allow for said container's (1) 
removal after shipping, said clasps (18) being the sole 

means required for retaining said container (1) during 
shipping, 
characterized in that
 
said container is a fragile container and said clasp (18) or 

clasps (18) protrude out from the inner surface of said cradle 
and extend continously around substantially the entire inner surface 

and span across substantially the entire inner surface of 
said chamber in a widthwise direction and prevent damage to  

 
said container (1),
 
said cradle (3) being moulded from a rigid plastic material,
 
the clasp or clasps (18) being either a separate piece 

attached to, or an integral moulded part of, the inner surface 
of the cradle (3). 
The cradle as recited in claim 1, wherein at least two 
clasps are present. 
The cradle as recited in claim 2, wherein said plastic material 
is non-opaque. 
The cradle as recited in claim 3, wherein said plastic material 
is polystryrene or a polyester copolymer.
