<ABSTRACT>
A sealing arrangement for sealing to a cable or pipe comprising a hinged longitudinally slit tubular housing (14) with upstanding flanges (2) on the slit edges, sealing material within the housing, a channel shaped closure (26) for holding the upstanding flanges (20) together to close the housing (14) and a locking member (28), e.g. in the form of a screw, which in its locked position substantially prevents movement of the channel (26) relative to the housing (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sealing arrangement for sealing the 
open end of a conduit to an elongate object, such as a cable or a 
pipe that is led therethrough, and especially to a mechanical 
sealing arrangement comprising a hinged tubular housing that can 
be closed by a channel shaped closure. and which contains a sealing 
material, for example a mastic. There are many applications where it is necessary to seal the 
open end of a conduit that is to carry an elongate object. 
Environmental sealing to form a moisture and gas tight seal is 
typically required. For example, a single cable or pipe may be fed 
into a duct and a seal be required between the cable or pipe and 
the duct. Another example is provided where a plurality of cables 
are fed through individual tubular outlets into a housing, within 
which they are to be spliced to each other or to another cable. For 
example where a single large capacity communications cable is to 
be spliced to a plurality of smaller distribution cables. eg a single 
2000 pair cable to twenty 100 pair cables, the small cables are led 
into a large cylindrical housing (known as a vault closure) through 
individual tubular cable-entry-outlets projecting from the base on 
one side of the cylindrical housing and the large cable is fed into 
the other side of the cylindrical housing. Each cable must be sealed 
to its respective cable entry outlet and this presents particular 
problems for the small cables, because the cable entry outlets are 
closely spaced. A similar sealing arrangement is required in 
splicing situations where all the cables enter a housing on one side 
of the housing, eg through cable entries in a base of a dome shaped 
housing. A variety of sealing arrangements have been proposed for sealing 
the end of a conduit in the prior art. For example. for sealing 
cables entering a vault closing. the known sealing solution involves  
 
inserting the cables, then positioning heat shrinkable sleeves on 
the cable entry tubular openings, and shrinking them onto the 
cables. As well as the heat shrinkable solution described above; 
mechanical sealing arrangements are known for sealing the open 
end of a conduit. EP-A-0 440 903, DE 3739714 and DE 3863777 (WR116 DE1 and 
WR116 DE2), for example, describe a mechanical arrangement for 
sealing a cable entry to a duct. The known mechanical 
arrangement comprises a tubular housing in the form of two half 
shells which are hinged together at one side, and which are held 
together by a channel shaped member engaging
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sealing arrangement (12) for sealing the open end of a conduit (10) to an 
elongate object (36), such as a cable or pipe, that is led therethrough, the 

arrangement comprising (a) a divided tubular housing (14), that is slit 
longitudinally to form two or more half- or part-shells, and is hinged along one 

longitudinal slit to allow the housing to be opened, (b) a channel shaped 
closure member (26) which, in use, holds together upstanding flanges (20) on 

abutting edges of the slit housing to close the housing and (c) sealing material 
contained within the housing, a locking member (28) being provided within 

the channel shaped closure member, which can be moved from a first position, 
in which the channel shaped closure member can be moved along the 

upstanding flanges on the housing, to a second position in which the locking 
member firmly secures the channel shaped closure member relative to the 

flanges of the housing, the locking member comprising a screw threaded 
element which can be rotated to secure the channel shaped closure member to 

the housing flanges, characterised in that at least one of the housing flanges 
comprises threaded grooves (30) w
hich engage the turns of the screw threaded 
element when the screw threaded element is rotated. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 1, wherein the screw threaded 
element (28) extends within the channel shaped closure member (26). 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
channel shaped closure member (26) is substantially flat and projects above the 

surface of the tubular body of the housing (14) by a distance which is less than 
1/4, preferably less than 1/6, of the outer diameter of the tubular body of the 

housing. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
hinging is provided by a separate hinging element (18) which comprises a  

 
flexible strip of material extending along the outer surface of the housing over 

abutting edges of the slit housing. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 4, wherein the hinging element 
(18) comprises an apertured strip, and the tubular housing (14) is provided 

with rivet shaped stubs (48) projecting outwards from the housing and passing 
through the apertures of the strip thereby securing the strip to the housing. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 4 or claim 5, wherein the 
hinging element (18) comprises a flexible, tear-resistant polymeric material. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to any one of claims 4 to 6, wherein the 
thickness of the hinging element (18) is less than 1/10 preferably less than 1/15 

of the outer diameter of the tubular body of the housing (14). 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
upstanding flanges (20) on the housing (14) comprise cooperating features 

substantially to prevent relative axial movement between the housing parts. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to any preceding claim wherein 
retaining walls (40) are provided which span the inner diameter of the housing 

(14) on one or both sides of the sealing material, the retaining walls preferably 
being detachable. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 9, wherein the retaining walls 
(40) contain one or more openings (50) to receive the elongate objects (36) to 

be sealed. 
A sealing arrangement (12) according to claim 10, wherein the openings (50) 
are provided as indents from the edge of the retaining wall(s) (40).
