Method for preparing microcapsules of controlled sizes, in 
which a single-phase liquid crystal homogeneous lamellar phase 

is prepared, comprising at least one surfactant and at least 
one solvent and, where appropriate, a substance intended to be 

encapsulated and forming a stack of membranes, characterised 
in that this lamellar phase is subjected to constant shearing. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
solvent is water or a saline aqueous solution. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the microcapsules are liposomes. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
membranes are reverse membranes formed by water surrounded by 

surfactants in a hydrophobic solvent. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the surfactant or surfactants constitute 

from 0.5 to 50% by weight of the lamellar phase. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the shearing is between 1 and 1000 s⁻¹. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
shearing is between 2 and 400 s⁻¹. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the constant shearing is produced by 

means of a unit consisting of two concentric cylinders 
rotating constantly with respect to each other. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the constant shearing is produced by  

 
means of a unit formed by a plane/cone. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that, in the liquid crystal lamellar phase 

before shearing, there is incorporated a monomer in the 
dissolved state in one of the constituents of this lamellar 

phase, and the polymerisation of the monomer is initiated 
after the shearing. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that use is made of a lamellar phase able to 

change to the gel phase state at a lower temperature, and 
after shearing the microcapsules are taken to a temperature 

lower than the gel/liquid phase transition temperature. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the microcapsules have a diameter of 0.1 

to 10 µm.
