<ABSTRACT>
A photographic silver halide material for industrial radiography 
comprises a film support and on one or both sides thereof a silver 

halide emulsion rich in silver chloride and a silver halide emulsion 
rich in silver bromide either in admixture in the same layer or in 

contiguous layers. The ratio by weight of colloid binder, e.g. 
gelatin, to silver halide (expressed as silver nitrate) is from 3:10 

to 6:10 and the amount of silver halide corresponds to from 6 g to 
20 g of silver nitrate per square meter and per side. The material 

has been forehardened to an extent such that when it is immersed in 
demineralised water of 25°C for 3 minutes there is absorbed less 

than 2.5 g of water per gram of binder. The material can be 
processed within a total processing time of less than 5 minutes with 

a developer and fixer being substantially free from hardening agents 
and the fixer being substantially free from ammonium ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic materials for
industrial radiography for use in various processing applications.In the field of industrial radiography, especially for non-destructive
testing applications, film materials showing excellent
image quality after processing in hardener containing developer
and/or fixer solutions are well-known. The said materials are
characterised by the presence of high coated amounts of silver
bromoiodide emulsion crystals in the range of 6 to 20 grams,
expressed as the equivalent amount of silver nitrate, per square
meter and per side. Long processing times, varying between 5 and 15
minutes, are time consuming and shorter processing times are not
available without drying problems (e.g. sticking) and degeneration
of image quality (e.g. deposit on the film due to "pi-line" defects)
and sensitometry (e.g. too low contrast and/or speed).In the field of industrial radiography, and especially for nondestructive
testing applications, any time saving measure is welcome:
the tendency is to reduce the processing time to a maximum of 5
minutes and more preferably to about 2.5 minutes. In order to
achieve high film speed, which is an indispensible asset especially
for direct-X-ray applications, efficient absorption of the exposure
radiation is a prime condition. It has been shown empirically that
for X-rays the mass absorption coefficient is proportional to a
power of the atomic number Z as has been described in the "Encyclopaedic
Dictionary of Physics" vol. 7, p. 787, eq. 10,
Ed. J.Thewlis, Pergamom Press, Oxford 1957. This strongly disfavours
e.g. the use of chloride (Z=17) compared to bromide (Z=35) or iodide
(Z=54). Otherwise a cubic habit is favoured because of the volume
effect of the silver halide crystal to get good absorption properties
when exposing said crystals.Nevertheless it has been shown in EP-A-0 538 947, filed
October 24, 1991 that the object to get rapid processable industrial
radiographic films can be accomplished by a photographic silver
halide material comprising a film support and on one or both sides
thereof at least one silver halide emulsion layer which is characterised 
in that each silver halide emulsion layer comprises as silver
halide silver chloride or silver chlorobromide the amounts of
bromide being at most 25 mole %, in that it has a gelatin to silver
halide (expressed as silver nitrate) ratio by weight from 3:10 to
6:10 and an amount of silver halide corresponding to from 5 g to 15
g of silver per sq. m. and in that the photographic
