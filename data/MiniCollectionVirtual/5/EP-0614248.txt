<ABSTRACT>
An interface interconnection system for providing an 
interface to a communications network includes a wall mountable 

box (2) having cavities (12,14) and with an open front 
face and at least a partially open rear face. Edge card 

connectors (150A,150B) interconnectable with shielded or 
unshielded cable (130,120) are mounted in the wall box 

adjacent its rear face. A shielded data connector (200) is 
inserted through the front face of the box and has an edge 

card mounted thereto which is interconnected with one of the 
edge card connectors (150B). An unshielded modular jack 

(390) is also fitted with an edge card which is interconnected 
with 
the edge card connector (150A). The data connector 
and jack (200,390) are disposed adjacent the front 

face of the box for interconnection with mating shielded and 
unshielded connectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interface for 
accommodating communication network systems where more than 
one type of interface device is utilized in the same local 
area. Modular connections allow adaptation between two 
different interface devices using two different telecommunication 
cables. Communication network systems vary in scope and 
design as directed by the manufacturers of the interfacing 
devices. Some network interface devices utilize shielded 
systems whereas others utilize an unshielded system. Several 
designs of interfacing devices are known in the art. For example, US-A-4 501 459 and 4 193 654 relate to 
shielded connectors for coupling two shielded cables of a 
shielded information network system. These connectors are 
hermaphroditic in nature, that is, two identical connectors 
are utilized for the connection, and each connector can 
accommodate four lines of information. Connectors for unshielded network interfaces are 
also known, for example, US-A-4 210 376; 4 221 458; 4 292 
736 and 4 231 628 relate to data network connectors or 
modular jacks, which are mountable to printed circuit 
boards, and are capable of accommodating between four and 
eight lines of communication. These connectors include 
stamped and formed contacts for receiving a mating plug. Edge card connectors for interconnecting printed 
circuit boards to multi-conductor cable are also known in 
the art. For example, US-A-3 860 318 shows an edge 
connector having stamped and formed contacts providing 
interconnection to circuit board traces on one end, while on 
the opposite end, providing a barrel-type insulation displacement 
device for terminating individual conductors. GB-A-1 171 549 describes an adaptor for enabling a 
standard electronic module, which can be slid into racks or 
crates to form a complete system of electronic apparatus and 
which has pin contacts on the back of the module, to be 
connected to a rack or crate utilizing edge connector  
 
strips. There is disclosed in US-A-4 407 559 a local area 
network receptacle assembly for interconnection of electronic 
equipment to a local area network, including a modular 
electrical connector having at least one signal carrying 
contact disposed at a front mating face for interconnection 
with at least one mating contact of a complementary connector, 
the modular electrical connector being electrically 
connected to a shielded cable having individual data communication 
conductors which form the network, the modular 
electrical connector being
