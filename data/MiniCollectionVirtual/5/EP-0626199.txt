<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a carbon molecular sieve which 
comprises (a) treating a thermoset phenolic resin with cations of a 

metal of Group IA of the Periodic Table so as to deposit on the 
resin a total quantity of Group IA metal in the range of from 1x10⁻⁶ 

to 1x10⁻² moles per mole of carbon in the final molecular sieve 
product and subsequently (b) carbonising the thermoset phenolic 

resin by heating it to a temperature in the range of from 600 to 
1000°C while maintaining a reduced pressure over the material being 

carbonised at least while the carbon is being heated at a 
temperature above 500°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing carbon 
molecular sieves. It is known to make adsorbent carbons by various methods. Thus 
numerous methods are known for making active carbons. However many 
carbons, such as active carbons, will adsorb large amounts of 
various different materials but are not suitable for the separation 
of the components of a mixture on the basis of differences in 
molecular weight, molecular size or molecular shape. It has been proposed to modify the properties of active carbons 
derived from coal or cokes by heating the starting material in the 
presence of KOH, for example as disclosed in US 4 082 694. The 
addition of potassium ions to coal or lignite is also disclosed in 
US 4 039 473 and US 3 764 561. However active carbons made by 
heating coal or coke in the presence of KOH are not suitable for use 
as molecular sieves as they are insufficiently selective. Carbon molecular sieves are known which may be used for 
example for the separation of nitrogen and oxygen. Thus 
US 4 629 476 discloses such a carbon molecular sieve. It is made by 
starting with a coal or a carbon of vegetable origin and using a 
polymer to block macropores in the carbonaceous substrate. 
US 4 458 022 refers to the presence of alkali metal compounds in the 
context of preparing carbon molecular sieves. However the 
specification states that, in the preparation of molecular sieves 
from coconut shell, the graphitisation of the coconut shell is 
hindered by the presence of alkali metal compounds. These are  
 
therefore removed by acid washing. It is proposed in GB 1 330 296 to prepare carbon articles from 
thermoplastic alkaline phenol-aldehyde resin precursors which are 
heated to form a thermoplastic product, which is then finely 
divided, shaped, sintered, and carbonised. The production of a 
non-porous body is disclosed. Although there is a reference to 
adjusting porosity, the use of a thermoplastic resin will lead to 
the production of non-macroporous materials, which will not be 
suitable for use as molecular sieves. Japanese unexamined published specification 61-6108 discloses a 
carbon molecular sieve suitable for separating hydrocarbon isomers 
which is produced by carbonising a mixture of PVA derivatives and 
phenolic resin. The polyvinyl alcohol derivative is said to act as a pore 
former giving the micropores required for molecular sieve activity. 
The specification gives an example of a material prepared from a 
resol phenolic resin without the addition of a PVA

Group IA of the Periodic Table so as to deposit on the resin a total 

quantity of Group IA metal in the range of from 1 x 10⁻⁶ to 1 x 10⁻²
