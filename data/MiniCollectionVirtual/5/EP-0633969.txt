<ABSTRACT>
A jetting head for cleaning a sewer has an inlet (C) for connection to a pipe (2) carrying water. The body (1) of the head is arranged to lie generally horizontally in the sewer and includes an outlet (0) arranged to direct a jet of water downwards at a shallow angle ( alpha ) to the longitudinal axis of the body (1). The jet strikes the detritus (8) in the invert of the sewer at a shallow angle ( alpha ) of attack. In one example, the head includes a nozzle (12) connected to the outlet (0) and producing a single fan-shaped jet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a head for use in
cleaning sewers, of the type known as a "jetting head".The use of a jetting head, as disclosed by GB-A-1,046,829, is one of a number of
techniques which have been adopted for cleaning sewers to
remove sediment and detrital matter. A hose is fed down
the sewer and water is jetted at high velocity from a
nozzle on the end of the pipe. Initially, the jetting of
the water serves to propel the head along the sewer a
certain distance. Subsequently, the head is winched back,
and as it progresses along the sewer the jets of water from
the head strike and dislodge some of the detritus and other
material in the sewer. The dislodged material is then
carried away by water pressure from the jet flowing
downstream and typically is extracted by a suction unit
operating in conjunction with the cleaning head.Although the use of jetting heads offers advantages
over some other methods of sewer cleaning, it is still a
relatively expensive procedure both in terms of the capital
cost of the jetting equipment and also in terms of the
manpower required to carry out the operation. Accordingly
it is important that the jetting operation should be as
efficient as possible.According to the present invention, there is provided
a jetting head for use in cleaning a sewer comprising a
body including an inlet for connection to a pipe carrying
water, and an outlet for a jet of water, characterised in
that the body is arranged to lie generally horizontally in
the invert of the sewer and includes a single main outlet only, the outlet being arranged to
direct a single spread far-shaped jet of water downwards at a shallow angle to the 
longitudinal axis of the body, in use the jet striking
detritus in the invert at a shallow angle of attack.Preferably the outlet directs the jet at an angle of
less than 25° to the longitudinal axis of the head, and
more preferably less than 10°. Preferably the jet is
directed at an angle of substantially 5°.The present inventor has recognised that a very marked
improvement in the performance of the jetting head can be
realised by directing the jet at a far shallower angle so
that it is almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
sewer. The jet is then effective to sweep downstream the
detritus from the point at which the jet impacts. Any
detrital material overlying the point of impact then in
turn falls downwards, is struck by the jet and is also
swept downstream. Functioning in this manner, the head can
clear a sewer at a far greater rate than has

A jetting head for use in cleaning a sewer comprising
a body (1) including an inlet (C) for connection to a pipe

carrying water, and an outlet for a jet of water,
characterised in that the body is arranged to lie generally

horizontally in the invert of the sewer and includes a
single main outlet (O) only, the outlet being arranged to

direct a single spread fan-shaped jet of water downwards at
a shallow angle (α) to the longitudinal axis of the body,

in use the jet striking detritus (8) in the invert at a
shallow angle of attack.
A head according to claim 1, in which the main outlet
(O) includes a nozzle (12) arranged to direct and spread

the jet of water.
A head according to claim 2, in which the nozzle (12)
is generally frusto-conical in plan section.
A head according to any one of the preceding claims,
in which the outlet (O) directs the jet at an angle of less

than 25° and preferably less than 10° to the longitudinal
axis of the head.
A head according to claim 4, in which the jet is
directed at an angle of substantially 5°.
A head according to any one of the preceding claims,
in which the body comprises a hollow chamber, the inlet (C)

being formed in one end wall of the chamber and the outlet
(O) being formed in a bottom wall of the chamber.
A head according to claim 6, in which the hollow
chamber is arranged so that water flowing into the chamber

from the inlet (C) is turned back at a turbulent boundary
associated with an opposing end wall of the chamber before

exiting the chamber through the outlet.
A head according to claim 7, including an upstanding
block formed on the bottom wall of the chamber adjacent the

outlet and extending upwards for part only of the height of
the chamber, the upstanding member being formed on the side 

of the outlet nearer the inlet and serving to increase the
velocity of water flowing into the outlet.
A head according to any one of claims 6 to 8 when
directly or indirectly dependent on claim 2, in which the

nozzle is formed as a channel underlying the chamber and
extending downwardly from the outlet at a shallow angle,

the far end of the channel being open to direct the jet of
water at the invert.
A head according to any one of the preceding claims,
further comprising one or more longitudinal support members

underlying the head and serving in use to raise the outlet
above the bottom of the invert so that the jet strikes the

detritus in a region distanced from the head.
A head according to any one of the preceding claims,
further comprising a prow formed on the end of the head

away from the inlet and arranged to facilitate the movement
of the head through the detritus in the sewer.
A method of cleaning a sewer characterised by
directing a single spread fan-shaped jet only from a

jetting head at a layer of detritus in the invert of the
sewer at a shallow angle from a position such that the jet

impacts upon the detritus in a region below the top of the
layer.
