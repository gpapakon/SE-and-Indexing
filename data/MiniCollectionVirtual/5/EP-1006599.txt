<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing an electrode (40) for a battery comprises the steps of
continuously forming a metallic porous foil (10) consisting of metal powder having

fine voids; attaching to said foil a powder of an active substance (20) not
containing a binder, fixing the activ substance in the fine voids and to the surface

of the foil under pressure by passing the foil through rollers (6), forming a
binder coating
 layer on surfaces of the powder layer by introducing the foil into
a tank (26) containig liquid binder (25), drying the binder coating layer, and setting

the thickness of the foil (10) by passing it through pressure rollers (30, 31,
32, 33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing an electrode for a battery 
and an electrode produced by this method. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a method of forming a metallic porous foil from metal powder and 
filling powder of an active substance into a void of the metallic porous foil and 
fixing it to a surface of a sheet of the metallic porous foil. The method is preferably 
used to produce a negative electrode of a nickel hydrogen battery. In addition, 
the method is preferably used to produce a positive electrode of the nickel 
hydrogen battery, and further an electrode of various kinds of batteries such as 
a nickel cadmium battery, a lithium primary battery, a lithium secondary battery, 
an alkaline dry cell, a fuel cell, and a battery for a vehicle. EP-A-0 864 389, in the name of the present inventor, discloses a method for manufacturing 
porous sheet, porous metal sheet manufactured by this method, and an electrode 
for a battery. Metal powders are spread on a feeding belt or a supporting sheet 
which is continuously fed, the feeding belt or the supporting sheet on which the metal 
powders have been spread is passed through a sintering oven, and the metal powders 
are sintered, with adjacent uncompressed metal powders in contact with each other 
partly and gaps present therebetween. Consequently, contact portions of the metal 
powders are integrated with each other and the gaps are formed as fine pores. Conventionally, a negative electrode of the nickel hydrogen battery is produced 
as follows: Hydrogen-storing alloy powders are kneaded with binder (binding 
agent), carbon (electrically conductive material), and the like to obtain a pasty 
active substance. Then, the pasty active substance is filled into three-dimensional 
pores of a three-dimensional metallic porous plate such as a foamed 
sheet-shaped metallic porous plate or a nonwoven fabric-like metallic porous 
plate used as a base material of an electrode; or the pasty active substance is 
applied to a metallic porous plate produced by forming pores in a metallic plate 
such as a punching metal, a lath, and the like. Finally, the metallic porous plate 
is passed between a pair of pressure rollers to pressurize it one to four times after 
the pasty active substance is dried, then the electrode is produced. However, when the metallic porous plate having the three-dimensional pores is 
pressurized after the pasty active substance is applied thereto, a skeleton surrounding 
the three-dimensional pores is
