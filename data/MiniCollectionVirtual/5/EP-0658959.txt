<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector for being electrically coupled to at 
least one electrical conductor. The connector includes a 

housing and at least one contact positioned therein and 
including a tip portion which protrudes from the housing to 

engage the conductor. Significantly, the contact, initially 
of a non-stressed configuration, is preloaded within the 

housing to assume a curved configuration and to engage the 
respective conductor in such a manner that sound, positive 

engagement occurs in a substantially non-wiping manner. The 
housing may thus be stationarily positioned relative to the 

circuit member, the circuit member able to thus press against 
the tip portion of the contact to complete coupling. The 

remaining part of the invention may be electrically coupled to 
an external conductor, e.g., a cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electrical connectors and 
particularly to such connectors for use in information 
handling systems (computers). As is understood, several types of electrical connectors are 
known in the art. In US Patent 3,961,834 (Venaleck), there is 
described a bow contact for being slidably engaged along a 
bowed, side surface thereof by a conductor, e.g., connector 
pin. Such engagement serves to compress the preformed bowed 
configuration. In US Patent 4,526,436 (Aso), there is 
described an electrical connector for connecting to a 
flexible, multi-connector cable when the cable is inserted 
therein. In US Patent 4,734,053 (Imai), another type of flat cable 
connector is disclosed, this connector using two housing parts 
which mate together to compress the cable. In US Patent 
4,871,315 (Noschese), there is described yet another cable 
connector, this for what is defined as a ribbon cable, the 
cable of different layers each of which is associated with a 
respective subassembly (cable holder lock). US Patent 
4,948,379 (Evans) describes yet another version of a connector 
for connecting what are referred to as circuit-bearing 
substrates positioned therein, the connections being made to 
respective contacts located within the connector's housing. 
US Patents 5,106,311 (Yodogawa et al.), 5,181,854 (Masuda) and 
5,199,882 (Bates et al.) all describe various types of 
electrical connectors for having flexible or the like cables 
positioned therein to effect contact therewith in a  
 
predetermined manner. In US Patent 5,215,471 (Raymond et 
al.), an electrical connector is described wherein tapered 
plugs or the like are individually positioned within 
respective receiving portions of the connector's housing. In US Patent 5,237,743 (Busacco et al.), there is defined a 
method of forming a conductive end portion on a flexible 
circuit member for use in an electrical connector, wherein the 
end portion is adaptive for including dendritic conductive 
elements (e.g., palladium) on a protruding edge thereof for 
electrically connecting to associated conductor members (e.g., 
pads on a printed circuit board or electronic module). As 
defined in 5,237,743, the preferred method for providing these 
dendritic elements is electroplating, which may be provided in 
accordance with the procedure defined in Canadian patent 
1,121,011. Still another process is defined in US Patent 
5,185,073 (Bindra et al.). US Patents 5,185,073 and 
5,237,743, in addition to Canadian patent 1,121,011, are all 
assigned

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector for being electrically coupled to 
at least one electrical conductor, said connector 

comprising: 
a housing defining a chamber therein; 

at least one electrical contact positioned within said 
housing and including a tip portion protruding from said 

housing and adapted for engaging said electrical 
conductor with a predetermined force, said contact having 

an initial overall first length and corresponding first 
width prior to being positioned within said housing, said 

housing engaging said contact at three spaced locations 
on said contact so as to preload said contact within said 

housing such that said contact will possess a second 
length and corresponding second width, said second width 

greater than said first width and of an established, 
relatively small percentage of said overall first length, 

said housing being disengaged from said contact at one of 
said three spaced locations when said tip portion engages 

said electrical conductor to thereby substantially 

prevent a sliding type of engagement between said tip 
portion and said conductor. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said relatively small 
percentage is within the range of from about 3.5 percent 

to about 13.0 percent. 
The connector of claim 2 wherein said relatively small 
percentage is about seven percent. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said second length of 
said contact is less that said first length by an 

established percentage when said housing engages said 
contact at said three locations so as to preload said 

contact within said housing. 
The connector of claim 4 wherein said established 
percentage is within the range of about 0.4 percent to 

about 5.4 percent. 
The connector of claim 5 wherein said established 
percentage is about 1.8 percent. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said contact possesses a 
substantially bowed configuration when engaged by said 

housing at said three locations. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein one of said spaced 
locations of said contact engaged by said housing is 

substantially adjacent said tip portion. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said first length is the 
free length. 
The connector of claim 1 further including an electrical 
cable, said contact being electrically coupled to said 

cable. 
The connector of claim 1 wherein said tip portion of said 
contact includes a plurality of dendritic contacting 

elements thereon, said dendritic contacting elements 
adapted for engaging said electrical conductor to provide 

said electrical coupling. 
An information handling system comprising: 
a circuitized substrate including at least one electrical 

conductor; and 
an electrical connector for being electrically coupled to 

said electrical conductor, said connector including a 
housing defining a chamber therein, at least one 

electrical contact positioned within said housing and 
including a tip portion protruding from said housing and 

 
adapted for engaging said electrical conductor with a 

predetermined force, said contact having an initial 
overall first length and corresponding first width prior 

to being positioned within said housing, said housing 
engaging said contact at three spaced locations on said 

contact so as to preload said contact within said housing 
such that said contact will possess a second length and 

corresponding second width, said second width greater 
than said first width and of an established, relatively 

small percentage of said overall first length, said 
housing being disengaged from said contact at one of said 

three spaced locations when said tip portion engages said 
electrical conductor to thereby substantially prevent a 

sliding type of engagement between said tip portion and 
said conductor.
