<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic carrier for use in a developer for 
developing latent electrostatic images is composed of 

magnetic carrier particles with a particle size of 35 µm 
or less in an amount of 15 wt.% or more, and a developer 

is composed of the above carrier and a toner. An image 
formation method is composed of the steps of (a) 

uniformly charging the surface of a photoconductor to a 
predetermined polarity, (b) forming latent electrostatic 

images including low potential portions and high 
potential portions on the photoconductor by subjecting 

the charged surface of the photoconductor to selective 
light radiation corresponding to light images, thereby 

selectively reducing the potential of the surface of the 
photoconductor, and (c) developing the thus formed latent 

electrostatic images to visible toner images by bringing 
the developer into contact with the latent-electrostatic-images-bearing 

photoconductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier, a
developer, and an electrophotographic photoconductor for
use in electrophotography, and to an electrophotographic
image formation method capable of forming images on an
electrophotographic photoconductor with a relatively low
charging potential by the application of a low developing
bias voltage thereto.Since the invention of electrophotography by C. F.
Carlson an disclosed as a Carlson process in U.S. Patent
No. 2,297,691, various improvements have been proposed
based on the Carlson process.Electrophotography, a representative example of
which is the Carlson process, is currently widely used.
The basic process of electrophotography comprises the
steps of uniformly charging the surface of a photoconductor,
selectively exposing the uniformly charged
surface of the photoconductor to a light image, thereby
forming a latent electrostatic image corresponding to the 
light image on the surface of the photoconductor,
developing the latent electrostatic image to a visible
toner image by a developer, transferring the toner image
from the surface of the photoconductor to an image
receiving medium, and fixing the toner image on the image
receiving medium.Conventional main methods for developing electrostatic
latent images are a two-component development
method using a two-component developer comprising a
carrier and a toner, and a one-component jumping
development method using a one-component developer.
comprising one component. For example, in the case of a
conventional two-component developer comprising a toner
and an electrically-insulating carrier such as a resin-coated
ferrite, a carrier with an average particle size
of about 80 µm is used as the electrically-insulating
carrier, and the concentration of the toner in the
developer is set in the range from about 3 to 5 wt.%.In the development step of the above-mentioned
conventional development methods, a toner which is a
colored resin powder is caused to be selectively
deposited in a development area of the surface of a
photoconductor in which latent electrostatic images to be
developed are formed. On the other hand, in a non-development
area of the surface of the photoconductor, 
the toner is caused not to be deposited. In order to
carry out the above-mentioned development, it is required
that the amount of magnetic particles contained in the
toner be appropriately adjusted, or the surface potential
of the photoconductor be set at about 500 V or more in
the charging step, the potential difference between a
high
