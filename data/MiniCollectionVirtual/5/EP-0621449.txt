<ABSTRACT>
The method is characterised in that the combustion grate is temperature-controlled by a medium flowing through it. Furthermore, primary air is supplied through a large number of continuous holes (8) in the combustion grate, the primary air supply being individually dosed for each hole (8). The grate plate (1) is characterised in that it has externally in general the shape of a board, and its length is intended to extend over the entire width of the combustion grate to be produced or of a grate web to be produced and thus form a complete grate step. This grate plate (1) is made from sheet metal and is hollow on the inside. Distributed over its surface (2), it has some encased holes (8) or slots which run through the grate plate (1) and the hole opening (8) of which is smaller on the grate-plate upper side (2) than on the grate-plate lower side (3). On one side of the grate plate (1), there is a connection pipe piece (6) and on the other side a removal pipe piece (7) for a medium which is to flow through it. The combustion grate consists of a large number of such grate plates (1), these grate plates (1) extending with an inclined wide side in their longitudinal direction over the entire width of the combustion grate and in each case forming a complete grate step. Each grate plate (1) overlaps and rests on the next grate plate (1) in the conveying direction of the material being combusted.

Combustion grate for the combustion of refuse consisting of a plurality of
grate stages which move in relation to each other, consisting of a plurality of

grate plates (14-17) which outwardly generally have the shape of a board,
are made of sheet metal and form a hollow element with an upperside and

an underside (2,3) and on one side of the underside (3) have at least one
pipe connection (6) and on the other side of the underside (3) have at least

one discharge pipe connection (7) for the supply and discharge of a liquid
medium to flow through them to temper them, whereby these grate plates

(14-17) extending in their longitudinal direction over the entire width of the
combustion grate, thus each forming a full grate stage, whereby this grate

stage overlaps and rests on the next neighbouring grate stage in or counter
to the transportation direction of the grate.
The combustion grate of claim 1, characterized in that every second grate
plate (16,17) is connected to a mechanical drive by means of which it can be

moved to and fro relative to the stationary grate plates (14,15) of the
neighbouring grate stages to generate a scraping stroke in the downward

line of its inclination.
The combustion grate of claim 2, characterized in that the combustion grate
is a reverse feed type grate or a forward feed type grate and is horizontally,

upwardly or downwardly inclined relative to the transportation direction of the
combustion material.
The combustion grate of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the tubes
which pass through it for supplying primary air and which open out

underneath the combustion grate are connected underneath the grate to
supply air siphons (30), through which the primary air can be pumped to the

grate, and in that at the bottom of each of these siphons (30) there is a flap 
(31) which can be operated by remote control by means of a solenoid (37) to

discharge the material (40) that falls through the grate into them.
The combustion grate of one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the grate
plates (1) are mounted to the sides on planks (54) through the inside of

which a cooling medium can flow.
A method for the combustion of refuse on a combustion grate through the
inside of which flows a liquid which tempers the combustion grate, and which

is pierced by a plurality of holes formed by sections of tubes which pass
through it, through which air is supplied to the fire from underneath the

combustion grate, characterized in that the refuse is combusted on a thrust
combustion grate consisting of several grate stages executing scraper

movements relative to each other, made up of hollow grate plates (1;14-17)
through which a liquid flows and which extend over the entire width of the

grate, and in that the primary air supplied to each hole (8) is individually
dosed.
The method of claim 6, characterized in that the primary air supply is
controlled via a microprocessor which controls the air supply to each

individual hole (8) in the combustion grate depending on the temperature
detected in the region of the particular hole (8) in such a manner that the

combustion chamber temperature spectrum comes close to a presettable
temperature spectrum.
The method of one of claims 6 to 7, characterized in that the tempering
medium is in heat exchange via a heat exchanger with the supply of primary

air and/or with the exhaust combustion air.
