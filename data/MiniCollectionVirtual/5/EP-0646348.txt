<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to ultrasonic 
intravascular imaging devices -- i.e., devices of 
the type which utilize acoustic transducers 
operating at ultrasonic frequencies to image 
intravascular geometry and/or associated tissue 
characteristics. In a specific embodiment it 
includes an elongate probe guide assembly, an 
ultrasonic transducer fixed to the probe guide 
assembly's distal end, and electrical cabling housed 
within, and extending proximally of, the probe guide 
assembly so as to send/receive electrical signals 
to/from the transducer. This invention effectively reduces "dead space" 
radially of the probe otherwise obscuring nearby 
reflections during the normal "ring down" time of a 
piezoelectric transceiver/transducer immediately 
after a transmit operation. A reflector is distally 
spaced from the transducer so as to reflect the 
ultrasound waves between a first path which is 
substantially parallel to the probe axis and a 
second path which is substantially perpendicular 
(i.e., radial) to the probe axis. A tuning 
induction coil is electrically connected in series 
with the transducer and is coaxially positioned 
within the tube section closely adjacent to the 
transducer. Such structure permits the ultrasound 
probes of this invention to be sufficiently  
 
miniaturized to be useful in extremely near-field 
intravascular imaging procedures. Intravascular probes which include ultrasound 
imaging crystal arrays have been proposed in the 
past. It is known, for example, to mount a 
piezoelectric crystal element (conventionally termed 
a "transducer") on or within a catheter of the type 
which can be inserted into a blood vessel. Once the 
probe has been inserted into a blood vessel, the 
transducer is electro-mechanically excited (as by 
the application of an electrical signal) to cause 
emission of ultrasonic energy into the surrounding 
tissue. While much of the emitted energy is 
absorbed by the surrounding tissue, a sufficient 
amount of energy is reflected back toward the 
transducer to permit imaging (with reflection 
occurring principally at interfaces between 
different types of material, e.g., the interface 
between blood and the vascular wall, the interface 
between blood and lesions adhered to the vascular 
wall, etcetera). The transducer, in turn, produces weak 
electrical signals in response to electro mechanical 
excitation by the returning reflected ("echo") 
ultrasonic energy. These weak electrical signals 
can be used to determine the geometry and/or other 
chara
