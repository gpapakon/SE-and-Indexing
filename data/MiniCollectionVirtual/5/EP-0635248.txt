<ABSTRACT>
To obtain a disposable diaper having at its respective 
waist sides welded zones which provide smooth touch, herein 

disclosed a method for making a disposable diaper 1 
comprising steps of putting wing-like portions 21, 22 

provided on front and rear bodies 5, 6 of the diaper 1 one 
upon another with a topsheet 2 facing inward, and welding 

these wing-like portions together under heat and pressure. 
In each wing-like portion 21, 22, a piece of sheet member is 

attached to at least one of the top- and backsheets 2, 3 so as 
to form an extension thereof and provide thereby the 

backsheet of said portion having a melting point higher than 
a melting point of the topside sheet member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a 
disposable diaper with each of laterally opposite sides of a 
waist being welded. One example of a pant type of disposable diapers is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. 
JP-A-50-15551 & (EP-A-0 531 666), according to which a diaper comprising a topsheet, a 
backsheet, and a liquid-absorbent core sandwiched 
therebetween is folded up along a transverse center line 
passing through a crotch zone to lay front and rear bodies one 
upon another, and the top- and backsheets are ultrasonically 
welded together along laterally opposite side edges at its 
waist level to obtain a pant type configuration. The top- and 
backsheets may be prepared, for example, from nonwoven fabric 
of thermoplastic synthetic resin, both of which sheets can be 
molten together by ultrasonic treatment. If the same kinds of nonwoven fabrics are used for the 
top- and backsheets in said Disclosure and molten at the same 
temperature to exhibit viscosities appropriate for welding, 
the welded top- and backsheets at the temperature may present 
a smoothly finished appearance. However, if the topsheet  
 
prepared from nonwoven fabric of polypropylene having a 
relatively high melting point is attached to the backsheet 
prepared from a polyethylene sheet having a relatively low 
melting point, the backsheet is molten earlier than the 
topsheet when the basic diaper is folded up like the joined 
hands and subjected to an ultrasonic welder. In consequence, 
the polyethylene of the backsheet may be molten to an 
excessively low viscosity and stick to a horn which has been 
pressed against the backsheet. The polyethylene sheet which 
has once sticked to the horn has, after cooled, a roughened 
surface giving a wearer of the diaper skin itchy stimulus as 
well as uncomfortable feel and a bad aesthetic appearance of 
the diaper. If a bit of the polyethylene sheet remains 
sticking to the horn, no accurate clearance can be assured 
between the horn and the anvil of the welder during the next 
welding cycle, making a continuous welding difficult. Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention 
to solve problems accompanying said prior art by preparing a 
backsheet in diaper's wing-like portions from a sheet having 
a melting point higher than a melting point of a topsheet 
thereof. The object set forth above is achieved, according to the 
invention, by a method for making a disposable diaper 
generally comprising steps of assembling a liquid-permeable 
topsheet,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for making a disposable diaper generally 
comprising steps of assembling a liquid-permeable topsheet (2), 

a liquid-impermeable backsheet (3) and a liquid-absorbent core (4) 
sandwiched between these sheets into a configuration of 

disposable diaper (1), putting wing-like portions (21, 22) of front and 
rear bodies (5, 6) of the diaper outwardly extending from laterally 

opposite side edges of said core one upon another and welding 
said wing-like portions (21, 22) together under heat and pressure to 

form laterally opposite side portions at waist levels of said 
front and rear bodies, said method further comprising steps 

of:
 
   attaching a sheet (2A, 3A) to at least one of top- and backsheets (2, 3) 

in each wing-like portion so as to form an extension thereof 
and provide thereby the backsheet (3A) of said portion having a 

melting point higher than a melting point of the topsheet (2A) of 
said portion, and welding said top- and backsheets together 

along each waist side of the diaper. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the topsheet (2) has a 
melting point higher than that of the backsheet (3), a sheet (2A) 

which is attached to said topsheet (2) in said wing-like portion (21, 22) 
having a melting point lower than that of said backsheet (3). 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the topsheet (2) has a  
 

melting point higher than that of the backsheet (3), a sheet (3A) 
which is attached to said backsheet (3) in said wing-like portion (21, 22) 

having a melting point higher than that of said topsheet (2).
