<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for separating off organic components from exhaust air, in a first separation stage (1), the exhaust air being brought into contact with a high-boiling scrubbing oil (I) and the scrubbing oil (I) laden with organic components being regenerated, in a second separation stage (2) the exhaust gas stream of the first separation stage being brought into contact with a further scrubbing oil (II) and ejected from the process. The invention permits the use in the second separation stage (2) of less physicochemically stable scrubbing oils (II), for example vegetable oils, which are generally significantly less expensive than conventional synthetic scrubbing oils (I) which are used in the first absorption stage.
