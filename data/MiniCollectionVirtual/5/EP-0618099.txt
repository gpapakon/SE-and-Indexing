<ABSTRACT>
A rear window structure with an alarm lamp for a 
vehicle has a gasket (3) to be attached to a rear frame in a 

vehicle body, a rear window glass sheet (1), and a holder (4) 
provided with a glass sheet fitting portion and an alarm 

lamp holding portion, wherein the holder is provided 
between the gasket (3) and a peripheral edge portion of the 

glass sheet; the holder (4) is firmly secured by fitting the 
glass sheet to the glass sheet fitting portion; the alarm 

lamp holding portion opens to the backward of the vehicle 
body; and an alarm lamp is held by the alarm lamp holding 

portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rear window 
structure with an alarm lamp wherein a holding member 
holding an alarm lamp is interposed between a gasket 
attached to a rear frame of a vehicle body and a 
peripheral portion of a rear window glass sheet. As an alarm lamp for a vehicle, in particular, for an 
automobile, there are a stop lamp, a direction indicator 
and so on for informing information to the rear side. As 
the stop lamp, a pair of stop lamps are usually provided 
at right and left sides of the tail portion of a vehicle. 
Further, in order to make the recognition of the stop, 
the deceleration or the like of a vehicle easy to a 
driver in a succeeding vehicle during driving, it has 
been known to mount a stop lamp or stop lamps at a lower 
portion or an upper portion of a rear window of the 
vehicle. Further, it has been known to mount a stop lamp 
on the surface of a rear portion of the cover of the rear 
trunk, i.e. a trunk lid. Such a style of mounting is  
 
referred to as a high mount stop lamp (HMSL), which is 
commercially available. In the HMSL in a style wherein a stop lamp is located 
at a lower portion or an upper portion of the rear 
window, there has been known to attach the shop lamp at 
the cabin side with respect to the rear window, namely, 
at the inside of the vehicle as proposed in, for 
instance, USP 4,993,774. When the lamp is attached to the cabin side of the 
rear window, the attachment or removal of the stop lamp 
has to be conducted in a narrow space in the vehicle. 
Further, since the lamp has a certain volume, and there 
is an upper limit on the position of the lamp because of 
the rear edge portion of the vehicle roof, an effective 
space of the interior of the vehicle is narrow, and an 
eyesight to the backward and a view in the cabin are 
poor. Further, when the stop lamp is located at the 
cabin side, a light emitted from the lamp is caused to 
pass through the glass sheet of the rear window. 
Accordingly, the luminous intensity of the lamp has to be 
compensated because the effective luminous intensity is 
largely reduced. Further a large current is needed at the time of 
turning on and off the lamp. In particular, the stop 
lamp and the direction indicator are frequently turned-on 
and off in the driving. Accordingly, a battery having a 
large capacity had to be provided, and power consumption  
 
of the battery is not negligible. In a style wherein the stop lamp is mounted on the 
surface of the rear portion of the trunk lid, namely, the 
lamp is mounted
