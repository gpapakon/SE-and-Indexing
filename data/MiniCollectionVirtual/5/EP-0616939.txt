<ABSTRACT>
In a fifth-wheel saddle plate with an insertion slot (2) for a fifth-wheel king pin and an anti-wear ring (3) which is mounted in a countersunk portion (4) of the insertion slot (2), is approximately horseshoe-shaped and consists of a plastic which is capable of sliding in relation to the fifth-wheel king pin, the anti-wear ring (3) protrudes radially inwards over the edge of the insertion slot (2) and its radially inner contour (5) is at least partially semicircular. In order largely to avoid deformation of the anti-wear ring by axial mounting forces and rotational forces acting on it through the fifth-wheel king pin, it is ensured that the anti-wear ring (3) is secured in the countersunk portion (4) by means of a metal holding plate (6) which partially engages over the anti-wear ring (3) and is mounted radially outside the anti-wear ring (3) on the fifth-wheel saddle plate (1), and that the radially outer contour (7) of the anti-wear ring (3) and the contour of the surface (8), resting on that contour (7), of the countersunk portion (4) are eccentric with respect to the centre point of the semicircle of the radially inner contour (5) of the anti-wear ring (3).

Semitrailer coupling plate with an introduction slot (2) for a 
traction saddle spigot and an about horseshoe-shaped replaceable ring 

(3), which is fastened in a stepped portion (4) of the introduction 
slot (2), is of a synthetic material slidable relative to the 

traction saddle spigot, projects radially inwards beyond the rim of 
the introduction slot (2) and the radially inward outline (5) of 

which is at least partially semicircular, characterised thereby, that 
the replaceable ring (3) is retained by means of a retaining plate 

(6) of metal, which partially engages over the replaceable ring (3) 
and is fastened at the semitrailer coupling plate (1) radially 

outward of the replaceable ring (3), in the stepped portion (4) and 
the radially outward outline (7) of the replaceable ring (3) as well 

as the outline of that surface (8) of the stepped portion (4), which 
lies against that outline (7), are eccentric with respect to the 

centre (M‚ÇÅ) of the semicircle of the radially inward outline (5) of 
the replaceable ring (3). 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that the radially outward outline (7) of the replaceable 

ring (3) and the outline of that surface (8) of the stepped portion 
(4), which lies against that outline (7), are of circularly arcuate 

shape. 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised thereby, that the retaining plate (6) is fastened by 

means of screws in the stepped portion (4). 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby, that the retaining plate (6) is about 

horseshoe-shaped. 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised thereby, that the replaceable ring (3) displays a 

projection (15), which protrudes axially upwards and engages with a  
 

fit into a radial depression (16) on the radially inward side of the 
retaining plate (6). 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised thereby, that the replaceable ring (3) bears on a 

radially inwardly projecting flange (17), which displays an axially 
downwardly protruding projection (17b), of the stepped portion (4). 
Semitrailer coupling plate according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised thereby, that an axial play is provided between the 

replaceable ring (3) and that part of the retaining plate (6), which 
engages over the replaceable ring (3).
