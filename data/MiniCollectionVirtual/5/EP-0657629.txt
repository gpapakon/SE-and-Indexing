<ABSTRACT>
So that on the one hand a secure fixing of a propeller on the valve stem of an inlet and exhaust valve is ensured even under extremely high loads and that, on the other hand, account is taken of differing requirements for different valve parts by means of a deliberate choice of materials, the valve stem 2 together with the propeller 3 is manufactured from a common blank by turning the propeller 3 in the form of its radial generating curve from the said blank in order to obtain the valve stem 2, and milling the vanes 6 out of the turned form of the propeller 3. The valve disc 4 is manufactured from a high temperature-resistant material, whilst the valve stem 2 together with the propeller 3 is composed of a material with low notch sensitivity and high fatigue strength. The valve disc 4 is connected to the valve stem 2 by a friction weld.

<CLAIMS>
Gas change-over valve, in particular an exhaust
valve of an internal combustion engine having a rotary

device in the form of a propeller arranged on the valve
shaft, at least the valve shaft (2) together with the

propeller (3) being produced from a common blank, 
characterised in that

the propeller (3) is turned in the form of its radial
envelope curve from this blank for the valve shaft (2),

and the blades (6) are machined by means of milling
from the rotary form of the propeller (3), and in that

the valve disc (4) is produced from a high temperature
resistant material, and the valve shaft (2) together

with the propeller (3) is made of a material with low
susceptibility to notch impacts and high durability.
Gas change-over valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the valve disc (4) is forged onto
the valve shaft (2) with the propeller (3).
Gas change-over valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the valve disc (4) is made of a
typical valve steel.
Gas change-over valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the valve disc (4) is made of a
super alloy, in particular NiCr 30 TiAl.
Gas change-over valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the valve shaft (2) together with
the propeller (3) is made of a hot-worked steel, in

particular X 38 CrMo V 5.1V.
Gas change-over valve according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the valve disc (4) is connected
to the valve shaft (2) by a friction weld (7).
