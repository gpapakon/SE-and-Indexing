<ABSTRACT>
In an electric motor the shaft (2) projects beyond the bearing (6) on the closed-end and has a central drilling (13) running from this side to close to the drive-end bearing (5). Centrally in the drilling (13) is secured a tube (7) which either extends to close to the end of the drilling or is secured in a blind hole (14) in the end of the drilling. The tube (7) has a lateral drilling (15) in the region of the base of the drilling. At the end of the shaft (2) near the closed-end bearing (6) outside the motor housing, a device (9) is secured to the end-plate (3) via which water used as a coolant passes into the tube (7) and flows back via the space between the tube (7) and the drilling (13). The tube (7) is held centrally in the drilling (13) by two discs (8, 16) with axial holes (17) slid over the tube (7). This construction makes it possible to conduct the heat dissipated in the rotor winding and the rotor, which is transmitted to the shaft, away in the best possible way.

Electrical machine, constituted of a stator, a rotating 
shaft (2), with a rotor (1) fixed rigidly on this shaft and a 

crankcase (1) in which the stator is fixed and the crankcase 
presenting on either side a bearing shild (3, 4), in each of 

which is fixed a rolling bearing (5, 6), by the intermediary 
of which journals the shaft (2) which is provided an end of 

shaft and that emerges the bearing (6) situated on the 
exploitation side and presents a bore (13) centered in which 

is fixed centrally a tube (7) and the extremity of the shaft 
(2), for the bearing (6) situated the exploitation side, is 

provided outside of the machine crankcase a device (9), fixed 
on the bearing shild (3), and through which a coolant fluid, 

preferably water, arrives in the tube (7) and returns by 
passing by the space constituted between the tube (7) and the 

bore (13), characterized in that the central bore (13) spared 
in the shaft (2) of the bearing (6) situated ond the 

exploitation side arrives close to the bearing (1) situated 
on the driving side, and in that the tube (7) is fixed in an 

blind hole (14) spared to the bottom of the bore (13), the 
tube (7) presenting in the zone of the bottom of the bore 

(13) at least a lateral bore (15). 
Electrical machine according to the claim 1, 
characterized in that the tube (7) is fixed centrally in the 

bore (13) by mean of at least two discs (8, 16) threaded from 
a distance on the tube (7) and presenting axial holes (17).
