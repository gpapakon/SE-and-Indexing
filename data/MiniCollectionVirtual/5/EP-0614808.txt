<ABSTRACT>
A thermal protection element comprising a shell-shaped hollow rigid panel made of a thermostructural composite including a fibrous reinforcement densified by a matrix, and a thermal insulant filling the panel, is obtained by making a rigid block (20) of low-density thermally insulating material, the block having an external surface whose shape corresponds to that of the internal surface of the panel, while forming over the block of insulating material a fibrous preform (11) constituting the reinforcement of the composite, and by densifying the fibrous preform using the material constituting the matrix of the composite.

A method of manufacturing a thermal shielding element 
comprising a hollow rigid panel in the form of a shell made of a 

thermostructural composite material comprising a fiber reinforcement 
densified by a matrix, and a thermal insulant filling the panel, which method 

is characterized in that it comprises the following steps: 


making a rigid block of thermally insulating material of low 
density, the block having an outside surface whose shape corresponds to 

an inside surface of the panel; and 
making the panel of thermostructural composite material 
directly on the block. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that the panel 
of thermostructural composite material is made by applying the following 

steps: 

a fiber preform constituting the reinforcement of the composite 
material is formed on the block of insulating material; and 
the fiber preform is densified with the material that constitutes 
the matrix of the composite material. 
The method according to claim 2, characterized in that the fiber 
preform is densified while maintaining the preform in a shape that 

corresponds to the shape of the panel to be made. 
The method according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
preform is held between the block of thermal insulant and a complementary 

tooling element. 
The method according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
preform is held by being pressed against the block of thermal insulant by 

means of a shaping ply. 
The method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized 
in that the preform is made by draping two-dimensional fiber plies over the 

outside surface of the block of thermal insulant. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that the panel 
of thermostructural composite material is made by applying the following 

steps:  
 


draping over the block of thermal insulant two-dimensional 
fiber plies preimpregnated with a precursor of the composite material matrix; 

and 
transforming the precursor to obtain the material that 
constitutes the matrix. 
The method according to any one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterized in that the number of plies draped varies so as to make a 

panel having portions of greater thickness than the remainder of the panel. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the block of thermal insulant is porous. 
The method according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
surface of the block of thermal insulant is protected to avoid the block being 

densified by the material that constitutes the matrix of the composite 
material of the panel. 
The method according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
surface of the block is protected by depositing a sealing layer thereon. 
The method according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
surface of the block is protected by installing a non-porous interposition ply 

on the block. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the block of thermal insulant is made of porous 

ceramic. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the block of thermal insulant is made by molding a 

composition that constitutes a precursor for a ceramic, and by transforming 
the precursor. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the block of thermal insulant is made of a porous 

ceramic reinforced by fibers.
