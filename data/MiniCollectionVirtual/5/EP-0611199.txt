<CLAIMS>
Portable mobile radio transceiver for direct
communication with a radio relay station on a satellite, the

transceiver including a casing (1) with a microphone (2) and
an earpiece (3) and an antenna (4) mounted on said casing, the

transceiver being such that the main direction of radiation of
the antenna (4) is substantially vertical when the casing (1)

is in a position of use in which it is held in the hand near
the head of the user, characterised in that the casing (1) is

provided with a pivoting antenna support (5) having at least a
first locking position (6) and a second locking position (7),

said first and second locking positions respectively
corresponding to two symmetrical orientations of the antenna

relative to the longitudinal direction of the casing and thus
two positions of use in which the casing is respectively held

in the right hand or the left hand.
Transceiver according to claim 1 wherein the antenna
support (5) has a third locking position (8) corresponding to

an orientation of the antenna in which the main direction of
radiation is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the

casing.
