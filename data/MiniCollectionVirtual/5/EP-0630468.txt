<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are disclosed for accurately and economically measuring fluid flow within a closed conduit system. The apparatus includes a means (12) for extracting a proportional amount of the fluid flow, a flowmeter (28) reduced in size from the main conduit system for measuring the flow of the extracted proportional amount of fluid, and a means (22) for returning the extracted portion of fluid to the fluid flow. The fluid flow is extracted and returned without disrupting the fluid flow. A means for promoting the extraction of the proportional amount of fluid flow is provided within said conduit between the means for extracting and returning the fluid flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN-LINE PARALLEL PROPORTIONALLY PARTITIONED BY-PASS METERING DEVICE AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the measurement of fluid flow. More particularly, the present invention is directed towards an in-line parallel partitioned by-pass metering device and method of measuring fluid flow within a closed conduit system. 5 Fluid flow measurement is widely practiced and fulfills an array of purposes including energy distribution, custody transfer, regulation, control and research. The measuring unit, i.e. "flowmeter", typically consists of a primary and a secondary device. The primary device is acted upon by the fluid directly, and the secondary device converts the primary device's response to the fluid into an observable quantity. Flowmeters are10 generally classified into those which measure quantity of fluid flow and those which measure rate.Because of the wide practice of fluid flow measurement, engineers have a greater choice when specifying a flowmeter than for perhaps any other process measuring, monitoring device. Currently, there are over one hundred types of flowmeters available,15 and expenditures on flowmeters exceed one billion dollars per year. Thus in choosing a flowmeter, an engineer will typically evaluate: (1) the degree of accuracy and/or precision required, (2) the suitability of the flowmeter to the particular application and conditions, and (3) the cost of the various alternative flowmeters and other limitations such as space requirements, and the like.20 The selection of a flowmeter requires an understanding of the flow behavior of fluids. First, a fluid is any matter which undergoes continuous deformation upon being subjected to shearing forces. Viscosity is that property of a fluid by which it offers resistance to deformation or shear. The response of a fluid subjected to shearing forces is "flow". The type of flow, whether laminar, turbulent, cavitational, or some combination,25 depends upon the fluid viscosity and other parameters of the fluid flow system. Second, a fluid in motion, i.e., flowing, possesses energy. This energy may be displacement or pressure energy, velocity or kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal or internal energy, or some combination of these forms of energy. Flowmeters utilize the energy of a fluid/â€¢* in motion to monitor fluid flow. Therefore, an engineer must also consider the type of30 flow and the energy of the fluid flow when selecting a flowmeter.Flowmeters which measure quantity repeatedly measure a fixed
