<ABSTRACT>
A DC type gas-discharge display panel comprises a 
plurality of discharge cells (DCE); discharge current 

limiting means (R) provided for each of the discharge cells 
(DCE), for limiting a discharge current of each of said 

discharge cells (DCE); and a filling gas filled into each of 
said discharge cells (DCE), and having an inert gas mixture. 

The discharge current limiting means (R) may be a resistor 
(R) formed between two adjoining lines of second conductive 

lines (AB) and second electrodes (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC type
gas-discharge display panel and a gas-discharge display
apparatus using the DC type gas-discharge
display panel.First of all, the publications related to the present
invention are listed as follows:
(1). "A 17-in High Resolution DC Plasma Display" by Niwa et
al., The Journal of the Institute of Television
Engineers of Japan, Vol. 44, No. 5 (1990) pp. 571 - 577.(2). "A 20-in Color DC Gas-Discharge Panel for TV
Display" by Murakami et al., IEEE Transactions on Electron
Devices, Vol. 36, No. 6, June 1989, pp. 1063-1072.(3)."Ultra-Low Reflectivity Color Display Gas-Discharge
Panel" by Sakai et al., The Journal of the Institute of
Television Engineers of Japan Vol. 42, No. 10 (1988) pp.
1084-1090.(4). U.S. Patent No. 4,780,644, "Gas-Discharge
Display Panel".(5). "Plasma Display Panel with a Resistor in each
Cell" by Takano et al., Annual Convention of Institute of
Television Engineers of Japan, 1990, Provisional Report
4-3, pp. 77-78.A first conventional DC type gas-discharge
panel has structure thereof as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B.
Fig. 1A is a sectional view of this first conventional 
gas-discharge panel, and Fig. 1B is a plan view thereof, as
viewed from a display side.In Figs. 1A and 1B, symbol "FP" indicates a front plate
(glass); symbol "BM", shows a black grid (black matrix);
symbol "BA" is a partition; symbol "A" shows an anode
(indium tin oxide); symbol "Ph" denotes phosphor; symbol "Ct'
shows a cathode (Ni); symbol "D" indicates a dielectric
material; symbol "TH" denotes a third electrode; and symbol
"RP" shows a rear plate (glass). A detailed explanation of
this gas-display panel is described in above-mentioned
publication (1). In this panel, the display panel of the
X-Y matrix is driven by the 1-line at-a-time drive method,
and a relatively large current (about 490 ÂµA) flows
therethrough. As a result, the light-emission efficiency is
0.025 lm/W (white), which implies a low efficiency, and
therefore this display panel is not utilized as a color
television receiver panel except for a TV receiver panel for
special purposes. In this display panel, He (partial
pressure ratio of 93%) - Kr (5%) - Xe (2%) gas is employed
as the filling gas, and total pressure thereof is 53 kPa
(400 Torr).In Fig. 2, there is shown a second conventional DC type
gas-discharge display panel. It should be noted that the
same reference symbols shown in Figs. 1A and 1B are employed
to denote the same constructive elements shown in Fig. 2.
There are other reference symbols in which
