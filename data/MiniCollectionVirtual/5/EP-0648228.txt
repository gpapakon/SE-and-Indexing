<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides antibodies for use in a method of immunoassay being antibodies specific to the polypeptide comprising amino acids 1-76 of N-terminal brain natriuretic factor BNP(1-76). Also provided are methods and kits for the diagnosis or prognosis of conditions in which BNP(1-76) is a diagnostic or predictive indicator e.g. heart failure or hypervolaemia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the N-terminal section of
Brain Natriuretic Peptide Prohormone, BNP(1-76) and the
use of antibodies against this in immunoassays in
biological fluids for the purpose of biological research
and medical diagnosis, for example of heart failure or
hypervolaemia.Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome
especially among elderly people. Population surveys
indicate that the condition affects about 2% of the
total population in the western world. The syndrome
usually presents itself with an insidious onset with
unspecific symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, fatigue
and peripheral oedemas. To establish the diagnosis the
physician usually must either rely on his clinical
experience or refer the patient to a cardiological
center for echocardiography, radionuclide scanning,
exercise testing or catheterization.Heart disease represents a significant drain on
health resources in many major countries, and whilst an
early diagnosis may help in controlling the condition
and preventing rapid progression to severe heart
failure, it would obviously be preferable to be able to
identify those patients in which heart failure is likely
to occur before it actually does so, ie. to prognose
rather than diagnose.Unfortunately, there are at present no completely
satisfactory methods for predicting the likelihood of
heart failure. Problems frequently observed with such
methods are insufficient accuracy and sensitivity, and
the disadvantages of the necessity for expensive
equipment requiring specially trained personnel (eg. in
echocardiography). A need therefore exists for a simple
method of accurately and sensitively, not only
diagnosing, but also predicting the likelihood of onset 
of heart failure.Whilst heart failure can be defined as a
symptomatic state ie. an overt disease or syndrome,
patients may frequently pass through a state of
asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction ie. a sub-clinical
condition without overt symptoms, before heart failure
manifests itself. However, we have now found that not
all patients having cardiac dysfunction go on to develop
severe heart failure, and that the risk of heart failure
for some such people is much greater than for others.
To be able to identify those people at particular risk
of developing heart failure in order that they may be
caught and treated before heart failure occurs would be
of great clinical importance; at the moment existing
treatments eg. ACE inhibitors are very expensive and it
is not cost-effective for everyone to be treated to try
to prevent the onset

human BNP(1-76). 
A method as claimed in claim 9 in which a known
quantity of labelled human BNP(1-76) or an antigenic

fragment thereof or polypeptide extension thereof
lacking BNP activity is added to an analyte solution and

contacted with a limited quantity of immobilised
antibody against human BNP(1-76) to provide a

competitive binding assay.
Labelled human BNP(1-76) or an antigenic fragment
thereof or polypeptide extension thereof lacking BNP

activity.
Human BNP(1-76) or an antigenic fragment thereof or
polypeptide extension thereof lacking BNP activity and

having at least one antigenic epitope of human
BNP(1-76), conjugated to one or more immunogenic

polypeptides.
A kit for immunoassay of human BNP(1-76) or an
antigenic fragment or polypeptide extension thereof

lacking BNP activity comprising:

antigenic fragment or polypeptide extension thereof
lacking BNP activity;
(c) said monoclonal or polyclonal antibody in non-immobilised
form;
(d) a labelled secondary antibody specific to said
antibody (c).
A method of diagnosis or prognosis of a condition
in which the concentration of human BNP(1-76) or an

antigenic fragment or polypeptide extension thereof
lacking BNP activity is a diagnostic or predictive

indicator, wherein a body fluid of a patient is 
subjected 
in vitro
 to immunoassay to detect or assay the
presence or quantity therein of human BNP(1-76).
A method for the production of an antibody as
claimed in claim 1 wherein human BNP(1-76) or an

antigenic fragment or polypeptide extension thereof
lacking BNP activity, if necessary conjugated to an

immunogenic protein or polypeptide, is injected into a
non-human host animal to provide a serum containing a

polyclonal antibody or spleen cells which are
subsequently converted to hybridomas or immortalised

cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies.
