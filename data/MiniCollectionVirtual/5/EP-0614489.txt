<DESCRIPTION>
In eukaryotic cells, mitosis is initiated following
the activation of a protein kinase known as "M-phase
promoting factor" (MPF; also known as the H-phase specific
histone kinase, or more simply as the H-phase kinase).
This kinase consists of at least three subunits: the
catalytic subunit (cdc2), a regulatory subunit (cyclin B)
and a low molecular weight subunit (p13-Sucl) (Brizuela,
L. et al., EMBO J.6:3507-3514 (1987); Dunphy, W. et al.,
Cell54:423-431 (1988); Gautier, J. et al., Cell
54:433-439 (1988); Arion, D. et al., Cell55:371-378
(1988); Draetta, G. et al., Cell56:829-838 (1989);
Booher, R. et al., Cell58:485-497 (1989); Labbe, J-C. et
al., EMBO J.8:3053-3058 (1989); Meijer, L. et al., EMBO
J.8:2275-2282 (1989); Gautier, J. et al., Cell60:487-494
(1990); Gautier, J. and J. Maller, EMBO J.10:177-182
(1991)). cdc2 and related kinases also associate with
other cyclins (Giordana, A. et al., Cell58:981-990
(1989); Draetta, G. et al., Cell56:829-838 (1989);
Richardson, H.E. et al., Cell59:1127-1133 (1989)), and
comprise a family of related enzymes that act at various
stages of the division cycle (Paris, J. et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA88:1039-1043 (1990); Elledge, S.J.
and M.R. spottswood, EMBO J.10:2653-2659 (1991); Tsai,
L-H. et al., Nature353:174-177 (1991)).The cdc2/cyclin B enzyme is subject to multiple
levels of control. Among these, the regulation of the
catalytic subunit by tyrosine phosphorylation is the best
understood. In a variety of eukaryotic cell types, cdc2
is one of the most heavily tyrosine phosphorylated 
proteins (Draetta, G. et al., Nature336:738-744 (1988);
Dunphy, W.G. and J.W. Newport, Cell58:181-431 (1989);
Morla, A.O. et al., Cell 58:193-203 (1989)).
Phosphorylation of the tyrosine 15 and also threonine 14
residues of cdc2 is regulated, in part, by the
accumulation of cyclin above a threshold level at which
association with cdc2 occurs (Solomon, M.J. et al., Cell
63:1013-2024 (1990)). Tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits
the cdc2/cyclin B enzyme, and tyrosine dephosphorylation,
which occurs at the onset of mitosis, directly activates
the pre-MPF complex (Gautier J. et al., Nature339:626-629
(1989); Labbe, J.C. et al., EMBO J.8:3053-3058 (1989);
Morla, A.O. et al., Cell 58:193-203 (1989); Dunphy, W.G.
and J.W. Newport, Cell 58:181-431 (1989); Morla, A.O. et
al., Cell 58:193-203 (1989); Could, K. and P. Nurse,
Nature342:39-45 (1989): Jessus, C. et al., FEBS LETTERS
266:4-8 (1990)).Given the role of cdc2 dephosphorylation in activation
of MPF, there is much interest in the
