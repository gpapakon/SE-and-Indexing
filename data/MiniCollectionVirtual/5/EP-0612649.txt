<ABSTRACT>
This telescopic steering shaft, particularly for a motor vehicle, of the type including two tubular and cylindrical shaft portions (2, 3) which can be moved in terms of sliding one inside the other, one of which (3) includes external axial splines (4) designed to interact with complementary internal splines (5) on the other shaft portion and means for absorbing impact energy by controlling the axial displacement of the shaft portions with respect to one another, is characterised in that the energy-absorption means are formed from at least one zone (6, 7) of deformed cross-section on at least one of the shaft portions (2, 3), giving rise to localised ovalisation of the latter, allowing one of the shaft portions to be fitted under prestress in the other.
