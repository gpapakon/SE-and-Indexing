<DESCRIPTION>
 4-HYDROXY COUMARIN DERIVATIVES WITH ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITYThe present application relates to 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. The compounds are useful as antibacterial agents.United States Patent No. 4,078,075 refers to a 3-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)- carbamoyl-4-hydroxy-coumarin compound useful in combating insect pests particularly of the species Heliothis virescens.United States Patent No. 3,511 ,892 refers to a 3-(4-aminophenyl)carbamoyl)-4- hydroxycoumarin compound useful as bactericides and fungicides for the control of a wide variety of organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. Bacillus substilis. Mvcobacterium phlet, Salmonella tvphosa. Aerobacter aeroqenes. Escherichia coli. Trichophvton mentaqrophvtes. Pullularia pullulans and Cundida alpicans and other fungal organisms such as downey mildew and tomato late blight.United States Patent No. 3,112,557 refers to 4,5,7-trihydroxycoumarin-3-N- phenylcarboxamide and 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-alpha-pyrone-3-(N-p-hydroxyphenyl)- carboxamide, 4-hydroxy-5:6-benzo-2-alpha-pyrone-3-(N-p-hydroxyphenyl)- carboxamide compounds useful for their antibacterial or fungicidal activity in human or veterinary therapy.The present invention relates to compounds of the formulawherein R1 is hydrogen, 

 or halogen; R2 is hydrogen, halogen, nitro, amino, (C,-C6)alkoxy or (C,-Cβ)alkylthio; R3 is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, amino or (Cr Cβ)alkoxy; R4 is hydrogen, halogen, (C Cβ)alkyl, 

 amino or nitro; R5, R6, R7, and R8 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, (C,-Cβ)alkenyl, (C,-C6)alkyl, (CTCgJhaloalkyl, (CTCaJalkoxy, phenyl(Cr C6)alkoxy, (C2-C8)acyl, (C1-C6)thioalkoxy, pyrrolyl, 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl or pyrazinyl with the proviso that when R6 is other than acyl, 

pyrrolyl, (C^CaJalkoxy or 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl, or R8 is trifluoromethyl, at least one of R1 , R2, R3 and R4 is not hydrogen.More specific compounds of formula V are those wherein at least one of R5, R6, R7, and R8 is halogen, hydroxy, acyl or nitro, and at least one of R\ R2, R3 and R4 is not hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy or nitro.Preferred compounds of the invention include 4-hydroxy-3-[4'- chlorophenyl)carbamoyl-4-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin, 4-hydroxy-3-[4'-methoxy- 3'-(3"-methyl-2"-butenyl)phenyl]carbamoylcoumarin, 4-hydroxy-3-(4'-pyrrolyl-3'- trifluoromethylphenyl)carbamoylcoumarin, 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(4'- trifluoromethylphenyl)carbamoylcoumarin.More specific compounds of
