<ABSTRACT>
Method of compressing combustible gas flowing through a conduit (3) provided with a non-return inlet valve (10) arranged at its inlet end (5) and with an open-ended tubular (13) arranged in the conduit (3) comprising (a) allowing combustible gas to enter into the conduit (3); (b) supplying oxidant to the combustible gas in the tubular (13), the amount of oxidant being equal to the amount of oxidant required to combust at least part of the combustible gas in the tubular (13); (c) allowing the mixture of combustible gas and oxidant to ignite in the tubular (13), which ignition yields a high pressure wave front closing the non-return inlet valve (10) and pushing gas out of the tubular (13) and entraining gas flowing through the annular space (17) and a low pressure wave front; and (d) allowing the non-return inlet valve (10) to open on arrival of the low pressure wave front, followed by steps (a) through (d).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compressing 
combustible gas flowing through a conduit. An example of 
such combustible gas is natural gas. A suitable application of the present invention is 
downhole compression of natural gas, this is done to 
enhance the production from an underground natural gas 
reservoir. Natural gas is produced from an underground 
reservoir containing natural gas through a tubing 
arranged in a well drilled to the reservoir. During 
production, the cumulative amount of natural gas produced 
increases and consequently the reservoir pressure will 
decrease. As a result of the decrease in reservoir 
pressure the production rate decreases and, in order to 
maintain the production rate at an economically 
acceptable level the gas has to be compressed and 
suitably gas is compressed downhole. This downhole gas 
compression will result in an increased economic 
cumulative production. USA patent specification No. 2 899 287 discloses a 
method of compressing an oxidant-containing gas flowing 
through a conduit provided with a tubular arranged 
coaxially in the conduit which tubular has an inlet end 
and an outlet end and is provided with a non-return inlet 
valve at its inlet end. The known method comprises the 
steps of 
(a) supplying fuel into the tubular; (b) allowing oxidant to enter into the tubular 
through the non-return inlet valve; (c) allowing the mixture of fuel and oxidant to 
ignite, which ignition yields a high pressure wave front 
closing the non-return inlet valve and pushing gas out of  
 
the outlet end of the tubular and a low pressure wave 
front; and (d) allowing the non-return inlet valve to open on 
arrival of the low pressure wave front, followed by steps 
(a) through (d). In the known method the pressure increase for the 
compression stage is very small, the pressure at the 
outlet end of the conduit is about 2 or 3% above the 
pressure at the inlet end. For pumping natural gas such a 
pressure increase for a compression stage is unacceptably 
small. Therefore it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a method of compressing a combustible gas 
which will yield a much larger pressure increase per 
compression stage. To this end in accordance with the invention there is 
provided a method of compressing combustible natural gas 
flowing at a downhole location in a natural gas production 
well through a conduit which contains a non-return 
inlet valve arranged at its inlet end and with a 
tubular which is open at both ends such that an annular 
passage is

A method of compressing a combustible natural gas 
flowing at a downhole location in a natural gas 

production well through a conduit (3) which contains a 
non-return inlet valve (10) arranged at its inlet end and 

a tubular (13) which is open at both ends such that an 
annular passage (17) is defined between the conduit (3) 

and tubular (13), which method comprises the steps of 

(a) allowing gas to enter into the conduit (3) 
through the non-return inlet valve (10); 
(b) creating a combustible mixture in the 
tubular (13) by supplying such an amount of oxidant that 

at least part of the combustible natural gas is 
combustible in the tubular (13); 
(c) allowing the mixture to ignite in the tubular, 
which ignition yields a high pressure wave front closing 

the non-return inlet valve and pushing gas out of the 
tubular and a low pressure wave front; and 
(d) allowing the non-return inlet valve to open on 
arrival of the low pressure wave front, followed by steps 

(a) through (d). 
An apparatus for carrying out the method of 
compressing gas according to claim 1, comprising a 

conduit (3), a non-return inlet valve (10) arranged at 
the inlet end of the conduit, a tubular (13) arranged 

coaxially in the conduit (3) downstream of the non-return 
inlet valve (10) such that an annular passage is defined 

between the tubular (13) and the conduit (3), a localized 
ignition source (20) arranged in the tubular (13), 

characterized in that the conduit (3) is locatable at a 
downhole location in a natural gas production well, that 

the tubular (13) is open at both ends and equipped with  
 

an oxidant supply (18) through which such an amount of 
oxidant can be supplied that at least part of the natural 

gas is combusted in the tubular (13).

inlet valve (10) is provided with a control device 

allowing opening the inlet valve at a pre-determined 
pressure difference. 
The apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the 
localized ignition source (20) is formed by a glow plug.
