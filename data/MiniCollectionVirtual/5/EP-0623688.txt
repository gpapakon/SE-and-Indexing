<ABSTRACT>
A decomposable masking member (11, 21, 31, 41) is 
provided for use in protecting a part of an article (13, 

23, 33, 43) from a surface treatment or in providing 
protection from damage. The masking member is attached to 

the part of the article and is removed after use. The 
masking member is decomposable biologically, optically, 

thermally or the like. In the case of the masking member 
being biologically decomposable, the removed masking member 

may be buried in the ground or used as compost. In the 
case of the masking member being optically decomposable, 

the removed masking member is irradiated by ultraviolet 
rays. In the case of the masking member being thermally 

decomposable, the removed masking member is decomposed by 
the application of heat. The material of the masking 

member may be a polymer that is thermally decomposable to 
its constituent monomer(s) in order that, during heating, 

the constituent monomer(s) may be collected as the masking 
member is decomposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decomposable 
masking member suitable for use in protecting a part of an 
article from a surface treatment such as coating, plating, 
vacuum evaporation and the like or in providing protection 
from damage during transportation, storage and the like. 
In use, the masking member is attached to the part of the 
article and is removed after use. Previously masking members have been made of plastics 
materials, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene 
and the like, or foams thereof, (Jikkai Sho 62-5852). Such 
masking members have been burnt after use. This has 
required the provision of an incinerator or the like to 
burn the masking member and a lot of energy may be wasted 
during burning. Furthermore, the exhaust gas from the said 
incinerator or the like can contaminate the atmosphere. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a masking member made of decomposable 
material. The masking member is preferably biologically 
decomposable, optically decomposable or thermally 
decomposable. When the material is biologically decomposable it is 
preferred that the material be predominantly (i) a 
microorganism-decomposable polyester, (ii) carbohydrate or 
denatured carbohydrate-based, (iii) protein-based, (iv) a 
naturally occurring material or a denatured naturally 
occurring material, (v) a mixture of a microorganism and 
plastics material, (vi) a mixture of plastics material and 
a microorganism-decomposable material, or (vii) any 
combination of any of these materials. Where the material is optically decomposable, the 
material is, preferably, predominantly an optically 
decomposable plastics material. The material may, for 
example, be predominantly (i) a vinyl homopolymer or 
copolymer, (ii) poly 1,2-butadiene, polyisobutylene oxide,  
 
acrylate-oxide methacrylate or the like, (iii) a mixture of 
an optically decomposable plastics material and an 
ultraviolet absorber and/or photosensitizer, or (iv) any 
combination of any of these materials. Where the material is thermally decomposable, the 
material is, preferably, predominantly a polymer that is 
thermally decomposable to its constituent monomer(s). For 
example, the material may be predominantly polyacrylate, 
polymethacrylate, polyalkylmethacrylate or 
polyalkylacrylate. The material of the masking member may be foamed or 
molded, preferably into a shape to conform with a part of a 
surface to be masked by the masking member. According to a further aspect of the present 
invention
