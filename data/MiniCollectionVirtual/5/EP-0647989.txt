<ABSTRACT>
A coaxial connector plug (2) includes an inner 
insulting housing carrying a coaxial connector pin (6), 

where an outer grounding spring (8) is positioned 
coaxially around the housing (4). The grounding spring is 

positioned within an outer sleeve (14) and a locking 
spring (12) and outer sleeve (14) are axially moveable 

between positions where the locking arms are moveable to 
a position where a front edge (99) of the locking arm (96) 

is engaged with a corresponding surface (56) of member 
(10). Locking arm (96) also includes a locking projection 

at (98) which will reside in a peripheral groove (152) of 
a mating jack connector (150) when fully inserted thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to coaxial connectors 
and to locking mechanisms to retain counterpart jacks and 
plugs together. It is common in coaxial connector pairs comprised of 
plugs and jacks to include some kind of locking mechanism 
between the cooperating pairs to retain the two connectors 
together. One such method is the so called "Bayonet" style 
which includes a rotatable cap generally found on the plug 
which contains an axial entry slot on the inner diameter, 
of the rotatable cap which is continuous with a slot which 
extends at an acute angle relative to the transverse 
direction. The mating jack includes on its outer diameter 
a circular lug which is slidably receivable into the axial 
portion of the slot of the cap, whereupon the cap can be 
rotated and the lug is presented in the angled portion of 
the slot, causing the two corresponding connector parts to 
be brought together. Another version includes a rotatable 
cap similar to that described above however has a 
continuous thread on its internal diameter which is 
threadable onto associated threads on the outside diameter 
of the jack whereby the two connector parts can be screwed 
together. However in either case, these types of 
connectors tend to be very expensive and time consuming to 
manufacture. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide 
a design of coaxial connector which is easier to assemble. It is a further object of the invention to provide a 
more cost-effective design of coaxial connector system. The invention will now be described by way of 
reference to the drawing figures, where;

centre line of the subject invention; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of the inner

<CLAIMS>
A coaxial connector (2) comprised of an inner 
terminal (6) and an outer conductor (8) coaxially 

positioned relative to the inner terminal (6), with an 
insulative housing (4) therebetween, the connector (2) 

further comprising a locking element (12, 14) supported by 
said outer conductor (8) for locking engagement with a 

mating connector (150), the connector (2) being 
characterized in that the locking element (1) is comprised 

of a locking spring (12), moveable axially of said outer 
conductor (8), and carrying spring locking arms (96) which 

are adapted for engagement in a peripheral groove (152) of 
a mating connector (150). 
The coaxial connector (2) of claim 1, characterized 
in that a sleeve member (10) is disposed about the inner 

terminal (6), outer terminal (8) and the insulative 
housing (4) therebetween, the locking element (12) being 

displaceable thereupon. 
The coaxial connector (2) of claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that an outer sleeve (14) is coupled with the locking 

spring (12). 
The coaxial connector (2) of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the sleeve member (10) includes an open forward 

ring (50) for receiving the mating connector (150). 
The coaxial connector (2) of claim 2, 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the sleeve member (10) includes a rearwardly 

facing surface (56) cooperating with the spring arms (96) 
to maintain engagement with the peripheral groove (152). 
The coaxial connector (2) of claim 5, characterized 
 

in that the spring arms (96) contain forwardly facing cam 
surfaces (99) that abut the rearwardly facing surface (56) 

in a manner that prevents opening of the spring arms (96).
