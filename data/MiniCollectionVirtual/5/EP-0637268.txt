<ABSTRACT>
For coating or printing plastic films with water or solvent-containing coating agents or mixtures thereof, u/v-curable paints or inks and PVC pastes, and especially for printing with water-soluble printing inks, in order to avoid long drying stages and to maintain a precise register, the film is laid upon a substrate and heated until adhesive properties are produced, then cooled while still on the substrate, coated or printed while still adhering to the substrate, dried and finally cooled and removed from the substrate. Thus the adhesion of the film to the substrate after the production of adhesive properties subsists even after cooling and before coating or printing.

Process for coating or printing a plastics film 
with aqueous coating media, solvent-containing coating 

media or mixtures of aqueous and solvent-containing 
coating media, UV-curable paints or inks, or PVC pastes, 

comprising the following working steps: 

a) depositing the plastics film on a continuous conveyor 
belt and heating the plastics film until the 

plastics film develops adhesiveness to the conveyor 
belt, 
b) cooling the plastics film, while it continues to 
remain on the conveyor belt, 
c) coating the plastics film with the coating medium or 
printing it with the ink, while it continues to lie 

adhering to the conveyor belt, 
d) drying the applied medium or the applied ink, and 
e) cooling the plastics film and removing it from the 
conveyor belt. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the plastics film is coated with an aqueous coating 

medium or printed with a water-soluble ink. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the solvent employed for the solvent-containing 

coating media is ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, xylene, 
butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylformamide, methylglycol 

acetate and/or tetrahydrofuran. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the conveyor belt employed is a continuously circulating, 

heat-resistant special conveyor belt which can be 
produced from aramid, polyamide or polyester blend  

 
fabric, nonwovens or felts. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a conveyor belt is employed to 

which a coating, such as a hard rubber coating or a 
coating comprising a commercially customary thermoplastic 

polymer, is applied. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that a conveyor belt is employed on 
which a release coat has been applied. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a scarified or embossed conveyor 

belt is employed for embossing films or coatings. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the film or product web or sheet, or coating, lying 

on the smooth conveyor belt, is blown or pulled by vacuum 
or mechanically transferred to an embossed belt and is 

then embossed and, in a known manner, drawn off at the 
end. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by at least partial heating of the plastics 

film directly before its deposition on the conveyor belt. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by heating of the plastics film from its 

side to be coated or printed. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by at least partial heating of the plastics 

film after its deposition on the conveyor belt. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by heating of the plastics film by heat 

absorption from the conveyor belt. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by cooling of the plastics film, prior to 

its coating or printing, from its side to be coated or 
printed.
