<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an impact wrench and a 
bolt-tightening method wherein a spring force is applied, through the 

circumference of a spindle (6) coupled with the output shaft of an 
electric motor, in the forward direction to a hammer (8) which is 

capable of forward and rearward movement and of rotational motion 
following said spindle (6), with said hammer (8) and impact shaft (9) 

being brought in coaxial mesh alignment by leaving a gap between them 
in the direction of rotation so that when a bolt to be tightened is 

inserted into a socket fixed to an end of said impact shaft (9) to 
permit the bolt to be tightened, the mesh contact with said impact 

shaft (9) is released as a result of said hammer (8) being lifted up 
in the rearward direction against the reaction force due to the 

tightening of said bolt, and as said hammer (8) is again brought into 
mesh contact with the impact shaft (9) under the spring force applied 

in the forward direction so that an impact force is generated with 
respect to the direction of rotation of said impact shaft (9), an 

impact sensor (31) detecting the release of said hammer (8) from said 
impact shaft (9) and an angle sensor (32) measuring the angle of 

rotation of said impact shaft (9) are provided, so as to measure the 
torque of said impact shaft (9) by measuring the amount by which the 

angle of rotation of said impact shaft (9) advances each time said 
impact force is generated and to measure the amount by which the 

angle of rotation of said impact shaft (9) advances from the time at 
which said measured torque has reached the previously set snug torque 

value, so that the power supply to said electric motor is 
disconnected when the amount of advancement of the rotational angle 

has reached the pre-defined value of the preset angle of rotation to 
stop the rotation of said impact shaft (9) through the braking 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to railway construction, and 
particularly concerns an impact wrench for the tightening of bolts 
for railway track fixed by means of a plate-shaped tightening spring, 
and further relates to a method for tightening bolts using an impact 
wrench designed so that bolt tightening is achieved with the required 
spring compression force by measuring the angle of rotation of the 
impact shaft from the time of the preset snug torque's being 
generated. Track rails have hitherto been secured by tightening bolts 
on to wooden, metal and concrete crossties or sleepers by means of a 
plate-shaped tightening spring to hold down the rail. In tightening 
these bolts, a significant level of skill is necessary as the 
application of the required tightening torque for tightening the 
bolts with the conventional impact wrench up to the prescribed spring 
compression force has had to be left to the judgement and skill of 
the operator. The familiar impact wrench is designed so that a hammer is 
coaxially meshed with the impact shaft to rotate the bolt-tightening 
socket, with an axial force being applied to said hammer by means of 
a spring in the direction of the impact shaft. When bolts are 
tightened, the hammer rotates under the drive force of the electric 
motor and said impact shaft rotates while the hammer and the impact 
shaft are in mesh. When the bolt-tightening reaction force overcomes 
the spring force applied to the hammer, however, the hammer will be 
lifted and separated from the impact shaft to permit its free 
rotation. Immediately after this, the hammer is again subjected to 
the spring's compression force to come into mesh with the impact 
shaft. As this mesh contact is obtained, a knocking force is applied 
to the impact shaft while the hammer is rotating so as to tighten the 
bolts.  
 The impact wrench thus requires a specific timing at which 
the measurement of the angle of rotation is commenced in order to 
ensure that the bolts are tightened by the fixed angle of rotation 
previously set by the rotational angle method. To achieve automatic control of the conventional type of 
impact wrench, the inventor has achieved further progress with the 
invention of an impact wrench using the rotating angle method in such 
a manner that the angle of rotation of the impact wrench is measured 
and the electric motor is stopped when the predetermined angle of 
rotation has been reached. (Japanese Utility Model Registration

An impact wrench comprising a motor, a spindle (6) coupled 
with the output shaft of the motor, a hammer (8) which is capable of 

forward and rearward movement and of rotational motion following said 
spindle (6), and a socket (18, 24) fixed to an end of said impact 

shaft (9) to engage a fastener (36, 39a) to be tightened, wherein the 
hammer (8) is resiliently urged in the forward direction into coaxial 

mesh alignment with the impact shaft (9) and cam surfaces (8, 10, 13)

the impact shaft (9) when the torque exerted by the spindle (6) on 
the hammer (8) exceeds a preset value, a gap being left between the 

hammer (8) and the impact shaft (9) in the direction of rotation so 
that when the mesh contact between the hammer (8) and the impact 

shaft (9) is released as a result of said hammer (8) moving against 
the resilient force, said hammer (8) is again brought into mesh 

contact with the impact shaft (9) under the spring force applied in

impact shaft (9) by measuring the angle through which the impact 

shaft (9) advances each time said impact force is generated, the 
angle sensor (32) serving also to measure the total angle through
