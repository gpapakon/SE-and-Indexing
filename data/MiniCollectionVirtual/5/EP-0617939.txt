<ABSTRACT>
Disposable diaper which comprises a front part and a back part provided with an elasticity which is to act upon the hip line. Flexible elements are applied to one outer layer of a disposable diaper around the first and second leg openings, so that a first flexible element provided around a first leg opening extends further along a curved path into the front part and the back part and ends at a lateral edge of the front part and the back part, whereas a second flexible element provided around a second leg opening extends along the curved path into the front part and the back part and ends at the other lateral edge of the front part and the back part. The respective flexible elements each comprise a multiplicity of rubber-like, elastic threads which extend in parallel to one another.

<CLAIMS>
A disposable diaper comprising a liquid-permeable
topsheet (2), a liquid-impermeable backsheet (3), a liquid-absorbent

core (4) sandwiched therebetween, and elastic
members (11, 12, 52) provided around a waist-opening and leg-openings,

respectively, wherein the elastic members (11, 12)
provided around said leg-openings comprise a first elastic

member (11) and a second elastic member (12) including a
plurality of rubber-like elastic threads (11A, 11B, 11C; 12A,

12B, 12C) extending in parallel with one another from
transversely opposite side edges (13, 14) of a crotch zone

(7) along a curved path into the front (5) and rear bodies
(6), 
characterized in that
 the first elastic member (11)
associated with the left leg-opening further extends into the

front (5) and rear bodies (6) and terminates at a side edge
(17, 18) of the front (5) and rear bodies (6) while the

second elastic member (12) associated with a second leg-opening
further extends into the front (5) and rear bodies

(6) and terminates at the other opposite side edge (15, 16)
of the front (5) and rear bodies (6).
A disposable diaper according to Claim 1, wherein an
interthread spacing of said plural rubber-like elastic

threads (11A, 11B, 11C; 12A, 12B, 12C) is progressively

widened as they get near the respective side edges (15, 16,
17, 18) of the front (5) and rear bodies (6). 
A disposable diaper according to Claim 1, wherein said
first elastic member (11) crosses said second elastic member

(12) on longitudinal center areas of said front (5) and rear
bodies (6) and thereby said first and second elastic members

(11, 12) define a loop-shaped seal surrounding a central zone
of said diaper.
A disposable diaper according to Claim 1, wherein
an elongation stress of portions extending over said crotch

zone (7) is adjusted to be higher than those of portions
extending over said front (5) and rear bodies (6).
