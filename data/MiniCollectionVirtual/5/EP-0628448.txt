<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical lock comprising a lock housing (14), a rod 
(12) axially movable through said housing, said rod being 

normally locked against movement through said housing by 
coil spring means (32, 34) tightly wound about said rod, 

said spring means being axially captive between end bearing 
means (52, 54) in said housing, and means (46) for partially 

unwinding said spring means thereby to release said rod for 
movement through said housing, said end bearing means being 

adjustable in an initial condition of said lock for removing 
free play of said spring means between said end bearing

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains generally to the field of
mechanical locking devices of the type having a rod normally
locked against axial movement through a lock housing by a
clutch spring of reduced diameter, where the rod is released
by partially unwinding the spring (see for example US-A-4 577 730,
corresponding to the preamble of claim 1).The device of this invention pertains to a class of
mechanical locks which generally have a rod axially movable
through a lock housing, one or more coil springs tightly wound
about the rod and axially fixed to the housing so as to
normally grip the rod against movement through the housing. A
release is provided for partially unwinding the coil spring or
springs such that the internal diameter of the spring is
increased and the rod is released for axial movement relative 
to the lock housing. Linear locks of this type have been in
widespread use, particularly in recliner seats used in
automobiles and other vehicles. In such installations, the
housing of the mechanical lock is attached to one of the
reclinable backrest or the stationary seat, while the end of
the rod is connected to the other of those two seat
components. In its normally locked condition the device fixes
the position of the backrest. If the occupant desires to
reposition the backrest, the lock is manually released, which
frees the rod and allows movement of the backrest. The
mechanical lock typically has a heavier exterior coil spring
which returns the rod to an extended condition when the lock
is released. For example, the spring may serve to bring the
seat backrest to a fully upright condition. One relatively
early example of such a lock is disclosed in U.S. Patent
3,874,480 issued to Porter et al. and owned by the Assignee of
this patent application.In applications where bi-directional loading of the rod
is anticipated, two springs may be provided, one on each side
of a common release lever and axially contained between two
end bushings, each bushing engaging an end tang of a
corresponding spring to fix the tang and the outer end coils
of the spring against rotation about the rod. The inner end
coils of the springs are connected to a release lever,
actuatable for simultaneously unwinding both springs to free
the rod for axial movement through the housing. The bushings serve three distinct functions. An axial
bore in each bushing defines a radial bearing surface which
supports the rod for sliding movement through the lock
housing. A radial slot in the bushing receives an end tang of
the spring, to

<CLAIMS>
A mechanical lock (10; 100) of the type comprising a
lock housing (14; 114), a rod (12) axially movable through

said housing, coil spring means (32, 34) tightly wound about
said rod, spring end bearings (52, 54; 152, 154) in said

housing, said spring means being axially captive between
said end bearings for axially locking said rod to said

housing, and release means (46, 48) actuatable for partially
unwinding said spring means thereby to release said rod for

movement through said housing, said
lock housing having a plurality of housing elements (16, 24;

116, 124), characterized by deformable portions (30) for mechanically
interlocking said housing elements, said spring end bearings

being on first and second of said housing elements
respectively; said first and second of said housing elements

being adjustable in an initial undeformed condition of said
deformable portions to permit positioning of said end

bearings relative to each other thereby to tightly contain
said spring means therebetween; said plurality of housing

elements being fixed relative to each other in a final
deformed condition of said deformable portions.
The mechanical lock of claim 1 wherein said deformable
portions (30) comprise portions of one of said housing elements

mated to receiving openings in the other of said housing
elements, at least some of said receiving openings being

oversized to permit said positioning of said end bearings
relative to each other in said undeformed initial condition

of said portions, said housing elements (16, 24) being fixed
against relative movement in a deformed final condition of

said portions.
The mechanical lock according to either claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein said first housing element (116) is secured

to a third housing element (134) by said plurality of
deformable portions, said second housing element (124) being 

interposed between said first and third housing elements and
retained by a subset of said plurality of deformable portions

(30), and further comprising fail-safe means for retaining
said second housing element against separation from said

first and third housing elements in the event of failure of
said subset of interlocking elements due to overload forces

acting on said housing.
The mechanical lock of claim 1, wherein said deformable
portions comprise a plurality of tabs (30) on a third housing

element (134), said tabs (30) extending through slots (132,
136) in said first and second housing elements, said slots

on said first housing element being sized to fix said first
housing element to said third housing element in an axial

direction of said housing, and said slots in said second
housing element being oversized to permit limited movement

of said second housing element in an axial direction of said
housing in said initial condition, all said housing elements

being fixed against relative movement in a deformed final
condition of said tabs (30).
The mechanical lock of claim 4 wherein a subset of said
tabs (30) pass through aligned slots in both of said first

and second housing elements and further comprising an
opening (142) in said first housing element and a stop (140)

on said second housing elements, said stop projecting into
said opening to prevent separation of said first and second

housing elements in the event of failure of said subset.
The mechanical lock of claim 4 or claim 5 wherein said
third housing element has a U-shaped cross-section with

parallel free edges along an open side, said tabs (30)
extending from said free edges.
The mechanical lock according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein said end bearings are integral portions of

said first and second housing elements formed to define
arcuate edges conforming to the circumference of said rod. 
The mechanical lock according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein said housing is dimensioned for closely

containing the outer diameter of said spring means to
transmit said unwinding along said spring means and ensure

fast release of said rod upon actuation of said release
means.
The mechanical lock according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said rod is supported in a

radial direction between said housing elements only by said
spring means.
The mechanical lock according to any of the preceding
claims, wherein said housing consists of a plurality of

housing elements including housing elements having said
spring end bearings and made of stronger but heavier

material and at least one housing element without said
spring end bearings and made of weaker but lighter material,

and load connecting means (60, 62) on said rod and on one of
the housing elements having said spring end bearings.
The mechanical lock according to any of the preceding
claims wherein one of said housing elements contains said

rod and said spring means against separation in a radial
direction from said spring end bearings on others of said

housing elements, and further comprising first load
connecting means on said one of said housing elements and

second load connecting means on said rod, such that said one
of said housing elements is substantially free of working

loads in the axial direction of said rod.
