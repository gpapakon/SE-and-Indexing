<ABSTRACT>
In a device for exhaust-gas recirculation on a combustion chamber (1), to the burner (15), the tube wall (3) has a quadrangular, in particular rhombic, opening (2), along the straight sides of which the tube wall parts (4, 4') are bent outwards, a gusset (10, 10') made up of tube wall parts being arranged in the lower part. These tube wall parts (4, 4') form a suck-back head which is connected to the circulation of the tube wall (3) of the steam generator and is thereby cooled. Connected to this suck-back head via a brick-lined transition piece (7) and an expansion joint (8) is the return pipe (9) for the exhaust gas.

<CLAIMS>
Combustion chamber (1) for a steam generator of a forced or
natural circulation system which is preferably fired by grounddried

coal dust, comprising a welded pipe wall (3) of essentially
vertically extending pipes and a device (11) for waste-gas

feedback with at least one combustion-chamber opening (2)
provided in the pipe wall and a feedback pipe (9) for the waste

gas, 
characterised in that
 the combustion-chamber opening (2)
is designed in the form of a rectangle standing on one corner and

comprising a combustion-chamber neck (16) which is divided by
plane tubular wall sections (4, 4') which are formed by pipes,

which are bent outwards by expanding the division and returned
into the pipe wall (3) whilst establishing a downwardly oriented

opening (5), with a feed (6) for primary air and/or cold gas
provided in the area of the pipe-wall sections (4, 4') in front of the

opening (5), as seen in the flow direction of the waste gas, and

adjacent to the opening (5) and outside the direct radiation area
of the combustion chamber (1) is provided a walled transitional

section (7) to which is connected via an expansion join (8) the
feedback pipe (9) for the waste gas.
Combustion chamber according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the webs which connect the pipes are at least partially
removed during delivery (6) of primary air and/or cold gas for the

purpose of forming openings in the pipe wall.
Combustion chamber according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 gussetted webs are arranged between the pipes in the area
of the pipe-wall sections (4, 4').
Combustion chamber according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the transitional piece (7) is designed as a transition from a
rectangular to a round cross-section comprising an expansion

join (8) which is operative in the axial direction for connecting the
feedback pipe (9).
Combustion chamber according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 gussetted pipe-wall elements (10,10') which determine the 
lower portion of the opening (2) of the pipe wall are arranged

between the lower wall sections (4') which define the opening (5)
and the pipe wall (3).
