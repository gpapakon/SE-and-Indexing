<ABSTRACT>
An agent for promoting the proliferation of 
Bifidobacterium which comprises an indigestible substance which 

is prepared by heating a starch in the presence of a mineral 
acid and a small amount of water to prepare a pyrodextrin and 

hydrolyzing the pyrodextrin in the presence of an acid; and use 
of the indigestible substance for promoting the proliferation 

of Bifidobacterium in the intestine. Foods containing the 
indigestible substance promote the proliferation of 

Bifidobacterium in the intestine and can be very excellent 
health foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for promoting
the proliferation of Bifidobacterium which comprises an
indigestible substance which is prepared by heating a starch in
the presence of a mineral acid and a small amount of water to
prepare a pyrodextrin and hydrolyzing the pyrodextrin in the
presence of an acid; use of the indigestible substance for
promoting the proliferation of Bifidobacterium in the intestine;
and a method for imparting Bifidobacterium proliferation-promoting
effect on a food by adding the indigestible substance
to the food.A hundred kinds of bacteria and a hundred trillions of
bacterial cells live in the human intestine and form an
intestinal bacterial flora. These bacteria proliferate while
ingesting dietary components and components secreted in the
intestine as nutrients and produce various kinds of substances.
The intestinal bacterial flora varies depending on the age of a
subject or as one gets older. For instance, Bifidobacterium is
predominant in the suckling, while anaerobics such as
Bacteroidaceae appear in the weaning period and bacteria form
bacterial flora similar to that observed in the adult. On the 
other hand, an abnormal bacterial flora, which is not observed
in the normal adults, often appears in the aged. More
specifically, there is observed a decrease in the population of
Bifidobacterium and an increase in the population of other
bacteria such as Escherichia, Enterococcus and Clostridium
perfringens. It has been known that such a change in the
intestinal bacterial flora exerts various adverse effects on
the human body and accordingly, it has been believed to be
important that the population of the intestinal bacteria should
be maintained at a condition in which Bifidobacterium is
numerically superior to harmful bacteria such as Clostridium
perfringens.Recently, there have been developed various kinds of
Bifidobacterium-containing pharmaceutical preparations and
dairy products containing the same for the purpose of increasing
the population of Bifidobacterium in the intestine. However, it
has generally been believed that the bacterial cells of
Bifidobacterium orally administered hardly settle in the human
body. For this reason, it would be effective to orally ingest an
indigestible saccharide-containing food which can arrive at the
large intestine without being digested and absorbed and is
used by Bifidobacterium therein in order to increase the
population of Bifidobacterium in the intestine.Nevertheless, most of indigestible polysaccharides such as
cellulose
