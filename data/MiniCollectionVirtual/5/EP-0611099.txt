<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for imparting a positive phase slope (i.e., a 
negative group delay) to a narrowband signals is disclosed which adjuststhe phases 

of the various frequency components of a signal in a manner opposite to that of a 
delay line. The invention also permits the amount of phase slope to be adjusted, 

electronically, without the need for electro-mechanical apparatus or the interchange 
of cables. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention are advantageous in 

that at the center of the operating band they maintain the phase of the delayed signal. 
These results are obtained in an illustrative embodiment of the present invention 

which divides the signal to be delayed into two signals which traverse different 
signal paths (715, 719) and are recombined in a signal combiner (729). The first 

signal path advantageously comprises a gain control block (717). The second signal 
path advantageously comprises a second gain control block (725) and a fixed line 

delay (719) which is not found in the first signal path. The amount of phase slope 
imparted to the signal can be adjusted by varying the gain (or attenuation) of the 

respective gain control blocks (717, 725).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric circuit design in general, and 
more particularly, to methods and apparatus which expedite a narrowband signal. In electronic circuits it is often advantageous to temporally delay a 
narrowband electric signal. Such a delay can be realized by increasing the physical 
path traversed by the signal, thereby altering the phases of the various frequency 
components in an amount proportional to their frequency. In some applications, 
however, it is advantageous to expedite a narrowband signal (i.e., make the signal 
appear to have propagated a shorter distance than it actually did). FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention. FIG. 2 depicts, using vectors, the phase relationship of three illustrative 
sinusoidal components of a narrowband signal at the input to the illustrative 
embodiment in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 depicts, using vectors, the phase relationship of the three 
sinusoidal components of FIG. 2 as they appear on lead 115 in FIG. 1. FIG. 4 depicts, using vectors, superpositioning of the phase relationship 
of the three sinusoidal components of FIG. 2 as they appear on leads 105 and 115 in 
FIG. 1. FIG. 5 depicts, using vectors, the phase relationship of the same three 
sinusoidal components of FIG. 2 as they appear on lead 119 in FIG. 1. FIG. 6 depicts, using vectors, the trigonometry associated with 
analytically summing two vectors. FIG. 7 shows a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention which can adjust the amount of time by which the input signal is 
expedited. FIG. 8 depicts the phase response of the illustrative embodiment shown 
in FIG. 1.  Two embodiments of the present invention are described below. The 
first has a fixed phase slope and the second has an electronically adjustable phase 
slope. FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention which receives a narrowband input signal and imparts to it a 
positive phase slope. In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 1 the negative group 
delay, d, is fixed according to criteria described below. The illustrative embodiment 
advantageously comprises signal divider 103, delay element 109, attenuator 113 and 
summing amplifier 117. Signal divider 103 advantageously receives on lead 101 a narrowband 
input signal having an root-mean-squared amplitude (hereinafter "amplitude") of 
magnitude one and phase defined as zero radians. FIG. 2 depicts, using vectors, the 
phase and amplitude of three illustrative
