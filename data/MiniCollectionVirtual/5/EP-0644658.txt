<ABSTRACT>
A PLL frequency synthesizer is disclosed, which comprises a 
voltage controlled oscillator (20), and a comparison frequency 

divider (13) for dividing a frequency of the output signal 
from the voltage controlled oscillator (20) to output a 

comparison signal. A phase comparator (17) in the synthesizer 
compares a phase of a reference signal to be fed thereto with 

a phase of the comparison signal, and generates a first and 
second phase difference signals, based on its comparision 

result. The synthesizer further includes a charge-pump 
circuit (21) operated based on the first and second phase 

difference signals, and having an output terminal (OT1) 
connected to the voltage controlled oscillator (20). The 

charge-pump circuit includes a first bipolar transistor (T1) 
connected between a high-potential power supply (Vcc) and the 

output terminal (OT1), and a second bipolar transistor (T2) 
connected between a low-potential power supply (GND) and the 

output terminal (OT1). The first and second bipolar 
transistors are controlled based on the first and second phase 

difference signals, respectively. At least one of the first 
and second bipolar transistors is an emitter-follower type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Phase Locked Loop
(PLL) frequency synthesizer circuit which operates to maintain
the frequency of the synthesizer's output signal at a desired
frequency value pre-set by a user, and more particularly to
a charge-pump circuit which is one of the components of the
PLL synthesizing circuit.Recently, PLL frequency synthesizer circuits have found
widespread application in mobile communication devices
such as the cellular or cordless phone. The number of these
devices used by the public has increased dramatically due to
their widespread popularity with the public. With an
increased number of users, it has become necessary to
reduce the area of the phone's effective operation and/or to
execute a time-division process that ensures the effective
time-based usage of a particular frequency used with a
particular signal. Digital signal processing has, in response
to these constraints, made significant inroads in the
technological advancement of mobile communication devices.
With the increased use of digital mobile communication
devices, there is an also a demand to increase the tuning
speed of PLL frequency synthesizer circuits. To effect this
increase in the tuning speed of the PLL frequency synthesizer,
therefore, various techniques have been proposed, the most 
important of which has been to enhance the characteristics of
the charge pump circuit used in the mobile communication
device.Fig. 1 shows a conventional PLL frequency synthesizer
circuit 100. The synthesizer circuit 100 is composed of a
reference counter 111, a crystal oscillator 112, a comparative
frequency divider 113, a phase comparator 117, a charge-pump
circuit 118, a low-pass filter (simply referred to as LPF)
119, and a voltage controlled oscillator (simply referred to
as VCO) 120. The LPF 119 is composed of an integrating
circuit having two resistors R15, R16 and a capacitor C2.The reference counter 111 operates to divide the
frequency of an oscillation signal FOSC, output from the
crystal oscillator 112 at a predetermined frequency in order
to generate a reference signal FR at a reference frequency.
The reference signal FR is output to the phase comparator 117.The comparative frequency divider 113 includes a
prescaler 114, a program counter 115, and a swallow counter
116 for switching a dividing ratio of the prescaler 114. The
prescaler 114 divides a frequency of the signal FVCO output
from the VCO 120 to generate a frequency-divided signal S1.
If the frequency-dividing ratio is expressed by "M", the
prescaler
