<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a restorative composite
dental cement composition, and more particularly, to a
dental cement composition having a substantially high
compressive strength that is suitable for application
with a dental post or as a core build-up material.Dental restorative cement compositions have
achieved wide commercial success and are extensively
used in clinical dental practice. The leading U.S.
patent on dental restorative cement compositions is
U.S. Patent No. 3,066,112 to Bowen, which describes a
dental cement composition that consists of a liquid
polymerizable organic resin matrix and finely divided
inorganic filler materials.As described in the Bowen patent, the liquid
polymerizable organic resin matrix is typically
prepared by combining bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate
with one or more active monomers, preferably
other methacrylates. As part of the system, a catalyst
or initiator is used, such as benzoyl peroxide,
along with a base or polymerization accelerator such
as a toluidine compound. Other ingredients such as
stabilizers, absorbents and pigments may be added to
the composition.Although the compositions described in the Bowen
patent, as well as those described in subsequent
patents and references, are somewhat satisfactory, a
major disadvantage of most prior art composite dental
cement compositions is that they have a compressive
strength when applied which is far from adequate. The
compressive strength of a restorative composite dental
cement composition is important for enhancing the
wearability of the restorative composition. In U.S. Patent No. 5,034,433 to Cohen et al., a
dental cement is described that is suitable for application
with dental posts for post insertion in a tooth
or during core formation. The cement includes titanium
powder which interacts with the polymer matrix
for increasing compressive strength. While the cement
is advantageous, it is nevertheless less than desirable
since the titanium composite is dark colored.Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a
restorative composite dental cement composition having
a high compressive strength whose viscosity may be
varied depending upon the desired dental application.Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention,
a composite dental cement composition containing
a lanthanide series compound is provided. The composite
dental cement composition includes a polymer
matrix in an amount of between about 15 and 50 weight
percent, a filler in an amount of between about 35 and
80 weight percent and a lanthanide
