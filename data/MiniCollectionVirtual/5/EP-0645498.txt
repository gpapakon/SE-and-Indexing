<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) to be fitted through a hole (11) in a wall 
(13), comprises a through housing (24) to support a shower 

delivery head (14) on the outer side of the wall and to 
slidingly guide through the hole in the wall a flexible 

pipe (15) supplying water to the head (14). The through 
housing (24) comprises a lip seal (27) with a central 

passage having an edge tightly adhering to the walls of 
the flexible pipe (15). Disposed before and after the lip 

seal (27) in the through housing (24) are a first (28) and 
a second (29) guide surface, which maintain the pipe (15) 

in a substantially rectilinear configuration so as to have 
an outer wall substantially perpendicular to the plane of 

the lip seal (27) in the area of the pipe traversing the 
lip seal. 
The first surface (28) is advantageously continuous and 
curved towards the delivery head, while the second surface 

is composed of the crests of a plurality of parallel ribs 
(33) protruding into the housing through which the pipe 

passes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a supporting and guiding device
for an extractable shower, and in particular to a support
for installing extractable showers of the type having a
flexible pipe which in its concealed position is housed in
a compartment beneath the installation area.This area can be formed for example by an edge of a bath
tub, wash basin, or the like. In the known technique, use
has long been made of extractable showers which have a
flexible pipe that is unwound through a hole in the
bearing surface. One problem consists of water seeping
through the hole when the shower is in operation in its
extracted position In fact, between the flexible pipe and
the walls of the hole there is always a certain amount of
clearance, necessary to avoid friction which would prevent
the pipe from sliding smoothly through the hole, in
general simply by gravity, when the shower is replaced.A solution most widely used consists in providing means
for collecting the water after it has penetrated through
the passage of the pipe. For example, it has been
suggested to use internal pockets which receive the rolled
up pipe and which at the same time collect the water that
has seeped through. These solutions, which are merely
palliatives, are generally complicated, expensive and do
not eliminate the problems caused by the water stagnating
in the collecting elements.The general scope of this invention is to obviate the 
aforementioned problems by providing a supporting and
guiding element for an extractable shower with a flexible
pipe which inexpensively prevents infiltration of water
from the hole through which the pipe passes.This scope is achieved, according to the invention, by
providing a device, to be fitted through a hole in a wall,
comprising a through housing to support a shower delivery
head on the outer side of the wall and to slidingly guide
through the hole in the wall a flexible pipe supplying
water to the head, characterized in that the
through housing comprises a lip seal with a central
passage having an edge tightly adhering to the walls of
the flexible hose, disposed before and after said lip seal
in the through housing are a first and a second guide
surface maintaining the pipe in a substantially
rectilinear configuration so as to have an outer wall
substantially perpendicular to the plane of the lip seal
in the area of the pipe traversing the lip seal.The innovative principles of this invention and its
advantages with respect to the known technique will be
more clearly evident from the following description
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (10), to be fitted through a hole (11) in a
wall (13), comprising a through housing (24) to support a

shower delivery head (14) on the outer side of the wall
and to slidingly guide through the hole in the wall a

flexible pipe (15) supplying water to the head (14),
characterized in that the through housing (24)

comprises a lip seal (27) with a central passage having an
edge tightly adhering to the walls of the flexible pipe

(15), disposed before and after said lip seal (27) in the
through housing (24) are a first (28) and a second (29)

guide surface maintaining the pipe (15) in a substantially
rectilinear configuration so as to have an outer wall

substantially perpendicular to the plane of the lip seal
(27) in the area of the pipe traversing the lip seal.
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the first guide surface (28) is disposed on the side

of the lip seal (27) towards the delivery head and
comprises a surface (28) curved towards the delivery head

to form a short sliding duct for the pipe which is
disposed close to the upper face of the lip seal (27).
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the second guide surface (29) is disposed on the side

of the lip seal opposite the side towards the delivery
head and comprises ribs (33) circumferentially spaced

apart and lying parallel to the pipe in the housing to
define with their crests the second guide surface (29). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized by
a casing (16) having a hollow shank (17)

extending rearwardly to traverse the hole (11) and
internally define said through housing (24), the shank

being secured to the hole by means of a threaded ring nut
(18) screwed onto it from the inner side of the wall (13).
Device as claimed in claims 3 and 4, characterized in
that the ribs (33) are made in one piece on an

internal wall of a hollow sleeve (32) which is axially
housed in the hollow shank (17).
Device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in
that screwed onto the casing (16) is an upper cap (34)

which is axially perforated to create an extension (25) of
the through housing (24), the extension (25) being shaped

to receive a shank (26) forming the portion connecting the
head (14) to the pipe (15), thereby supporting the head on

the device.
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in
that the curved surface (28) is formed on a discoidal bush

(31) generically disposed parallel to the lip seal (27).
Device as claimed in claims 5, 6 and 7, characterized
in that the cap (34) secures in place, by packing

them, the sleeve (32), the lip seal (27) and the discoidal
bush (31).
Device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in
that fitted on the shank (17), on opposing sides of the

wall (13), are two adapting elements (19, 20) with slanted
surfaces which rest against the wall in order to provide 

the desired degree of inclination of the through housing
(24) with respect to the perpendicular of the wall (13).
