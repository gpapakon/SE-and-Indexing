<ABSTRACT>
Blades (12,35) with tungsten carbide cutting edges (17,36) have a 
surface at a relief angle (α) and a surface at a reverse angle 

(β) at the periphery. A smooth crown is provided at the 
intersection of the surfaces. The crown will be included 

within an overlap of a cooperating offset steel blade (11,31). The 
relief angle (α) may be between about 1 and 3 degrees and the 

reverse angle (β) about ¼ to 1 degree. The crown may have a 
finish of about 2-6 micro-inch
es. The contact between the 
blades during operation provides a polishing or self-sharpening 

effect. The tungsten carbide blades are used in 
rotating shear wheel devices and scissor cutting devices to 

cut tire cord fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to cutting
blades and more specifically to cutting blades and devices
for cutting tire cord fabrics.Cutting or slitting rubberized tire fabric sheet
material is a difficult task. The tire fabric has parallel
steel or fabric cords embedded in uncured rubber. Such
sheets are continuously bias cut to form sections for
building a tire carcass. The blades must be forced together
at relatively high pressures. The steel or fabric cords
are made of multiple strands to provide the required
strength in tire carcasses. Cords may, for example, be
made with multiple thin or small diameter strands of nylon,
polyester or aramide fiber. Steel cords, made from multiple
thin or small diameter steel wire, are extensively
used. Sheets reinforced with steel cord are usually the
most difficult to cut or slit and cause the most rapid wear
on overlapping cutting blades. High speed steel blades
have been extensively used. To improve the performance of
tires, manufacturers have begun to employ high tensile wire
for the steel cord. The high tensile wire has a higher
hardness than previously used steel wire. As a consequence
of the higher hardness, the life of overlapping cutting
blades has been reduced because of the more rapid wear.
The more frequent sharpening obviously increases the cost
of slitting or cutting. Reference is made to prior art document DE-A1-4119813
in which a cutting device is disclosed for cutting sheet
material, more particularly steel corded material. The
device comprises a movable cutter and a counter cutter.
The movable cutter is of metal and at its cutting edge has
two surfaces forming an angle with each other. The movable
cutter is pressed towards the counter cutter with a pressing
force acting transversely to the cutting force. The
counter cutter is bevelled at its cutting surface so that
it has at least three surfaces respectively enclosing
obtuse angles.Reference is also made to prior art document US-A-4414874
which discloses a cutting apparatus for cutting
rubberized fabric with cords disposed therein. The apparatus
comprises a support frame, a carriage mounted on said
support frame for reciprocal movement, drive means connected
to said carriage for reciprocating said carriage, a
cutter support member mounted on said carriage, a cutter
means journaled on said cutter support member for rotation
thereon, power means mounted on said carriage operatively
connected to said cutter means for continuously rotating
said cutter means, said cutter means having a pair of said
sur

<CLAIMS>
A device suitable for cutting tire cord fabrics comprising
first (11) and second (12) rotatable shear wheels

mounted for rotation about spaced apart axes so that the shear
wheels overlap, wherein the

first shear wheel (11) comprises a high speed steel disk
having a square cutting edge (16), the second shear wheel

(12) comprising a circular disk having a side portion (18)
and a peripheral surface both of tungsten carbide, a

smooth, slightly radiused crown being provided on the side
portion of the second shear wheel (12) in the region in which

the shear wheels radially overlap so that the crown faces the overlapping
side portion of the first shear wheel (11) in axial direction, 

the crown being at
the intersection of a relief angle, which extends from the

crown radially inwardly and away from the first shear wheel
(11), and a reverse angle, which extends from the crown,

away from the first shear wheel (11), to the peripheral
surface of the second shear wheel (12), the device further comprising

means for forcing the wheels together in the axial direction.
The device of claim 1, wherein the relief angle is from
about 1 to 3° relative to the plane of said wheel (11) and

the reverse angle is from about ¼ to 1° to said plane.
The device of claim 1 or 2, wherein the crown has a
radius of about 0.002 to 0.006 inches (0.0508 - 0.1524 mm).
The device of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the crown has a
surface finish of about 2 - 6 micro-inches (0.05 to 0.15

micro meters)
The device of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
wheel (12) is of steel and the tungsten carbide ring (17)

is a preformed insert bonded to a slot in the wheel (12).
A scissors cutting device suitable for cutting moving
tire cord fabric comprising a movable upper (31) and a

fixed (35) lower cutting blade,
the upper blade (31) being arranged so that each poortion of

its lower side face can be brought into an overlapping
relationship with the lower cutting blade, the device further

comprising means for forcing the 
overlapping portions of the

blades together in lateral direction, characterised in that the upper blade (31)
is movable about pivots (33, 34),

the lower blade (35) having
a side portion and an upper surface both of tungsten

carbide, a longitudinally extending crown being provided on
the side portion of the lower blade (35) in the region in which the

overlap of the blades can be brought about so that during such overlap
the crown faces the corresponding portion of the lower side

face of the upper blade (31), 
the crown being

at the intersection of a relief angle, which extends from
the crown downwardly and laterally away from the upper

blade (31), and a reverse angle which extends from the
crown, laterally away from the upper blade (31), to the

upper surface of the lower blade (35).
