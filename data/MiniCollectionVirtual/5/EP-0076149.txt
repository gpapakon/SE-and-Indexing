<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus machines a satinized indented surface of 
a predetermined surface roughness on a work roll. Two rows 

of heads (5a,5b), each mounting one or more electrodes 
(10a, 10b) are mounted substantially on either side of the 

rotary axis of the roll for increasing the number of heads and 
thereby reducing the working time. An elongate lead screw 

(8b) is provided at the side of the machining position from 
which roll handling operations take place for permitting 

temporary displacement of the electrode heads (5b, 10b) at 
that side of the roll shaft in unison to a position (50) in which 

roll handling operations are not obstructed, whereby to solve 
the electrode accommodation and access problems caused 

by an increase in the number of the electrode heads.
