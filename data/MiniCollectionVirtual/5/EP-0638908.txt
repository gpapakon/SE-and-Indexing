<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating and purifying a spent solvent 
generated in a nuclear fuel cycle and containing a higher 

hydrocarbon and a phosphate. This method comprises applying 
to the spent solvent a pressure high enough for allowing the 

crystallization of the higher hydrocarbon to thereby 
crystallize the higher hydrocarbon, and separating under 

pressure a resulting solid mainly composed of the higher 
hydrocarbon from a remaining solution containing the 

phosphate in a higher concentration. The remaining solution 
may further be subjected to low-temperature vacuum distillation 

to separate the solution into the phosphate and a 
deterioration product thereof contained in the solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of separating 
and purifying a spent solvent discharged from a solvent 
extraction process in a nuclear fuel cycle, such as a 
reprocessing plant of spent nuclear fuel or nuclear fuel 
manufacturing plant. The present invention can preferably be utilized in 
regeneration and disposal processes of such a spent solvent 
as described above. A solvent prepared by diluting a phosphate, such as 
tributyl phosphate (TBP), and octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoyl 
methylphosphine oxide (CMPO) , with a higher 
hydrocarbon, such as n-dodecane (hereinafter referred to 
simply as "dodecane") and kerosene, is widely used in a 
solvent extraction step of a reprocessing process of spent 
nuclear fuel or of wet recovery process of mixed-oxide fuel 
scrap in a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant. The spent solvent generated in the solvent extraction 
step contains deterioration products, such as dibutyl 
phosphate (DBP), formed as a result of degradation of a 
portion of TBP by an acid, heat, radioactive rays, etc. 
Such deterioration products adversely affect the extraction 
when the spent solvent is recycled for reuse. Therefore,  
 
the deterioration products are removed by alkali washing 
with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or sodium 
carbonate. A radioactive waste containing the deterioration products 
thus removed, such as DBP, is converted into a vitrified 
solid or a bituminized solid by mixing the same with a 
vitrification additive or a bituminization additive. 
However, in order to stabilize a large amount of the sodium 
component incorporated by the alkali washing, it is 
necessary in this solidification treatment to use a large 
amount of these additives. Consequently, the development of 
a method of separating and purifying a spent solvent which 
enables deterioration products, such as DBP, to be removed 
from TBP without using any salts of sodium has been desired 
in the art. On the other hand, methods such as vacuum freeze-drying 
and low-temperature vacuum distillation wherein difference 
in vapor pressure is utilized have been used as a method of 
separating TBP, DBP and dodecane from a spent solvent. 
However, they are disadvantageous in that the treatment 
capacity is small because of the low vapor pressure. 
Consequently, the development of a separation method having 
a large treatment capacity for a spent solvent has been 
desired in the art. Moreover, when a spent solvent is heated under atmospheric 
pressure to conduct distillation into components,
