<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a stabilized 
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) composition in which (i) 

its intact non-degraded subunit is approximately 400,000 in 
molecular weight based on SDS-PAGE analysis; and (ii) are 

contained at least about 50% didecameric or higher KLH 
multimers, based on sedimentation-equilibrium and/or 

sedimentation-velocity ultracentrifugation analyses. The 
KLH composition is stabilized at 4°C by dissolving and 

storing it in an isotonic buffer preferably containing 
calcium and magnesium. It is critical that the KLH not 

have been frozen or lyophilized during its preparation or 
storage. The KLH composition demonstrates enhanced 

immunogenic activity, particularly enhanced anti-tumor 
activity, which is reduced if the KLH is frozen or 

lyophilized. The KLH composition of the present invention 
exhibits enhanced anti-tumor activity in a murine bladder 

tumor model and thereby represents a new and useful anti-tumor 
immunotherapeutic anti-bladder cancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin (KLH) composition that has enhanced 
immunogenic properties, particularly enhanced anti-tumor 
activity against bladder cancer. Specifically, 
the present invention relates to an immunogenic agent 
comprised of KLH formulated to contain >50% 
didecameric or higher KLH multimers that range in 
molecular weight from approximately 8-10 million. The 
immunogenic agent is useful as a cancer therapeutic 
agent and as an adjuvant or carrier protein. For decades it has been known that hemocyanins 
are among the most potent of immunogens. Keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin (KLH; from the primitive gastropod 
mollusc, Megathura crenulata) has been among the most 
widely used and thoroughly studied of these (1-4). 
Thus, a single subcutaneous injection of KLH, without 
adjuvant, will elicit a strong antibody response in 
virtually 100% of animals, including humans.  There are a variety of well-known methods for 
purifying KLH, including differential centrifugation (5), 
gel-permeation chromatography followed by ion-exchange 
chromatography (2) and differential centrifugation followed 
by gel-permeation chromatography (6). Purified KLH that is 
commercially available typically has been either frozen or 
lyophilized after purification. The solution structure of KLH and other mollusc 
hemocyanins has been studied extensively (7-10). Thus, it 
is known that KLH contains glycosylated polypeptide 
subunits with a molecular weight of 400-500,000 that 
assemble to form decameric (10-mer), didecameric (20-mer), 
and larger particles. These multimeric structures have 
been characterized by ultracentrifugation techniques that 
yield sedimentation coefficients of 11-19S for the 
dissociated subunits and 92-107S for the didecameric 
multimers (1,2). It is further known that a variety of 
factors may affect the size distribution of mollusc 
hemocyanins, including KLH (11,12). These factors include 
ionic strength, pH, temperature, pO₂, and the availability 
of certain divalent cations, notably calcium and magnesium. Bladder cancer is the fourth most prevalent human 
malignancy, with about 49,000 new cases and 9,700 deaths 
reported annually (13). Whereas tumors in the bladder 
often can be removed by surgical resection, such treatment 
is not always curative. It has been reported that 50-80% 
of patients whose tumors have been surgically removed will 
develop recurrent invasive disease (14). Thus, there is a 
need for therapeutic approaches not only to treat the 
primary
