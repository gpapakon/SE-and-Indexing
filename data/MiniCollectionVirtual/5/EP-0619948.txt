<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a low density 
baked product in the form of a loaf, cookie or a ready-to-eat 
cereal among other forms and to a method of 
producing these products. The invention is further 
directed to unique no fat baked products and to a ready-to-eat 
breakfast cereal having an extended bowl life. Baked products, breakfast cereals and snacks are 
generally prepared by forming a dough from flour and 
water, shaping the dough and sometimes shaping the 
cooked dough into pieces by extruding, cutting or 
flaking. Generally, expanded or puffed cereals have 
little or no added fat and are not leavened. Puffed or 
expanded cereals generally have a low density and are 
very porous due to the cell structure formed by flashing 
off moisture at the extruder die or during the gun 
puffing stage. The porous characteristic of puffed 
cereals results in a cereal which readily absorbs 
liquids and quickly becomes soggy in milk. Flaked 
cereals, such as corn flakes, are generally of higher 
density than puffed cereals. These flaked cereals 
similarly tend to have a relatively short bowl life and  
 
become soggy within a few minutes after immersing in 
milk. The tendency of conventional cereal formulations 
to become soggy very quickly when immersed in milk has 
typically resulted in limited consumer appeal of the 
products and encouraged efforts to find suitable methods 
of extending the bowl life to ready-to-eat cereals. Conventional cookie formulations become soggy very 
quickly when immersed in milk and tend to disintegrate 
completely. Generally, expanded or puffed cereals 
become soggy in milk in a few minutes but still retain 
some structural integrity such that the cereal pieces do 
not completely disintegrate. In contrast, cookie 
formulations absorb milk quickly and disintegrate. Conventional cookie production generally involves 
preparing a farinaceous dough having a high fat or 
shortening content. The amount of water added to cookie 
doughs is usually only that amount needed to make the 
dough machinable by commercial machines. The high fat 
content and the leavening of the cookie dough may 
contribute to the crumb-like structure, texture and 
flavor of cookies. The high fat or shortening content 
of cookies is one characteristic which distinguishes 
cookies from crackers and expanded or puffed starch-based 
products. Although the reasons are not completely understood, 
the high fat content of the cookie formulation tends to 
correlate to the short bowl life and short 
disintegration

<CLAIMS>
A baked product prepared from a batter comprising 
an edible heat setting, film forming protein, flour, sugar 

and at least one leavening agent wherein said batter is 
shaped and baked to form a low 
density no fat containing 
edible product. 
A product according to claim 1, wherein said edible 
heat setting, film-forming protein is a whippable protein 

selected from egg white, lactalbumin and soy protein. 
A product according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
said film-forming protein is egg white and the baked product 

is in the form of a cookie. 
A product according to claim 1 to claim 2, wherein 
the baked product is a low density no fat cereal. 
A product according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein said film-forming protein is whippable egg white 

containing cream of tartar. 
A product according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein said leavening agent is selected from air, ammonium 

bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate or mixtures of said 
bicarbonates and mixtures of said bicarbonates and 

acidulants. 
A product according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein the batter contains an unmodified starch. 
A method of preparing a crisp low density baked 
product comprising 
(a) whipping an edible heat setting, film-forming 
protein into a stable continuous protein foam; 
(b blending sugar, flour and at least one 
leavening agent into said protein film foam to form a 

batter; 
(c) forming said batter into shaped pieces; and 
(d) baking said shaped pieces to form a low-density 
baked product having a heat set protein film. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the batter 
is formed into cereal size pieces, and said cereal size 

pieces are baked to form a crisp low-density ready-to-eat 
no fat containing cereal having a crisp protein film to 

inhibit sogginess of said baked size cereal pieces in milk. 
A method according to claim 9 or claim 10, wherein 
the edible heat setting, film forming protein is selected 

from egg white, lactalbumin and soy protein. 
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 10, 
wherein said leavening agent is selected from air, ammonium 

bicarbonates, and sodium bicarbonate and mixtures of said 
bicarbonates and mixtures of said bicarbonates and 

acidulants. 
A method according to any one of claims 8 to 11, 
wherein the batter contains an unmodified starch.
