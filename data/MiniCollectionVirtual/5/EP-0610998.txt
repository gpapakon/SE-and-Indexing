<ABSTRACT>
A staring capacitor disconnect scheme for a fluorescent lamp in which 
each starting capacitor shunts one or more fluorescent lamps until all fluorescent lamps 

are ignited. Following ignition of all fluorescent lamps, each starting capacitor is 
effectively removed from the ballast. Preconditioning of the fluorescent lamp filaments 

can be limited to the period of time that one or more lamp loads are shunted by the 
starting capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a fluorescent lamp ballast. A fluorescent lamp ballast for lighting serially connected fluorescent 
lamps typically employs one or more capacitors (commonly referred to as starting 
capacitors) for stating purposes. Each starting capacitor is connected across at least one 
of the serially connected lamps. The voltage produced across the output of the ballast is 
insufficient to ignite all serially connected lamps at the same time. The starting 
capacitor acts as a shunt across the one or more lamps that the capacitor is connected in 
parallel with. A voltage sufficient for ignition of the unshunted lamp can be then applied 
thereto. Once the unshunted lamp has been ignited, the one or more shunted lamps are 
then ignited (i.e. the voltage produced by the ballast being sufficient to ignite these one 
or more shunted lamps). Current spikes produced by the starting capacitor are considered by lamp 
manufacturers to adversely affect lamp life through excessive sputtering of emissive 
electrode material onto the inner walls of the lamp. The sputtered electrode material 
which covers the inner lamp wall reduces lumen output. The starting capacitor also 
redirects a portion of the current away from the shunted lamps resulting in less light by 
the latter. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a fluorescent ballast having 
improved starting properties so as to increase lamp life and maintain nominally rated 
lumen output for a longer period of time. The fluorescent ballast should substantially 
eliminate both current spikes produced by the one or more starting capacitors and 
diverting of current by the one or more starting capacitors away from the one or more 
lamps once all lamps have been ignited. Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, a ballast for 
powering at least two lamp loads serially connected together includes a supply for 
producing an a.c. voltage, a sensing device for sensing when the a.c. voltage has  
 
reached a predetermined or greater level of a.c. voltage, a shunt device for shunting at 
least one lamp load and a switching device responsive to the sensing device for 
controlling when shunting by the shunt device of the at least one lamp loads occurs. Preferably, the shunt device includes a capacitor, the sensing device is a 
bilateral electronic switch and the switching device includes an optocoupler. The lamp 
loads are typically of the fluorescent type. The switching device by controlling when the 
shunt device (e.g. capacitor) shunts
