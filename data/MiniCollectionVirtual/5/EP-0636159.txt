<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a novel flame retarding
additive useful in polyolefin compositions, as well as the
resulting flame retarded polyolefin compositions. The
inventive flame retarding compositions are comprised of a
mixture of two flame retardant additives, a halogenated
bisphenol derivative, for example tetrabromobisphenol A
bis(dibromopropyl ether), also referred to as
"TBBPA-bis(DBP)", and the copolymer of a halogenated vinyl
aromatic, for example bromostyrene, grafted onto certain
polymers, such as polypropylene.Polyolefins have desirable properties for a variety of
applications. For example, polypropylene is a versatile
light weight plastic characterized by low cost, an attractive
glossy surface, and excellent solvent and stain resistance.
Its attractive fundamental properties have spurred its
adaptation to a long list of applications including films,
fibers and molded articles. Its use as a fiber in home,
commercial and institutional settings - as well as its role
in molded parts for electrical applications - have brought
about the need for improved flame resistance.It is known that numerous bromine-based flame retarding
agents can be added to polyolefins such as polypropylene to
achieve desired ignition resistance. Examples of these
additives are decabromodiphenyl oxide,
hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenol A, brominated 
polystyrene, bis(tribromophenoxy)ethane and the like.
However, every one of the effective agents appears to impart
one or more undesirable properties that result in
compositions which are less attractive or acceptable than
non-flame retardant polypropylene. For example, most
bromine-based flame retardants are fairly expensive and add
signficaiitly to the cost of the propylene. Many
bromine-based flame retardants are incompatible with
polypropylene, and over time they exude to the surface,
resulting in an oily or frosty appearance on molded parts.
When spun into fibers, surface blooming flame retardants can
be deposited onto textile handling equipment, building to the
point that production must be stopped for cleaning.Polypropylene is thermally stable at normal processing
temperatures. However, the more efficient brominated flame
retardants contain labile aliphatic halogen which tends to
degrade under standard processing conditions, resulting in
discoloration and corrosion. Also, most brominated flame
retardants with sufficient thermal stability to withstand
high temperature spinning conditions contain the more stable
- but less efficient - aromatic bromine. Besides
