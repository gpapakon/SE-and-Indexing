<ABSTRACT>
A computer system having a suspend/resume capability in addition to 
the normal operating state and the off state. Closure events of single 

momentary pushbutton switch control changes between the normal operating 
state, the suspend state, and the off state, depending on the value of a 

flag. If the flag is set in a certain state, closure events of the 
switch cause the computer system to change back an
d forth between the 
normal operating state and the off state. If the flag is set in a 

different state, closure events of the switch cause the computer system 
to change back and forth between the normal operating state and the 

suspend state. The switch also controls the video subsystem of the 
computer system such that pressing the switch blanks the video display 

terminal giving the user instantaneous feedback of the switch press.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a desktop computer system having a
system suspend/resume capability.Personal computer systems are well known in the art. Personal
computer systems in general, and IBM Personal Computers in particular,
have attained wide-spread use for providing computer power to many
segments of today's modern society. Personal computers can typically be
defined as a desktop, floor standing, or portable microcomputer that is
comprised of a system unit having a single central processing unit (CPU)
and associated volatile and non-volatile memory, including all RAM and
BIOS ROM, a system monitor, a keyboard, one or more flexible diskette
drives, a fixed disk storage drive (also known as a "hard drive"), a so-called
"mouse" pointing device, and an optional printer. One of the
distinguishing characteristics of these systems is the use of a
motherboard or system planar to electrically connect these components
together. These systems are designed primarily to give independent
computing power to a single user and are inexpensively priced for
purchase by individuals or small businesses. Examples of such personal
computer systems are IBM's PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and IBM's PERSONAL
SYSTEM/1 (IBM PS/1).Personal computer systems are typically used to run software to
perform such diverse activities as word processing, manipulation of data
via spread-sheets, collection and relation of data in databases, displays
of graphics, design of electrical or mechanical systems using system-design
software, etc.IBM PS/1s and PS/2s are desktop computers designed to be used at a
single location. For example, in today's society many individuals have
desktop computers at their desks or in rooms dedicated to computer-aided
tasks. Desktop computers are typically set up at a location and used by
one or many users without ever moving the computer.Desktop systems may be classified into networked and non-networked
computer systems. Networked computer systems are part of a larger
computer system and are connected to other computers or servers via local
area networks (LANs) or wide area networks (WANs). Such networks, using 
special interfaces and protocols, allow computers to share data and
programs in an efficient way. Desktop computer systems used in
businesses are typically networked computer systems. Non-networked
computers, on the other hand, are not connected to any other computers.
Data transfer from one computer to another is accomplished by writing
data to flexible diskettes with a computer in one location and

<CLAIMS>
A computer system having a central processing unit (40) a switch
(21); and a power supply control unit (106) in circuit communication with

the central processing unit (40) and the switch (21); a power supply (17)
in circuit communication with the central processing unit (40) and the

control unit (106) and comprising power selection means for selectively
providing system power from an external source to the computer system, the

power supply (17) being operable in a selected one of a first power supply
state and a second power supply state, the power supply (17) changing

between the first and second power supply states in response to the control
unit (106), the power supply control unit (106) changing the power supply

(17) between the first and second power supply states in response to at
least one of a plurality of preselected power supply control events,

wherein one of said first and said second power supply states is a power
supply state corresponding to a suspend state; the computer system being


characterised in that
 it comprises:

means for saving a system state to a non-volatile peripheral
storage medium (31) for storage while said system is in said suspend state;

and
means for saving a suspend flag indicating that the computer system
has been suspended to a non-volatile internal storage medium (96) for

storage while said system is in said suspend state; and
wherein only the switch (21) receives power while said system is in
said suspend state.
