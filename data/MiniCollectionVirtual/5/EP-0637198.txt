<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid standard printed circuit board assemblies (BGA) having mounting brackets (MW) having to be detached from the interior of an apparatus, an adapter (ZW) and its use on mounting brackets (MW) for standard printed circuit board assemblies and in apparatuses having standard printed circuit board assemblies are proposed. The adapter has two limb surfaces which are arranged rigidly at right angles and each have one threaded hole. One of the threaded holes is used for fastening to the mounting bracket (MW), and the other for fastening to a frame (R) of a relevant apparatus. The adaptor displaces the fastening point of the mounting bracket (MW) with the frame (R) of the apparatus to a point on the frame (R) of the apparatus at which detaching and fastening are possible from outside the apparatus.

Adapter (ZW) for standard printed circuit board 
assemblies (BGA) having a mounting bracket (MW), which is 

arranged on a lateral end edge (with respect to the 
insertion direction of the standard printed circuit board 

assembly) of the standard printed circuit board assembly 
perpendicular to the plane in which the standard printed 

circuit board assembly extends, and which has a limb 
which is bent off at right angles away from the standard 

printed circuit board assembly and has a centring and a 
fastening cutout, characterized by two limb surfaces, 

which are arranged rigidly at right angles and of which, 
given an assignment to the limb of the mounting bracket 

in such a way that one limb surface rests in a planar 
manner on the limb of the mounting bracket (MW) and the 

other limb surface extends in a direction which lengthens 
the projected area of the mounting bracket (MW), the 

resting limb surface has a first threaded hole at a point 
opposite the fastening cutout of the limb of the mounting 

bracket (MW) and the non-resting limb surface has a 
second threaded hole. 
Adapter according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the surface area of the two limb surfaces is matched 

to the surface area of the limb of the mounting bracket 
(MW). 
Adapter according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the first and the second threaded hole of the two 

limb surfaces are arranged at a common level. 
Adapter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the resting limb surface has a 

latching element, which engages into the centring cutout,  
 

at a point opposite the centring cutout of the limb of 
the mounting bracket (MW). 
Adapter according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the latching element is formed by a convex projection. 
Use of an adapter according to one of Claims 1 to 
5 together with a mounting bracket for standard printed 

circuit board assemblies as an individual element. 
Use of an adapter according to one of Claims 1 to 
5 in a device having standard printed circuit board 

assemblies, to which are assigned mounting brackets which 
are arranged on a lateral end edge (with respect to the 

insertion direction of the standard printed circuit board 
assembly) of the standard printed circuit board assembly 

perpendicular to the plane in which the standard printed 
circuit board assembly extends, and which have a limb 

which is bent off at right angles away from the standard 
printed circuit board assembly and has a centring and a 

fastening cutout, a threaded hole arranged at a point in 
a rack (R) of the device, which point is assigned to the 

fastening cutout of the limb of the mounting bracket 
(MW), being designed at the said point as an enlarged 

through hole, and a further threaded hole being provided 
in the rack (R) of the device at a point opposite the 

second threaded hole of the adapter.
