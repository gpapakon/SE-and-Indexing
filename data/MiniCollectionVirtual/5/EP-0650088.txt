<ABSTRACT>
An antistatic composition comprises a 
hydrophilic colloid e.g. gelatin and a plurality of 

surface active agents comprising an anionic surface 
active agent and a cationic surface active agent wherein 

at least one of said anionic and cationic surface active 
agents comprises at least one polyoxyalkylene group. 

The accumulation of electrostatic charge on an element 
e.g a photographic element may be prevented by coating a
 
surface of the element with an aqueous dispersion of the 

antistatic composition and drying the coated surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antistatic 
composition and a method of preventing the accumulation 
of electrostatic charge on an element. The composition 
is particularly suitable for use in a photographic 
element. Antistatic compositions have been coated on 
solid surfaces to prevent the accumulation of 
electrostatic charge. Electrical discharges resulting 
from accumulated electrostatic charge can be damaging 
for many reasons. For example, safety can be prejudiced 
where there is a risk of explosion or fire. Some 
products are adversely affected by electrical 
discharges. Electronic products such as integrated 
circuits and semi-conductor devices are sensitive to 
electrical impulses. Electrical discharges in 
photographic elements will fog the photosensitive 
layers. Values of surface resistivity as low as 1012 
ohms/square are generally considered necessary to avoid 
the problems of static discharge and dirt pick-up due to 
the accumulation of electrostatic charge. Values down 
to 10¹¹ or 10¹⁰ ohms/square are desirable to give a 
wider margin of safety. The use of an antistatic composition 
comprising a hydrophilic colloid and a combination of 
surface active active agents in a photographic element 
is known. Examples of such compositions are shown in 
US-A-4 891 307 in which the surface active agent 
combination includes a nonionic surface active agent 
comprising a polyoxyalkylene group.  A shortcoming associated with the use of a 
nonionic surface active agent comprising a 
polyoxyalkylene group is that coatings containing such a 
compound as an antistatic agent lose their low surface 
electrical resistivity after washing or photographic 
processing. The invention seeks to provide alternative 
antistatic compositions. In particular, the invention provides 
antistatic compositions which retain their low surface 
electrical resistivity after washing or photographic 
processing. The invention also provides antistatic 
compositions in which the combination of surface active 
agents providing the antistatic properties also provide 
good coating properties. In accordance with the invention there is 
provided an antistatic composition comprising a 
hydrophilic colloid and a plurality of surface active 
agents characterised in that the surface active agents 
comprise an anionic surface active agent and a cationic 
surface active agent wherein at least one of said agents 
comprises at least one polyoxyalkylene group. The invention also provides a method of 
preventing the accumulation of electrostatic
