<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
method of producing razor blade cutting edges by
coating the blade edge with an aqueous
polyfluorocarbon dispersion and subsequently
heating the polyfluorocarbon. The present
method provides good telomer adhesion and blade
wear yet eliminates the need to utilize
environmentally hazardous solvents.Uncoated razor blades, despite their
sharpness, cannot be employed for shaving a dry
beard without excessive discomfort and pain, and
it is as a practical matter necessary to employ
with them a beard-softening agent such as water
and/or a shaving cream or soap. The pain and
irritation produced by shaving with uncoated
blades are due to the excessive force required
to draw the cutting edge of the blade through
the unsoftened beard hairs, which force is
transmitted to the nerves in the skin adjacent
the hair follicles from which the beard hairs
extend, and, as is well known, the irritation
produced by excessive pulling of these hairs may
continue for a considerable period of time after
the pulling has ceased. Blade coatings were
developed to solve these shortcomings.Granahan et al., U.S. Patent No. 
2,937,976, issued May 24, 1960, describes a
"coated" blade which provides a reduction in the
force required to cut beard hair. The coating
material consists of an organosilicon-containing
polymer which is partially cured to a gel which
remains adherent to the blade. Although these
coated blades met with considerable commercial
success, the coatings ware not permanent and
would wear off relatively quickly.Fischbein, U.S. Patent No. 3,071,856,
issued January 8, 1963, describes fluorocarbon-coated
blades, particularly
polytetrafluoroethylene-coated blades. The
blades may be coated by (1) placing the blade
edge in close proximity to a supply of the
fluorocarbon and subsequently heating the blade,
(2) spraying blade with a fluorocarbon
dispersion, (3) dipping the blade into a
fluorocarbon dispersion or (4) by use of
electrophoresis. Example 2 shows a blade which
is dip-coated with an agueous colloidal
dispersion containing 25% (wt) finely divided
solid tetrafluoroethylene polymer (DuPont's
Teflon Clear Finish). The resulting blade was
later sintered.Fischbein, U.S. Patent No. 3,518,110,
issued June 30, 1970, discloses an improved
solid fluorocarbon telomer for use in coating
safety razor blades. The solid fluorocarbon
polymer has a melting point between 310°C. and
332°C. and has a melt flow rate of from 0.005 to
600 grams per ten minutes at 350°C. The
molecular weight is estimated to

A method of forming a polyfluorocarbon coating on a razor blade
cutting edge comprising the steps of:


(a) subjecting a fluorocarbon polymer powder having an average
molecular weight of at least about 1,000,000 g/mol to a dose of ionizing radiation

of from 20 to 80 megarads to reduce the average molecular weight to from 700 to
700,000;
(b) dispersing the irradiated fluorocarbon polymer in an aqueous
solution which is free of chlorofluorocarbon solvents;

(d) heating the coating sufficiently to adhere the irradiated
fluorocarbon polymer to the blade edge.
A method according to claim 1, where the heating of step (d) is
sufficient to melt, partially melt or sinter the polymer, preferably to melt or partially

melt the polymer.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the fluorocarbon
polymer of step (a) is reduced to an average molecular weight of from 700 to

51,000 g/mol, most preferably to about 25,000 g/mol, by said ionizing radiation.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
fluorocarbon is irradiated in a dry powder form, and preferably the irradiated

fluorocarbon of step (b) has an average particle size of not more than about 100 µm.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the

level of irradiated fluorocarbon dispersed in the aqueous solution of step (b) is (1)
from 0.5 to 2.0% by weight, or (2) from 0.7% to 1.0% by weight.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
fluorocarbon polymer is polytetrafluoroethylene.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
aqueous solution of step (b) includes one of the following features:

Balance number of from 12.4 to 18;
(3) it further comprises wetting agent which has a Hydrophile-Lipophile
Balance number of from 13.5 to 18; or
(4) it further comprises a wetting agent in an amount of at least 5%
by weight of the irradiated fluorocarbon polymer, said wetting agent consisting of

one or more of alkali metal salts of dialkyl sulfosuccinates, soaps of higher fatty
acids, fatty amines, sorbitan mono- and di-esters of fatty acids and their
