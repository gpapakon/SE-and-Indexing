<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for forming profiled hollow workpieces, for example tubes (11), from metal. The workpiece is laid in a press die (12), the internal contour (13) of which corresponds to the shape of workpiece to be produced. After the closure of the press die (12), a pressure medium (16) in the form of solid parts and, in particular, steel balls is forced into the workpiece by means of a plug (24), pressing them against the internal contour of the press die. An upsetting movement of the workpiece (11) is superimposed on the movement of the plug. The pressing in of the plug (24) can take place in two or more steps, the pressure medium (16) being pushed forwards by means of a pressure cylinder (17, 18) between the steps after the retraction of the plug in each case.
