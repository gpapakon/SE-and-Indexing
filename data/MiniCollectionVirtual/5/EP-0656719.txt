<ABSTRACT>
A remote-control apparatus for remotely 
controlling one or more controlled apparatuses includes a 

video camera capable of inputting an image of a controlled 
apparatus and outputting the input image to outside the 

remote-control apparatus, and a controller for controlling 
the controlled apparatus the image of which has been input 

by the video camera, by using a wireless signal. The 
video camera and the controller are disposed in one body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remote-control
apparatus for remotely controlling controlled
apparatuses, such as electrical apparatuses, and an
image input apparatus.Remote-control systems which remotely control
electrical apparatuses, such as in-house electrical
apparatuses, through communication lines such as
telephone lines, are known. In a certain system, a
wireless communication line (employing, for example,
electromagnetic waves, or infrared rays) is disposed
between a telephone set, specifically an automatic
answering telephone set, and a controlled apparatus. A
predetermined control signal (for example, a control
signal in accordance with DTMF (Dual Tone Multi
Frequency)) is transmitted to the telephone set from an
outside place where the user is located, and a wireless
control signal corresponding to the control signal
received by the telephone set is transmitted to the
controlled apparatus. As a result, it is possible to
remotely control controlled apparatuses, such as in-house
air conditioners or baths from an outside place
where the user is located.Of course, by using electromagnetic waves at an
appropriate frequency band, it is possible to remotely
control an arbitrary specific controlled apparatus from
among a plurality of controlled apparatuses in which 
the receiver is at least within a fixed distance from
the telephone set.A wired connection arrangement called a home bus rather
than wireless connection is known. However, in the case
of the wired connection method, a wiring work must be
done beforehand, and there is also a drawback in that
it is difficult to cope with the change in the position
of the controlled apparatus and the expansion thereof.
In contrast, the wireless method has no wiring
requirement and has the advantage of being capable of
flexibly coping with the change in the position of the
controlled apparatus and the expansion thereof.However, in the conventional wireless method, if
directivity is made wider, interference or electric
wave disorder may occur, and a controlled apparatus in
the house next door may be caused to operate depending
on the intensity of the electric waves.To avoid the above problem, infrared rays or microwaves
are usually used at a relatively sharp directivity.
This, however, causes an inconvenience in that the
position at which a controlled apparatus or a telephone
set is installed is limited. Further, when a plurality
of controlled apparatuses are to be controlled, the
receivers of the respective controlled apparatuses must
be disposed on the
