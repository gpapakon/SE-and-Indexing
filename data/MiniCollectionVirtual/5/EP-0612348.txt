<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a series of
novel recombinant heterodimeric proteins useful in the
field of treating bone defects, healing bone injury and
in wound healing in general. The invention also relates
to methods for obtaining these heterodimers, methods for
producing them by recombinant genetic engineering
techniques, and compositions containing them.In recent years, protein factors which are
characterized by bone or cartilage growth inducing
properties have been isolated and identified. See, e.g.,
U. S. Patent No. 5,013,649, PCT published application
WO90/11366 PCT published application WO91/05802 and the
variety of references cited therein. See, also,
PCT/US90/05903 which discloses a protein sequence termed
OP-1, which is substantially similar to human BMP-7, and
has been reported to have osteogenic activity.A family of individual bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs), termed BMP-2 through BMP-9 have been
isolated and identified. Reference for
the purposes of providing disclosure of these proteins 
and methods of producing them is made to co-owned U.
S. Patent No. 6,150,328 and the related
applications recited in its preamble. Of particular
interest, are the proteins termed BMP-2 and BMP-4,
disclosed in the above-referenced patent; BMP-7,
disclosed in US 5,141,905; BMP-5, disclosed in US 5,106,748
and BMP-6, disclosed in US 5,187,076
BMP-8 is disclosed in US 5,688,678. Additional
members of the BMP family include BMP-1
BMP-9, disclosed in US 5,116,738; and BMP-3,
disclosed in US 5,116,738 and PCT publication 89/01464.There remains a need in the art for other
proteins and compositions useful in the fields of bone
and wound healing.In one aspect, the invention provides a method
for producing a heterodimeric protein having bone stimulating
activity comprising culturing a selected host cell containing a nucleotide
sequence encoding a first selected BMP or fragment thereof and a
nucleotide sequence encoding a second selected BMP or fragment
thereof, said nucleotide sequences each being under the control of a
suitable regulatory sequence capable of directing co-expression of said
proteins, and isolating said heterodimeric protein from the culture
medium, wherein said heterodimeric protein is a human BMP-2/5, BMP-2/6,
BMP-4/5, BMP-4/6 or BMP-4/7 heterodimer.According to one embodiment of this invention, 
the host cell may be co-transfected with one or more
vectors containing coding sequences for one or more BMPs.
Each BMP polynucleotide sequence may be present on the
same vector or on individual
