<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printer head has a piezoelectric 
ceramic element (1) with a plurality of ink reservoirs (12) wherein 

at least one side wall (11) of each reservoir is made of a 
piezoelectric ceramic material and has an electrode (13) for 

driving the piezoelectric ceramic element formed on the 
wall. The electrode (13) is covered with an inorganic passive 

state protective film (20), and the protective film (20) has a 
thickness of from 0.1µm to a value smaller than 1/8 of a 

thickness of the wall (11) in maximum or a density of not 
smaller than 1.8g/cm³. The protective film (20) may be formed 

to cover all inner surfaces of each reservoir (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet printer head of 
the type having ink reservoirs wherein at least one of the 
walls of each reservoir is made of a piezoelectric ceramic 
material and is activated by an electrode. US-A-4968992 discloses a method of manufacturing an 
ink jet recording head which uses a thermal generating 
member to create vapour bubbles in the ink so as to eject 
droplets of ink. It is particularly concerned with a 
method of providing a protective layer over the energy 
generating member which does not unduly hinder the thermal 
generation. Ink jet devices making use of piezoelectric 
ceramic elements are known and have been hitherto proposed 
including, for example, drop-on-demand type ink jet 
devices. The device is arranged so that a piezoelectric 
ceramic element has a number of grooves, each individual 
grooves having the capacity to deform due to the 
piezoelectric ceramic material. When the capacity or 
volume of a groove is reduced, ink in the groove is jetted 
from a corresponding nozzle in the form of droplets. When 
the capacity is increased, the ink is introduced from an 
ink introducing pipe into the groove. A multitude of 
nozzles are provided adjacent to one another, so that when 
ink droplets are jetted from given nozzles according to 
given printing information, a desired letter or image is 
formed on a paper sheet provided in face-to-face relation 
with the nozzles. Referring to Fig. 1, a known ink jet device is 
shown. The device includes a piezoelectric ceramic 
element 1 having a plurality of grooves 12 wherein the 
element 1 is polarized in the direction of arrow 4. The 
device also includes a cover plate 2 made of a ceramic or  
 
resin material bonded with the element 1 through a bonding 
layer 3 such as an epoxy adhesive, thus defining the 
plurality of grooves 12 as ink passages. Individual ink 
passages have an elongated shape with a rectangular 
section and each includes side walls 11 extending over the 
entire length of the ink passage. The side walls 11 are 
formed with a metal electrode 13, to which a drive 
electric field is applied, on opposite surfaces thereof 
extending from the top of the side wall in the vicinity of  
 
the adhesive layer 3 at the apex of the side wall 11 
toward the central portion of the side wall 11. Each 
electrode 13 is covered with a protective film 20 as 
shown. Ink is filled in all of the ink passages during 
operation. The operation of the device is illustrated with 
reference to Fig. 2, which is a sectional view of an
