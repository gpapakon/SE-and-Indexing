<ABSTRACT>
Spring clamping band made up of a band of metal (1) wound up on itself, the terminal portions (1a-1b) of the said band each having a width substantially equal to half the width of the band, being located one beside the other and being provided with tabs (2-3), pointing radially towards the outside of the collar, forming bearing surfaces for a tool of the pliers type. Each tab, extending substantially over the entire width of the band has, on the side opposite its connection to the corresponding terminal portion of the band, an extension (2a-3a) which extends over the other terminal portion of the band in the opposite direction from that of the tab carried by this other terminal portion.
