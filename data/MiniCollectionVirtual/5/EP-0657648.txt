<ABSTRACT>
The pump comprises, for operating the pistons (10), a linkage of 
the type provided with a surface (12) rigid with the motion input 

shaft and inclined to the plane perpendicular to the axis of the 
shaft (11), said inclined surface (12) acting with unilateral 

bearing constraints on the rear end of the pistons (10) to 
implement their outward stroke; a plate (20) constrained to the 

rear end of each piston (10) by a bearing constraint which 
subjects the piston (10) to a reaction with a component parallel 

to the piston axis and in the same direction as the return stroke 
of the piston (10); the central portion of the plate (20) rests on 

a fulcrum element (30) coaxial to the shaft (11) and arranged to 
subject the plate (20) to a reaction with a component parallel to 

the axes of the pistons and having the same direction as the 
return stroke of the pistons (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-cylinder reciprocating pump with 
axial pistons of the type in which the piston movement is produced 
by a linkage with a frontal cam defined by a surface rigid with 
the motion input shaft and inclined to the plane perpendicular to 
the shaft axis. This inclined surface acts on the rear ends of 
the pistons via unilateral bearing constraints, so urging the 
pistons to effect their outward stroke. In known pumps of the aforesaid type, the piston return stroke, 
for implementing the suction stage, is produced by the action of 
cylindrical elastic springs associated with the pistons and acting 
by compression. These return springs give rise to various drawbacks which up to 
the present time it has not been possible to overcome. A first drawback is that part of the energy provided by the motor 
is used to compress the springs, with consequent energy wastage. In addition, particularly for pumps of relatively small power, the 
resistance offered by these springs is particularly negative 
towards initial movement, to the extent that it is difficult to 
start the pump if conditions are not completely favourable. Moreover, for pumps operating at high rpm (in excess of 3000 rpm) 
special springs are required capable of very effectively 
responding to the high piston oscillation frequency, such springs 
being of relatively costly manufacture and in addition requiring a  
 
high pre-compression load, resulting in particularly high energy 
loss (as stated). In addition, with prolonged use and time, the 
return springs lose their elasticity to the extent that in the 
long term they no longer operate satisfactorily. An object of the present invention is to provide a pump of the 
aforesaid type which obviates said drawbacks connected with the 
presence of the piston return springs. A further object of the present invention is to improve and 
simplify the means which secure the inclined surface to the rear 
ends of the pistons. A general object of the present invention is to improve the piston 
mechanical efficiency. These and further objects are attained by the present invention as 
characterised in the claims. The invention is shown in detail in the figures, which illustrate 
one embodiment thereof. 
Figure 1 is a side view of the pump with certain parts removed in 
order to show the members relative to the present invention. Figure 2 is a section on the plane II-II of Figure 1. Figure 3 is an enlarged detail of the plate 20 sectioned on the 
plane III-III of Figure 2. Figure 4 shows

constraint which subjects the piston (10) to a reaction with a 

component parallel to the piston axis and in the same direction as 
the return stroke of the piston (10), the central portion of the 

plate (20) resting on the convex surface (31) of a fulcrum element

pistons (10). 
A pump as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
bearing constraint between the plate (20) and each piston (10) 

comprises a spherical cap (21') fixed to the rear end of the 
piston (10) and having its convexity facing the piston, and an 

aperture (24) provided in the plate (24) to define a seat of 
contact with the spherical cap (21'). 
A pump as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
fulcrum element (30) is urged against said plate (20) by elastic 

means (33) the thrust of which is such as to maintain the plate 
(20) in contact with the rear ends of the pistons (10) and to 

maintain these ends in contact with the inclined surface (12). 
A pump as claimed in claim 1, characterised by comprising: 
a plate (41) of antifriction material rigid with the motion input 

shaft (11) and having a flat face facing the pistons (10) which 
defines said inclined surface (12); and slide shoes (42) each with 

a flat face (42') slidable in contact with the inclined surface

relative piston (10) by a ball joint. 
A pump as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that to the 
rear end of each piston (10) there is fixed a second spherical cap 

(21'') with its convexity facing the inclined surface (12), each 
slide shoe (42) having a concavity (42'') facing the pistons (10) 

and mating with the second spherical cap (21'') of the respective 
piston (10).
