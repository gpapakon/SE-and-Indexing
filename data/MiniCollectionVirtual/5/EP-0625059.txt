<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catheters and more 
particularly to means for enabling the position of the 
tip of a catheter to be identified when it is inside a 
patient's body. There are numerous different types of catheter which are 
used for a multitude of medical purposes many of which 
involve the insertion of the catheter into a patient's 
body via, for example, an artery of the patient. An example of such use is disclosed in our earlier 
International Patent Application Nos GB88/00971 
(Publication No WO89/04142) and GB90/00830 (Publication 
No WO90/14601). In those earlier patent applications 
there is disclosed a catheter which has at its distal tip 
(distal with respect to the operating surgeon) an ultrasonic 
transducer array adapted to emit ultrasonic signals 
and to receive their echoes in order to provide an image 
of the interior of the human organ in question, e.g an 
artery which could be inside the patient's heart.  
 Apart from the system disclosed in these two earlier 
patent specifications and the associated catheters for 
use in those systems, there is also the well-known 
balloon type catheter which is used to carry out a so-called 
angioplasty. This operation involves the 
insertion of the balloon catheter into a patient's 
artery, typically through the patient's thigh, and then 
feeding the distal end of the catheter into the damaged 
artery which could be within the patient's heart. 
Typically the damage can consist of so-called plaque or a 
loose part of the inside wall of the artery, as it were, 
hanging down into the artery thus impeding blood flow. In carrying out an angioplasty operation the surgeon will 
need to accurately locate the balloon distal tip of the 
catheter in exactly the right position within the artery 
in relation to the plaque or damaged wall. Furthermore, 
it may be necessary for the surgeon to withdraw the tip 
at least to some extent and then to reposition it in the 
affected area. Considerable skill, and therefore room for error, is 
involved in this accurate positioning of the distal end 
of the catheter.  
 The present invention is concerned with providing means 
whereby the surgeon can more easily locate the distal tip 
of the catheter in the required position within the 
patient or reposition that tip in the required position. It is normal, to provide the proximal end of the catheter 
(proximal with respect to the surgeon) with some kind of 
"handle" by which the surgeon can grip the catheter in 
order to push it into the patient's artery and to

<CLAIMS>
A catheter (1) provided with a guide wire (4) over 
which the catheter can be slid is characterised in that 

the guide wire is provided with a plurality of X-ray 
opaque markers (8) set at regular intervals along the 

length of the wire. 
A catheter as claimed in claim 1 having two sets of 
opaque markers, the markers in each set being 

distinguishable from those in the other set. 
A catheter as claimed in claim 2 in which the first 
set of markers are set substantially 1cm apart from one 

another, and the second set of markers are set 
substantially 5cm apart from one another.
