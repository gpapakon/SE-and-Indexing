<ABSTRACT>
A double ring gas burner, particularly for built-in 
cooking hobs, comprising an injector support cup (2) on which 

a burner body (36) is removably applied, with an axial duct 
(38) inserted in said cup (2) in a position facing a gas 

delivery nozzle (12) fitted to the cup base, and a flame 
divider element (56) positioned in an annular seat (54) 

provided in the rim (40) of said body (36), characterised by 
further comprising: 


a disc-shaped element (50) rigid with the burner body for 
upperly closing the cup (2), the side wall of which 

comprises apertures (24) for intake of primary air, said 
apertures being placed below the cooking hob when said 

burner body is applied to it, 
a plurality of radial channels (52) connecting the axial 
duct (38) of the burner body (36) to the annular seat (54) 

for the flame divider element (56), 
a plurality of passages connecting the space overlying said 
disc-shaped closure element (50) and bounded externally by 

the rim (40) of the burner body to the space overlying the 
cooking hob (6) external to said rim.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double ring gas burner 
particularly for built-in cooking hobs. Double ring gas burners are known comprising a cup of 
overall cylindrical shape, a burner body positioned on said 
cup and partly housed therein, and an annular flame divider 
provided in its outer edge and inner edge with two series of 
apertures through which a combustible gas-air mixture is 
delivered. The gas is fed by a nozzle positioned on the base 
of the cup, the air (primary air) being drawn in through 
ports situated above the cooking hob and kept separated from 
the secondary air by a horizontal baffle which prevents the 
dirt inevitably formed in the hob from entering the cup. In addition, both the passages for the primary air and 
the passages for the secondary air which feeds the inner ring 
of the burner require for this purpose to project a certain 
extent above the hob, with possible problems of a technical 
nature in the positioning of the pan support grid and the 
application of a closure cover to said hob, in addition to 
possible detriment to apperance. Finally, drawing in primary air from above the hob can 
be difficult if other burners present therein are 
simultaneously in operation. The aforesaid drawbacks are practically absent in  
 
traditional pipe burners, which however suffer from drawbacks 
of another kind and in particular do not allow the gas 
delivery nozzle to be extracted from above without opening up 
the cooking hob. An object of the invention is to provide a double ring 
gas burner, particularly for built-in cooking hobs, which has 
the advantages of known double ring burners of pipe and cup 
type, while at the same time eliminating their respective 
drawbacks. A more particular object of the invention is to provide 
a double ring gas burner which allows easy extraction of the 
gas delivery nozzle from above without having to open up the 
hob. A further object of the invention is to provide a double 
ring gas burner which is practically insensitive to the 
presence of other burners in operation on the same hob. A further object of the invention is to provide a double 
ring gas burner in which the entry of dirt into the burner 
cup is practically eliminated. A further object of the invention is to provide a double 
ring gas burner comprising an ignition spark plug and safety 
thermocouple, both withdrawable from above. A further object of the invention is to provide a double  
 
ring gas burner in which the thermocouple and spark plug do 
not represent an obstacle to the

A double ring gas burner, particularly for built-in 
cooking hobs, comprising an injector support cup (2) on which 

a burner body (36) is removably applied, with an axial duct 
(38) inserted in said cup (2) in a position facing a gas 

delivery nozzle (12) fitted to the cup base, and a flame 
divider element (56) positioned in an annular seat (54) 

provided in the rim (40) of said body (36), characterised by 
further comprising: 


a disc-shaped element (50) rigid with the burner body for 
upperly closing the cup (2), the side wall of which 

comprises apertures (24) for intake of primary air, said 
apertures being placed below the cooking hob when said 

burner body is applied to it, 
a plurality of radial channels (52) connecting the axial 
duct (38) of the burner body (36) to the annular seat (54) 

for the flame divider element (56), 
a plurality of passages connecting the space overlying said 
disc-shaped closure element (50) and bounded externally by 

the rim (40) of the burner body to the space overlying the 
cooking hob (6) external to said rim. 
A burner as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the edge of the disc-shaped element (50) comprises a step 

 
complementary to the upper edge of the cup (2), to stabilize 

their mutual positioning. 
A burner as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the lower surface of the body (36) and the upper edge of the 

cup (2) comprise notches (32) and appendices (34) which 
mutually engage to secure their mutual angular positioning. 
A burner as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the side wall of the cup (2) is provided with an enlarged 

portion (26) in which a seat is formed for the insertion from 
above of a flame control thermocouple (10). 
A burner as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 
the position of the seat for the thermocouple (10) is such 

that said thermocouple is situated in proximity to the inner 
ring of the burner.

passage of the thermocouple (10) when inserted in its seat in 
the thickened portion (26). 
A burner as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 
the side wall of the cup (2) is provided with an enlarged 

portion (28) in which a seat is formed for the insertion from 
above of a spark plug (30) for igniting the burner. 
A burner as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that 
 

the position of the seat for the spark plug (30) is such that 
said seat is situated in proximity to the inner ring of the 

burner. 
A burner as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that
