<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and
apparatus for the production, particularly domestic
production, of beverages, particularly mineral water of
desired characteristics.Certain beverages are known to be produced
industrially from appropriately conditioned mineral water
to which natural and/or synthetic flavourings are
added, and also domestically using drinking water from
the public mains.The drinking water supplied by the water mains
normally presents a disagreeable taste due to the
conditioning substances added to it, and not
infrequently is also dangerous to the health by virtue
of containing pollutant substances such as atrazine.The above problems are only partly solved by
home-made drink making apparatuses, which are normally
based on ion-exchange resins and filters. These, 
however, eventually lose their effectiveness, and may
indeed harbour bacteria in the form of pollutants
accumulated in the filters and resulting in the
formation of stagnant pockets.In the processes according to
FR-A-1389616, the polluted
water is firstly distilled, then condensed and
remineralized by percolating the distillate onto a block
of mineral salts.
GB-A-118482 and
CA-A-1214746 concern standard distilation techniques.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a process and apparatus for the production,
particularly domestic production, of beverages, designed
to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, and which
provides for both long-term reliability and troublefree,
low-cost production.According to the present invention, there is
provided a process for the production, particularly
domestic production, of beverages from an aqueous
influent of any composition, comprising stages
consisting in:
demineralizing said aqueous influent by
distillation; sterilizing the distillate formed in said
demineralizing stage; andremineralizing said distillate by forming a
solution of the same and a mineral additive of a
predetermined composition; characterized in that said
distillate is formed by removing respective overhead and
bottom products of said distillation.According to the present invention, there is also
provided an apparatus for the production, particularly
domestic production, of beverages from an aqueous
influent, as claimed in claim 8.A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention
will be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig.1 shows a schematic view of an apparatus for
producing beverages in accordance with the present
invention;Fig.2 shows a schematic
