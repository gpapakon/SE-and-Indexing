<ABSTRACT>
A broaching tool (10) has a plurality of cutting teeth (22) for broaching a small, deep hole with high precision and surface finish. Three to eight teeth (22) are engaged in the hole for cutting at any one time. For broaching sticky metals such as stainless steel, each cutting tooth (22) has a face angle, backoff angle and rise which are sufficiently large to prevent thermal hardening of the hole surface. A ring (22c) is provided between the front face and land (22a, 22b) of each cutting tooth (22), and has a width selected to prevent formation of axial and ring-shaped tool traces. V-shaped notches (30) having a large radial angle and a small backoff angle are formed in the land (22b) of each cutting tooth (22) to break chips and prevent clogging. The tool (10) further includes a rear pilot (24) having a plurality of smoothing teeth (26) with a diameter larger than the finished diameter of the hole. A set of rough and fine broaching tools can be provided, with the fine tool being processed to convert it to a rough tool when it is worn beyond tolerance. A lubricant/coolant including molybdenum disulfide powder dispersed in a liquid suspension is coated on the tool (10) during broaching.

<DESCRIPTION>
HIGH PRECISION, HIGH SURFACE FINISH BROACHING METHOD, TOOL,AND UJBRICANT/COOLANTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to the art of machining, and more specifically to a broaching method, tool and lubricant/ coolant for forming small, deep holes with high precision and surface finish.Description of the Related ArtMachining of small , deep holes with high precision and surface finish is a problem which has persisted in the art. A small deep, precise hole can be defined as having a diameter of less than 12 millimeters, aspect (depth/diameter) ratio of at least 5 , precision of ISO standard H6-H7 , angular tolerance of H6 , surface roughness of 0.4-0. 1 micrometer, and bore out-of -roundness, cylindri¬ cal out-of-roundness and taper which are within 1/2-1/3 of the tolerance.Prior art methods for machining small , deep holes include drilling and expanding followed by rough and fine reaming, rough and fine boring, or boring and grinding.Other methods include honing and electron discharge machining (EDM) . These prior art methods suffer from the drawbacks of multiple complex machining processes , extreme difficulty in obtaining satisfactory precision, surface 

finish and exchangeability, low productivity, poor quality control, high reject rate and often conical deformation at the exit ends of the holes.Broaching is a process for machining holes, slots and grooves with high productivity compared to the methods described above. Broaching can be used for forming holes in numerous metals including low-carbon steel, low-carbon alloy steel, phosphor bronze, pure aluminum, stainless steel, titanium alloys and other materials. A broaching tool generally includes an elongated body on which a number of parallel cutting teeth are formed or attached. The diameters of the teeth progressively increase from the front end to the rear end of the tool by an increment known as the "rise", such that each tooth cuts slightly deeper than the previous tooth.A basic broaching tool and method are described in U.S. Patent No. 1,945,535, entitled "BROACHING TOOL", issued Feb. 6, 1934 to B. Schlitz. A method of fabricating a basic broaching tool is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,498,361, entitled "BROACH MANUFACTURING METHOD", issued Feb. 12, 1985 to W. Grace.Broaching as practiced conventionally has not achieved its potential for forming small, deep holes with high precision and surface finish. This is due to a number of fundamental problems which have remained unsolved.As the
