<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a combination of a semi-mounted reversible plough (10) and a seed preparation device (11) which are towed behind a tractor in order to carry out a ploughing action and a seed preparation action during a single pass over the ground, in which the plough has a short leading towing beam (12) provided with a forward hitch (13) for coupling the plough to the rear of the tractor; a long towing beam (15) coupled with beam (12) and forming a rearward prolongation thereof; a carrying beam (20) coupled with long towing beam (15) and carrying pairs of reversible plough bodies (23) alont its length; a cylinder operated crank mechanism (17, 18) operable to rotate towing beam (15) and carrying beam (20) as a unit about the longitudinal axis (19) of beam (15) in order to reverse the position of the plough bodies; a coupling beam (24) mounted at its forward end via a mounting beam (43) on the carrying frame (20) and towing beam (15) and projecting laterally therefrom; a swivel connector (25) at the trailing end of coupling beam (24) which is attached to the leading end of a draw bar (41) of the device (11); and a cylinder operated parallelogram linkage (24, 29) which can be operated in order to initiate relative lateral displacement to take place between plough (10) and device (11) during forward movement of the combination, followed by pivoting of the carrying beam (20) and towing beam (15) about the longitudinal axis (19) during reversal of the plough bodies (23) which is permitted by the swivel connector (25), and which takes place during movement of the combination over the headland prior to a return pass over the field to be ploughed and prepared. Preferably, a seed unit (34) is coupled with the seed preparation device, so that ploughing, soil preparation and seeding can take place during a single passage across a field, and the entire combination can automatically adjust itself during reversal of the plough bodies and turning of the combination in the headland.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combination of a reversible plough
and a seedbed preparation device, such combination being
intended to drawn behind a tractor or other propelling vehicle
and to carry out in a single pass a ploughing and seedbed
preparation action to make the soil ready for subsequent seed
drilling.A combination of a plough and a seed preparation device, such
as a packer is known and has the advantage of enabling the
ground (which usually will comprise untilled ground such as
straw stubble) to be both ploughed and then prepared ready for
seeding in a single operation. This reduces the labour time
cost of preparing the ground and also total tractor time as
compared with previous practice of first ploughing the ground
and then following this with preparation of the ploughed
surface in a separate and subsequent operation.However, many existing combinations are relatively simple and
merely comprise a temporary hitching together of a seedbed
preparation device such as a packer to the rear of a trailed
plough so that the packer follows the plough rather in the
manner in which a trailer follows a tractor i.e. the hitching
together is a simple type of pivot hitch which has to be
uncoupled at the end of each series of ploughed furrows before
the tractor and plough turns in the headland the plough bodies
are reversed, and then the packer is re-coupled to the rear of
the plough frame for a return pass along the field.In this simple and relatively unsophisticated existing design,
the packer usually has two separate hitching points, one of
which is coupled to the rear of the plough frame for travel in
one direction, and the other of which is coupled to the rear of
the plough frame for travel in the return direction. The
packer therefore has to have one of its two hitches uncoupled
just short of the headland each time, and the packer then
remains parked in this position while the tractor and plough 
turn round and the plough bodies are reversed before the
hitching point at the rear of the plough frame can be brought
into register with the other of the hitches on the packer.
This is an inconvenient and a time consuming task which has to
be carried out each time the combination reaches each headland
and it would be a clear technical advantage if a design of
combination could be developed which enables the two trailed
components (plough and seedbed preparation device) to remain
coupled together during movement of the combination over the
headland.With a view to avoid the necessity to uncouple the seedbed
prep

<CLAIMS>
An integrated combination of a semi mounted
reversible plough (10) and a seedbed preparation device (11),

said combination being intended to be drawn behind a propelling
vehicle in order to carry out a ploughing action on the ground

and also seedbed preparation during a single pass over the
ground, in which:


the plough (10) comprises

a towing frame (12, 15) having a forward hitch (13) for
coupling the plough to the rear of the propelling

vehicle;
a carrying beam (20) mounted on the towing frame (12, 15)
and having pairs of reversible plough bodies (23) mounted

at spaced apart positions along the length of the
carrying beam; and,
means (21, 22) mounting the carrying beam (20) on the
towing frame for adjustment of the carrying beam between

a first working position in which one of the plough
bodies of each pair (23) is in a ploughing position and

a second working position in which the other plough body
of each pair (23) is in a ploughing position;

wherein the seedbed preparation device (11) is coupled with the
plough (10) so that the device (11) can be towed behind the

plough (10) in order to carry out seedbed preparation on the
ploughed ground when the plough bodies are in the first or the

second working position; and
the seedbed preparation device (11) is coupled with the
carrying beam (20) of the plough (10) via a coupling beam (43,

24) mounted on the carrying beam (20), at a mounting position
(4) intermediate the foremost and rearmost pairs of plough

bodies (23) and which beam extends laterally outwardly and
rearwardly of the mounting position (44);


the coupling beam comprising

a forward support beam (43) which is pivotally
mounted on the carrying beam (20) at said mounting

position, and a rear beam (24) which includes a
parallelogram linkage (24, 25, 26, 27) which is 

adjustable in order to initiate relative lateral
displacement to take place between the plough and

the seedbed preparation device (11) by allowing the
rear beam (24) to pivot relative to the forward

beam (43) about a pivot connection between forward
beam and rear beam; the parallelogram linkage

being adapted to allow the seedbed preparation
device (11) to be laterally displaced relative to

the plough to a reversal position substantially
rearwardly of the plough;
the integrated combination further comprising
a swivel connector (25) which connects the trailing end of the
coupling beam (24) to the seedbed preparation device (11) and

which allows adjustment movement of the carrying beam (20)
between the first and second working positions so that the

device can be adjusted to follow the plough bodies for each
adjustment of the plough bodies;
the swivel connector (25) being adapted to allow rotation of
the coupling beam (24) substantially about the axis of the

towing frame (12, 15) when the seedbed preparation device (11)
is in the reversal position;

Characterised in that:
the swivel connector (25) is adapted to allow part of the
weight of the plough to be transferred from the coupling beam

(43, 24) to the seedbed preparation device (11).
A combination according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the towing frame (12, 15) comprises a relatively short

leading beam (12) which is provided with said forward hitch
(13), and a longer towing beam (15) on which said carrying beam

(20) is mounted, said longer towing beam (15) being coupled
with the leading beam (12) in such a way that the towing beam

(15) and the carrying beam (20) coupled therewith are pivotable
as a unit about the longitudinal axis (19) of towing beam (15)

in order to reverse the position of the plough bodies. 
A combination according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in
which the seedbed preparation device (11) comprises a packer.
