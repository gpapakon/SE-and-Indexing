<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and to a computer system arrangement for producing a dialogue between a central computer unit (C) and at least one user unit (Ai). The user unit (Ai) includes at least one display means (1) and a memory means (4) and can be connected to the central computer unit (C). The central computer unit (C) includes a central memory means (6) in which there is stored a software part, called the dialogue part (DD), which is intended for data processing requested by the user unit (A1). Information concerning text and/or picture for presentation on the display means (1) is pre-stored in the user unit memory means (4) and separate user units (A1, A2) may be of different types. The information transmitted from the central computer unit (C) to the user unit (Ai) during a dialogue session includes at least one first identifier which corresponds to a message to be transmitted, wherein the first identifier points out a presentation object which corresponds to the message in the user unit memory means (4). The presentation object presents the message in different forms, according to the type of user unit concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a computer system 
arrangement for reducing the amount of information that 
need be transmitted between at least two separately 
stored parts of an application. The following is a list of expressions used in the 
present document and their meaning: 
centralised computer systema computer system in which a 
central unit controls all 
other units; decentralised computer systema computer system in which the 
user units have the same controlling 
power as the central 
unit; interpretera program which is able to convert 
one data structure to 
another data structure terminala unit which has little or no 
processing capacity user unita unit via which a user can 
have services performed, such 
as a terminal, personal comput 
er or workstation, for instance. central unita central computer unit which 
serves different users. In multiterminal systems, i.e. centralised computer 
systems which comprise a central computer and a plurality 
of terminals connected thereto, all information  
 
required for an application that involves cooperation between 
a terminal and the central unit has traditionally been 
transmitted through the connection between the central 
computer and the terminal concerned, without taking measure 
to reduce the quantity of information that needs to be 
transmitted. In decentralized computer systems, ie systems in which the 
user units are comprised of personal computers or 
workstations instead of terminals, an application is not 
normally divided for coaction with a central unit. In those 
cases where division has been made, for instance in the case 
of data-base based applications in which data base 
information has been transmitted from the data base to the 
user unit for temporary, individual processing in the user 
unit, some attempts have been made to reduce the quantity of 
information that need be transmitted, for instance by 
compressing and decompressing the data quantity. However, 
with those applications which have been divided into several 
parts and these parts stored in different physical units, the 
problem that large quantities of information must be 
transmitted in the communication link between the units still 
remains. In EP-A-0121071 there is disclosed a data processing system 
and method for the distribution of information to user units. 
Identifiers are used, reducing the amount of information 
transmitted from the host, and the transmitted identifier is 
chosen in accordance with the respective end user. In US-A-4484304 there is also
