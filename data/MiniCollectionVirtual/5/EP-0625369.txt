<ABSTRACT>
Process for removing nitrogen monoxide present in gaseous effluents originating from organic synthesis plants making use of oxidation reactions using nitric acid, by catalytic destruction at high temperature on catalysts based on H-mordenites or ammonium mordenites, preferably iron-, cobalt- or bismuth-ammonium mordenites. Application to the effluents from manufacture of adipic acid, of glyoxal or of glyoxylic acid by nitric oxidation processes.

<CLAIMS>
Process for lowering the nitrous oxide content 
in the gaseous effluents which contain from 30 to 80 % 

thereof by catalytic destruction on zeolite catalysts, 
characterized in that the active substance of the 

catalyst is a mordenite-H or an ammonium mordenite, the 
sodium content of which is lower than 1,000 ppm. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the mordenite-H or ammonium mordenite is a mordenite 

with small pores. 
Process according to either of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that the mordenite-H or ammonium 

mordenite is a mordenite from which alumina has been 
removed. 
Process according to one or other of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the active substance in the 

catalyst charge is a mordenite-H or an ammonium mordenite 
partly exchanged with one or more metals, in particular 

V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Bi. 
Process according to one or other of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the active substance in the 

catalyst charge is an ammonium mordenite partly exchanged 
with iron. 
Process according to one or other of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the active substance in the 

catalyst charge is an ammonium mordenite partly exchanged 
with cobalt. 
Process according to one or other of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the active substance in the 

catalyst charge is an ammonium mordenite partly exchanged 
with bismuth.  

 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the gases from which it is desired 

to remove nitrous oxide additionally contain nitrogen 
oxides NO
x
 in proportions that can reach 5,000 ppm. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that it is carried out in an exchanger-reactor 

of TVA type. 
Application of the process as described in 
Claims 1 to 9 to the treatment of the gases originating 

from the manufacture of adipic acid by nitric oxidation 
of cyclohexanol. 
Application of the process as described in 
Claims 1 to 9 to the treatment of the gases originating 

from the manufacture of glyoxal by nitric oxidation of 
acetaldehyde. 
Application of the process as described in 
Claims 1 to 9 to the treatment of the gases originating 

from the manufacture of glyoxylic acid by nitric oxidation 
of glyoxal.
