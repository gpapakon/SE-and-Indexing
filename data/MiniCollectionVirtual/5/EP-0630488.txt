<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to eyewear frames
and, more particularly, relates to the use in
eyewear frames of an integral front, hinge and
temple piece composed of a wire exhibiting super-elastic
properties.A conventional eyewear frame generally includes
a pair of rims each holding a lens, a bridge for
connecting the rims and a pair of temples or ear
stems connected either directly or indirectly to the
rims through the use of a conventional "pivotal"
hinge. The hinge typically consists of two
interlocking pieces, one attached to either a rim or
a brow member attached to the rim and the other
attached to the temple or ear stem, which are
connected in a tongue and groove relationship by a
conventional fastener, typically a screw.Conventional hinges have been used since the
development of the first eyewear frames for
corrective lenses. While there have been many
improvements to the hinge or hinge assembly
mechanism, these hinges still rely substantially on
the tension created by the fastener to maintain the
integrity of the connection. A common problem
experienced with conventional hinges is the tendency
for the fastener to become loose during normal wear
or to exhibit other mechanical failure resulting in
movement of the entire frame on the wearer's head or 
total failure of the frame itself. It is a common
occurrence to have the fasteners in conventional frames
"tightened" by professionals in order to maintain a
comfortable and secure fit of the eyewear frame on the
wearer's head.In the past, thread-locking adhesives and
mechanical deformation of the fastener end (peening) have
been used to help secure the fastener within the hinge
assembly. However, this has not proved to be entirely
satisfactory due to the additional processing steps and
costs associated with these approaches. The approaches
have also been found to have a limited life and often
result in servicing problems due to the difficulties in
adjusting the frame once the fastener has been secured.In accordance with the present invention there
is provided an eyewear frame comprising an integral frame
piece having a pair of lenses connected thereto, said
integral frame comprising a brow portion, two temple
portions disposed at opposite ends of said brow portion
and a hinge portion connecting each temple portion to the
brow portion, and said integral frame piece being a
continuous metallic wire, characterized in that said
continuous metallic wire has super-elastic properties
defined as being a material which when stressed is able
to recover fully
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An eyewear frame (10) comprising an integral
frame piece (20) having a pair of lenses (12,14)

connected thereto, said integral frame comprising a brow
portion (24), two temple portions (22,26) disposed at

opposite ends of said brow portion and a hinge portion
(23,25) connecting each temple portion (22,26) to the

brow portion (24), and said integral frame piece (20)
being a continuous metallic wire, characterized in that

said continuous metallic wire has super-elastic
properties, defined as being a material which when

stressed is able to recover fully to its initial
prestressed shape upon removal of the stress and which

exhibits immediate stress recovery upon unstressing,
selected such that each said temple portion (22,26) is

movable by means of its associated hinge portion (23,25)
between a normal wearing position and a closed position

in which the temple portion (22,26) is from 5°-15°
relative to said lenses (12,14).
An eyewear frame according to Claim 1, wherein
each temple portion (22,26) includes an end (21,27) which

is adapted to partially fit around the ear of the wearer.
An eyewear frame according to Claim 2, wherein
each of said temple ends (21,27) is formed of said

metallic wire having super-elastic properties.
An eyewear frame according to any preceding
claim, further comprising front lenses connected to said

integral frame piece (20) at said brow portion (24).
An eyewear frame according to any preceding
claim, wherein said metal wire is a metal alloy selected

from Au-Cd, In-Tl, Ti-Ni, Cu-Zn, Cu-Al-Ni, Cu-Zn-Sn,
Ag-Cd and Au-Cu-Zn. 
An eyewear frame according to Claim 5, wherein
said metal wire is a nickel-titanium alloy containing

from 49-52 atomic % Ni, 51-48 atomic % Ti and optionally
from 0.01-5 atomic % of Cu, Cr, Co or V.
An eyewear frame according to any preceding
claim, wherein said metal wire is able to withstand

greater than 7% strain prior to fracture.
