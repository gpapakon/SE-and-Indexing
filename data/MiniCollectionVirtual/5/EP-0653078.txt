<ABSTRACT>
Complex industrial processes are involved for example in the operation of a nuclear power station, in particular in emergency situations. A digital computer which implements by means of its program so-called automatic agents which interact with sensors or regulators is a prerequisite. Process information is obtained or the process is influenced by the activities of the automatic agents (programmable controllers) and operators, progress in carrying out activities being marked by actions. In detail: a) information supplied by the programmable controllers and operators is collected in a protocol of the computer (both the history of plant behaviour and that of actions are acquired in the protocol); b) a number of specifications of activities contain process descriptions which describe which actions in which types of situations (situation types) can be triggered when carrying out the activity concerned; c) a comparator unit compares the situation types with the real situation indicated by the protocol and ascertains whether the given situation corresponds to a situation type from which action possibilities are derived; d) each specification of an activity contains a number of references to information for carrying out the activities (implementation information), aimed at the programmable controllers or operators. A process control system for implementing such a method is disclosed.

A method of controlling, monitoring and regulating
a process in an industrial plant, in particular a

complex industrial process such as plant management in a
malfunction situation in a nuclear power plant wherein


a) robots (3) provided as a computation program and/or
operators interact with sensors and actuators which

are coupled to the process and which provide
process information and influence the process;
b) information about how the values of process
parameters develop and which actions are triggered

by the robots (3) and the operators (2') are
collected in a log (6'), i.e. both the history of

the performance of the process and the history of
the actions are recorded in the log;
c) a set of specifications is made available which

c1) indicate which actions (4', EB1) are suitable to be
triggered for which types (5.1') of situations, the

types (5.1') referring to the history of the
process and/or to the history of the actions and
c2) in each case contain a set (9') of references to
information for the execution of the actions (4',

EB1) which are directed to the robots (3) or
operators (2');
d) in a comparator unit (7) the stated types (5.1) of
situation are compared with the current situation

indicated by the respective log (6') and it is
ascertained whether the given situation (6')

corresponds to a type (5.1') and action
possibilities are derived therefrom.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that


a) the log (6') is constructed from events which arise
as a result of the noting of actions; 
b) by means of the situation types (5.1') contained in
the sequence descriptions (5', 40), 
sets of
conditions are logically coupled to one another,

which conditions refer to the presence of a type of
event in the log (6') or define such a type;
c) for each condition of a situation type (5.1') the
comparator unit (7) checks for the presence in the

log (6') of the event type thus described and,
using the logic couplings of the conditions,

automatically makes statements about the
possibility of corresponding actions in the current

situation predetermined by the log (6'); and
d) supplementary background information (10') is
linked to the execution information (9') in such

manner that the robots (3) or operators (2') reach
the background information (10') commencing from

the execution information (9').

output devices) with the other robots (3) and/or
operators (2'), i.e. indications of actions triggered by

these are fed into the common log (6') or stored
information is called up so that the operators (2')

and/or robots (3) can mutually inform one another of
action possibilities relevant to them.

list of events classified in accordance with notation

was noted in the log; time period (22) in which the

event took place; operator or robot (2', 3) or in
general terms agent (23) who/which has triggered the

action and caused the event to be noted; activity (24)
with which the action is associated; phase (25) in which

the execution of the activity has occurred and which
reproduces the type of the action; plant parameter (26)

about which the activity has possibly gained knowledge;

part (31a, 34; P3'), where each part contains a set of
predicates which each define a type of event.
A method according to Claim 8, characterised in
that by means of the comparator unit (7), with the

predicates which are listed in the identification part
(31, 32; P1') of a condition and which define a type of

event, the events (E1, E2) corresponding to the event
type are filtered out of the log (6'), that of these

events the most recent (E2) is isolated, and that the
isolated event (E2) is checked with the predicates

listed in the qualification part (31a, 34, P3') of the
condition (33, 34; B3) to determine whether it

corresponds to the event type thus defined and in the
event of correspondence the condition is marked with

"correct" (true) and in the event of non-correspondence
