<ABSTRACT>
A damper for oscillating machines consisting of a cylindrical 
external casing (1) on the internal wall of which suitable 

circumferential gaskets (7,8) are fixed, which are appropriately 
spaced each other and of a cylindrical piston (9) suitably sliding 

inside said external cylindrical casing, the latter having on 
its walls longitudinal slits (3,4), is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
A damper is a device capable of reducing the vibrations
deriving from the oscillation phenomena of mechanisms. The
damping effect shall be assured not only during normal
operating conditions of the mechanism, when the oscillations
have a periodical trend, but also in particular transient
states when the mechanism is subjected to external forces such
as shocks or sharp accelerations, either positive or negative
that can produce vibrations of greater intensity.Dampers shall also maintain unaltered their vibration reducing
effect for a sufficient period to ensure an acceptable time of
operation and in particular they shall be designed so that
damping efficiency is not appreciably reduced after a number of
work cycles that are comparable to the life of the machine to
which they are applied.The damping effect of a damper can be ensured by a squeezing of
oil from one chamber into another, or by an outlet of air that
is compressed by the vibration, or by friction between two
parts of the device that slide over each another.This last type is used particularly in washing machines for
both household and industrial use and has to ensure a damping
effect with a very low machine noise level. The known type of vibration dampers consist essentially of a
cylindrical easing inside which a cylindrical piston, in some
cases provided with longitudinal fins, can move forwards and
backwards with a certain friction being the two opposite ends
of the cylinder and the piston connected to the casing of the
machine and to the Laundry drum, respectively.Friction between the two mobile parts (the cylinder and the
piston) is assured by the above-mentioned longitudinal fins and
by one or more zones provided with gaskets. In known dampers it
is the piston, which is made of a hard plastic material, that
bears the gaskets and moves inside the metallic cylinder. This
cylinder must be of a controlled roughness and therefore must
be made of drawn tube.The document EP-A-0 336 176 discloses a damper for
oscillating machines having substantially the features of the preamble
of the main claim.The object of the present invention is a vibration damper for
oscillating machines and in particular for household and
industrial washing machines. It consists of an external casing,
essentially cylindrical in shape and of a cylindrical piston
housed inside the cylindrical casing and coaxial with it, being
the internal diameter of this cylindrical casing slightly
greater than the external diameter of the cylindrical piston so
that there is no contact
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A damper for oscillating machines,
provided with suitable fastening devices, consisting

of an external casing (1) of a basically cylinder
form and of a cylindrical piston (9) housed inside

the above-mentioned external cylinder and coaxial
with the latter, directly opposed longitudinal slits

(3,4; 3',4') being formed through said casing (1),
characterized by the fact that the internal diameter

of the cylindrical external casing (1) is slightly
larger that the external diameter of the cylindrical

piston so that there is no contact between the
internal surface of said casing (1) and the external

surface of said piston (9) and that said external
cylindrical casing is provided internally, fixed in

appropriate housings, with two circumferential
gaskets (7,8) spaced from each other so as to abut

against said piston (9) to reduce possible
oscillations thereof and prevent said piston (9) from

rubbing against said internal surface of said casing
(1).
A damper for oscillating machines
according to Claim 1, characterized in that there are

four slits (3,4; 3',4').
A damper for oscillating machines
according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that

the external cylindrical casing (1) is made of hard
plastic material suitable for pressing and that the

internal cylindrical piston (9) consists of a
metallic tube with longitudinal welding.
