<ABSTRACT>
The over-spring arms (41) in the side walls (14) of the engagement sleeve (12) are formed without free cuts and only with separating cuts (43, 46, 47) in the side walls so that they remain attached to the engagement sleeve (12) in the longitudinal edge region at the transition to the base wall (13). The over-spring arms (41) extend from this attachment transversely to the longitudinal direction of the engagement sleeve (12) towards its width (Z) and are bent inwards. This gives a closed, stable box with springforce support which is especially suitable as an over-spring for contact arrangements with high contact force (tin design).

<CLAIMS>
Contact spring (1) having a connection part (2) 
for an electrical conductor and a contact part (3) with 

a spring leg base (4) and spring legs (7,8) proceeding 
from the latter for making contact with a plug contact, 

and having a detent sleeve (12), which is held on the 
spring leg base (4), is produced from a sheet-metal 

stamped and bent part, encloses the contact part (3) in 
the form of a box, is constructed as an overspring and 

has a bottom wall (13), two side walls (14), which each 
have an overspring arm (41) which is cut out from the 

side wall, is bent inwards and rests on a spring leg (7) 
and (8), respectively, a top wall (15), which is divided 

by a production-dictated longitudinal slot (16), and a 
detent spring arm (19), which is cut out from a wall 

(15), extends in the longitudinal direction of the detent 
sleeve (12) and is bent outwards, characterized in that 

the overspring arms (41) are formed only by separating 
cuts (43,46,47) extending essentially transversely with 

respect to the longitudinal direction of the detent 
slee
ve (12), in that these separating cuts run from the 
side walls (14) towards the longitudinal edge region at 

the transition to the bottom wall (13) and end there in 
such a way that the respective overspring arm (41) 

remains connected to the detent sleeve (12) in this 
longitudinal edge region, and in that the respective 

overspring arm (41), which extends from this point of 
connection transversely with respect to the longitudinal 

direction of the detent sleeve (12), is bent inwards 
about a bending line (48) located in this longitudinal  

 
edge region and extending parallel to the longitudinal 

direction and in the direction of the longitudinal 
direction of the detent sleeve (12). 
Contact spring according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, to form an overspring arm (41), provision 

is made of a longer separating cut (43), which is 
directed perpendicularly with respect to the longitudinal 

direction of the detent sleeve (12) and extends to a 
point near to the longitudinal edge (20,32) at the 

transition of the respective side wall (14) to the top 
wall (15), furthermore of a relatively short separating 

cut (46), which is further away from the plug-side end of 
the detent sleeve (12) than the longer separating cut 

(43), is likewise directed perpendicularly with respect 
to the longitudinal direction of the detent sleeve (12) 

and parallel to the longer separating cut (43) and 
extends only slightly into the respective side wall (14), 

as well as of a third separating cut (47), which connects 
these two separating cuts (43,46) to one another at their 

ends, is arranged exclusively in the respective side wall 
(14) of the detent sleeve (12) and extends obliquely with 

respect to the longitudinal direction of the detent 
sleeve (12). 
Contact spring according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the long and the short separating cuts (43, 

46) for forming the overspring arms (41) extend slightly 
around the longitudinal edge (44,45) and end in the 

bottom wall (13). 
Contact spring according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that each overspring arm (41) has a plan shape 

similar to a right-angled triangle. 
Contact spring according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the transition of the longer separating 

cut (43) to the oblique separating cut (47) is formed by 
a radius (49). 
Contact spring according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each overspring arm (41) 

has a perforation (50).  
 
Contact spring according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the perforation (50) is arranged in the 

region of the longitudinal edges (44, 45). 
Contact spring according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the perforation (50) extends both slightly 

into the respective side wall (14) and slightly into the 
bottom wall (13). 
Contact spring according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the perforation (50) is provided 

approximately in the centre of the base width (H) of an 
overspring arm (41). 
Contact spring according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the perforation is arranged exclusively in 

the side wall (14). 
Contact spring according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a spring leg (8) of the 

contact spring (1) is constructed on a longitudinal edge, 
facing the bottom wall (13) of the detent sleeve (12), 

with a tab (10) as a spring preopening contour, which tab 
is torn out in the direction of the other spring leg (7). 
Contact spring according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the longitudinal slot (16) 

of the top wall (15) of the detent sleeve (12) extends 
eccentrically relative to the width of the said top wall, 

with the result that the top wall (15) is separated into 
a narrow partial region (17) and a wide partial region 

(18), and in that the detent spring arm (19) is provided 
in the wide partial region (18).
