<ABSTRACT>
Absolute engine position sensing is provided 
by monitoring the temporal relationship of 

energization of multiple spark plugs (46,48) sharing a 
common source (40) of drive energy in a direct 

ignition application. The spark plugs (46,48) are 
connected across the source (40) with opposing 

electrical polarity, and the relative time of 
discharge across the plugs (46,48) i
s compared by 
sensing the time and polarity of high speed transient 

activity in proximity to the source (40), and thereby 
the position of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
determining engine position and to engine position 
detecting apparatus. The application of camshaft position sensors 
in internal combustion engine control is known 
generally in the art of engine control. For instance, 
such sensors may provide absolute engine position 
information which may be used to synchronise relative 
position inputs to a controller, such as from a 
crankshaft position sensor. The camshaft position 
sensor is typically a dedicated sensor, such as a 
conventional variable reluctance sensor disposed in 
proximity to the camshaft to sense passage of an 
appendage placed on the camshaft, and to communicate 
the passage to a controller for use in synchronising a 
relative engine position input. Significant expense 
is associated with this approach to sensing camshaft 
position including the cost of the variable reluctance 
sensor and the associated packaging and wiring, and 
the additional machining on the camshaft. In a direct ignition system (DIS) for spark 
plug ignition in an internal combustion engine, pairs 
of spark plugs are coupled to a single supply. The 
supply may be a conventional step-up transformer, the 
timing of the charge and discharge of which are 
controlled by a spark controller. The pair of spark 
plugs may be coupled in series across the secondary 
winding of the transformer in reverse electrical 
polarity, wherein the anodes of the pair are grounded. 
The transformer provides energising voltage to the 
pair of spark plugs whenever either of the two must be 
fired for desired engine control. DIS provides a cost 
advantage over electronic ignition systems having one 
dedicated coil per spark plug.  
 WO-A-90 08894 discloses a method of detecting 
time displaced ignition events to determine which 
cylinder of an engine was in combustion stroke. The present invention seeks to provide 
improved engine position detection. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of determining 
when an internal combustion engine is within a 
predetermined operating angle as specified in claim 1. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided engine position detecting 
apparatus as specified in claim 2. The present invention can provide absolute 
engine angular position information without a camshaft 
position sensor in a direct ignition application, by 
monitoring ignition signals in an ignition system for 
an internal combustion engine. The preferred embodiment monitors high

A method of determining when an internal 
combustion engine including first and second spark means 

(46, 48) is at a predetermined operating angle within an 
engine cycle, comprising the steps of applying an 

increasing ignition voltage of a positive electrical 
polarity (64) across spaced electrodes of the first spark means 

(46) and of a negative electrical polarity (62) across the 
spaced electrodes of the second spark means 48; sensing 

the voltages across the spaced electrodes of the first and 
second spark means (46, 48) and combining the sensed 

voltages into a single composite signal (66); detecting a first 
spark event when a sensed voltage of the composite signal 

has a rate of change equal to or greater than a predetermined positive 
rate of change; detecting a second spark event when a 

sensed voltage of the composite signal has a rate of 
change equal to or greater than a predetermined negative rate of 

change; and determining that the engine is at the 
predetermined operating angle within the engine cycle when 

the detected first spark event occurs at least a 
predetermined amount of time after the detected second 

spark event.
