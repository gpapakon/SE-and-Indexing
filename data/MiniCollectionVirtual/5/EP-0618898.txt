<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amidino derivatives,
to methods for their manufacture, to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them and to their use in therapy,
in particular their use as nitric oxide synthase
inhibitors.It has been known since the early 1980's that the
vascular relaxation brought about by acetylcholine is
dependent on the presence of the endothelium and this
activity was ascribed to a labile humoral factor termed
endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The activity
of nitric oxide (NO) as a vasodilator has been known for
well over 100 years and NO is the active component of
amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrite and other
nitrovasodilators. The recent identification of EDRF as NO
has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway
by which NO is synthesised from the amino acid L-arginine
by the enzyme NO synthase.NO is the endogenous stimulator of the soluble
guanylate cyclase and is involved in a number of biological
actions in addition to endothelium-dependent relaxation
including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-cell
communication in the central nervous system (see Moncada et
al, Biochemical Pharmacology,38, 1709-1715 (1989) and
Moncada et al, Pharmacological Reviews,43, 109-142
(1991)). It is now thought that excess NO production may
be involved in a number of conditions, particularly
conditions which involve systemic hypotension such as toxic
shock and therapy with certain cytokines.The synthesis of NO from L-arginine can be inhibited
by the L-arginine analogue L-N-monomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA)
and the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of
toxic shock and other types of systemic hypotension has
been proposed (WO 91/04024 and GB-A-2240041). GB-A-2240041 teaches use of L-iminoethylornithine for the treatment of shock states. The
therapeutic use of certain other NO synthase inhibitors 
apart from L-NMMA for the same purpose has also been
proposed in WO 91/04024 and in EP-A-0446699.It has recently become apparent that there are at
least two types of NO synthase as follows:
(i) a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme that
releases NO for response to receptor or physical
stimulation.(ii) a Ca++ independent enzyme which is induced after
activation of vascular smooth muscle, macrophages,
endothelial cells, and a number of other cells by endotoxin
and cytokines. Once expressed this inducible NO synthase
synthesises NO for long periods.The NO released by the constitutive enzyme acts as a
transduction mechanism underlying several physiological
responses.
