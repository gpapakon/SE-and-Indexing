<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID PRESSURE CYLINDERThe present invention concerns a fluid pressure cylinder comprising a cylinder tube and, attached to each side thereof, an end plate.Fluid pressure cylinders of this kind are previously known. In this connection cylinders could be mentioned where the cylinder end plates are fixed to the cylinder tube by means screwing into the material of the tube or by means of tension rods between the end plates, said tension rods being arranged outside the cylinder tube or in specially arranged channels in the wall material of the cylinder tube.WO 88/1357 describes an example of a fastening arrangement for a cylinder. In this device the fastening between the end plate element and the cylinder tube is achieved by means of a flexible locking element being inserted from the outside into a partly conical space which is formed between the cylinder tube and the attached end plate element.Another solution to the problem of fastening an end plate element is to thread it to the cylinder tube.All of the above mentioned devices comprise well-functioning solutions to the problem of connecting end plates and cylin¬ der tubes in several applications, they however suffer from drawbacks that may be considerable in particular connections. Such drawbacks are: complicated and costly production of the end plate elements, time consuming and thus costly assembling of the piston cylinder aggregates, considerable weight as well as the existance of uneven surfaces as pockets, inward edges, ouward rods and so on on the outside of the cylinder aggregate, said irregularities bringing about considerable problems concerning the possibilities of keeping the aggre¬ gate clean from externally leaking oil and other impurities. 

It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a fluid pressure cylinder of the kind mentioned above, which solves these problems and thus is comprised of simply and cheaply producable elements, said elements allowing fast and precise assembling to a fluid pressure cylinder aggregate, comprises low weight as well as is free from impurity collec¬ ting pockets, protrusions and other irregularities.This aim is achieved according to the invention by the fluid pressure cylinder of the above mentioned kind being characterized by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.Beside the above mentioned aim a possibility is hereby also achieved of producing the parts in a very cost-worthy manner, as synthetic material is used in the end plates.By the features of claims 2 and 3, particular

CLAIMS
1. Fluid pressure cylinder comprising a cylinder tube (4, 31) and an end plate (2, 3, 30) fastened at each end thereof, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in
- the end plates (2, 3, 30) being produced from a synthetic material;
- that each end plate (2, 3, 30) is mounted within the cylin¬ der tube (4, 31) with its outer surface in the same plane as the end plane of the cylinder tube; and
- that means (8, 9, 10; 24, 25, 26) are provided for perma¬ nent snap-in connection between the end plate (2, 3, 30) and cavities (9; 26) in the inner surface of the cylinder tube (4; 31).
2. Cylinder according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in that said means include resilient hook elements (8) being integral with the end plate (2, 3), said elements further being evenly distributed around the circumference of the end plate, and the engaging positions of which essen¬ tially being their rest positions.
3. Cylinder according to claim 2, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in said hook elements (8) co-operating with said cavities (9) in the cylinder tube.
4. Cylinder according to claim 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in that said cavity is comprised of an undercut (10) groove (9) and that the hook elements (8) are provided with corresponding undercuts (10) on its engaging side in a direction towards the outside of the end plate.
5. Cylinder according to any of the claims 2-4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that an annular free space (11) is provided inside the hook elements (8) , said free space being dimensioned to allow the radial inward resilient 


yielding movement of the hook elements (8) when mounting the end plate, as well as possibly receiving a return spring, which co-operates with the piston (5) and which is arranged axially with respect thereto.
6. Cylinder according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in that said means includes a snap-in ring (24) , said ring in the mounted position engaging into an essentially annular groove (25) in the circumferencial surface of the end plate as well as in an essentially annular groove (26) in the inner surface of the cylinder tube.
7. Cylinder according to claim 6, c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d in that said snap-in ring (24) is provided with spring tongues (29) , being distributed around the circumfe¬ rence, for the coaxial allignment of the snap-in ring with the cylinder tube (31) .
8. Cylinder according to any of the previous claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the piston rod side end plate (3) of the cylinder (1) axially most outward is being provided with an integral wiper lip (20) for the co-operation with the piston rod (6) .
9. Cylinder according to any of the previous claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the piston rod side end plate (3) of the cylinder (1) is provided with an integral guiding surface (18) , co-operating with the piston rod, as well as axial cavitites (19) comprising spaces for lubricant on an axial portion thereof.
