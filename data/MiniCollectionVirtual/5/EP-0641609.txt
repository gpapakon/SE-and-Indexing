<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a wind sifter with a stationary housing (1) forming a spiral, as seen in the axial direction, with a guide-blade ring (11) arranged fixedly in the housing (1) and having adjustable blades (12) and with a bladed sifting wheel (14) arranged coaxially to the blade ring (11) within the guide-blade ring and rotating about the housing axis. The raw-material inlet (3) opens tangentially into the annular space (9) between the sifting wheel (14) and guide-blade ring (11), and the sifting-gas inlet (5) directed parallel to the raw-material inlet opens into the annular space (17) between the guide-blade ring (11) and spiral housing (1). Finally, a coarse-material discharge is provided in the end region of the flow in the annular space (9) between the guide-blade ring (11) and sifting wheel (14). The coarse-material outlet is arranged offset in the axial direction of the spiral housing relative to the sifting-gas inlet (5) and to the raw-material inlet (3), with the result that the spiral housing has the three-dimensional shape of a worm with at least one complete worm turn.

<CLAIMS>
An air separator comprising a stationary casing
forming a spiral in the axial direction, a ring of guide

vanes disposed so as to be stationary in the casing and
with adjustable vanes, a vaned separating wheel rotating

round the casing axis and disposed coaxially inside the
ring of guide vanes, an inlet for crude gas opening

tangentially into the annular space between the
separating wheel and the ring of guide vanes, an inlet

for separating gas parallel to the previously-mentioned
inlet and opening into the annular space between the ring

of guide vanes and the spiral casing, and finally an
outlet for coarse material in the end region of the flow

in the annular space between the ring of guide vanes and
the separating wheel, characterised in that the outlet

(8) for coarse material is offset in the axial direction
of the spiral casing relative to the inlet (5) for

separating gas and the inlet (3) for material to be
separated and consequently the spiral casing has the

shape of a helix which has at least one complete turn.
An air separator according to claim 1, characterised
in that the separating wheel (7) is so disposed relative

to the likewise helical stationary ring of guide vanes
that the vanes on the separating wheel substantially

completely cover the vanes of the ring of guide vanes
both in the inlet region and also in the outlet region of

the separator casing.
