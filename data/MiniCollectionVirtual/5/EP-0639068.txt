 ACNE TREATING COMPOSITION\ TECHNICAL FIELD' 5 The present invention relates to methods for treating acne and related pilosebaceous disorders with a safe and effective amount of salicylic acid and pantothenic acid or a pantothenic acid derivative. This combination is found to be less irritating and drying to the skin than salicylic acid alone. In further 10 embodiments, the present invention also relates to methods for regulating wrinkles and/or atrophy in mammalian skin by treatment with this combination.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAcne is a common inflammatory pilosebaceous disease15 characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, inflamed nodules, superficial pus-filled cysts, and in extreme cases, sinus formation and deep inflammation, sometimes associated with purulent sacs.The pathoÏ‚enesis of acne is complex. An interaction between20 hormones, keratinization, sebum, and bacteria somehow determines the course and severity of the disease. Acne begins at puberty when the increase of androgens causes an increase in the size and activity of the pilosebaceous glands. The earliest microscopic change is intrafollicular hyperkeratosis, which leads to25 restriction of the pilosebaceous follicle with consequent formation of the comedone composed of sebum, keratin, and microorganisms, particularly Propionibacterium (Corvnebacterium) acnes. Lipases from P. acnes break down triglycerides in the sebum to form free fatty acids (FFA), which irritate the30 follicular wall. Retention of sebaceous secretions and dilation of the follicle may lead to cyst formation. Rupture of theH follicle with release of the contents into the tissues induces an inflammatory reaction which heals with scarring in severe cases.Acne tends to appear during puberty and to fade away again,35 usually spontaneously when growth has stopped. Only rarely does it recede before the age of 20 and occasionally it is still to be found at the age of 30 and beyond. The face, back, and shoulders 

 are the predominant areas affected. Particularly with the face, severe cases can cause alterations resulting in considerable disfigurement with significant psychological burdens for the afflicted person. Acne can be treated by topical application of various lotions, salves, and the like or by, for example, localized treatment with sulphur, resorcinol, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, vitamin A acids, antibiotics such as erythro ycin, and the like. Salicylic acid is a well recognized anti-acne active ingredient which causes a reduction in intercellular cohesion
