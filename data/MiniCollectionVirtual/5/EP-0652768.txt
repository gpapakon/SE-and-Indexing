<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical preparation or system for activation of natural killer cells (NK cells), for example in order to treat tumors or virus infections, and which comprises a first composition containing interferon- alpha  or analogues thereof, together with a second composition containing at least one substance with H2, or 5-HT1A, receptor agonist activity, for example, histamine or serotonin. The first and second compositions are either mixed in a preparation or furnished in separate doses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a pharmaceutical preparation
for activation of natural killer cells (NK-cells)
and a process for is production.Natural killer cells (NK-cells) are a group of spontaneously
cytotoxic lymphocytes that destroy tumor cells by lysis with no
antigen specificity or restriction by histocompatibility molecules.
Monocytes are involved in the regulation of the NK-cell's
function, both through mechanisms involving cell contact and
through providing soluble NK cell-regulating mediators. Recently,
a cell contact-mediated mechanism has been described whereby
monocytes regulate NK-cells. This type of monocyte-mediated
regulation is exerted by monocytes that are obtained directly
from peripheral blood through counterflow centrifugal elutriation
(CCE) and is regulated by the biogenic amines histamine and serotonin
(Hellstrand and Hermodsson, 1986, J. Immunol. 137, 656-660;
Hellstrand and Hermodsson, 1987, J. Immunol. 139, 869-875;
Hellstrand and Hermodsson, 1990, Scant. J. Immunol. 31, 631-645;
Hellstrand and Hermodsson, 1990, Cell. Immunol. 127, 199-214;
Hellstrand, Kjellson and Hermodsson, 1991, Cell. Immunol., 138,
44-54). These NK-cell regulating mechanisms caused by biogenic
amines should be of importance to the NK cell-mediated defence
against metastatic tumors in vivo (Hellstrand, Asea and Hermodsson
(1990), J. Immunology 145, 4365-4370).Interferon-α (IFN-α) is an important regulating factor for NK
cells. It effectively enhances the NK cell's cytotoxicity (NKCC)
both in vivo and in vitro (Trinchieri, 1989, Adv. immunol. 47, 
187-376; Einhorn, Blomgren and Strander, 1978, Int. J. Cancer 22,
405-412; Friedman and Vogel, 1984, Adv. Immunol., 34, 97-140).
The biogenic amine histamine and human IFN-α enhance in an
additive mode the activity of NK cells (Hellstrand and
Hermodsson, 1936, J. Immunol. 137, 656-660).Owing to the high rate of cancer and the only partially successful
treatment methods avaliable today, there is a constant demand
for other improved methods of treatment of tumors. There is also
a great demand for improved treatment methods for virus infections.The goal of the invention is to create a pharmaceutical preparation
for the effective synergistic stimulation of NK cells in the
presence of monocytes, e.g., in
order to treat tumors, primarily myelomas, renal cancer, leukemias
and melanoma, or to treat virus infections, primarily
chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The preparation
according to the invention involves a first composition, containing
interferon-α, and a second
