and either an antitumor or a carcinostatic effect, and that they also have the effect of promoting the growth of hematopoietic stem 
cells wherein Y represents 0 or 1; R¹ represents unsusbstituted C₁-C₈ alkyl, etc.; R² represents hydrogen, C₁-C₅ alkyl, etc.; R³

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel amino acid derivatives
which have immunomodulating activity, antitumor activity
and/or hematopoietic stem cell-amplifying activity and are
represented by the general formulae (I-1) to (I-5) shown hereinafter,
and also it relates to salts of salt-formable ones of said
amino acid derivatives. Further, this invention relates to
an immunomodulator comprising as active ingredient a novel
amino acid derivative represented by the general formulae (I-1) to (I-5)
or a salt thereof, and an antitumor agent comprising as
active ingredient a novel amino acid derivative represented
by the general formulae (I-1) to (I-5) or a salt thereof, as well as a
hematopoietic stem cell amplifier comprising as active ingredient
a novel amino acid derivative represented by the
general formulae (I-1) to (I-5) or a salt thereof.Because many of antitumor agents which have
heretofore been clinically used are inherently cytotoxic
substances, they are accompanied by the drawbacks that they
generally have strong toxicity, can give damages to normal
cells along with their ability to prevent growth of cancer 
cells, and hence can induce strong side-effects. There is
accordingly an outstanding demand for novel antitumor
agents which have such a mechanism of the activity as
different from that of the conventional antitumor agents,
show low toxicity and weaker side-effects and are effective
for therapeutic treatment of human tumors.As a result of an extensive investigation, we, the
present inventors, have succeeded in synthesizing novel amino
acid derivatives which can be represented by the general
formulae (I-1) to (I-5) shown hereinafter, and we have also found that
these amino acid derivatives stimulate activation of T cell of
mammals and hence have one or more of the immunomodulating
activity and the antitumor and/or carcinostatic activities
against various tumors and/or cancers, as well as the hematopoietic
stem cell-amplifying activity. Based on these
findings, the present invention has been completed.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
therefore, there is provided a novel amino acid derivative of
the hereinafter described formulae (I-1) to (I-5) or a salt thereof, as a
novel substance. This novel amino acid derivative according
to the present invention is a compound which is represented
by the following general formulae (I-1) to (I-5), namely an amino acid
derivative having the general formulae (I-1) to (I-5):
