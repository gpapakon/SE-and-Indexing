<ABSTRACT>
A card comprises a cylinder (10) and parts adjustable relative to and preferably at a nominal distance from the latter, such as a licker-in (50), a stationary flat (14), a revolving flat and a doffer. For checking the existing or already set distance between the cylinder (10) and the parts located opposite the latter, a sensor (344,532) is provided. The sensor can be arranged on the side of the arrangement or in a region which is located between the sides of the cylinder. The sensor can be carried by a bar over the flat.
