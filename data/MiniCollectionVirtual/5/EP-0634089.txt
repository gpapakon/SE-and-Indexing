<ABSTRACT>
The mower comprises two cutter bars (1,2) lying in 
end to end relationship with rotating cutter means with 

knives (4) rotating in one plane. The cutter bars (1,2) 
are suspended in relation to a common frame with a vertical 

degree of freedom, in which the two ends of each 
cutter bar (1,2) to a certain degre are independently 

movable. The two adjacent ends of the two cutter (1,2) 
bars are connected by means of a hinge comprising a ball 

joint (9), the ball joint (9) being substantially positioned 
in the rotating plane of the knives (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mower comprising two
cutter bars lying in end to end relationship with rotating
cutter means, such as cutter discs, with knives rotating
in one plane, said cutter bars being suspended in
relation to a common frame with a vertical degree of
freedom, the two ends of each cutter bar being to a
certain degree independently movable, and the adjacent
ends of the two cutter bars being connected by means of a
hinge.A mower of this type is known from DK-B-162.320 and the
corresponding DE-A-30 17 856
which discloses a mower with a cutter bar mounted in a
frame, said cutter bar being divided in the middle in two
half parts which are mutually connected by means of a
hinge placed under the rotating plane of the knives. Here
it is a question of a strong hinge which ensures that the
two cutter bar halves cannot turn in relation to each
other transversely to the hinge axis.The division of the cutter bar in at least two
halves as disclosed in the Danish published specification
is among other things made to make the cutter bar adjustable
to the surface of a field by bending in the hinge.
This adjustment to the field surface is particularly important
for mowers having a big width. Such a mower with
a big width is known from Applicant's DK-A-251/93, which
describes a mower with two working aggregates each comprising
a frame part, in which a cutter bar is suspended.
The frame part is by means of substantially horizontal
parallellogram arms suspended in a carrier frame, the
frame part being movable substantially vertically relative
to the carrier frame. The frame parts of the two
working aggregates are connected, and it is therefore not
possible for the two cutter bars to turn relative to each
other in order to adjust themselves to a not plane field
surface. In order to introduce such a possibility for 
adjustment it is desirable to omit the connection between
the frame parts of the working aggregates and instead
hinge the two cutter bars relative to each other as described
by way of introduction to ensure that they and in
particular their knife means cannot collide.Use of the hinge described in DK-B-162.320 in connection
with a modification of the mower according to DK-A-251/93
would, however, entail several drawbacks: thus,
it is generally a drawback that the hinge is placed below
the rotational plane of the knives, because this entails
that the distance between the outermost adjacent cutter
means on the to cutter bars has to be bigger than the
distance between two adjacent cutter means on a
