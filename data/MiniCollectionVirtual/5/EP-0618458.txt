<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure invention is directed to a nuclear magnetic 
resonance measurement apparatus that can be utilized in a logging 

device which operates generally centrally in a borehole, and has 
a generally circumferential region of investigation, but which 

permits usage of relatively powerful permanent magnets, such as 
rare-earth magnets, that are not permeable to the RF magnetic 

field. This is achieved by employing side-by-side spaced apart 
elongated magnets, and an RF current loop in the region between 

the magnets. In a disclosed embodiment, the magnets are each in 
the shape of a segment of a cylinder, and the respective axes of 

elongation of the magnets are parallel. The magnets have 

respective casings with electrically conductive surfaces, and the 
RF current loop includes at least a portion of the conductive 

surfaces of the magnet casings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to determination of nuclear magnetic resonance properties of
substances, and has particular application to determination of nuclear magnetic
resonance properties of earth formations surrounding a borehole.There have been various prior approaches suggested and/or implemented for
measuring nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") properties of earth formations
surrounding a borehole to obtain evidence of the substances present.It is well recognized that any particles of a formation having non-zero magnetic spin,
for example protons, have a tendency to align with a magnetic field imposed on the
formation. Such a magnetic field may be naturally generated, as is the case for the
earth's magnetic field, BE. When a second magnetic field B1, transverse to BE, is
imposed on the protons by a logging tool electromagnet, the protons will align with
the vector sum of BE and B1 after a sufficient polarization time has passed. If the
polarizing field B1 is then switched off, the protons will tend to precess about the BE
vector with a characteristic Larmor frequency Ï‰L which depends on the strength of the
earth's field BE and the gyromagnetic constant of the particle. Hydrogen nuclei
precessing about a magnetic field BE of 0.5 x 10-4T (0.5 gauss) have a characteristic
frequency of approximately 2 kHz. If a population of hydrogen nuclei were made to
precess in phase, the combined magnetic fields of the protons can generate a
detectable oscillating voltage in a receiver coil. Hydrogen nuclei (protons) of water
and hydrocarbons occurring in rock pores produce NMR signals distinct from signals
induced in other rock constituents.A further NMR approach employs a locally generated static magnetic field, B0, which
may be produced by one or more permanent magnets. Nuclear spins align with the
applied field B0 with a time constant of T1. The angle between the nuclear
magnetization and the applied field can be changed by applying an RF magnetic field 
B1 perpendicular to the static field B0. The frequency of the RF field must be (4.258
kHz/10-4T).B0 ((4.258 kHz/Gauss).B0). The angle of nutation (tilt) obtained between
the nuclear magnetization and the static field is proportional to the product of B1 and
the duration of the RF pulse. At the end of the RF pulse, the nuclear spins precess
around the static field B0 at the Larmor frequency (4.258 kHz/10-4T).B0 ((4.258
kHz/Gauss).B0). The rotating component of the nuclear magnetization decays with a
time constant T2 which is less than T1. Various measurements, known
