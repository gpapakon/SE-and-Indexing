<ABSTRACT>
A control apparatus for a hydraulically operated 
vehicular transmission (1) has a plurality of transmission 

trains (G1 - G5) to be established by a selective 
operation of a plurality of hydraulic engaging elements 

(C1 - C5). The apparatus has a selecting device for 
selecting a transmission train according to a running 

condition of a vehicle. The apparatus is provided with a 
detecting device for detecting a power transmission 

capability value of the hydraulic engaging elements, and a 
device for determining a transmission train to be 

established, based on a detected result of the detecting 

device and a selected result of the selecting device. The 
detecting device detects a hydraulic engaging element 

whose power transmission capability value is above a 
predetermined value and designates a transmission train 

that corresponds to the detected hydraulic engaging 
element. The device for determining the transmission 

train determines a transmission train to be established, 
based on the transmission train designated by the 

detecting device and the transmission train or trains 
selected by the selecting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control apparatus 
for a hydraulically operated vehicular transmission having 
a plurality of transmission trains to be established by a 
selective operation of a plurality of hydraulic engaging 
elements. As a control apparatus for this kind of 
transmission, there is conventionally known the following. 
Namely, a control apparatus is provided with a hydraulic 
control circuit for controlling the supply and discharge 
of hydraulic oil to and from a plurality of hydraulic 
engaging elements, and an electronic control circuit in 
which there are stored mapped speed change characteristics 
to be defined by parameters of an engine load such as a 
throttle opening degree, and a vehicle speed. By means of 
the electronic control circuit a transmission train 
corresponding to the throttle opening degree and the 
vehicle speed at the present moment is selected, and an 
order signal is outputted to the hydraulic control 
circuit. The hydraulic oil is then supplied to the 
hydraulic engaging element that was selected so as to  
 
establish the selected transmission train, thereby 
effecting an automatic speed changing. The speed change characteristics define an upshift 
characteristic line (upshift line) and a downshift 
characteristic line (downshift line) between respective 
two transmission trains that are next to each other in the 
order of speed. In the hysteresis region between the 
upshift line and the downshift line it becomes possible to 
establish both transmission trains on the low-speed side 
and the high-speed side. Especially, there is recently a 
tendency of enlarging the region in which the high-speed 
transmission trains can be established in order to improve 
the specific fuel consumption. In this case, if the speed 
change characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 are employed, 
there will be a region in which three or more transmission 
trains can be established. It becomes therefore difficult 
to judge which transmission train should be established. In order to solve this problem, there is known, as 
in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 
190960/1988, an art in which the following procedure is 
followed. Namely, the speed change characteristics and 
the throttle opening degree as well as the vehicle speed 
at the present moment are compared, and the lowest speed 
transmission train SL that can be established and the 
highest speed transmission train SH that can be 
established from the viewpoint of speed change  
 
characteristics are picked up.
