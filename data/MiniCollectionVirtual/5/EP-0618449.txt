<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improvement to the method of 
determining the concentration of a hemoglobin adduct in 

a blood sample by the steps of assaying the blood 
sample for the total amount of hemoglobin, assaying the 

blood sample for the hemoglobin adduct, and dividing 
the hemoglobin adduct concentration by the total 

hemoglobin concentration. The improvement involves 
normalizing the measurement of the hemoglobin adduct to 

the total amount of hemoglobin in the blood sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The level of glycation of certain circulating
proteins, e.g. hemoglobin, can be used to monitor the
average blood glucose because glycation is a nonenzymatic,
slow and continuous reaction that is primarily
dependent on the ambient glucose concentration to
which the hemoglobin is exposed during its residence
time in the circulatory system. These two factors,
glucose concentration and residence time, translate in
vivo to the degree and duration of increased blood
glucose concentration (hyperglycemia). Thus, when the
blood glucose level is elevated, as it is in diabetic
people whose diabetes is not well controlled, increased
amounts of glycated hemoglobin are formed. The amount
of glycated hemoglobin in an individual's blood reflects
the average blood glucose concentration to which hemoglobin
has been exposed during its life in the circulatory
system. This period is about 100 days, so the
determination of the concentration of glycated hemoglobin 
can provide an historical picture of the individual's
blood glucose profile.Methods described for the measurement of glycated
hemoglobin include chromatography on an ion exchange
column or boronate affinity columns, HPLC and agarose
gel electrophoresis. Each of these techniques has
drawbacks with respect to complexity, costly instrumentation,
accuracy or variability.Immuno techniques are available whereby monoclonal
antibodies have been developed to react with epitopes
of the glycated hemoglobin, i.e. that derivative of
hemoglobin formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of
glucose with reactive amine groups on the hemoglobin
protein, and facilitate the determination of glycated
hemoglobin concentration by standard immunochemistry
techniques such as ELISA or a latex agglutination
assay. Such an agglutination assay is disclosed in
U.S. Patent 4,970,171 wherein there is described an
immunoassay for glycated hemoglobin, e.g. HbA1c, a
variety of hemoglobin with glycation at the Î² subunit
in a blood sample, which involves the steps of:
a) treating the blood sample with a thiocyanate
salt capable of denaturing the hemoglobin contained
therein and an oxidant capable of converting the
hemoglobin in the treated blood sample to the
met-hemoglobin form; b) assaying the treated sample for met-hemoglobin
as representing the amount of total hemoglobin in
the sample;c) assaying the denatured, oxidized blood sample
by immunoassay for the amount of denatured form of
the particular hemoglobin derivative being sought;
andd) calculating the relative amount of hemoglobin
that is in the
