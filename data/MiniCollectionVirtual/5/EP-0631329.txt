junction and a back selectrode layer, which process contains a step of 

forming an amorphous silicon oxide layer (3) between the transparent 
electrode layer (2) and a p-type layer (4) by glow discharge in an 

atmosphere containing carbon dioxide; a step of forming a p-type 
amorphous silicon carbide layer (4) using a reactive gas mixture 

comprising silane, methane, and diborane having incorporated therein a 
proper amount of trimethylboron; a step of forming a first back electrode

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an 
amorphous silicon solar cell which can be used in integrated 
solar cells or photo sensors. A unit solar cell comprising amorphous silicon 
(hereinafter abbreviated as a-Si) basically has the layer 
structure shown in Fig. 1, which is composed of insulating 
substrate 1 having laminated thereon transparent electrode 
layer 2, a-Si layer 3, and metallic back electrode layer 4 in 
this order. A unit solar cell of this type is usually produced as 
follows. Transparent electrode layer 2 comprising a 
transparent conductive film of tin oxide (SnO₂), zinc oxide 
(ZnO), indium-tin oxide, etc. is formed on glass substrate 1 
to a thickness of about 4500 to 20000 Å by thermal CVD or 
sputtering. It is widespread to subject transparent 
electrode layer 2 to a glow discharge treatment in hydrogen 
gas as hereinafter described. On transparent electrode layer 
2 are deposited p-type amorphous silicon carbide (hereinafter 
referred to as a-SiC) layer 31 to a thickness of about 100 Å, 
intrinsic a-Si layer 32 to a thickness of from 0.1 to 0.4 µm, 
and n-type a-Si layer to a thickness of about 300 Å in this 
order by glow discharge decomposition of silane gas to form  
 
a-Si layer 3 having a p-i-n junction. The p-type layer 
contains boron and carbon, and the n-type layer contains 
phosphorus as dopants. Finally, back electrode 4 comprising, 
for example, aluminum, zinc oxide, silver, copper or the 
like, is formed on a-Si layer 3 by sputtering or vacuum 
evaporation. A hydrogen glow discharge treatment before deposition 
of p-type a-SiC is known as a means for improving performance 
properties of a-Si solar cells. The hydrogen glow discharge 
treatment of a transparent electrode layer improves contact 
characteristics with the p-type layer to thereby increase 
conversion efficiency of solar cells. However, if a transparent electrode layer comprising 
SnO₂ is subjected to a hydrogen glow discharge treatment for 
an extended treating time, SnO₂ undergoes reduction to Sn, 
which leads to a reduction in transmission of the SnO₂ layer. 
As a result, the amount of light absorbed by the a-Si layer 
is reduced, giving adverse influences on the performance of 
the solar cell. Where a transparent electrode layer 
comprises ZnO, the hydrogen glow discharge treatment fails to 
improve the contact characteristics between ZnO and the p-type 
layer, hardly improving the performance characteristics. Further, the conventional p-type a-Si layer incurs a 
large absorption loss
