<ABSTRACT>
A process for identifying patterns of electric energy 
or similar supplied resource consumption and demand in a 

facility and determining possible changes in the facility 
for such energy or similar conservation, using, in the case 

of electric energy, monthly electric billing data over the 
years to ascertain billing periods and KW and Kwh consumption 

and to obtain from the ratio Kwh/KW the hours use of 
peak demand per week, which provides a useful estimate of 

hours of use for the facility. Together with minimal facility 
data (just area data) and daily maximum and minimum 

outside temperature data, the process identifies patterns 
of consumption and demand, and then uses conveyance of an 

empirical analysis to disaggregate biling data into lighting, 
power and HVAC end-use categories, and a statistical 

analysis, including regression, to separate the same billing 
data into usage and temperature-dependent components. 

Proposed retrofits for energy conservation are indicated 
and then implementable. Actual savings are calculated and 

used to further refine the model of actual facility operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates broadly to processes for 
analyzing and identifying patterns of electric energy 
consumption and demand in a facility, more particularly 
involving analyzing electric power billing data for the 
facility and isolating usage and temperature-dependent 
consumption and demand, while simultaneously disaggregating 
the bills into component end-users; being specifically 
directed to using the resulting patterns describing 
existing facility power operations to predict and then 
verify the effect of changes which might be made to the 
facility for implementation in the facility with resulting 
energy conservation. Particularly within the past decade or so, substantial 
effort has been made to provide techniques for 
disaggregating or decomposing total building or other 
facility energy consumption usage or load into the actual 
principal end-use in the facility in order to obtain an 
understanding of the energy uses in the facility, from 
which improvements in energy consumption can be suggested,  
 
evaluated and hopefully ultimately implemented. Not only 
is the consumer interested in the economy and energy 
saving, but also there is often no sales tax levied on 
manufacturing use of power as distinguished from other 
uses, making segregation of uses of value; and the 
utilities themselves obtain incentives in public utility 
commission rate setting for energy conservation, as well. Among these techniques are those using utility 
electric bills, building audit data, end-use metering and 
computer simulation as sources of information as to the 
facility's energy performance. One such example is 
described in an article, entitled "An Algorithm to 
Disaggregate Combined Whole-Building Hourly Electric Load 
into End-Uses" by H. Akbari et al, of Laurence Berkeley 
Laboratory, appearing at pages of , 19 , and in 
which an extensive bibliography of prior techniques is 
presented. Limitations in prior approaches to analysis 
through the disaggregation monthly electric utility 
billing data into end-use or time-of-use information are 
pointed out in said article, including the general 
requirement for complete detailed building information, 
insufficient detail on time of use and building operations 
within such monthly data, aggregation of daytime with  
 
nighttime use as well as weekday with weekend use, and 
other limitations. Such has led Akbari et al, in said 
article, and others skilled in this art to conclude that 
only end-use load profile information, as through end-use 
submete

A process for identifying patterns of electric energy 
consumption and demand in a facility having lighting, 

power/process and HVAC energy-consuming devices 
distributed therethrough, determining possible 

changes in the facility and its devices for energy 
conservation implementing such changes in the facility 

and its devices and verifying the actual energy conservation 
produced thereby, that comprises: providing 

monthly electric billing data for the facility over a 
twelve consecutive month period to ascertain therefrom 

billing periods and KW and Kwh consumption and to 
obtain from the ratio thereof (Kwh/KW) the hours of 

peak demand per week, which provides an estimate of 
hours of use for the facility; providing facility area 

[data] and daily minimum and maximum outside weather 

temperature data for the prior twelve months; 
collating said data; identifying from the provided and 

collated data, patterns of energy consumption and 
demand; disaggregating KW demand among end-uses of 

lighting, power/process and HVAC use-dependent, and 
producing estimates of their effective connected load 

at peak demand, while attributing the remaining KW not 
distributed among such end-uses to HVAC temperature-dependent 

 
end-use; disaggregating energy consumption 

according to end-use by using the said estimate of 
hours of use of the facility and attributing remaining 

consumption to HVAC end-use; performing analysis of 
regressing consumption against a polynomial of outside 

temperature data for lighting/power and HVAC use-dependent 
hours of operation; adjusting the hours of 

operation estimates across the monthly data for a 
best-fit curve and opti-mization; predicting energy 

conservation potential by analyzing performance 
characteristics of proposed retrofit changes against 

existing operating conditions, implementing at the 
facility the said proposed retrofit changes in the 

facility and its said devices; and verifying by 
comparison of energy conservation vation actually 

achieved after retrofit with the predicted energy 
conservation potential to enable further changes if 

required. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the said 
performance characteristics are verified and then the 

retrofit changes are implemented according to the 
predictions to achieve corresponding conservation in 

the facility. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the 
 

said estimates of the effective connected load 
at peak demand for lighting, power and process 

are held at constant level during the analysis 
across all billing periods except as modified by 

changes in the total usage of the facility. 
A process as claimed in claim 3 and in which the 
estimates are refined by actual data, with each 

end-use category becoming the sum of defined 
devices in the facility and their hours of 

operation, with unspecified operating hours 
quantified as required to account for all 

consumption within the end-use. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the 
actual results of making a retrofit change in 

energy consuming equipment in the facility are 
quantified by calculating the difference in 

consumption before and after the retrofit. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 and in which the 
value of energy savings is calculated by 

normalizing the before-retrofit billing data to 
current billing data period and weather 

temperature conditions, using said equations 
developed for the total bill in the said 

 
statistical analysis, and subtracting after-retrofit 

billing data to identify the 
differential. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which 
said disaggregating of the utility bills is 

effected while developing an optimal set of 
statistics accurately to describe the monthly 

variations in billing data. 
A process as claimed in claim 7 and in which 
equations for said regressing are both linear to 

describe the hours of use components of the 
bills, and polynomial because the relation of 

consumption to weather is a curve. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which 
normative statistics are provided to permit the 

user to verify that the said disaggregating has 
been properly effected. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the 
regression analysis is used to effect said 

optimization of the assumptions of a load shape 
corresponding to actual patterns of consumption 

and demand at the facility, thereby to develop 
high correlation and minimal monthly residuals. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the 
regressions and analysis of the total bill is performed 

on a polynomial of OAT and lighting hours of 
use as well as process hours of use as well as the 

HVAC use-dependent hours of use to account for the 
usage-dependent portion of each bill, but the 

regressing analysis of the disaggregated HVAC portion 
of the bill, where performed on the same temperature-dependent 

factors, only takes into account HVAC use-dependent 
hours of use which define the hours of use 

for the facility. 
A process as claimed in claim 11 and in which said 
optimization is achieved by adjusting the monthly 

hours of use for lighting, process and HVAC use-dependent 
within predefined margins through automatic use 

of linear programming techniques, driving monthly 
residuals to a minimum for both the total bill and its 

HVAC component with high confidence factor. 
A process as claimed in claim 12 and in which said 
disaggregating and optimization are repeated until a 

 
satisfactory representation of matching actual 

conditions at the facility is attained. 
A process as claimed in claim 13 and in which 
the results of the optimized analyses are fed 

back to data collation for storage and use. 
A process as claimed in claim 14 and in which 
weekday and weekend consumption profiles are 

graphically presented as part of the feed back 
data to provide usual confirmation that the 

facility assumptions are justified. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which two 
day types, two operating rates and a time 

descriptor to indicate which is when are 
employed as a data input. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 and in which the 
actual facility operating hour/demand is monitored 

in real time and compared with the estimate 
thereof. 
A process as claimed in claim 17 and in which the 
monitored and estimated hour/demand data are both 

visually displayed and compared. 
A process for identifying patterns of consumption 
and demand of a supplied resource in a facility having 

resource-consuming devices distributed therethrough, 
and determining possible changes in the facility and 

its devices for resource conservation, that comprises: 
providing monthly resource billing data for the 

facility over a twelve consecutive month period to 
ascertain therefrom billing periods consumption to 

obtain the hours of peak demand per week, which 
provides an estimate of hours of use for the facility; 

providing facility area and daily minimum and maximum 
outside environment data for the prior twelve months; 

collating said data; itentifying from the provided and 
collated data, patterns of resource consumption and 

demand; disaggregating KW demand among end-uses and 
producing estimates of their effective connected load 

at peak demand, while attributing the remainder not 
distributed among such end-uses to environment-dependent 

end-use; disaggregating resource consumption 
according to end-use by using the said estimate of 

 
hours of use of the facility and attributing remaining 

consumption to environment-dependent end-use; performing 
analysis of regressing consumption against a polynomial 

of outside environment data for specified use-dependent 
hours of operation; adjusting the hours of 

operation estimates across the monthly data for a 
best-fit curve and optimization; predicting resource 

conservation potential by analyzing performance 
characteristics of proposed retrofit changes against 

existing operating conditions; implementing at the 
facility the said proposed retrofit changes in the 

facility and its said devices; and verifying by comparison 
of resource conservation actually achieved 

after retrofit with the predicted resource conservation 
potential to enable further changes if required. 
A process as claimed in claim 19 and in which the 
supplied resource was one of electric energy and water 

or other fluid flow.
