<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a treated pillared clay made by the process 
comprising the steps of: 


(A) contacting at least one clay with an effective amount of at least 
one ammonium ion source to exchange sodium and/or calcium ions in said clay for 

ammonium ions to provide an ammonium-containing clay, said clay comprising metal 
oxides and hydroxides and having a lamellar structure with lamellar layers and 

interlamellar spaces disposed between the lamellar layers and exchangeable sodium 
and/or calcium ions occupying said interlamellar spaces; 
(B) contacting said ammonium-containing clay with an effective 
amount of at least one source of fluorine to replace at least part of the hydroxyl 

groups in said clay with fluorine to provide a fluorine- and ammonium-containing 
clay; 
(C) contacting said fluorine- and ammonium-containing clay with 
an effective amount of at least one pillaring agent to form a fluorine-containing 

pillared clay; and 
(D) contacting said fluorine-containing pillared clay with an effective 
amount of at least one inorganic acid to impregnate and/or incorporate at least part 

of said acid on said clay. 
This invention also relates to a process for making the foregoing treated 
pillared clays. This invention also relates to the use of these treated pillared clays as 

alkylation catalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treated pillared clays and their use as
alkylation catalysts.Natural and synthetic clays having lamellar structures with interlamellar
spaces disposed between the lamellar layers are well known. Smectites, such as
bentonite, montmorillonites and the like are a class of clays possessing such a
lamellar structure. Montmorillonite has an idealized stoichiometric composition
corresponding to Na0.67Al3.33Mg0.67(Si8)O20(OH)4. Structurally, it comprises a central
layer containing octrahedrally coordinated aluminum and magnesium in the form of
their oxides and hydroxides sandwiched between two layers containing tetrahedrally
coordinated silicon essentially in the form of its oxide. Normally in nature cations
are present to compensate for the charge imbalance caused by isomorphous
substitution of Mg2+ for Al3+ in the octahedral layer, and/or Al3+ or other ions for
Si4+ in the tetrahedral layers. The octrahedral and tetrahedral regions are tightly
bound together to form a lamellar layer. The space between these lamellar layers,
i.e., the interlamellar space, in natural clays is normally occupied by exchangeable
Ca2+ or Na+ ions. The distance between the interlamellar layers can be substantially
increased by absorption of a variety of polar molecules such as water, ethylene
glycol, amines, etc., which enter the interlamellar space and in doing so push apart
the lamellar layers. The interlamellar spaces tend to collapse when the molecules 
occupying the space are removed, for example by heating the clay at a high
temperature.U.S. Patents 4,216,188 and 4,248,739 disclose stabilized pillared
interlayered clays in which the layers are separated and supported by "pillars" of
oligomeric or polymeric species derived from metal hydroxides. In U.S. Patent
4,248,739 the use of the pillared interlayered clays as sorbents, catalysts and
catalytic supports is described.Alkylation is a reaction in which an alkyl group is added to an organic
molecule. The reaction of an isoparaffin with an olefin to provide an isoparaffin of
higher molecular weight is an example of such a reaction. The reaction of C2 to C5
olefins with isobutane in the presence of an acidic catalyst to produce so-called
"alkylates" has resulted in the manufacture of valuable blending components for
gasoline, due to the fact that these alkylates have high octane ratings.Traditionally, industrial alkylation processes for making isoparaffin-olefin
alkylates include the use of hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid as catalysts under
controlled
