<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to self-standing 
flexible pouches for containing liquids or fine granules, 
particularly liquid detergents. The use of flexible standing pouches for containing 
liquids is well known in the packaging industry. However, 
such pouches are prone to instability problems, such as the 
inability to retain an upright position when filled.  
 In order to try and overcome this problem the art 
describes pouches produced from thick and thus more 
expensive material. Many pouches described in the art 
frequently require a means of support such as a frame in 
order that the pouches stand upright. Indeed, even pouches 
produced from thick material may often also require 
additional support means so that they maintain an upright 
position. Other pouches that are disclosed in the art, commonly 
referred to as Doypacks are designed so that in the 
upright position the pouches stand on the pouches' bottom 
edges, so that the majority of the base wall is not in 
contact with the surface. However, such pouches are prone 
to the weakening of the bottom edges of the pouches over 
time, resulting in the eventual collapse of the bottom 
edges and loss of upright stability and ultimately the 
collapse of the pouch itself. FR-A-2 417 440 discloses a pouch according to the preamble 
of claim 1, comprising peripheral edges of the front wall, 
back wall and base wall in the base portion of said pouch 
sealed and cut in oblique manner. This improves the self-standing 
of said pouch. US-3 380 646 describes a method for making a Doypack, 
according to the preamble of claims 7 and 8.  
 Thus, a principle object of the present invention is 
to provide a flexible pouch for containing liquids which is 
self-standing. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a flexible pouch which is sufficiently stable to 
allow a consumer to firmly grasp and pour out the contents 
of the pouch with confidence.  
 Another object of the present invention is to reduce 
the amount of material from which the pouches are 
manufactured. Additionally the pouch material should 
collapse when discarded and thereby reduce the volume of 
generated waste material. Yet a further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pouch from a material which is lightweight but 
strong and robust. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
pouches which can be manufactured by simple adaptation of 
the existing manufacturing methods used for Doypacks. The present invention is a self-standing flexible 
pouch for

<CLAIMS>
A self standing flexible pouch for containing liquids having a top portion 
(FIG. 1,2) and a base portion (FIG. 1,3) comprising a front wall (FIG. 1,4) 

and back wall (FIG. 1,5) and a base wall (FIG. 1,6) generally 
perpendicular to said front and back walls when said pouch is filled in its 

upright position, and
 
said front and back walls being sealed together along their top edges (FIG. 

1,7 and 8) and their peripheral edges (FIG. 1:9, 10, 11, 12) only in said top 
portion and
 
said bottom wall being sealed to said front and back walls, 

in said base portion, along their peripheral edges (FIG. 2,30,30b) 
and along their bottom edges ( FIG. 2,24), forming with each bottom 

edge a bottom horizontal seal part (FIG. 
8,110),
 
said peripheral edges (FIG. 2,30,30b) of said front and back walls and 

said base wall in said base portion being substantially along oblique seals,
characterized in that
 said pouch further comprises a means to provide an 
outward unfolding of said bottom horizontal seal part when said pouch is 

filled, said means being achieved by the means selected from the group 
consisting of: 


(1) creasing said bottom horizontal seal part (FIG. 8, 110); 
(2) making the base wall (FIG 9, 140) of a stiffer material than for the 

front (FIG. 9, 120) and back walls (FIG. 9, 130); 
(3) creasing said bottom horizontal seal part and severing the bottom seal 
corners (FIG. 1,16 
&
 16a) between the oblique seal (FIG. 8,100) and 
the bottom horizontal seal (FIG. 8, 110) in an oblique manner; 
(4) creasing said bottom horizontal seal part and making the base wall of 
a stiffer material than for the front and back walls;  

 
(5) severing the bottom seal corners between the oblique seal and the 
bottom horizontal seal in an oblique manner and making the base wall 

of a stiffer material than for the front and back walls; 
(6) creasing said bottom horizontal seal part and severing the bottom seal 
corners between the oblique seal and the bottom horizontal seal in an 

oblique manner and making the base wall of a stiffer material than for 
the front and back walls. 
A self-standing flexible pouch according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stiffer material is achieved by using a different material for the base 

wall (FIG. 9,140). 
A self-standing flexible pouch according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that a stiffer material is achieved by laminating with a thicker structure to 

said base wall (FIG. 9,140). 
A self standing flexible pouch according to any of the preceding claims, 
further characterized in that the obtuse angle (FIG. 1, β) between the 

inner edge of the oblique peripheral seal of the front or back wall in the 
base portion and the perpendicular axes is between 120° and 150°. 
A self-standing flexible pouch according to any of the preceding claims,

least one ridge (FIG. 1,15), preferably four ridges parallel with the 
perpendicular axes extending from the bottom edge corner (FIG. 1, 16,

supplying a reel (FIG. 7,17) of a flattened tube of plastic material of which 
both edges are folded in a manner such that each edge forms a V shape, 
placing two anti-adhesive screens (FIG. 7, 21), the length of which is 
greater than the width of one pouch, said screens being disposed 

opposite each other inside the lateral folds of the tube.

the longitudinal seals, 
supplying a second set of electrodes (FIG. 7,23) to form the lateral seals,
