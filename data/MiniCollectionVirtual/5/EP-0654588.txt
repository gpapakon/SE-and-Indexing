<ABSTRACT>
A variable cam phaser (VCP) (18) is disclosed in 
various modifications. The VCP includes a piston 

(70) responsive to pressure in a fluid chamber (76) 
having an inlet orifice (130) and a plurality of 

outlets including a first outlet (146) and a 
plurality of second outlets (148, 150, 152). A valve 

slide (136) is movable to cover said second outlets 
one after another to pressurize the fluid chamber to 

displace the piston against a return spring (80). 
Outer and inner splined slides (56, 58) are drivingly 

mated with an internal helical spline (40) of a 
cylindrical body (3) secured to a sprocket (20) and 

an external helical spline (46) of a stub shaft (42) 
secured to a camshaft (12). The splined slides (56, 

58) are disposed between the piston (70) and the 
return spring (80). Thus, movement of the piston and 

splined slides assembly in response to pressurization 
or depressurization of the fluid chamber advances or 

retards the valve timing or phase angle of the 
camshaft rel;ative to the sprocket (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable cam
phaser for an internal combustion engine according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.JP 3-53447 B2 discloses a variable cam phaser
for the angular adjustment of a camshaft with respect
to a drive wheel. By means of this variable cam
phaser, the angular adjustment is effected by an
annular piston. The annular piston has inner and
outer splines of varying lead. The annular piston is
slidably mounted in a hydraulic cylinder and defines
in the hydraulic cylinder a fluid chamber. The
piston is biased by a return spring. The annular
piston is axially movable. This movement of the
annular piston in the cylinder causes the drive and
driven members to undergo relative angular
displacement in a direction corresponding to the
direction of movement of the annular piston. The cam
phaser further includes valve means for pressurizing
the fluid chamber for displacing the annular piston
in one direction against the return spring or
depressurizing said fluid chamber for allowing said
return spring to displace the annular piston in the
opposite direction and thereby controlling the
relative angular position of the drive and driven
members, The annular piston is subject to the bias
of the return spring via a control sleeve so that the
control sleeve follows the axial movement of the
annular piston. The control sleeve has an axial bore
which constitutes an inlet or an outlet always open
to the fluid chamber. The control sleeve has an
inner peripheral wall formed with an inner 
circumferential groove communicating with the axial
bore. The inner peripheral wall of the control
sleeve defines a space communicating with a drainage.
The driven member has an inner circumferential
transfer groove and bores connecting the transfer
groove to a source of fluid pressure. The transfer
groove is wide enough to maintain fluid flow
communication with a radial bore extending through
the control sleeve during axial movement of the
annular piston. This radial bore terminates in a
port, namely, a supply port, with which the inner
peripheral wall of the control sleeve is formed. The
valve means includes a spool slidably mounted in the
control sleeve. The spool has a circumferential
groove adjacent a land. The circumferential groove
of the spool is kept in communication with the supply
port to receive fluid pressure, while the land covers
the inner circumferential groove of the control
sleeve. Shifting the spool in one direction causes
the land to uncovers the inner circumferential

piston in said cylinder causing said drive and driven members to undergo
relative angular displacement in a direction corresponding to the direction of

the movement of said piston,
and valve means (136;360) for depressurizing said fluid chamber for displacing
said piston wherein said valve means (136;360) has a first end position

allowing said piston to take one extreme position thereof under the bias of said
return spring and said valve means (136;360) has a second end position

wherein said second outlet is closed to pressurize said fluid chamber,
displacing said piston against said return spring to the opposite extreme
position thereof and thereby controlling relative angular position of said drive

and driven members,
characterized in that

a plurality of outlets (146,148,150,152;366,368,370,372) are provided for
