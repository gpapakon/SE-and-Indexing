<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a switching arrangement having a housing (1, 2) for accommodating and for switching load interrupter switches, and having connecting block operation. The invention has the object of structurally and functionally improving such an arrangement. In particular, it is intended to be capable of being used for accommodating and switching load interrupter switches of different construction, and of reducing storage. To this end, it is initially provided according to the invention that two connecting blocks (3) are arranged side by side and parallel to one another in a common housing (1, 2) and that both connecting blocks can be operated, that is to say can be displaced.

the longitudinal direction, characterized in that the two 
connecting blocks (3) are disposed side-by-side and 

parallel to one another in a common housing (1, 2) with 
a spatial separation from one another, and in that one of 

the connecting blocks is designed to open and close a set 
of connecting contacts (5, 6) with the switching contacts 

(7) it carries and the other connecting block (3) is 
designed to open and close a further set of connecting 

contacts (5, 6) with the switching contacts (7) it 
carries. 
Load-switching arrangement according to Claim 1,

6) is situated in the conductors of a conductor system 
and the further set of connecting contacts (5, 6) is 

situated in the conductors of a further conductor system. 
Load-switching arrangement according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the spacings of the regions to 

be contacted of the connecting contacts (5, 6) of the 
load switch are equal to the spacings between the 

switching contacts (7). 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that four connecting 

contacts (5, 6) are provided on one load switch, in that 
each connecting block has switching contacts or 

switching-contact pairs (7) for each phase with which it 
switches two of the abovementioned switching contacts (5,  

 
6), and in that a common switching-actuation system (4) 

is provided which displaces the two connecting blocks. 
Load-switching arrangement according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the connecting blocks (3) are 

displaced synchronously and in opposite directions by 
means of the switching-actuation system (4). 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the longitudinal 

direction of a fuse (9, 9') extends transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the connecting blocks. 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the connecting 

blocks (3) are detachably accommodated in the housing (1, 
2) and can be removed from the open housing independently 

of one another. 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the connecting 

blocks (3) are disposed at a distance from one another. 
Load-switching arrangement according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that a spring-loaded switching mechanism 

(4) having a square switching shaft actuation system (14) 
is provided centrally between the connecting blocks in 

the spacing between the two connecting blocks (3). 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4 and 6 to 9, characterized in that a 

separate switching-actuation system is provided for every 
connecting block (3). 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 

Claims 1 to 9, characterized by a switching-actuation 
system in the form of a spring-loaded switching mechanism  

 
(4) having two switching arms (11) which terminate in 

driver lugs (12) which engage in recesses (13) of the 
respective connecting block (3). 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the switching-actuation 

system has a switching path whose operation is 
advanced in time with respect to the operation of the 

spring-loaded switching system and which automatically 
displaces the connecting blocks by a relatively short 

section. 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4 and 6 to 12, characterized by a switching-actuation 

system (4) and an associated arrangement of 
connecting blocks (3) which are such that one of the 

connecting blocks is first moved into the required 
position and it is only after completion of this 

displacement that the other of the two connecting blocks 
is moved into its new switch position. 
Load-switching arrangement according to one of
