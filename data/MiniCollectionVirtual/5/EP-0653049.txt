<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for measuring the thickness of a coating on paper (12) coated by means of a blade-like element (20) which applies the coating composition to a web of paper (12) as it passes over a roller. The invention calls for the deviation of the blade (20) to be continuously determined near the blade tip (36) by non-contact measurement. This enables the distance from the blade edge to the surface of the paper (12) to be continuously determined by simple trigonometric calculation and, from the fixed relationship between this distance and the coating thickness, the coating thickness to be continuously determined in the immediate vicinity of the applicator (18, 26). The invention also concerns a device designed to carry out the method and a particular use of this device for the simultaneous determination of the viscosity of the coating compound.
