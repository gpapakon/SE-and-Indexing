<ABSTRACT>
Device for monitoring the ripening of cheese in a ripening store taking the form of shelves on which cheese (3) can ripen, having a plurality of storage positions (4, 4') which are formed on at least one shelf (1, 2), are intended to permit storage of the cheese (3) while it is ripening and have at least one testing device (8) which is assigned to at least one group of storage positions (4, 4') and is to be used to monitor or observe the level and/or the raising of the level of the cheese (3) stored in the storage positions (4, 4').

<CLAIMS>
Device for the monitoring of the ripening process of 
cheese, by inspecting the cheese with a testing device (8, 

8
1
 - 8
n
), distinguished by the fact that the device is 
suitable for the monitoring of
 the ripening process in 
storage positions (4, 4') of a ripening store taking the 

form of a shelved area, which has these storage positions 
(4, 4') on at least one shelf (1, 2, 2'), that the testing 

device is constructed to check on a group of storage 
positions (4, 4') simultaneously, preferably on all those 

on at least one shelf (1, 2, 2'), and can be moved from 
storage position to storage position, and that the 

monitoring of the ripening process takes place by means of 
checking or monitoring the height of the cheese. 
Device as Claim 1, distinguished by the fact that the 
testing device (8, 8
1
 - 8
n
) is provided on a shelf control 
unit (7). 
Device as Claim 1 or 2, distinguished by the fact that the 
testing device is an opto-electrical testing device (8, 8
1
 -8
n
) 
or an ultra-sonic height gauging or checking device. 
Device as Claim 3, distinguished by the fact that the 
testing device is, for example, a light barrier (8, 8
1
 -8
n
), 
and / or a video device with image comparison and / or 

a laser-supported gauging device (21, 23, 24) for an 
interval measurement. 
Device as one of the preceding claims, distinguished by the 
fact that, with the testing device taking the form of an 

opto-electrical device, at least one reflector (10) is 
provided, preferably at the back of each storage position. 
Device as one of Claims 1 - 5, distinguished by containers 
(5) to receive the cheese, with at least one testing device 

(8, 8
1
 - 8
n
) monitoring the height of the cheese (3) in the 
container and / or the height of the cheese projecting  

 
above the container (5), and / or an edge or surface (14) 

determining the height of the cheese (3). 
Device as one of Claims 1 - 6, distinguished by a means of 
altering the level of the internal base of the containers 

(5), with the means of altering the level of the internal 
surface of the container base preferably taking the form of 

insert elements or frames which can be inserted into the 
containers and removed from them. 
Device as one of Claims 1 - 7, distinguished by the fact 
that different height positions can be registered with at 

least one testing device (8
1
 - 8
n
), with the testing 
device(s) preferably being mobile in the vertical direction 

and / or combining several individual testing devices, 
preferably several light paths (8
1
 - 8
n
) at different 
heights on the same vertical line. 
Device as one of Claims 1 - 8, distinguished by the fact 
that each storage position (4') has a position depth or 

shelf depth which can accomodate several storage units, and 
that the height or the increase in height of the cheese (3) 

in all the storage units of a storage position (4') is 
simultaneously monitored. 
Device as one of Claims 1 - 9, distinguished by the fact 

that the gauging device (21) is mounted on a bracket or arm 
(20) held on the shelf control unit (7), with which the 

gauging device (21) can be moved between the initial 
position away from the shelf (1, 2, 2') or the storage 

positions there (4, 4') and at least one operating position 
above a storage position (4, 4') or above the surface to be 

monitored (17),
 
and / or 
that the gauging device (23) is provided on the shelf 
control unit (7), with a mirror (22) being fixed to a 

bracket or arm (20) held on the shelf control unit, which 
can be moved between an initial position, in which the 

mirror is located away from the shelf (1, 2, 2') or the  
 

storage positions there (4, 4') and at least one operating 
position, in which the mirror (22) is mounted above a 

storage position (4, 4') or above the surface to be 
monitored (17), and with the mirror (22) serving to reflect 

a signal carrying out the measurement, going from the 
gauging device (23), to the surface to be monitored, (17) 

and to reflect the signal going back from this surface (17) 
to the gauging device (23),
 
and / or 
that the gauging device (24) is permanently mounted above 
a positioning surface (7') of the shelf control unit (7), 

with a means being provided of positioning the cheese (3) 
to be monitored below the gauging device (24) on the 

positioning surface (7') for monitoring or gauging,
 
and / or 
that the testing device has at least one video-camera (16), 
with which at least the surface (17) to be monitored is 

covered, together with at least one evaluation device or 
electronic unit (19) for an evaluation of the signal 

supplied by the video-camera (16), preferably by means of 
image comparison, with the video-camera (16) preferably 

being provided on the shelf control unit (7) and the 
optical axis of the video-camera (16) being aligned 

obliquely from above onto the surface (17) to be monitored. 
Conditioning store in the form of a shelved area for the 
ripening of cheese, with several storage positions (4, 4') 

on at least one shelf (1, 2, 2') for the storage of the 
cheese (3) during the ripening process, and with at least 

one device as one of Claims 1 - 8.
