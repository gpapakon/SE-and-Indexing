and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which have
antimicrobial activities (especially, antifungal activities), inhibitory
activity on β-1,3-glucan synthase, and further which are expected
to be useful for the treatment or prevention of Pneumocystiscarinii
infection (e.g. Pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia) in human being
and animals, to a process for preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical
composition comprising the same, and to a method for treating or
preventing infectious diseases including Pneumocystiscarinii infection
(e.g. Pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia) in human being and animals.Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide
the polypeptide compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt

polypeptide compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.Still further object of the present invention is to provide
a method for treating or preventing infectious diseases including
Pneumocystiscarinii infection (e.g. Pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia)
caused by pathogenic microorganisms, which comprises administering
said polypeptide compound to human being or animals.The object polypeptide compound of the present invention
is novel and can be represented by the following general formula
[I] :

wherein
R1,R2,R3,R4,R5, R6

are each as defined in claim 1.EP-A-0 462 531 is related to cyclic polypeptides with antibiotic activity.EP-A-0 448 354 is also related to antibiotic lipopeptides.The polypeptide compound [I] of the present invention

scheme. 
Wherein
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are each as defined above ,R 3 / a
 is acyloxy,R 4 / a
 is hydroxysulfonyloxy,R 5 / a
 is C1-C6 alkyl which may have 1-3 suitable
substituent (s) as defined for R5,R 6 / a
 is hydroxy, or acyl (C1-C6) alkylthio,R 6 / b
 is acyl (C1-C6) alkylthio, R 6 / c
 is hydroxy.Suitable
