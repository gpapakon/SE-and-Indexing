<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a diffusor produced in a sheet-metal type of construction and intended for multi-stage centrifugal pumps, a shaped sheet-metal part being provided with at least two or more integrally formed blades, it being possible to manipulate this shaped sheet-metal part in a simple manner and to connect it to other components of the diffusor. Welding projections already integrally formed on the blades serve to facilitate the connection to the other components.

<CLAIMS>
Diffuser device for centrifugal pumps of multistage 
type of construction, the diffuser device imparting 

energy to the delivery medium which discharges from an 
impeller and/or directing the delivery medium to a 

further pump stage, and the blades (2) of the diffuser 
device (1) being designed as sheet-metal formed parts, 

the blades (2) of the diffuser device being an integral 
part of a sheet-metal formed part (1, 6), at least two or 

more blades (2) being bent out of the sheet-metal formed 
part (1, 6), characterized in that the blades (2) are 

provided with integrally formed welding projections (3). 
Diffuser device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at least two blades (2) are connected to one 

another by a surface (5, 7). 
Diffuser device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that surfaces (5, 7) adjoining the 

blades (2) are provided with clearance cuts (8) for 
bearing surfaces (9) and/or welding projections (10) 

integrally formed on the blades (2).
