<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing safe human transfusion blood comprising separating whole human blood into cell concentrate and plasma, or, optionally, serum from such blood, passing the plasma, or, optionally, serum from such blood, into contact with solid polymer-iodine complex to add iodine to the plasma, or, optionally, serum from such blood, and reconstituting whole blood or serum suspended blood cells, from the thus treated plasma, or, optionally, serum from such blood, and the cell concentrate and holding the reconstituted blood composition for a period to permit inactivation of pathogenic microbes before transfusing the reconstituted blood into a patient, and the product of said process, are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SAFE HUMAN TRANSFUSION BLOODBackground of the Invention This invention relates to human transfusion blood, and derivatives thereof. Iodine was officially recognized by the Pharmacopeia of the United States in 5 1930, also as tincture iodine (tincture of iodine) and linimentum iodi (liniment of iodine). Clinicians and microbiologists described a great number of experimental data and clinical applications. Despite the successes that have been achieved with iodine, it was ascertained early that it also possesses properties imsuitable for practical application. 10 Although exact details about the killing of a living cell by the I2 molecule(or one of the reaction products occurring in aqueous solution) are not known, it can be assumed that iodine reacts with basic N-H functions that are parts of some amino acids (e.g., lysine, histidine, arginine) and the bases of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, and guanine) forming the corresponding N-iododerivatives. By this reaction, 15 important positions for hydrogen bonding are blocked, and a lethal disorder of the protein structure may occur. Iodine oxidizes the S-H group of the amino acid cysteine, through which the connections of protein chains by disulfide (-S-S-) bridges, as an important factor in the synthesis of proteins, are lost. Iodine reacts with the phenolic group of the amino acid tyrosine, forming mono- or diiodo-derivatives. In 20 this case, the bulk of the iodine atom(s) in the ortho position may cause a form of steric hindrance in the hydrogen bonding of the phenolic OH group and with the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) of the unsaturated fatty acids. This could lead to a change in the physical properties of the lipids and membrane immobilization. Iodine - polymer complexes, e.g., with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and 25 complexes of iodine with nonionic surfactants, eg, polyethylene glycol Î¹nono(nonylphenyl) ether have been used with considerable success. However, use in direct contact with labile biological materials has been limited because either the ^ killing power of iodine is dissipated in the biological material or damages the biological material. ~~'* 30 Iodine is capable, in certain circumstances, of killing all classes of pathogens encountered in nosocomial infections: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa. Most bacteria are killed within 15 

to 30 seconds of contact. Iodine is generally considered to be an excellent, prompt, effective microbicide with a broad range of action that
