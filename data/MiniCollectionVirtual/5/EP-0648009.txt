<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oscillating circuit. More
particularly, the invention relates to an oscillating circuit
which improves the stability characteristics of the oscillating
output signal. Applications of such an oscillator includes
incorporation of the oscillator in radio wave key systems used
for the remote control of automobile equipment.Recently, the use of radio systems utilizing radio waves for
short distance transmission of information has increased
dramatically. One example of this in the field of automobile
related technology is the so-called "radio wave key system".
Such systems typically operate by emitting a radio wave in the
ultra high frequency (UHF) band from a transmitter incorporated
in the ignition key. An automobile installed receiver then
receives the radio wave and enables the control of such operations
as, for example, door locking, engine starting, etc., at
a location remote from the automobile.The transmitters of these types of radio wave key systems
typically incorporate an oscillator 52 that uses a crystal
resonator 51 as shown in Fig. 3. The oscillator 52 oscillates
the radio wave of several tens of MHz. A frequency multiplier 
53 multiplies the oscillating frequency of the radio wave to
obtain a desired high frequency (several hundreds of MHz). The
high frequency thus obtained is amplified by an amplifier 54
in order to radiate it from an antenna 55.Since the transmitter used in a radio wave key system is
designed to be incorporated in the ignition key, it is
desirable to keep the size of the transmitter as small as
possible. More particularly, the number of the transmitter's
component parts should be minimized and the structure of
circuits should be kept simple in order to minimize the costs
associated with the transmitter's manufacture. One response
to the need for such a transmitter has in the past been the
production of oscillators that utilize a surface acoustic wave
resonator (hereinafter abbreviates as SAW resonator). SAW
resonators have the advantage of small size and low cost over
conventional electromagnetic structure.The one port SAW resonator shown in Fig. 5 comprises a comb-shaped
electrode 20 formed by a thin metallic film on a
substrate made of a piezoelectric material, and a pair of
grating reflectors 21 and 22 positioned on both sides of the
electrode. An external terminal 23 is connected to the comb-shaped
electrode 20. The electric signals input to the comb-shaped
electrode 20 through the external terminal 23 are
excited by the comb-shaped
