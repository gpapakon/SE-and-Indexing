<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a pre-slit cannula needle (10) with longitudinal (12) break lines (18) preferably located diametrically opposite each other. Also proposed is a method of producing said cannula. The break lines (18) are formed by chipless forming techniques.

<CLAIMS>
Slit cannula (10) made of metal, having at least one 
predetermined breaking line (18, 20) extending in a 

longitudinal direction,
 
characterized in that
 
the predetermined breaking line (18, 20) is manufactured 

by non-cutting shaping. 
Slit cannula according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the predetermined breaking lines (18, 20) are perforated. 
Slit cannula according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the slit cannula (10) in the region immediately adjacent 

to the predetermined breaking line (18, 20) has a greater 
wall thickness than the wall thickness of the cannula 

itself. 
Slit cannula (10) made of metal, having a peripherally 
closed cannula body, an integrally ground cannula tip 

(12) and a handle (14, 16) provided in the end region 
remote from the cannula tip for the purpose of at least 

partially splitting open the cannula body along two 
predetermined breaking lines (18, 20) extending in a 

longitudinal direction of the cannula body, characterized 
in that the predetermined breaking lines (18, 20) are 

formed in the cannula body by non-cutting shaping. 
Method of manufacturing at least one predetermined 
breaking line (18, 20) extending in a longitudinal 

direction of a metal slit cannula (10) through working of 
a cannula body,
 
characterized in that
 
the predetermined breaking line (18, 20) is manufactured 

by a non-cutting shaping process.  
 
Method according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
acting in a longitudinal direction of the cannula body 

upon the outer wall (32) thereof is a stamping tool (34, 
36), associated with which is a counter-tool (30) 

extending inside the tube. 
Method according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
two predetermined breaking lines (18, 20) are impressed 

successively into the tube wall (32) by rotating the 
cannula (10) through an angle Î±. 
Method according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
two predetermined breaking lines (18, 20) are impressed 

simultaneously into the peripherally closed cannula body. 
Method according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
a tool (34, 36) having a stamping edge for forming the 

predetermined breaking line (18, 20) extends in a 
longitudinal direction and over the length of the metal 

cannula body, that the stamping edge (48) in relation to 
a plane of symmetry, in which the longitudinal axis (12) 

extends, has lateral raised portions (56, 58) which 
extend in the direction of the cannula body and verge 

into a projection (64), which is V-shaped in cross-section, 
has a tip (70) and is formed symmetrically to 

the plane of symmetry, the distance between a line (66) 
tangentially touching the raised portion and the tip (70) 

substantially determining the depth (t) of the 
predetermined breaking line.
