<ABSTRACT>
The protection of the straight edges of multilayer panels (10), such as heat-shield panels of a spacecraft, is provided by an adhesive protective strip (14) comprising two adhesive lateral zones bonded to the faces of the panel and a non-adhesive zone (18) placed on the edge of the panel. After removing a non-adhesive protection (30b), a first adhesive lateral zone (20b) is brought onto a working plane (22), through a slot (32), and progressively bonded to the lower face of a panel (10) moving in this plane. The second adhesive lateral zone is then folded over and pressed against the upper face of the panel, after which the non-adhesive protection (30a) of this zone is removed.

Process for bonding an adhesive protective edging (14) to a straight 
edge of a multilayer panel (10), the edging (14) having a central, non-adhesive 

strip (18) and two lateral, adhesive zones (20a, 20b), said process 
comprising the following stages: 


bonding the first lateral, adhesive zone (20b) of the edging (14) to a 
first face of the panel, along the straight edge, by depositing said first 

face of the panel (10) on a working plane (22), unwinding the edging from a 
storage reel (28), removing a first anti-adhesive protector (30b) covering 

the first lateral, adhesive zone, bringing the latter between the working 
plane and the first face of the panel through a notch (32) formed in the 

straight edge (23) of the working plane (22) so that it is in contact with 
said first face along the straight edge of the panel and simultaneous 

advance of the panel and the first lateral, adhesive zone on the working 
plane, 
application of a pressure to the panel (10) along the straight edge, 
bending the edging (14) in such a way that the second adhesive, lateral 
zone (20a) of the latter, covered with a second anti-adhesive protector 

(30a) is bent onto the opposite face of the panel and 
removing the second anti-adhesive protector (30a) whilst maintaining a 
pressure on the panel, along the straight edge. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the straight edge 
of the panel (10) is guided during its advance on the working plane (22), 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the bending 
of the edging (14)
 is performed after the cutting of its ends, the panel 
(10) being stationary on the working plane. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the bending of 
the edging (14) is performed progressively during the advance of the panel 

(10) on the working plane (22), following the bonding of the first lateral, 
adhesive zone. 
Machine for bonding an adhesive protection edging (14) to a straight  
 

edge of a multilayer panel, the edging (14) having a non-adhesive, central 
strip (18) and two lateral, adhesive zones (20a, 20b), said machine comprising: 


a working plane (22) able to receive the panel, 
a reel (28) for storing the adhesive protective edging (14), placed below 
the working plane, 
a means for removing a first anti-adhesive protector (30b) covering the 
first lateral, adhesive zone (20b) of the edging on leaving the storage 

reel, 
a slit (32) formed in the working plane (22), for the passage of the 
first lateral zone on the working plane, at a location below a first face of 

the panel, along the straight edge, 
means (38) for applying pressure to the panel resting on the working 
plane, along the straight edge, 
means (34, 54) for bending the edging on the opposite face of the panel 
and 
a means for removing a second anti-adhesive protector (30a) covering the 
second, lateral, adhesive zone (20a) of the edging. 
Machine according to claim 5, characterized in that it comprises a 
lateral guide (24) against which is placed the straight edge of the panel 

upstream of the slot (32) formed in the working plane. 
Machine according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the edging 
bending means comprise a bending hinge (34) articulated on the working 

plane downstream of said slot (32). 
Machine according to claim 7, characterized in that the pressure 
application means comprise a rule (38) which can be placed above the working 

plane (22) in front of the bending hinge (34). 
Machine according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the edging 
bending means comprise a bending guide (54) fixed to the working plane (22) 

so as to ensure a progressive bending of the edging during its advance on 
the working plane.  

 
Machine according to claim 9, characterized in that the bending means 
also comprise a bending roller (56) pressing the second lateral, adhesive 

zone (20a) of the edging against the opposite face of the panel (10) downstream 
of the bending guide (54) and upstream of a means (58) for removing 

the second anti-adhesive protector. 
Machine according to claim 10, characterized in that it comprises a 
bonding roller (60) pressing the second lateral, adhesive zone (20a) of the 

edging (14) against the opposite face of the panel (10) downstream of the 
means (58) for removing the second anti-adhesive protector. 
Machine according to claim 11, characterized in that the cutting means 
(62) are positioned downstream of the bonding roller (60). 
Machine according to any one of the claims 9 to 12, characterized in 
that the pressure application means comprise a pressing block (38) placed 

above the working plane (22), along the straight edge of the panel and 
extending downstream to the vicinity of a downstream end of the bending 

guide (54).
