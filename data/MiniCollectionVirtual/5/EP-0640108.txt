<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a liquid crystalline polymer which is optically anisotropic in the melt state and which, as far as its molecular weight is concerned, is suitable for melt processing, a process for preparing such a polyester, and products prepared from the polyester. According to the invention a liquid crystalline polymer is provided, containing a structural unit of formula (I), wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, phenyl, which optionally is substituted with one or more halogens or lower alkyls, or benzyl, which optionally is substituted with one or more halogens or lower alkyls, and R5 and R6 represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, or benzyl, with the proviso that if one of them is something else than hydrogen then the other one is hydrogen, n is an integer from 0 to 5. The glass transition temperature of the polyester according to the invention is higher than 90  DEG C and its forms an anisotropic mesophase at temperatures below 300  DEG C, which makes it possible to use the polyester for preparing polymer blends with conventional matrix polymers, in particular with polyolefins. High-strength constructional parts can be manufactured from the polyester.

<DESCRIPTION>
Melt-processable liquid crystalline polyester, process for the preparation thereof and products prepared from the polyesterThe present invention relates to a liquid crystalline polyester, which is optically aniso¬ tropic in the melt phase and which has a molecular weight which makes it suitable for melt processing. The invention also relates to a process for preparing such a polyester as well as to products prepared from the polyester.Liquid crystalline polyesters, i.e. polyesters which in the melt state are optically anisotropic, are well known in the art. Liquid crystalline polyesters are described in numerous patent publications and some of them are mentioned in, for instance, the following articles: Jackson, W.J. Jr. , Liquid Crystal polymers. XI. Liquid Crystal Aromatic Polyesters: Early History and Future Trends. Mol. Crvst. Liq. Crvst, 169 (1989) 23-49, and Noel, C. and Navard, P. , Liquid Crystal Polymers, Prog. Polvm.Sci. 16 (1991) 55-110. The prior art is also represented by U.S. Patent Specifications Nos. 4,600,764, 4,599,395 and 4,083,829.The strength and stiffness of many thermoplastics can be considerably improved by mixing them with liquid crystalline polymers. The liquid crystalline polymer forms fibres which align in the direction of the melt flow of the thermoplastic polymer matrix, thus improving the mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and modulus of elasticy, in this direction. By adding liquid crystalline polymers it is often also possible to improve the heat resistance and the dimensional stability of thermoplastics and to make the processing of them easier.The known liquid crystalline aromatic polyesters are. however, hampered by the problem that their melt and processing temperatures are often too high for them to be processed together with thermoplastics and to be used in blends with these polymers. This is true for the aromatic polyesters disclosed by the above-mentioned U.S. PatentSpecifications as well as for the commercially available thermotropic polyesters marketed under the product names "Vectra" (supplied by Hoechst-Celanese) and "Xydar" (supplied by Amoco). 

Polymers prepared by the transesterification method are discussed in the U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,804,805 and in the article by Jackson, W.J., Jr. and Kuhfuss, EL F. in J. Polvm. Sci. Polvm. Chem. Ed. 14 (1976) 2043. The polymers form an anisotropic mesophase at temperatures above 220 °C. The disadvantage of these known polymers resides in their low glass transition temperatures.
