<ABSTRACT>
A new crystalline modification of 2,4-dioxo-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine is disclosed, characterized by the 
interplanar distances (d) and relative reflex intensity (I). The process for obtaining the said substance involves using a cooling 

agent to cool a solution of 2,4-dioxo-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine in water, an organic solvent or a mixture of both, at 
a rate of at least 6 °C per minute until the solution has completely crystallized. The crystals obtained are then removed and 

dried. The substance claimed has anti-inflammatory properties and promotes the healing of wounds and is the active 
substance in a preparation used in treating burns and wounds of various types.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to organic chemistry 
or, more exactly to a new crystalline modification 
of 2,4-dioxo-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine, 
a method for the preparation thereof, and a 
medicinal preparation based on it. There is a known crystalline form of 2,4-dioxo-6- methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine (SU, A, 
194096) characterized by the following set of values 
of interplane spacings d and relative intensities 
of reflexes I: 
d, Å I 1 2 8.00517 5.4979 5.315100 4.1054 4.0042 3.64838 3.41116 3.3323 3.16923 3.1104 2.8053 2.7231 2.6673 2.6133  2.56927 2.4691 2.3821 2.3401 2.27511 1.9293 1.8671 1.8282 1.7125 1.6401 1.5991 1.5881 The said crystalline form of 2,4-dioxo-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine 
is prepared by crystallization 
of the said compound out of its aqueous solution. 
The resulting product is a white crystalline 
powder poorly soluble in water and ethyl alcohol, insoluble 
in ether, chloroform, characterized by the 
above-described values of interplane spacings d and 
relative intensities of reflexes I. This compound posessing 
the antiinflammatory and wound healing effect 
is characterized by insufficiently high effectiveness, 
toxicity, and induction of side effects. The said compound finds an application as the 
active substance of a medicinal preparation for treatment 
of wounds, burns, bone fractures, X-ray disease, 
leukopenia, gastric and duodenal ulcer, hepatitis, 
pancreatitis and others (M.D. Mashkovsky, Pharmaceuticals, 
1984, Medizina Publishers, Moscow, v. 2, 
p.138). For instance, there is a known pharmaceutical  
 
containing the said compound as the active substance 
used for treatment of pure postoperation wounds by 
the intramuscular or oral routes (G. L. Bilich - 
Stimulation of regeneration and defence mechanisms 
in infantile surgery, 1976, Medizina Publishers, 
Moscow, p. 31-32). The intramuscular inoculation of the drug facilitates 
the spread of the greater part of the drug 
in other tissues and organs as a result of which no 
necessary topical concentration of the drug is achieved 
resulting in no efficacy of the treatment. After oral administration of the drug part of 
it is destroyed in the stomach and no necessary concentration 
of the drug in the area of the wound is 
achieved either. This does not create a sufficient 
wound-healing effect of the drug and prolongs the 
period of treatment. There is known pharmaceutical containing as the 
active substance the said compound in the form of 
5-10% liniment for topical treatment of wounds
