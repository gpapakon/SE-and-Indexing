<ABSTRACT>
Modular panel for making a conductor network comprising at least three layers (24, 26, 28) of insulating material and at least two layers (20, 22) of conducting material separated by the insulating material layers, the panel being designed to receive at least one apparatus (10) fitted with penetrating connection pins (14, 16) each provided with at least one conducting area, whose length and number are adapted to the conductive layers to be reached, the panel being characterized in that it is comprised of a peripheral frame having elements provided with mechanical linking parts forming electric connection members, the elements of the frame being themselves connected to the corresponding layers of conducting material so as to achieve the connection between modular panels. The invention also relates to the connectors used therewith as well as to methods for fabricating such panels.
