<DESCRIPTION>
A process for the preparation of 2-(pyridyl)ethyl 
substituted phosphorus compounds, by contacting a 
vinylpyridine and a phosphorus compound in the presence 
of a silicon halide, a protic acid, or a selected Lewis 
acid. Also provided are novel 2-(pyridyl)ethyl 
(bis)silylphosphonates and their use as catalysts in 
increasing the molecular weight of polyamides. The reaction of dihydrocarbylphosphites with a 
variety of olefinic unsaturated organic compounds, so 
that a phosphorus-carbon bond is formed, is known in the 
art, see for background for example: X. Lu and J. Zhu, 
Synthesis, p. 563-564 (1986); G. Optiz, et. al., Ann., 
vol. 665, p. 91-101 (1963); I. Tyurenkov, et. al., Khim. 
Farm. Zh., vol. 22, p. 170-174 (1988); V. Shchepin, 
et. al., Zh. Obshch. Khim., vol. 57, p. 2144 (1987); and 
V. Ovchinnikov, et. al., Zh. Obshch. Khim., vol. 54, 
p. 1916-1917 (1984). None of these disclose the use of 
vinylpyridines in such reactions. E. Maruszewska-Wieczorkowska and J. Michalski, J. 
Org. Chem., vol. 23, p. 1886-1889 (1958) report the 
synthesis of various 2-(pyridyl)phosphonates by the 
reaction of a vinylpyridine with a dialkyl phosphite, 
optionally with a sodium ethoxide catalyst. Without the 
catalyst, it was reported that yields were lower, and 
considerable amounts of polymeric substances were 
formed. Sodium ethoxide, the catalyst used by these 
authors, is a base, and no mention is made of the use of 
halogen containing or acidic catalysts, as used herein.  
 E. Boyd, et. al., Tet. Lett., vol. 31, p. 2933-2936 
(1990), report the reaction of triethylammonium 
phosphinate, trimethylchlorosilane, and alpha,beta-unsaturated 
ester (such as an acrylate) resulted in the 
formation of (beta-ester)alkyl substituted phosphonic 
acid. Bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinite was postulated as 
an intermediate. However, only alpha-beta unsaturated 
esters are reported to be suitable reactants. Similarly, J. K. Thottahil, et. al., Tet. Lett., 
vol. 25, p. 4741-4744 (1984), reports that phosphonous 
esters in the presence of trimethylchlorosilane, and 
triethylamine react with substrates suitable for Michael 
addition type reactions (i.e., alpha, beta unsaturated 
esters and aldehydes) to give various addition products 
to the phosphonous ester. Depending on the reactants, 
1,2 or 1,4 addition was obtained. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide 
could be used in place of 
trimethylchlorosilane. No mention is made in this paper 
of using amines, such as a vinylpyridine, as substrates. M-P. Teulade and P. Savignac,
