<ABSTRACT>
Dusty and/or finely divided solids which arise in the purification of flue gases, in particular from refuse incineration plants, are subjected to a thermal treatment. In the course of this the said solids are fed to a filter device along a predetermined transport path by means of a gas stream having at least the temperature of the thermal treatment. After filtration, the solids can be subjected to a thermal post-treatment. The thermal treatment can serve for destruction of halogenated, in particular aromatic, hydrocarbons for removing ammonia or other volatile constituents.

A method for the heat treatment of pulverulent and/or
finely divided solids which are produced in the purification of

flue gases, in particular from refuse incineration plants, characterized
in that the pulverulent and/or finely divided solids

are heated and fed to a filtering apparatus along a predetermined
conveyance path by means of a gas flow having at least the

heat treatment temperature, and that after the filtering, the
pulverulent and/or finely divided solid matter is removed.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
gas flow is carried in a circle.
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the flue gas cleared of the fly ash is used as

the gas flow.
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that halogenated, in particular aromatic hydrocarbons,

are destroyed in the pulverulent and/or finely divided
solids by the heat treatment, in which process the heat treatment

is followed after the filtering by a thermal aftertreatment
in a stationary state.
A method according to claim 4, characterized in that, following
the filtering, the thermal aftertreatment is effected by

means of a residence at the treatment temperature in an inert
gas atmosphere.
A method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
the pulverulent and/or finely divided solids are heated to over

300°C, preferably over 400°C, and that subsequently, the thermal
aftertreatment is effected over two, preferably over four hours

at the same temperature.
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that the
pulverulent and/or finely divided solids are kept after the

thermal aftertreatment in an inert gas atmosphere during their
removal.
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the heat treatment is effected at an oxygen concentration

of at most 3%.
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the pulverulent and/or finely divided solids are

quenched after the heat treatment. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that volatile constituents, in particular ammonia,

are removed from the pulverulent and/or finely divided solids by
means of the heat treatment.
A method according to claim 10, characterized in that the
heat treatment is effected at over 300°C.
A method according to claim 10 or 11, characterized in that
the gaseous ammonia obtained is dissolved in water, that mercury

is removed by means of an ion exchanger from the aqueous solution
obtained, and the mercury-free aqueous ammonia solution is

fed to the flue gas of the refuse incineration plant for reducing
nitrogen oxides.
An apparatus for operating the method according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized by a pipeline (3) connected

to a fan (15) and a heating appliance (4) for the gas, which
pipeline forms at the same time the conveyance path and the

treatment space for the pulverulent and/or finely divided solid
matter, into one end zone whereof there leads a feeder device

(2) for the solid matter, and whose other end is followed by a
filtering apparatus (6) with filters made of a material capable

of withstanding high temperatures.
An apparatus according to claim 13, characterized in that
following the filtering apparatus (6), a residence space (7) is

arranged, in which arrangement the filtering apparatus preferably
forms the end of a residence space (7) for the thermal

aftertreatment.
An apparatus according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in
that the pipeline (3) freely issues into the residence space (7)

ahead of the filtering apparatus (6).
An apparatus according to one of claims 13 to 15, characterized
in that it has a cleaning device (12) for the pipeline

(3) in the form of an annular plunger (12).
An apparatus according to one of claims 13 to 16, characterized
in that the pipeline (3) is arranged vertically, in

which arrangement, the feeder device leads into its upper end
zone, and the filtering apparatus follows at its bottom end.
