<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a method for selectively 
removing antimony and bismuth from an impure sulphuric acid solution containing 

at least 50 g/L of acid and some concentration of ferric ion (for example copper 

refinery electrolyte), is disclosed. The method involves contacting the impure 
solution with a sufficient quantity of finely divided metallic copper so as to 

prereduce all ferric ion present in the solution to the ferrous oxidation state. The 
prereduced solution is then contacted with a chelating resin. The method avoids 

the deleterious loading of ferric iron onto the ion exchange resin and prevents the 
return of excessive amounts of chloride ion with the purified electrolyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method for purifying 
concentrated sulphuric acid solutions, in particular a copper refinery electrolyte, 
by selectively removing antimony and bismuth ions from the solution through 
adsorption on a solid ion exchange resin. During the electrorefining of copper, impure copper anodes are 
electrochemically dissolved in an aqueous solution containing copper sulphate and 
sulphuric acid. At the same time, at the cathode, pure copper is deposited and 
subsequently recovered from the electrorefining cell. The objective of refining is 
to make a separation between impurities contained in the anode and final copper 
cathode product. Some impurities such as gold and silver are retained as a solid 
product, referred to as "slime", and subsequently physically recovered from the 
anode residue. Impurities like antimony and bismuth are partly collected in the 
solid product and partly dissolve into the copper sulphate - sulphuric acid solution. Small concentrations of antimony and bismuth impurities, as well 
as others, in the copper sulphate - sulphuric acid solutions can be tolerated up to 
a certain level. However, if allowed to increase in concentration past refinery  
 
specific limits, the copper cathode product will be contaminated with excessive 
amounts of antimony and bismuth. Additionally iron present in the impure copper 
anode will dissolve in the solution. Small concentrations of iron in the copper 
sulphate - sulphuric acid solution do not result in contamination of the copper 
cathode product. Iron is present in two oxidation states, ferrous (Fe²⁺) and ferric 
(Fe³⁺). The steady state levels of these impurities in refinery electrolyte vary 
depending on the composition of the copper anodes being treated and the specific 
refinery operating conditions. However, typical levels are of the order of 0.2-0.5 
g/L for antimony, 0.1-0.6 g/L for bismuth and 0.2-2.0 g/L for iron. In order to control the build-up of impurity ions in solution, 
refineries generally employ a purification process to remove the deleterious 
impurities. The process usually involves a multi-step electrolytic deposition of 
copper. As copper is depleted, antimony and bismuth, as well as arsenic, begin 
to co-deposit with the copper product. The contaminated copper product is then 
recovered and recycled for copper recovery. The solution, after substantial 
depletion of copper, antimony, arsenic and bismuth may then be subjected to 
further purification, for example, by evaporative
