<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural baler (1) comprises a duct (26) for the 
transportation of crop material to a bale case (10), wherein it 

is compressed into bales. Above the duct (26) is provided a 
loading means comprising a pair of cyclically rotating cranks 

(74), pivotably connected to a pair of levers (72) of a stuffing 
fork assembly (66). During operation the levers (72) are moved 

along journals (88) which fit in oblong slots (90) of said levers 
(72). The journals (88) are installed on pivotable members (94) 

which are forced upwardly in a first position against stop 
members (98, 100) by springs (99). Upon rotation of the cranks 

(74) the tines (70) of the fork follow a generally kidney-shaped 
path (92). When the tines enter the duct (26), the pivot members 

(94) are forced downwardly to a second position by the abutment 
of the journals (88) against plugs (106) in the slots (90), 

whereafter they are force upwardly by the cam member (102) of the 
cranks (74). The proper dimensioning and location of plugs (106) 

and pivot members (94) allows a substantial reduction of the peak 
speed of the tines (70) during the stuffing of the bale case 

(10). The forces applied the crop material to the stuffer 
mechanism are reduced accordingly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to agricultural balers for the
formation of bales of crop material, such as hay, straw or silage
in a bale chamber, and more particularly to the loading means for
the transportation of said material from within a duct to the
bale chamber.Terms such as "forward", "rearward", "left", "right", etc.,
when used in connection with the baler and/or components thereof
are determined with reference to, and facing in, the direction of
operative travel of the baler in the field.In a conventional baler, as exemplified in US-A-4.106.267,
hay, straw, silage or similar crop material that has been
previously cut, windrowed or swathed, is picked up from the
ground by a pick-up unit, fed into a duct by a packer unit and
loaded in successive batches or charges into an elongated bale
chamber by tines of a stuffer unit in timed sequence with a
reciprocating plunger. The plunger compresses the material into
bales and, at the same time, gradually advances the bales towards
the outlet of the bale chamber. As the bales reach a
predetermined length as determined by a metering device, a
knotter device is actuated which wraps cord, twine or other
flexible binding material around the bale and secures the ends of
the binding material together.The packer unit precompresses the crop material in the duct
against a backstop formed by the plunger, when closing off the
entrance of the bale chamber. The stuffer unit is designed to
quickly load charges of said crop material into the bale chamber
within the short interval during which the reciprocating plunger
clears the entrance of the bale chamber. Typically this is
accomplished by a fork assembly whereof the arms are rotatably
connected to cranks, said arms being provided with longitudinally
extending slots in which stationary journals are received. A
uniform revolution of the cranks makes the arms shift along and
pivot about the journals so that the tines of the fork travel
along a generally kidney-shaped path with a varying speed. The 
maximum or peak speed is obtained when the distance between the
connection to the cranks and the stationary journals reaches its
minimum, since the arms then act as levers with very close
fulcrum points. Such system permits a quick sweep of the material
behind the packer unit through the duct and to the entrance of
the bale chamber.This type of stuffer unit was originally designed for the
baling of dry, low density material such as straw or hay, but
meanwhile there has been an important shift in agriculture from
the use of
