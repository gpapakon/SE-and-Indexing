<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to nuts and nut products which have at least a portion of their natural fat replaced with a low calorie fat-like material. This is achieved by partially defatting the nuts and then either contacting them or combining (i.e., mixing) them with a non-disgestible or partially digestible triglyceride material which includes a triglyceride bearing one long chain fatty acid residue and two short chain fatty acid residues. The resulting nuts and nut products have the organoleptic character of full fat nuts and nut products but a much lower calorie content.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS OF MAKING LOW CALORIE NUT PRODUCTSThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending application entitled "Low Calorie Nuts With The Organoleptic Character of Full Fat Nuts", Serial No. 07/731,845, filed in the names of Holloway, Finley, and Wheeler on July 16, 1991; and copending application entitled "Reduced Calorie Triglyceride Mixture", Serial No. 07/804,140, filed in the names of Wheeler, D'Amelia, Leveille, Otterburn, Klemann, Finley, Roden, Chrysam, Pelloso, and Given, Jr. on December 6, 1991, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to nuts and nut products, and particularly to an improved process for preparing reduced calorie nuts and nut products.The term "nuts" as used in this description includes whole nuts, splits, and pieces of nuts such as peanuts, cashews, almonds, Brazil nuts, filberts, pecans, walnuts, and the like. For purposes of conciseness in description, the following disclosure will center around the production of low-fat peanuts. It is not intended, however, to be limited to peanuts because the principles which will apply for peanuts should apply to other nuts.The basic procedures for preparing partially defatted nuts have been known for a number of years. For example, in U.S. 

Patent 2,003,415 to Ammann and U.S. Patent 3,294,549 to Vix et al., procedures for pressing the oil from nuts such as peanuts are described. Broadly, these methods include the steps of pressing nuts until the desired quantity of fully digestible triglyceride fats are removed and then steaming or cooking the partially defatted nuts in water until the nuts are reconstituted to substantially their original size and shape.Both the Am ann and Vix et al. patents discuss the virtues of partially defatted nuts in the diet. It is the decrease of triglyceride fat level in partially defatted nuts that give them a significantly lower calorie content than full fat nuts. Further work on the process of Vix et al. is described in a series of articles entitled, "Development and Potential of Partially Defatted Peanuts," Peanut Journal and Nut World, January and February 1967, and an article entitled, "Low Calorie Peanuts", Food Processing/Marketing, September, 1965.Later workers, encouraged by the apparent appeal of partially defatted nuts to weight-conscious consumers, continued to work in this area. U.S. Patent 3,645,752 to Baxley discloses a process which "improves" the flavor of partially defatted nuts by quenching them
