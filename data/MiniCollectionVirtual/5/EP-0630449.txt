<ABSTRACT>
A toothed belt construction formed mainly of thermoplastic material and method of making the same are provided, the method comprising the steps of disposing at least one layer of the thermoplastic material (21, 21A) about the outer peripheral surface (39) of a building drum (32, 32A) that has the outer peripheral surface (39) thereof defined by alternating teeth (38) and grooves (37), and then forcing the one layer of thermoplastic material (21, 21A) toward the drum (32, 32A) while the temperature of the one layer of thermoplastic material (21, 21A) is above its softening temperature and below its melting temperature so as to cause at least part of the one layer of thermoplastic material (21, 21A) to exude into the grooves (37) to form at least part of the plurality of teeth (24, 24A) of the belt construction (20, 20A).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a belt construction mainly of 
thermoplastic material and having opposed sides, one of which comprises a 
plurality of teeth and the other of which comprises an oppositely disposed 
generally flat surface means of said belt construction. The invention further 
relates to a belt construction formed mainly of thermoplastic material and 
having opposed sides, one of which comprises a plurality of teeth. It is known to provide a toothed belt construction formed mainly of 
thermoplastic material wherein the belt construction is made by injection 
molding the thermoplastic material after the thermoplastic material has been 
heated to a temperature above its melting temperature. It is also known to form a belt construction of an elastomeric material such as 
uncured rubber material by disposing at least one layer of the uncured rubber 
material about the outer peripheral surface of a building drum that has the 
outer peripheral surface thereof defined by alternating teeth and grooves, and 
then forcing the one layer of uncured rubber material toward the drum while 
the temperature of the one layer of uncured rubber material is above a certain 
softening temperature thereof and below a vulcanizing temperature thereof so 
as to cause at least part of the one layer of uncured rubber material to exude 
into the grooves to form at least part of the plurality of teeth of the belt 
construction. For example, see US-A 4,343,666, US-A 3,078,206 and US-A 
4,583,963. However, it is believed that it is not known that a toothed belt construction 
formed mainly of thermoplastic material can be formed by the method of the  
 
aforementioned US-patents 4,343,666 and 3,078,206. The reasons therefore 
are the distinctive material properties of thermoplastic material on one hand 
and elastomeric material on the other. This is evidenced by the fact that the 
teaching of US-A 4,343,666, which is believed to disclose the closest prior 
art, calls for curing of the elastomeric material after the teeth are formed. In 
particular, this prior art is quite clearly concerned with preventing premature 
curing from taking place, and therefore initially allows the elastomeric layer 
only to soften. Thereupon, additional heat is supplied to the vulcanizer to cure 
the elastomeric portions of the belt. It is one feature of this invention to provide a new method of making a 
toothed belt construction formed mainly of thermoplastic material without 
utilizing an injection molding process or a high

A method of making a belt construction (20, 20A) mainly of thermoplastic 
material (21, 21A) and having opposed sides (22, 23), one of which 

comprises a plurality of teeth (24, 24A) and the other of which comprises 
an oppositely disposed generally flat surface means of said belt 

construction, characterized by the steps of disposing one layer of said 
thermoplastic material (21, 21A) about the outer peripheral surface (39) 

of a building drum (32, 32A) that has said outer peripheral surface (39) 
thereof defined by alternating teeth (38) and grooves (37), and then 

forcing said one layer of thermoplastic material (21, 21A) toward said 
drum (32, 32A) while the temperature of said one layer of thermoplastic 

material (21, 21A) is above its softening temperature and below its 
melting temperature so as to cause part of said one layer of 

thermoplastic material (21, 21A) to exude into said grooves (37) to form 
at least the major portion of said plurality of teeth (24, 24A) and to 

cause another part of said one layer of thermoplastic material (21, 21A) 
to form at least the major portion of said oppositely disposed generally 

flat surface means of said belt construction (20, 20A), and thereupon 
allowing the thermoplastic material to cool. 
A method as set forth in claim 1, wherein reinforcing tensile means (28) 
are disposed between said opposed sides (22, 23), characterized by the 

steps of disposing said one layer of said thermoplastic material (21) 
about said reinforcing tensile means (28) that has been wound on said 

outer peripheral surface (39) of said building drum (32), and causing part 
of said one layer of thermoplastic material (21) to exude through said
