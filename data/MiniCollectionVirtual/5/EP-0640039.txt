 THIN FILM METALLIZATION AND BRAZING OF ALUMINUM NITRIDECROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending USSN 07/881,926 filedMay 12, 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to metallization for aluminum nitride ceramics having the properties of low thermal expansion and high thermal conductivity.More particularly, this invention relates to a metallization structure formed on an aluminum nitride substrate and a method of producing the metallization structure on the aluminum nitride substrate.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCeramic substrates are widely used as substrates for electronic circuits, and more recently as substrates for hybrid integrated circuits. In manufacturing a hybrid integrated circuit, it is necessary to mount an integrated circuit chip and other metal members such as bonding wires on the ceramic substrate by brazing or soldering. However, these members cannot be directly bonded to the ceramic substrate. It is therefore generally practiced to first form an electroconductive metallized layer on the ceramic substrate and then bond the metal members to the metallized layer.Because of its high thermal conductivity, excellent heat dissipation and electric insulating properties, aluminum nitride (AIN) substrates have been used as substrates for electronic packages such as hybrid integrated circuits. AIN is used in place of alumina (AI2O3) because of AlN's improved heat dissipation capabilities, and in place of beryllia (BeO) because unlike AIN, BeO is toxic and, thus difficult to handle.When an electronic substrate is used, the substrate is usually joined with a metal layer,- so that a conductive metallized structure is formed on the surface of the AIN substrate. Conventionally for AIN, this metallized structure has been a layer of Cu, AuSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

or Ag-Pd formed by the direct bond copper (DBC) method or by the thick film method. However, this method of metallizing AIN does not result in a well-adhered metallized layer, particularly when the package is subsequently processed at high temperatures. When a wire or semiconductor element is brazed onto the metallized layer at a high temperature, the adhesion strength between the metallized layer and the AIN substrate is greatly lowered and the metallized layer along with the wire or semiconductor element may eventually peel off of the AIN substrate. Because of the problems associated with the DBC method, metallization of AIN substrates has been attempted in a number of
