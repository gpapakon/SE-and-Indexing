<ABSTRACT>
In a CDMA cellular communication system, a forward CDMA channel is used to transmit information from a cell base to the mobile station. Conversely, a reverse CDMA channel is used to transmit information from the mobile station to the cell base station. The transmit portion of the mobile transceiver includes a microphone (12), a codec (16), a vocoder (14), a mask circuit (32), a convolutional encoder (22), a block interleaver (24), a 64-ary orthogonal modulator, an in-phase PN generator (38), a quadrature PN generator (40), filtering circuits (42, 44, 50, 52), a quadrature modulator (54) and a transmitter (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to the organization of data for transmission. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for formatting vocoder data, non-vocoder data and signaling
data for transmission.In the field of digital communications various arrangements of digital data for transmission are used. The data bits
are organized according to commonly used formats for transfer over the communication medium.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a data format which facilitates the communication of
various-types of data, and data of various rates, to be communicated in a structured form.US-A-4,291,409 discloses a method and apparatus employing spread spectrum techniques in a wide bandwidth
communications system. A plurality of transmitting stations are each equipped to provide a transmission signal representing
a pseudo-random coded, phase modulated, message signal. The transmission signal is directed through a
bandwidth which encompasses otherwise dedicated, relatively narrow bandwidth repeater channels, employed in connection
with a communications satellite, to a generally fixed receiver station. At the receiving station, the incoming
signal is (a) code acquired and tracked, (b) carrier acquired and tracked, (c) phase locked to the receiver local oscillator
and (d) coherently demodulated to extract the desired data. The receiving station advantageously employs plural receiving
elements each having a pseudo-random sequence code matched filter which significantly reduces code acquisition
time by obviating the necessity of exhaustively correlating the incoming signal with a replica of the pseudo-random
code word at the receiver station.EP-A2-0 412 583 discloses a time division multiple access (TDMA) communication device controller, which controls
all signaling, synchronization and supervisory functions. In one embodiment, the invention operates to control a remote
communication device having a vocoder and buffering means. The remote communication device is enabled to operate
as a dispatch, full duplex or a combination dispatch/full duplex communication device. In another embodiment, a primary
station (repeater) is controlled to operate as a single frequency repeater (SFR) or as a multi-frequency TDMA repeater.
A communication channel is divided into time sub-slots which may be allocated to different users. The number of sub-slots
allocated to a given user depends on the quality of speech required by the user. At the beginning of a
