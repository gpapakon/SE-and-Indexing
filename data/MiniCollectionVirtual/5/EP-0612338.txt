<DESCRIPTION>
 CARBON BLACKSHELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a class of new and novel furnace carbon blacks which are suitable for various applications and particularly well suited for use in plastic compositions.BACKGROUNDCarbon blacks are generally produced in a furnace-type reactor by pyrolyzing a hydrocarbon feedstock with hot combustion gases to produce combustion products containing paniculate carbon black.Carbon blacks may be utilized as pigments, fillers, reinforcing agents, and for a variety of other applications. Carbon blacks are widely utilized as fillers and reinforcing pigments in the compounding and preparation of rubber compositions and plastic compositions. Carbon blacks are generally characterized on the basis of their properties including, but not limited to, their surface areas, surface chemistry, aggregate sizes, and particle sizes. The properties of carbon blacks are analytically determined by tests known to the art, including iodine adsoφtion number (HNo.), nitrogen adsoφtion surface area (N2SA), dibutylphthalate adsoφtion (DBP), dibutyl phthalate adsoφtion of the crushed carbon black (CDBP), cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide absoφtion value (CTAB), Tint value (TINT), Dmode, Dst, ΔD50, and Number Median Dς/Dp.It is generally understood that the properties of a carbon black affect the properties of rubber or plastic compositions containing the carbon black. For example, the introduction of carbon black into a rubber or plastic composition during formation of the composition will generally affect the viscosity of the rubber or plastic composition. Lower viscosity rubber or plastic compositions are advantageous as they are more easily processed. Therefore, it is advantageous to have a carbon black that imparts a lower viscosity to rubber or plastic compositions during processing, without adversely affecting other properties of the rubber or plastic composition. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONWe have discovered new carbon blacks having an Iodine adsoφtion number (HNo.) of26-34 mg g (milligrams per gram carbon black); a CTAB (cetyl-trimethyl ammoniumbromide absoφtion value) of 26-34 m^/g (square meters per gram) ; a DBP (dibutyl phthalate value) of 61-69 cc lOOg (cubic centimeters of dibutyl phthalate per 100 grams carbon black) a Tint value ("Tint") of 46-54%; and aDst/Dmode ratio of 1.31-1.36. Preferably the carbon blacks are further characterized by having a Number Median (Oς/Op) of 2.7-3.1. NumberMedian (Dc/Dp) is defined as the carbon black aggregate circle diameter (D<-)
