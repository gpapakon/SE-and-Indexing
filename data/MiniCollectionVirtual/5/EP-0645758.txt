<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic disk apparatus suitable for use as a hard disk apparatus in a computer system. The apparatus 
includes a disk-like medium having a magnetic film formed on a surface, which information is recorded on or 

reproduced from; and magnetic heads (20 - 31) for recording on or reproducing from the information the disk-like 
medium. The disk-like medium has data recording regions (20 - 41D) and control signal recording regions (20 - 40), 

(20 - 41H). In the data recording regions, data tracks are raised and adjacent data tracks are separated by recessing 
guard bands (20 - 20). In the control signal recording region, on the other hand, tracking marks (20 - 12), (20 - 13) for 

tracking control of the magnetic heads, track number marks (20 - 71) for stipulating the tracks , track numbers (20 - 
41b1), (20 - 41b2) and clock marks (20 - 11) for equidistantly dividing a circumference are formed in projections and 

recesses along the paths (21 - 21) of the magnetic heads. In this apparatus, the guard band is recessed with respect 
to the track. Accordingly, the guard band needs not be expanded so as to reduce cross-talk, and a recording capacity 

can be increased by reducing the track pitch. Because the tracking mark and the track number mark or the clock mark 
are formed in projections and recesses along the paths of the magnetic heads, accurate access becomes possible even 

when the track pitch is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic disk
device suitable for use as a hard disk drive in a computer
system, for example.Computer systems employ hard disk devices and can
quickly access programs or data recorded in the hard disk devices.
In such a hard disk device, a magnetic film is formed
on each of the surfaces of a magnetic disk, and data are
recorded on and reproduced from the magnetic film by a flying-type
magnetic head. The hard disk device comprises a
mechanism for actuating the magnetic head and a drive unit
for driving the magnetic disk, the mechanism and the drive
unit being assembled in a casing. The hard disk device can
record data on the magnetic disk at a relatively high density.The magnetic film is formed on the entire surfaces
of the magnetic disk in the conventional magnetic disk device.
Therefore, it has been necessary to provide guard
bands of relatively large width between tracks in order to
suppress crosstalk from adjacent tracks. As a result, a
track pitch cannot be reduced, presenting an obstacle to efforts 
to realize a small-size device having a large recording
capacity.If an encoder clock signal is recorded in advance
on a magnetic disk and thereafter the magnetic disk is assembled
in a casing, then an attachment error (eccentricity)
tends to occur in the assembling process, making it difficult
to record and reproduced data in and from an exact position
on the magnetic disk. Heretofore, it has been customary to
assemble a magnetic disk in a casing, and thereafter record
an encoder signal on the magnetic disk. As a consequence, it
has been time-consuming and costly to complete the device.
From US-patent 5,138,511 a magnetic disk device is known,
where the level of the surface of the data tracks and the
servo tracks is higher than that of guard bands provided
between respective data tracks and servo tracks.The present invention has been made in view of the
above drawbacks, and provides a magnetic disk device which is
of a low cost and has a higher-density recording capacity,
and a method of manufacturing such a magnetic disk device. A magnetic disk device according to the invention has:
a disk-shaped medium with a magnetic film formed on a
surface for recording or reproducing information;a magnetic head for recording on and reproducing
information from said disk-shaped medium;an arm supporting said magnetic head to move said
magnetic head between the innermost and the outermost track of the
disk-shaped medium along a circular arc to a predetermined
radial position on said
