<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an apparatus for printing a 
passbook or the like in which platens are pressed against 

vertical stitch passbooks or the like which are different 
in width, along the back surface to perform printing. A 

sleeve shaft 37 is rotated by rotation of a motor 18, and 
eccentric sleeves 20 are rotated through springs 36 from 

the sleeve shaft 37 so as to press a left platen 9 and a 
right platen 10, thereby supporting left and right pages 

of an open passbook 1 or the like. Also, a plurality of 
divided platens 11 are provided surrounding a stitched 

portion of the passbook, so that printing can be performed 
in accordance with the position of the stitched portion 

which may be changed by a difference in width of passbooks 
or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for printing a vertical stitch passbook or the like 
including a stitched portion and, more particularly, to 
a printing apparatus of a passbook or the like which can 
print passbooks or the like which are different in 
width. An article to be printed by a conventional 
printing apparatus of a passbook or the like, (herein-after 
referred to as a passbook) is open laterally from 
its stitched portion. A conventional printing apparatus 
for the vertical stitched passbook has employed a so-called 
divided platen type in which left and right pages 
which are different in thickness are supported by the 
platens divided at the stitched portion to perform 
printing. In this type of printing apparatus, as 
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. 63-179771, a first platen for supporting 
the left pages, a second platen for supporting the right 
pages and a third platen for supporting the stitched 
portion of the passbook are supported by springs, the 
passbook is disposed on these platens and pressed to a 
paper guide, the platens are moved to upper and lower 
positions in accordance with the thickness of the left 
and right pages of the passbook by means of the springs  
 
such that the passbook is held between the platens and 
the paper guide, and printing of characters and the like 
is effected in a direction perpendicular to the stitched 
portion while keeping the gap between the printing 
surface and a printing head constant. In the above-described conventional printing 
apparatus, passbooks or the like which have a certain 
width and whose stitched portions are at a constant 
position can be supported by the left and right platens 
to be printed. However, if a passbook or the like 
having a different width is printed, a position of its 
stitched portion differs from the position of the platen 
for supporting a stitched portion at the fixed position 
because the passbook is feeded contacting its edge to a 
paper guide as a reference, which results in a problem 
that the passbook or the like cannot be normally 
supported for printing by the left and right platens. An object of the present invention is to solve 
the above-mentioned problem of the conventional technique 
by providing a printing apparatus of a passbook or 
the like which can print vertical stitch passbooks or 
the like having a different thickness in a direction of 
lines thereof even if the passbooks or the like are 
different in width. In order to achieve the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for printing a passbook or the like in 
which the back surface of the vertical stitch passbook 

(1) or the like including a stitched portion is supported 
by a plurality of platens (9, 10, 11) to perform 

printing,characterized in that 
said apparatus comprises a left platen (9) for supporting 

the back surface of left pages of the vertical 
stitch passbook or the like, a right platen (10) for 

supporting the back surface of right pages of the 
vertical stitch passbook or the like, a plurality of 

divided platens (11) which are located surrounding the 
central stitched portion between said left and right 

pages and which are individually vertically movable, a 
reference guide (8) on which the left and right pages 

are pressed by the left, right and divided platens (9, 
10, 11), and a platen driving mechanism which moves the 

platens (9, 10, 11) vertically to bring the pages of 
the open passbook (1) or the like into contact with 

said reference guide (8), said platen driving mechanism 
operates to bring the left and right platens (9, 10) 

into contact with the reference guide (8) through the 
passbook (1) or the like in accordance with the thickness 

of the left and right pages of the open passbook 
(1) or the like, and those of the plurality of divided 

platens (11) which correspond to the position of the 
stitched portion of the passbook or the like are moved 

vertically. 
An apparatus for printing a passbook or the like 
according to claim 1, wherein

 
said platen driving mechanism comprises a sleeve shaft 

(37) which is rotated by a motor (18), tension bushes 
(35) which are secured on said shaft (37) and rotated, 

a plurality of eccenctric sleeves (21, 22) which are 
pressed by cam springs (36) connected to said tension 

bushes (35), and rotated eccentrically with respect to 
said sleeve shaft (37), a plurality of first platen 

arms (13a, 13b, 13d, 13e) for supporting said left and 
right platens (9, 10) so that said plurality of eccentric 

sleeves (21, 22) abut against said left and right 
platens (9, 10), and a second platen arm (13c) for 

supporting the divided platens (11) which are raised by 
upward movement of at least one of said first platen 

arms (13a, 13b, 13d, 13e), rotation of said motor (14) 
causes the rotational force of said sleeve shaft (37) 

to be transmitted to said eccentric sleeves (21, 22) 
through the tension bushes (35) and the cam springs 

(36), eccentric rotations of said eccentric sleeves 
(21, 22) cause the left and right platens (9, 10) to be 

pressed in accordance with the thickness of the pages 
of the open passbook (1) or the like and to be brought 

into contact with said reference guide (8) through the 
passbook (1) or the like, and those of the plurality of 

divided platens (11) which correspond to the position 
of the stitched portion of the passbook (1) or the like 

are moved upwardly.
