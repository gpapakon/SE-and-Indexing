<ABSTRACT>
A pair of bi-fold lids (10) covers a container (1) having a depth 
dimension that is less than half the width dimension of the 

container. Each bi-fold lid has front and rear sections (11,12) that 
are hinged together along a hinge axis (14). The hinge axis is 

reinforced by adjacent flanges (31,42) that overlap one another when 
the lids are in their closed position. When the lids are 

open, the front and rear sections fold over on one another to 
reduce the extent to which they hang down adjacent the 

sidewall of the container. This permits a container of short 
height or shallow depth to have lids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bi-fold lids hinged to the 
sidewalls of a container that has a width dimension that 
exceeds twice its depth dimension. In particular each lid has 
two sections hinged to one another that extend across the 
opening of the container in a closed position and fold back 
onto each other when the lids are rotated to an open position. Conventional lidded containers have a depth dimension 
that exceeds the width dimension across the open top of the 
container. As a result, when the lids, which are hinged to 
the sidewalls of the container, are opened, the lids rotate 
approximately 270° to a position substantially parallel with 
the sidewalls. This permits the containers to be shipped in a 
nested stack with the lids open without a substantial change 
in the overall dimension of the container, as compared to when 
the lids are in the closed position. When a container is designed to have a width dimension 
between the sidewalls to which the lids are hinged that 
exceeds the depth of the container, the lids rotate to an open 
position, but are prevented from rotating the full 270° as a 
result of interference with the floor or other support surface 
supporting the container. As a result, when empty containers  
 
of such dimensions are stacked in a nested stack, the lids of 
the bottom container engage the support surface causing them 
to flare outwardly to a significant degree thus changing the 
overall dimension of the container, as compared with its 
dimension when the lids are closed. Thus lidded containers of 
shallow depth are not in wide circulation. It is an object of the invention to provide bi-fold lids 
hinged to the sidewalls of a container having a width 
dimension (between the sidewalls) that exceeds its depth 
dimension.  
 
A similar problem is addressed in GB-A-2 235 429 which discloses a pair 
of bi-fold lids according to the preamble of claim 1 and a container 
according to the preamble of claim 2. In this reference 
a container is proposed which overcomes the problem of interference 
between the lids of several empty nest stacked containers which 
causes the lids to become increasingly splayed with increasing 
height of the stack. In common with this known arrangement 
each bi-fold lid according to the present invention has two sections that 
are hinged 
together along a hinge joint extending parallel to the 
sidewalls. As a result, when the lids hinged to the sidewalls 
are opened by rotation about their hinge axis of approximately 
270°, the bi-fold lid sections

<CLAIMS>
A pair of bi-fold lids (10) for covering an open top (2) 
of a container (1), each of said bi-fold lids being 

hinged to a top of one of a sidewall (3, 4) and an 
endwall (5, 6) of the container and being joined across a 

mid-portion (8) of the open top (2) to form a joint when 
the lids are in a closed position, each said bi-fold lid 

(10) having front and rear sections (11, 12) hinged 
together along a hinge joint characterised by
 
each of said front and rear sections having flanges (31, 

41) extending outwardly beyond a hinge axis (13, 14) of 
said hinge joint and recessed flanges (32, 42) extending 

inwardly of the hinge axis (13, 14) and formed between 
said outwardly extending flanges (31, 41), wherein the 

outwardly extending flanges (31, 41) of one of said 
sections (12, 11) overlap corresponding positioned 

recessed flanges (42, 32) of the other said sections (12, 
11) to strengthen the hinge joint between said sections.  

 
A container having bi-fold lids (10), said container (1) 
haing opposed side (3, 4) and endwalls (5, 6) alternately 

joined together with a bottom wall (7) and having an open 
top (2), each of said bi-fold lids (10) being identical 

but in facing relation with a first edge of each said lid 
being hinged to a top portion of the sidewalls (3, 4) of 

the container and second edges of the lids extending 
parallel to said first edges and facing each other to 

form a joint therbetween when the lids are in a closed 
position, said bi-fold lids (10) having front and rear 

sections (11, 12) hinged together along a hinge axis (13, 
14), characterised by
 
each of said front and rear sections having flanges (31, 

41) extending outwardly beyond the hinge axis (13, 14) of 
said hinge joint and recessed flanges (32, 42) extending 

inwardly of the hinge axis (13, 14) and formed between 
said outwardly extending flanges (31, 41), wherein the 

outwardly extending flanges (31, 41) of one said sections 
(12, 11) overlap corresponding positioned recessed 

flanges (42, 32) of the other said sections (12, 11) to 
strengthen the hinge joint between said sections.  

 
A container according to claim 2, wherein each said 
lid (10) has a plurality of fingers (20) along said second edges and a 

plurality of pockets (21) formed between said fingers along said 
second edges, said fingers being received within said pockets 

to form said joint between said lids when said lids are in the 
closed position. 
A bi-fold lid according to claim 1, wherein said 
front and rear sections (11,12) of each of said lids (10) have 

interengaging structure (50,53) for maintaining the front and rear 
sections in folded relationship when said lid is in an open 

position.
