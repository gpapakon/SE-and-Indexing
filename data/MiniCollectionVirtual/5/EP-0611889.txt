<ABSTRACT>
A plate valve suitable primarily for compressors consists of a valve seat (1), of a catch (2) arranged at a distance from the latter and of plates arranged between them, specifically a closing plate (4) and at least one auxiliary plate (5). In order to simplify the fixing of the auxiliary plates (5) in the valve, the catch (2) projects with a catch hub (9) up against the valve seat (1) and at least one indentation (11) is provided in the catch hub (9). The auxiliary plates (5) are provided with holding arms (13) and have a cutout at their centre. They are placed onto the catch hub (9), whereupon the holding arms (13) can be engaged into indentations (11) at the catch hub (9) as a result of a relative movement between the catch (2) and auxiliary plate (5).

A plate valve, in particular for compressors, comprising a 
valve seat, a catcher arranged at a distance therefrom and 

plates arranged between the valve seat and the catcher, 
namely a closing plate controlling ports in the valve seat 

and at least one auxiliary plate, e.g. a spring plate, damper 
plate or guide plate, associated with the closing plate and 

fixed relative to the catcher, characterised in that a catcher 
hub (9) of the catcher (2) projects towards the valve seat (1) 

and is provided with at least one radial indentation (11), e.g. 
a groove, in that the auxiliary plate (5) is provided, in its 

centre, with an opening greater than the cross-section of the 
catcher hub (9) and has at least two retaining arms (13) 

projecting beyond its inner edge, and in that the retaining 
arms (13) are engageable in the indentation (11) of the 

catcher hub (9) by mounting the auxiliary plate (5), with its 
central opening, on the catcher hub (9) and by means of a 

relative movement between the catcher (2) and the 
auxiliary plate (5), e.g. by rotating or displacing the auxiliary 

plate (5) in the plane thereof. 
A plate valve according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
catcher hub (9) is formed with a non-circular cross-section 

and has recesses or flattened portions (12) of a circular form 
which extend in the axial direction and are adapted to the 

retaining arms (13) of the associated auxiliary plate (5), the 
said auxiliary plate (5) being mountable on the catcher hub 

(9) in the axial direction and being engageable in the 
indentations (11) of the catcher hub (9) by rotation. 
A plate valve according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
catcher hub (9) has indentations (11) at two diametrically  

 
opposed points and the opening, arranged in the centre of 

the auxiliary plate (5), fits eccentrically on the catcher hub 
(9), the retaining arms (13) being engageable in the 

indentations (11) of the catcher hub (9), after the auxiliary 
plate (5) has been mounted on the catcher hub (9), by 

displacement of the auxiliary plate (5) in the plane thereof. 
A plate valve according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the retaining arms (13) of the auxiliary plate (5) are 

convex at least in their region engaging in the indentations 
(11) of the catcher hub (9), preferably with a generatrix 

extending parallel to a radius of the catcher hub (9), and 
engage in the indentations (11) of the catcher hub (9) with 

resilient pretension. 
A plate valve according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that at least one axial bore (10) is provided 

in the catcher hub (9) and intersects at least one indentation 
(11) for receiving a retaining arm (13) of the auxiliary plate 

(5), a pin (8), which engages with the retaining arm (13) after 
the engagement of the retaining arms (13) in the associated 

indentation (11), being insertable into the said axial bore 
(10). 
A plate valve according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
pins (8) inserted into the axial bores (10) have, in the region 

of the indentations (11) of the catcher hub (9), indentations 
(17) which are aligned with the indentations (11) provided in 

the said catcher hub (9) and into which the retaining arms 
(13) are insertable, substantially semi-circular recesses (15), 

into which the pins (8) engage by being rotated by their 
ends directed away from the indentation (17), being 

provided in the retaining arms (13). 
A plate valve according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the pins (8) are located in blind holes (16) originating in 

the face of the valve seat (1), are protected against falling 
out by the said valve seat (1) and, for the purpose of being  

 
rotated at their ends, are provided with an engagement 

profile for a tool, e.g. with a transverse slot (18) for a 
screwdriver. 
A plate valve according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the pins (18) project from the blind holes (16) in the 

catcher (2) towards the valve seat (1) and engage in blind 
holes (16) provided in the valve seat (1).
