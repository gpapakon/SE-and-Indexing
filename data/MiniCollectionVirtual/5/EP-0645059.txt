<ABSTRACT>
In signal processing circuitry using active devices, non-linearity of the device causes distortion of pure tones and the generation of intermodulation products for more complex signals. The transfer characteristics of such active devices (10) may be considered as the accumulated characteristics of input and output filter stages (12, 16) separated by a non-linear region (14). To compensate for non-linearities and reduce intermodulation products, a drive circuit (18) comprises pre- and post-correction filters (26, 28) separated by a compensating amplifier (20). The frequency response of the pre-correction filter (26) corresponds to that of the input filter stage (12) but is reversed in the frequency spectrum; with conventional I.F. the transfer characteristic of the amplifier (20) and frequency response characteristic of the post-correction filter (28) are the respective complements of those of the non-linear region (14) and pre-correction filter (26). The circuitry may be extended to compensate for active devices having more than one non-linear region and has particular application to klystron amplifiers used in broadcast television transmitters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to signal processing circuitry using
an active device and in which inter-modulation products due to
non-linearity of the active device are reduced. The invention will
be described in the context of a klystron amplifier used in a
broadcast television transmitter, to which it is particularly
applicable, but the invention is not limited to such systems.A basic background description of such transmitters is to be
found in a paper by C.J. Edgcombe and C.N. O'Loughlin entitled "The
Television Performance of the Klystron Amplifier" published in The
Radio and Electronic Engineer, September 1971. That paper
describes in particular the 4-cavity klystron and the fact that it
has a non-linear behaviour. As the input power is increased from
zero towards the saturation value, with a single-frequency carrier
wave input, the ratio of output power to input power decreases. A
phase shift can also be introduced. This non-linearity is
compensated by pre-correction either at video (baseband) frequency
or more often at intermediate frequency (IF).Such non-linearity exists in general when the change in
level of the output signal is not exactly proportional to the change
in level of the input signal, i.e., the input/output transfer
characteristic is not precisely linear. All active devices are
non-linear to some extent. Their non-linear effects tend to worsen
with increases in output signal level and in conversion efficiency
i.e., AC power out/DC power in. The effect, in the region of
non-linearity of a periodic device that is incapable of harmonic
response, is to produce output distortion of a single pure input
tone which takes the form of amplitude change (normally a reduction)
of the pure output tone, as noted above. Additionally, 
intermodulation products are produced when the input consists of
more than one pure tone or is a complex signal. Finally variations
in amplitude or phase of one of the tones are inversely superimposed
on the others; this effect is termed cross-talk.Intermodulation products (IPs) are usually unwanted
distortion components of sum and difference terms of the various
signal frequencies of a multi-tone signal or a complex waveform that
is being processed by a non-linear device. These unwanted
components from a complex waveform, such as a television signal,
occur across a very broad band but are tailored by the response of a
periodic device when set up to the normal pass band such as for a TV
signal (normally from -1.25MHz to +5.5MHz relative to vision carrier
frequency).In-band
