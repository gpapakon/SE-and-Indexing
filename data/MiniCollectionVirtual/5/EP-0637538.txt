<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an energy-absorption beam (1) especially for vehicle longitudinal or transverse chassis members, characterised in that it has the overall shape of an I and includes two section elements (10, 20) interacting with each other to form two box beams (2, 3) joined together by a central web (4) and welded to one another at their lateral edges (11, 21; 12, 22) and at their parts (13, 23) forming the central web (4) and in that it includes means for organising and controlling the deformation of the said beam (1) when stressed mechanically.

Energy absorption beam, particularly for longitudinal or transverse members 
of vehicles, which has in section the general shape of an I and two profiled 

elements (10, 20) cooperating with one another for forming two compartments 
(23) interconnected by a central web (4) and welded to one another 

at their lateral edges (11, 21; 12, 22) and their portions (13, 23) forming 
the central web (4), characterized in that it has means (14, 15, 24, 25, 30, 

31, 32, 33) for organizing and controlling the deformation of said beam (1) 
during a mechanical, axial compression stress formed by 
projections (14, 24) 
and hollows (15, 25) formed on each portion (13, 23) of the profiled elements 

(10, 20) forming the central web (4) and facing one another in order to produce 
on said web (4) a longitudinal succession of contact portions (5) and 

cavities (6), said contact portions (5) being welded together. 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that the hollows (15, 25) are 
produced by stamping and have an ovoid shape in the transverse direction of 

said beam (1). 
Beam according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the hollows (15, 
25) are extended on the portions of the profiled elements (10, 20) adjacent to 

the portions (13, 24) forming the central web (4). 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that the projections (14, 24) 
located between the hollows (15, 25) are formed by curved surface portions. 
Beam according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
projections (14, 24) and the hollows (15, 25) determine a succession of continuous, 

non-developable corrugations. 
Beam according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
spacing between two successive hollows (respectively 15, 25) is determined as 

a function of the desired organization of the deformation of said beam (1) 
during a mechanical, axial compression stress. 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that the means for the  
 

organization and control of the deformation of the beam (1) are formed by a 
planar metal sheet (30) interposed between two profiled elements (10, 20) 

traversing each compartment (2, 3) and welded to said ends (10, 20) at their 
lateral edges (11, 21; 12, 22) and their portions (13, 23) forming the 

central web (4), said planar sheet (30) being perforated, at each compartment 
(2, 3), with at least one row (31, 32) of orifices (33) and the orifices (33) 

of each row (31) in the first compartment (2) are symmetrical to the orifices 
(33) of each row (32) in the second compartment (3) with respect to the 

central web (4). 
Beam according to claim 7, characterized in that the spacing between two 
adjacent orifices (33) of each row (31, 32) is determined as a function of the 

desired organization of the deformation of said beam during a mechanical, 
axial compression stress. 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that each compartment (2, 3) 
has an asymmetrical section with respect to the dimensions of the walls of 

said compartment (2, 3). 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that each compartment (2, 3) 
has an asymmetrical section with respect to the angle formed by two adjacent 

walls of said compartment (2, 3). 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that each compartment (2, 3) 
has an asymmetrical section with respect to the radius of curvature linking 

two adjacent walls of said compartment (2, 3). 
Beam according to claim 1, characterized in that each compartment (2, 3) 
has an asymmetrical section with respect to the dimensions of the walls of 

said compartment (2, 3), the angle formed by two adjacent walls and the radius 
of curvature linking two adjacent walls. 
Beam according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
walls of the compartments (2, 3) have continuous, non-developable corrugations 

in the longitudinal direction of said beam (1).
