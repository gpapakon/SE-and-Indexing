<ABSTRACT>
A cement composition admixture comprising a borohydride, and a cement composition comprising cement, the above admixture, 
aggregate and water. The borohydride facilitates the control of the expansion ratio because it has an expansion effect 

which is scarcely affected by temperature, and can provide a hardened body having a good resistance to freezing and thawing because 
it forms only minute bubbles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new admixture for cement 
compositions 
with 
improved durability to freezing and thawing, and relates to 
cement compositions using the admixture. An expansion agent is added to cement compositions such 
as a cement milk, mortar and concrete to provide lightening 
property, adiabatic property, low contraction property and the 
like. Further, an expansion agent is added to, e.g., concrete 
for being placed in a constraint space where a construction 
joint cannot integrate with old concrete like a back placing 
concrete working method to compensate volume decrease. Conventionally, alminium powder is generally used as such 
an expansion agent in view of influence on concrete properties 
and circumstance, and economy. This expansion agent made of 
alminium powder is chemically reacted with alkali components 
in a cement mixture to generate hydrogen gas. The hydrogen 
gas acts so as to expand surrounding cement mixture. However, for alminium powder, the expansion amount is 
significantly influenced by temperature. Even if an additive 
amount of alminium powder is the same, the expansion amount 
increases with higher temperature and the expansion amount  
 
decreases with lower temperature. Thus, control of expansion 
amounts is difficult. Further, concrete using alminium powder 
as an expansion agent has poor resistance to freezing and 
thawing. Since alminium powder is liable to be oxidized in 
the air, care should be taken to handling and storage thereof. Alkali metal borohydrates have also been used as expansion agents. 
Such compositions are for example disclosed in SU-A-2 323 654 and 
SU-A-1 654 542. The object of the invention is to provide an admixture for 
cement compositions for imparting 
improved resistance to freezing and thawing, and to 
provide an admixture for cement compositions with stability in 
the air; and to provide cement compositions with the 
admixture. The invention is the use of an admixture for cement compositions 
containing tetrahydroborate and cement 
for improving the freezing and thawing durability of cement compositions. Illustrative tetrahydroborate used for the invention are 
sodium borohydride (NaBH4), lithium borohydride (LiBH4), 
calcium borohydride (Ca(BH4)2) and ammonium borohydride 
(NH4BH4). Of them, sodium borohydride is preferably used in 
view of the handling property. Sodium borohydride is a complex metal hydride in a white 
powder form with molecular weight of 37.86. For the thermal 
stability thereof, it is stable in dry air up to
