<ABSTRACT>
A label sticking apparatus has a suction drum (40) with at 
least three holding-sticking units (41) mounted at constant 

intervals on the periphery thereof so as to be movable in 
radial directions of the suction drum. The suction drum (40) is 

rotated intermittently by a constant amount so as to feed and 
stop the holding-sticking units (41) at a label feeding station (51), a 

positioning station (52) and a sticking station (56) which are disposed 
around the suction drum in this sequence. Labels are seriatim 

peeled from a label tape (16) and held on a distal end of the 
holding-sticking unit (41) at the label feeding station (51). At the 

positioning station (52), positioning of each label is performed by 
a positioning head (52) having a centering pin (70) and a pair of angular 

position correction pins (71,72). At the sticking station (56), the 
holding-sticking unit (41) is pushed through an eccentric cam (45) 

radially outward from the suction drum toward a work-piece (25), to 

press and stick the label held on the holding-sticking unit 
onto the work-piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a label sticking 
apparatus of the type as described in the preamble of claim 1, 
and a label tape suitable for that label 
sticking apparatus. In order to stick labels on work-pieces including 
articles and parts, various kinds of label sticking apparatus 
have been known wherein labels are automatically peeled from a 
label tape by means of a peeling edge, held by pads or drum 
through vacuum adsorption, and stuck on the work-pieces by 
means of the pads or the drum.  
 A label-sticking apparatus as defined above is described in 
EP 0 218 925 and the associated EP 0 006 505. The known label-sticking 
apparatus is used to stick labels onto two opposite 
sides of a tape cassette. The tape cassettes are fed in between 
two rotating sticking heads which are provided with a plurality 
of holding-sticking units for the labels. The holding-sticking 
units of the rotating heads pass step by step three stations 
circumferentially arranged around the rotating head. In the 
first station the labels are attached to holding-sticking units. 
In the second station the labels are centred with respect to the 
holding-sticking units, and in a third station the labels are 
attached to the tape cassette. According to EP 0 006 505 the 
holding-sticking units have suction means for holding the labels 
and can be moved radially with respect to the rotation head for 
pressing the labels onto the tape cassette. The pressing 
operation is performed by a single means and by a predetermined 
pressure, irrespective of whether there are some variations in 
dimensions of the work piece and/or the holding-sticking units.  
 JP-B-63-62422 
discloses a label sticking 
apparatus which peels labels from a label tape by means of a  
 
peeling edge, and adsorptively holds labels on the periphery of 
a rotary suction drum, and wherein a feed line for feeding 
work-pieces to be labeled is disposed near the suction drum and 
driven in synchronism with the rotation of the suction drum so 
that the labels are successively stuck on the work-pieces which 
are passed near by the suction drum. There are also such label sticking apparatus that 
have a label position adjusting or correcting device. In a 
known label sticking apparatus as shown in Fig.11, a label 2a 
is peeled from a label tape 2 at a peeling edge 3, and attached 
to a holding-sticking unit 4 by vacuum suction. Thereafter, the 
orientation or position of the label 2a is corrected by pushing 
the label 2a with pushing members 5a and 5b in X- and
