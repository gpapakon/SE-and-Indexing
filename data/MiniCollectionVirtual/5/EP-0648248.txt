<ABSTRACT>
A novel aqueous sheet-impregnating composition including a composition of a styrene-ethyl acrylate-butyl acrylate copolymer and a binder. The binder is selected from polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, gelatin and starch, and the composition includes 5-90 parts by weight of a polyvinyl alcohol solution and 10-95 parts by weight of a styrene-ethyl acrylate-butyl acrylate copolymer dispersion. A decorative sheet for laminates may thereby be obtained.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an aqueous impregnating composition for
the manufacture of an impregnated decorative paper

sheet intended to be applied on a base support by means
of an adhesive in order to form a decorative panel,

characterized in that the said impregnating composition
is substantially devoid of formaldehyde and comprises a

composition comprising a styrene-ethyl acrylate-butyl
acrylate copolymer and comprising a binder chosen from

poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl acetate), gelatin and
starch.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the impregnating composition comprises:


from 5 to 90 parts by weight of a poly(vinyl
alcohol) solution
from 10 to 95 parts by weight of a dispersion
of a styrene-ethyl acrylate-butyl acrylate copolymer.
Use according to either of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the poly(vinyl alcohol)

solution is a solution containing 5 to 15% of
poly(vinyl alcohol).
Use according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the pH of the impregnating

composition is between 5.0 and 7.0.
Use according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the viscosity of the composition

is between 44.1 and 58.8 mPaÂ·s.
Use according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the composition comprises: 


50 parts by weight of a from 5 to 15%
poly(vinyl alcohol) solution
50 parts by weight of a dispersion of a
styrene-ethyl acrylate-butyl acrylate copolymer.
Impregnated decorative paper sheet intended to
be applied to a panel by means of an adhesive,

characterized in that it is impregnated with an
impregnating composition as defined in one of Claims 1

to 6.
Process for the manufacture of a decorative
paper sheet intended to be applied to a base support by

means of an adhesive in order to form a decorative
panel, characterized in that the said sheet is

impregnated with an aqueous impregnating composition as
defined in one of Claims 1 to 6.
