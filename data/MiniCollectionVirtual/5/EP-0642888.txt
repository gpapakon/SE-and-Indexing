<ABSTRACT>
A cubicle (3) which serves to accommodate a sand blaster (51) and an operator (5) is fixed to a lifting device (2). It has a working opening (32), the edge of which is surrounded on all sides by an inflatable seal (33). Radial fans (36) extract the dust-laden air from the cubicle (3) and blow it through dust-laden air conduits (371, 372) alternately into one of two respective washing chambers (381, 382). The washing chambers (381, 382) can be individually emptied and refilled when there is no dust-laden air being supplied to them. As a result, excellent dust removal is possible with a simple device and with little weight being placed on the lifting device (2). In order to prevent dust from escaping at the seal, a dust conveyor (41), preferably a shaker conveyor, which can be placed against the facade (6) above the lower seal part (330) is proposed. This dust conveyor catches the dust above the seal (330) and conveys it for extraction.

<CLAIMS>
Sandblasting device (1) for dry sandblasting of large parts, e.g. structures or
facings, with a booth (3) to receive a sandblaster (51) with its operators (5),

the booth (3) having a working opening (32), the edge of which is surrounded
on all sides by a seal (33), which can be placed against the part (6) to be

sandblasted, and at least one exhausting device (36) for removal of dust-laden
air from the booth (3), 
characterised

by a dust conveyor (41) arranged above the lower section (330) of the seal
(33), which can be placed against the part (6) to be sandblasted in the working

position, and collects a large proportion of the dust falling in the area of this
lower seal section (330) and conveys it to an area from which it is removed

from the booth (3) with the exhausted dust-laden air. 
Sandblasting device according to claim 1, characterised in that the dust
conveyor forms an inclined sliding plane, which covers the lower seal section

(330) of the seal (33) and can be placed with a longitudinal edge against the part
(6).
Sandblasting device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the dust
conveyor (41) is connected functionally to a vibrator.
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
dust conveyor (41) is pivoted on the booth (3) in such a way that it can be swung

down about an axis "O" into its working position and can be raised from its
working position.
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
dust conveyor (41) has a longitudinal edge, which corresponds essentially to the

width of the working opening (32), and is provided with a deformable sealing
element, whereby the latter can be pressed against the part (6) to be

sandblasted above the lower seal section (330) in the working position.
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
dust conveyor (41) is arranged in such a way that it conveys the collected dust

into a collecting chamber (34) within the booth (3), which is connected to the
exhausting device (36) for removal of dust-laden air from the booth (3) in such a

way that the dust of the dust conveyor (41) is mixed with the dust-laden air
removed from the booth (3). 
Sandblasting device according to claim 6, characterised in that the collecting
chamber (34) is bounded at the top from the booth (3) by a grating (31), which is

designed as the standing area for the operator (5).
Sandblasting device according to claim 7, characterised in that the collecting
chamber (34) is connected to the exhausting device (36) for removal of dust-laden

air from the booth (3) in such a way that the exhausted dust-laden air
passes through it, the dust-laden air exhausted from the booth (3) flowing via the

grating (31) into the collecting chamber (34), and a mixing device (35) for mixing
dust from the dust conveyor (41) into the exhausted dust-laden air is provided in

the collecting chamber (34).
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised by at least
two washing chambers (381,382), each of which can be filled with a washing

liquid to a level (39) and emptied, into which a dust-laden air line (37,371,372),
terminates, which can admit alternatively dust-laden air and extends under the

liquid level (39), control means being provided to empty the washing chambers
(381,382) separated from the dust-laden air supply and fill it again with washing

liquid to the liquid level (39).
Sandblasting device according to claim 9, characterised in that a separate
exhausting device (40) is assigned to the washing chambers (381,382) in such a

way that it removes the cleaned air above the liquid level (39).
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the
exhausting device (36) for removal of dust-laden air from the booth (3) has a 

radially conveying blower (36), the pressure side of which is connected to a dust-laden
air line (37,371,372), which terminates in a wet separator.
Sandblasting device according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the
seal (33), which surrounds the working opening (32), comprises an inflatable

seal.
