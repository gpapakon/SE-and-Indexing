<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and
apparatus for grinding material particles such as cement
clinker, slag or ore, and a a grinding apparatus provided
with a classifying device for performing classification
of the material particles.In a prior art technique, when it is required to
manufacture cement powders as product by grinding burned
cement clinkers, a tube mill has been utilized as a
grinding means. The tube mill comprises a tubular
(cylindrical) rotary container in which a number of steel
balls are accommodated, and the material particles to be
ground are subjected to the grinding operation in the
container by rotating the same.In such grinding operation, when the materials
including coarse particles, each having relatively large
diameter, are to be ground, it is necessary to utilize
balls each having a large diameter. However, when the
balls having large diameter are utilized, contacting
areas between the balls and the material particles are
reduced, thus the grinding efficiency being reduced.
Accordingly, in recent years, a roller mill is often used
for precedingly grinding the material particles including
coarse particles in combination with the tube mill.The roller mill, for example, a vertical roller
mill, has a structure in which peripheral surfaces of a
plurality of rollers are pressed against an upper surface
of a table rotating in a horizontal plane and the
material particles supplied on the table are ground by
being pressed by the rollers. As described, since the
coarse materials can be effectively ground by applying
sufficient pressing force to the rollers, the roller mill
is effective for the coarse grinding operation for the
succeeding operation for the tube mill. When the
material particles can be thus ground to fine particles 
by means of roller mill, the tube mill can improve the
grinding efficiency with using the smaller size of steel
balls.Figs. 3 and 4 shows examples of conventional
grinding apparatus constructed in combination of a roller
mill and a tube mill.Fig. 3 shows an arrangement of the grinding
apparatus disclosed in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication (KOKAI) No. SHO 63-116751 (116751/1988), in
which a vibrating screen device 1 having screens 1a as a
classifier is arranged in a material conveying path 20
extending from a vertical roller mill 10 installing
roller 12 therein to a tube mill 40, and a fine powder
component classified by the vibration screening device 1
is fed to the tube mill 40 through the material conveying
path 20 and a coarse particle
