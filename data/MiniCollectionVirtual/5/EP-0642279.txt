<ABSTRACT>
A security node disposed in the telecommunications network connecting
calling and called parties transforms information (which can be voice, data,

facsimile, video and other types of calls or messages) encrypted in a first format to
(a) encrypted information in a different format or to (b) non-encrypted information,

and vice-versa. The node is accessible from any location connected to the network.
By routing calls or messages originated by the calling party and destined for the

called party via the security node, and providing appropriate control signals to the
node, the information may be encrypted only over a portion of the transmission path

between the parties, and clear over the remainder of the transmission path.
Alternatively, the information may be encrypted in different portions of the path

using different encryption algorithms. This arrangement enables the parties to obtain
relatively secure communications even if only one party has a security device at the

originating or terminating end, or if the parties have security devices using different
handshaking protocols and encryption algorithms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to secure telecommunications involving 
voice, data, facsimile, video and other information. Over the past several years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on 
increasing the security of telecommunications systems, so that unauthorized persons 
cannot intercept and access voice, data, facsimile, video or other information not 
intended for them. Studies have shown that the commercial markets are well aware 
of the threats to their communications systems and have a clear sense of the business 
applications which are at risk because of potential breakdowns in security. The 
reasons for the heightened interest are many, including the increased use of cellular 
telephony in which a portion of the conversation is carried over the air and is thus 
more susceptible to attack, and the fact that other portions of the telecommunications 
network can be particularly susceptible to security breaches; i.e., wiring closets, 
junction boxes, manhole or telephone pole connections, facsimile machines, and 
especially cordless and cellular phones. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, 
secure communications between calling and called parties is accomplished with use 
of a secure telephone device (STD). An STD disposed between the handset and the 
base of each party's telephone converts a conventional non-secure telephone call to a 
secure call by encrypting speech to be transmitted to a party and by decrypting 
speech received from that party. Illustratively, each party's STD comprises a speech 
coder (and decoder) (codec), a cryptographic system, and a modem. Both the 
modem and the speech codec are suitably interfaced to the telephone base and 
handset of the party, respectively. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, a secure telephone call 
between two parties having STDs is predicated on an existing non-secure call over a 
telephone network. Given an STD in combination with a telephone, a calling party 
establishes a non-secure telephone call in conventional fashion (for example, by  
 
generating DTMF signals with the keypad of the telephone base to identify the called 
party). At the outset of such a call, the STD of each party is in non-secure mode and 
therefore acts only as a conduit for speech signals to and from a telephone handset. 
Either party to the non-secure call may initiate a conversion of the call to a secure 
call by signalling for the initiation of training and cryptographic key exchange 
sequences between the
