<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the treatment of shock and for inhibition 
of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in a mammal by use of certain 
pyrimidones and imidazolinones. The pyrimidones and imidazolinones of use in the present invention are 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,128,358, which is incorporated by reference, for use as 
antidepressants. WO 91/07178 discloses the use of these compounds in the treatment 
of asthma, and inflammatory and skin diseases. The use of these compounds in the 
treatment of shock and inhibition of TNFα is not disclosed in these references. According to the invention, production of TNFα is inhibited by administering to 
a subject in need of such inhibition a compound of the formula 
   or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of said compound having 
a basic nitrogen atom,
 
wherein
 
   X is O or NH;
 
   m is 0, 1 or 2;
 
   n is 0, 1 or 2;
 
   m and n is 1 or 2;
 
   R₁ is C₇-C₁₁ tricycloalkyl or C₇-C₁₁ bicycloalkyl;
 
   R₂ is methyl or ethyl;
 
 
   R₂ is methyl or ethyl;
 
   R₃ is hydrogen, C₁-C₃ alkyl, C₂-C₃ alkenyl, benzyl or phenethyl; and
 
   R₄ is hydrogen, C₁-C₃ alkyl or C₂-C₃ alkanoyl; with the proviso that when m + 
n is 1 then m is 0 and n is 1, and with the proviso that when m + n is 2 then R₃ and 
R₄ are each hydrogen, in an amount sufficient for said treatment. In a preferred method, the compound used is 5-(3-[(2S)-exobicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yloxy]4-metholxyphenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one. In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula I as 
defined above is used in the treatment of shock. The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition 
salts thereof (the active compounds) and their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
5,128,358. As disclosed in the patent, stereocenters exist in several of the 
polycycloalkyl groups R₁ and the pyrimidinone or imidazolidinone groups. The racemic-diastereomeric 
structures and the individual optical isomers are also included in the 
compounds of formula I of use in the method of the invention. The active compounds inhibit production of TNFα and are therefore of use in the 
treatment of diseases associated with excessive or unregulated TNFα production such 
as septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV infection, insulin 
resistance in type 2 diabetes, inflammatory diseases, adult respiratory distress 
syndrome, post-renal dialysis syndrome, and graft versus host disease after bone 
marrow
