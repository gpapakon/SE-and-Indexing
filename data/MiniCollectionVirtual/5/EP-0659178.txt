<DESCRIPTION>
 CHIRAL QUINOLONE INTERMEDIATESTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to chiral synthetic intermediates and the means of their preparation. More particularly, the invention relates to chiral amino-protected 4-amino-2-methylpyrrolidinines as well as compounds and procedures useful in the preparation thereof.Background of the InventionThe compounds of formula II, below, are useful intermediates in the preparation of certain quinolone antibacterial agents. For example, BOC- or acetyl-protected (2S,4S)-4-amino-2-methylpyrrolidine (II, in which R2 is -BOC or acetyl) are intermediates in the synthesis of 7-((2S,4S)-4-am ino-2-methyl- 1 -pyrrolidi nyl)- 1 -(2(4-difluorophenyl)- 1 ,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, the preparation of which is described in United States Pat. No. 4,962,112.Chira, 5-6 stepsAmine0 (l«)Reported syntheses of compounds II are limited in their ability to provide stereochemically pure products with a minimum of reaction steps, and in the availability of the necessary starting materials. Thus there is a continuing need to develop more effective syntheses of II. The compounds and process of the present invention enable the production of compound II from starting materials which are readily available and/or with yields which were previously unattainable.Summary of the InventionThe compounds of the present invention are chiral intermediates having the formulae 
(V I M)In the above formulae, Ph is phenyl;R is selected from the group consisting of f-BOC and acetyl;R5 is hydrogen or loweralkyl;R6 is selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, halo and cyano;R7 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl;R8 is selected from the group consisting of -CH2C6H5 and-CH(CH3)C6H5; andR9 is selected from the group consisting of -CH2C6H5 and-CH(CH3)C6H5.Preferred among the compounds of the invention are those of formulae VI and VIII wherein the chiral carbon atom at C-4 has either the R- or the S-configuration.The process of the present invention comprises a means of preparing a frans-configuration amino-protected 4-amino- 2-methylpyrrolidine compound having the formulaNH 'R1JX 

 According to the process, a corresponding -τa/7s-configu ration N-1 -protected intermediate of the formulais selectively crystallized from a (ΛR)- and (4S)-configuration mixture of said intermediate, in which R1 is t-BOC or acetyl, and R1 0 is hydrogen or methyl.Detailed Description of the InventionIn the specification and claims hereof, the following terms have been accorded the
