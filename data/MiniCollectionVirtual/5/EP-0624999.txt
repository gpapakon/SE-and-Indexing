<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic wok, 
more particularly, to an electromagnetic wok which is a cooker 
with a cyclic watercooling system applied in big restaurants, 
camps or factories. The activating power for the instant 
invention is under 30 KW. FIG. 1 shows the magnetic figure of prior art. Accordingly, 
conventional electromagnetic wok has a plurality of circular 
induction coil 2, on which a insulation layer 1 is disposed as 
shown in FIG. 1. A wok body 1A is disposed on the insulation 
layer 1. The circular induction coil 2 generate magnetic 
figure 2B to heat the wok body 1A. However, the induction 
coils 2 of conventional electromagnetic wok is adapted the 
manner of air cooling. Thus, the longer conventional 
electromagnetic wok is used, the higher the temperature raises. 
And this causes the resistant value to raise and leads to the 
energy loss. Hereunder are examples and calculations taken 
from a regular conventional electromagnetic wok of 1000 watts. 
1. The heating efficiency of the best performance is 90%, 
and the best performance results from no superfluous objects 
disposed between the wok body 1A and the insulation layer 1. 
In addition, the thickness of the insulation layer 1 is at most 
2 mm (millimeters).  2. The magnetic conductivity of the wok metal must be good. 
If the metal of the wok body is made of galvanized iron, the 
heating efficiency of the performance is approximately 80%. 3. The thickness of the wok bottom should be at least 4 mm. 
If so, the heating efficiency will be kept. If the thickness 
of the wok bottom is under 1 mm, the heating efficiency of the 
performance will be reduced under 80%. To average the above-mentioned factors, the heating 
efficiency of the performance is approximately 80%. In the 
20% loss, the induction coil shares 95% of the loss. In 
other words, the induction coil is resposible for 19% total 
power loss. Calculations are described as follows. The induction coefficient of the iron wok is 0.3. We have 
power of the induction p = 1000 w × 0.9 (real induction 
power) = 900 w (watts). Therefore, the virtual induction power of the induction coil 
equals to p ÷ 0.3 = 3000 VA (volt-ampere). If the induction coil has 100 V current, then
 
   3000 VA ÷ 100 V = 30 A. The inductive reactance of the induction coil is 
   and the loss is 
w = I² × R = 99 w  
,
 
   99 w ÷ 1000 w = 9.9%,
 
   therefore the efficiency is 90.1%. When the wok is made of galvanized iron, the induction 
coefficient is 0.1333. The real induction power
