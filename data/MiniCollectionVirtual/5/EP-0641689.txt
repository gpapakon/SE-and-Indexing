<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided for ignition of a pyrotechnic or 
hybrid inflator (16) for use in motor vehicles by the input 

of energy provided by a laser source. The laser energy is 
conducted through an optical fibre (18) and an optical 

window (28) in the inflator housing (16) where the ignition 
of a propellant initiator (14) is triggered. This 

apparatus eliminates the potential for ignition of the 
inflator by radio frequency energy or static electricity 

acting on the electrical squib which- is standardly used to 
ignite an inflator. This design further simplifies the 

igniter assembly for use in an inflator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas generators for inflating 
vehicle inflatable restraint cushions, commonly known as an air bag 
restraint systems, so as to provide impact protection to occupants 
of the vehicles. More particularly, this invention relates to an 
improved apparatus for the ignition of gas generating material 
within the inflator. The part of an air bag restraint system for use in the 
passenger compartment of a vehicle, referred to as an air bag 
module, typically includes a canister, which encloses a gas 
generator, or as it is commonly known an inflator, and at least 
part of an air bag, and a cover which conceals the air bag module 
from view. When the vehicle is involved in a collision, a crash 
signal initiates operation of the inflator to cause the air bag to 
deploy. The inflator produces an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) which 
is directed under pressure into the air bag to force the air bag 
out of the canister incorporated in the module and into the 
passenger compartment of the vehicle. In a pyrotechnic type, 
inflator gas is produced by the burning of a gas generating 
material. As the air bag is forced out of the container, pressure 
exerted on the cover causes selected portions of the cover to 
separate in a predetermined manner along tear seams to enable the 
air bag to be directed into the passenger compartment. As the air 
bag is directed into the passenger compartment, it is inflated by 
the continued flow of gas produced by the inflator.  The gas generator for a passenger vehicle includes a disk-shaped 
or a cylindrical housing having openings therein for release 
of gas. A gas generating material is deployed in the interior of 
the housing in pellet or wafer form. A cooling and filtering 
structure surrounds the combustible gas generating material charge 
in order to filter out hot or burning particles and cool the gas 
produced by the gas generating material. Ignition of the gas 
generating material is achieved by an igniter tube extending 
through the gas generating material along the axis of the charge 
and the housing. The tube typically contains a rapid detonation or 
deflagration cord, or fuse, and igniter powder. An electric 
initiator and charge, or squib, is mounted to the housing and 
lights the rapid deflagration cord. The rapid deflagration cord in 
turn sets off the igniter powder, which bursts the igniter tube and 
lights the gas generating material. Typically, the energizing terminals of electric squibs are 
connected by parallel rod conductors to the
