<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic recording tape comprising a biaxially
oriented, unidirectionally long polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
film
as the substrate, the tape being useful for
high-density recording, capable of recording
for a long period of time and excellent in electro-magnetic
conversion characteristics. The invention is particularly a
magnetic recording medium having a thin magnetic metal
film formed by vapor deposition such as a magnetic
recording tape for use with VTR.As a magnetic recording film which has high
coercive force for magnetic recording and is capable of
recording for a long period of time, there has been
proposed a magnetic recording tape which is obtained by
preparing, as a substrate, a biaxially oriented
polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate film having
specific mechanical properties and a specific surface
structure, forming a magnetic layer of a thin metal
film on one surface of the substrate and forming a
coating of an organic polymer containing a lubricant on
the other surface of the substrate where no thin
magnetic metal film is formed. This magnetic recording
film has an improved coercive force for magnetic
recording due to the use of a polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
film having a stress of at
least 18 kg/mm2 when elongated in the longitudinal
direction by 5 %, a Young's modulus of at least 800
kg/mm2 in the longitudinal direction and a Young's
modulus of at least 500 kg/ mm2 in the transverse
direction. However, the above film still involves problems in that the substrate film undergoes
curling when a thin metal film is formed thereon by vapor deposition, and has trouble in
running during the formation of the magnetic recording tape, and the formed tape either fails to
give an adequate output or runs unstably because of the curling and fails to be in good contact
with a magnetic head when used encased in a cassette.It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic recording tape comprising
a biaxially oriented, unidirectionally long polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate film
which is almost free of curling when a thin metal film is formed thereon by vapor deposition,
which has a high coercive force, being substantially free from data dropout and having
excellent running properties and durability even at a small thickness.The above objects and advantages of the present invention are achieved by a magnetic
recording tape comprising a biaxially oriented, unidirectionally long polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate 
film
