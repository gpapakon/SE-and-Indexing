<ABSTRACT>
An animal harboring a non-native germ cell, its corresponding line, and the corresponding germ cells, are obtained by colonizing the testis (or testes) of a host animal with primitive cells followed by raising and/or breeding the host.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REPOPULATION OF TESTICULAR SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES WITH FOREIGN CELLSThe research in which the technology described in this document is based, was supported by U.S. government (NIH) funding.Field Of The Invention:The present invention relates to animals harboring a non- native germ cell, to corresponding animal lines and germ cells, and to methods for obtaining the same.Discussion Of The Background;There have been many attempts to influence differentiation of developing cells by modifying the genotype of an embryo and then observing its effect on the phenotypic development pattern in the progeny. These techniques included nuclear transfer (McGrath & Solter, Science (1983) 220:1300- 1302) and cell-egg fusions (Graham, "Heterospecific Genome Interaction," 1969 Wistar Institute Press, pp. 19-35, ed. Defendi) . Of the two, the former has had limited success.Another approach might be to add a stem cell(s) to an early embryo and determine its effect on development. For example, one might imagine that a stem cell from bone marrow would contribute to the population of, and thus modify the differentiation of the evolving bone marrow cells in the host embryo. To pilot these experiments, older embryo cells were introduced into young embryos resulting in modest success with colonization (Moustafa & Brinster, J. Exp. Zool. (1972) 18.:193) . 

 These initial experiments were followed by studies using bone marrow stem cells and teratocarcinoma stem cells (also called embryonal carcinoma cells) . There was evidence that both these cells colonized the developing embryo (Brinster, J. Exp. Med. (1974) 140:1049-1056) . In the case of the embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell, the colonization was demonstrated dramatically by a change in the color of hairs in the coat of the mouse. This was an exciting result which stimulated a great deal of interest among scientists in the field, because it showed the possibility of colonizing an animal with non- embryo cells. This would provide a means to introduce new genetic information through the DNA of the colonizing cells.The next year these results were confirmed and extended by two other laboratories (for work done in one of these laboratories, see Mintz & Illmensee, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. fUSA) (1975) 72:3585-3589) and it was demonstrated that the introduced EC cells may colonize numerous tissues including germ cells (sperm and eggs) . Thus, a gene that was mutated, modified, or added to the cell in vitro could eventually end up in sperm or eggs of an animal, creating a new genetic strain
