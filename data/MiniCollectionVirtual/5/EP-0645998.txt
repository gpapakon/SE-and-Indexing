<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to hair treatment formulations such as hair relaxers, permanent waving agents and depilatories. These formulations are produced utilizing a microemulsion. While it would be expected that such microemulsions would be more irritating than their macroemulsion counterparts, the opposite has been found to be true.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MICROEMULSIFIED HAIR TREATMENT PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF MAKING SAME TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to the field of personal grooming products and methods of their production and, more particularly, to hair relaxers, permanent wave compositions and depilatories. BACKGROUND ARTEmulsions have been used for many years in personal grooming products and in particular hair products. Of these emulsions, macroemulsions are typically used in a variety of contexts including skin care, hair relaxers, and hair creams. Macroemulsions are particularly useful in that they are generally nonirritating to the skin. They are, however, generally opaque and have other properties which render them less desirable for certain cosmetic and grooming applications. Macroemulsions may also have poor shelf stability, particularly in the case of hair relaxers and related products.In contrast, microemulsions are generally clear, have a glass-like resonance and have pleasant tactile qualities. Microemulsions have better shelf stability and produce products which are more appealing to the eye. Because the surfactant (amphiphilic surface active agents) content of microemulsions is relatively high, hair penetration is better. This makes microemulsions an attractive alternative as a cosmetic and grooming system. Unfortunately, the use of higher levels of amphiphilic surface active agents also has its disadvantages. As previously described, microemulsions are created by the use of relatively large concentrations of amphiphilic surface active agents, i.e. greater than about 10% by weight, as compared to macroemulsions, which rarely contain greater than about 

5-7% by weight. These amphiphilic surface active agents are generally very irritating to the skin and eyes.When one considers the composition of conventional styling products such as, hair relaxers, permanent waving agents and depilatories, it is not surprising that macroemulsions have been the emulsion system of choice. Formulations such as, for example, hair relaxers, often employ relatively strong caustic substances, such as various protein hydrolyzing agents, to break the disulfide bonds and peptide bonds which provide hair with its natural shape. These aggressive agents are extremely irritating to the skin and eyes. It is not surprising, therefore, that one would attempt to utilize an emulsion system in connection with these products which is as nonirritating as possible so as to minimize the overall irritation qualities of the resulting product. Certainly, the use of
