A rotor and flexible drive shaft assembly for a 
progressive cavity pump or motor in which the rotor 10 is 

provided with an end portion 12 and the drive shaft 20 is 
provided with a head portion 18. A transverse spirally 

wound sheet metal pin 24 is engaged in the first passage 16 
in the end portion 12 and a second passage 22 in the head 

portion 18, a retaining sleeve 26 preventing the pin from 
falling out, the retaining sleeve itself being held in place 

by a circlip 32.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor and 
flexible drive shaft assembly for a progressive cavity pump 
or motor. The invention is particularly concerned with a 
progressive cavity pump or motor having an outer member, 
usually a stator, which has female helical gear formation 
thereon having n starts and a rotor, rotatable within said 
stator and having a male helical gear formation of the same 
pitch but with n Â± 1 starts. In former years the rotor was driven by means of a 
drive shaft having a universal joint at each end, for 
example FR-A-1256957. More recently, however, the rotor is 
driven by a flexible drive shaft see, for example, GB-A-1220848; 
GB-A-1285377; GB-A-1562277 and GB-A-2244517. By way of example GB-A-1285377 discloses a rotor 
and flexible drive shaft assembly for a progressive cavity 
pump or motor, said rotor having a rotor body with a helical 
gear formation thereon, an end portion of said rotor having 
an axial blind bore therein, a flexible drive shaft, a head 
portion of said drive shaft engageable in said axial blind 
bore, a first transverse passage in the end portion of said 
rotor intersecting the blind bore therein, a second 
transverse passage in said head portion of said drive shaft, 
said first and second passages being aligned with one 
another and being of substantially the same diameter, a 
sleeve surrounding said end portion, means for holding said 
sleeve on said end portion, at least one sealing ring 
providing a seal between said sleeve and said end portion 
and a pin engaged in said first and second passages. Such a drive arrangement has been very 
satisfactory. However, the method of connecting the drive 
shaft to the rotor is somewhat complex and expensive and is 
not always entirely satisfactory if it is necessary to 
rotate the drive shaft in either one rotational direction or  
 
the other. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome such disadvantages and the present invention is 
characterised in that said first and second passages extend 
fully through said end portion of said rotor and said head 
portion of said drive shaft, in that said sleeve is a 
retaining sleeve surrounding said end portion, and retaining 
said pin in said first and second passages, in that said at 
least one sealing ring is mounted on said end portion and 
within said sleeve providing a seal between the retaining 
sleeve and the end portion of the rotor, and in that said 
means for holding said sleeve on said end portion directly 
engages said sleeve and said end
