<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of supplying 
lubricant to a machine, in particular an internal combustion 
engine comprising a stepper motor controlled lubricant pump as 
well as a system for supplying lubricant to a machine, in 
particular lubricating system for an internal combustion engine 
comprising a lubricant supply unit having a lubricant pump, in 
particular for performing the method of supplying lubricant to 
a machine. The necessity for lubricating mechanism and machine having 
moving parts is well known. Various types of lubricating 
systems have been proposed including both closed systems in 
which the lubricant is recirculated and so-called open 
systems wheerein the lubricant is supplied to the mechanism 
and dissipated to the atmosphere during the mechanism 
operation. Although the latter type of system has the 
advantage of simplicity, the discharge of lubricant to the 
atmosphere can cause obvious problems. Under the machines involved internal combustion engines are 
a specific example of mechanisms which require lubrication. 
Generally four-cycle engines are lubricated by closed 
systems while two-cycle engines, because of their very 
nature, are lubricated by open systems. Although it was 
previously the practice to lubricate a two-cycle engine by 
mixing lubricant with the fuel which it consumed, these 
lubrication methods are not at all satisfactory because they 
provide the same amount of lubricant under widely varying 
running conditions while the actual engine requirements are 
different. In addition, they tend to provide excess 
lubricant so that the most severe conditions will be met and 
thus there is a large amount of lubricant consumed and 
discharged to the atmosphere.  
 Systems have been proposed for providing direct delivery of 
lubricant to the engine and the measuring of the amount of 
lubricant required and supplying only that amount of 
lubricant required for a given running condition. 
Conventionally these systems have employed lubricant pumps 
that are driven by the engine with the amount of lubricant 
varied by either changing the delivery intervals for the 
lubricant or by changing the amount of lubricant pumped by 
the pump during each cycle. Although these systems offer 
more accurate control of the amount of lubricant than when 
it is mixed with the fuel, they still have some 
disadvantages. For example, if the delivery interval is changed in order to 
control the amount of lubricant delivered to the engine, the 
effect ofinternal leakage within
