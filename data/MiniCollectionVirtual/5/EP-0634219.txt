<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for grinding materials of different granular size, in which particles of material to be ground, which are thrown off over the edge of a grinding dish (6), are transported upwards in a helical flow close to the housing wall with the aid of a gas-conducting arrangement (19) which generates a twisting or rotating flow. Under the influence of centrifugal force and gravity, a particle flow is formed essentially from external granular material which, as a deaerated dense flow (17), is not involved in the actual grinding and sifting process and is extracted at least in part from the grinding/sifting space. An extraction arrangement (25) is arranged on the housing wall in the radial direction above the grinding path and connected to a mechanical conveying arrangement, in particular for guiding back into the grinding/sifting space.

Method for crushing material of different grain
size, in which the material is supplied to a rotating,

horizontally positioned grinding surface (5) of
a grinding-classifying chamber (8) having a casing

wall (15) and is crushed to grinding material particles,
the grinding material particles are supplied

with the aid of a fluid delivery flow (9) to a classifying
process, fine material particles are discharged

and a portion of the oversize occurring as coarse material
particles is removed and in which grinding material

particles (13) spun over the edge of the grinding
surface (5), which are moved upwards in a helical

flow by the fluid delivery flow (9), close to the casing
wall (15) an outer oversize flow (18) is formed,
characterized
 in that,

oversize fractions are removed from the outer oversize
flow (18), which is an almost fines-free vented

concentrated flow (17), through a device (25) in the
casing wall (15) on level with the classifier (29), are

passed to an external mechanical conveying device
(36) and returned to the grinding surface (5).
Method according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that,

there is a continuous removal of oversize fractions
from the outer oversize flow (18).
Method according to claim 1 or 2
characterized
 in that

the oversize fractions are removed from the oversize
flow (18) under air exclusion.

characterized
 in that,

the oversize fractions are removed from the outer
oversize flow (18) in tangential direction and collected

Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that

a classifier (29) separates internal oversize material
from the grinding material and above the grinding surface

chamber (8) and that the inner oversize

material, together with the oversize fractions of the
outer concentrated flow (18) are again supplied with

the aid of the mechanical conveying device (36) on the
rotary grinding surface (5) by means of an external

circuit for further crushing purposes.
