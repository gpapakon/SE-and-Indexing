<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for controlling the kiln gas stream (90, 138) in a conventional long wet or dry process cement kiln (10). A portion of the kiln gas stream (90) can be withdrawn from the rotary kiln vessel (17) at a point upstream, relative to kiln gas flow of the chain system in the mineral drying zone (24). Alternatively, or in conjuction with bypass formation, the apparatus (256) can be used to add tertiary air to the kiln gas stream (90) to promote combustion efficiency downstream of the clinkering zone (28). Use of the present apparatus (56, 156) to form a kiln gas bypass stream (64) enhances operating efficiencies of long kilns by reducing dust loss, by facilitating isolation of high alkali by-product streams, by reducing alkali content of collected kiln dust, by increasing energy efficiency of long kiln operation, and by allowing greater overall control in the cement manufacturing process.

 METHOD FOR IMPROVED MANUFACTURE OF CEMENT IN LONG KILNSBackground and Summary of the InventionThis invention relates to improvements in the operation and configuration of long rotary cement kilns. More particularly it is directed to a method and apparatus for enhancing the capacity and efficiency of cement clinker production in conventional wet or dry process long rotary kilns. A portion of the kiln gases is withdrawn from the rotary vessel at a point upstream, relative to kiln gas flow, of the mineral drying zone and pre-heating zone to form a kiln gas bypass stream. In the widely used commercial process for the manufacture of cement, the steps of drying, calcining, and clinkering cement raw materials are accomplished by passing finely divided raw materials, including calcareous minerals, silica and alumina, through a heated, inclined rotary vessel or kiln. In what is known as conventional long dry or wet process kilns the entire mineral heating process is conducted in a heated rotating kiln cylinder, commonly referred to as a "rotary vessel." The rotary vessel is typically 12 to 15 feet in diameter and 400-700 feet in length and is inclined so that as the vessel is rotated, raw materials fed into the upper end of the kiln cylinder move under the influence of gravity toward the lower "fired" end where the final clinkering process takes place and where the product cement clinker is discharged for cooling and subsequent processing. Gas temperatures in the fired clinkering zone of the kiln range from about 1300째 to about 1600째C. Kiln gas temperatures are as low as about 250째 to 350째C at the upper mineral receiving end of so-called wet process kilns. Somewhat higher gas temperatures exist in the upper end of long dry process kilns. 

 Generally, skilled practitioners consider the cement making process within the rotary kiln to occur in several stages as the raw material flows from the cooler gas exit mineral feed end to the fired/clinker exit lower end of the rotary kiln vessel. As the mineral material moves down the length of the kiln it is subjected to increasing kiln gas temperatures. Thus in the upper portion of the kiln cylinder where the kiln gas temperatures are the lowest, the in-process mineral materials first undergo a drying process and thereafter move into the hotter calcining zone and finally into the portion of the kiln where the kiln gas temperatures are the hottest, the clinkering zone adjacent to the fired lower end of the kiln cylinder. The kiln gas stream flows counter to the flow of
