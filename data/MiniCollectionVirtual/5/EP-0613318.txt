<ABSTRACT>
A reference microphone (5) is disposed close 
to a primary microphone (6) through an enclosure wall 

(7) of an appliance incorporating microphones, and a 
noise generated by mechanical systems and included in an 

output of the primary microphone is cancelled by an 
adaptive filter (8). In a smaller hardware scale than a 

case of mounting a sensor for noise reference directly 
to a noise source, a noise component can be cancelled 

more effectively depending on changes of noise 
environments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microphone apparatus 
to be built in an appliance possessing a mechanical system 
generating noise or mechanical vibration in its enclosure. In downsizing trend of appliances, such as video cameras 
and cassette tape recorders, possessing recording 
function, microphones installed in such appliances have been 
changed from a type projecting from an enclosure of an 
appliance, to a type built in a small space provided in a 
part of the enclosure. However, for example, in case of a 
video camera, since various mechanical systems are incorporated 
in its enclosure such as a tape running system for 
recording and a lens driving system for zooming function, a 
noise or mechanical vibration generated by the mechanical  
 
systems are transmitted to a built-in microphone, and a 
signal-to-noise ratio is significantly lowered when picking 
up sound. A microphone apparatus for reducing the noise generated 
by the mechanical systems incorporated in the appliance by 
using an adaptive filter has been already proposed (for 
example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 
3-295400). The microphone apparatus comprises a primary 
microphone, a vibration pickup unit provided in a mechanical 
system as a noise source, and an adaptive signal processing 
unit for reducing a noise mixed into an audio signal using a 
detected signal as a reference signal. Thus composed microphone 
apparatus mimics an impulse response of a transmission 
path from a vibration source to the primary microphone by 
the adaptive filter, and a false noise generated by convoluting 
the impulse response having mimicked a signal detected 
by the vibration pickup unit is added in opposite phase 
to an output signal of the primary microphone. The noise 
generated by the mechanical systems may be classified in two 
types, that is, noise component radiated in air and transmitted  
 
to the primary microphone as a sound wave, and vibration 
noise component excited in the primary microphone by 
vibration transmitted through the enclosure, and both are 
caused by vibration of the mechanical systems. It is therefore 
possible to reduce the noise component contained in the 
output signal of the primary microphone, by directly detecting 
the vibration of the mechanical systems as a noise 
source, and using the detected signal as the reference 
signal. In case of the microphone apparatus mentioned above: 
In the appliance possessing recording function, 
usually, numerous mechanical parts are mounted at high 
density in the
