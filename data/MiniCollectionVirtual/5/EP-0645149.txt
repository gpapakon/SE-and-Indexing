<ABSTRACT>
A fully absorbable prosthesis (1) for the repair of 
damaged ligaments and/or tendons in the form of a multilayer 

spiral roll comprising the following spiral layers: a 
foraminous layer (2) of a synthetic bioabsorbable material; 

a bioabsorbable film (3); and a layer (4) of a bioabsorbable 
biopolymer sponge. The invention also provides a method of 

making such a prosthesis, comprising the steps of: providing 
a laminate of a foraminous layer of bioabsorbable material 

and a bioabsorbable film; coating the laminate with a layer 
of an aqueous gel comprising a bioabsorbable polymer; 

rolling up the laminate and the gel layer into a spiral 
roll, followed by drying the gel to form a layer of 

bioabsorbable sponge. The foraminous layer (2) preferably 
comprises a synthetic bioabsorbable polymer having high 

tensile strength. The bioabsorbable film (3) and sponge 
layer (4) preferably comprise a chemotactic biopolymer such 

as collagen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbable structures
for use as temporary prostheses in the repair of damaged
ligaments and/or tendons.Damage to ligaments and/or tendons is a frequent
occurrence, particularly as a consequence of violent
exercise or contact sports. An especially common and
difficult to treat sports injury is tearing of the anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.Various approaches have been tried to restore the
function of torn tendons or ligaments. The simplest
approach is simply to suture together the torn ends of the
ligament or tendon. However, the healing rate of ligaments
or tendons sutured in this way is extremely slow, and even
after healing is complete the strength of the ligament or
tendon is substantially reduced. Moreover, the scar tissue
tends to propagate into surrounding tissues causing
discomfort and loss of mobility.In another approach, the ligament or tendon is replaced
by a permanent prosthesis of biocompatible but non-resorbable
material, such as Dacron®, PTFE or polypropylene.
A favoured permanent prosthesis consists of bundles of
carbon fibers, optionally coated with a biocompatible
polymer. However, none of the permanent prostheses has
proved to be sufficiently durable to replace a ligament or
tendon for the life of a user. In particular, it has been
found that the carbon-fiber based prostheses tend to crack
after 12-18 months of use, thereby releasing carbon
particles that can cause severe inflammatory reactions and
even arthritis.A further approach to the repair of damaged tendons or
ligaments has been to implant a temporary, biodegradable
prosthesis that can stabilize the tendon or ligament and
provide a framework for healing of the tendon or ligament
while gradually being absorbed into the body. Accordingly,
the requirements for such a temporary prosthesis include:
high tensile strength to restore tendon or ligament 
function, slow but complete bioabsorption in situ, low
antigenicity, and a directional (uniaxial) structure that
promotes formation of strong, well-oriented scar tissue by
directional ingrowth of fibroblasts from the undamaged ends
of the ligament or tendon.WO85/00511 describes a collagen-based material for
regeneration of ligaments and/or tendons. The material is
formed from strands of collagen that have been cross-linked
with glutaraldehyde to increase their tensile strength. The
collagen strands are provided in the form of a suitable
weave with sufficient space between the strands to function
as a "scaffold" through which ligament
