<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal projection panel (30) for use in a projection system (10). 
The projection panel is comprised of a large number of pixels (26) provided 

between two transparent substrates (22, 24). Microlens arrays (32, 34) are 
provided on both sides of the projection panel. The microlenses in both arrays 

have focal lengths such that parallel light rays (
A, A
') entering the microlenses at 
an angle perpendicular to the arrays are focused at points (
F, E
) beyond the image 
plane (26) of the display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to liquid crystal displays, and more
particularly to liquid crystal display projection panels which include microlens
arrays.Thin, lightweight liquid crystal displays have become popular for use in
electronic presentation devices, computer displays, and entertainment devices. In
particular, active matrix addressed liquid crystal displays (most commonly of the
thin film transistor type) offer high information content, full color, high contrast,
and fast video refresh rate. However, these liquid crystal displays suffer from low
transmission, typically 3-5%, which necessitates high power backlights and
reduced ambient lighting. A major factor in the low transmission is the aperture
ratio of about 30-40% to accommodate space for transistors and bus lines on the
display.Each of EP-A-440 495 and EP-A-516 479 discloses a projection panel
comprising two arrays of microlenses which are arranged such that the
focal points of the microlenses share a common focal plane.It would be desirable to have a liquid crystal projection panel having
improved brightness.Accordingly, the present invention provides a projection panel as specified in claim 1.The present invention also includes a projection system including the
projection panel described above, a light source emitting light rays toward the
display, and a means for projecting light rays exiting the panel toward a viewing 
screen. The projection panel may be positioned between two fresnel lenses which
collimate the light rays entering the panel.The present invention also includes a method of making a pixellated display
projection panel. The method includes providing a panel such as described above,
but wherein the thicknesses of the substrates vary within a known range around an
average value. The optimum radius of curvature for the microlenses is selected
based on the upper end of the range of thicknesses of the substrates.FIGURE 1 shows a schematic cross-sectional side view of a liquid crystal
projection panel according to the present invention.FIGURE 2 shows a close-up view of the projection panel shown in
FIGURE 1.FIGURES 3 and 4 show close-up schematic views of prior art projection
panels.FIGURE 5 is a graph of light transmission versus substrate thickness.A liquid crystal projection system 10 according to the present invention is
shown in FIGURE 1. Projection system 10 includes a liquid crystal display (LCD)
20, having a plurality of pixels 26 arranged regularly between two optically
transparent substrates 22 and 24, and
