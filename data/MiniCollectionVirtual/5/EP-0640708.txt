<DESCRIPTION>
Nonwoven fabrics were developed in an attempt to
produce an inexpensive fabric by eliminating many of the
various steps required to produce woven or knitted
fabrics. Initially, nonwoven fabrics were produced from
card or air-laid webs of fibers which were bonded with a
chemical binder. Such fabrics have relatively limited
usage because their strength characteristics were poor
compared to woven or knitted fabrics and their absorbency
and softness characteristics left something to be desired
because of the use of chemical binders. Major advances
were made in eliminating or considerably reducing the
amount of binder used in a nonwoven fabric by rearranging
or entangling the fibers in a fibrous web to produce what
are termed "yarn like" fiber segments and entangled fiber
areas. Methods and apparatus for producing fabrics of
this nature are more fully disclosed in U.S. Patents
2,862,251, 3,033,721, and 3,486,168. While these
techniques improve the strength characteristics of
nonwoven fabrics, they still did not have the strength
characteristics of the woven or knitted fabrics. These
entangled or rearranged fiber fabrics did require less
binder and, hence, had good absorbent characteristics and
excellent softness. As a result of this, nonwoven fabrics
found primary uses in many products such as sanitary
napkins, disposable diapers, replacement gauze, medical
bandages, and the like. While such products were accepted
for uses where absorbency and softness was desired, the
various different fiber areas would absorb differently.
For example, yarn-like structures would absorb different
than non-yarn-like structures. Furthermore, many of these
fabrics included apertures or holes and while suitable for 
facing materials, were not suitable for some absorbent
products unless used in multi-layer configurations. While
nonwoven fabrics have gained wide acceptance, it is still
desired to improve the absorbent characteristics of such
fabrics and make them more efficient in use.It is an object of the present invention to produce
a nonwoven fabric having improved absorbent
characteristics. It is a further object of the present
invention to produce a nonwoven fabric having relatively
uniform absorbent characteristics. It is still a further
object of the present invention to produce a nonwoven
fabric that has improved absorbent characteristics without
any deleterious effects on the other desired properties of
nonwoven fabrics.Nonwoven fabrics of the present invention have
substantially uniform absorbent characteristics in all

A nonwoven fabric having a repeating pattern of
three interconnected fiber arrays;


a first fiber array comprising a plurality of
parallel fiber segments;
a second fiber array adjacent to said first
fiber array, said second fiber array comprising a
