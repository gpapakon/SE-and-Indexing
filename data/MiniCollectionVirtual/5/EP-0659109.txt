<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sheet metal profile, preferably a so-called high profile of high bearing capacity, comprising an upper flange part (1), two webs (2, 3) which extend down from the upper flange part and the bottom ends of which merge with a web-connecting bottom flange part (4). The sheet metal profile is stiffened by providing the webs (2, 3) with stiffening, local impressions (5) in the transverse direction of the metal sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet metal profile,
preferably a so-called high profile of high
bearing capacity and including an upper flange part,
two webs which extend downwardly from said flange part
and the bottom ends of which merge with a bottom
flange part which connects said webs,
see for example SE-A-8 003 209.
The invention
also relates to a method of manufacturing the sheet
metal profile.With the intention of stiffening sheet metal profiles
of the aforesaid kind in order to increase their
bearing capacity, it has earlier been usual to provide
the profile with a stiffening profiled section which
extends in the longitudinal direction of the profile.
This stiffening profile section can be provided at the
same time as the metal sheet is given its main profiled
shape.Despite the aforesaid formation of sheet metal profiles
with the intention of stiffening the profiles,
it has nevertheless been found difficult to obtain
thin sheet metal profiles which are able to support
more than their own weight when the metal sheet has a
span in excess of about 5-6 meters.Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to
provide a novel sheet metal profile of high bearing
capacity which is able to manage spans which exceeds
the aforesaid value. A further object of the invention
is to provide a method for the manufacture of the
novel sheet metal profile.These objects of the invention are achieved with a
sheet metal profile and a method having the characteristic
features set forth in the following claims. The invention will now be described in more detail
with reference to a non-limiting, exemplifying embodiment
thereof and also with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates part of
the web of a sheet metal profile containing impressions
in accordance with the invention; Figure 1a is a
side view of the web and shows the impressions according
to the invention; Figure 1b is a sectional view
taken on the line A-A in Figure 1a and illustrates the
web subsequent to the metal sheet having passed
through a first pair of rolls; Figure 1c is a view
corresponding to Figure 1b but showing the metal sheet
subsequent to having passed through a second or a last
pair of rolls; Figure 2 is a schematic side view of
two roll pairs which form the stiffening impressions
in the sheet metal profile in accordance with the
invention; and Figure 3 is a sectioned view showing a
widened abutment surface of the roll pairs at the
precise moment of pressing the stiffening impressions
in said metal plate,

<CLAIMS>
A sheet metal profile, preferably a so-called high profile having a high bearing
capacity and compromising an upper flange part (1), two webs (2, 3) which extend down

from the flange part and the bottom ends of which merge with a bottom flange part (4) which
connects the webs (2, 3), whereby the webs (2, 3) are provided with

local stiffening impressions (5) in the transverse direction of the metal sheet,
characterised in that the

local
stiffening impressions are made as first local impressions to a predetermined depth and

thereafter the impressions being pressed back to a final and smaller depth.
A profile according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the impressions
(5) in the webs are formed alternately outwards and inwards.
A profile according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the
impressions (5) have essentially the shape of a parallelogram, with a greater extension in the

height direction of the webs (2, 3) than in the longitudinal direction of the profile.
A profile according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the impressions
(5) slope alternately in relation to the transverse direction of the profile.
A profile according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that the flange parts (1, 4) of the metal sheet are provided with stiffening grooves (6) in
the longitudinal direction of the profile.
A profile according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that generally U-shaped strengthening profiles (7) are placed beneath the upper flange parts
(1), with the legs (8, 9) of said strengthening profile supporting against the upper flange parts

(1), and with the horizontal part (10) of respective U-shaped strengthening profiles lying
essentially in line with the bottom flange part (4) of said profile.
A profile according to Claim 6, 
characterized
 in that the legs (8, 9)
of the U-shaped strengthening profiles are provided with local impressions (11).
A method for manufacturing a sheet metal profile according to any one of Claims
1-7, 
characterized
 by feeding a thin metal sheet (12) between at least one pair of 
mutually coacting rolls (13) provided with raised parts (15) and recesses (16) such as to form

local impressions to a first predetermined depth in the metal sheet (12), that the impressions
thereafter are pressed back to a smaller depth and then feeding the metal sheet through a

profiling mill to profile the sheet.
A method according to Claim 8, 
characterized
 by feeding the metal
sheet (12) through two sequential roll pairs (13, 14), and in the first roll pair (13a, 13b)

pressing the impressions to the predetermined depth and in the second roll pair (14a, 14b)
pressing the impressions back to a smaller depth.
A method according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized
 by forming the
impressions alternately upwards and downwards in the metal sheet (12).
