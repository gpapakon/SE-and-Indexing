<ABSTRACT>
An adaptor cap assembly (10) is provided for a trocar, 
consisting of a base (20) which contains an opening (26) which is 

the same size as the opening of the trocar cannula handle. 
There is also a cap (45) integrally attached to the base (20) which 

contains a gasketing assembly (40) wherein the assembly (10) is of 
a smaller diameter than the diameter of the trocar cannula 

handle opening as well as the opening (26) in the base (20) of the 
adaptor cap assembly (10). This cap (45) is hingedly attached to 

the base (20) so that it can be flipped by using the thumb 
either into or out of alignment with the openings of the 

trocar cannula handle and the base (20) of the adaptor cap 
assembly (10). Thus, this mechanism can be used so that a 

smaller diameter instrument can be placed within a larger 
diameter opening (with the adaptor cap in place), or, the 

adaptor cap can be moved out of place so that a larger 
diameter mechanism can be inserted within the adaptor cap 

assembly and into the trocar cannula handle, with both the 
base and the trocar cannula handle having the same size 

opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns laparoscopic trocar 
assemblies. More particularly, this invention concerns an 
assembly which is attached to a trocar, and contains a 
mechanism for converting the opening to the trocar cannula 
from one diameter to another. With the rise in the use of laparoscopic surgery, it 
has been determined that there are additional needs 
necessary for operating a typical laparoscopic trocar. 
Specifically, it has been noticed that it may be desirable 
to convert the outer opening of the trocar cannula from a 
larger diameter to a smaller diameter. This smaller 
opening creates a seal about smaller diameter instruments 
used after puncturing the trocar with a laparoscopic 
obturator. Exemplary of such valving "reducer" mechanisms 
are Serial No. 618,325, now U.S. Design Patent No. 
D-335,536 assigned to Ethicon, Inc., and 
EP-A-0 568 383 similarly assigned 
to Ethicon, Inc., the assignee of the present invention. 
Both of these documents were made available to the 
public after the priority date of the present application. Also, there have been placed in the market products 
such as that described in WO-A-9304717 (which was made 
available to the public after the priority date of the 
present application) which contains an integral 
reducer cap, allowing a 10mm opening to be converted to a  
 
7mm opening or a 5mm opening. Such a system uses an 
integral sliding mechanism, which allows the seal to be 
rotated about a corner of the trocar cannula handle and 
emplaced over the 10mm opening created in the obturator 
handle. However, this arrangement is quite cumbersome for 
surgeons. This is so because the sliding mechanics of the 
seals make it such that the seals are incapable of being 
rapidly and easily put into place. The user must move his 
or her thumb from the side of the instrument and around 
the top of the cannula handle over the opening in the 
cannula handle. This can be quite a tricky one handed 
maneuver. US 4 112 932 discloses a device according to the pre-characterising 
portion of claim 1, comprising a cannula with a turret member 
which is moveable relative to the base member of the cannula 
to place a selected aperture in or out of alignment with the 
bore of the cannula.  
 What is desirable therefore is a reducer system which 
allows the user to rapidly and easily place the reduced 
opening in the reducer system over the opening of the 
trocar cannula. Also, it is an object of the invention to 
provide an integral system wherein there is no need to 
search on the
