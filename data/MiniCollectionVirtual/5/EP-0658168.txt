-independent antibodies against blood coagulation factors, employing an antibody selection strategy based on small peptides that are comprising target sequences for limited proteolysis. These antibodies, which substantially distinguish between intact and cleaved species of said haemostatic protein, provide novel tools for the isolation of intact haemostatic proteins. By virtue of the absence of cleavage products that usually are associated with side-effects or reduced efficacy, these intact proteins may serve as improved agents in therapeutic compositions for the treatment of haemostatic disorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of therapeutic
compositions consisting of purified blood coagulation factors
for the treatment of haemostatic disorders. Said compositions
are obtained by affinity chromatography employing antibodies,
more in particular monoclonal antibodies, that distinguish
between intact and cleaved molecular species. Methods are
disclosed to obtain such antibodies, which allow the isolation
of vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins, including
Factor IX, Factor VII, Protein C or Protein S, as intact polypeptides,
devoid of cleavage products representing activated or
degraded species.Inherited or acquired deficiencies of proteins of the blood
coagulation system provide a major cause for the occurrence of
haemostatic disorders. Even the lack or shortage of one single
component of this system may be sufficient to disturb the
delicate balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways
in a manner resulting in major clinical signs of bleeding or
thrombosis. One of the most common bleeding disorders is
Haemophilia A, which is due to deficiency or dysfunction of the
coagulation Factor VIII. Less frequently occurring, but equally
severe bleeding disorders include deficiencies of the
haemostatic proteins Factor IX (Haemophilia B), Factor VII, or
Factor X. On the other hand, thrombosis may occur as the result
of even partial (heterozygous or acquired) deficiency of Protein
C or Protein S, which are major components of a system that acts
as an antagonist of the coagulation pathway (for reviews on
haemostatic disorders see A.L. Bloom and D.P. Thomas (Eds.),
Haemostasis and Thrombosis, 2nd edition, Churchill-Livingstone, 
Edinburgh, 1987, pp 393-436 and 452-464). Replacement therapy is
considered as a powerful and effective means to restore the
haemostatic balance invivo. For instance, concentrates
containing Factor IX have proven highly valuable blood products
which are life-saving when used to control bleeding in patients
suffering from Factor IX deficiency.Commercially available Factor IX concentrates (so-called
prothrombin complex concentrates) usually are prepared with ion
exchange resins to separate Factor IX from the other plasma
proteins. This technique however, yields Factor IX preparations
that also contain a number of other, closely related haemostatic
proteins. These include Factor VII, Factor X, Factor II, Protein
C and Protein S, which all belong to the class of the vitamin K-dependent
proteins. The term "vitamin K-dependent" is referring
to the fact that these
