<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to zero fat whipped frozen dessert products. Such products can be regarded as a low calory alternative for ice cream. More in particular, the invention relates to zero fat whipped frozen dessert products having improved melting properties. Products showing a controlled melting behaviour were obtained by using a specific emulsifier blend.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zero fat whipped frozen 
dessert product. Such a type of product is generally known 
as a reduced calorific value substitute for ice cream. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a zero fat 
whipped frozen dessert product showing improved melting 
properties. Conventional ice cream and related products contain a 
substantial amount of fat (generally 8-14% by weight). 
Furthermore, they generally contain proteins (3-8%) and 
sugars (12-20%). Fat is herein to be understood to mean 
triglycerides. Minor ingredients generally present are 
stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavours and colorants. Such a 
conventional ice cream product has large calorific value 
mainly due to the presence of fat and sugars. Fat plays an important role in ice cream. It is generally 
known to the man skilled in the art that fat droplets or 
globules (partially coated with emulsifiers and proteins) 
are of prime importance for the stability and structure of 
ice cream. This structure can be considered to comprise air 
bubbles fixed in a matrix of solids and partially frozen 
liquids and emulsions. It is preferred for a good structure 
and stability that a part of said fat droplets are 
agglomerated or destabilized. These agglomerates are formed 
during processing of the ice cream emulsion. The 
destabilization of the fat droplets is a very critical 
process, depending on e.g. process conditions and amount 
and type of fat, proteins and emulsifiers used. The chances 
of getting too much agglomeration (resulting in an oily 
oral sensation upon eating) or no agglomeration at all 
(resulting in a poor structure of the ice cream) are 
considerable. Not only the structure of the ice cream is 
determined by the agglomeration, but also the melting  
 
behaviour is strongly influenced by it. It is desired that 
ice cream does not melt away too quickly, but it is also 
desired that melting does occur when the ice cream is 
exposed to elevated temperatures, otherwise the product 
will result in a mousse, which is a different product. 
Therefore, it is desired that ice cream exhibits a gradual 
or controlled melting behaviour when exposed to elevated 
temperatures, especially in the mouth upon eating. Melting 
behaviour of ice cream and related products can suitably be 
determined by using a standard melting test as disclosed by 
Arbuckle in "Ice Cream", The Avi Publising Co. 4th edition 
page 364 (1986). As stated above, among the factors having an influence on 
the agglomeration of fat droplets are
