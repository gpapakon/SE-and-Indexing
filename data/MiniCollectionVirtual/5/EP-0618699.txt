<ABSTRACT>
Backup device, for an arrangement of elements (3, 4) the operation of which implies the presence of at least one binary signal of defined period (HP) and the security of which is possibly related to the presence of such a signal, including routing means (10) for conducting, to the arrangement, either this signal as long as this first signal is detected by determination means (11) or a corresponding periodic signal (HS), called backup signal. The determination means consist of an elementary binary logic circuit (13), acting on the routing means under the action of an elementary binary counting circuit (12) verifying the presence of the first signal at a rate of a sample signal (HE), from which the backup signal is obtained by division.
