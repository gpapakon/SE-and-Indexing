<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to x-ray contrast compositions 
containing the contrast agents iodoaniline derivatives and 
methods for their use in diagnostic radiology of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Roentgenographic examination utilizing X-rays and 
computed tomography (hereinafter CT) scans of fractures and 
other conditions associated with the skeletal system is routinely 
practiced without the use of contrast agents. X-ray visualization 
of organs containing soft tissue, such as the gastrointestinal 
(hereinafter GI) tract, requires the use of contrast agents which 
attenuate X-ray radiation. D. P. Swanson et al in "Pharmaceuticals 
In Medical Imaging", 1990, MacMillan Publishing Company, 
provides an excellent background in medical imaging utilizing 
contrast agents and compositions therewith. Roentgenographic examination of the GI tract are indicated 
for conditions of digestive disorders, changes in bowel habit, 
abdominal pain, GI bleeding and the like. Prior to radiological 
examination, administration of a radiopaque contrast medium is 
necessary to permit adequate delineation of the respective lumen 
or mucosal surface from surrounding soft tissues. Accordingly, a 
contrast medium is administered orally to visualize the mouth, 
pharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum and proximal small 
intestine. The contrast medium is administered rectally for 
examination of the distal small intestine and the colon. The most widely used contrast agent for the visualization 
of the GI tract is barium sulfate administered as a suspension 
orally or rectally as an enema. (See, for example U.S. Patent Nos.: 
2,659,690; 2,680,089; 3,216,900; 3,235,462; 4,038,379 and 
4,120,946) Notwithstanding its relatively good contrast  
 
characteristics, negligible absorption from the GI tract following 
oral or rectal administration and speedy excretion from the body, 
barium sulfate has certain disadvantages. In the presence of 
intestinal fluids it lacks homogeneity and poorly adheres to 
mucus membranes which can result in poor X-ray images. In the 
colon, when administered as an enema, it flocculates and forms 
irregular clumps with fecal matter. Iodinated organic compounds have also been used as 
GI contrast agents since the iodine atom is an effective X-ray 
absorber. They have the most versatility and are utilized in the 
widest variety of procedures. They are very absorptive of X-rays 
with which the iodine interacts and produce a so-called 
photoelectric effect which is a large magnification in contrast 
caused by the
