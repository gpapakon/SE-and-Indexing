<CLAIMS>
A fuel supply system for a multicylinder internal 
combustion engine with a fuel injection system, comprising 

a fuel distributor (1) with a tubular distributor housing 
(2) and with at least one fuel feed connection (3) as well 

as with at least one fuel return connection (4), the fuel 
distributor (1) having a number of first location holes (5) 

which correspond to the number of injection valves, and a 
second location hole (7) being arranged in the region of an 

end boundary (6) of the distributor housing (2), and, for 
fuel supply to an internal combustion engine with at least 

two rows of cylinders, a fuel distributor (1) being used for 
each row of cylinders, the fuel distributors (1) being 

connected to one another by a connecting line in a manner 
which allows the passage of fuel and being arranged in 

series, and a pressure control valve (9) being arranged in 
the second location hole (7) of one of the two fuel 

distributors (1), characterized in that a pressure test 
connection (10) is accommodated in the second location hole 

(7) of the other fuel distributor (1) and in that the fuel 
distributors (1) are of matching design. 
A fuel supply system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fuel distributors (1) are composed 

of a fuel- and heat-resistant polymeric material. 
A fuel supply system according to either of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the flow of fuel through the 

fuel distributors (1) from the fuel feed connection (3) 
towards the fuel return connection (4) is in the same sense. 
A fuel supply system according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the pressure control valve (9) and 

the pressure test connection (10) have matching connection 
regions (11) for mounting in the fuel distributors (1), and 

in that the pressure test connection (10) is arranged 
liquid-tightly in the second location hole (7) of the first  

 
fuel distributor (1.1) in the direction of fuel flow (12) 

and the pressure control valve (9) is arranged liquid-tightly 
in the second location hole (7) of the second fuel 

distributor (1.2).
