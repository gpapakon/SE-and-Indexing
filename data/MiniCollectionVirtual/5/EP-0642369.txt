<ABSTRACT>
A capacitor-discharge implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has a relatively smaller displacement volume of less than about 90cc. The smaller volume of the ICD is achieved by selecting and arranging the internal components of the ICD to deliver a maximum defibrillation countershock optimized in terms of a minimum physiologically effective current (Ipe), rather than a minimum defibrillation threshold energy (DFT). As a result of the optimization in terms of a minimum effective current Ipe, there is a significant decrease in the maximum electrical charge energy (Ec) that must be stored by the capacitor of the ICD to less than about 30 Joules, even though a higher safety margin is provided for by the device. Due to this decrease in the maximum Ec, as well as corollary decreases in the effective capacitance value required for the capacitor and the net energy storage required of the battery, the overall displacement volume of the ICD is reduced to thepoint where subcutaneous implantation of the device in the pectoral region of human patients is practical. The size of the capacitor is reduced because the effective capacitance required can be less than about 125 (my)F. By optimizing both the charging time and the countershock duration for the smaller maximum Ec, the size of the battery is reduced because the total energy storage capacity can be less than about 1.0 Amp-hours. In the preferred embodiment, the charging time for each defibrillation countershock is reduced to less than about 10 seconds and the pulse duration of the countershock is reduced to less than about 6 milliseconds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of automatic,
implantable cardioverters and defibrillators. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
that is a capacitor-discharge device having its internal components,
including a battery and a capacitor, selected and arranged in such a manner
that the ICD has a relatively smaller displacement volume that permits
effective subcutaneous implantation of the device in the pectoral region of
human patients.Existing implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are typified by
a relatively large size that usually requires implantation of the prosthetic
device in the abdominal cavity of a human patient. In order to allow for
effective subcutaneous implantation of a prosthetic device in the pectoral
region of a human patient, the maximum size of the prosthetic device
needs to be less than about 40-90cc, depending upon the physical size and
weight of the patient. Unfortunately, all existing ICDs have total
displacement volumes of at least 110cc or greater. Even though there are
numerous advantages to developing an ICD having a displacement
volume small enough to permit implantation of the device in the pectoral 
region of a human patient, to date it has been difficult to develop a
practical ICD having a total displacement volume of less than about 100cc.For reasons of simplicity and compactness, existing ICDs are
universally capacitor-discharge systems that generate high energy
cardioversion/defibrillation countershocks by using a low voltage battery
to charge a capacitor over a relatively long time period (i.e., seconds) with
the required energy for the defibrillation countershock. Once charged, the
capacitor is then discharged for a relatively short, truncated time period
(i.e., milliseconds) at a relatively high discharge voltage to create the
defibrillation countershock that is delivered through implantable
electrode leads to the heart muscle of the human patient. From EP 0 437 104 A2 a method and apparatus for measuring
defibrillation electrode resistance are known, whereby a
subthreshold current pulse is sourced across the electrodes
and the resulting voltage is measured so that the electrode
resistance can be calculated from these values. The calculated
electrode resistance then may be utilized to adjust
the energy level of defibrillation shock used to treat a
detected tachyarrythmia. This can be done by adjusting the
duration of the defibrillation shock based upon the determined
electrode
