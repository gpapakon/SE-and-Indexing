<ABSTRACT>
A device for adjusting the reticle of an aiming telescope 
has a pair of threaded spindles disposed at right angles 

to each other and engaging a thread in an intermediate 
housing on the main tube. The threaded spindles act on an 

inner tube with the reticle mounted movably within the main 
tube. The threaded spindles are connected in rotationally 

firm fashion with a snap-in locking device which engages 
snap-in recesses in the intermediate housing distributed 

about the threaded spindle. The index plate provided is an 
axially displaceable turning knob to be coupled with the 

snap-in locking device by positive locking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for adjusting
the reticle of an aiming telescope having threaded spindles
disposed at an angle to each other to engage a thread in an
intermediate housing on the main tube and act on the inner
tube with the reticle mounted movably within the main tube,
a snap-in locking device connected with each threaded spindle
in rotationally firm fashion and engaging snap-in recesses
in the intermediate housing distributed about the
threaded spindle, and a rotary member to be coupled with the
snap-in locking device and having a marking which is adjustable
by rotating the rotary member to a marking fixed on
the telescope.Such adjusting devices are known
(for instance aiming telescopes "Diatal" or "Diavari"
of Hensoldt AG, Wetzlar, Germany).
For adjustment a pair
of threaded spindles disposed perpendicular to each other
are generally rotated so that the reticle in the inner tube
is shifted perpendicular to the main tube axis until it coincides
with the meeting point. These spindles are usually
operated via a coin slot or a small grip bar on the top of
the spindle. The snap-in locking device connected with the
spindle via a ring in rotationally firm fashion serves as a
locking piston and helps the user select the necessary adjusting
distance. That is, the snap-in recesses in the intermediate
housing can be a distance apart such that the
angle of rotation covered by the snap-in locking device from
one recess to the next corresponds to a deviation from the
meeting point of e.g. 1 cm for a certain range, for example
100 m. The lock into the next snap-in recess can generally
be both felt and heard.The rotary member for marking the set adjustment in the
known device is an index plate disposed rotatably on a ring
on the threaded spindle and fixable e.g. with a screw. For
setting the basic adjustment the screw is loosened so that 
the index plate can be aligned with the marking fixed on the
telescope, i.e. a zero point on the main tube.The known device is disadvantageous in that a coin must
be used for a coin slot and, on the other hand, it is troublesome
to perform correct adjustment with the small grip
bar difficult to grip. Furthermore a tool is required for
operating the screw on the index plate.The invention is therefore based on the problem of
providing an easy-to-operate aiming telescope adjusting device
for precise adjustment without tools.This is obtained according to the invention by an adjusting
device

<CLAIMS>
A device for adjusting the reticle of an aiming
telescope having threaded spindles disposed at an angle to

each other to engage a thread in an intermediate housing (5) on
the main tube (1) and act on the inner tube (2) with the reticle

mounted movably within the main tube, a snap-in locking
device connected with each threaded spindle in rotationally

firm fashion and engaging snap-in recesses in the
intermediate housing distributed about the threaded

spindle, and a rotary member (20) to be coupled with the snap-in
locking device and having a marking which is adjustable by

rotating the rotary member to a marking fixed on the
telescope, characterized in that the rotary member is

formed as an axially displaceable turning knob (20) to be
coupled with the snap-in locking device by positive

locking, the turning knob (20) having a toothing (25) and
at least one spring member (26) engaging the toothing (25)

and urged into the engaged position by the turning knob
(20) being provided on the snap-in locking device.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the
snap-in locking device is fastened to a hub (10) connected

with the threaded spindle (9) in rotationally firm fashion.
The device of claim 2, characterized in that a serration
(11) is provided for the rotationally firm connection

between threaded spindle (9) and hub (10).
The device of claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the hub (10) is mounted on the intermediate housing (5).
The device of any of the above claims, characterized
in that for fixing the turning knob (20) in the engaged or

disengaged end position the hub (10) has a pair of recesses
(21, 22) at an axial distance, and the turning knob (20) has

at least one catch spring (23) engaging one or the other
recess (21, 22). 
The device of any of the above claims,
characterized in that the turning knob (20) is cup-shaped

and the toothing (25) is provided on the inner wall (24) of
the turning knob (20).
The device of claim 6, characterized in that the
turning knob (20) has an annular groove (29) whose inner

groove face (30) urges the spring member (26) against the
toothing (25).
The device of any of the above claims, characterized
in that the hub (10) has a circumferential portion (15) to

which the spring members (26) and the snap-in locking device
are fastened.
The device of claim 8, characterized in that the
snap-in locking device has a housing (16) fastened to the

circumferential portion (15) with a catch member (17)
mounted displaceably therein.
The device of claim 8, characterized in that the
snap-in locking device has a holding device (31) with the

catch member (17) pivoted to the circumferential portion
(15).
The device of claim 10, characterized in that for
spring loading the snap-in locking device radially outward a

spring ring (33) is provided which extends about the hub
(10) and is fastened to the circumferential portion (15).
The device of claim 9 or 10, characterized in that
the hub (10), the circumferential portion (15), the spring

members (26) as well as the housing (16) or the holding device
