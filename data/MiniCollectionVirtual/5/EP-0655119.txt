<ABSTRACT>
The particulate fuel is induced to follow a different flow path from that of its transport air, as the fuel and transport air pass through the distribution device. The pattern and density of distribution of particulate fuel in the transport air then becomes controlled by the re-entrainment of the fuel into the transport air rather than by flow characteristics of the fuel and transport air entering the nozzle (10). In the distribution device the fuel particles are moved in a direction (56) axially opposite to the forward axial feed direction (40) to the furnace and into a space (44) having a reflector wall (60) against which the fuel particles (38) impinge in a rebounding action. The reflector wall scatters the fuel particles into the path of the primary air in a wide dispersion pattern, which ensures good perimeter distribution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 07/931,381, filed August 18, 1992. The present invention relates to fuel nozzles for 
burners which feed solid, particulate fuel, such as 
pulverized coal, to a furnace. The particulate fuel is 
entrained in transport air, sometimes referred to as 
primary air, for delivery of the fuel and primary air 
through the nozzle to the combustion zone of the furnace. 
Another part of the burner handles the delivery of the 
combustion air, sometimes referred to as secondary air, 
for supporting combustion. A common problem in the field is that the solid 
particulate fuel fed to the furnace by the fuel nozzle of 
a burner does not enter the combustion zone of the 
furnace properly distributed. A number of factors 
typically result in the transport air-to-fuel ratio 
varying across the transport pipe. Areas in which the 
particulate fuel is denser than desired are referred to 
as areas of "dense phase flow." Such areas are also 
sometimes referred to as "ropes", since the dense phase 
flows tend to run in streams which follow ever-changing 
paths, which streams have the appearance of moving 
"ropes." Various attempts have been made to minimize the dense 
phase flow problem and to also provide a uniform 
distribution of fuel around the perimeter of the nozzle. 
One approach is use of a splash plate, against which the 
fuel impinges, followed by a venturi diffuser. Another 
approach is a centrifugal distributor with an inward 
conical tip on the coal nozzle to achieve a similar 
effect. Yet another approach swirls the fuel-air mixture 
as it enters the nozzle by blocking flow at part of the 
nozzle entry elbow. None of these approaches eliminates the dense phase 
flow or roping effect, and some of the approaches have 
the added disadvantage of interposing obstructions in the  
 
path of the particulate fuel, which obstructions are 
subject to unacceptably high levels of rapid wear. Another approach has involved the use of some of 
features of the present invention in the context of 
particulate fuel burners but for different purposes. 
Specifically, GB-A-313 100 describes an apparatus and 
method for delivery of particulate fuel entrained in 
transport air to a furnace in which the particulate or 
powdered fuel is divided to two streams having different 
densities. One stream carries a rich mixture formed by 
the tendency of the particulate fuel to move toward the 
circumference of a passageway which extends in a 
circumferential direction around

a central axis (11) and which nozzle discharges solid, 

particulate fuel entrained in transport air into a furnace (24) 
in a forward axial feed direction (40), the nozzle including a 

nozzle body (12); an inlet (50) in said nozzle body for receiving 
particulate fuel entrained in transport air; a discharge section 

(70) downstream of said inlet (50) for directing air and 
particulate fuel into the furnace (24); and a passageway (42) 

within said nozzle body (12), which passageway (42) circumscribes 
the central axis (11) of the nozzle (10) to impart a 

circumferential flow of fuel and air with respect to the central 
axis (11) of the nozzle (10), the circumferential flow creating 

a tendency for fuel particles to move toward the circumference 
of the passageway under the influence of centrifugal force, this 

tendency in turn creating different flow paths for different 
components of the air and fuel mixture, which flow paths are 

ultimately recombined, said passageway (42) having a rearward 
axial directional component (56) opposite in direction to the 

forward axial feed direction (40) and a forward axial directional 
component (66) corresponding with the forward axial feed 

direction (40), such that flow of particulate fuel (38) and air 
(36) through such passageway is changed from a flow having a 

rearward axial directional component (56) to a flow having a 
forward directional component (66); a particle reflector wall (60) in said 

passage way (42), said particle reflector wall (60) acting as a reflecting
