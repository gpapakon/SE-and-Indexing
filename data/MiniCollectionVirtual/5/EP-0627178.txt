<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a moisture management component 
incorporated in a garment (10) for moving moisture away 

from the skin of the wearer. The moisture management 
component includes a first and second fabric. The first 

fabric comprises a moisture wicking panel (11) carried 
by the garment for moving moisture away from the skin. 

The moisture wicking panel (11) has a skin-side surface 
and an obverse surface, and an opening therethrough from 

the skin-side surface to the obverse surface. The 
second fabric comprises a moisture transport insert (12) 

extending through the opening in the moisture wicking 
panel (11) to move moisture from the skin of the wearer 

to the outer fabric layers of the garment (10) for 
dispersal and evaporation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to moisture management 
components and garments incorporating moisture 
management components. Prior art garments tend to absorb moisture and 
hold moisture next to the skin. This is disadvantageous 
because it can lead to chafing, irritation and conditions 
conducive to bacteria, fungus and yeast growth. Prior art garments for people with minor to moderate 
incontinence also have the disadvantage that they do 
not look like ordinary garments. This can result in 
embarrassment to the wearer and can discourage use. Many disposable urinary incontinence products 
concentrate the moisture away from the skin in a small 
bulky area. Thus, these types of garment require 
frequent changing and do not promote the evaporation of 
moisture. It is an object of the invention to obviate and/or 
mitigate these disadvantages.  According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a moisture management component for use in a 
garment for moving moisture away from the skin of a 
wearer, said moisture management component including: 
(a) a first fabric comprising a moisture wicking 
panel which can be carried by said garment for moving 
moisture away from the skin, and having a skin-side 
surface and an obverse surface; said moisture wicking 
panel defining an opening therethrough from said 
skin-side surface to said obverse surface; and (b) a second fabric comprising a moisture 
transport insert extending trhough the opening in said 
moisture wicking panel, and having: 
(1) a first portion positioned in overlying 
relation on the skin-side surface of the moisture 
wicking panel for receiving moisture from the skin and 
from the moisture wicking panel; and (2) a second portion positioned in overlying 
relation on the obverse surface of said moisture wicking 
panel for receiving moisture from the first portion of 
the moisture transport insert and for transporting said 
moisture through the opening to the obverse face of the 
moisture wicking panel for dispersal. According to another aspect of the invention there 
is provided a garment, the improvement comprising a 
moisture management component for moving moisture away  
 
from the skin of a wearer, said moisture management 
component including: 
(a) a first fabric comprising a moisture wicking 
panel carried by said garment for moving moisture away 
from the skin, and having a skin-side surface and an 
obverse surface; said moisture wicking panel defining an 
opening therethrough from said skin-side surface to said 
obverse surface; and (b) a

A moisture management component for use in a 
garment for moving moisture away from the skin of the 

wearer, said moisture management component including: 

(a) a first fabric comprising a moisture wicking 
panel which can be carried by said garment for moving 

moisture away from the skin, and having a skin-side 
surface and an obverse surface; said moisture wicking 

panel defining an opening therethrough from said 
skin-side surface to said obverse surface; and 
(b) a second fabric comprising a moisture 
transport insert extending through the opening in said 

moisture wicking panel, and having: 

(1) a first portion positioned in overlying 
relation on the skin-side surface of the moisture 

wicking panel for receiving moisture from the skin and 
from the moisture wicking panel; and 
(2) a second portion positioned in overlying 
relation on the obverse surface of said moisture wicking 

panel for receiving moisture from the first portion of 
the moisture transport insert and for transporting said 

moisture through the opening to the obverse face of the 
moisture wicking panel for dispersal. 
A moisture management component according to claim 
1, wherein the first portion of said moisture transport 

insert can reside generally in a lower crotch area of 
 

said garment and is relatively narrow with a relatively 
small surface area; and the second portion of said 

moisture transport insert can reside generally in an 
upper crotch area of said garment and is relatively wide 

with a relatively large surface area, said second 
portion being adapted to provide greater moisture 

absorption capacity in the upper crotch area of the 
garment to promote the transport of moisture upwardly 

towards a drier area of the garment where moisture can 
more easily be dispersed. 
A moisture management component according to claim 
2, wherein the width of said.moisture transport insert 

tapers from the relatively wide second portion towards 
the relatively narrow first portion.
