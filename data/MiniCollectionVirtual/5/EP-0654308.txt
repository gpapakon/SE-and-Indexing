<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a method for grain-size analysis in the fine and very fine range by means of a gas-jet screen, the screening material being delivered onto the screen fabric, a gas jet being blown through the screen fabric and the screening material by means of a slit nozzle (2) rotating underneath the screen fabric, fine fractions being entrained by the gas stream and being transported by the latter in the opposite direction through the screen fabric to a discharge orifice located underneath the screen fabric, the said method allowing exact and accurately reproducible measured values, it is proposed that the gas stream be recorded quantitatively and be kept constant over the course of the screening operation.

Method for particle size analysis in the fine and 
very fine particle size range by means of a gas jet 

screen, in which the screen material is applied to the 
screen netting, a gas jet is blown through the screen 

netting and the screen material by means of a slot-type 
nozzle rotating underneath the screen netting, fine 

components are entrained by the gas flow and transported 
by the gas flow in the opposite direction through the 

screen netting to a discharge opening disposed underneath 
the screen netting, characterized in that the gas flow is 

determined in terms of amount and is kept constant over 
the course of the screening operation. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the temperature and/or the humidity of the gas stream 

supplied is determined and regulated to a required value. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the gas supplied is purified by a filter device. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the screening time is set and maintained 

accurately to the second. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the amount of particles in the exhaust-gas 

stream is determined and a termination criterion for the 
analysis is derived therefrom. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the data determination and the required-value 

regulation is carried out digitally by means of a 
microcontroller system.

Venturi nozzle and a differential pressure measuring 
device on the nozzle, or a Prandl tube, a heated-wire 

quantity measuring device, and a measuring turbine and in 
that a regulating device is coupled to the device producing 

the supply gas flow to keep the quantity of gas 
constant. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that
