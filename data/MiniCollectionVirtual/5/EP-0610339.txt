<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID FLOW CONTROL SYSTEMTechnical Field of the Invention;The invention is generally directed to fluid flow control systems and, more particularly, to a system for preventing fluid flow, particularly water flow, whenever a break or leak in the system occurs.Background of the Invention;The damage caused by water leaking from a broken water line in a house or building can be extensive and typically exceeds several thousand dollars per household. Water destroys hardwood floors, carpeting, linoleum floors, etc. and can even cause a floor's foundation to warp. While the present inventor has no specific evidence as to how much water damage occurs in the United States alone each year, it is expected to run into the millions. Accordingly, a need exists for a system that will minimize the water damage which results when a break in a building's water line occurs.U.S. Patent No. 4,180,088 to Mallet addresses this problem with a water leak detection system which uses a water flow sensing device to shut off a valve on the incoming water line when water flow in the line is detected. The system can not be used during periods of normal water usage since the water flow which results, for example, when a simple faucet is turned on would activate the system and thereby shut off the supply of water. Accordingly, this system is only realistically usable when the homeowner intends to be away from home for an extended period of time or does not expect to use the system, for example at night. However, use of the system at night is not realistic either since most homeowners use bathroom facilities at night. Other patents disclosing apparatus and systems for preventing or shutting off fluid flow are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,735,231; 3,506,033; 2,160,766; 2,012,351; 3,800,827; 1,173,966; and 1,956,010.While all the aforementioned patents disclose systems for preventing fluid flow in one situation or another, a need still exists for a system which is capable of minimizing the leakage 

 of water into a home or building at all times, i.e. is always on or and does not have to be switched on by the homeowner or building supervisor.Disclosure of the Invention; The present invention addresses the aforementioned problems by providing a fluid flow supply system that minimizes fluid leakage whenever a leak in a fluid line occurs. In its broadest sense, the system controls fluid flow between a first point and a second point on a fluid line. The system includes a first valve located at the first point on the fluid line for opening

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS What is Claimed;
1. A system for controlling fluid flow between at least a first point and a second point on a fluid line, said system comprising: a first valve located at the first point on the fluid line for opening to permit forward fluid flow from the first point to the second point on the fluid line and for closing to prevent such forward fluid flow; fluid flow sensing and control means for detecting forward fluid flow at the second point and for opening said first valve when such flow is detected, said fluid flow sensing and control means also closing said valve when no forward fluid flow at the second point is detected; and a second valve located at the second point for opening and closing to control forward fluid flow at the second point, said system preventing forward fluid flow by preventing said first valve from opening whenever a system depressurizing leak occurs in the fluid line between the first and second points, said first valve being prevented from opening by said fluid flow sensing and control means which will not open said first valve since forward fluid flow cannot occur and thus cannot be detected at the second point when said second valve is opened if such a leak is present.
2. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the first valve is an electrically controlled solenoid valve.
3. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the second valve is a water utilizing device.
4. A system as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said water utilizing device is a faucet.
5. A system as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said water utilizing device is a dishwasher. 

6
. A system as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said water utilizing device is a washing machine.
7. A system as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said water utilizing device is a toilet.
8. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said fluid flow sensing and control means includes fluid flow sensors and electrical means for cooperating with said sensors to control said first valve so that said first valve opens when forward fluid flow is detected by said flow sensor and said first valve closes when forward fluid flow is not detected by said flow sensor.
9. A system as claimed in Claim 8 wherein said flow sensors are located on said fluid line at the second point.
10. A system as claimed in Claim 8 wherein said flow sensors are capable of detecting flow as low as 0.1 gallons per minute.
11. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein fluid flow is considered to have stopped at the second point when fluid flow is less than 0.1 gallons per minute.
12. A system for controlling fluid flow between at least two points on a fluid line, said system comprising: a normally closed electrically controlled valve located at a first point on the fluid line for opening when energized to permit fluid flow from the first point to a second point on the fluid line and for closing when deenergized to prevent such forward fluid flow; fluid flow sensing and control means for detecting forward fluid flow at the second point and for energizing said valve when such flow is detected, said fluid flow sensing and control means also deenergizing said valve when forward fluid flow through the fluid line at the second point stops; and 


 a second valve located at the second point for opening and closing to control forward fluid flow through the fluid line at the second point, said system preventing forward fluid flow if a system depressurizing break in the fluid line occurs between the first and second points by preventing said first valve from opening, said fluid flow sensing and control means preventing said normally closed valve from opening since forward fluid flow at the second point cannot occur when said second valve is opened if such a break in the fluid line occurs.
13. A method for controlling fluid flow between a first point and a second point on a fluid line, said method compromising the steps of: detecting forward fluid flow at the second point; permitting forward fluid flow at the first point when forward fluid flow at the second point is detected; and preventing forward fluid flow at the first point when forward fluid flow at the second point is not detected.
