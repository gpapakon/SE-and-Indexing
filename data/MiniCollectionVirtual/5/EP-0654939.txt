<ABSTRACT>
A data compression and transmission method for a facsimile 
which can reduce the data transmission time by performing optimum 

data compression. According to the method, the picture signal 
data is 1-dimension-compressed and 2-dimension-compressed, each 

length of the 1-dimension-compressed data and the 2-dimension -compressed 
data is compared with that of the original data which 

is not compressed, and as a result of comparison, the data which 
has the shortest data length is selected and then transmitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data compression and 
transmission method for a facsimile which compresses and 
transmits picture signal data read out from a picture or a 
document. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a data compression and transmission method for a facsimile which 
can achieve optimum data compression, and thereby reduce the data 
transmission time by selectively transmitting one of 1-dimension-compressed 
data, 2-dimension-compressed data and original data in 
accordance with the length of the compressed data, and then 
decoding the transmitted data. According to a conventional facsimile, the picture signal 
data is compressed and transmitted in accordance with a 
prescribed specification, regardless of the length of the 
compressed data. FIG. 1 shows an algorithm explaining a conventional method 
of data compression and transmission for a facsimile. Referring 
to the method of FIG. 1, the read-out picture signal data is 
compressed by a CODEC (coder-decoder) and then transmitted as 
follows: First, the value of a register K is set to 'O' and a 
predetermined value is stored in another register Kpara in 
accordance with a selected transmission mode. For example, if  
 
the transmission mode is a normal mode (3.85 lines per 
millimeter), '2' is stored in the register Kpara, and if a fine 
mode (7.7 lines per millimeter), '4' is stored in the register 
Kpara. Thereafter, it is determined whether the data of the current 
line to be compressed is the end of the page to be transmitted. 
If so, the transmission operation is stopped. If not, the value 
stored in the register K is checked. At this time, if the value 
in the register K is '0', 1-dimensional compression of data is 
performed, '1' is added to the value in the register K, and then 
it ist again determined whether the current line data is the end 
of the page to be transmitted. Meanwhile, if the value in the register K is not '0', 2-dimensional 
compression of data is performed, '1' is added to the 
value in the register K, and then the added value in the register 
K is compared with the value stored in the register Kpara. At 
this time, if it is determined that K<Kpara as a result of the 
comparison, it is again determined whether the current line data 
is the end of the page to be transmitted. If it is determined 
that K≧Kpara, '0' is stored in the register and then it is again 
determined whether the current line data is the end of the page 
to be transmitted. FIGs. 2A and 2B show the states of data

<CLAIMS>
A method of data compression and transmission for a 
facsimile, comprising the steps of: 

   determining and storing a length of original picture signal 
data to be transmitted; 

   performing 1-dimensional compression and 2-dimensional 
compression with respect to the picture signal data, determining 

and storing each length of the 1-dimension-compressed data and 
the 2-dimension-compressed data; 

   comparing the length of the original picture signal data, 
the 1-dimension-compressed data, and the 2-dimension-compressed 

data with one another; 
   selecting one among the original picture signal data, the 1-dimension-compressed 

data, and the 2-dimension-compressed data 
which has the shortest length as a result of the comparison, and 

formatting the selected data into a predetermined format; and 
   transmitting the formatted data.

claim 1, wherein the data format is composed of a data length, a 

compression type, and the data to be transmitted, which are 
successively arranged for each line of the data. 
A method of data compression and transmission as claimed in 
claim 1, the lengths of the original picture signal data, the 1-dimension-compressed 

data, and the 2-dimension-compressed data

of a page to be transmitted; 

   stopping transmission of the data if the current line data 
is determined to be the end of the page to be transmitted; and 

   returning to the step of performing compression of the 
picture signal data if the current line data is determined not to 

be the end of the page to be transmitted. 
A method of data compression and transmission as claimed in 
claim 2, wherein the step of receiving and decoding the formatted

   determining whether the current line of the received picture 

signal data is the end of the page to be received; 
   stopping receiving and decoding of the data if the current 

line of the received data is determined to be the end of the page 
to be received; 

   determining the compression type of the received data if the 
current line of the received data is determined not to be the end 

of the page to be received; 
   printing the received data if the received data is 

determined to be the original data at the compression type
