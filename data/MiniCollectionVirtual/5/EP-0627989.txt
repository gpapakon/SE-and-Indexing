<ABSTRACT>
An a-axis high temperature superconducting film having preferential in-plane orientation is formed. In the preferred embodiment, an a-axis film has substantial amounts of superconductor (12) oriented with its c-axis in a unified direction parallel to the substrate (16). YBCO on neodium gallate (110) plane has resulted in a high temperature superconductor with over 80 % by volume being a-axis with in-plane orientation. These films are epitaxial. The preferred method of film growth is for in situ growth by a laser ablation. Preferably, the a-axis film is nucleated by laser ablation onto a substrate which is at a temperature of 50 to 100  DEG C less than the optimal substrate temperature for c-axis growth. Optionally, once a-axis nucleation has begun, the substrate temperature may be increased to optimize superconductor properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONA-Axis Hiσh Temperature Superconducting Films with Preferential In-Plane AlignmentField of the InventionThis invention relates to high temperature supercon¬ ductors and methods for their growth. More particularly, it relates to high temperature superconductors with their a-axis oriented perpendicular to the substrate, and having substantial in-plane alignment of the c-axis of the superconductor.Background of the InventionStarting in early 1986, with the announcement of a superconducting material having a critical temperature (the temperature at which a specimen undergoes the phase transition from a state of normal electrical resistivity to a superconducting state) of 30K (See e.g., Bednorz and Muller, Possible High Tc superconductivity in the Ba-La- Cu-0 System, Z.Phys. B-Condensed Matter 64, 189-193 (1986)) materials having successively higher transition temperatures have been announced. In 1987, the so called YBCO superconductors were announced, consisting of a combination of alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals such as barium and yttrium in conjunction with copper. See, e.g., Wu, et al, Superconductivity at 93K in a New Mixed-Phase Y-Ba-Cu-0 Compound System at Ambient Pressure, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 58, No. 9, pp. 908-910 (1987). Thirdly, compounds containing bismuth were discovered. See e.g, Maeda, A New High-Tc Oxide Superconductor Without a Rare Earth Element, J.J. App. Phys. 37, No. 2, pp. L209- 210 (1988) and Chu, et al, Superconductivity up to 114K in the Bi-Al-Ca-Ba-Cu-0 Compound System Without Rare Earth Elements, Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, No. 10, pp. 941-943 (1988) . Finally, superconductors including thallium have been prepared, generally where the compositions have various 

 s oichiometries of thallium, calcium, barium, copper and oxygen. To date, the highest transition temperatures for superconductors have been observed in thallium containing compounds. See, e.g., G. Koren, A. Gupta and R.J. Baseman, Appl.Phys.Lett. 54, 1920 (1989).A unifying characteristic of these newly discovered superconductors is that they all include copper oxide ("CuO") planes. While the size of the superconducting crystals is often small, sometimes on the order of only microns, when looked at locally, the CuO planes are essentially infinite. If the CuO planes are oriented parallel to the substrate, the film is termed a c-axis film. This plane is sometimes called the basal plane. However, if the CuO planes are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the film is termed an a-axis film. Fig. 1 shows a
