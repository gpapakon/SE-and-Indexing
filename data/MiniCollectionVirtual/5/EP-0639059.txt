<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combined desking (20) and panelling (2) system which provides an effective means for subdividing office space and defining work areas. Work surfaces (30) are provided and can be independently supported or supported by the panelling system. Power and communication wires and cables are distributed through and between the desking and panelling systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to office panelling 
systems and to desking systems. In particular, the 
invention relates to a combination panelling and desking 
system. Office panelling systems are now recognized as one 
of the best approaches for subdividing office space into 
individual work units or cells due to the flexibility of 
such systems to be changed to meet changing needs as well 
as the ability of the system to be dissembled and moved to 
other sites. Panelling systems now have the capability of 
conveniently providing high capacity power to particular 
work stations as well as allowing the distribution of 
communication wires and the like to work stations. TEKNION office panelling systems have gained wide 
acceptance in the marketplace and the structure of this 
panelling system is generally shown in United States Patent 
4,535,577, which is incorporated herein by reference. This 
system has individual office panels interconnected, with 
each office panel having an interior frame which supports 
decorative or functional cover elements to the exterior of 
the frame. Various horizontal channels are provided for 
securing of office accessories, such as work surfaces and 
overhead bins. This panelling system has gained wide 
acceptance in the marketplace and provides power at desk 
height. Panelling systems which support work surfaces to 
either side thereof are the most common system in North 
America, whereas in Europe, the approach has been to 
provide a desking system which is capable of supporting 
panels or partitions thereon. These two alternative  
 
approaches each have advantages and disadvantages. For 
example, in some cases, it is desirable to have a number of 
work surfaces laid out in a particular arrangement without 
any panels associated therewith. In other cases, it is 
desirable to merely subdivide the space without the need for 
work surfaces. In the first case, a desking system is more 
desirable, whereas in the second case, a panelling system is 
more desirable. These systems, because of the different 
principles involved, operate basically independently of the 
other type of system. There remains a need to provide a 
system which addresses the various demands of the 
marketplace while accommodating the ability to readily alter 
any work space environment. There also remains a need to 
provide a system where the storage of additional components 
is reduced. A system which includes a frame for a panelling 
arrangement which also can be combined with a desking 
arrangement
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system (1) for subdividing office space into a 
plurality of work stations, some of said work stations being 

defined by means of office panels (4) supporting work 
surfaces (30) to at least one side thereof, and some of said 

work stations being defined by a desking arrangement (20) 
having work surfaces (40) supported independent of said 

office panels; characterised in that said office panels (4) 
each include a frame (8) with at least one intermediate 

horizontal securing channel (10) extending across said panel 
(4) and forming a securing structure running the length 

thereof and exposed at a multiplicity of locations 
distributed along said securing channel (10); said horizontal 

securing channels (10) cooperating with and supporting 
vertical support members (32) of said work surfaces (30) 

supported from said panels (4), said vertical support members 
(32) engaging said horizontal securing channels (10) at any 

of said multiplicity of locations therealong; and
 
characterised in that at least one of said workstations is 

defined by work surfaces (30, 31, 40) supported by the 
combined office panels (4) and said desking arrangement (20) 

where the work surfaces (30, 31, 40) thereof are joined at a 
transition position intermediate the length of a panel (4) 

where one end of a work surface (30) adjacent said transition 
position is supported from one of said panels (4) 

intermediate the length of the supporting panel; said office 
panels (4) and said desking system cooperating such that 

transition positions can occur at any of a host of positions 
intermediate the length of a panel (4).  

 
A system (1) as claimed in claim 1 wherein at least 
some of said work surfaces (30, 40) can be interchangeably 

supported by said desking arrangement (20) or said panels (4). 
A system (1) as claimed in claim 1 including a 
supply of interchangeable work surfaces (30, 40) of various 

configurations, said supply of work surfaces (30, 40) 
allowing the work surface configuration to change by 

interchange of work surfaces (30, 40). 
A system (1) as claimed in claim 3 wherein said 
work surfaces (30, 40) include a plurality of transition work 

surfaces, each transition work surface having opposed offset 
end configurations to define said transition position in the 

longitudinal axis of the work surface formed between two 
adjacent work surfaces one supported from said office panels 

(4) and one supported from said desking system (20). 
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein each 
frame (8) includes two vertically spaced securing channels 

(10) and each of said vertical Support members (32) engage said 
channels (10). 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or 5 wherein said 
work surfaces (30, 40) are maintained in engagement with 

Support means (32) of said panels (4) and support means (42) 
of said desking system (20) by a spring detente arrangement 

(100, 102) and are releasable therefrom by applying an upward 
force on said work surfaces (30, 40). 
A system as claimed in claim 4 wherein said 
transition position is part of one of the work surfaces (30, 

40) of said desking arrangement (20) or said panels (4).  
 
A system as claimed in claim 7 wherein said work 
surfaces (30, 40) include transition work surfaces (30, 31) 

at least primarily supported in a cantilevered arrangement by 
said office panels (4). 
A system as claimed in claim 8 wherein said 
transition work surfaces define a transitions selected from 

the group of 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 135°, 150°, and 
180°. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein electrical 
power and or communication feeds are interconnected and pass 

between the panels (4) and the desking arrangement (20). 
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said work 
surfaces (30) are removable in segments, some of which 

terminate at a position intermediate the length of a panel, 
without detachment from adjacent segments. 
A system as described in any preceding claim 
including floor plates (45) which engage legs of said desking 

system at a transition position between work surfaces 
thereof disposed in a particular angular orientation to 

maintain said particular angular orientation therebetween.
