<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polyacetylene derivatives, and especially to the tetrahydro 
pyranol derivatives known as cunaniols, and their derivatives. The term "cunani" has long been used by Amerindians for a group of fast acting 
fish poisons.Such fish poisons are generally derived from plants, and especially from the 
leaves thereof. South America probably possesses greater numbers of recorded fish 
poison plants than any other continent. For example, Guyana is thought to have about 
40 such fish poison plants. Effective fish poisons may be derived from the root of the Kurukuruwai plant, or 
from the sap, leaves or stems of the Kumarau plant. The fruit of the Sisal plant may be 
crushed in water and used as a fish poison. The present invention however is concerned with a particular class of compounds 
which are polyacetylenes as set out in the claims herein, and their derivatives. These 
polyacetylenes include cunaniols of the following general formula: 
wherein R is -H, -alkyl, (especially methyl), -acyl or glycosidyl. The invention further 
embraces the corresponding anhydrocunaniols and cunanione and derivatives arising by 
hydrogenation of the hydrocarbon claim. The above compounds may be isolated from leaves of the plant 
Clibadium sylvestre 
(Aubl.) Baill., which is a member of the family Compositae, trans cunaniol 
being the most abundant. It has long been recognised that the crushed leaves of this 
plant in water cause fish to surface and jump out of the water. Death results from the 
poison following paralysis. Gill action appears to be maintained to the end. Cunani is 
used as a general fish poison, but is also mixed with some starch and made into small 
balls which are fed to fish, which become disorientated on eating it and are easily caught 
by hand. In the isolation of cunaniols, extracts of leaves from Clibadium sylvestre (Aubl.) 
Baill. may be prepared using refluxed petroleum 60/80, or in a cold extraction process 
with petrol 60/80, or in a mass extraction process using ethanol. The extract of cunani 
leaves may be further refined using a Quickfit and Quartz steady state counter current 
distribution machine (SSDM). The lower phase fractions from the SSDM may then be 
collected and concentrated. This extract may then be further purified, for example, by 
column chromatography, to obtain cunaniol acetate. The lower phase concentrate from the SSDM may be extracted e.g. with n-hexane, 
and submitted to column chromatography to obtain trans-cunaniol. Cunaniol acetate can be isolated
