<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a connector for tubes for medical purposes, comprising a female coupling member 2 with internal cone 4, a male coupling member 3 with external cone 5 having the same conical form and a connection device, which is characterised in that a bayonet closure is provided as the connection device and that the outer cone 5 has a groove 6a with an elastic sealing ring 6. It is distinguished, in particular, by advantageous functionality and simple handling.

<CLAIMS>
Hose connector for vacuum drainages, comprising a female coupling member
(2) with an inner cone (4), a male coupling member (3) with an outer cone (5)

of the same conical shape, the outer cone (5) having a groove (6a) with an
elastic sealing ring (6), and a connecting means, 
characterized in that
 a bayonet
lock is provided as the coupling means, formed by two bayonet pins (7) at

the male coupling member (3) which pins correspond to two curved bayonet
grooves (8) of the female coupling member (2), and the elastic sealing ring

(6) provides for the sealing effect between the two coupling members (2, 3) in
the connected state, and the bayonet lock (7, 8) is dimensioned such that a

defined gap (19) is formed between the inner cone (4) and the outer cone (5)
upon connecting the coupling members (2, 3).
