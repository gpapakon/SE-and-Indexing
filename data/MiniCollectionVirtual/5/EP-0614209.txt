<ABSTRACT>
A flat panel display (100, 362, 400, 450) with a 
screen (104), apertures (112) in a sheet of material 

(108) and electron sources (106). A potential difference 
is established between the screen (104) and the sheet 

(108). The electron sources (106) are positioned under 
the numerous apertures (112) which focus the electrons 

from the sources (106) to different positions on the 
screen (104). Additional electrodes (325, 350) are 

positioned in the display to further focus and steer the 
electrons toward the screen (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a video 
display and more particularly to a flat panel display. One of the hurdles to reducing the cost, the size and 
the weight of a television or a computer is its display. 
Researchers have been trying for a long time to make a low 
cost and high resolution flat panel display that is 
reliable, efficient and easy to manufacture. One prior art approach for a flat panel display has a 
flat phosphor screen set at a high voltage and multiple 
layers of insulated metallic grids set at low voltages. 
Electrons emitted from sources are modulated by the low 
voltages on the metallic grids as they propagate through 
the grids, and are accelerated by the high voltage to form 
images on the screen. The intervening metallic grids serve 
as focusing structures. Unfortunately, it is expensive and 
difficult to reliably make and align multiple layers of 
insulated metallic grids with small enough apertures for 
high resolution images. Another prior art approach uses dynamically varying 
voltages applied onto phosphor stripes on a screen. This 
is known as the switched-anode technique. The sources 
commonly used for such an approach are field emission 
cathodes which are solid state electron-emitters controlled 
by gates. A general discussion on field emission cathodes 
can be found in "Physical properties of thin-film field 
emission cathodes with molybdenum cones," written by C.A. 
Spindt et. al. The screen is located very close to the 
gates of the field emission cathodes without any 
intervening focusing grid structures. A number of positive 
voltages on the numerous phosphor stripes attract the 
electrons from the sources to form images on the screen.  With the screen very close to the gates, to prevent 
voltage breakdown, the potentials on the screen are 
comparable in magnitude to the potentials on the gates. 
This implies that the potential differences between the 
screen and the gates are low leading to electrons reaching 
the screen with low energy; this in turn reduces the 
electron-to-light conversion efficiency of the display. A significant number of the electrons do not reach the 
screen. They are collected by the gates. Since the 
potentials on the screen are comparable to the potentials 
on the gates, the fact that a significant number of 
electrons are collected by the gates implies wasting a 
significant percentage of the power. This leads to a low 
power efficiency display. Also, images usually vary dynamically. This requires 
a dynamically varying
