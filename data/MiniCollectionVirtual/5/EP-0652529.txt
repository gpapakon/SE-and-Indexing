<ABSTRACT>
A high-reliability optical mark reader for a latent image mark capable of accurately reading code information 
of a latent image mark. The reader comprises a projector element (4) for projecting onto the surface of the latent 

image mark (15), which contains a fluorescent substance and has specified information, light having a wavelength for 
excitation of the fluorescent substance, and a light receiving element (8) for receiving fluorescence emitted from the 

surface of the latent image mark (15). A range where a latent image mark is readable is defined with an intersection 
of optical axes of the projector element and the light receiving element as a reference, and a crossing angle (ϑ) of the 

two optical axes is restricted to 40° or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
reading apparatus for optically reading a latent image mark 
containing a fluorescent substance by projecting infrared 
rays to the latent image mark and optically detecting light 
emitted by the latent image mark. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to the disposition relationship 
between a light-projecting member and a light-receiving 
member of a handy type optical reading apparatus for 
reading the information of the latent image mark by 
bringing the optical reading apparatus into contact with an 
object such as a commodity on which the latent image mark 
has been formed or moving it to a position close to the 
object. In a conventional bar code of reflection type, 
printing ink containing carbon black is generally used. A 
bar code is printed on a sheet of paper with the printing 
ink, and a bar code reader optically detects the difference 
between the reflectivity of a bar code-printed portion of  
 
the paper and that of a bar code-unprinted portion thereof 
so as to read the code information which the bar code has. The bar code of reflection type has, however, a 
disadvantage of causing errors in reading the information 
of the bar code in that the outlook of the commodity is 
damaged because the bar code is printed on the surface of a 
commodity or the like or the above-described reflectivity 
difference becomes small when the bar code-printed surface 
of the commodity is soiled. In order to overcome the disadvantage, there are 
proposed various methods of printing a latent image mark 
containing fluorescent substances and projecting infrared 
rays to the latent image mark so as to optically detect 
light emitted by the latent image mark. Fig. 12 is a view for describing this kind of 
conventional optical reading apparatus. A latent image 
mark 100 such as a bar code is printed on a mark carrier 
101, for example, a commodity, a component or the like. 
The latent image mark 100 contains fluorescent fine powder. 
A projecting member 103 projects light for exciting the 
fluorescent substances and as a result, fluorescence is 
emitted by the latent image mark 100 and received by a 
light-receiving member 104, so that the code information of 
the latent image mark 100 is read optically.  When the above-described conventional optical 
reading apparatus is used as a handy type optical reading 
apparatus, it is incapable of reading the code information 
of the latent image mark 100 correctly, thus causing 
erroneous detection and being
