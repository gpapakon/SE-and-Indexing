<ABSTRACT>
A volume flowmeter for media (1') comprises an ultrasonic measuring path in a measuring tube (1), two measuring transducers (2, 3) for ultrasound, a transmitting element (4), a control element (20) equipped for the generation of sequences S of successive operating cycles AN and two drive branches (5; 6) connected in parallel between the transmitting element (4) and a measuring element (7), a tapping (17 or 18) of the drive branch (5 or 6) being used for connecting the measuring transducers (2; 3). Temperature-dependent measuring errors can be eliminated if, in at least one of the drive branches (5 or 6), predetermined values dependent on the transmitting and measuring signals from the operating cycle are impressed onto the phase change, first phase-shifters (14; 14') shifting the phase of the transmitting signal by a value  alpha ,  alpha ', and the phase of the measuring signals being shifted by a value  beta ,  beta ' in the second phase shifters (15; 15'). The supply of values for the phase changes  alpha ,  alpha ',  beta ,  beta ' covers the range from 0@ to 180@.

A volume flow meter for liquid or gaseous media (1') having 
an ultrasonic measurement section in a measurement tube (1) between 

two measurement transducers (2, 3) for ultrasound, an oscillator (19)
