<ABSTRACT>
A protective film is placed on acrylic sheet. The film has a polyethylene side and an adherent EVA side; it will survive stressful lamination procedures as well as thermoforming, and can be easily removed from a finished article after thermoforming.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acrylic sheets
and laminates which have improved vacuum
thermoforming properties. The improved properties
are imparted by the use of an outer layer of a thin
film which has two surfaces -- a polyolefin or other
thermoplastic, and a surface of ethylene/vinyl
acetate copolymer blend. The ethylene/vinyl acetate blend side of the
film adheres lightly to the crosslinked acrylic
surface. The described combinations of substrate
and film can survive the thermal and physical
stresses not only of the thermoforming process, but
also of the preceding lamination process, so that
the film can be left on the thermoformed product and
used as a protective cover which can easily be
removed at the point of ultimate use of the
thermoformed product.Acrylic sheets are made in thicknesses of about 0.2032 to 1.27 cm
(about .08 to about .500 inch) and used in relatively
small areas of about 0.46 m2 about 5 ft.2 and large area pieces of
as much as 16.6 m2 200 ft.2. They are commonly thermoformed
into large consumer and other products such as
indoor and outdoor spas, tub/shower enclosures,
skylights, bathtubs and highway signs. They may be 
used as monolithic polymethylmethacrylate sheets or
as laminates of such acrylic sheets with other
thermoplastics such as ABS. Prior to the present
invention it has been known to place a protective
film on the acrylic sheet prior to thermoforming,
and to employ such film as a protective layer which
is intended to be removed only after the
thermoforming process. Some kinds of protective
materials, such as those based on paper, are totally
unsuitable for the thermoforming process since they
cannot be stretched or conformed to the shape of a
mold -- thus, if they are used, they can be used to
protect the sheet only up to a point prior to
thermoforming, where they must be removed.
Frequently new protective wrappings or coatings must
be placed on the product after thermoforming. A
prior commercial process and product we are familiar
with employed a polyethylene film as a protective
layer which ostensibly could be left on during
thermoforming. But the polyethylene film was often
extremely difficult to remove after thermoforming,
and caused other problems such as pitting in the
acrylic surface due to the generation of air bubbles
under the film.In the case of acrylic/ABS laminates such
as are made by the method of U.S. Patent 5,069,851
to Hicks et al and other laminates such as
acrylic/PVC laminates, it has been difficult to
place the film on the acrylic -- a separate step
