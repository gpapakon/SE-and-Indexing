<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator (1) has a body part (2) which bounds a cooling compartment and to whose one side wall (4) a refrigerator door is linked. Height-adjustable shelves (7) are mounted on the inner sides of the side walls (4) of the cooling compartment. In order to design these shelves to be extensible with the possibility of any desired height adjustment, the side walls (4) are provided, in mutually parallel, horizontal planes, with in each case two catch recesses (5) which are arranged spaced apart and are provided with sloping or rounded portions in the direction of the opening side of the refrigerator. The lateral front edges of the shelves (7) have guides consisting of grooves (12) in which in each case a slide-like element (13) is displaceably guided, which is provided on both sides, via resilient connecting pieces (17, 18), with catch projections (19, 20) which drop into the catch recesses (5). The engagement of the catch projections (19, 20) in the catch recesses (5) is releasable after cancellation of a retention by pulling out the shelf (7) with the slide-like elements (13).

Refrigerator (1) with a main body part (2) defining a 
refrigerating compartment, at the one side wall (4) of 

which a refrigerator door (3) is hinged, and with 
shelves (7) mounted at the inner sides of the side walls 

(4) of the refrigerating compartment such that they can 
be adjusted as to height,
characterized in
that in horizontal planes parallel to each other, the 
side walls (4) are provided with two engagement recesses 

(5), respectively, which are spaced from each other and 
which are provided with bevelings or curvatures in the 

direction towards the opening side of the refrigerator 
(1), 
that the lateral front edges of the shelves (7) have 
guide means consisting of grooves (12) in which a 

slide-like element (13; 45) is slidably guided, 
respectively, which, on both sides and through resilient 

connecting parts (17, 18; 46, 47), is provided with 
engagement projections (19, 20; 48, 49) snapping into 

the engagement recesses (5), and 
that the engagements of the engagement projections (19, 
20; 48, 49) in the engagement recesses (5) are 

releasable after removal of a locking by drawing out the 
shelf (7) with the slide-like elements (13; 45). 
Refrigerator according to claim 1, characterized in that  
 

the engagement projections (19, 20) are provided with 
extensions (21, 22) at their back sides which form 

positioning elements and which are supported on the 
groove bases (15) of the guide means and which lock the 

engagement projections (19, 20) in the engagement 
recesses (5), that the groove bases (15) are provided 

with openings (25, 26) in a release position (figures 5 
and 6) of the shelf (7), into which the extensions (21, 

22) are immersable. 
Refrigerator according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the lock consists of an element (30) which is 

arbitrarily actuatable and can be inserted or pivoted 
into the groove, said element preventing a displacement 

of the slide (13) into the release position or locking 
the engagement projections (19, 20) in the engagement 

recesses (5). 
Refrigerator according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the element (30) forms a stop for the slide (13) which 

can be released when it is actuated, or it forms a lock 
and has a pin (31) or the like which locks the slide 

(13) in its release position in groove (12). 
Refrigerator according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the lock consists of a two-armed, rocker-like lever (28, 

29), respectively, which is pivotally supported at the 
front edges (6) of the shelves (7), and which at the end 

of its outer lever arm carries the stop or lock (30) and 
at the end of its inner lever arm carries the pin (31), 

and that the lever is acted upon by a spring (36) in the 
direction towards the engaged position of the stop or 

lock (30).  
 
Refrigerator according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the lever arm (29) carrying the pin (31) forms an 

actuating key. 
Refrigerator according to any one of claims 4 through 6, 
characterized in that the slide (13) has a block-like 

center part (14) which is provided with a slot (16) and 
into which the pin (31) can engage for locking the slide 

(13) in the release position. 
Refrigerator according to any one of claims 1 through 7, 
characterized in that the shelves (7) consist of plates 

(8) which engage into grooves (9) of lateral edge 
profiles (6), and that the edge profiles (6) are held 

together by brackets (10). 
Refrigerator according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the connecting parts connecting the engagement 

projections with the slide-like element consist of 
strip-like parts with resilient arcs. 
Refrigerator according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that with the outside of each slide-like element (45) a 

holding web (54) is connected which has a resilient 
plate overlapping a wall delimiting the groove, said 

plate carrying a web (57) at its side pointing towards 
the shelf center which stands orthogonal to the plate, 

said web extending in a supporting manner behind the 
side of the guide means pointing towards the center of 

the shelf. 
Refrigerator according to claim 10, characterized in  
 

that the plate (55) rises from the holding web in an 
acute angle towards the wall (56) delimiting the groove 

for forming a push-button and has a projection at its 
lower side which aligns with an engagement recess in the 

wall of the guide means when the shelf is in the 
inserted or pushed-out position, and that by pressing 

the button the projection snaps into the engagement 
recess in a position in which the extensions forming the 

positioning elements can immerse into the openings. 
Refrigerator according to any one of claims 10 or 11, 
characterized in that the slide-like element (45) at its 

side opposite the holding web (54) has a further web 
carrying an arm overlapping the upper side or lower side 

of the guide means, and that between the arm and the 
slide-like element a U-shaped recess is formed which 

borders the outer edge section of a wall delimiting the 
guiding groove. 
Refrigerator according to any one of claims 10 through 
12, characterized in that between the part of the 

resilient plate (55) connected with the holding web and 
the slide-like element a groove is formed which borders 

the outer edge section of a wall delimiting the guiding 
groove (44). 
Refrigerator according to any one of claims 10 through 
13, characterized in that the edge of the wall of the 

groove overlapped by the resilient plate (55) is 
provided with a recess the stepped ends of which form 

stops for the webs connected with the slide-like 
element.  

 
Refrigerator according to any one of the foregoing 
claims 11-14, characterized in that the slide-like 

element with the resilient connecting parts and 
engagement projections and with the resilient 

push-button formed by the plate are made of a one-piece 
injection-moulded plastics part.
