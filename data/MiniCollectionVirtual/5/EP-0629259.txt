<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device in rock drilling according to which a casing (1) provided with a rigid front end portion (2) is lowered concurrently with the drilling in order to seal said casing front end portion from the wall of the drilled hole. In accordance with the invention annular members (5) are inserted into one or several external peripheral grooves formed in the casing end portion (2), said annular members consisting of a material which with delay expand when moistened. Owing to this arrangement, the casing (1) may be lowered simultaneously with the drilling while encountering a minimum of resistance while at the same time a sealing means is provided which is well protected during the drilling operation but after the drilling seals the casing efficiently from the surrounding drill hole wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a method and a device 
in rock drilling wherein a casing provided with a rigid 
front end portion is lowered concurrently with the 
drilling to seal said casing front end portion from the 
wall of the drilled hole. In drilling wells, for example water wells or energy 
wells, it is often very important that surface water and 
pollutants do not stream into the drill hole. In order to 
prevent this from happening, it is common practice to 
force a casing through the earth stratum and through the 
uppermost rock strata, which often are cracked and 
consequently constitute possible risks that surface water 
and pollutants entrained therein penetrate into the drill 
hole. In accordance with one prior-art method the casing 
may be pulled down through the drill hole concurrently 
with the very drilling thereof. One type of such 
simultaneous drilling and pulling down of the casing is 
the method known as the ODEX Method. According to this, 
the casing which could be made from e.g. a plastics 
material, is fitted at its lower end with an end sleeve of 
metal or some other heavier material. The end sleeve may 
be attached to the casing by means of rivets or screws 
when the casing is made of plastics. If the casing is made 
of metal, the end sleeve could also be attached thereto by 
means of welding. In accordance with the prior-art method, 
the end sleeve is formed at its top with a shoulder 
projecting beyond the inner wall of the casing against 
which abuts a portion of a drill tool rotating inside the 
casing interior. A central drill bit as well as a so 
called reamer project below the lower end of the end 
slevee, and upon rotation of the drill in one direction 
the reamer is forced to expand in the radial direction in 
such a manner that it becomes possible to perform drilling 
operations below the end sleeve for reaming a drill hole  
 
the diameter of which exceeds that of the casing. Because 
of the abutment of the drill body against the end sleeve 
shoulder the casing is pulled downwards simultaneously 
with the drilling at the pace of the drilling operations. 
When the casing reaches the desired depth, the drill tool 
is rotated in the opposite direction, whereby the reamer 
is retracted in the radial direction in such a manner that 
the drill tool together with the drill bit may be pulled 
upwards in the interior of the casing. When drilling in this manner, water and drill 
cuttings are fed upwards, mainly in the interior of the 
casing, but material loosened from the

<CLAIMS>
A sealing method in rock drilling according 
to which a casing (1) provided with a rigid front end 

portion (2) is lowered into the drill hole simultaneously 
with the drilling, to seal said casing front end from 

the wall (4) of the drilled hole, 
characterized
 
in that annular members (5) of a material that 

expands with delay when moistened are lodged in one or 
several external peripheral grooves formed in said end 

portion (2) of the casing. 
A sealing method as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the expandable material 
is coated with a delay layer which dissolves slowly upon 

its contact with liquid. 
A sealing method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the composition of the 
expandable material is chosen to ensure that the expansion 

time for bridging the gap (a) between the casing (1, 2) 
and the surrounding drill hole wall (4) exceeds the time 

required for the drilling and/or the driving down of the 
casing to the desired depth. 
A sealing method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the 
peripheral grooves (3) formed in the end portion (2) of 

the casing are formed with the groove walls extending 
obliquely upwards, towards the drill hole wall (4). 
A sealing device for use in rock drilling of the 
kind wherein a casing (1) provided with a rigid front end 

portion (2) is lowered concurrently with the drilling, to 
effect sealing between said casing and the surrounding 

drill hole wall (4), 
characterized
 in that it 
comprises a casing end portion (2) having external 

peripheral grooves (3) formed therein and annular members 
(5) in said grooves (3), said annular members inserted 

into said grooves in advance or in connection with the 
lowering of the casing into the drill hole and said 

annular members (5) being of a material that expands when  
 

moistened, the outer diameter of said annular members (5) 
in said peripheral grooves having an external diameter in 

their non-moistened condition which with a clearance is 
smaller than the drill hole wall positioned exteriorly 

thereof. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that the lateral walls of the peripheral 

grooves (3) are oblique so as to incline upwards towards 
the wall of the drill hole (4) when the casing is in its 

driven-down condition. 
A device as claimed in claim 5 or 6, 
characterized
 
in that the annular members (5) 

inserted in the grooves (3) have an external diameter size 
when in their non-expanded condition which is smaller than 

the external diameter of the casing portion (2) in which 
they are housed. 
A device as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the annular members (5) consist of 

a chloroprene material. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 5-8, 

characterized
 in that the annular members (5) 
have a core of an exandable material which is coated by an 

external delay layer which is dissolved slowly by liquid 
in order to delay contact between the liquid and the 

expandable material and thus to delay the expansion effect 
thereof. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 5-7, 

characterized
 in that the grooved casing 
portion (2) is a separate sleeve which may be attached to 

the rest of the casing.
