<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus that produces digitally generated 
index prints and normal optical prints as part of 

the normal printing operation, without requiring 
the negatives (26) to be cut and handled separately. 

The foregoing is accomplished by using the 
exposure determination and subject classification (18) 

data generated for the normal optical printing 
operation to rapidly provide the low resolution 

digital data for creating the individual index 
print images, during the normal optical printing 

operation. While the digital images are being 
created, each digital image is being 

simultaneously corrected for its own exposure 
requirement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the
field of photofinishing and particularly to a
system for producing photographic prints and
currently producing digital index print.Most photographs are produced by:
exposing a film to light; developing the film to
produce a negative; and processing (printing) the
negative to produce a photographic print. The
dark areas in the negative allow little light to
pass so that the tones in the print appear light
as they did in the original scene. Also the
negatives from most color films have an overall
orange color, and are smaller than the print.
Thus, even when the negatives and prints for one
or more processed rolls of film are together, it
is difficult for an amateur photographer who is
not trained to view photographic negatives to
determine the negative that was used to produce a
specific print.An amateur photographer may receive the
negatives and prints for one or more rolls of
processed film in an envelope having two
compartments. The negatives are usually placed in
one compartment and the prints are usually placed
in the other compartment. Some of the prints may
be: given away; placed in a photo album; framed;
or become separated from the negatives. The
envelopes maybe haphazardly thrown in a box and
mixed with other envelopes in the box. Thus, when
someone wants to order reprints or enlargements of
one or more prints it may be difficult to locate
the negatives that correspond to the prints that
they want to order.When the prints and negatives are 
packaged together in an envelope, the negatives
are susceptible to scratching and contamination
from dust, dirt and/or fingerprints because the
envelope does not provide a damage-free
environment for the negatives. The various forms
of negative damage mentioned above will reduce the
quality of the reprints and enlargements that are
made from the negatives.Sometimes an amateur photographer or the
photofinisher places the negatives in wax or
plastic sleeves to protect and store the negatives
and accidentally damages the negatives as they are
inserted into the sleeves. This provides
protection for the negatives but does not provide
for easy identification of the negatives. In the
past contact prints have been made to provide a
convenient way to identify negatives by providing
a page of positive images that have the same size
on the contact print as the negative images on the
film. This is done by cutting a length of
negatives into individual strips. The strips are
then arranged on a sheet of photographic paper or
placed in

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for exposing digital images
and optical images on the same web of photosensitive

media (27), said apparatus characterized by:

means (15,19,40) for scanning photographic
images (9), that appear on a photographic media (26),

to create a digital representation of the photographic
images;
means (18) coupled to said scanning means for
optically exposing, via a first printing path

(14,16,17,18,20) with a lens (17) and light source
(16) controlled by said scanning means, the

photographic images scanned by said scanning means on
the web of the photosensitive media; and
means (30,31,32) coupled to said scanning
means for exposing a digital image via a second

printing path (21,33,34), completely separate from
said first printing path, on the web of photosensitive

media by utilizing the digital representation of the
pho
tographic images.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1, wherein
said scanning means (15,19,40) comprises: a scanner

(15,40) having a resolution that is matched to the
output resolution of said exposing means (30,31,32) so

that the individual digital images exposed on the web
(27) will have the same resolution on the web as the

individual digital representations of the photographic
images.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1,
wherein said scanning means comprises:


a scanner having a resolution that is lower
than the output resolution of said exposing means; and
digital resizing means (30,31) coupled to the
output of said scanner for matching the output

resolution of said scanner to the output resolution of
said digital exposing means.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1,
wherein said scanning means comprises:


a in line linear array (41,42,43);
means (13;48,55,56) coupled to said array and
said photographic media for moving said photographic

media passed said linear array; and
an independent light source (50) coupled to
said array.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1,
wherein said scanning means comprises:


a in line linear array;
means coupled to said array and said
photographic media for moving said linear array passed

said photographic media; and
an independent light source coupled to said
array.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1, wherein
said scanning means (15,19,40) comprises:


a color area array (51); and
a independent light source (50) coupled to
said array.
The apparatus claimed in claim 1, wherein
said scanning means (15,19,40) comprises:


a area array scanner (51,52) that is
positioned off the axis of said light source (16).
The apparatus claimed in claim 1,
wherein said scanning (15,19,40) means comprises:


a area array scanner (51,52) that is
positioned off the axis of said light source (16); and
a mirror (53) that has a first position (B)
which is located out of the axis of said light source

and a second position (A) which is located in the axis
of said light source so that the photographic images

on said photographic media is projected onto said area
array.
