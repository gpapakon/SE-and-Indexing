<ABSTRACT>
In the motorised setting device for machine axles, a motor (4) for the respective axle (2) to be set in a setting unit (1) is connected via a corresponding gearbox (3) directly to the axle (2) to be set and to a distance transmitter (5), for example a potentiometer. Both the feeding of the motor (4) and the signals from the distance transmitter (5) are connected to an operating unit (14) via an addressable node (7) by means of a bus (9). The operating unit (14) carries out control supervisory functions such as distance limitation, switching off in the case of overload, and determination of desired value deviations. In the operating unit (14), for each axle (2), the setting range, the scale and the scale unit can be determined and stored. A plurality of operating units, of which each is assigned to one of a plurality of machines, can be connected to a central control (15) via an interface (16). Using this setting device for machine axles, it is possible in a simple way to provide the mechanical components in a universal manner with electronic properties, which they do not have intrinsically or have intrinsically only at great cost.
