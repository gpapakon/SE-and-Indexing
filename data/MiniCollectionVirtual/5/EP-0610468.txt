<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of crystalline 
silicate molecular sieves. More particularly, the crystalline silicates are prepared from 
reaction formulations that use zeolitic aluminosilicates having sodalite substructures and has 
a tetrahedra atom density of less than about 15 TO2 per 1000 Å3 as the aluminum and silica 
source. Natural and synthetic zeolitic materials have demonstrated catalytic properties for use in 
various types of hydrocarbon processes. By using X-ray diffraction, certain zeolitic 
materials have been shown to have a crystalline structure wherein there are a large number 
of smaller cavities These smaller cavities may be interconnected by a number of still 
smaller channels or pores. Variations in pore dimensions and shapes have been found to 
effect the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the zeolites. Only molecules of certain 
dimensions and shapes are able to fit into the pores of a particular zeolite while molecules 
of a larger dimension or of a different shape are unable to enter the pore in the zeolite 
crystals. Since the pores in the zeolite accept molecules of certain dimensions while 
rejecting those of a larger dimension, these zeolites have come to be known as "molecular 
sieves" and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. These 
cavities and pores have been demonstrated to be of a uniform size within a specific zeolite.  
 
Because of their unique molecular sieving characteristics, as well as their potentially acidic 
nature, zeolites are especially useful in hydrocarbon processing as adsorbents and as 
catalysts for cracking, reforming, and other hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive 
ion-containing crystalline aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a 
rigged three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 in which the tetrahedra are 
cross-linked through the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum 
and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing 
aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example by the 
inclusion of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed by the 
relationship of aluminum to the cations, wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of 
various cations, such as Ca/2, Sr/2, Na, K, Cs or Li, is equal to unity. One cation may be 
exchanged either
