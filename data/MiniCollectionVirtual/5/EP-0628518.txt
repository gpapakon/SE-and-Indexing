<ABSTRACT>
A process of inhibiting oxalate scale formation in aqueous 
systems is disclosed. A preferred class of scale inhibitors 

is represented by polyamino hexamethylene phosphonates. 
These phosphonate inhibitors can be used in levels of from 

0.05 ppm to 300 ppm (of the aqueous solution) at pH in the 
near neutral to preferably alkaline medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of inhibiting scale
formation and deposition, and more particularly to a method
of inhibiting the formation of scale in aqueous systems which
are primarily alkaline and contain oxalates.Deposits of sparingly soluble calcium oxalate occur in
industries and processes such as paper manufacture
(especially in the pulping process), sugar beet processing,
sugar clarification and whisky distillation.Paper making processes are a major industry sector
suffering from oxalate scaling because large volumes of water
rich in calcium are used and because the wood, i;e. the basic
raw material, is a natural source of oxalic acid (see
"Handbook of Industrial Water Conditioning", sixth edition,
third printing, Betz Laboratories Inc., Trevose,
Pennsylvania 19047, USA). The recirculation of process
waters increases the concentration of oxalate and enhances
further the tendency towards precipitation.The undesirable effects of the deposition of oxalate
scale are well documented in the literature-see J.A.Glazer-"Overview
of Deposit Control", Tappi J., page 72 July 1991.Compounds which act as scale inhibitors, or mixtures of
such compounds, do so by inhibiting the growth of crystals,
thereby effecting a reduction in the formation of scale.
Crystalline deposits can be effectively controlled by
introducing an appropriate impurity into the crystal lattice.
Such an impurity prevents further growth of the crystal and
reduces or eliminates the scale formation. Phosphonates,
polyphosphates and polymeric electrolytes are typically used
for this purpose. USP 4575425 describes a scale inhibiting formulation
comprising water soluble phosphate, phosphonate or
phosphinate and a water soluble polyelectrolyte.USP 4804476 describes a scale inhibiting mixture
comprising water soluble phosphates and polycarboxylates to
inhibit the deposition of calcium oxalate in paper mills.GB 2248830 and EP-A-0479462 describe methods useful in
the oil industry for inhibiting the formation of scale in
water having a high barium content and a low pH comprising
the addition of an aqueous solution of defined
polyaminomethylene phosphonates to the water to be treated.Other substances used as typical scale inhibitors
include sulphonated ethoxylated hydrocarbons, polyacrylates,
and organic polyphosphonic acids. The "other" scale
inhibitors are chemically different from the phosphonate
compounds in accordance with Claim 1 and can be represented
by all compounds which are known to exhibit scale inhibiting
and/or dispersing
