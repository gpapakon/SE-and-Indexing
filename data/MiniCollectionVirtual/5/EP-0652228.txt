<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel ureas and 
urethanes of Formula I: 


which stimulate cytokine production and may be used to 
accelerate recovery from neutropenia accompanying 

radio- or chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, or 
infections. Compounds in the invention or 

pharmaceutical compositions employing these compounds 
may be useful in the treatment of cancer, AIDS, 

aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and infectious 
diseases, and in the enhancement of immune response.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cytokines such as G-CSF, M-CSF, GM-CSF (colony 
stimulating factors) and IL-1, IL-3, IL-6 
(interleukins) can stimulate hematopoiesis in diseases 
associated with bone marrow failure and thus accelerate 
recovery from neutropenia as reported by Metcalf, D., 
Science, 529, (1991) and H. G. Klingemann and H. J. 
Deeg, CIPS, 14, 243, (1989) as well as G. Mortsyn and 
A. W. Burgess, Cancer Research 48, 5624, (1988). 
Portions of the natural bacterial cell wall and synthetic 
lipopeptides that mimic the cell wall have been 
reported to have immunostimulant properties as described 
by J. Freund, Adv. Tubercl. Res., 1, 130 
(1956); F. Ellouz, A. Adam, R. Ciorbaru and E. Lederer, 
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 59, 1317, (1974); V. 
St. Georgiev, Medicinal Res. Rev, 11, 81, (1991) and I. 
Azuma, Int. J. Immunopharmac., 14, 487 (1992). More 
specifically, certain compounds have been identified 
which appear to induce the formation of CSF and can aid 
in bone marrow restoration after myelosuppression 
caused by chemotherapy or radiation. These include compounds 
such as pimelautide (RP-40639), [as reported by 
F. Floch'h, J. Bouchaudon, C. Fizames, A. Zerial, G. 
Dutruc-Rosset and G.H. Werner, CIPS, 763 (1984) and in 
Patent No. FR-2,482,961, (1981)]; muroctasin (Daiichi 
Seiyaku Co.) [as reported by I. Azuma, Int. J.  
 
Immunopharmac., 14, 487 (1992); R. Nakajima, Y. Yshida, 
K. Akahane, M. Sekiguchi and Y. Osada, 
Arzneim.-Forsch., 41, 60, (1991); Scrip, 22, 1655 
(1991); and Patent No. EP-135,788, (1985)]; and FK-156 
and FK-565 (Fujisawa) [as reported by S. Izumi, K. 
Nakahara, T. Gotoh, S. Hashimoto, T. Kino, M. Okuhara, 
H. Aoki, and H. Imanaka, J. Antibiotics, 566, (1983); 
K. Nakamura, K. Nakahara, H. Aoki, Agric. Biol. Chem., 
48, 2579 (1984); H. Keiji, H. Takeno, S. Okada, O. 
Nakguchi, Y. Kitaura, and M. Hashimoto, Tetrahedron 
Lett., 23, 693 (1982) and U.S. Patents No., 4,349,466 
and 4,666,890]. U.S. Patent 4,666,890 discloses a synthetic 
tripeptide which has been reported to have activity as 
an immunomodulator, for use as an antitumor agent 
rather than as an adjuvant to chemotherapy. The 
reported cell-wall components and their synthetic 
analogs are all peptides incorporating a D-glutamic 
acid (D-Glu) moiety Î³-linked to either lysine (Lys) or 
diaminopi- melic acid (A2pm), with additional peptide 
bonds or fatty acyl groups flanking the two ends. The novel urethanes and ureas disclosed in 
this invention are the first examples of non-peptide 
analogs of bacterial cell wall components and lack
