<ABSTRACT>
The current feeder module (3) for the supply of a low-critical-temperature superconducting electrical load is placed in a cryostat (1), is fixed to its closure lid (2) and comprises a pair of metallic conductors (6, 7) passing through the lid (2) and connected at their lower end to the upper end of a high-critical-temperature superconducting module (8) comprising two conductors (9, 10) which are electrically connected to the said pair of metallic conductors (6, 7) and are separated by an insulating core (11) forming a mechanical reinforcement, an insulating structure (14), fixed by its upper end (15), under the said lid (2) of the cryostat (1), surrounding in a sealed manner the pair of metallic conductors (6, 7) as far as its junction (16) with the superconducting module (8), the structure (14) extending, in a non-sealed manner, as far as at least the lower end of the superconducting module (8), the structure (14) including, at its lower end, fixing means (20) for supporting the electrical load (4).
