<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for recovering arsenic 
acid from a starting mixture comprising sulfuric and arsenic acids and 

water. In step (a), the starting mixture is treated with a sulfur (IV) 
compound which will reduce the arsenic acid to arsenic (III) compound 

under conditions sufficient to substantially convert the arsenic acid to 
arsenic (III) wherein the resulting mixture comprises arsenic (III) 

compound, the sulfur (IV) compound, sulfuric acid, and water. In step 
(b), the resulting mixture is purged with inert gas to substantially 

remove the sulfur (IV) compound from the mixture wherein the purged 
mixture comprises the arsenic (III) compounds, sulfuric acid, and 

water. In step (c), the purged mixture is treated under conditions 
sufficient to substantially separate the arsenic (III) compounds from 

the purged mixture. In step (d), the separated arsenic (III) compound 
is reacted with an oxidizing agent to substantially convert arsenic (III) 

compound to arsenic acid wherein the final mixture comprises arsenic 
acid, unreacted oxidizing agent, and water. In step (e), impurities are 

removed from the final mixture to provide substantially pure aqueous 
arsenic acid. 
The recovered arsenic acid may be used for example as a raw 
material for the production of CCA wood preservative. The purged 

mixture which is sulfuric acid may be reused for example in the 
process of commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,089,241.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the separation of
aqueous mixtures of arsenic acid or salts thereof from a waste mixture
comprising sulfuric and arsenic acids and producing a high purity
arsenic acid product.Commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,089,241 describes a process
for the conversion of hazardous hexafluoroarsenic acid or any salt
thereof to arsenic acid. The resulting hazardous mixture comprises
about 45 to about 85 weight percent sulfuric acid, about 5 to about
25 weight percent arsenic acid, and about 15 to about 40 weight
percent water. The patent teaches that this hazardous waste may be
rendered non-hazardous by the use of known methods.Rather than generate waste for storage in a landfill, a process is
needed which separates the arsenic acid from the waste mixture such
that the separated arsenic acid may be reused. A process which also
separates the sulfuric acid such that the separated sulfuric acid also
could be reused would be extremely advantageous.Attempts have been made to solve this problem of separating
the arsenic acid or salts thereof from sulfuric acid in various media but
the following problems have been encountered. L. Nan et al.,
"Kinetics of Reduction of Arsenic (V) to Arsenic (III) with Sulfur
Dioxide in Aqueous Solution", Australas. Inst. Min. Metall. Publ. Ser.
1989, 6/89 (Non-ferrous Smelting Symp., 1989, 145-52) report that 
the reduction of arsenic acid to arsenious acid with sulfur dioxide in
aqueous solution proceeds in two steps: the absorption of the sulfur
dioxide from the gas phase into the aqueous phase and the reduction
of the arsenic acid. Sulfuric acid was initially added to the arsenic
acid to adjust pH. The weight percent of arsenic acid used was 1 to
14 while the weight percent of sulfuric acid used was 0.5 to 30.
Most of the experiments were conducted with 0.01 M or 0.1 M initial
arsenic acid and a small amount of sulfuric acid added to adjust the
pH to about 4. The reference reports that when the initial arsenic acid
was then increased to 1 M, the arsenic reduction rate decreased by
about 30 percent. The reference teaches that the reaction rate was
considerably reduced in concentrated sulfuric acid solutions. Thus,
the reference discourages the use of a starting material having higher
concentrations of sulfuric and arsenic acids therein. Further, the
reference teaches that the arsenious acid is the final product and not
further reacted. See also K. Gritton et al., "Metal Recovery from
Metallurgical Wastes", Society for Mining, Metallurgy and

(a) treating said starting mixture comprising at least 1 weight
percent of arsenic acid, at least 1 weight percent of sulfuric acid and up
