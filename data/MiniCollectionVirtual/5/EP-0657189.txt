<ABSTRACT>
A method of decomposing halogenated aromatic compounds safely without fail, which comprises bringing 
a solution of a halogenated aromatic compound in a hot-alkali-resistant polar solvent into contact with an alkaline 

substance at about 100 to about 300°C to decompose the aromatic compound and removing the salt and alkaline 

substance precipitated in the solvent to recycle the used solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safe method of 
decomposing halogenated aromatic compounds such as 
polychlorinated biphenyl (hereinafter "PCB" ), using 
chemical reaction of halogenated aromatic compounds in a 
polar solvent. It is known that it is extremely difficult to treat 
PCB or other such halogenated aromatic compound. This has 
led to considerable efforts directed toward the removal or 
decomposition of halogenated aromatic compounds. Methods 
for accomplishing this using a reaction process that takes 
place in the presence of an alkali include the alumina-alkali 
process disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 2,951,804. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,532,028 discloses a method of reacting alkali 
and a PCB content of up to 50,000 ppm in a mixture of alkyl 
or alkylene sulfoxide and polyole, thereby reducing the 
content to several ppm. Other examples include Canadian 
Patent No. 408,116 which discloses a method employing 
melted sodium, and Italian Patent No. 22,215 which 
discloses a method using alkaline earth metal on which PEG  
 
is adsorbed. Each method has its good points. However, with the 
prior art techniques it is not possible to further remove 
halogenated aromatic compounds from samples having a low 
concentration thereof, so that the halogenated aromatic 
compound content is further reduced to the extent that the 
inclusion thereof is substantially not recognizable; it is 
not yet possible to reduce the halogenated aromatic 
compound concentration to 1 ppm or below. Moreover, it is 
widely known that heating the solvent used in the prior art 
methods to a high temperature of 120° C or over in the 
presence of an alkali or alkali metal has a chemically 
destablizing effect that promotes solvent decomposition and 
polymerization, degrading the basic function of the solvent. The inventor of the present invention investigated 
various ways of eliminating such drawbacks and discovered a 
highly effective method of decomposing halogenated aromatic 
compounds. In accordance with the method, a heat-resistant 
alkaline polar solvent that has a high boiling point and 
good high-temperature stability with respect to alkalis is 
selected, in which halogenated aromatic compounds are 
treated, using an alkali. Thus, in the method of the present invention for 
decomposing halogenated aromatic compounds, the non-halogenated-aromatic  
 
compounds are contacted with an alkali 
at a temperature ranging from about 100°C to about 300° 
C, and resultant solid materials contained in the heat-resistant 
alkaline polar
