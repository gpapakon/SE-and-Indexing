used in paint or the like exposed to solar radiation and 

methods of producing such titanium dioxide pigment are 
described. The durable titanium dioxide pigment comprises 

rutile titanium dioxide particles having cerium oxide and 
dense amorphous silica deposited thereon. The particles 

preferably also have an outer coating of hydrous alumina 
deposited thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved titanium dioxide
pigments and their production.Pigmentary titanium dioxide, particularly rutile
titanium dioxide, is utilized in a wide variety of products
in which a high degree of durability is required. For
example, rutile titanium dioxide pigments are commonly used
in paints, plastics, and paper laminates. However, when
such products are exposed to ultraviolet radiation,
degradation and discoloration of the pigment is
accelerated. Thus, there is a need for an improved
titanium dioxide pigment having a high durability whereby
the effective lives of products including the pigment are
extended.FR-1218185 relates to a method for preparing a rutile
pigment having good photochemical stability which comprises
slurrying a rutile pigment in water and treating the slurry
with a mixture of water-soluble silicate, an aluminium salt
and a cerium salt to produce a rutile pigment having a
mixed oxide coating.The present invention meets the need described above
and overcomes shortcomings of the prior art by providing
pigmentary titanium dioxide having an improved durability,
i.e., an improved resistance to photo chemical degradation.
The durable pigmentary titanium dioxide of this invention
is comprised of rutile titanium dioxide particles having 
thereon a deposit of cerium oxide and then a coating of
dense amorphous silica deposited thereon. The cerium oxide
is present on the titanium dioxide particles in an amount
in the range of from about 0.01% to about 1.0% by weight of
titanium dioxide and the dense amorphous silica is present
in an amount in the range of from about 1% to about 8% by
weight of titanium dioxide.The titanium dioxide particles having cerium oxide
and then dense amorphous silica deposited thereon also 
preferably include an outer coating of hydrous alumina
deposited thereon. The hydrous alumina is preferably
present on the particles in an amount in the range of
from about 2% to about 4% by weight of titanium
dioxide.The improved highly durable titanium dioxide
pigment of this invention is produced by forming an
aqueous slurry of rutile titanium dioxide particles and
adding a water soluble cerium compound thereto which,
on reaction with an acid or alkali, deposits cerium
oxide on the titanium dioxide particles. An acid or
alkali is added to the slurry to cause the deposit of
cerium oxide on the titanium dioxide particles. A
water soluble silicate and a mineral acid are next
added to the slurry to thereby deposit dense amorphous
silica on the titanium dioxide
