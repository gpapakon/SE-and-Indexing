<ABSTRACT>
Actuating means (8) for opening and closing a spring 
clamp terminal (7) mounted within a connector housing (4) 

is receivable within a cavity (24) of the housing (4). The 
actuating means (8) comprises a tapered first camming 

surface (38) for progressively biasing the spring clamp 
(7) open, and a second rest surface (40) for maintaining 

the spring clamp (7) open for reception of a wire (14) 
without requiring use of the tool (12). Once the wire has 

been placed in a wire receiving hole (56) of the spring 
clamp (7), the actuating means (8) can be released by 

tilting thereof about a pivot line (70) such that the 
spring arm (54) of the spring clamp (7) engages the first 

camming surface (38) hence pushing the actuating means 
outwardly of the cavity (24), thereby enabling clamping of 

the wire (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to actuating means for opening
an electrical wire spring clamp mounted in a connector
housing. In particular, the invention relates to an electrical connector having actuating means as well as to a method of electrically connecting a wire to terminals of a connector.It is well known in the electrical industry, to use
spring clamps for connecting electrical wires to an
electrical terminal. The spring clamps provide a rapid
connection and disconnection system for electrical wires
commonly used for example, in large rack and panel
connectors whereby the user can easily adapt the wiring to
his own needs. The housing and mounting system of such a
rack and panel connector could be similar to that
described in DE-A-4 410 073.It is known to have an insert receivable in a cavity
of a connector for opening a spring clamp by being
depressed, whereby a camming surface thereof resiliently
biases the spring clamp open for receiving a wire. The
problem with this system, is that the insert must be
depressed with a screw driver, for example, and be held
depressed to maintain the spring clamp open so that the
wire can be inserted, the operator thus needing both hands
for this operation. The screwdriver also gets in the way
and increases the difficulty of placing the wire in the
spring clamp hole. It would thus be desirable to provide
a spring clamp actuator that maintains the spring clamp in
a fully open wire receiving position without requiring any
external means therefor and that can be rapidly and simply
released such that the wire is clamped to the spring clamp
for electrical connection therewith.From document EP 0 052 767 A1 an electrical wire connector has
come to be known. This known connector comprises actuating means for
opening an electrical wire spring clamp. In a first version of this known
connector, the spring clamp is opened and maintained in an open position
by a movable ram made in a screw-like form. Another known
version uses a wedge for opening and blocking the spring clamp.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide a cost effective and reliable electrical connector having a spring clamp
actuator that can be easily manipulated for opening and
closing of the spring clamp as well as a related method for electrically connecting a wire to terminals of a connector.It is also an object of this invention to provide an  
electrical connector having an
actuator that can maintain the spring clamp open without
requiring external means therefor. These objects are solved according

<CLAIMS>
Electrical connector, comprising a housing (4), a
spring clamp (7) mounted in the housing (4), the housing

(4) comprising a cavity (24) receiving an actuating means
(8) adjacent the spring clamp (7) for connecting or

disconnecting an electrical wire (14) to the spring clamp
(7), characterized in that the actuating means (8) is

slidably received in the cavity (24) and comprises camming
means (36) engageable against the spring clamp (7), having

a first surface (38) for progressively biasing the spring
clamp (7) open by depressing the actuating means (8)

further in the cavity (24) with exterior means (12), and
having a second surface (40) adjacent the first surface

(38) for maintaining the spring clamp (7) fully open for
receiving the wire (14) without requiring the exterior

means (12) whereby the spring clamp (7) presses against the
second surface (40) and biases the actuating means (8)

against a side wall (62) of the cavity (24) thereby
maintaining the actuating means (8) in the fully open

position, the actuating means (8) pivotable whilst in the
fully open position such that the spring clamp (7)

reengages the first surface (38) and presses the actuating
means (8) outwardly of the cavity (24) thereby enabling the

spring clamp (7) to clamp the wire (14).
The electrical connector of claim 1 characterized
in that the actuating means (8) is comprised of a single

moulded part.
The electrical connector of claims 1 or 2
characterized in that the actuating means (8) has an indent

(46) for positioning the exterior means (12). 
The electrical connector of any preceding claim
characterized in that the actuating means (8) comprises a

lower back surface (42), adjacent thereto an upper slanted
back surface (44) and a pivot line (70) defined by the

intersection therebetween; the lower back wall (42)
substantially parallel to the second camming surface (40)

and biased against the side wall (62) of the connector
housing (4) when the actuating means (8) is in the fully

open position, whereby the actuating means (8) is pivotable
about the pivot line (70) such that the slanted upper

surface (44) rotates towards the connector side wall (62)
and the first camming surface (38) engages with the spring

clamp (7).
A method of electrically connecting a wire (14) to
terminals (6) of a connector (2), characterized by the

steps of:

a) providing a connector assembly comprising a
connector housing (4), terminals (6) mounted therein

attached to spring clamp connection means (7), actuating
means (8) mounted longitudinally slidable along a cavity

(24) in the connector housing (4) proximate the spring
clamp (7), the actuating means (8) being adapted to be

pressed against a wall (62) of the cavity (24) by the
spring clamp (7) in its opened position and having a pivot

line (70) cooperating with the cavity wall (62) upon
actuation of the actuating means (8) whereupon the

actuating means (8) is biased outwardly of the cavity (24)
by the spring clamp (7);
b) depressing the actuating means (8) with exterior
means (12) until a fully inserted position;
c) removing the exterior means (12) and inserting the
wire (14) in the spring clamp (7);
d) pivoting the actuating means (8) with exterior
means (12) such that the spring clamp (7) is released and 

thereby the wire (14) is clamped to the terminal (6) for
electrical connection therewith.
The method of claim 5 characterized by providing
the actuating means (8) of any one of claims 1 to 4.
