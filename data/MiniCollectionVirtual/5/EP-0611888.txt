<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum pump having a housing which contains two pump chambers I, II whose volume is varied by means of a displaceable piston (plunger) 2. The two pump chambers I, II are configured in terms of fluid dynamics in such a way that the gas to be conveyed is compressed in two stages. The ratio of chamber volume to clearance volume is designed in such a way that an absolute pressure of 
<
 600 Pa is reached. The piston 2 can be displaced by means of a piston rod 3 which is guided through one chamber.

Vacuum pump with a housing which comprises two pump chambers 
(I, II), the volume of which is altered by means of a displaceable 

piston (2), wherein the piston (2) is displaceable by means of a 
piston rod (3) which is passed through a chamber, the inlet and the 

outlet of the pump and the piston (2) each comprise a valve, and 
pneumatically the two pump chambers (I, II) are designed so that the 

gas to be conveyed is compressed in two stages, characterised in 
that the ratio of chamber volume to dead volume is selected so that 

an absolute pressure of 
<
 600 Pa is achieved and in that the piston 
(2) is freely movable essentially in the entire chamber volume of 

both pump chambers (I, II) so that the dead volumes of the two pump 
chambers (I, II) are minimised. 
Vacuum pump according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
chamber through which the piston rod (3) is passed is the first 

chamber (I) into which the gas to be conveyed is sucked into the 
pump. 
Vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that both the inlet and the outlet of the pump 

comprise non-return valves (12, 13). 
Vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the inlet opening is provided with a fine 

filter (15). 
Vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the piston (2) comprises an O-ring valve (8) 

which is disposed in the connecting opening from the first to the 
second chamber. 
Vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the piston rod (3) is operated by foot. 
Vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that it is mainly made of plastic parts. 
Use of a vacuum pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the pump is used to evacuate a sorption system  

 
in which water is made to evaporate in the vacuum and in which the 

vacuum pump extracts air and gases which have not been sorbed.
