<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a radar system (10) that provides for near 
range detection of targets for use with frequency modulation 

continuous wave and stepped frequency waveforms. The system 
(10) comprises transceiver means (11, 13) for transmitting

signals from the target. Signal processing means (12) are 

provided for determining (32) a coherent average of the received 
reference ramp return signals and for subtracting (33) the 

coherent average of the transmitted reference ramp signals from 
each signal in a group of succeeding reference ramp return 

signals. Said signal processing means (12) comprise means (36) 
for non-conherently integrating the resulting group of reference 

ramp return signals to provide for detection of nearby targets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radar systems, and more particularly, 
to a system and method for near range microwave detection for use with frequency-modulation 
continuous-wave (FMCW) and stepped frequency radar systems. Several partial solutions exist for the well-known near-range FMCW detection 
problem These include physically separating the transmit and receive antennas to 
improve isolation, cancellation of leakage by analog hardware methods, minimizing 
internal reflections within the system, and increasing FM ramp bandwidth. Having 
physically distinct transmit and receive antennas increases hardware complexity, size 
and cost, as does hardware cancellation. Hardware cancellation and minimization of 
internal reflections are unattractive for mass-production. These techniques are available 
but can not be implemented in an automotive product because of cost, size and the 
difficulties of mass production. Increasing FM ramp bandwidth is often precluded by 
FCC regulations or may require operation in an alternative frequency band where 
microwave components are less producible. Consequently, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for a system 
and method based on waveform design and digital signal processing that provides for 
detection of near-range targets using a frequency-modulation continuous-wave 
(FMCW) or stepped frequency radar and that overcomes the above-mentioned 
problems and limitations.  In order to meet the above and other objectives, the present invention employs a 
cancellation procedure embodied in a digital signal processor of a radar system that is 
used to detect near-range targets. It was previously assumed that it was not possible to 
detect targets in the "first range bin" formed by processing the return of an FMCW 
waveform. The present invention allows for detection of targets within this regime, 
thus permitting the use of a narrower bandwidth system for a given near obstacle range. The present system and method uses a frequency-modulation continuous-wave 
(FMCW) or stepped frequency waveform to detect targets that would normally be 
obscured by transmitter leakage and internal reflections. The cancellation procedure is 
implemented by transmitting one or more reference ramp signals and then subtracting 
the coherent average of the transmitted reference ramp signals from each signal in a 
group of succeeding transmitted and received ramp signals. The resulting group of FM 
ramp return signals is then noncoherently integrated to achieve more
