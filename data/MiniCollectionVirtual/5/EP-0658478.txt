<ABSTRACT>
A de-icer for attachment to an airfoil subject 
to impingement by an airstream. The airstream induces a 

stagnation line near the leading edge of the airfoil. 
The de-icer has inflatable passages that are parallel to 

the airstream overlying the airfoil on one side of the 
stagnation line, and inflatable passages that are 

parallel to the leading edge overlying the airfoil on 
the other side of the stagnation line. The de-icer 

maintains the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil 
during de-icer inflation. A method of manufacturing the 

de-icer is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aircraft de-icers
and more particularly to an improved inflatable de-icer
or boot adapted for attachment to the airfoil of an
aircraft for use in retarding the accumulation of ice or
to remove or break up ice accumulation.Aircraft inflatable de-icers, pads or boots
are made of resilient material such as rubber and
attached to the leading edge of an airfoil and extend
rearwardly therefrom. The de-icer has a series of
inflatable passages or tubes which are distended by
inflation pressure to break up ice accumulation which
tends to form on the surface of the de-icer. The
passages or tubes are deflated by releasing the pressure
medium and drawing a vacuum thereon. The normal
sequence of operation is a continuous cycling of the
inflation and deflation process. An example of a de-icer
in the art is presented in United States Patent
4,779,823 PNEUMATIC DE-ICER, Ely et al. This de-icer
incorporates a multitude of spanwise inflatable passages
on either side of a leading edge that run parallel to
the leading edge. A non-inflatable region overlies the
leading edge. The inflatable passages to one side of
the leading edge are cycled alternatively with the
inflatable passages to the other side of the leading
edge which generates a clamshell action that more
effectively removes ice by cracking the ice accumulation
along the leading edge. Another de-icer in the art is
presented in United States Patent 4,561,613 DEICER FOR
AIRCRAFT, Weisend, Jr. This de-icer incorporates a 
multitude of chordwise inflatable passages that are
parallel to the airstream that impinges upon the de-icer
and passes around the airfoil.
The preambles of claims 1 and 5 are based on this document.
In general, chordwise
tubes are less disruptive to the surrounding airstream
that passes over the airfoil than spanwise tubes during
inflation of the de-icer. Conversely, spanwise tubes
remove ice much better than chordwise tubes on many
airfoil geometries, particularly those geometries that
have small leading edge radiuses.Modern aircraft have flight surfaces that are
sensitive to perturbations in the airstream that passes
over the airfoil. Changes in an airfoil shape during
inflation of a de-icer can cause undesirable changes in
the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil.
Therefore, a de-icer is desired that effectively removes
ice without undesirably effecting aerodynamic
characteristics.It is an object of the invention to improve a de-icer
and a method of building a de-icer with inflatable passages
with different
