<ABSTRACT>
A valve device which is to be used in particular in the field of pneumatics is proposed, which valve device has at least one electrically actuable solenoid valve (5) which has a valve housing (12) in which a solenoid valve is arranged. The valve housing (12) has an outer face (15) which faces the surroundings and on which a plurality of cooling ribs (17) which are separated from one another by intermediate spaces (16) are provided at least in the region of the solenoid. In this way, operational impairments which are due to temperature are reduced.

Valve unit, in particular for pneumatics, with one or more 
electrically-actuable solenoid valves (5), with a valve housing 

(12) in which is mounted a solenoid coil (13), and with an outer 
surface (15) facing the outside and provided at least in the area 

of the solenoid coil (13) with several cooling ribs (17) 
separated from one another by intermediate spaces (16), wherein 

the intermediate spaces (16) between the cooling ribs (17) are 
open at the ends, characterized in that several solenoid valves 

(5) are provided adjacent to one another, with the valve housings 
(12) of adjacent solenoid valves (5) being provided with cooling 

ribs (17) on the sections (22) of the outer surface facing one 
another in such a way that cooling ribs (17) and intermediate 

spaces (16) lie opposite one another in pairs forming duct-like 
channels (23). 
Valve unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cooling ribs (17) and the intermediate spaces (16) extend 

linearly. 
Valve unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the cooling ribs (17) are a one-piece integral part of the valve 

housing (12). 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the valve housing (12) has slot-like recesses (32) on the 

outer surface (15), with the housing sections lying between 
adjacent recesses (32) forming the cooling ribs (17).  

 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that at least one ribbed area (36) with cooling ribs (17) is 

located next to at least one unribbed and in particular smooth 
area (34, 35) of the valve housing (12), with the long-side end 

faces (28) of the cooling ribs (17) of at least one ribbed area 
(36) and the surface of at least one adjacent unribbed area (34, 

35) lying at least essentially in a common plane (27). 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that all cooling ribs (17) of the valve housing (12) run 

parallel to one another. 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that one mounting side (7) of a particular solenoid valve (5) 

may be or is attached to the mounting surface (6) of a component 
(4), in particular one which it is to influence, in such a way 

that it extends from the mounting surface (6) along an extension 
axis (18), with the said component (4) expediently being a 

multiway valve or a fluid distributor, and with the cooling ribs 
(17) which contribute to the formation of the duct-like channels 

(23) running transversely or in particular at right-angles to the 
extension axis. 
Valve unit according to claim 7, characterized in that, in 
the case of a solenoid valve (5) mounted on a multiway valve (4), 

the extension axis runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
multiway valve (4). 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the valve housing (12) of any particular solenoid valve 

(5) has a feed side (25) at which the electrical control signals 
are supplied and at which an electrical coupler (14) is 

expediently provided, wherein two side faces parallel to one 
another, on each of which several of the cooling ribs (17) are 

provided, connect at the feed side (25), and wherein the other 
surface areas of the valve housing (12) may be designed without 

ribs.  
 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the solenoid valve (5) contains two or more solenoid 

coils (13). 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that there is provided a fluid distributor which directly or 

indirectly carries a battery-like arrangement of several solenoid 
valves (5) equipped with cooling ribs (17), wherein the solenoid 

valves (5) if directly attached are in particular attached to 
multiway valves (4) which in turn rest on the fluid distributor 

(2). 
Valve unit according to any of claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that the valve housing (12) of the solenoid valve (5) has a 

feed side (25) at which the electrical signals are supplied via 
a connection element (37) attachable in particular releasably, 

with the connection element having slot-like recesses (38) 
arranged in the axial extension of the intermediate spaces (16) 

of the valve housing (12) provided between the cooling ribs (17).
