<ABSTRACT>
Digital compressed codes, associated with advertisements enable a user to selectively record additional information, which would be broadcast on a television channel at a later time. The advertisement could be print advertisement or broadcast advertisement on television or radio. The user enters the digital code (I code) (652) associated with an advertisement into a unit with a decoding means (14) which automatically converts the code into CTL (Channel, time and length). The unit within a twenty-four-hour-period activates a VCR (14) to record information on the television channel (18) at the right time for the proper length of time. The decoded channel, time and length information can be communicated directly to a VCR (14), and used by the VCR (14) directly to automatically activate the VCR (14) to record a given television information broadcast corresponding to the communicated channel, time and length. Alternately, the channel, time and length information can be decoded directly in a remote control unit (80) and only start record, stop record and channel selection commands (16) sent to the VCR (14) at the appropriate times. Algorithms for decoding the I codes (652) can be a function of time to ensure security of the decoding method. A method is included for use of the I codes (652) with cable channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to video
cassette recorder systems and particularly to the timer
preprogramming feature of video cassette records (VCRs)
and to an apparatus and method for using encoded
information to shorten the time required to perform timer
preprogramming and also an apparatus and method for
enabling a user to selectively record, for later viewing,
detailed information that is associated with an earlier
publication or broadcast of an advertisement.The video cassette recorder (VCR) has a number
of uses, including playing back of tapes filmed by a video
camera, playing back of pre-recorded tapes, and recording
and playing back of broadcast and cable television
programs.To record a television program in advance of
viewing it, a two-step process is often used: (1) obtain
the correct channel, date, time and length (CDTL)
information from a television program guide, and (2)
program this CDTL information into the VCR. Depending on
the model, year and type of the VCR, the CDTL information
can be programmed in various ways including: (i) pushing
an appropriate sequence of keys in the console according
to instructions contained in the user's manual, (ii)
pushing an appropriate sequence of keys in a remote hand-held
control unit according to 
instructions contained in the user's manual (remote programming), and (iii) executing
a series of keystrokes in the remote hand-held control unit in response to a menu
displayed on the television screen (on-screen programming). Other techniques for
timer preprogramming have been suggested including: (iv) reading in certain bar-code
information using a light pen (light pen programming), and (v) entering instructions
through a computer or telephone modem. These various methods differ only in the
physical means of specifying the information while the contents, being CDTL and
certain power/clock/timer on-off commands are generally common although the
detailed protocol can vary with different model VCRs. Methods (i) and (ii) described
above can require up to 100 keystrokes, which has inhibited the free use of the timer
preprogramming feature of VCRs. To alleviate this, new VCR models have included
an "On-Screen Programming" feature, which permits remote input of CDTL
information in response to a menu displayed on the television screen. Generally on
screen programming of CDTL information requires an average of about 18 keystrokes,
which is less than some of the prior methods but still rather substantial. Some of the
other techniques such as (iv) above,
