<ABSTRACT>
The invention aims at improving the cooling in the upper 
part of a fuel assembly of a boiling water reactor during 

operation, thus reducing the risk of dryout. In a boiling 
water reactor, coolant flows upwardly through the fuel assembly 

and thereby changes from a single-phase state to a 
two-phase state. A fuel assembly comprises a top tie plate 

(3), bottom tie plate (4), a number of fuel rods (1) arranged 
in a bundle therebetween, and a number of spacers (2) 

to retain the bundle. The fuel assembly is divided in its 
axial direction into a plurality of fictitious first sub-lengths 

(L1) which correspond to the distance between two 
spacers arranged one after the other in the lower part of 

the fuel assembly. Two first sub-lengths adjoining each 
other constitute a second sub-length (L1+L1). In at least 

one second sub-length, which at least for the most part is 
located in the upper part of the fuel assembly, two spacers 

(S22,S23) are arranged in such a way that they divide said 
second sub-length into three essentially equally long third 

sub-lengths (L2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fuel assembly for reducing the 
risk of dryout in a boiling water nuclear reactor (BWR) according 
to the precharacterising part of claim 1. A reactor core comprises fuel rods kept together into bundles 
in fuel assemblies. During operation, the fuel rods are 
cooled by water. To retain and fix the fuel rods in the fuel 
assembly, spacers are used. A fuel assembly in a nuclear boiling water reactor consists 
of an elongated tubular container, often with a rectangular 
or square cross section, which is open at both ends so as to 
form a continuous flow passage, through which the cooling 
water of the reactor may flow. The fuel assembly comprises a 
large number of equally elongated tubular fuel rods, arranged 
in parallel in a certain definite, normally symmetrical, 
pattern. At the top the fuel rods are retained by a top 
tie plate and at the bottom by a bottom tie plate. To allow 
coolant to flow past the fuel rods in the desired manner, it 
is important that they be spaced from each other and prevented 
from bending or vibrating when the reactor is in operation.  
 
For this purpose, a plurality of spacers are used, 
distributed along the fuel assembly in the longitudinal direction. Since the cooling water in a boiling water reactor boils, a 
ratio of water to steam is formed which varies axially in 
the core. The cooling water flows from the bottom and upwardly 
in the core. At the bottom of the core, the temperature 
of the cooling water is lower than its boiling temperature 
and is thus entirely in liquid phase. Further up, where 
the coolant reaches the boiling temperature, part of the water 
is transferred into steam and the coolant is in two 
phases. The further up in the core, the higher the ratio of 
steam to water. In the upper part of the core the fuel rods 
are only covered with a thin film of water, outside of which 
steam mixed with water droplets is flowing. If the heat flux from a fuel rod becomes very large in relation 
to the coolant flow, there may be a risk of so-called 
dryout occurring, that is, the liquid film becomes so thin 
that it cannot hold together any more but breaks up and 
forms dry wall portions. This locally leads to a considerably 
deteriorated heat transfer between the fuel rod and the 
cooling water with an ensuing greatly increased wall temperature 
of the fuel rod. The increased wall temperature may 
lead to damage with serious consequences arising on the fuel 
rods. The risk of dryout is greatest at the upper part of 
the

A fuel assembly for a boiling water nuclear reactor, in 
which under operation coolant flows upwardly and thereby 

changes from a single-phase state to a two-phase state, 
which fuel assembly comprises 


a top tie plate (3) and a bottom tie plate (4), 
a number of fuel rods (1) arranged in a bundle therebetween, 
a number of essentially identical spacers (2) to retain 
the bundle, 
 
and which fuel assembly in its axial direction is divided 

into a plurality of fictitious first sub-lenghts (L1) which 
correspond to the distance between two adjacent spacers in 

the lower part of the fuel assembly, wherein two adjoining 
first sub-lengths constitute a second sub-length (L4),

 in that in at least one second 
sub-length, which at least for the most part is located in 

the upper part of the fuel assembly, two of said spacers 
(S22, S23, S42, S43, S52, S53) are arranged in such a way 

that they divide said second sub-length into three essentially 
equally long third sub-lengths (L2). 
A fuel assembly according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the first sub-length, which is nearest the 

top tie plate, is exempted from being included in said second 
sub-length.
