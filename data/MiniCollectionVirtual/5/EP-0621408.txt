<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fluid cylinder (1) which essentially comprises a housing (2), a cylinder housing (3) arranged in it, a piston rod (4) passing through the cylinder housing (3) in the axial direction, and a piston (5) arranged on the piston rod (4) and subdividing the interior space of the cylinder housing (3) into two cylinder chambers (6, 7). The interior space (4') of the piston rod (4) of hollow-cylindrical design is connected on the one hand to the two cylinder chambers (6, 7) of the cylinder housing (3) via bores or passages to be closed in a sealing manner or to be opened as a function of flow and on the other hand, for the inflow of the working fluid, is connected to at least one of the two mounted elements (53, 54) or to peripheral equipment arranged on them.
