<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous solution and a process for using the same allow mechanically preprocessed raw vegetables to be conserved and thus to be stored for a longer time. After being peeled, cut or otherwise mechanically preprocessed, the raw vegetables are washed and then treated with an aqueous solution containing sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium carbonate, citric acid and at least one element from the group of the alkaline and alkaline earth metals as components. The thus treated raw vegetables are then wrapped in plastic foils.

<CLAIMS>
Aqueous solution for preserving mechanically pre-processed 
and washed raw vegetables and which contains 

sodium hydrogen carbonate and/or sodium carbonate, 
citric acid and at least one element from the group of 

alkali metals and alkaline earth metals,
 
characterised in that the sodium hydrogen carbonate 

and/or sodium carbonate, the citric acid and the at least 
one element from the group of alkali metals and 

alkaline earth metals are present in a mixing ratio of 
3-5 : 1.5-2.5 : 0.5-1.5  

 
Aqueous solution according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the proportion of the 

components is 0.01 - 0.5 percent in weight of the 
aqueous solution. 
Aqueous solution according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the at least one element is from 

the group of alkali metals and alkaline earth 
metals magnesium, potassium and/or calcium. 
Aqueous solution according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that in addition a mixture of 

calcium and magnesium is included in a mixing ratio 
of 65 : 35 - 55 : 45. 
Aqueous solution according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the proportion of the 

components sodium hydrogen carbonate and/or sodium 
carbonate, citric acid and at least one element 

from the group of alkali metals and alkaline earth 
metals is 0.5 - 2.5 percent in weight of the 

aqueous solution. 
Process for preserving mechanically pre-processed 
and washed raw vegetables,
 
characterised in that after washing the raw 

vegetables are treated with an aqueous solution 
according to one of claims 1 - 3 and subsequently 

packed. 
Process according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that the raw vegetables are 

vacuum-packed after processing.  
 
Process for preserving raw vegetable scraps,
 
characterised in that a mixture of calcium and magnesium is added to the 

raw vegetable scraps in a mixing ratio of 65 : 35 - 55 : 45 and that 
subsequently the raw vegetable scraps are treated with an aqueous solution 

according to one of claims 1, 4 or 5. 
Process according to one of claims 6 - 8,
 
characterised in that the treatment lasts approx. 30 - 200 seconds. 
Process according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that foil with a thickness of 100 - 130 µm (µ) and a permeability 

of 10 - 20 cm
