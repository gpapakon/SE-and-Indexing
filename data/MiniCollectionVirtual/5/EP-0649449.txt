<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a soft coating for ferrous metal surfaces tanks, having a thickness of about 1-10 mils, comprising over-based alkaline aliphatic-aromatic organic sulfonate salt, an alkaline earth metal or zinc salt of a naphtalene sulfonate, a drying oil, a metal drier, and a paraffinic oil. The coating is particularly useful for coating ferrous metal surfaces, such as ballast tanks, which are exposed to seawater. The invention also relates to a process for inhibiting the corrosion of ballast tanks.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SOFT COATING COMPOSITIONS FOR METALSTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to solventless, soft coating compositions for metals exposed to aqueous environments comprising: (a) an overbased alkaline earth organic aliphatic or mixed one ring aliphatic-aromatic sulfonate salt, (b) an alkaline earth metal or zinc salt of an alkyl substituted naphthalene sulfonate, (c) a drying oil, (d) a metal drier, and (e) a heavy paraffinic oil. The coating composition is particularly useful for coating ferrous metal surfaces, such as ballast tanks, which are exposed to seawater. The invention also relates to a process for inhibiting the corrosion of metals exposed to aqueous environments.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCorrosion of metals can be a significant problem where metal surfaces are exposed to water, air, inorganic metal salts, and the like. One of the most severe sources of corrosion is a seawater environment, that is, seawater itself, seawater mist or spray, or the salty air which can exist near bodies of seawater. A seawater environment can attack and corrode ferrous and non-ferrous metals.A variety of equipment is subject to corrosion by seawater, including piping, dry-docks, steel cables, superstructures of an equipment on offshore drilling and production rigs, desalination plants, seawater mineral extracting plants, surfaces of ships and barges, and tanks subjected to seawater environment.Such equipment is quite large in surface area, but is not subject to severe frictional and abrasive force. It requires an inexpensive, yet effective, coating to protect its ferrous metal from the seawater environment. Soft skin coatings which do not contain expensive pigments are useful for this purpose. Although such coatings are not hard, they do provide a "skin" which protects the metal surface from the seawater environment. 

 Many soft skin coatings are known, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,925,087, 4,495,225, 4,675,215, and 4,729,791, which provide corrosion protection from aqueous environments for metal surfaces. All of these patents describe soft skin coatings which contain specified combinations of (a) an overbased alkaline earth organic aliphatic or mixed one ring aliphatic-aromatic sulfonate salt, (b) a drying oil, (c) a metal drier, (d) a paraffinic oil, and possibly (e) a solvent. These coatings disclosed provide corrosion resistance for metals which are exposed to aqueous environments, particularly saltwater environments. The thickness of the coatings is usually no greater than 10
