<ABSTRACT>
A grain storage tank (7) for an agricultural harvester (1) 
is provided which comprises side walls (22, 24), defining a top 

opening (34), and a pair of cover members (36) movable between a 
closed position, covering said top opening (34), and an open 

position, permitting access to the storage tank (7). Each cover 
member (36) is composed of a first lid (38) and a second lid (40) 

which are pivotally attached to each other and move relative to 
one another when moving the cover member (36) from said closed 

position towards said open position. The grain storage tank (7) 
is located inbetween an operator's station (5) and an engine 

compartment (10) and the arrangement is such that the cover 
members (36) can be opened from both locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a grain storage tank for
use on an agricultural harvester, such as a combine harvester for
example, and more particularly to the cover members used to close
off a top opening of the grain tank for shielding the stored
grain against adverse weather conditions.In the following description, right hand and left hand
references are determined by standing at the rear of the combine
harvester facing in a direction of forward, operative travel.
Also, in the following description, it is to be understood that
terms such as "forward", "rearward", "left", "right", "upwardly",
etc., are words of convenience and are not to be construed as
limiting terms.Commonly, nowadays combine harvesters are provided with
large capacity grain tanks for temporarily storing the harvested
grain before it is discharged, at appropriate intervals, into
attendant vehicles or any other suitable receptacle.
Traditionally, such a grain tank comprises a top opening not only
permitting to access the interior of the tank for cleaning or
servicing purposes but also providing the possibility to the
combine operator, eventually the farmer, to have a clear, general
top view of the grain being harvested and collected in the tank
enabling a visual inspection of the state of the grain sample.It is also a common practice to equip the grain tank with
one or more pivotable cover members, which, in the open position,
may extend upwardly from the tank and which serve to close off
the top opening of the grain tank either during road transport
for inhibiting the entrance of dirt on the one hand and reducing
the overall height of the combine harvester on the other hand, or
during a harvesting operation for shielding the grain contained
in the tank from an occasional, unexpected shower.Most often however, the covers are retained in an open
condition during the harvesting process permitting an
unobstructed top view on the collected grain as already mentioned 
and also allowing dust, which inevitably is produced under dry
harvesting conditions, to evacuate the grain tank. In the
generally upright position, the covers also may serve as
extensions to the top of the grain tank thereby increasing the
grain storage capacity thereof.Several different embodiments of grain tank covers are
employed in practice. In some arrangements, metal covers are used
which have the advantage of being solid but which mostly are
rather heavy and as a result are difficult to handle, especially
in case the top opening of voluminous grain tanks have to

<CLAIMS>
A grain storage tank (7) for an agricultural
harvester (1) comprising side walls (22, 24), defining a top

opening (34), and at least one cover member (36) movable
between a closed position, covering said top opening (34),

and an open position, permitting access to the storage tank
(7), and

   characterized in that

said at least one cover member (36) comprises a
two-part structure having a first lid (38) movable in a

substantially horizontal direction and a second lid (40),
operatively connected to said first lid (38);
said first and said second lids (38, 40) moving
relative to each other when moving the at least one cover

member (36) from said closed position towards said open
position.
A grain storage tank according to claim 1
characterized in that, upon opening the at least one cover

member (36), the first lid (38) moves in said substantially
horizontal direction, whereas the second lid (40) rises to

an upwardly inclined position.
A grain storage tank according to claim 2
characterized in that at least one of the side walls (22,

24) is prolonged with a fixed, generally horizontal top
shielding (28) extending in an inward direction relative to

the grain storage tank (7) over a distance approximately
equal to the width of the first lid (38) as measured in the

same direction. 
A grain storage tank according to claim 3
characterized in that the first lid (38) comprises a set of

rollers (46) slidably supporting said lid (38) on the
shielding (28); said lid (38), when in the open position,

being positioned on top of and completely covering said
shielding (28).
A grain storage tank according to claims 3 or 4
characterized in that the second lid (40) is provided with

pivot arms (56), which are fixedly attached to said second
lid (40) on the one hand and are pivotally connected to

pivots (58) in the grain tank (7) on the other hand; the
arrangement being such that in the raised position, said

second lid (40) extends generally upwardly from an inner
edge (30) of the shielding (28).
A grain storage tank according to any of the
preceding claims characterized in that pivots (42) pivotally

connect the first lid (38) to the second lid (40); the
arrangement being such that a movement imposed on one of

said lids (38, resp. 40) effects a corresponding movement of
the other one of said lids (40, resp. 38).
A grain storage tank according to any of the
claims 3 to 6 characterized in that the first and second

lids (38, 40), in the closed position, are generally in line
with each other and extend parallel to the top surface of

the shielding (28), whereas in the open position, the first
and second lids (38, 40) 
are at an angle relative to each
other. 
A grain storage tank according to any of the
preceding claims characterized in that an edge (66) of the

second lid (40) facing the first lid (38) is trough-shaped
and is subjected to an initially upwardly directed movement

away from the interior of the grain tank (7) when opening or
closing the at least one cover member (36).
An agricultural harvester (1) comprising an
operator's station (5), an engine compartment (10) and a

grain storage tank (7)

   characterized in that said tank (7) is according to any of the preceding
claims, and comprises a second

cover member (36), the cover members (36) being the mirror image
of each other and being oriented longitudinally of the harvester (1) as seen

in the direction of operative travel;

   the grain tank (7) being positioned inbetween said
operator's station (5) and said engine compartment (10) and

each cover member (36) being provided with handles (62, 68)
at longitudinal opposite sides thereof, enabling each cover

member (36) to be opened from a position either at the
operator's station (5) or at the engine compartment (10).
An agricultural harvester according to claim 8
characterized in that at the side of the grain tank (7)

adjacent to the operator's station (5), one of the cover
members (36) is provided with an elongated handle (68)

projecting transversely outwardly to the opposite side of
the tank (7) enabling both cover members (36) to be opened
