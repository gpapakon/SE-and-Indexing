<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel catalyst
composition which contains a zeolite composition improved
in catalytic properties or the zeolite composition and
metal components having hydrogenation activity.Catalysts containing zeolites have been used
extensively in catalytic reactions, for example, various
conversion reactions of hydrocarbons, such as
hydrogenolysis, including hydrocracking, catalytic
cracking, isomerization, alkylation, dealkylation,
disproportionation, oligomerization, aromatization,
hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming, and, further,
conversions of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons, such as
methanol, and hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. The
zeolites to be used in these reactions as catalysts or
catalyst components have generally been modified to control
or improve the catalytic properties, such as acidity or
hydrothermal resistance. There have been proposed various 
methods for modifying zeolites. The most conventional
modification is dealumination, which provides various
modified zeolites which are controlled or improved in
acidity or hydrothermal resistance. Dealumination has been
performed by various methods, for example, gaseous phase
dealuminations, such as steaming and treatment with gases
containing hydrochloric acid, and wet dealuminations, such
as treatment with aqueous mineral acid solutions and
treatment with various aqueous metal salt solutions.
Zeolites have been modified by not only these
dealuminations but also other methods, for example,
substitution of a part of Si or Al in zeolite lattice with
other atoms, such as Ti, Ga or Fe.Dealumination generally has the effects of
increasing acid strength per acid point of zeolites and
improving the hydrothermal resistance of zeolites
themselves, but has a shortcoming of decreasing active
points (particularly acidity).Also, zeolites have generally been mixed with
binders, such as alumina, to improve mechanical strength of
catalysts. Further, loading of compositions comprising
zeolites and alumina (or zeolites alone) with hydrogenation
metals, such as metals of Groups VIA and VIII of the
Periodic Table, is a conventional means for imparting the
catalysts with not only acidity but also sufficient 
hydrogenation properties.These are no more than typical examples of
various conventional methods of modifying zeolites and
preparing catalysts to improve catalytic properties of
zeolites-containing catalysts, and there are many other
reports concerning hydrocarbon conversion catalysts alone.As to known catalysts containing
