A process for producing biaxially drawn plastic 
bottles having excellent heat resistance and an 

apparatus therefor. The process comprises a step of 
biaxially drawing and free blow-molding the preformed 

article (P) to obtain a secondary molded article (S) thereof, a 
step of heating the secondary molded article (S) by 

inserting it for 0.3 to 5 seconds in the infrared rays 
emitted from an infrared-ray radiation member (30) that has a 

substantially planar radiation surface having a height 
larger than that of the secondary molded article in the 

direction of height and having a surface temperature of 
from 350°C to 1000°C, in order to obtain a tertiary

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing biaxially drawn plastic bottles having 
excellent heat resistance capable of retaining their 
shapes during the periods in which they are filled with 
liquids of high temperatures or during the heat 
treatment for sterilizing the contents. A process has been known in which a secondary 
molded article obtained by biaxially drawing and 
blow-molding a preformed article is heat-treated 
(thermally set) and the heat-treated article is finally 
blow-molded in a mold in order to impart heat resistance 
to the biaxially drawn plastic bottles, so that they can 
withstand filling of liquids of high temperatures or the 
step of sterilizing the contents. According to, for instance, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 39416/1992, the barrel of an 
intermediate container obtained by blow-molding a 
preformed article is heated at 180 to 220 °C for 1 to 15 
minutes to effect the heat crystallization and, in this 
case, the heating is accomplished in an atmosphere or by 
the hot air of 180 to 220 °C . According to Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 78728/1988, a step of thermal shrinking is provided 
between the step of final draw-molding and the step of 
primarily draw-molding the preform or the step of 
deforming the bottom, and in Fig. 9 thereof is shown a 
method of thermally shrinking the barrel of an 
intermediate container obtained by blow-molding a  
 
preformed article by using a plurality of linear heaters 
that are combined together maintaining a suitable gap. Moreover, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
122516/1988 teaches effecting the first stage of 
draw-molding based on a free blow-molding without using 
metal mold and effecting the intermediate heating by 
using an infrared ray heater in the step of effecting 
two stages of draw-molding and in the step of 
intermediate thermal shrinking. According to the conventional method of effecting 
two stages of draw-molding and the intermediate thermal 
shrinking, however, the temperature for heat-treating 
the intermediate molded particle tends to become locally 
uneven causing the final product to exhibit insufficient 
heat resistance. Moreover, the heat treatment is 
carried out requiring an extended period of time. 
Therefore, the residence time becomes long in the whole 
apparatus, and the production efficiency is low. That is, according to the prior art quoted first, 
the temperature of the intermediate container rises from 
the surface due to the conduction of heat and arrives at 
a
