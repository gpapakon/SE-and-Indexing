<ABSTRACT>
A device for delivering an aerosol, comprising: a casing member (14), a valve stem (12), and a diaphragm (16), wherein the diaphragm comprises a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block copolymer. Also disclosed are sealing members, e.g., for use in sealing an aerosol canister. The devices of the invention are particularly useful with formulations containing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane as the propellant.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR DELIVERING AN AEROSOLTechnical FieldThis invention relates to devices for delivering aerosols. In another aspect this invention relates to sealing members. In yet another aspect this invention relates to sealing members for use in devices for delivering aerosols. This invention also relates to thermoplastic polymer blends.Description of the Related ArtThe continuing use of aerosol formulations comprising conventional chlorofluorocarbon propellants is being debated due to the suspected role of such propellants in atmospheric depletion of ozone.Accordingly, alternative propellants such as HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and HFC-227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-- heptafluoropropane) are being developed to replace those conventional propellants thought to contribute to atmospheric ozone depletion.Containers for aerosol formulations commonly include a rubber valve seal intended to allow reciprocal movement of the valve stem while preventing leakage of propellant from the container. These rubber valve seals are commonly made of thermoset rubbers such as butyl rubber, butadiene-acrylonitrile rubbers, (•■Buna") and neoprene (polychloroisoprene) , which are compounded with vulcanizing agents prior to being fashioned into valve seals.Summary of the InventionIt has been found that some conventional devices for delivering aerosols suffer impaired performance when used in connection with HFC-134a and/or HFC-227. Accordingly, this invention provides a device for delivering an aerosol, comprising: a valve stem, a diaphragm having walls defining a diaphragm aperture, and a casing member having walls defining a 

casing aperture, wherein the valve stem passes through the diaphragm aperture and the casing aperture and is in slidable sealing engagement with the diaphragm aperture, and wherein the diaphragm is in sealing engagement with the casing member, the diaphragm material comprising a thermoplastic elastomer comprising styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block copolymer. The thermoplastic elastomer optionally further comprises a polyolefin such as polypropylene, and further optionally comprises a siloxane such as polydimethylsiloxane or polymethyloctylsiloxane. In a preferred embodiment the diaphragm material exhibits a leak rate of less than about 2500 mg/yr when tested according to the Leak Rate Test Method set forth herein.This invention also provides a metered-dose device for delivering an aerosol that comprises, in addition to the above-discussed valve stem, diaphragm, and casing member, a tank seal having
