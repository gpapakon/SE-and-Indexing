<ABSTRACT>
Method for forming an asymmetrical ceramic membrane, 
according to which a ceramic powder is applied on a 

porous carrier in a wet way and subsequently subject to 
a thermal treatment, characterized in that a suspension 

is made of the ceramic powder and an organic binder in a 
solvent in a weight ratio of the ceramic powder to the 

binder which is situated between 1 and 99, in that said 
suspension is applied on the porous carrier by means of 

film casting, in that the solvent is removed through 
extraction with a non-solvent, in that the binder is 

thermally removed and in that sintering is carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for forming an 
asymmetrical ceramic membrane, according to which a 
ceramic powder is applied on a porous carrier in a wet 
way and subsequently subject to a thermal treatment. Ceramic membranes with an asymmetrical top layer of 
ceramic powder particles are frequently used as filtering 
media, in particular for micro- and ultra-filtration, as 
these membranes retain their shape and show no 
perceptible deformations under normal pressures. Thanks 
to the asymmetrical shape, said membranes have a great 
permeability for a given thickness. Moreover, they can 
usually resist higher temperatures than organic 
membranes. They are only slowly eroded by the solid 
particles in the liquid to be filtered and can be made 
very hard. In a large number of cases they are highly 
resistant against corrosive chemical products. The most usual methods to form an asymmetrical ceramic 
membrane in a wet way is according to the sol/gel 
technique, whereby several layers are applied in order to 
switch over from the relatively large pores of the porous 
carrier to the micro-pores at the surface of the 
membrane. The application of several layers must be 
carried out in several stages, which implies that these 
methods are time-consuming. The invention aims to remedy this disadvantage and to 
provide a method for the formation of an asymmetrical 
membrane which is very simple and fast and which makes it 
possible to apply a ceramic asymmetrical layer, having  
 
the same characteristics as the multiple layers applied 
via the sol/gel technique, as a whole on the porous 
carrier through merely one application operation. This aim is reached according to the invention as a 
suspension is made of the ceramic powder and an organic 
binder in a solvent in a weight ratio of the ceramic 
powder to the binder which is situated between 1 and 99, 
as said suspension is applied on the porous carrier by 
means of film casting, as the solvent is removed through 
extraction with a non-solvent, as the binder is thermally 
removed and as sintering is carried out. The structure of the top layer on the porous carrier can 
be influenced through the selection and composition of 
the suspension and through the manner in which the 
solvent is removed. Water can be used as a non-solvent. In a practical embodiment of the invention, a tube is 
used as a porous carrier. In a special embodiment of the invention, a carrier made 
of ceramic material is used as a porous carrier. Other particularities and advantages of the
