<ABSTRACT>
A picker having a needle raising picker means (A) and a needle lowering picker means (B) which are used 
to increase and decrease stitches when a heel portion and a toe portion of a sock are knitted. When a longer butt (2a) 

of a knitting needle (2) at a knitting level impinges upon a free end portion (17a or 18a) of a needle raising picker 
member (17 or 18) as the cylinder of the knitting machine is turned reciprocatingly at the starting of the knitting of a 

heel portion or a toe portion, the needle raising picker member (17 or 18) is turned horizontally, and a tail end portion 
(17b or 18b) thereof is guided by an inclined guide slot (20a or 20b) and lowered. Consequently, a front end portion 

(17a or 18a) of the needle raising picker member moves up reversely to the tail end portion thereof to lift the knitting 
needle (2) from the upper side of a stitch cam (9a or 9b) to a position above a center cam (8) and move the knitting 

needle to a non-knitting level, whereby the number of stitches is reduced. In order to increase the number stitches, 
the longer butt (2a) of the knitting needle at a non-knitting level presses a front end (25a) of a needle lowering picker 

member (25), which is guided by an inclined cam portion (21a1 or 21a2) of a cam guide member (21a) and lowered 

to return the knitting needle to a knitting level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a picker device of
hosiery knitting machine for knitting a heal portion and a
toe portion of hosiery by plain knitting method, a jacquard
knitting method, and the like, and in particular, to a
picker device including an up-picker and a down-picker.Conventionally, stockings and socks (hosiery) are
knitted in the order of a leg portion, a heel portion, an
instep portion, and a toe portion. The heel portion and
the toe portion are knitted by increasing and decreasing
stitches along a gore line. The heel portion and the toe
portion of hosiery are knitted by a picker device that has
an up-picker and a down-picker. Conventionally, the leg
portion and the instep portion are knitted by continuously
rotating a knitting cylinder of the knitting machine. On
the other hand, when the heel portion and the toe portion
are knitted, the knitting cylinder is switched to
oscillation or alternate forward and backward rotation.
When the heel portion or the toe portion is knitted, the
number of stitches is gradually decreased and then
increased. When the stitches are decreased, a butt of a
knitting needle is raised by an up-picker and the knitting
needle is moved to a non-knitting level over a center cam.
On the other hand, when the stitches are increased, a
knitting needle in the non-knitting level is lowered to a
knitting level by a down-picker. Whenever the knitting
cylinder of the knitting machine is oscillated or rotates
forward and backward, the up-picker and the down-picker are
abutted by butts of knitting needles at their forward ends,
thereby raising and lowering the respective knitting
needles. Conventionally, a pair of up-pickers are
provided. These up-pickers are referred to as a left-side 
up-picker and a right-side up-picker. These up-pickers are
connected by a connecting member so that they move in
liaison in vertically different directions. A plate-shaped
picker cam is used to raise the up-picker while holding a
needle butt. Likewise, for the down-picker, another picker
cam is used. This picker device is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 31-8933.In the above described device, when the frequency of
the oscillating motion of the knitting cylinder becomes
high as the speed of the knitting machine is increased,
there occurs wear of the connecting plate connecting the
left-side up-picker and right-side up-picker and the
connecting pins therebetween. Thus, the knitting operation
becomes unstable and thereby the knitting machine
malfunctions with resultant lack
