decomposition of a tertiary alkyl
 ether in the vapor phase in 
the presence of a catalyst, wherein the catalyst used is a 

composition of: (i) 5 to 95 percent by weight of a crystalline 
aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica-to-alumina mole ratio 

of at least about 5 and a Contraint Index of about 1 to about 
12, and (ii) 95 to 5 percent by weight of a binder selected 

from amorphous silica, alumina, silica-alumina and mixtures 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of
tertiary olefins from the corresponding tertiary alkyl ethers, and
more particularly, to such process using an improved catalyst
therein.Tertiary olefins are important starting materials for the
preparation of polymers and specialty chemicals. For example,
isobutylene is used as a monomer for making elastomers such as
polyisobutylene and butyl rubber, and as an intermediate for the
production of isoprene, diisobutylene, tert-butyl phenol, tert-butyl
amine, tert-butyl mercaptan and methyl methacrylate.
Tertiary olefins usually are obtained by decomposing the
corresponding tertiary alkyl ethers. For example, decomposition of
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) provides isobutylene, while
decomposition of tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) will produce
isoamylene.Several processes have been proposed for preparing tertiary
olefins from tertiary alkyl ethers. For example, U.S. Patents
4,447,668, 4,551,567, 4,570,026 and 4,751,343 disclose a process
using a cation acidic exchange resin as catalyst; Japanese Patent
Publication 41,882/72 discloses a process in which MTBE is
decomposed using a alumina-type acidic solid catalyst having a 
specific surface area of at least 25 m2/g; U.S. Patent No. 4,006,198
describes a process using a catalyst composed of active alumina
modified by reaction with a silicon compound; Japanese Patent

using a catalyst comprising silica combined with various metal
oxides; Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification
94,602/74 proposes a process using an active carbon catalyst; U.S.
Patent 3,637,889 teaches a process using a metal sulfate as a
catalyst; U.S. Patent 4,398,051 describes a process using a
catalyst produced by calcining an aluminum compound supported on a
carrier containing silicon oxides at a temperature above that at
which the aluminum compound decomposes; U.S. Patent 4,395,580
describes a process in which the decomposition is carried out in
the presence of steam by using a catalyst comprising titanium,
hafnium or zirconium supported on alumina; Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open Specification 13,734/84 describes a process
in which the decomposition is carried out in the presence of steam
and the catalyst comprises heteropoly acids on neutral or acidic
supports; European Patent Application 118,085 relates a process
using a solid phosphoric acid catalyst which has been calcined at
a temperature higher than 500° C in an inert gas; Japanese
