<ABSTRACT>
A rack, in particular for displaying goods, comprises side walls are 
provided with insertion grooves (16,17) and are interconnected by flat 

crosswise-running bearers (6) for the goods, each with their side edge 
clamped in an insertion groove (16,17). Each side wall (1,2) has at 

least one side wall element (9) which is provided with grooves in which 
at least the axes coinciding with their lengthwise direction intersect 

each other in a common point of intersection. According to a first 
variant, each side wall element (9) consists of a closed, flat side wall 

face (14) with pairs of strips projecting relative to said side wall 
face, the strips of each pair forming an inserion groove between them 

and being interrupted at the position of a point of intersection with 
another insertion groove. According to a second variant, each side wall 

element consists of a flat side wall face (28) with insertion grooves 
(31-35) recessed relative to said side wall face, which insertion 

grooves are each bounded by a pair of strips (30) which are 
interconnected at their edge facing away from the side wall face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rack, in particular for displaying 
goods, comprising side walls which are provided with insertion grooves 
and are interconnected by flat crosswise-running bearers for the goods, 
each with their side edge clamped in an insertion groove. Such a rack is 
known from German Patent Application DE-A-2820100. This known rack makes 
it possible for a number of shelves to be clamped horizontally between 
two vertical walls. The disadvantage of this known rack is that its potential uses 
are limited. As already mentioned, the shelves can only be positioned 
horizontally, which makes such a rack unsuitable for holding, for 
example, loose goods such as sweets or smaller technical articles such as 
screws and the like. Another disadvantage is that the rigidity of the construction 
made up of shelves and side walls leaves something to be desired. The 
connection between shelves and side walls is relatively flexible, in such 
a way that a reinforcing rear wall generally has to be used to bring the 
rigidity up to the mark. This in turn means that the rack is accessible 
at only one side, which makes it less suitable for a striking display of 
the articles concerned. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a rack of 
the type described above which does not have these disadvantages. This is 
achieved through the fact that each side wall has at least one side wall 
element which is provided with grooves in which at least the axes 
coinciding with their lengthwise direction intersect each other in a 
common point of intersection. Such a side wall element can have grooves 
running at arbitrary angles relative to each other and to the horizontal, 
but it preferably has at least one groove running horizontally. This has 
the advantage that the rack can be constructed without regard to the type 
of products. For normally stackable products, such as packs, the bearers 
can be placed in the horizontal grooves. The stability of the rack can be increased in an embodiment in 
which provision is made for a tensioning means which can be fixed to both 
side walls in each case near the common point of intersection of the 
grooves. The tensioning means can advantageously be situated directly 
below a bearer placed in the grooves and has a supporting effect thereon. 
Such a tensioning means not only holds the bearer pressed into the 
grooves, but also makes it possible for the bearer to be made relatively  
 
light in construction, since the latter itself need not have any great 
flexural

<CLAIMS>
Rack, in particular for displaying goods, comprising side walls 
which are provided with insertion grooves and are interconnected by flat 

crosswise-running bearers for the goods, each with their side edge 
clamped in an insertion groove, characterized in that each side wall has 

at least one side wall element which is provided with grooves in which at 
least the axes coinciding with their lengthwise direction intersect each 

other in a common point of intersection. 
Rack according to Claim 1, in which the grooves of a side wall 
element run at regular intervals radially relative to said point of 

intersection. 
Rack according to Claim 2, in which provision is made for a 
tensioning means which can be fixed to in each case two side walls near 

the common point of intersection of the grooves. 
Rack according to Claim 3, in which the tensioning means is 
situated directly below a bearer placed in the grooves and has a 

supporting effect thereon. 
Rack according to Claim 3 or 4, in which the tensioning means 
holds the bearer pressed into the grooves. 
Rack according to Claim 5, in which the tensioning means is 
held clamped at its end faces against corresponding stop faces on the 

side walls. 
Rack according to Claim 6, in which the tensioning means has a 

projection which projects into an opening provided in each stop face of 
the side walls, and which interacts with a fixing means which can be 

supported on the supporting face facing away from the stop face of the 
side in question. 
Rack according to Claim 7, in which projection and fixing means 
form a bayonet connection. 
Rack according to Claim 8, in which the projection bears at 
least one helical groove, in which groove a lip of a bayonet ring can be 

accommodated, in such a way that on turning of the bayonet ring the 
tensioning means is clamped against the side wall. 
Rack according to one of Claims 4 - 9, in which the tensioning 
means is in the form of a flexurally rigid bar with a flat face 

supporting the bearer, and at each of its ends the tensioning means bears 
an unround positioning element which fits into a corresponding unround 

positioning recess of the corresponding side wall, which element and 
 

recess can be brought into interaction with each other in different 
angular positions. 
Rack according to one of Claims 2 - 10, in which the grooves 
each consist of two groove parts which lie in line with each other at 

either side of the point of intersection. 
Rack according to one of Claims 1 - 11, in which a side wall 
element consists of a flat side wall face with insertion grooves which 

are recessed relative to said flat side wall face, which insertion 
grooves are each bounded by a pair of strips which are interconnected at 

their edge facing away from the side wall face. 
Rack according to Claim 12, in which a pair of strips is 
provided in each case at each edge of a side wall face, in such a way 

that at least the outermost strips are interconnected to form a closed 
edge reinforcement running all the way round. 
Rack according to one of the preceding claims, in which a 
bearer is provided which at one or both longitudinal edges bears a 

reinforcement flange which is flanged through a specific angle, each 
reinforcement flange being clamped at its side edge in an insertion 

groove which intersects the insertion groove in which the bearer is 
clamped at the same angle. 
Rack according to one of the preceding claims, in which each 
side wall comprises a number of side wall elements stacked on top of one 

another.
