<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the continuous production 
of para-cumylphenol and, in particular, to the 
stabilization of color using hypophosphorous acid. Para-cumylphenol is prepared by the reaction of 
purified phenol and alpha-methylstyrene in the presence 
of an acidic catalyst. During the process, the 
reaction effluent stream is stripped of the phenol 
solvent carrier in a stripper column and later 
subjected to nitrogen desorbing to remove residual 
phenol and other volatile impurities. Long residence 
times in the phenol stripping column and the nitrogen 
desorber have resulted in thermal/oxidative degradation 
of the para-cumylphenol product, leading to significant 
color formation which is undesirable. The invention is based upon the discovery that 
hypophosphorous acid is effective to reduce or 
eliminate color in para-cumylphenol production. In a 
particular embodiment, the invention is directed to a 
method for continuous manufacture of a color stabilized 
para-cumylphenol comprising the step of reacting a 
stream containing purified phenol and alpha-methylstyrene 
in an acidic catalyst followed by removal 
of bulk phenol in a stripper column at elevated 
temperature and reduced pressure. Residual phenol is 
then desorbed within a packed column operating at  
 
elevated temperature and near atmospheric pressure. In 
the process, an effective amount of H₃PO₂ is added to 
the effluent stream for stabilizing the color of the 
para-cumylphenol product. Fig. 1 is a graphical representation of the effect 
of added hypophosphorous acid on the UV absorption in 
the production of para-cumylphenol; and  Fig. 2 is a graphical representation of the effect 
of hypophosphorous acid on the APHA color in the 
production of para-cumylphenol. Para-cumylphenol is continuously produced by the 
reaction of feed stream of purified phenol (e.g. 99.5%) 
and alpha-methylstyrene in the presence of an acidic 
catalyst, such as HCl or an ion exchange catalyst bed. 
Bulk phenol is removed in a stripper column operated at 
elevated temperature and reduced pressure (e.g. about 
346°F and about 135 mmHg absolute). Thereafter, 
residual phenol and some light boiling impurities are 
removed from the stream in a packed column using 
nitrogen as a desorbing agent at elevated temperature 
(e.g. about 365°F) and near atmospheric pressure. The related U.S. Patent Application Serial 
No. 07/891,025, filed June 1, 1992, Docket No. 8CL-6982, 
incorporated herein by reference, sets forth in 
detail a process for the preparation of
