<ABSTRACT>
A compound transmission (110) of lighter weight and/or shorter axial 
length as compared to comparable prior art transmissions is provided. The 

compound transmission of the present invention utilizes main transmission section 
countershafts (124) and auxiliary transmission section countershafts (162) which 

are coaxial and are supported for independent rotation within a common 
transmission housing (116) solely by means of bearings (126, 162D) carried by the 

forward transmission end wall (116A) and the rearward transmission end wall 
(116B). The transmission mainshaft (146) is supported for rotation within the 

transmission housing solely by the input shaft (118) and/or the output shaft (158). 
One of the countershafts (162) and/or the mainshaft (146) may be of a tubular 

structure and telescopically surrounds the other of the countershafts (124) and one 
of the input and/or output shafts, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent 5 370 013,
titled HELICALLY GEARED COMPOUND TRANSMISSION, assigned to
the same assignee, Eaton Corporation, as this application
and filed the same day, May 20, 1993 as this application.The present invention relates to an improved compound
mechanical change gear transmission structure, preferably
for compound transmissions of the multiple substantially
identical countershaft type. In particular, the present
invention relates to an improved compound mechanical
transmission structure allowing, for a given transmission
capacity and life, the provision of a lighter, axially
shorter and/or less costly transmission as compared to
comparable prior art transmission structures.Compound change gear transmissions, usually vehicular
transmissions for heavy duty vehicles, of the type having
one or more auxiliary sections connected in series with a
main transmission section are well known in the prior art.
Briefly, by utilizing main and auxiliary transmission
sections connected in series, assuming proper sizing of
the ratio steps, the total of available transmission 
ratios is equal to the product of the main and auxiliary
section ratios. By way of example, at least in theory, a
compound change gear transmission comprising a four (4)
forward speed main section connected in series with a
three (3) speed auxiliary section will provide twelve (4 x
3 = 12) available forward ratios.Auxiliary transmission sections are of three general
types: range type, splitter type or combined range/splitter
type.In compound transmissions having a range type auxiliary
section, the auxiliary section ratio step or steps
are greater than the total ratio coverage of the main
transmission section ratios used in both ranges and the
main section is shifted progressively through its ratios
in each range. Examples of compound transmissions having,
range type auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,105,395; 2,637,222 and 2,637,221.In compound transmissions having a splitter type
auxiliary section, the ratio steps of the splitter auxiliary
section are less than the ratio steps of the main
transmission section and each main section ratio is split,
or subdivided, by the splitter section. Examples of compound
change gear transmissions having a splitter type
auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,290,515; 3,799,002; 4,440,037 and 4,527,447.In a combined range and splitter type auxiliary
section, or sections, both range and splitter type ratios
are provided
