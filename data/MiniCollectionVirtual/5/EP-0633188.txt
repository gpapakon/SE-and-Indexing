<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for forming a cover about an 
article and for automatically fastening the cover to the 

article, and optionally for automatically placing a label 
on the cov
ered article. The article may be an article such 
as a potted plant and the cover may be a decorative cover. 

The invention satisfies the need for a means for rapidly 
covering and fastening the cover about an article with a 

minimal amount of manual effort and in a location having a 
limited amount of available space. The apparatus comprises 

a rotatable platform having at least one opening sized to 
receive the article. At least portions of a sheet of 

material are supported in a position generally over the 
opening. A cover forming assembly having contacting 

portions for contacting the sheet of material is disposed 
in the opening in the support surface. The apparatus also 

comprises a tying device for automatically applying a band 
or fastener about a portion of the outer surface of the 

covered article for fastening the cover about the article 
when the platform is rotated into a fastening position. The 

apparatus may also comprise a labeling device for 
automatically applying a label to a portion of the outer 

surface of the cover of the covered article before the 
covered article is removed from the platform. The apparatus 

may further comprise an assembly for securing and releasing 
the sheet of material in the cover forming position so the 

sheet is immobilized until after the sheet is moved to the  
 

forming position. The apparatus may further comprise an 
assembly such as a sheet feeder for automatically placing a 

sheet of material on the support surface. The apparatus may 
further comprise a pick and place apparatus for 

automatically picking the article up from an article supply 
and placing the article into the opening to form the 

covered article. The apparatus may further comprise means 
for automatically removing the covered article from the 

opening of the platform. The apparatus may further 
comprise means for automatically elevating the covered 

article as the removal station is approached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
placing a cover about an article, automatically applying a
fastener about the covered article and removing the covered
article, and more particularly to
such apparatus and methods wherein the article is a pot having a
botanical item disposed therein.A wrapping and tying machine is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
1,498,981. The machine is used for wrapping cylindrically shaped
pieces of laundry blue in cloth and tying a string around the
open end. In operation, an operator lays a piece of cloth in a
pan and forces a piece of blue with the covering into a holder
under the pan. At the same time, an adjacent piece of wrapped
blue is tied and then ejected.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method
for applying and fastening a sheet of material about an article,
the article having a lower end and an outer peripheral surface,
the method comprising: providing a rotatable platform having
means for rotation, the platform having a support surface formed
thereon and one or more openings extending through the support
surface; placing a sheet of material in a cover forming position
over the opening and on the support surface; rotating the
platform wherein the opening with the sheet thereover is moved
into a forming position at a forming station; positioning the
article in a position over the sheet of material and in a
position wherein the lower end of the article is disposed
generally above and near the sheet of material; forming the sheet
of material about the article by moving the article in a
direction which causes the lower end of the article to engage a
portion of the sheet of material, the article and portions of the
sheet of material passing through the opening causing the sheet
of material to contact or nearly contact the outer peripheral
surface of the article as the article is moved downward, wherein
the sheet is wrapped about the outer peripheral surface of the
article to form a cover about the article, the cover having an
inner surface facing the outer peripheral surface of the article 
and an exposed outer surface, and a portion of the sheet
extending beyond an upper end of the article; rotating the
platform wherein the opening containing the covered article is
moved into a fastening position at a fastening station;
automatically applying a fastener about a portion of the outer
surface of the cover of the article; rotating the platform
wherein the opening containing the covered article is moved to a
removal station; and removing
