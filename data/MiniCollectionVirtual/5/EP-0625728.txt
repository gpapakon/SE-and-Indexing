<ABSTRACT>
A radiation-sensitive composition especially 
adapted to prepare a lithographic printing plate that 

is sensitive to both ultraviolet and infrared radiation 
and capable of functioning in either a positive-working 

or negative-working manner is comprised of (1) a resole 
resin, (2) a novolac resin, (3) a latent Bronsted acid 

and (4) an infrared absorber. The solubility of the 
composition in aqueous alkaline developing solution is 

both reduced in exposed areas and increased in 
unexposed areas by the steps of imagewise exposure to 

activating radiation and heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to
lithographic printing
plates. More specifically, this invention relates to
lithographic printing plates with
radiation-sensitive compositions comprising both a
resole resin and a novolac resin and to
methods of forming a lithographic
printing surface.The art of lithographic printing is based
upon the immiscibility of oil and water, wherein the
oily material or ink is preferentially retained by the
image area and the water or fountain solution is
preferentially retained by the non-image area. When a
suitably prepared surface is moistened with water and
an ink is then applied, the background or non-image
area retains the water and repels the ink while the
image area accepts the ink and repels the water. The
ink on the image area is then transferred to the
surface of a material upon which the image is to be
reproduced; such as paper, cloth and the like.
Commonly the ink is transferred to an intermediate
material called the blanket which in turn transfers the
ink to the surface of the material upon which the image
is to be reproduced.A very widely used type of lithographic
printing plate has a light-sensitive coating applied to
an aluminum base support. The coating may respond to
light by having the portion which is exposed become
soluble so that it is removed in the developing
process. Such a plate is referred to as positive-working. 
Conversely, when that portion of the coating
which is exposed becomes hardened, the plate is
referred to as negative-working. In both instances the
image area remaining is ink-receptive or oleophilic and
the non-image area or background is water-receptive or
hydrophilic. The differentiation between image and
non-image areas is made in the exposure process where a
film is applied to the plate with a vacuum to insure
good contact. The plate is then exposed to a light
source, a portion of which is composed of UV radiation.
In the instance where a positive plate is used, the
area on the film that corresponds to the image on the
plate is opaque so that no light will strike the plate,
whereas the area on the film that corresponds to the
non-image area is clear and permits the transmission of
light to the coating which then becomes more soluble
and is removed. In the case of a negative plate the
converse is true. The area on the film corresponding
to the image area is clear while the non-image area is
opaque. The coating under the clear area of film is
hardened by the action of light while the area not
struck by light is removed. The

A lithographic printing plate comprising a
support and an imaging layer that is sensitive to both

ultraviolet and infrared radiation and is capable of
functioning in either a positive-working or negative-working

manner,

the printing plate being characterized in that the
imaging layer is coated out of a coating composition

that comprises as the only essential components: (l)
a resole resin at from 1.5 to 6% by weight of the

total coating composition, (2) a novolac resin at from
1.5 to 6% by weight of the total coating composition,

(3) a latent Bronsted acid at from 0.3 to 1% by weight
of the total coating composition, and (4) an infrared

such that imagewise exposure of the imaging layer to

activating radiation followed by heating brings about
a catalyzed matrix-forming reaction between the resole

alkaline developing solution and unexposed areas in
the imaging layer more soluble in the aqueous alkaline

developing solution.
