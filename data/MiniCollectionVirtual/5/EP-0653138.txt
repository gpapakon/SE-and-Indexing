<ABSTRACT>
A selective call system, such as a digital paging system, which is able to provide a faster message service than is possible with a standard protocol. Messages are sent in batches and each batch is pre-fixed by a synchronisation code word which is always sent at the same bit rate irrespective of the bit rate used for the message code words in the batches. A selective call receiver (P) in response to the receipt of a synchronisation code word is able to condition itself to be able to receive and decode the concatenated message. The faster message service can offer message formats which differ in bit rates, frame structures, code word structures and/or number of modulation levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
DESCRIPTIONA SELECTIVE CALL SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a selective call system, such as a paging system, and particularly to a system providing high speed alpha and numeric message capability.For convenience of description the present invention will be described in the context of the CCIR Radiopaging Code No. 1 (otherwise known as POCSAG) which is described in detail in "The book of the CCIR Radiopaging Code No. 1" published by the Radiopaging Code Standards Group (RCSG) and obtainable from British Telecom, Radiopaging, London, England. However the invention may be applied to systems using other digital paging codes.Appendix 1 of the mentioned book discloses the Specification for a standard Code Format for use in Wide Area Radiopaging Systems, the details of which will be known by those skilled in the art. However for the sake of completeness the signal format used comprises a batch structure consisting of preamble and a succession of concatenated batches. Each batch consists of a synchronisation code word plus 8 frames each comprising 2 code words, making a total of 17 code words. There are two types of code words, address code words and message code words each comprising 32 bits. In the case of a message code word 20 bits, that is bit 2 to bit 21 inclusive, form a data field and these are followed by parity check bits. In the case of an address code word, bits 2 to 19 are address bits, bits 20,21 are function bits and are used to select the format of decoding of concatenated message code words. Appendix 1, subsection 4.1 states that for the sole transmission of messages in decimal numbers, 4 bits per character are used and the function bits are set to 00. Subsection 4.2 refers to an Alpha-numeric or General Data Format and states that the ISO 7-bit coded character set is used and that the function bits are set to 11. When sending a message, the batch structure is maintained and in particular a synchronisation code word is included at the 

beginning of each batch. Thus a message comprises an address code word and concatenated message code words plus a synchronisation code word as required at the beginning of each new batch. The signals are generally sent at 1200 bits/second as 2-level signals. Whilst the POCSAG code is used quite widely by paging operators, there is a desire to increase the speed of numeric only, alpha only and alpha-numeric messages, particularly in city areas where there is generally a higher level of radio traffic in a relatively small radio coverage area compared to

<CLAIMS>
CLAIM(S)
1. A selective call system comprising a base station having means for transmitting digital paging signals in the form of batches comprising address signals and/or message signals and at least one selective call receiver having means for receiving signals addressed to it, characterised in that the base station has means for producing at least two different types of message signals, in that the base station has means for prefixing each batch with a synchronisation code word indicative of the message type, said synchronisation code word having a bit rate which is the same for all synchronisation code words irrespective of content, the selective call receiver having means responsive to the receipt of a synchronisation code word for conditioning the selective call receiver so that it can receive and decode a message signal addressed to the receiver in a batch concatenated with the received synchronisation code word.
2. A system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the bit rate of the message code words in a batch concatenated with a synchronisation code word is higher than that of the synchronisation code word.
3. A system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bit rate of at least one of the two types of message signal is at least twice that of the synchronisation code word.
4. A system as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the higher the bit rate of a message signal, the larger the number of code words to a frame and the higher the number of frames to a batch.
5. A system as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the higher bit rate message code words are modulated at M-levels, where M is an even integer equal to at least 2.
6. A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the format of an address code word of a numeric only message is different from the format of an address code word of an alpha message.
7. A system as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that 


alpha code words of the second type are bit interleaved.
8. A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that each batch includes a channel indicator codeword.
9. A selective call receiver comprising receiving means, a decoding stage coupled to the receiving means and control means coupled to the decoding stage, wherein the control means has means for recognising a synchronisation code word indicative of one of at least two message types and means for conditioning at least the decoding stage to be able to decode the type of message signal concatenated with the synchronisation code word.
10. A receiver as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the control means includes clock means for producing clock signals having at least two different frequencies, and in that said control means causes the clock means to produce a clock signal having the same frequency at the occurrence of each synchronisation code word.
