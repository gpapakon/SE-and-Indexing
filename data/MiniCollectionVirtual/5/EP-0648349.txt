<ABSTRACT>
A filter is formed on a solid state imager by: forming, on the imaging surface of the imager, an adherent layer of a dye-containing photoresist composition comprising a photoresist resin and a thermochromic dye, this dye being substantially non-absorbent of actinic radiation of a first wavelength, but capable, upon heating, of undergoing a thermally-induced color change which renders it absorptive of actinic radiation of the first wavelength; imagewise exposing the adherent layer of dye-containing photoresist composition to actinic radiation of the first wavelength; removing one of the exposed and unexposed areas of the layer, while leaving the other of the exposed and unexposed areas on the imaging surface, to form a pattern of filter elements; and heating the solid state imager to a temperature and for a time sufficient to cause the dye to undergo its color change, thereby causing the filter elements to become absorptive of radiation of the first wavelength. This process avoids the long exposure times otherwise required when forming filter elements of a color which strongly absorbs the exposing radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming a filter on a solid state 
imager, and to a solid state imager provided with this filter. To obtain color image recording using solid state imagers such as 
charge coupled devices, optical filters in a multicolor stripe or mosaic form are 
employed; in many cases, these filters are formed directly upon the photosensitive 
surface of the solid state imager. Such filters are normally provided with elements 
having two or three differing colors. (The term "having color" is used herein to 
mean "transmitting electromagnetic radiation of a particular wavelength", and does 
not necessarily refer to visible radiation.) For example, a two color filter may have 
yellow and cyan elements which overlap in part, the overlap area providing, in 
effect, a green element. A three color filter will typically have red, green and blue, 
or cyan, yellow and magenta elements. A number of processes are described in the art for preparing such 
filters. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,239,842 describes a process for producing 
a color filter array by depositing successively on a semi-conductive layer, such as 
a charge coupled device, a sub-coat, a polymeric mordant, and a photoresist. The 
photoresist layer is exposed and developed to form a mask, and dye is then 
heat-transferred through the apertures in the photoresist into the polymeric mordant. 
Finally, the photoresist is stripped. U.S. Patent No. 4,565,756 describes a color filter formed by laying on 
a substrate a transparent layer, forming by photolithography a pattern of filter 
elements separated by separation regions (grooves or dye-impermeable regions) in 
the transparent layer, laying a barrier layer over the transparent layer, forming by 
photolithography a pattern of apertures in the barrier layer, this pattern of apertures 
corresponding to the location of a first system of filter elements, dyeing the first 
system of filter elements through these apertures, and finally removing the barrier  
 
layer. The formation of the barrier layer and the subsequent steps of the process are 
then repeated for other colors. A variety of techniques have also been developed for producing the 
fine lines and other image elements needed in the production of integrated electrical 
circuits and in lithography. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,873,361 describes a 
process for producing thin films for integrated circuits by depositing a) a photoresist 
(polymeric) layer which is baked to render it non-photosensitive; b) a metallic

process comprises: 


forming, on the imaging surface of the imager, an adherent layer of 
a dye-containing photoresist composition comprising a photoresist resin and a dye, 
imagewise exposing the adherent layer of dye-containing photoresist 
composition to actinic radiation of the first wavelength; 
removing one of the exposed and unexposed areas of the layer, while 
leaving the other of the exposed and unexposed areas on the imaging surface, to 

form a pattern of filter elements,

the pattern of filter elements, the solid state imager is heated to a temperature and 
for a time sufficient to cause the thermochromic dye to undergo its color change, 

thereby causing the filter elements to become absorptive of radiation of the first 
wavelength.
