<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic, resinous mixture, useful in the 
preparation of compatible blends of polyurethane with 

polyolefins, is disclosed. The mixture contains 

(i) a thermoplastic polyurethane, and 
(ii) an agent which is the product of the reaction between 
a polyamide and a modified polyolefin. 
The mixture may be used as a component in 
thermoplastic molding compositions which contain a polyolefin, 

preferably polypropylene. Improved mechanical properties 
characterize the molding compositions thus prepared.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic compositions 
and is more particularly concerned with compatibilized blends 
of polypropylene with polyurethanes. A thermoplastic, resinous mixture, useful in the 
preparation of compatible blends of polyurethane with 
polyolefins, is disclosed. The mixture contains 
(i) a thermoplastic polyurethane, and (ii) an agent which is the product of the reaction between 
a polyamide and a modified polyolefin. The inventive mixture may be used as a component in 
thermoplastic molding compositions which contain a polyolefin, 
preferably polypropylene. Improved mechanical properties 
characterize the molding compositions thus prepared. Thermoplastic polyurethane (herein TPU) and isotactic 
polypropylene (herein i-PP) are intrinsically incompatible, 
except at the lowest levels of incorporation of one resin in 
the other. It has been suggested that TPU/i-PP blends would 
offer advantages in terms of cost, hydrolytic and thermal 
stability, stain and solvent resistance mechanical properties 
and good adhesion to polyolefin substrates. Blends of these 
resins are typically delaminated and their mechanical 
properties are poor. Delamination in the present context means 
the separation of polymer blend into its components in a molded 
part. This is evidenced by either the lowering of some 
measured physical property to a value below that for either one 
of the components or by visual observation of separation (for 
instance, fracture or crumbling).  Relevant compositions were disclosed in the article 
"Polyurethane - Polypropylene Blends", Z.S. Petrovic et al in 
J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 42, 1991 pp. 779; the preparation of these 
blends was noted to be difficult, especially for blends 
containing more than 30% polyurethane. U.S. Patent No. 3,272,890 discloses blends of 
polyurethane and polyethylene. The method of preparation of 
the blend entails melting and fluxing the polyethylene in a 
Banbury mixer and then adding the polyurethane. Systems 
containing dispersed polyethylene in polyurethane have been 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,310,604; 3,351,676; and 3,358,052; 
other relevant blends having improved processability have been 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,929,928. U.S. Patents 4,410,595 and 4,423,185 disclose 
compositions containing thermoplastic polyurethanes and 
polyolefins, the later being modified with functional groups 
including carboxylic acid anhydride. Japanese Patent 
Application 74,9831 (Derwent Abstract 24216V) discloses 
modified ionomer polymer blends containing
