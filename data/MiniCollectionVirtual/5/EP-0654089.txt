<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a non-naturally occurring, recombinant equine herpesvirus. The invention also relates to a recombinant equine herpesvirus capable of replication which comprises viral DNA from a species of equine herpesvirus and foreign DNA, the foreign DNA being inserted into the equine herpesviral DNA at a site which is not essential for replication of the equine herpesvirus. The invention also relates to DNA encoding the US2 protein of an equine herpesvirus. The invention relates to homology vectors for producing recombinant equine herpesviruses which produce recombinant equine herpesviruses by inserting foreign DNA into equine herpesviral DNA. The invention further relates to a method of producing a fetal-safe, live recombinant equine herpesvirus.

<DESCRIPTION>
Within this application, several publications are
referenced by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full
citations for these references may be found at the end of
the specification immediately preceding the claims. The
disclosures of these publications
describe the state of the art to
which this invention pertains.The present invention involves live recombinant equine
herpesviruses which comprises the genomic
DNA of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) or 4 (EHV-4) from which a DNA sequence has
been deleted from the US2 gene, shown for EHV-1 in SEQ ID NO: 1 and for EHV-4
in SEQ ID NO: 3 inactivating said US2 gene. They are useful in the preparation of vaccines to
protect horses from various species of naturally-occurring
infectious equine herpesvirus. The equine
herpesvirus is a member of the family herpesviridae,
which are commonly known as the herpesviruses.Generally, herpesviruses contain 100,000 to 200,000 base
pairs of DNA as their genetic material, and several areas
of the genomes of various members have been identified
that are not essential for the replication of virus in
vitro in cell culture. Modifications of these regions of
the DNA have been known to lower the pathogenicity of the
virus, i.e. to attenuate the virus when it infects an
animal species. For example, inactivation of the
thymidine kinase gene of either human herpes simplex
virus (29) or pseudorabies virus of swine (38) renders
these herpesviruses less pathogenic. Removal of specific regions of the repeat region of a
human herpes simplex virus have been shown to render the
virus less pathogenic (32, 39). Furthermore, a repeat
region has been identified in Marek's disease virus that
is associated with viral oncogenicity (13). A region in
herpesvirus saimiri has similarly been correlated with
oncogenicity (21). Removal of a specific region of the
repeat region renders pseudorabies virus less pathogenic
(US Pat. 4,877,737). A region'in pseudorabies virus has
been shown to be deleted in naturally-occurring vaccine
strains (22). These deletions are at least in part
responsible for the lack of pathogenicity of these
strains.It is generally agreed that herpesviruses contain non-essential
regions of DNA in various parts of the genome,
and that modification of these regions can attenuate the
virus, leading to a non-pathogenic strain from which a
vaccine may be derived. An attenuated EHV-4 vaccine with a deletion of and/or
an insertion in the thymidine kinase gene has been described (53). The degree of attenuation of the
virus is important to the
