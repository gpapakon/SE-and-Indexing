<ABSTRACT>
The body cleansing agents are based on anionic surfactants containing 0.1 to 10% by weight of a mixture of     a) C36-dimer and/or C54-trimer fatty acid and b) at least one cationic compound which is liquid at 15 to 25@C and is selected from the group of ethoxylated methyl glucoside hydroxypropyltrialkylammonium halides in which the total of the C atoms in the trialkylammonium group is between 12 and 37, and/or of polydimethylsiloxanes which contain quaternary ammonium groups and have an average molecular weight between 1500 and 3000.
