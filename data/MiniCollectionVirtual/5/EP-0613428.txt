<ABSTRACT>
A bus system (1) has several control appliances (2) in a motor vehicle that are interconnected by a vehicle bus (3). The data transmitted on the bus (2) is read out by a data module (4) which derives therefrom non-urgent information, for example statistical information. This information is transmitted as blocks of news at a low repeating frequency of transmission over the bus (3). They may then by tapped from the bus and evaluated by the individual control appliances (2) as required. The data module (4) further evaluates data supplied by various sensors (S) arranged in the motor vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
Bus system (1), in particular in a motor vehicle, 
which comprises a plurality of interconnected control 

devices (2), and in which data transmitted on the bus are 
evaluated in a central device, characterized in that 


the device is constructed as a data module (4) by means 
of which the data transmitted on the bus (3) are read out 

and non-urgent items of information are generated from 
them, in that 
these items of information are output via the bus (3) 
as messages with a low transmission repetition frequency, 

and in that 
they are extracted from the bus as required by the 
individual control devices (2). 
Bus system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that data supplied by sensors (7) in the motor vehicle 

are evaluated in the data module (4). 
Bus system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that display data which are output via an optical or 

acoustic display unit (5) are generated in the data 
module (4). 
Bus system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the messages comprise a first byte or word, which 

represents a transmission cycle counter, and one to four 
further bytes, which contain information to be provided. 
Bus system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the data module (4) is a component of a vehicle 

computer. 
Bus system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that all the information generated by the data module (4)  

 
is output in each case via the bus (3) within a time 

interval of 30 seconds.
