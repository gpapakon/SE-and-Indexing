<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an edged connector including a shell 
(1) having two symmetrical rows of vertical slots (11), each 

vertical slot (11) being formed of an upper space (111) and a 
lower space (112) linked together to hold a metal contact 

spring plate (2) and a conductor clamp (3), wherein the metal 
contact spring plate (2) consists of a bent (210) in the middle 

disposed between the upper and lower spaces, a projecting strip 
(211) stopped above the lower space (112), a curved clamping 

portion at one end received in the upper space (111) for making 
an electric contact with an external connector, a wedge portion 

(22) at an opposite end vertically received in the lower space 
(112) and terminated to a sloping tail; the conductor clamp (3) 

has a first bent and a second bent stopped within the lower 
space (112) at two opposite locations, a rear end (33) passed 

over a front end thereof and stopped against the wedge portion 
(22) of the metal contact spring plate (2) for clamping a 

conductor on the metal contact spring plate (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an edge 
connector which comprises a metal contact spring plate 
and a conductor clamp in either slot on the shell 
thereof for quick installation of conductors. A conventional edge connector for use in TV 
game machines, as shown in Figure 8, is generally 
comprised of a shell (10) having rows of contact 
mounting slots (101), a plurality of contacts (20) 
respectively mounted within the contact mounting slots 
(101), and a plurality of conductors (30) respectively 
connected to the connecting portion of either contact 
(20). This structure of edge connector is complicated 
to manufacture. Because conductors are separately 
soldered to the contacts, it is difficult to maintain 
the quality. Figure 9 shows another structure of edge 
connector according to the prior art, in which the 
conductors (30) are respectively fastened to the 
contacts (not shown) by a respective conductor clamp 
(40). The conductor clamp (40) has a rear end 
terminated to two opposite binding strips (401;402), 
which are bent to hold down the conductor, and a front 
end terminated to a curved spring leaf (403), which  
 
fastens the circuit board. This structure of edge 
connector eliminates the process of tin soldering. 
However, fastening the conductor clamp is not an easy 
job, and a special machine is needed to do such a 
fastening work. The present invention has been accomplished 
under the aforesaid circumstances. It is therefore an 
object of the present invention to provide a metal 
contact spring plate and a conductor clamp for an edge 
connector which can be conveniently and quickly inserted 
and then positioned in either slot on the shell of the 
edge connector. It is another object of the present 
invention to provide a metal contact spring plate and a 
conductor clamp for an edge connector which can be 
conveniently mounted within either slot on the shell of 
the edge connector to hold down a conductor upon its 
insertion. It is still another object of the present 
invention to provide a shell for an edge connector which 
has horizontal slots on two opposite sides thereof 
respectively linked to vertical slots thereof for 
inserting a rod in releasing the conductor from the 
conductor clamp in either vertical slot. An embodiment of the present invention will  
 
be described by way example and with reference to the 
accompany drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is an exploded view of an edge 
connector according to the preferred embodiment of the 
present invention; Fig. 2 is a sectional

An edge connector comprising a shell 
having two symmetrical rows of vertical slots, each 

vertical slot being formed of an upper space and a lower 
space linked to said upper space, a plurality of metal 

contact spring plates respectively received in said 
vertical slots, and a plurality of conductor spring 

respectively received in the lower space of either 
vertical slot to hold down a conductor on either metal 

contact spring plate, wherein: 
   each metal contact spring plate comprises a 

bent in the middle disposed between the upper and lower 
spaces in either vertical slot, a projecting strip 

projected from said square bent and stopped above the 
lower space of the respective vertical slot, a curved 

clamping portion at one end received in the upper space 
for making an electric contact with an external 

connector, a wedge portion at an opposite end vertically 
received in the lower space of the respective vertical 

slot at one side, said wedge portion having a side 
opening and being terminated to a tail sloping in one 

direction and closely attached to a sloping edge on the 
lower space of the respective vertical slot at the 

bottom; and 
   each conductor clamp comprises a first bent 

 
and a second bent respectively stopped at two curved 

edges in two diagonal corners within the lower space of 
either vertical slot, a front end turned downwards, and 

a rear end turned upwards and passed over said front end 
and stopped against the wedge portion of the respective 

metal contact spring plate. 
The edge connector of claim 1 wherein said 
shell further comprises two rows of horizontal slots on 

two opposite sides thereof respectively linked to either 
vertical slot and aligned with the side opening on the 

wedge portion of either metal contact spring plate.
