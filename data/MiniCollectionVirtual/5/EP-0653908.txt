<ABSTRACT>
Agricultural spreaders have a pair of spinners (8) which throw powders and granules to the sides of the spreader in a progressive band. A deflector assembly made of sheet metal has a horizontal cover (2) overlying the spinners (8) with a port (6) through which the spinners are supplied with material. For each spinner there is an upright fixed front deflector (56) at the edge of the spinner to prevent material being thrown against the spreader; an upright rear adjustable deflector (50) at the edge of the spinner to prevent material being thrown to the rear of the spreader; an extension (16) of the cover lying behind the spreader wheel (40) has a series of upright, side by side deflectors (26, 30) which project into the airstream leaving the spinner. The side by side deflectors cause minimum deflection but the material does not strike the spreader (40) and build-up of powder fines is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns spread path modifiers for 
agricultural spreaders of the spinner type. Spreaders may be loaded with a variety of materials of 
different density, grain size and water content. Most 
commercial spreader material contains fines mixed with the 
lumps, pellets, granules or powder constituting the main 
weight of the material to be spread. Fines cannot be thrown as far by the spinners as the 
heavier material and these tend to be deposited in a band 
across the rear of the spreader from wheel to wheel while 
the heavier material lands toward the maximum range of the 
spinner. Thus the fines present a problem. If the material is 
granulated by dampening with water, when thrown from the 
spinners it may shatter into fines against the spreader 
vehicle and undergo minimal spreading. Even if a guard is 
provided around the rear of the vehicle, fines tend to 
stick to the guard and build-up may occur. Refinements in vehicle guidance and the metering of 
material have advanced to the stage where the performance  
 
of the spinners now lags and a patchy spread pattern is not 
acceptable. The spread path lies in a band to the left and 
right of the spinners up to 20 metres wide depending on the 
mass of the particles and spinner rpm. The contractor aims 
for minimum band overlap. The material leaves the spinners 
from all four quadrants and inevitably the material leaving 
the inner rear quadrant spreads to the rear. Material 
leaving the outer front quadrant strikes the vehicle's 
extremity. FRA 2 637 448 which discloses the features of the preamble 
of claim 1, describes a spreader with twin 
spinners. Each spinner has a 180 degree guard which protects 
the adjacent spinner. Around part of the circumference 
of each spinner there is a stationary multiple vane 
assembly which directs spreader material to the same side 
of the vehicle. The object of this invention is to deal with the material 
which strikes the spreader in the course of spreading. This invention provides a deflector assembly for an agricultural 
spreader of the type described characterised by a 
deflector capable when mounted transversely of the direction 
of travel of the spreader, of deflecting spreader material 
thrown by a spinner in the direction of the spinner 
body wherein one or more guides project uprightly into and 
substantially parallel into the path of the material 
leaving the spinner thereby modifying the path of the 
material.A main cover may overlie the spinners. The assembly 
will work without a cover but

<CLAIMS>
A deflector assembly for an agricultural spreader of 
the type having a pair of side by side spinners (8) which 

in use are top fed from a bulk material container (58) and 
wherein each spinner has a spread zone comprising a front 

inner quadrant (54); a front outer quadrant (64); a rear 
inner quadrant (52); a rear outer quadrant (62);
 
characterised by
 
a front deflector (56) adjacent the inner front quadrant of 

the spinner, a rear deflector (50) adjacent the inner rear 
quadrant of each spinner, a cover mounted at or near the 

circumference of each spinner just above the same, and a 
side by side series of side deflectors (26,30) extending 

from each cover into the path of the material leaving the 
spinner in the front outer quadrant in order to deflect the 

material from the spreader vehicle (40) into the spread 
path (66).

characterised by
 
a main cover (2) overlying the spinners and having a 

charging port (6) for each spinner in the inner front 
quadrant (54)

characterised by
 
the cover (16) which mounts the side deflectors (26,30) in  

 
the outer front quadrant is a separable extension of the 

main cover (2) 
A deflector assembly as claimed in claim 2 or 3
 
characterised in that
 
the direction of the side deflectors (26,30) lie at an 

acute angle to the path of the material leaving the spinner 
(8) in the outer front quadrant. 
A deflector as claimed in any one of claims 1-4

disposition. 
A deflector assembly as claimed in claim 5
 
characterised in that
 
two or more of the arcuate deflectors (26,30) mutually 

converge in order to accelerate part of the airstream.

lying at ninety degrees to the cover (16) 
A deflector assembly as claimed in any one of claims  
 

1-7 characterised in that
 
the side deflectors (26,30) project further at the outer 

end of the strip than at the inner end of the strip. 
A deflector assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
1-8 characterised in that
 
the cover (16) is inclined upwardly at 5-15 degrees to the 

plane of the spinner. 
A deflector assembly as claimed in any one of claims 
1-9 characterised in that
 
the side deflectors (26,30) are joined to the cover (16)
