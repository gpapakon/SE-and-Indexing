<ABSTRACT>
1. Method and device for inserting a cigarette group (11) into a supporting member (14) for positioning the cigarettes (10) at a distance from one another within the pack. 2.1. To introduce cigarettes (10) or the like into orifices (22) of the supporting member (14), guide tubes (64) serve as members for guiding the cigarettes (10), the guide tubes (64) being guided with tube tips (65) through the orifices (22) of the supporting member (14) and the cigarettes (10) then being pushed along in the guide tubes (64). 2.2. When the unit consisting of a cigarette group (11) and the supporting member (14) is pushed out of a cigarette turret (47), folding tabs of the supporting member (14) are folded.

corresponds to the number of cigarettes (10) per row (12, 
13) taking effect in each filling station (54, 55). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the cigarettes (10)

Apparatus according to Claim 6 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the bridge (61, 62)

(63), which are assigned to the guide tubes (64) and 

which are arranged in the extension of the guide tubes  
 

(64) and, in a receiving position of the bridge (61, 62), 
run underneath magazine shafts (57) of the cigarette 

magazine (56), in such a way that the particular lower 
cigarette (10) of a magazine shaft (57) passes into a 

trough (63) provided. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the guide tubes are 

assigned push members, especially tappets (60), which are 
dimensioned in such a way that they can be moved through

cigarettes (10), whilst the ta
ppets (60) displace the 
cigarettes (10), received by the troughs (63), in the 

region of the bridge (61, 62) into the guide tubes (64)
