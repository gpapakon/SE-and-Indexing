<ABSTRACT>
In order to effectively protect an integrated 
circuit (IC) against electrostatic discharge, a diode 

clamp is coupled across an internal IC circuit element 
which is to be protected from damage by electrostatic 

discharge. The diode clamp is arranged such that a 
forward current direction thereof is the same as a 

forward direction of the circuit element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
improvements in an integrated circuit, and more 
specifically to an integrated circuit having a diode 
voltage clamp via which damage by electrostatic discharge 
is effectively prevented without adversely affecting 
normal circuit operations. As is well known in the art, an integrated circuit 
is extremely susceptible to electrostatic discharge 
during handling. A human body is equivalent to 100pF in 
series with 1.5kÎ©, by way of example. In winter the 
capacitor of a human body may charge to a few kilovolts 
with a simple arm motion with shirt or sweater. However, 
once a semiconductor device is safely set to its circuit, 
the chances for damages by electrostatic discharge are 
greatly reduced. Before turning to the present invention it is deemed 
advantageous to briefly discuss, with reference to Fig. 
1, a known integrated circuit which is provided with 
measures of safety for preventing irreversible damage by 
electrostatic discharge. The arrangement of Fig. 1 is 
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 
63-72146. In Fig. 1, a bipolar type integrated circuit 
includes two output transistors Q1 and Q2 arranged in 
series between a power source terminal Vcc and a ground 
terminal G. The transistor Q1 is of an emitter follower 
type in this particular case. A junction J1 between the 
transistors Q1 and Q2 is coupled to an output terminal 
Tout. The integrated circuit of Fig. 1 further includes  
 
transistors Q3 and Q4 which form a differential amplifier 
together with two resistors R1 and R2. A transistor Q5 
functions as a constant current source. Each of the 
bases of the transistors Q2 and Q3-Q5 are coupled to 
internal circuitry (not shown) of the integrated circuit 
of Fig. 1. In order to prevent the output transistors Q1 and Q2 
from being irreversibly damaged by static electricity 
discharged into the output terminal Tout, two diodes D1 
and D2 are provided in series between the terminal Vcc 
and the ground terminal G. A junction J2 between the 
diode D1 and D2 is connected to the output terminal Tout. If a static voltage discharged into the output 
terminal Tout is positive, the diode D1 is rendered 
conductive whereby a current bypath is established for 
the transistor Q1. Thus, the transistor Q1 is protected 
from being damaged by electrostatic discharge. 
Contrarily, if a static voltage discharged into the 
output terminal Tout is negative, the diode D2 is in turn 
rendered conductive and provides a bypass for the 
transistor Q2.
