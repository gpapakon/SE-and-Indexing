<ABSTRACT>
In this chuck, the body (2) is equipped, in its zone covered by the sleeve, with a peripheral toothing (15), whereas the sleeve includes a shaped locking member (14) which, intended to be engaged in the toothing (15) of the body in the closed position of the chuck, is actuated by a ring (16) mounted so that it can pivot on the front end of the body of the chuck.

A tool-carrying arbor for equipping a rotary 
machine, such as a drilling machine, of the type comprising 

a body (2) fixed on the drive shaft of the machine and in 
which are mounted a plurality of jaws (7) sliding in bores 

and converging towards the front, the body being integral, 
at its rear part, with an immobilising ring (5), in front 

of which there is mounted pivotally on the body a casing 
(13) the internal wall of which is integral with a nut (9) 

engaged with the outer threaded parts of the jaws, 
characterised in that the body (2) is provided with 

peripheral teeth (15) in its area covered by the casing, 
while the casing comprises a shaped locking member (14) 

which, designed for engagement in the teeth (15) on the 
body when the arbor is in the clamping position, is 

actuated by a ring (16) mounted pivotally on the front end 
of the arbor body. 
An arbor according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the teeth (15) formed in the body (2) are spur teeth, 

while the locking member (14) consists of a flat spring, 
the free end of which is inclined with respect to a line 

perpendicular to the teeth when no force is exerted on it. 
An arbor according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the flat spring (14) projects inwards in a hollowed-out 

portion of the casing (13) in which there is 
displaceably arranged a shaped tongue (25), integral with 

the ring (16), which is designed, in an angular end 
position, to rest against the spring (14) to disengage the 

latter from the teeth. 
An arbor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the casing (13) comprises, opening in 

its front-facing face, a plurality of recesses (19) centred 
on the arbor axis and inside each of which there is engaged 

a finger (23) which, integral with the ring, is of shorter 
length than the corresponding recess, this length being 

determined in the direction of the arc along which this 
recess extends.  

 
An arbor according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the casing (13) comprises, in its part facing the 

ring, a resilient tongue the free end of which is provided 
with a shaped portion (27), while the ring (16) comprises 

two notches (28) which are spaced from each other by a 
value equal to the rotational travel of the ring (16) with 

respect to the casing (13), that is to say to the 
difference in length between a recess in the casing and the 

corresponding finger of the ring, and are designed to 
accommodate the shaped portion (27) in the two ring travel 

end positions. 
An arbor according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the ring (16) is disposed at the end 

of the casing (13), with their opposing ends interlocking. 
An arbor according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the ring (16) comprises a tubular extension (17) 

covering the casing (13) over a large portion of its 
length. 
An arbor according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that the body (2) comprises, in the 
vicinity of its front end, an annular groove (29) defined, 

towards the front end of the body, by a surface (30) 
substantially perpendicular to the axis of the arbor, while 

the ring (16) comprises a conical flange (32) engaged in 
the groove (29) in the body when the arbor is in the 

assembled position. 
An arbor according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the body (2) comprises, in the 

vicinity of its front end, an annular groove (29) defined, 
towards the front end of the body, by a surface (30) 

substantially perpendicular to the axis of the arbor, while 
the ring (16) comprises, at its front end, a plurality of 

resilient tongues (33) designed for engagement in the 
groove (29) in the body when the arbor is in the assembled 

position.
