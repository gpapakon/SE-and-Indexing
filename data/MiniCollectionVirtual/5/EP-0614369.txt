<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to dipeptide polymer
pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof, in
particular, uses thereof for treatment of
immunodepressed states and of opportunistic
infections in immunodepressed states.Several polypeptides found in the thymus gland
have been implicated as playing roles in the
development and maintenance of immunological
competence in animals, including human beings. Some
of these polypeptides have been shown to stimulate
the maturation, differentiation and function of T-cells.
For example, a heat-stable fraction isolated
from calf thymus extracts, designated as Thymosin
fraction 5, has been shown to reconstitute immune
functions in thymic-deprived or immunodepressed
individuals. Several peptides have been isolated
from Thymosin fraction 5, such as Thymosin alpha1 (28
amino acids, U.S. Patent No. 4,079,127), Thymosin
beta4 (44 amino acids, Low et al., PNAS, 78,1162-1166
(1981)), Thymosin betas (39 amino acids, U.S. Patent
No. 4,389,343) and Thymosin beta9 (41 amino acids,
U.S. Patent No. 4,389,343). However, practical
administration of such polypeptides is expensive due 
to the relatively low yield and complexity of
isolation and/or manufacture of such long chain
polypeptides. Most importantly, in some cases, these
polypeptides produce side reactions in patients.A dipeptide Glu-Trp, hereinafter referred to
as Thymogen, exhibits a broad range of efficacy for
prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections
in immunodepressed states, and for therapeutically
effective treatment of immunodeficient states. This
is believed to be highly unexpected for such a
relatively small compound to exhibit such a broad
range of activity. Furthermore, we have not found
any significant side effects from the use of the
dipeptide according to the present invention. Due to
its simple nature, the dipeptide is rather
inexpensive to manufacture. EP-A-0346501 also discloses the
above dipeptide and its use in the treatment of immune-deficient states.AS used herein, the terms "immunomodulator" and
"immunomodulating" encompass the activity of
enhancing or restoring the subject's immune system,
as evidenced by measurable blood parameters and/or
the patient's improved ability to combat infection or
disease, and the ability to heal tissue. Hence,
immunomodulation encompasses improvement of the
immune system due to an immunodeficient state (for
example, caused by removal of the thymus), and/or an
immunodepressed state (for example, caused by
exposure to radiation). Furthermore, the present
