<ABSTRACT>
A single-use camera (1) comprises a camera inner 
body (3) which light-tightly contains a photographic film and 

has a non-opaque portion (13) that includes an integrally 
formed viewfinder lens for viewing a subject to be 

photographed, and an outer opaque decorative casing (5) 
having an opening for the viewfinder lens (13). According to 

the invention, the inner body supports an indicator lamp (37) 
for providing illumination to visibly indicate a camera-related 

condition, and the non-opaque portion includes an 
integrally formed light pipe (51) longitudinally extending 

between the indicator lamp and the viewfinder lens for 
transmitting illumination from the indicator lamp towards 

the viewfinder lens to be observed when looking through 
the viewfinder lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned 
copending application Serial No. 08/004870, entitled 
PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM PACKAGE WITH ANTI-REFLECTION SUBSTANCE 
FOR VIEWFINDER and filed January 19, 1993 in the name of 
Alan V. VanDeMoere. This invention relates generally to the field 
of photography, and more particularly to single-use or 
disposable cameras. Specifically, the invention relates 
to a single-use camera with an indicator lamp whose 
illumination is visible via a light pipe in the camera 
viewfinder. Single-use or disposable cameras have become 
well known. Generally, each single-use camera is a 
point-and-shoot type that comprises a camera inner body 
and a paper-cardboard outer packaging or casing that 
tightly encases the inner body. The inner body houses or 
supports the various camera components such as a fixed-focus 
taking lens, a film advance and metering mechanism, 
a shutter, a simple see-through viewfinder, a frame or 
exposure counter, a manual film advance thumbwheel, etc. 
The outer packaging has respective openings for the 
taking lens, the viewfinder, the frame counter, the 
thumbwheel, and a manual release for the shutter. At the 
manufacturer, the camera body is loaded with a 
conventional 35 mm film cartridge, and substantially the 
entire length of the unexposed filmstrip is factory pre-wound 
from the cartridge into a supply chamber of the 
camera body. After the photographer takes a picture, the 
thumbwheel is manually rotated to rewind the exposed 
frame into the cartridge. The rewinding movement of the 
filmstrip the equivalent of one frame rotates a metering 
sprocket to decrement the frame counter to its next 
numbered setting. When the filmstrip is fully exposed  
 
and completely rewound into the cartridge, the single-use 
camera is sent to a photofinisher who processes the 
filmstrip to make photographic prints and recycles 
certain camera parts. Prior art U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,866, issued Mar. 
14, 1989, discloses a single-use camera comprising an 
opaque main body section pre-loaded with a roll film and 
including the shutter and the taking lens, an opaque back 
cover section attached to the rear of the main body 
section to light-tightly shield the film, and a 
transparent front cover section attached to the front of 
the main body section and having an integral single-element 
taking lens or an integral single-element finder 
lens. A cardboard opaque box tightly encases the main 
body section and the front and rear cover sections, and 
has a front opening for the

<CLAIMS>
A single-use camera comprising a camera 
inner body which light-tightly contains a photographic 

film and has a non-opaque portion that includes an 
integrally formed viewfinder lens for viewing a subject 

to be photographed, and an outer opaque decorative casing 
having an opening for said viewfinder lens, is 

characterized in that: 
   said inner body supports an indicator lamp for 

providing illumination to visibly indicate a camera-related 
condition; and 

   said non-opaque portion includes an integrally 
formed light pipe longitudinally extending between said 

indicator lamp and said viewfinder lens for transmitting 
illumination from the indicator lamp towards the 

viewfinder lens to be observed when looking through the 
viewfinder lens. 
A single-use camera as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said inner body and said outer casing have 

respective aligned openings located close to said 
indicator lamp to view illumination provided by the 

indicator lamp without looking through said viewfinder 
lens. 
A single-use camera as recited in claim 1, 
wherein the inside of said outer casing is coated with a 

light-absorbent substance at least in the vicinity of 
said light pipe to prevent ambient light received through 

said viewfinder lens from reflecting off said inside onto 
the light pipe. 
A single-use camera as recited in claim 3, 
wherein said light-absorbent substance is dull black to 

reflect little or no ambient light. 
A single-use camera as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said non-opaque portion is translucent except for 

said viewfinder lens and said light pipe.
