<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended for the supply of a preselectable dose of a liquid medicament. It essentially comprises a cylinder (1, 2) with a left-hand cylinder member (1) and a right-hand cylinder member (2), as well as a double-acting piston pump (4, 5) displaceably arranged therein and comprising a left-hand piston member (4) and a right-hand piston member (5) with means (6) for positive and/or non-positive coupling to a drive unit (15). The device is passively controlled by two self-locking inlet valves (7, 8) and outlet valves (11, 12). It is thereby possible to produce a continuous flow of liquid medicament (20) from the medicament container (10).

Device for administering doses of liquid medicine of predetermined quantity with a
medicine container (10), whereby the device comprises


A) a cylinder (1;2) with a left cylinder section (1) and a right cylinder section (2), a
double-ended piston (4;5) arranged displaceable therein and having a left piston section

(4) and a right piston section (5) with means (6) for coupling by means of positive
locking and/or friction connection to a drive unit (15), whereby the left piston section (4)

and the right piston section (5) are mutually rigidly connected by means of a piston rod
(3) and both piston sections (4;5) are arranged displaceable in same direction within the

two cylinder sections (1;2);
B) a left intake valve (7) for said left cylinder section (1 ) and a right intake valve (8) for
said right cylinder section (2) whereby said intake valves (7;8) being connectable by an

intake line (9) to a medicine container (10); and
C) a left discharge valve (11) for the left cylinder section (1), and a right discharge valve
(12) for the right cylinder section (2), whereby said discharge valves (11;12) supplying

the liquid medicine through a discharge line (13),

characterized in that

D) said intake valves (7;8) and said discharge valves (11;12) acting self-closing due to a
rubber initial tension generated through a slight oversizing of the elastic valve material

therewith being passively controllable solely through hydraulic pressure, respectively
depression of the liquid medicine.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said means (6) for coupling to a
drive unit (15) by means of positive locking and/or frictional connection being attached

to the piston rod (3).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said means (6) for coupling to
a drive unit (15) by means of positive locking and/or frictional connection attached to the

piston rod (3) consist of a drive disk (61). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said means (6) for coupling to
a drive unit (15) by means of frictional connection comprise a non-rotatable spindle

(63) having an external thread being encompassed by a axially fixed gear (62) having
an internal thread.
Device according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterized in that the members (1-13)
being composed to a pump unit (14), which is loosenably connectable to a drive unit

(15).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the pump unit (14) consists of
injection-moulded synthetic parts.
Device according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterized in that it is irreversibly
securable against a patient's removal of liquid medicine (20) from said medicine

container (10) by means of a snap-on cap (18).
