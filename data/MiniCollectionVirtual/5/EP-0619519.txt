<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that aromatic diazonium salts are the most 
widely used photosensitive compounds for the production of 
lithographic plates. To improve their properties, many condensation products of 
photosensitive aromatic diazonium compounds have been prepared 
from various compounds with the intent of obtaining high 
molecular weight compounds containing aromatic diazonium 
groups. All these condensation reactions have been carried out in 
the presence of a mineral acid or strong organic acid such as 
sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrofluoric acid, 
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 
toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid and ethanesulfonic 
acid. Generally, these studies had the aim of identifying the 
starting compounds which yield the best condensation products. 
However, as far as it is known, the importance of the role 
played by the nature of the condensation acid medium on the 
nature of the condensation products has never been understood. US-A-3,849,392 (Kalle A.G.) discloses a process for 
preparing photosensitive compounds which comprises 
polycondensing, in a strongly acidic medium, 1 unit of an 
aromatic diazonium compound with from 0.1 to 50 units of an 
aromatic compound having from 1 to 10 aliphatic alkoxy or 
acyloxy groups. Typical examples of strong acids are sulphuric 
acid, phosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid (column 9, line  
 
20). In this patent it is also stated that in order to yield 
good, results the polycondensation compounds must have a weight 
of from 500 to 10,000 (see col. 11, lines 29-32). This range is very wide and the inventor does not specify 
whether he refers to the average weight or, especially as far 
as the upper limit of the range is concerned, to the weight of 
a minimum fraction. Similarly, the inventor does not teach how it is possible to 
prepare polycondensation compounds having an average molecular 
weight greater than 3,000. In fact, the only example wherein the mean molecular weight 
of the polycondensation products has been mentioned is Example 
42. Specifically, this example relates to the preparation of 
two polycondensation products which yield, with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone, 
a dyestuff having an mean molecular weight 
of 3,180 and, respectively, 2,390, which corresponds to an mean 
weight of the polycondensation product of about 2,900 and 2150, 
respectively. US-A-3,867,147 (Am. Hoechst Corp.) relates to 
polycondensation products prepared according to the method 
described in the previous patent
