A method and a device for the mechanical removal of the coating and/or skin of block-shaped or rod-shaped food products (1) is described, a tip of the product being partly cut off, taken hold of together with the coating and/or skin and fixed to a winding shaft (14, 15). Then, under the simultaneous action of a skin-cutting knife (5) the coating and/or skin is pulled off in strips, with rotation and longitudinal displacement of the food product, and wound onto a winding shaft.
