<ABSTRACT>
A rasp hub assembly for use in a tire buffing machine is 
disclosed. The hub assembly includes two end plates (30), and a 

set of tire rasp blades (20) and spacers (10) arranged in 
alternating circumferential rows. The blades and spacers have 

conforming nonplanar elongated bodies, with the blades nested with 
adjacent spacers. The resulting rasp hub assembly allows the use 

of an even or odd number of rasp blades in each row, and provides 
various benefits further described in the specification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rasp hub assembly
according to the precharacterising portion of claim 1
for use in tire buffing machines. More particularly, it relates to
a tire rasp hub assembly which incorporates nonplanar or
"bent" spacers with nonplanar or "bent" rasp blades; see e.g.U.S. Patent Nos. 5,033,175, 4,019,234 and
2,703,446.Tire buffing machines are well known in the tire retreading
industry. Conventionally, a tire buffing machine includes both a
structure for mounting a used tire and a rasp hub which removes the
worn tread from the used tire prior to the retreading process. The
used tire is rotated while it is held against the rapidly rotating
rasp hub whose outside perimeter is provided with a multitude of
tire rasp blades. When so engaged against the used tire, the rasp
blades cut or shear small segments of rubber from the worn tread
surface area of the tire. In this way, the tire is "buffed" to
remove the unwanted used tread and to achieve an evenly textured
surface suitable for retreading.Tire rasp blades, together with intervening spacers, are
assembled on the periphery of the rasp hub between the hub front
and back plates. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,703,446 and 4,019,234 disclose
such conventional prior art rasp hub assemblies wherein the back
plate of the hub has axially directed support pins for mounting the 
rasp blades and spacers. The front plate is then placed on the
support pins against the assembled blades and spacers and locked
into place.Use of bent tire rasp blades with flat spacers is described in
U.S. Patent No. 5,033,175. This arrangement creates a
circumferentially interlocked hub with less potential for
mechanical failure at high rotational speeds. The tire buffing
machine hub assembly disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,033,175 has
proven generally satisfactory. However, in this assembly two
separate planar spacers are associated with and overlap each rasp
blade. A one-for-one correspondence and positioning of spacers and
blades, together with a spacer configuration which facilitates the
proper location of the blades, would allow the hub assembly to be
assembled more quickly and easily. Additionally, conventional rasp
hub assemblies (as shown, for example, in FIGURE 9), do not allow
the use of an odd number of the bent blades disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,033,175 with a conventional hub, since conventional
hubs employ only an even number of angled surfaces or sections and
each such blade covers two angled surfaces. The closest prior art according to US-A 5 033 175
