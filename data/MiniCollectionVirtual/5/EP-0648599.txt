<ABSTRACT>
The device for loading a pressing band in a machine for the fabrication of corrugated cardboard comprises one or more lower, heating press beds (bedplates) (4) over the surface of which there moves a strip of corrugated cardboard (5), the upper covering paper strip (22) of which is deposited on the corrugations (21) which have previously been pasted, a pressing band (3) moving at the same linear speed as the corrugated cardboard strip (5) bearing on the covering paper strip (22) and loading members (1) of the pressing band (3) acting on the pressing band (3). The loading members of the pressing band (3) consist of elements permitting the diffusion through them of the moisture contained in the corrugated cardboard strip (5) and these various elements are produced so as to permit adjustment of their pressure force on the upper face of the lower strand of the pressing band (3).

Device for loading an endless pressure belt (3) located in a 
corrugated board manufacturing machine, that includes one or several 

lower heating plates (4) on the surface of which travels a corrugated board 
web (5) whose upper cover paper web (22) has just been applied on the 

pre-glued corrugations (21), the pressure belt (3) which travels at the same 
linear speed as the corrugated board web (5) and presses onto the cover 

paper web (22), as well as organs (1) for loading the pressure belt (3), the 
latter organs having to act on the pressure belt (3), characterized by the 

fact that the organs (1) for loading the pressure belt (3) consist solely of 
elements that permit, through them, the removal of humidity residing in the 

corrugated board web (5) and by the fact that these different elements are 
realized so as to allow the adjustment of their pressure force on the upper 

face of the lower side of the pressure belt (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the elements that permit, through them, the removal of humidity residing in 

the corrugated board web (5) consist of at least a crosswise bar (23), fitted 
so as to be able to pivot and to be locked in position between two lateral 

frames (6, 7) and of at least a brush (26, 28 to 28b, 29, 30, 31). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the brush (26) is fitted to the crosswise bar (23) which is attached to 

pivoting levers (24, 25), and by the fact that the brush (26) has a length 
equal to the one of the crosswise bar (23). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the brushes (28 to 28b) are linked to a crosswise pvivoting beam (27) by 

means of an elastic blade (8), by the fact that the brushes (28 to 28b) have 
different lengths and by the fact that the crosswise beam (27) is equipped 

with a stopping (9, 10) and locking device in order to limit its downward 
rotation.  

 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the brushes (29) are fitted so as to be able to slide vertically in a tubular 

beam (12) containing an expandable chamber (13) which acts on the upper 
side of the brush (29) under the action of a fluid, the tubular beam (12) 

being rigidly linked to the crosswise beam (27). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the brushes (30) are fitted in a frame (14) which can move vertically in a 

cradle (31) which is rigidly fitted on the lateral frames (6, 7) by means of 
fastening clips (33, 34), the said cradle (31) being equipped with an 

expandable chamber (13) which acts on the upper side of the frame (14) 
under the action of a fluid. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that 
the brushes (30) are arranged in a checkerboard pattern onto crosswise 

bars (37) of the frame (14) and that they are linked to these crosswise bars 
(37) by means of elastic blades (40). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the one or the other of the elements that permit, through them, the removal 

of humidity residing in the corrugated board web (5) may selectively be 
rendered inoperative. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the pressure exerted by every element that permit, through them, the 

removal of humidity residing in the corrugated board web (5) may be 
adjusted collectively or individually.
