<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiographic apparatus having a photoconductor (1) for converting X-radiation into a charge pattern, and having a corona charging system (3) for charging the surface of the photoconductor to a defined potential before taking a radiograph (X-ray photograph). Deposits of dust on the corona charging system and the artefacts associated therewith in the X-ray photograph are avoided in this case by providing a control unit (6) for operating the corona charging system in a charging mode and in a cleaning mode. In the charging mode, a first voltage (U1), and in the cleaning mode a second voltage (U2) of a polarity which is - at least for a time - opposite to that of the first voltage is applied to the corona charging system.

<CLAIMS>
An X-ray apparatus, comprising a photoconductor (1) for converting X-rays 
into a charge pattern, and a corona charging device (3) for charging the surface of 

the photoconductor to a defined potential prior to an X-ray exposure, 

characterized in that
 there is provided a control unit (6) for operating the corona 
charging device (3) in a first mode and in a second mode, the corona charging device 

(3) receiving in the first mode a first voltage (U1) and in the second mode a second 
voltage (U2) of a polarity which opposes that of the first voltage at least temporarily. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 there is 
provided a first direct voltage source (7) which is connected to the corona charging 

device (3) in the first mode, and a second direct voltage source (5) which is connected 
to the corona charging device (3) in the second mode, the voltage supplied by the 

second direct voltage source having a polarity opposing that of and being smaller than 
the voltage supplied by the first voltage source. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, 

characterized in that
 the photoconductor (1) comprises a photoconductor layer (1b) on 
an electrically conductive carrier (la), said carrier (la) being connected to the second 

direct voltage source (5). 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
control unit (6) comprises a switching device (64) which is connected between a direct 

voltage source (7) and the corona charging device and supplies the corona charging 
device (3) with the voltage supplied by the direct voltage source in the first mode with a 

first polarity and supplies this voltage with a polarity opposing the first polarity in the 
second mode. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 there is provided a direct voltage source which is connected to the 
corona charging device in the first mode, and that there is also provided an alternating 

voltage source which is connected to the corona charging device in the second mode. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims,  
 


characterized in that
 operation in the first mode is always followed by operation in the 
second mode. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 the duration of operation in the second mode is approximately 
equal to the duration of operation in the first mode. 
An X-ray apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 at least one conductive surface (51, 71) is provided in the vicinity 
of the photoconductor (1), outside the corona discharging device, which conductive 

surface is connected to a direct voltage source.
