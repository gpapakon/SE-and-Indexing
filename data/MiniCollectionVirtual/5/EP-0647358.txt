<ABSTRACT>
A stripline or microstrip feed system (10) distributes electromagnetic power among a set of utilization devices such as radiators (22) of an array antenna. In the feed system, elongated assemblies of microwave couplers (38) are arranged side by side to provide for a two-dimensional array of couplers corresponding to a two-dimensional array of radiators in rows and columns of an array antenna, and providing beam steering perpendicular to the rows. Each coupler assembly comprises different forms of couplers for providing both an amplitude and phase taper for the radiation radiating from each row of radiators. The couplers include a Wilkenson coupler (44), a hybrid coupler (46), and a backward wave coupler (48) which serve as power dividers during transmission. The couplers (44, 46, 48) are connected in series, and wherein a particular coupler has a first output terminal (e.g. T2) coupled to an input terminal (T1) of a next coupler while a second output terminal (e.g. T3) of the particular coupler is connected to a radiator of the antenna array. Each coupler assembly has a main conductor (60) which interconnects the couplers to provide a configuration having a narrow width which is less than approximately one free-space wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the distribution, or
feeding, of electromagnetic power from a source of the
power to an array of power utilization devices, such as
radiators of an array antenna and, more particularly, to
the feeding of power by a planar system of rows and columns
of microwave couplers at a fixed frequency or frequency
band allowing for a steering of a beam of radiation from
the array antenna in one plane, perpendicular to a plane of
the radiators of the antenna, while allowing for
differential phase shift and amplitude to signals applied
to adjacent radiators by the feed assembly.A two-dimensional array antenna may be described in
terms of an XYZ coordinate axes system having an X axis, a
Y axis and a Z axis which are orthogonal to each other,
wherein the radiators are arranged in rows along the Y
direction and in columns along the X direction. It is
common practice to construct the antenna with control
circuitry for controlling the amplitude and the phase of
the signal radiated by each radiator, the control circuitry
including, by way of example, an electronically controlled
phase shifter and an electronically controlled attenuator
or amplifier. The control circuitry extends in the Z
direction, perpendicular to the plane of the radiators and
the radiating aperture of the antenna. To insure a
well-formed beam without excessive grating lobes, the
spacing between the radiators, on centers, and the
corresponding spacing between the control circuits is less
than approximately one free-space wavelength of the
electromagnetic radiation radiated by the radiators, for
example, less than or equal to 0.9 wavelengths for a beam
of radiation which remains stationary relative to the
antenna. However, for an antenna which is to provide a
scanning of a beam relative to the antenna, the spacing
normally is less than one wavelength but greater than or 
equal to one-half wavelength along a coordinate axis for
which the beam is to be scanned.A problem arises in that the foregoing control
circuitry may have excessive weight and physical size for
some antenna applications, particularly for antennas which
provide a scanning capacity along one or two coordinate
axes. For array antennas providing only a stationary beam
or a beam which is to be steered in only one of the
coordinate directions, X or Y, a planar configuration of a
radiator feed system is preferred to reduce both size and
weight of the antenna. Planar feed systems have been
built, such as a set of parallel waveguides disposed side
by side, and having a
