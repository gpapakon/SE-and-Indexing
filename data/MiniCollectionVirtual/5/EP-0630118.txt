<ABSTRACT>
In a radio local area network in which the output power for any 
transmitter/receiver station is limited to a specified maximum equivalent isotropically 

radiated power (EIRP), two or more of the transmitter/receiver stations may have 
separate transmitter and receiver antennae, the receiver antennae being directional high 

gain antennae such that the range at which two such stations can communicate is 
correspondingly greater than for stations using omnidirectional receive antennae.

<DESCRIPTION>
Radio, or wireless, local area networks are being developed for linking together 
small computers within a building or other defined small area, or linking small 
computers to a central facility, without the need for dedicated wiring. The regulations governing the radio frequencies to be used for such networks 
limit the maximum transmitted power density to avoid interference between adjacent 
networks. For example, for the frequency bid from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz it is proposed 
to limit the maximum output power to 100mW equivalent isotropically radiated power 
(EIRP). In a typical office environment this may result in a "worst-case" reliable 
range of 50 metres. According to one aspect of the present invention in a radio local area network 
system at least two transmitter/receiver arrangements each have separate transmitter 
and receiver antennae, the respective receiver antennae being high gain antennae 
whereby the range between said two transmitter/receiver arrangements may be 
increased. The receiver antennae may be dish antennae. According to another aspect of the present invention a transmitter/receiver 
arrangement for a radio local area network system has separate transmitter and 
receiver antennae, the receiver antenna being a high gain directional antenna. The receiver antenna may be a dish antenna. According to another aspect of the present invention a long range link for a 
radio local area network comprises two transmitter/receiver arrangements each having 
separate transmitter and receiver antennae, the respective receiver antennae being high 
gain directional antennae capable of being aimed towards the transmitter antennae of  
 
the respective opposite transmitter/receiver arrangements. Part of a radio local area network in accordance with the present invention is 
illustrated in the accompanying drawing, which shows schematically a pair of 
transmitter/receiver arrangements each having a directional receiver antenna. Referring to the drawing each of a pair of transmitter/receivers 1 has an 
omnidirectional transmitter antenna 2 and a directional receiver antenna 3, which may 
for example be a dish antenna as indicated. The use of such directional antennae 
enables the establishment of a long-range link in what is essentially a system providing 
short range links, the two directional receiver antennae 3 being able to pick up usable 
signals at greater range than omnidirectional antennae. For example, if a dish antenna 
of 10cm radius is provided for the receivers at either end of a link a
