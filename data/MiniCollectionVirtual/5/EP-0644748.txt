<ABSTRACT>
A spacer for use in a disposable absorbent article. The spacer is symmetric about a longitudinal axis and has two transversely oriented springs generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis. The transversely oriented springs have different spring rates, so that transverse compression caused by the wearer's thighs may be readily accommodated, yet the spacer remains open to receive fecal material. The spacer may be advantageously used in a disposable absorbent article having a void space between the topsheet and the core, and maintain this void space under the weight of the wearer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spacer for use in disposable 
absorbent articles, particularly to spacers for use in disposable 
absorbent articles which isolate fecal material from the wearer, and more 
particularly to spacers for use in disposable absorbent articles having a 
void space for receiving the fetal material, wherein the void space is 
maintained by such a spacer. The present invention also relates to 
disposable absorbent articles having such spacers. Disposable absorbent articles are well known in the art. Disposable 
absorbent articles are used to absorb and retain urine and fecal 
material. A particularly desired feature of disposable absorbent 
articles is the capability to minimize the task of cleaning of fetal 
material which is present on the wearer's skin after the soiled 
disposable absorbent article is removed from the wearer. In order to 
achieve this end, and to minimize epidermal contact and the associated 
irritation caused by the fetal material, attempts have been made to 
confine the fetal material to limited portions of the disposable 
absorbent article. Selected teachings in the art disclose a cavity or cutout in the 
absorbent core to receive the fetal material. The fetal material passes 
through the topsheet and is received by the material removed from or 
otherwise displaced from the absorbent core (such as through 
compression). However, these references suffer from the drawback that a 
cavity in the core or a removal of material from the core decreases its 
absorbent capacity. The cavity is limited in volume by the size of the 
core. Furthermore, the cavity may not remain registered with the anal  
 
opening. Examples of such teachings include U.S. Patent 2,043,325 issued 
June 9, 1936 to Jackson, Jr., U.S. Patent 4,731,065 issued March 15, 1988 
to Yamada, U.S. Patent 4,834,737 issued May 30, 1989 to Khan, and U.S. 
Patent 5,062,840 issued November 5, 1991 to Holt et al.  
 
FR 2 495 899 teaches a disposable diaper having a cavity comprising a 
cushion of air which is glued to an impermeable film. The cavity permits 
the storage of faecal material while a spongy mass stores the urine.  
 One attempt to minimize the task of cleaning of fecal material from 
the skin of the wearer is to provide a void space In the disposable 
absorbent article to receive the fecal material and to isolate it from 
the skin of the wearer. Typically, the void space is intermediate the 
topsheet which contacts the skin of the wearer and the absorbent core 
which absorbs fluid

said spacer (54) comprises two springs having a resistance to deflection in 

a direction generally orthogonal to said longitudinal axis (LL), each said 
spring having a spring rate in said direction which is unequal to the spring 

rate of said other spring. 
A spacer (54) according to claim 1 wherein said spring rates are 
provided by having said spacer (54) with two radii of curvature, one said 

radius of curvature being greater than the other said radius of curvature.  
 
A spacer (54) according to Claims 1 and 2 characterized in that the shape 
of said spacer (54) comprises a generally closed figure.

said longitudinal axis (LL) and registered with said aperture (46)
 
characterised in that 
said spacer (54) comprises two springs, each of said springs having a 
different spring rate in a direction generally orthogonal said longitudinal 

axis (LL), said spring oriented towards said rear waist margin (34) having a 
greater spring rate than said spring oriented towards said front waist 

margin (32). 
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to claim 5 wherein 
shape of said spacer (54) defines two transverse spans (56), a larger 

transverse span (56) and a smaller transverse span (56), said spacer (54) is 
oriented so that said larger transverse span (56) is disposed towards said 

rear waist margin (34) and said smaller transverse span (56) is disposed 
towards said front waist margin (32). 
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to Claims 5 and 6 
characterized in that said core (26) comprises an upper layer (26U) joined to 

said topsheet (22) and a lower layer (26L) joined to said backsheet, (24) and said 
space (54) is joined to one of said upper layer (26U) and said lower layer (26L) in  

 
a disposition intermediate said upper layer (26U) and said lower layer, (26L) 

and
 
preferably said upper layer (26U) and said lower layer (26L) have a space there-between 

of at least 0.6 centimeters when said spacer (54) is under a 
pressure of 1,400 kilograms per square meter. 
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to Claim 5, 6 and 7 
characterized in that said spacer (54) is selected from the group 

consisting of foam, rubber, twisted cellulosic fibers, and fluid 
stable aggregates, and
 
preferably said spacer (54) comprises high internal phase emulsion foam. 
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to Claims 5, 6, 7 and 8
