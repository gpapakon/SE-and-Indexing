<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 4-fluorobiphenyl 
derivative of formula (I), which is useful as a 
cholesterol lowering agent or a lipid lowering agent 
because of its strong inhibitory effect on a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme 
A reductase (hereinafter referred 
to as HMG-CoA reductase) thereof: 
wherein 
A is a ω-oxycarbonyldihydroxybutyl group of 
formula (II): 
   wherein 
R² is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having  
 
1 to 6 carbon atoms, which may have a substituent, 
an alkaline metal or an alkaline earth metal; or
 
a tetrahydropyranyl group of formula (III): 
R¹ is an alkyl group having 1 to 6, substituted with a 
heteroaromatic group, an alkoxyalkyl group, or a 
hydroxyalkyl group. ML-236B (Mevastatin) has been discovered in the form 
of a fungal metabolite, which is a compound capable of 
lowering the concentration of cholesterol in the blood, 
which is considered to be a prominent factor for causing 
arteriosclerosis (refer to Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application 50-155690). ML-236B, however, has not yet 
been clinically used. The effect of lowering the concentration of 
cholesterol in the blood exhibited by ML-236B is based on 
its competitive inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase 
which serves as a rate-determining enzyme for the 
biosynthesis of cholesterol. ML-236B is a compound constructed in such a manner 
that a hexahydronaphthalene skeleton is bonded to the ω-position  
 
of 3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid, and it is 
understood that the 3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic moiety is an 
indispensable moiety for the generation of the inhibitory 
effect on the HMG-CoA Reductase. After the discovery of ML-236B, compounds such as 
pravastatin (refer to Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application 57-2240), simvastatin (refer to U.S. Patent 
4,444,784)) and lovastatin (refer to U.S. Patent 
4,231,938) have been discovered and are used clinically 
in practice. These compounds are considered as such 
compounds that substituents of the hexahydronaphthalene 
ring of ML-236B are partially modified biochemically or 
chemically. Furthermore, varieties of compounds have been 
synthesized in an attempt to obtain compounds having 
higher HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory effect than those of 
drugs such as pravastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin, 
for instance, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application 56-45470, U.S. Patent 4,375,475, Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Application 58-8076, U.S. Patent 
4,459,422, U.S. Patent 4,710,513, U.S. Patent 4,567,289, 
U.S. Patent 4,812,583, and German Laid-Open
