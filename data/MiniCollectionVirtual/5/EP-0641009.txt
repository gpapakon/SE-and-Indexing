<ABSTRACT>
A shadow mask (26) of a color cathode ray tube has 
a large number of electron beam apertures (12) through 

which electron beams emitted from the electron gun pass. 
Each of the electron beam apertures has a larger opening 

(42) open to a surface of the shadow mask on a phosphor 
screen side, and a smaller opening (40) open to a 

surface of the shadow mask on an electron gun side and 
communicating with the larger opening. The smaller 

opening of each of the electron beam apertures located 
at a peripheral portion of the shadow mask is defined by 

a wall surface of the shadow mask. The wall surface 
includes an outward portion (40a) which is located outward 

in a radial direction with respect to a center of 
the shadow mask and a central-side portion (40b) which 

is located on a central side of the shadow mask. An 
angle (ϑ1) defined by the outward portion and a central 

axis (40c) of the smaller opening is larger than an 
angle (ϑ2) defined by the central-side portion and the 

central axis of the smaller opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color cathode
ray tube and, particularly, a color cathode ray tube
having a shadow mask, and a method of manufacturing the
same.Generally, a shadow mask type color cathode ray
tube has a glass envelope constituted by a substantially
rectangular faceplate, a skirt portion continuous to the
faceplate, a cylindrical neck opposing the faceplate,
and a funnel connecting the skirt portion and the neck.
A phosphor screen on which phosphors that emit light
in red, blue, and green are regularly arranged is formed
on the inner surface of the faceplate. An electron
gun for emitting a plurality of electron beams corresponding
to red, blue, and green is disposed in the
neck.A shadow mask having a large number of regularly
arranged electron beam apertures is disposed at a
position closely opposing the phosphor screen at a
predetermined distance. The peripheral portion of the
shadow mask is bonded to a mask frame and is engaged
with stud pins of the skirt portion through a mask
holder. Each electron beam aperture of the shadow mask
is formed such that the sectional area of an opening on
the phosphor screen side (to be referred to as a larger
opening hereinafter) is larger than that of an opening
on the electron gun side (to be referred to as a small 
opening hereinafter). With this shape, a constant
electron beam amount is maintained even when an electron
beam is obliquely incident on the electron beam aperture
at the peripheral portion of the shadow mask.In the color cathode ray tube having the above
arrangement, the shadow mask has a function of
transmitting the electron beam therethrough such that
the electron beam correctly lands on only the phosphor
of each color which is geometrically in a one to one
relationship with the electron beam aperture, and is a
significant element called a color selection electrode.
The electron beam apertures of the shadow mask may be
circular or rectangular in shape. Usually, shadow masks
having circular apertures are used in display tubes that
display characters and figures at high definition, and
shadow masks having rectangular apertures are mainly
used in tubes for household, such as television tubes.For example, a rectangular electron beam aperture
is formed such that its longer side extends to be
substantially perpendicular to the shorter side
(vertical axis) of a substantially rectangular
faceplate. A large number of vertical aperture columns
each having a plurality of vertically arranged apertures
are arranged in the horizontal direction. The
