Process for launching to a target (3) and controlling 
from an aircraft (1) a projectile (2) which is not guided 

vertically, having a mixed, free (94) then retarded (96) 
trajectory (6; 93), wherein in an approach phase before 

launch and for each of various successive approach 
positions (5, 51) of the aircraft (1) 


1- the position of the target (3) is determined in a 
three-dimensional reference linked to the aircraft (1), 
2- taking account of the velocity of the aircraft (1) and 
within the said reference, the anticipated virtual 

trajectory (6) of the projectile (2), launched at the 
position (5, 51) concerned, is calculated 
3- the distance from the target (3) on the said virtual 
trajectory (6) is calculated and
 
the projectile (2) is launched (T1, T2) just after the said 

distance has passed a minimum, 
 
characterised in that in the approach phase and for each of 

the various positions (5, 51) of the aircraft (1), an angle 
of impact (A) of the trajectory (6) of the projectile (2) 

to the horizontal plane containing the target (3) is 
calculated, it is compared with a predetermined value (A0) 

and, for the validation of the distance calculation, only 
the trajectories (6) having an angle of impact (A) 

attaining the said value (A0) are taken into account. 
Process according to claim 1, wherein as the duration 
of the travel (TB) of the projectile (2) on the free 

trajectory portion (94) is adjustable, this travel duration  
 

(TB) is automatically controlled by the minimum of the said 
distance from the target (3) so that, for each of the 

various positions (5, 51), the distance from the target (3) 
on the trajectory (93) is equal to this minimum and, before 

expiry of the said duration of travel (TB), a signal of 
duration of travel on the free trajectory portion (94) is 

transmitted to the projectile (2). 
Process according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein 
when the actual trajectory (5) of the aircraft (1) is too 

low for the projectile (2) to be able to reach the target 
(3) at the predetermined angle of impact (A0), the 

trajectory (5) of the aircraft (1) is artificially raised 
(8) parallel to itself while the aircraft (1) flies level, 

the determination of the position of the target (3) and the 
calculation of the anticipated virtual trajectories (6; 9) 

of the projectile (2) are effected for approach 
positions of the artificial trajectory of the aircraft (1), 

then, after a position for the projectile (2) has been 
determined which can be reached by resource from the actual 

position of the aircraft (1) and for which it would be 
within range of the target (3), a resource of the aircraft 

(1) raises its actual trajectory (5) and the final 
artificial trajectory (81) is calculated so that it becomes 

tangential to its actual trajectory (51) at a point (52) 
beyond which the projectile (2) can be launched. 
Process according to claim 3, wherein in order to 
determine the artificial trajectory (81) of the aircraft 

(1) during the resource (51), for various positions (Tk) of 
the actual trajectory of the resource (51), corresponding 

positions (Mk) on the artificial trajectory (81) are 
determined by the following steps: 


for each approach position (Tk) the actual trajectory  
 

(51) of the aircraft (1)- is assimilated to a circle (Ck), 
locally tangential to the actual trajectory (51) of the 

aircraft (1) and of the same curvature as that trajectory 
in this position (Tk), 
a reference position (Pk) is determined by plotting, on 
the perpendicular of the centre (0k) of the said circle 

(Ck), the altitude of the position (Mk-1) of the final 
artificial trajectory (81) of the aircraft (1) determined 

for the preceding position (Tk-1), 
an angle of reference (Bk) to the horizontal, depending 
on the acceleration undergone by the aircraft (1) on its 

actual trajectory (51) at the position (Tk) concerned, is 
calculated, 
a construction circle (C0k) is determined which is 
tangential to the assimilated circle (Ck) which passes via 

the said reference position (Pk) presenting the reference 
angle (Bk) and 
the desired position (Mk) on the artificial trajectory 
(81) is determined by raising a perpendicular passing via 

the position (Tk) concerned on the actual trajectory (51) 
up to its intersection with the construction circle (C0k). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, 
during the comparison of the angle of impact (A) and the 

predetermined value (A0), a divergence of the angle of 
impact is determined, the length of the retarded trajectory 

(96) is consequently modified in order to reduce the 
divergence of the angle of impact by determining a desired 

corrected duration of travel (TCHFM) on a new retarded 
trajectory (96) having an angle of impact with the 

predetermined value (A0) and from this a corresponding  
 

corrected duration (TB) of travel on a new free trajectory 
(94) is deduced. 
Process according to claim 5, wherein 

in dependence upon the said desired corrected duration of 
travel (TCHFM) on the retarded trajectory (96) and a 

filtered average velocity (VMOY) of the projectile (2) 
during the retarded trajectory (96), a height (ARRET) of 

retarded fall for the new trajectory (93) is calculated 
cyclically, 
by comparison of the height (ARRET) of the retarded fall 
with the heights of successive points on the new free 

trajectory (94), a length and the said corrected duration 
(TB) of travel on the new free trajectory (94) are 

determined, 
from the new trajectory (93), a resulting height (SAVARR) 
and duration (TEMPCF) of retarded fall are determined for 

the new retarded trajectory (96), and therefrom an average 
velocity value (SAVARR/TEMPCF) of travel on the new 

retarded trajectory (96) is calculated and 
in order to obtain a new filtered average velocity (VMOY) 
intended for a subsequent cycle, the said average velocity 

value (SAVARR/TEMPCF) of travel on the new retarded 
trajectory (96) and a filtered average velocity value 

(VMOYP) calculated during the preceding cycle are combined. 
Process of guiding, after launch according to the 
process of one of claims 1 to 6, a projectile to a target 

(3), wherein as the projectile (2) comprises a data 
receiver arranged to cooperate, after launch, with a 

transmitter on the aircraft (1), a virtual trajectory (93)  
 

of the projectile (2) coinciding with its actual trajectory 
is calculated after launch and the corresponding signals 

for.duration of travel on the free trajectory (94) are 
transmitted to the projectile (2). 
Process for launching to a target (3) and controlling 
from an aircraft (1) a projectile (2) which is not guided 

vertically having a mixed, free (94) then retarded (96) 
trajectory (6; 93), wherein in an approach phase before 

launch and for each of various successive approach 
positions (5, 51) of the aircraft (1) 


1- the position of the target (3) is determined in a 
three-dimensional reference linked to the aircraft (1), 
2- taking account of the velocity of the aircraft (1) and 
within the said reference, the anticipated virtual 

trajectory (6) of the projectile (2), launched at the 
position (5, 51) concerned, is calculated 
3- the distance from the target (3) on the said virtual 
trajectory (6) is calculated and
 
the projectile (2) is launched (T1, T2) just after the said 

distance has passed a minimum, 
 
characterised in that when the actual trajectory of the 

aircraft (1) is too low to calculate with specific 
precision the anticipated virtual trajectory of the 

projectile (2) and to calculate therefrom the said 
distance, the trajectory (5) of the aircraft (1) is 

artificially raised (8) parallel to itself while the 
aircraft (1) flies level, the determination of the position 

of the target (3) and the calculation of the anticipated 
virtual trajectories (6; 9) of the projectile (2) are  

 
effected for the approach positions on the artificial 

trajectory of the aircraft (1), then, after a position for 
the projectile (2) has been determined which can be reached 

by resource from the actual position of the aircraft (1) 
and for which it would be within range of the target (3), a 

resource of the aircraft (1) raises its actual trajectory 
(5) and the final artificial trajectory (81) is calculated 

so that it becomes tangential to its actual trajectory (51) 
at a point (52) beyond which the projectile (2) can be 

launched. 
Process according to claim 8, wherein in order to 
determine the artificial trajectory (81) of the aircraft 

(1) during the resource (51), for various positions (Tk) of 
the actual trajectory of the resource (51), corresponding 

positions (Mk) on the artificial trajectory (81) are 
determined by the following steps: 


for each approach position (Tk) the actual trajectory 
(51) of the aircraft (1) is assimilated to a circle (Ck), 

locally tangential to the actual trajectory (51) of the 
aircraft (1) and of the same curvature as that trajectory 

in this position (Tk), 
a reference position (Pk) is determined by plotting, on 
the perpendicular of the centre (0k) of the said circle 

(Ck), the altitude of the position (Mk-1) of the final 
artificial trajectory (81) of the aircraft (1) determined 

for the preceding position (Tk-1), 
an angle of reference (Bk) to the horizontal, depending 

of the acceleration undergone by the aircraft (1) on its 
actual trajectory (51) at the position (Tk) concerned, is 

calculated,  
 
a construction circle (C0k) is determined which is 
tangential to the assimilated circle (Ck) which passes via 

the said reference position (Pk) presenting the reference 
angle (Bk) and 
the desired position (Mk) on the artificial trajectory 
(81) is determined by raising a perpendicular passing via 

the position (Tk) concerned on the actual trajectory (51) 
up to its intersection with the construction circle (C0k).
