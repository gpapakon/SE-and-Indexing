<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wallpaper remover. 
In particular, the present invention relates to a 
wallpaper remover comprising at least one surfactant, 
at least one humectant and a major portion water. There are generally three different types of 
wallpaper. The first and simplest type of wallpaper 
consists solely of a paper backing. The second type of 
wallpaper comprises a paper backing and a vinylic or 
acrylic layer coated over the paper backing thereby 
rendering the paper backing waterproof. A third type 
of wallpaper is a composite design wherein a vinyl film 
is laminated onto a paper or fabric backing. Wallpaper is adhered to a substrate by 
applying a layer of adhesive and/or paste to either the 
substrate or the wallpaper and then applying the 
wallpaper to the substrate. Commonly, pastes such as a 
mixture of wheat paste and molasses or adhesives based 
on acrylics, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, 
starch or mixtures thereof are utilized to secure the 
wallpaper to the substrate. Although these adhesives amply secure the 
wallpaper to the substrate, often it is desirable to 
remove the wallpaper from the substrate. For example, 
one may want to repaint the substrate or apply a new 
wallpaper to the substrate. Because of the wallpaper's 
tendency to strongly adhere to a substrate, the removal 
of wallpaper can cause much consternation. The 
adhesive can transfer to the substrate thus making it 
necessary to remove the adhesive after the backing has 
been removed or the adhesion of the adhesive can 
increase with age thereby increasing the physical labor 
necessary to remove the wallpaper.  A number of attempts have been made to 
overcome these problems. One attempt has been to 
physically remove the wallpaper by applying water or a 
softening liquid which incorporates water to the 
wallpaper and then peeling and/or scraping the 
wallpaper from the substrate. It is theorized that the 
water acts as an agent to soften the adhesive and/or 
paste. Once the water or softening liquid has 
penetrated the wallpaper, the removal of the wallpaper 
is relatively easy. However, getting the water or 
softening liquid to the adhesive is not an easy task 
because the water has a tendency to run off the 
wallpaper. In an attempt to maintain better contact of 
the water and/or the softening liquid with the 
wallpaper, gels have been utilized to resist 
displacement of the softening liquid. Although such 
gels have been used with some success, the removal of 
the wallpaper, nonetheless, has proven
