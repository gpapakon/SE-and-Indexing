<ABSTRACT>
A hand box sealing tape applicator (10) for dispensing 
and applying a length of tape from a roll of tape to an 

object includes a frame comprising a support portion (20) 
and an angled nose portion (18). A tape roll support means 

is provided on the support portion of the frame for 
rotatably supporting a roll of tape thereon and for 

providing a gripping surface for a user to hold and 
manipulate the hand tape applicator. Furthermore, an 

applicator member, preferably comprising an application 
roller, is operatively supported by the angled nose 

portion of the frame so that a space will be defined 
between the applicator member and a roll of tape when 

it is supported on the roll support means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a hand 
held tape dispenser. More specifically, the present 
invention is a hand held box sealing tape dispenser 
which is designed to accommodate the direct hand 
application of such box sealing tape to a box or carton 
with greater ease and control. Tape dispensing apparatuses are typically designed 
to accommodate the specific type of tape to be 
dispensed, the object to which the tape is to be 
adhered to, the frequency of application, and other 
general use and environmental considerations relating 
to the specific manner and location of the application 
for the specific use. Such tape dispensing apparatuses 
include those which are automatic and apply adhesive 
tape to objects or a moving web in a production line, 
manual dispensers for tape application either in a 
production line setting or on as needed basis, and 
combinations thereof. Within manual tape dispensers, 
hand dispensers have been developed for a variety of 
tapes for dispensing and/or applying such tapes as 
needed. Hand held dispensers typically include a support 
or hub for rotatably supporting a roll of adhesive tape 
on the dispenser, some tape guide means for guiding the 
tape from the roll to a dispensing point on the 
dispenser, and a blade or the like for cutting the 
dispensed tape at a desired length. Moreover, hand 
held tape applicators have been developed which not 
only dispense tape in the same sense as the dispensers 
just previously described but also include an 
application member which rides against the tape backing  
 
to apply the tape on the surface of the object being 
taped. A disadvantage of hand dispensers that do not have 
an applicator means is that they often require the use 
of two hands for tape application. Typically, the user 
of such a hand dispenser would grasp the dispenser and 
would use their other hand to apply and press the tape 
onto the object. In the case of a box or carton 
sealing technique, to which the present invention is 
specifically directed, the user would pull out a 
desired length of tape from the dispenser and apply it 
to a front surface of the box. Then, the user would 
pull the dispenser across the box top, over the center 
seam, while applying hand pressure with the opposite 
hand to press or buff the tape down. Lastly, the user 
would continue the tape down the backside of the box a 
desired length, would cut the tape, and would buff that 
portion down by hand. An example of a box sealing tape hand dispenser is 
that available

<CLAIMS>
A hand tape applicator for dispensing and applying 
a length of tape from a roll of tape to an object, 

said hand tape applicator comprising: 

a frame comprising a support portion and a nose 
portion extending from said support portion at 

an angle, 
roll support means provided on said support portion 
of said frame for rotatably supporting a 

roll of tape thereon, said roll support means 
including a gripping surface for a user to hold 

and manipulate said hand tape applicator, 
an applicator member operatively supported by 
said angled nose portion of said frame so that a 

space will be defined between the applicator 
member and a roll of tape when supported on sa
id 
roll support means, said space being positioned 

and of sufficient size so that when a roll of 
tape is supported on said roll support means and 

the roll of tape is held above one surface of an 
object, the application member can be positioned 

against another surface of the object that is 
perpendicular to the first surface with a corner 

of the object within said space, 
guide means for defining a tape guide path from 
said roll support means to said applicator member, 

and 
cutting means positioned adjacent to said 
applicator member for cutting the length of tape 

from the roll after it has been dispensed and 
applied to an object. 
The applicator according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said application member comprises an 

 
application roller that is rotatably supported on 

said nose portion of said frame. 
The applicator according to claim 1 or 2 characterized 
by a brake element rotatably supported on 

said frame including a brake surface for engaging 
the roll of tape when provided on the roll support 

means for permitting a user to control the tape 
tension during application. 
The applicator according to claim 2 or 3 characterized 
in that said guide means defines a tape 

guide path along said frame without crossing said 
space between said applicator roller and a tape 

roll. 
The applicator according to any one of claims 1 to 
4 characterized in that said guide means comprises 

a guide roller rotatably mounted to said frame. 
The applicator according to claim 5 characterized 
in that said guide roller is rotatably mounted to 

said frame at about a transition point between said 
support portion of said frame and said angled nose 

portion. 
The applicator according to any one of claims 2 to 
6 characterized by a tape holder connected to said 

frame and extending toward the periphery of said 
application roller for positioning tape from the 

roll of tape against the application roller. 
The applicator according to claim 7 characterized 
in that said tape holder extends along said frame 

at an angle of approximately 45 degrees from a line 
 

through the axis of said guide roller and the axis 
of the tape roll when supported thereon. 
The applicator according to claim 7 or 8 characterized 
in that said tape holder is connected to 

said frame by way of a support positioned adjacent 
to and extending substantially parallel to said 

guide roller of said guide means. 
The applicator according to any one of claims 5 to 
9 characterized by a cap element connected to the 

distal end of said support and rotatably supporting 
the distal end of said guide roller.
