<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an injection port assembly for subcutaneous delivery 
of medication. A single moulded body (11) has a soft flexible cannula 

(14) extending downwardly from a generally flat bottom surface and a 
self-sealing septum (22) mounted at the centre of a top surface which 

is generally of a concave shape sloping downward towards its outer 
perimeter at which point the single body is very thin. The single body 

(11) also has a tubular extension (12) which is directed outward 
parallel to the skin's surface. A metal needle (8) which penetrates 

through the septum and through the lumen of the soft cannula is used 
for inserting the cannula through the skin. The distal section of the 

needle has an external shoulder which engages an internal shoulder in 
the cannula so that the cannula will be in tension during insertion 

thereby preventing an accordion-like compressional failure of the 
cannula. A quick-release connector on the proximal end of the tubular 

extension or mounted directly on the injection port assembly allows the 
tubing connecting the injection port assembly to a portable medication 

pump to be disconnected when the patient showers or performs some 
similar activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for the subcutaneous delivery
of medication, more especially subcutaneous injection ports which are
inserted through the skin, and which may remain in place for several
days for the periodic or continuous administration of medication.Currently a major application of such injection ports is to
provide chronic delivery of medication such as insulin from portable
pumps. When used with a pump, a fluid line is required to connect the
injection port to the portable pump. Another application of a
subcutaneous injection port is to permit multiple injections without
the need to repuncture the skin. In this application, medication is
injected from a standard hypodermic syringe and needle through a soft
elastomer septum into the injection port which delivers the medication
subcutaneously.If a hollow metal needle is left in place through the skin to
provide medication delivery, after one or two days the needle becomes
uncomfortable to the patient. A more comfortable disposable
injection port is described in U.S Patent No. 3,547,119 by Hall et al
which has a soft, thin-walled cannula which is subcutaneously inserted
over a metal needle. After insertion, the metal needle is removed
leaving only the soft cannula through the skin. However the Hall
device has several limitations, namely: 
(1) it is designed for infusion into the bladder and not for subcutaneous
injection;(2) the soft, thin-walled cannula which is subcutaneously inserted over the
metal needle is placed in compression during insertion which can result in
buckling of the cannula;(3) the device has an extremely high profile making it impractical for
ambulatory use where it is highly desirable to be hidden under clothing; and(4) it does not provide a bacterial filter.More recently, a soft cannula subcutaneous injection set described in U.S. Patent No.
4,755,173 by Kanopka et al has become available. While being lower in profile than the
Hall device and specifically designed for subcutaneous delivery of medication, the Kanopka
device also has several shortcomings, namely:
(1) there is no method for disconnecting the tubing near the point of
subcutaneous insertion thus requiring a long length of tubing to remain
connected while showering, exercising or performing other activities for
which having a long length of tubing is disadvantageous;(2) many separate parts are required to construct the injection set which
increases costs and the probability of leakage;(3) like the Hall device, the soft, thin-walled cannula which is

lumen (227) that protrudes in a generally downward direction from the injection port
assembly (200), the lumen (227) having proximal and distal ends, characterised in

that the lumen's proximal end is situated adjacent to and below a septum (205)
arranged in the main body (210), the cannula section (220) further including two

holes (226), the holes including respective engaging means (225) for attachment to a
fluid connector engaging means.
A device according to Claim 1, wherein the septum (205) is formed integral
with the main body (210).
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the septum (205) is formed at the
centre of the main body (210).
A device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein a stylet needle (251) is
