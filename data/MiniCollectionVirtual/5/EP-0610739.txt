<ABSTRACT>
A printed matter is printed by a ink containing a color 
coupler that is chromatized from substantially invisible colorless 

state to colored state by means of a color coupling additive 
applied by an applicator. The color coupler is at least one 

electron donative coloring compound selected from a group A 
composed of crystal violet lactone; malachite green lactone; 1.3-dimethyl-6-diethylaminofluoran; 

6-diethylamino-benzo[α]-fluoran; 

3-cyclohexyl methylamino-6-methyl-7-anilinofluoran; benzoyl 
leucomethylene blue; ethyl leucomethylene blue; methoxybenzoyl 

leucomethylene blue; 2-(phenylimino ethanedilidene )-3.3-trimethyl-indoline; 
1.3.3-trimethyl-indolino-7'chloro-β-naphthospiropyran; 

di-β-naphthospiropyran; N-acetylauramine; 
N-phenylauramine; and rhodamine B lactam. The color coupling 

additive is at least one electron acceptive developing compound 
selected from a group B composed of zinc salicylate, bisphenol A 

and inorganic and organic acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printed matter provided 
with a color developing area that is changed from a colorless 
to colored state by application of a color coupling additive, and 
capable of serving for attractive education and entertainment. It is widely known that such pH-indicator as phenolphthalein, 
for example, is changed from a substantially invisible 
colorless state to visible colored state by an effect of alkali 
and acid. And a printed matter with such color developing area as 
hidden letters and graphics printed by using such pH-indicator as 
a color coupler is suggested. Such printed matter is capable of 
providing for such effect of hiding the color developing area and 
users' high interest and entertainment, impressively presenting a 
content of the printed matter by an apparent change, unexpectedness 
and the like in the color development of color coupling area 
from a colorless to colored state, and its applications to such 
fields as picture books, coloring books, reference books and 
exercise books are demanded. However, although such pH-indicators are present in 
various colors, because the color coupling pH ranges and achromatic 
pH ranges are respectively different and specific to them, 
it is very difficult to simultaneously chromatize and achromatize 
multiple pH-indicators with a single color coupling additive. In 
a printed matter using such pH-indicators, therefore, colors to  
 
be developed have been few in number, causing a monotonous appearance, 
and it was difficult to repeatedly effect the chromatic/achromatic 
operations in plural colors. EP-A-0 403 903 discloses a print having 
a color-forming area and a discoloring area. The color-forming area is printed by 
an ink containing a first color-changing agent which changes from substantially invisible colorlessness to 
visibleness by applying a color former. The discoloring area is printed by an ink containing a second color-changing 
agent which changes a from substantially invisible colorlessness to visibleness by applying the color 
former and returns to invisible colorlessness state as the time passes naturally after changing its color. EP-A-0 460 270 discloses a color changing print, wherein 
plural areas are printed by using plural types of color changing 
inks which develop into different colors from the substantially invisible colorless state by reaction with a color 
changing agent. By the emergence of print from colorlessness and by giving changes in the appearing colors, 
unexpectedness and
