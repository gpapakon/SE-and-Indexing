<ABSTRACT>
A steel wire (10) adapted for the reinforcement of the bead 
area of rubber tyres has a diameter d ranging from 0.75 mm to 

2.50 mm, a tensile strength lying above 3100 - 600xd MPa, d 
being expressed in mm, a rubber adherable coating in the form 

of a copper alloy with a weight ranging from 0.10 to 1.40 grams 
per kilogram steel wire, and has a surface which is substantially 

free of residual macro tensile stresses in order to 
improve the torsional behaviour. The residual macro tensile 

stresses may be removed by subjecting the steel wire (10) to a 
series of subsequent bendings over rollers (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steel wire adapted for the 
reinforcement of the bead area of rubber tyres.
 
Such a steel wire has a diameter ranging from 0.75 mm to 2.50 
mm. Current steel wire diameters are 0.800 mm, 0.890 mm, 0.950 
mm, 0.965 mm, 1.000 mm, 1.295 mm, 1.420 mm, 1.550 mm, 1.600 mm, 
1.650 mm, 1.820 mm, 2.000 mm and 2.200 mm. The present invention mainly relates to steel wires having a 
round cross-section and which are especially adapted to reinforce 
cable-bead structures for passenger and truck tyres, 
single-wire bead structures and tape-wound bead structures for 
passenger tyres and hexagonal or shaped bead structures for 
truck tyres. In a continuing trend towards realizing tyres having ever lower 
weights, efforts have been made to decrease the weight of the 
bead structure also. Reduction of the weight of the bead structure 
necessarily means a reduction in the cross-sectional area 
of the bead structure. If the overall breaking load of the bead 
structure must remain unchanged or must exceed a predetermined 
minimum limit, steel wires with higher individual tensile 
strengths must be chosen. Besides selecting a proper rod composition, 
these high tensile strengths can only be obtained by 
subjecting the steel wires to a high deformation, e.g. by way 
of cold drawing. If no measures are taken, the high tensile 
strengths are obtained at the expense of other features such as 
a good torsional behaviour.
 
The problem with high-tensile steel wires adapted for the reinforcement 
of the bead area of tyres is particularly important 
for the following reasons : 
(i) after the final drawing step, the steel wires are in most 
cases subjected to a stress-relieving treatment in order 
to give the steel wire the necessary elongation and to  
 
give the steel wire a proper surface before coating ; this 
stress-relieving treatment lowers the tensile strength of 
the steel wire with five to ten per cent, and even with 
fifteen per cent; the higher the tensile strength and the 
more extensive the final deformation, the higher the 
decrease in tensile strength ; in order to compensate for 
this reduction in tensile strength, the applied deformation 
of the steel wires needs to be higher than the level 
corresponding to the predetermined tensile strength, this 
means an increased risk for a still lower level of other 
features such as the torsional behaviour ; (ii) after the stress-relieving treatment, the steel wires are 
provided with a thin coating of a rubber adherable material 
such as a
