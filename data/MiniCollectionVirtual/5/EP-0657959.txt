<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) is disclosed for maintaining an 
electrical connector assembly (12) mounted on a printed 

circuit board (14) during soldering of the assembly to the 
board. A housing (16) has a plurality of terminals (18) 

mounted therein. The terminals include solder tails (20) 
projecting from the housing for insertion into respective 

holes (22) in the printed circuit board. Each terminal 
(18) is stamped in planar form of sheet metal material. 

The solder tails (20) are arranged in a row of pairs 
thereof, with the solder tails in each row being in a plane 

transverse to the row. All of the solder tails are of 
similar shape with each solder tail including a straight 

intermediate section (34) projecting from the housing, a 
straight tip section (36) for insertion into a respective 

hole in the printed circuit board, and an offset curved 
section (38) between the intermediate and tip sections. 

The curved section of one solder tail extends in a 
direction transverse to the row opposite to the curved 

section of the other solder tail in each pair thereof. 
Each curved section (38) is shaped such that each solder 

tail engages the circuit board only at the curved section 
within its respective hole. The straight intermediate 

section (34) and the straight tip section (36) of each 
solder tail are collinear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector assembly of the type adapted for mounting on a
printed circuit board.Multi-circuit electrical connectors of the type
adapted for mounting on a printed circuit board typically
include a plurality of electrical contact members or
terminals disposed within a unitary dielectric housing,
normally a molded plastic housing in which the terminals
are inserted following molding. In these assemblies, the
housing typically surrounds portions of the terminals
adjacent the printed circuit board to provide rigid support
for the terminals. In some instances, one or more mounting
posts are molded integrally with the housing and are
positionable in holes in the printed circuit board.The terminals of such connector assemblies often
have solder tails insertable through holes in the printed
circuit board for soldering to circuit traces on the board
and/or in the holes. The solder tails sometimes are used
to lock the connector assembly to the circuit board prior
to soldering or at least to maintain the connector assembly
mounted on the board during soldering of the assembly to
the board. This locking often is accomplished by enlarged
head portions or laterally projecting hooks which snap
under the bottom side of the printed circuit board and
thereby hold the connector assembly to the board. The 
terminals may be thin stamped contact members, with a
stamped locking hook projecting outwardly from one side of
the solder tail portion for locking under the bottom side
of the board.One of the problems in using "hooked" solder
tails of the terminals for locking the connector assembly
to the circuit board is in accommodating variances in the
size or location of the holes in the board through which
the solder tails are inserted and variances in the
dimensions of the solder tail. U.S. Patent No. 5,076,804
to Bertho et al, dated December 31, 1991 and assigned to
the assignee of this invention, is directed specifically to
those problems in "hooked" solder tails by providing an
electrical connector assembly with terminals which have
hooked solder tails considerably less sensitive to
variations in the holes in the printed circuit board.Another approach involving the use of the solder
tails for maintaining an electrical connector assembly
mounted on a printed circuit board during soldering of the
assembly to the board is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,847,588
to Doutrich, dated July 11, 1989. Rather than employing
