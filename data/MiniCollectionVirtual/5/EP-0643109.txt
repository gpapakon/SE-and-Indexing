<ABSTRACT>
A process for the direct preparation of pigmentary 2,9-dichloroquinacridone, which 
comprises oxidizing 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone directly to pigmentary 2,9-dichloroquinacridone 

by heating a reaction mixture comprising 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone, 
an alkali metal hydroxide, a water-soluble organic solvent, water and effective 

amounts of an oxidizing agent and a phthalimidomethylquinacridone particle growth 
inhibitor. The process yields pigmentary 2,9-dichloroquinacridone directly; without the 

need for additional particle-size reducing aftertreatments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The quinacridone family of compounds and their pigmentary properties are well known.
The pigmentary quinacridones include the parent compound, quinacridone, and various
disubstituted quinacridones, including 2,9-dichloroquinacridone.It is well known in the pigments art that substituted quinacridone pigments can be prepared
by the oxidation of the corresponding dihydroquinacridones. The product of such an
oxidation, known as a crude quinacridone, is generally unsuitable for use as a pigment and
must be further processed to develop the requisite pigmentary properties, such as particle
size, particle shape, polymorphic phase and tinctorial strength.The crude quinacridone is commonly converted to a pigmentary form by milling the crude
quinacridone with large quantities of inorganic salt followed by extraction of the resulting
mill powder, or by dissolving the pigment in large quantities of concentrated sulfuric acid
and drowning the solution into water (acid pasting). Since these multistep procedures
generally require a diversity of operations conducted at elevated temperatures in acidic
environments, simpler, more economical procedures for preparing pigmentary quinacridones
are highly desirable.It is known from US 4,197,404 that o-carboxybenzamidomethylquinacridone, which is a
hydrolysis product of 2-phthalimidomethylquinacridone, can be utilized as a particle
growth inhibitor to prepare higher strength γ-quinacridone directly from the oxidation of
β-dihydroquinacridone. However, the reference discloses that when more than 1.0% of
o-carboxybenzamidomethylquinacridone was used, the oxidation of the β-dihydroquinacridone
was inhibited. This results in incomplete conversion of β-dihydroquinacridone
to γ-quinacridone.The primary object of this invention is to prepare pigmentary 2,9-dichloroquinacridone
directly during synthesis, without the need for aftertreatments. This objective is achieved
by the discovery that the inhibition of the oxidation of dihydroquinacridone, which results 
from adding more than 1 percent of the particle growth inhibitor, does not occur during the
oxidation of 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydroquinacridone. Therefore, additional amounts of
particle growth inhibitor can be added to the reaction mixture in order to obtain pigmentary
2,9-dichloroquinacridone directly from the synthesis. Thus 2,9-dichloroquinacridone
of pigmentary quality and desirable crystallinity and crystal phase can be prepared
directly, without the need for further particle size reducing aftertreatments, by oxidizing
