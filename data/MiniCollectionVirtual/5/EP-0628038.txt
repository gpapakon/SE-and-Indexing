<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is for the use of certain
3-alkyloxy-, aryloxy-, or arylalkyloxybenzo[b]-thiophene-2-carboxamides,
and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof, to prevent the adhesion of
leukocytes to endothelial cells. Leukocyte adherence
to vascular endothelium is integral to the
pathogenesis of inflammation. The adhesion process
precedes transendothelial migration of leukocytes into
surrounding tissue and ensuing tissue damage.
Compounds that can block this initial adhesive
interaction are expected to have efficacy in the
treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, and psoriasis. Other indications
would include but are not limited to adult respiratory
distress syndrome, reperfusion injury, ischemia,
ulcerative colitis, vasculitides, atherosclerosis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and tumor metastases.Adhesion receptors are organized into three main
families: the selectins, the immunoglobulin
superfamily, and the integrins (Nature 1990;346:426).
Members of all three classes are involved in mediating
leukocyte adhesion during inflammation (for reviews of
this area see: Thrombosis and Hemostasis
1991;65(3):223), Clinical and Experimental Allergy
1990;20:619, Transplantation 1989;48:727, Biochemical
Pharm 1990;40(8):1683). Endothelial leukocyte
adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1 or E-selectin) is a member
of the selectin family of glycoproteins that promote
cell-cell adhesion. ELAM-1 is reported to be 
maximally expressed on the surface of endothelial
cells 4 hours after stimulation of the endothelial
cells with cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) or
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or other inflammatory
mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Pro. Nat.
Acad. Sci. l987;84:9238).Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a
member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is also
upregulated with maximum expression occurring 12 to
24 hours after stimulus. It has been shown that
4 hours after the endothelial cells are stimulated
with an inflammatory mediator, both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1
are present on the cell surface (J. Clin. Invest.
1988;82:1746 and J. Immun. 1986;137:1893, Blood
1991;78:2721).The 3-alkyloxy-, aryloxy-, and arylalkyloxybenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamides
of the present
invention have been shown in an in vitro assay to
prevent the adhesion of neutrophils to human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) stimulated with TNFα.The 3-alkyloxy-, aryloxy-, and arylalkyloxybenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamides
of the present invention
are new but are included in the generic
