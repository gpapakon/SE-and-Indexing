<ABSTRACT>
In an optical communication system, a plurality of 
apparatuses are connected by a star coupler. A signal 

from each of the optical communication apparatuses is 
received by a receiving device such as a photodiode 

while a signal to each of the apparatuses is 
transmitted by a transmitting device such as a laser 

diode. A reference clock is supplied to the 
transmitting device. A clock of the signal from an 

optical communication apparatus is extracted to 
generate a phase comparison information signal of the 

extracted clock and the reference clock so as to supply 
the phase comparison information signal to the 

transmitting device. In the optical communication 
apparatus, a clock from the signal from the 

transmitting device is extracted, the phase comparison 
information signal contained in the signal from the 

transmitting device is extracted, and a transmit clock 
of the signal to be transmitted from the optical 

communication apparatus is controlled and oscillated 
such that a phase difference represented by the phase 

comparison signal is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
communication system and method in which a plurality of 
optical communication apparatuses are connected to each 
other in a star-like shape. Optical fiber communication has been used in 
various fields such as a computer network and an audio 
interface in recent years. To perform communication between remote 
communication apparatuses, it is insufficient to only 
transmit/receive data to be transmitted, and it is 
necessary to simultaneously transmit clock information 
or share the same clock information. For example, a 
conventional computer network such as FDDI uses a self 
synchronizing method in which data containing clock 
information therein is transmitted in one transmission 
system. In the self synchronizing method, as shown in 
Fig. 1, a clock extraction circuit 1802 extracts a 
clock from a signal photoelectrically converted by an 
O/E converter 1801. The clock need to be reproduced by 
a PPL (Phase-Locked Loop) circuit 1803 on a receive 
side.  In the above prior art, however, follow-up 
properties must be intentionally degraded to remove a 
jitter from the receive clock by the PPL circuit and 
stabilize the clock. This leads to an increase in 
overhead for channel connection, resulting in a low 
transmission speed. For this reason, this method 
cannot be applied to a channel requiring frequent 
connection switching. A digital PPL is used as a PLL 
technique for allowing high-speed locking. In this 
method, a counter is used as a VCO (Voltage-Controlled 
Oscillator), and a frequency much higher (preferably 
about 32 times) than a reproduction clock is necessary 
for original clocks. For this reason, this method 
cannot be applied to optical transmission using a clock 
frequency of about 100 MHz. The present invention has been made to solve the 
above problems, and has as its object to provide a 
communication system in which clock control is always 
performed. In order to achieve the above object, according to 
the present invention, there is provided the following 
optical communication system and method. Numbers in 
parentheses represent corresponding reference numerals 
in the accompanying drawings.  There is provided an optical communication system 
constituted by a plurality of optical communication 
apparatuses connected by a star coupler, comprising:
 
   a plurality of optical communication apparatuses 
101, 102, 103, 104;
 
   a star coupler 123 connected to the plurality of 
optical communication apparatuses 101, 102, 103, 104;
