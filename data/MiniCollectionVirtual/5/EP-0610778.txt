<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses a compact and inexpensive 
liquid separating apparatus which allows components of blood 

stored in a primary bag to be extracted in one direction 
without varying the position of an intermediate layer, 

enjoys high controllability, permits easy handling of tubes, 
and excels in accuracy of separation. It attains the 

liquids in an upper layer and a lower layer in the primary 
bag to flow in relevant satellite bags by detecting the 

position of an intermediate layer in the primary bag by 
means of an interface detecting member, continuously 

measuring the weight of the primary bag by means of a weight 
measuring unit, and continuing the open-shut control of 

clamp members thereby enabling the intermediate layer to 
remain in the intermediate position in the primary bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid separating
apparatus for individually extracting a plurality of
different liquids from such a flexible container as the
blood bag which is separated into a layer of different
components.Recently, the componential transfusion which
consists in transfusing only necessary components of blood
to a patient has been prevailing in the place of the whole
blood transfusion and the exclusive extraction of plasma
from the blood for the preparation of plasma medicines has
been in popular. For the purpose of obtaining the blood for
use in the componential transfusion or the preparation of
plasma medicines, the flexible blood bag or the so-called
multiple-bag has been used so far. The blood bag container
comprises a blood collecting bag (so-called primary bag) for
storing the blood collected from the donor and one or more
separation bags (so-called satellite bags) communicating via
liquid extracting tubes (hereinafter referred to simply as
"tubes") with the primary bag. The centrifugally separated
components of blood in the primary bag are individually
extracted and admitted into the satellite bags.When the blood collecting bag is treated with a
centrifuge, the blood in the bag is separated into such
layers of different components as a plasma layer, a red
blood cell layer and an intermediate layer (a soft
membranous layer containing platelets, white blood cells,
etc., so-called buffy coat layer). For these components of
blood to be utilized afterward as separated, it is necessary
that these components should be collected independently of
each other from the blood collecting bag and stored
respectively in the separation bags so as to preclude the 
separated components from being commingled.The fractional collection of such components of
blood has been heretofore accomplished by abuttting the
blood bag to a liquid separating device and then compressing
the blood bag with pressure externally exerted on the
opposite surfaces thereof thereby allowing the separated
components to be transferred into the relevant separation
bags through the relevant component extracting tubes which
communicate with the blood bag.By means of the blood bag of the kind which, as
disclosed in JP-A-3-47,266 (EP 407,999 A), is provided in
the upper part thereof with blood collecting tubes or
component extracting tubes, however, the componential
extraction of blood is not easily attained. Particularly
when the intermediate layer is to be extracted into the
satellite bag, the blood bag has a problem of
controllabili

said parent container (B1); said control unit (C), before pressurization,
comparing the weight of said parent container (B1) measured by

weight measuring unit (G) to a first predetermined weight for allowing
pressurization when the weight of said parent container (B1) equals

the first predetermined weight, and during the depression of said
container by said container pressing member (18) comparing the

weight of said parent container (B1) continuously measured by weight
measuring unit (G) to a second predetermined weight to effect the 

open-shut control of said clamp members (40a,40b) based on the data
of the weight of said parent container (B1) and the position of said

intermediate layer (S3), and shutting the two clamp members (40a,
40b) to stop the flows of liquids when a predetermined time has

elapsed or the weight of said parent container (B1) equals the
