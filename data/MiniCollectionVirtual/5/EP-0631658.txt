Compressed gas weapon system comprising: 

a firing mechanism (10) having a bore (12) with an axis and 
a projectile exit end (12g), a projectile (24) and 
a compressed gas cartridge (20) introduced separately from 
the projectile (24) for providing a gas pressure propelling 

the projectile (24) axially of the bore (12) towards the 
projectile exit end (12g), 
said bore (12) further having in axial distance from the 
projectile exit end (12g) a breech (18) for the projectile 

(24) and the compressed gas cartridge (20), 
a cartridge-receiving chamber (44) provided in the breech 
region (18) of the bore (12) in axial alignment with the 

bore (12), which chamber receives said compressed gas 
cartridge (20) in a position behind the projectile (24) in a 

position of readiness to fire of the compressed gas weapon 
system, 
said projectile (24) having with respect to the direction of 
firing an anterior end (24b) and with respect to the 

direction of firing an posterior apron portion (24a) 
enlarged in diameter, 
with the diameter of the apron portion (24a) being matched 
to the the diameter of the bore (12d) such, that with 

placing the projectile (24) in the position of readiness to 
fire a reduction in diameter of the apron portion (24a) 

occurs, 
said projectile (24) further having a cavity (24c) at its 
posterior end with respect to the direction of firing and 

the compressed gas cartridge (20) having a tapering 
projection (20c) with respect to the direction of firing at 

its anterior end , 
the cavity (24c) and the projection (20c) being in mutual 
abutment by respective conical surfaces (24a1, 20c1) over at 

least a part of their axial lengths, 
the projection (20c) of the compressed gas cartridge (20) 
having a gas exit orifice (20f) opening into the cavity 

(24c) of the projectile(24) in the position of readiness to 
fire,  

 
the firing mechanism (10) providing a firing pin (22), which 
is capable of causing the compressed gas cartridge (20) to 

release compressed gas, 
 
characterized in 


that the compressed gas cartridge (20) is a cartridge usable 
for a single shot, containing a propelling unit generating 

the compressed gas upon triggering a shot, 
that the compressed gas cartridge (20) is formed at least 
partly of plastic to be expandable in such a way and the 

outside diameter of the compressed gas cartridge (20) is 
matched to the inside diameter of the cartridge receiving 

chamber (44) in such a way, that the compressed gas 
cartridge (20) can be smoothly introduced into the cartridge 

receiving chamber (44) and expands, under the action of the 
gas pressure building up in the expansion chamber upon 

triggering a firing, into gas-tight contact with an inner 
periphery (44a) of the cartridge receiving chamber (44), and 

that the compressed gas cartridge (20) provides in its 
interior an expansion chamber (20b) for building up and 

homogenizing the pressure. 
Weapon system according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the conical surfaces (24a1, 24a2, 20c1) of the cavity (24c) 

and the projection (20c) have a ccinciding angle of taper 
(α) over at least a portion of their axial lengths. 
Weapon system according to any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the cartridge (20) is positioned in 

axial direction of the bore (12d) by a stop (44b) 
weapon system according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the inside diameter (44a) of the 

cartridge-receiving chamber (44) slightly exceeds the 
maximum diameter (24a) of the projectile (24), so that 

the projectile (24) is smoothly insertable in the 
cartridge-receiving chamber (44), and in that the inside 

diameter (12c) of the bore (12d) has a smaller value than 
the inside diameter (44a) of
 the cartridge-receiving  
 

chamber (44), the projectile (24) being capable of being 
pushed into the bore (12d) by the cartridge (20) upon 

introduction of the cartridge (20) into the cartridge-receiving 
chamber (44). 
Weapon system according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the bore (12) is provided with 

grooves (12b) and lands (12a) and that the lands (12a) are 
engaged with the apron portion (24a) of the projectile (24) 

in the position of readiness to fire. 
Weapon system according to any of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that, between the cartridge-receiving 

chamber (44) and the bore (12b), a tapered transition (44c) 
is provided. 
Weapon system according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the bore (12d), adjacent to the 

cartridge-receiving chamber (44), has a smooth cylindrical 
segment (12c) towards the projectile exit end (12g) of the 

bore (12d), a segment (12e) provided with rifling grooves 
(12b), whereby an end region (24b) of the projectile (24) 

anterior in the direction of fire in a position of 
readiness to fire, is accommodated by the segment (12e)

grooves (12b) project slightly radially inward relative to 

the smooth cylindrical segment (12c) and pass over by way 
of conical transition surfaces (12f) into the smooth 

cylindrical segment (12c).  
 
Weapon system according to claim 8, characterized in that 
the outside diameter (24b) of the projectile segment 

(24b) anterior in firing direction is smaller than the
