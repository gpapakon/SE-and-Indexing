<ABSTRACT>
A black matrix substrate (12) for use for colour filters of 
a liquid crystal display 

(LCD) comprises a regular pattern of light absorbing regions (14). The 
light absorbing regions comprise a resin and metal particles 

of which not less than 80% of the total amount of particles 
have a particle diameter in the range 5 nm to 50 nm and the 

optical density of the light absorbing regions is not less 
than 1.5. The metal particles are formed by a process of 

electroless deposition. The LCD has the advantage of a 
high contrast and a low power supply requirement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a black matrix substrate, a 
colour filter using the substrate and a liquid crystal display 
device using the substrate. A liquid crystal display device of monochromatic or full 
colour type have been recently paid much attention as a flat 
display device. In order to control three primary colours in 
such a liquid crystal display device, there are an active 
matrix method and a simple matrix method, each of which 
utilizes a colour filter. The liquid crystal display device 
is constructed to perform colour display by using picture 
element of three primary colours (R, G, B) and controlling the 
transmission of each light of the three primary colours by 
electrical switching of the liquid crystal. This colour filter is constructed by forming each 
coloured layer, a protection layer and a transparent electrode 
layer on a transparent substrate. In order to improve a 
colour  
 
developing effect and a display contrast, there is formed a 
pattern (black matrix), which has a light-shielding property, 
at a boundary portion of each R, G, B picture element of the 
colored layer. In case of the liquid crystal display device of 
the active matrix method type, since a thin film transistor 
(TFT) is employed as a switching element, it becomes necessary 
to inhibit leaking of photo-current due to an external light. 
Thus, a very high light-shielding property is requested to the 
black matrix thereof. As black matrixes used in the above mentioned prior 
arts, there are a black matrix obtained by forming a relief 
through photo-etching of a chrome thin film formed by a vapor 
deposition or sputtering technique etc., a black matrix which 
is formed by dyeing a hydrophilic resin relief, a black matrix 
obtained by forming a relief using a photo-sensitive resin 
dispersed with black pigment, a black matrix obtained by 
electrodeposition of a black electrocoating paint, a black 
matrix which is formed by printing technique, and so on. However, in case of the above-mentioned black 
matrix, which is relief-formed by photo-etching the chrome 
thin film, although the accuracy in dimension is high because 
it uses the photo-process, the production cost is high because 
it requires the vacuum film forming process such as the vapor 
deposition or sputtering process and the production procedure 
is rather complicated. Further, in this case, in order to 
improve the display contrast under a strong external light  
 
circumstance, it becomes necessary to restrain the reflectance 
at the side of the
