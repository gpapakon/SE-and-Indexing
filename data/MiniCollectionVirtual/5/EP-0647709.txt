<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a process for preparing a 
substantially dry and stable composition containing a high 

concentration of heat-sensitive material, which process 
comprises: 


(a) contacting an aqueous concentrate of the heat-sensitive 
material with a food-grade water-absorbing material 

during sufficient time to allow transport of a large 
proportion of the water from the concentrate to the 

water-absorbing material, 
(b) separating the concentrate having a decreased water 
content from the water-absorbing material, and 
(c) collecting the separated concentrate. 
 
The heat-sensitive material in particular consists of microbial 

cells and the composition contains at least 10⁷ viable 
cells per gram of dry and stable composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
a substantially dry and stable composition of heat sensitive 
materials, in particular a composition containing at least 
10⁷ viable microbial cells per gram. Modern industrial processes require starter cultures 
(yeasts and bacteria) with well-defined properties in order 
to generate end products with constant quality. Frozen as 
well as (freeze-)dried formulations are used for this 
purpose. The main advantage of dried over frozen micro-organisms 
is the lower transport and storage costs of the 
cultures. For industrial use, large quantities of active 
cells are required. Freeze-drying is generally not considered 
to be an attractive method for the preparation of these large 
quantities, due to its high cost and inherent complexity. Potentially, convective drying methods, such as spray-drying 
and fluidized bed drying, are more economical. However, 
a major disadvantage of convective drying is that a 
considerable part of the cells is inactivated during drying 
due to the required high air temperatures. It is generally 
assumed this thermal inactivation is the main reason for 
inactivation during convective drying, although it was shown 
that the inactivation of Lb. plantarum during fluidized bed 
drying was caused by thermal inactivation as well as by the 
dehydration itself (Lievense et al. 1991). Thus, inactivation 
during convective drying can be caused by two mechanisms, 
thermal inactivation and dehydration-inactivation. The main convective drying methods, i.e. spray-drying, 
fluidized bed drying and spray granulation, have several 
advantages and disadvantages among each other. A major 
advantage of spray-drying is that no additional processing 
steps are needed, and the concentrated biomass can be dried  
 
directly. A disadvantage of spray-drying is that in principle 
the drying time is fixed by the dimensions of the drier. The 
specific heat of evaporation must be supplied in a relatively 
short time and thus high inlet temperatures are required. 
This can result in a significant thermal inactivation of the 
cells. Alternatively, fluidized bed and spray granulation 
drying offer the freedom of choosing the drying time and thus 
the air temperature. Therefore, thermal inactivation can be 
minimized. However, these latter processes require a support 
material and/or additional processing steps. A method of drying micro-organisms by means of Contact 
Sorption Drying (CSD) is known from EP-A-298605 (Unilever). 
The concept of CSD is that
