<ABSTRACT>
A communication system comprises a number of subscribers connected in common to a base-station (1). Each subscriber may use an interface device termed a subscriber access device too (or SAD). The subscribers and the base-station communicate via duplex of dual simplex spread-spectrum channels, each channel comprising an up-link from a subscriber to the base-station and a down-link from the base-station to the subscriber. The base-station may transmit power control signals to respective subscriber stations on their down-links. The subscriber stations in response to the power control signal from the down-link modifies its transmission signal power following a feed back control strategy. The subscriber stations may also be arranged to transmit power control signals to the base-station to modify the powers of transmissions from the base-station. The communications systems may be implemented as a spread-spectrum cellular radio system. The cells of the system may be made dynamically resizable.

<DESCRIPTION>
SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROLBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a communication system in which a number of subscriber stations communicate via a node or base-station on a common transmission medium. Such a system might be used, for example, in a digital radio network of the type proposed for PCN (personal communications network) systems. It has been proposed to use direct-sequence spread- spectrum transmitters for digital radio networks used, for example, for transmitting analogue voice and video information and also digital data. In such a system a number of subscriber access devices (SADs) communicate with the central base-station using, for example, code division multiple-access (CDMA) ormultiple-divisionmultiple-access (MDMA) , which is a novel form of multiplexing related to CDMA and described in the present applicant's co-pending International Application PCT/GB 93/00199 entitled "Communication System" and filed 29th January 1993.For the reasons discussed in further detail below, when using such direct-sequence spread-spectrum techniques it is desirable to be able to control the transmission power at least of the subscriber stations, and optionally also of the base-station. Such power control makes it possible firstly to prevent the overloading of the base- station receivers by many simultaneous radio transmissions which are co-channel, i.e. all operate on the same allocated frequency band (the so-called near-far effect) , and secondly to limit spectrum pollution. Considering the near-far effect, without power control, transmitters which are nearer to the base-station would be received with a much higher power than transmitters which are further away and so these nearer transmissions would swamp the weaker ones, producing the so-called "near-far" effect and possibly overloading the base-station receiver. 

 The second main reason for using power control of each transmitter is to reduce the total power which is radiated beyond the perimeter of the network cell served by the base-station so that "spectrum pollution" is minimised. This is important for two reasons. Firstly, by reducing the power of level of spurious emissions, the interference range to other radio systems which are sharing the same frequency band is minimised and this improves the overall coverage area of the system, calculated on the basis of mutual non-interference operation. Secondly, it minimises co-channel interference to adjacent cells of the network and reduces the
