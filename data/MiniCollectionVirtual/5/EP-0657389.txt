Process for the biological cleaning of water, in particular
of pre-cleaned water, in a floating grain filter (1) flowed through from

bottom to top, in which the floating grain is separated from the pure
water collecting above through a perforated floor (3), whereby the untreated

water to be cleaned is supplied with the gas necessary for biological
cleaning and the floating grain (2) polluted by the biological

cleaning is rinsed, whereby pollutants separated during the rinsing of
the floating grain (2) are collected in a sludge thickener (14) formed

at the lower end of the floating grain filter (1), characterized in
that, in the course of the continuous bio-filtration of the untreated

water (12), the floating grain (2) is supplied in a circuit, whereby
part of the pure water (5) is continuously removed with a floating grain

component at the top of the spherically shaped perforated floor (3) and
introduced into the feed for untreated water while the floating grain

component also carried along is rinsed.
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
gas necessary for the biological cleaning is continuously mixed with the

untreated water being supplied to the floating grain filter (1).
Process in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that
the gas necessary for the biological cleaning is admixed in excess,

whereby unconverted gas is collected in a gas cushion (8) above the pure
water.
Process in accordance with claim 3, characterized in that
gas from the gas cushion (8) and/or a gas source is continuously mixed

with the untreated water.
Device for the biological cleaning of water, in particular
of pre-cleaned waste water, with a floating grain filter (1) in which a

perforated floor (3) is positioned for the delineation of the floating

grain area in respect of the pure water located above (5) and the lower
section of which forms a sludge thickener (14), whereby a delivery pipe

(13) for the untreated water to be cleaned (12) discharges below the
floating grain area, whereby a conveying device for floating grain (2) 

and pure water (5) is provided which comprises a connecting pipe (17)
leading into the delivery pipe (13), characterized in that the connecting

pipe proceeds from the top of the spherically shaped perforated
floor (3).
Device in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that
the conveying unit comprises a jet pump (18) operated by the untreated

water (12).
Device in accordance with claim 5 or 6, characterized in
that a gas injector (19) is provided for the gas necessary for the

biological cleaning from a gas cushion (8) located above the pure water
(5) and/or from a gas source in the feed pipe (13).
Device in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that a
gas flowmeter (22) is connected with the gas injector (19).
Device in accordance with one of claims 5 to 8, characterized
in that the feed pipe (13) exhibits a vorticing re-rinsing device

(20) downstream from the conveying unit.
Device in accordance with one of claims 5 to 9, characterized
in that a centred bounce plate (15) is provided above the mouth

(16) of the feed pipe (13) in the floating grain filter (1).
Device in accordance with claim 10, characterized in that
the bounce plate (15) is cone-shaped with the apex of the cone pointing

downwards.
Device in accordance with one of claims 5 to 11, characterized
in that the perforated bottom (3) is cone-shaped.
