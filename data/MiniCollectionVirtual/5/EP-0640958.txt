<ABSTRACT>
An acicular alloy base magnetic powder comprising 
iron and cobalt, which has a major particle size of not 

larger than 0.25 µm, an axial ratio of from 4 to 8, a cobalt 
content of from 8 to 50 % by weight based on the weight of 

iron and saturation magnetization of at least 120 emu/g 

after being kept standing at the temperature of 60°C and 
relative humidity of 90 % for a week, which has improved 

corrosion resistance and can provide a magnetic recording 
medium suitable for recording in the short wavelength range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to acicular alloy 
magnetic powder, 
and more particularly, it relates to acicular fine 
particle magnetic powder made of an alloy comprising iron 
and cobalt Since metal iron base magnetic powder has larger 
coercive force and saturation magnetization than iron oxide 
base magnetic powder and is suitable for high density recording, 
it is now practically used for producing a magnetic 
recording medium. Since the particle surfaces of metal iron base 
magnetic powder are very active and easily corroded, its 
handling is difficult, and further the magnetic recording 
medium comprising the metal iron base magnetic powder suffers 
from decrease of output characteristics under high  
 
temperature and high humidity conditions. This is apparent 
from the fact that the saturation magnetization of the metal 
iron base magnetic powder greatly decreases in several hours 
when the magnetic powder is placed in an atmosphere of 60°C 
and humidity of 90 %. DE-39 11 039 A1 published on October 26, 1989 discloses a 
metallic magnetic powder consisting essentially of iron and 
being prepared by using an acicular iron oxide hydrate powder as 
starting material applying cobalt ions on the surface of the 
starting material and reducing the thus obtained powder in a 
reducing atmosphere. The magnetic powder contains cobalt in an 
amount of at least 6 % by weight relative to iron and the 
coercive force of the powder is less than 1600 Oe (127,3 Ka/m). 
The axial ratio is within the range of 10 to 20. To improve the corrosion resistance of the metal 
iron magnetic powder, it is proposed to use an alloy of iron 
with other metal such as cobalt whereby a passive state film 
is formed on the particle surface. Standard methods for producing the alloy base 
magnetic powder include: 
(1) reduction of a co-precipitated material prepared 
from an iron salt and a cobalt salt which are added to 
an aqueous solution of oxalic acid, (2) thermal reduction of iron oxide particles on 
which surface, cobalt is deposited, (3) addition of a reducing agent to a solution 
comprising an iron salt and a cobalt salt,  (4) evaporation of metal in an inert gas to cause 
collision of the evaporated metal with the gas molecules, 
and  
 (5) reducing iron chloride and cobalt chloride 
both in vapor states in a mixture of hydrogen with nitrogen 
or argon to form metals. In the method (1), control of the composition of 
the particles is difficult. In the method (2), since the  
 
cobalt compound is formed on the iron
