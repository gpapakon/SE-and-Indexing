<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for supplying fresh gas in 
manual ventilation of a patient and a ventilator system (2) 

for carrying out the method, the supply of fresh gas to a 
breathing bag (8) being regulated. During inspiration, the 

breathing bag (8) is squeezed, imposing an inspiration on 
the patient. A detector (16) at the breathing bag (8) senses 

when the patient exhales, and an identical flow of gas is 
fed to the system via an inspiratory valve (26), said flow 

of fresh gas streaming into the breathing bag (8) and 
preventing expired gas from entering the breathing bag (8). 

An expiratory valve simultaneously opens to conduct expired 
gas out of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for supplying fresh gas,
for use with a ventilator system for manual
ventilation of a patient in which a breathing bag is
squeezed to impose an inspiration on the patient.The invention also relates to a ventilator system for
carrying out the method.Ventilator systems are used for facilitating, supporting or
imposing inspiration and expiration on a patient. Manual
ventilation is sometimes employed when inspiration and
expiration are imposed on the patient, i.e. the physician
controls the patient's inspiration and expiration with the
aid of a breathing bag. When the breathing bag is connected
to the patient's airways without any intermediate pressure
exchange system, the physician is able to feel the response
of the lungs to the action of the breathing bag. In other
words, the physician can be said to communicate directly
with the lungs. This is essential, particularly in
anesthesia where the anesthetist wishes to control the
entire respiratory process himself/herself.In US-A-3,794,027 is described a manual ventilation system
for anesthesia. The system comprises a breathing bag which
the physician squeezes to push air through a patient tube to
a patient, imposing inspiration on the patient. When the
physician relaxes her/his pressure on the breathing bag, air
from the patient can return through a carbon dioxide
absorber to the breathing bag. The whole time, the physician
can feel the way the patient is breathing. The bag must be
periodically detached from the system, emptied and refilled
with fresh gas to replace the gas re-breathed a plurality of
times by the patient. In the patient tube there are also two 
check valves, near the patient, which control the direction
of gas flow to and from the patient respectively.Periodic evacuation of the bag has numerous disadvantages.
It means that control over the patient's respiration
terminates during the time it takes to replace gas, and
replacement distracts the anesthetist's concentration from
the patient. Moreover, gas containing anesthetic leaks into
the operating-theatre and can have an adverse effect on
surgical staff.The object of the invention is to achieve a method which
avoids the above-described disadvantages and in which the
patient does not re-breathe her/his own expired gas, with no
loss of the physician's ability to communicate with the
lungs.Another object of the invention is to achieve a ventilator
system for carrying out the method and which facilitates
control of gas flow in the patient tube, making check
