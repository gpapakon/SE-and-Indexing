<DESCRIPTION>
 WAX ISOMERATE HAVING A REDUCED POUR POINT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention concerns the use of a high molecular weight polyalkylmethacrylate to reduce the pour point of a wax isomerate.2. Description of Related ArtThe addition of polyal yl ethacrylates to lubricating oils is known. For example, U.S. Patent 2,628,225 discloses that poly¬ alkylmethacrylates can be used as VI improvers and pour point depres¬ sants in lubricating oils. In addition, U.S. Patent 4,968,444 dis¬ closes that the pour point of a lubricating oil can be reduced by adding a mixture of acrylate or methacrylate polymers. Each polymer contains several acrylate or methacrylate esters. The molecular weight of both polymers ranges from 50,000 to 500,000. More recently, U.S. Patent 5,149,452 discloses that the pour point of a wax isomerate can be reduced by using a combination of low and high molecular weight polyalkylmethacrylates.However, these disclosures do not suggest reducing the pour point of a wax isomerate using the particular high molecular weight polyalkylmethacrylate described below.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a wax isomerate having a reduced pour point which comprises(a) a major amount of a wax isomerate, and(b) a minor amount of a polyalkylmethacrylate having a weight average molecular weight of at least 600,000, 

 wherein the isomerate thus formed has a lower pour point than would have been obtained using a polyalkylmethacrylate having a weight average molecul r weight below 600,000.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention requires a wax isomerate and a high molecular weight polyalkylmethacrylate.The wax isomerates used in this invention are the lubes fraction remaining following dewaxing the isomerate formed from isomerizing wax in the presence of a suitable catalyst under isomeri- zation conditions.The wax which is isomerized may originate from any number of sources. Synthetic waxes from Fischer-Tropsch processes may be used, as may be waxes recovered from the solvent or autorefrigerative dewax¬ ing of conventional hydrocarbon oils, or mixtures of these waxes. Waxes from dewaxing conventional hydrocarbon oils are commonly called slack waxes and usually contain an appreciable amount of oil. The oil content of these slack waxes can range anywhere from 0 to 45% or more, but usually from 5 to 30% oil.Iso erization is conducted over a catalyst containing a hydrogenating metal component—typically one from Group VI, or Group VIII, or mixtures thereof, preferably
