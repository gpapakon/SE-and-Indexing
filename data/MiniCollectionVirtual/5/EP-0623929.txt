<ABSTRACT>
2.1 It is an object of the present invention to reduce or avoid a loss of data caused by physical effects in a storage medium or by a geometrical deviation of data tracks in comparison with positions of data reading means (read head). 2.2 According to the invention, stored data are read out, and corresponding signals are compared with a set value. In developments, a so-called refresh mode can be effected when the read-out level lies below the set value. 2.3 The invention can be used, for example, in the case of analog or digital magnetic recording media, such as the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC).

Process for the supervision of recorded data in which these data are read out
from a storage medium, the level of read out data is confronted with a set value

and then a warning signal sets off when the level of read out data lies below the
set value, characterised in that the warning signal sets off a refresh mode during

which the recorded data are read out, their levels are adapted, and preferably
their corrected signals are processed also, and the refreshed data are written on

the same storage medium.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the storage medium is
formed as a tape or similarly, and that the refresh mode, compared to the

tape's normal functioning direction (Nb), is carried out in the opposite
direction to the tape's normal functioning (Am).
Process according to one of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that

at least one further writing head is provided next to the reading head (11)
as well as at least one further reading head beside the writing head (14)

and in that
the writing and reading heads can be permuted in such a way that the
normal recording direction of the tape (Nb) can be maintained during the

refresh mode.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that two
combined reading/writing heads, for example in a mechanical and/or

electronic way, can be exchanged to be able to maintain the normal
recording direction of the tape (Nb) during the refresh mode.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a partial
data loss at the end or at the beginning of the tape can be avoided by 

means of the memorisation of the selected data and by the correct reading
of the refreshed data of the tape (10).
Device for supervislon of the recorded data (1,...,4), in which these data are read
out from a storage medium (10) by a reading head (11), and in which a receiver

is provided (17) that compares the level of read out data with a set value and that
generates a warning signal when the level of read out data lies below the set

value, characterised in that

if the warning signal takes place, the receiver (17) produces a refresh mode,
in which the recorded data (1,...,4) are read out by reading means (11), the

corrected signals are processed according to the read out data regarding
their adjusted level, and preferably to their data contents also, using

processing means (12, 17), and in that
the refreshed data are written using writing means (14) on the same storage
medium (10).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that

the storage medium is formed as a tape (10) or similarly, and in that
the receiver (17) and the impulse means work in such a way that the
refresh mode is carried out in the opposite direction to that of the

recording of the tape, compared with the normal recording direction of
the tape.
Device according to one of claims 6 or 7, characterised in that

at least one further writing head is provided beside the reading head
(11) as well as at least one further reading head beside the writing head

(14) and in that
a commutation device commutes the writing and reading heads in such
a way that the normal functioning direction of the tape (Nb) can be

maintained during the refresh mode.
