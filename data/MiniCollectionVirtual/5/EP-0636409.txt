<ABSTRACT>
Cobalt catalysts whose catalitically active composition consists of from 55 to 98% by wt. of cobalt, from 0.2 to 15% by wt. of phosphorus, from 0.2 to 15% by wt. of manganese and from 0.2 to 15% by wt. of alkali, calculated as oxide, by calcining the catalyst composition in a first step at final temperatures of from 550 to 750 DEG C and in a second step at final temperatures of from 800 to 1000 DEG C and also a process for hydrogenating organic nitriles and/or imines by use of the new cobalt catalysts.
