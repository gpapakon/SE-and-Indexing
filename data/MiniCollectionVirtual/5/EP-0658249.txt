<ABSTRACT>
Cell for resistivity measurement of a strip or elastic fibre sample (E) using four electric wires (12) each having an end portion. The cell comprises a cylinder (24) and the wire ends are bent so as to each form a loop (44) about the cylinder, terminated by a hook (45) and having a folded portion (43) at a junction with another part of the wire. The sample is clamped by means of loops to the cylinder when the hooks are slid onto the folded portion.

<CLAIMS>
Cell for measuring the resistivity of a 
sample (E) in band or flexible fibre form, by means of 

four electrical wires (12) each having an end, characterized 
in that it comprises a cylinder (24) and in that the 

ends of the wires are curved and each form a loop (44) 
which passes around the cylinder (24), which loop (44) 

ends in a hook (45) and comprises a fold (43) at a 
junction with another part of the wire (12), the hooks 

being designed to be slid into the folds and to clamp the 
sample (E) on the cylinder (24). 
Cell according to Claim 1, having an associated 
furnace (10) and comprising an enclosure (3) in which the 

cylinder and the sample are housed, characterized by a 
device (1) for moving the enclosure while making it at 

least partially enter the furnace and exit the furnace. 
Cell according to Claim 2, in which the enclosure 
is essentially in the form of a vertically arranged 

hollow cylinder, characterized in that the enclosure is 
suspended from the device for moving it by a bellows (5). 
Cell according to Claim 3, characterized by a 
means (21, 24), included in the enclosure, for suspending 

the units. 
Cell according to Claim 1, characterized by 
thermal barriers (25) partitioning the enclosure into 

compartments between the units and an exit of the 
enclosure. 
Cell according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the enclosure is leaktight and is provided with means (2, 

4, 8) for replacing the atmosphere which it contains or 
for establishing a vacuum.  

 
Cell according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the cylinder comprises four grooves (46) for receiving 

the four loops.
