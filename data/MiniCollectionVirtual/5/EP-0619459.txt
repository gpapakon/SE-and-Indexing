<ABSTRACT>
The pressure head needed to drive combustion air into 
the combustion region (46) of a heat gun 930) is imparted 

to the air by a compressor blades (36) driven by a turbine 
whose blades (32) are interposed in the fuel conduit that 

leads to the combustion region (46). The expansion of the 
gaseous fuel, which is obtained from a pressurized source, 

provides the power to impose the necessary pressure head. 
The turbine-compressor combination is efficient enough 

that it can extract from the fuel flow enough power to 
maintain the necessary pressure head not only on the 

combustion gas (A₁), which flows through vents (44) in a 
manifold (43), but also on a larger volume of air (A₂) 

delivered downstream of the combustion region (46) to 
dilute the combustion products and thereby cool them to 

the desired heat-gun output temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to heating devices 
that rely on the combustion of high pressure gaseous fuels 
such as liquid petroleum gases or high pressure natural 
gas, particularly where portability is important such as 
with a heat gun. Numerous heating applications in home and in industry 
require a heat gun as a high velocity source of moderately 
hot air. For example, direct heating of objects in 
processes such as paint removal or shrink wrapping 
plastics require moderate temperature to avoid charring or 
overheating while high velocity-enhances heat transfer. A conventional heat gun relies on electrical fans to 
move the air heated by combustion of fuel gas. The 
drawback of these devices is the added weight of the 
electrical motors and inability to use these units in the 
field where electricity is not available. A different, commercially highly successful heat gun 
is described in a previous patent of Zagoroff, a 
coinventor of the current invention, U.S. Patent No. 
3,779,694, HEAT GUN, granted September 23, 1973. The fuel. 
jet pressurizes combustion air in a jet pump, feeding the 
mixture into an internal combustor. In the combustor, the 
gases expand by the addition of heat of combustion and 
exit as a high velocity jet of exhaust gases at 
stoichiometric burning temperature of over 3000°F and 
discharge velocities exceeding 4000 feet per minute. This 
jet entrains and propels copious amounts of ambient air in 
a second jet pump to create a blast of heated air at 
moderate temperatures. By virtue of the combustion at  
 
elevated pressure, a portion of the combustion energy of 
the fuel is converted to mechanical energy of the exhaust 
gases which augments the power available to pump air in 
the secondary jet pump. The overall mechanical efficiency of the jet pump 
heat gun to move air suffers from the inherently low 
efficiency of the jet pump, typically less than 20%. The 
overall pumping efficiency of the two pumps in series is 
thus only 20% x 20% = 4%. Another drawback of the device 
is the great mixing lengths required for acceptable 
performance which increases the bulk of the device. It is therefore an object of his invention to provide 
a heating device that relies on a gaseous fuel as the sole 
energy source and which is mechanically efficient in 
converting the heat and kinetic energy of the jet of 
gaseous fuel to a high speed jet of hot air. Occasionally, gas turbines built for jet propulsion 
have been employed for emergency space heating in the 
field. In the
