<ABSTRACT>
A panel structure comprises building panels (10) arranged in an edge-to-edge abutting relationship, each comprising a panel (12) of polymer concrete having a repeating relief pattern (18) in the exposed face thereof. The relief pattern imitates the appearance of brickwork and repeats itself substantially without interruption across the joints between the panels. Each panel (10) further comprises a supporting framework (14) of timber affixed to the rear face of the polymer concrete panel, and a heat insulating material (16) in voids formed by the framework.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panel structure 
of the type as defined in the preamble of claim 1. It is often desired to provide the exposed 
face of a building structure with a repeating pattern 
which gives the structure the appearance of having been 
built from bricks and mortar or by some other 
traditional building method which results in a 
repeating surface pattern. The approach heretofore has 
been to provide such a building structure with a 
structural part which alone is sufficient to give the 
structure its strength and then to clad this structural 
part with cladding panels which give the structure its 
desired appearance. The erection of such a structure 
is therefore essentially a two-part operation, the 
first being to erect the strength-giving structural 
part and the second being the installation of the 
cladding panels. An example of such a prior art structure can 
be found in US-A-4 299 069. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a structure whose erection, essentially is a 
one-part operation, consisting of the fastening 
together of panels to form the structure, the panels 
themselves giving the structure its structural strength 
as well as the desired appearance, and where, with no 
or little additional work, the joint between adjacent 
panels is effectively concealed. According to the invention there is provided 
a panel structure comprising first and second panels 
which are arranged in an edge-to-edge abutting 
relationship to form a joint between the panels, each 
panel having a repeating relief pattern in an exposed  
 
front face thereof, which relief pattern repeats itself 
substantially without interruption across the joint, 
characterised therein that each panel comprises a 
structural panel of polymer concrete having said relief 
pattern formed in the front face thereof, and a 
framework secured to and standing proud of the rear 
face of the polymer concrete panel, and that the first 
and second panels are secured together by fasteners 
which engage with the respective frameworks. The polymer concrete panel of the first panel 
may have recesses therein, and the panel structure may 
further comprise panel elements which extend from the 
polymer concrete panel of the second panel into the 
recesses, the panel elements forming part of the relief 
pattern. The recesses may be in the front face of the 
polymer concrete panel of the first panel, the panel 
elements overlying the polymer concrete panel of the 
first panel. There may be recesses in the front

<CLAIMS>
A panel structure comprising first and second 
panels which are arranged in an edge-to-edge abutting 

relationship to form a joint between the panels, each 
panel (10) having a repeating relief pattern (18) in an 

exposed front face thereof, which relief pattern 
repeats itself substantially without interruption 

across the joint, characterised therein that each panel 
comprises a structural panel (12) of polymer concrete 

having said relief pattern formed in the front face 
thereof, and a framework (14) secured to and standing 

proud of the rear face of the polymer concrete panel 
(12), and that the first and second panels (10) are 

secured together by fasteners (32) which engage with 
the respective frameworks (14). 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised therein that the polymer concrete panel 

(12) of the first panel has recesses (20, 42) therein, 
and that the panel structure further comprises panel 

elements (36, 40, 44) which extend from the polymer 
concrete panel (12) of the second panel into the 

recesses, the panel elements forming part of the relief 
pattern. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised therein that the recesses (20) are in the 

front face of the polymer concrete panel (12) of the  
 

first panel, and that the panel elements (36, 40) 
overlie the polymer concrete panel (12) of the first 

panel. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised therein that there are recesses (20) in 

the front face of the polymer concrete panel (12) of 
the second panel, and that the panel elements (36) 

extend into the recesses (20) of, and overlie, the 
polymer concrete panel (12) of the second panel. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised therein that the panel elements (36) are 

secured in position by means of an adhesive. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 5, 
characterised therein that the adhesive is of a type 

that remains yieldable after it has set. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised therein that the adhesive is a 

polysulphide adhesive. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised therein that the panel elements (40) are 

integral with the second panel. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised therein that the recesses (42) are in the 

edge of the polymer concrete panel (12) of the first 
panel, so as to give the edge a toothed configuration. 
A panel structure as claimed in any one of 
claims 2 to 9, characterised therein that the relief 

pattern (18) is such as to imitate the appearance of  
 

brickwork, and that the panel elements (36, 40, 44) are 
each rectangular to imitate the appearance of a brick. 
A panel structure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, characterised therein that each 

panel (10) further comprises a sheet of fabric (22) 
attached to and spanning the framework (14), the fabric 

being embedded in a resin which is bonded to the 
polymer concrete of the polymer concrete panel (12). 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 11, 
characterised therein that each panel (10) further 

comprises a heat insulating material (16) in voids 
formed by the respective framework (14). 
A panel structure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, characterised therein that the 

panels (10) each have a groove (26) along the abutting 
edges thereof, the grooves being in register with one 

another and there being a sealing strip (34) which 
extends from one of the grooves into the other. 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 13, 
characterised therein that the sealing strip (34) is 

embedded in a sealing substance in each of the grooves 
(26). 
A panel structure as claimed in claim 14, 
characterised therein that the sealing substance is a 

polysulphide sealant. 
A building panel for use in a panel structure 
as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterised therein that it comprises a polymer  
 

concrete panel (12) of polymer concrete having said 
relief pattern formed in the front face thereof, and a 

framework (14) secured to and standing proud of the 
rear face of the polymer concrete panel.
