<ABSTRACT>
The basic idea of the invention is not only to dispense with the cross-linking of the solid dispersed phase in the dispersing agent, but to use the solid dispersed phase as matrix of matrices into which macro-particles are incorporated. The dispersing agent is then chemically set, but an excess of setting agent is added, so that the preproduct may be transformed into the desired material by adding dispersing agent at a later date. For that purpose, a body capable of forming a matrix is prepared and formed with filler-like macro-particles, soloxide (cross-linking agent) and a buffer for promoting the formation of the matrix of matrices. This body is then processed. It may be pigmented, so that a great variety of different compositions may be obtained by adding a variant mixture to the body. Two successive steps allow the appropriately prepared body to be transformed into the desired material: a hydrating and balancing step and a subsequent setting and stabilising step.

Process for producing semifinished products for
solid mineral working materials, with the aid of the solgel-technique;

based on sol oxiides, polysilicates and
fillers, 
characterized by
 the following process steps:

a) bringing together and processing a first component
(A) of a base material, which serves as a filler

portion and comprises fillers in the form of macroparticles,
which are larger by many times than the

particles of the disperse phase of the sol-gel
colloid, a second component (B) of a base material,

which serves as reactive portion and comprises an
acid, and a third component (C) of a base material,

which serves as buffer portion and comprises sol
oxide and also polysilicate, giving a base material

(ABC),
b) hydrating this base material (ABC) by mixing with a
hydrating agent, until a balanced substance is

formed which is essentially becoming dry and is
similar to granules,
c) setting and stabilizing this substance by mixing
with a hydration agent in such a way that an excess

of hydrating agent remains, giving a stabilized,
storage-stable, reactive semifinished product.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the first component (A) of the base material is
composed of borosilicate glass, quartz glass or glass 

sand or foundry sand or mineral sands or aluminium oxide
or an organic or inorganic fibre or of a mixture of two

or more of these fillers.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the second component (B) of the base material
comprises sol oxide.
Process according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the sol oxide content is increased with addition to
the silica sol of an amount of oxide which has not been

made into a sol, and gelling is delaid by solling on.
Process. according to any one of Claims 1-4,

characterized in that
 a modifying mixture (V), which
comprises pigmenting agents, is produced and may be

introduced into the base material (ABC) or into the
second component (B) of the base material, making it

possible to vary the material characteristics of the end
product.
Process according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the modifying mixture (V) comprises a hydrating
agent which promotes or brings about the hydration of the

base material (ABC).
Process according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized
in that
 the modifying mixture (V) is produced from one or
more premixes (V1, V2).
Process according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 the premixes (V1, V2) have an acid or basic component,
such as phosphoric acid or boric acid and

hydroxides or carbonates, respectively, or are admixed
with premixes with acid or basic components.
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 8,

characterized in that
 in the case of additions for
achieving a pigmented component of the base material

(ABC), an acid is added which, after a reaction time,
brings about pigmentation of the component.
Process according to any one of Claims 1-9,

characterized in that
 hydroxides or carbonates are used
as hydrating agents.
Process according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
that
 the hydration agent is a metasilicace (K or Na 
metasilicate) or a cement, such as white cement or

Portland cement.
Process according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
that
 the carbonates used are Ca carbonate, Mg carbonate,
Al carbonate, Ti carbonate, Zr carbonate or their

hydrogencarbonates, alone or in a mixture.
Process according to Claim 10, 
characterised in
that
 the hydroxides used are Ca hydroxide, Mg hydroxide,
Al hydroxide, Ti hydroxide or Zr hydroxide, alone or in

a mixture.

pigmentation to the premixes (V1, V2), to the modifying

mixtures (V) or to the base material (ABC).
Process according to Claim 14, 
characterized in
