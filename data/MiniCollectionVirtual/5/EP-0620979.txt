<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a low fat, 
transparent, stable oat protein containing aqueous solution comprising: 

preparing an initial stable, translucent aqueous suspension comprising water, 
an insoluble liquid fraction, a stable, soluble oat protein fraction, a soluble oat 

fat fraction, and a soluble oat carbohydrate fraction, wherein the oat fat is 
dissociated from the oat protein; removing the insoluble liquid fraction from 

the initial suspension; and recovering the stable, soluble oat protein fraction, 
soluble oat fat fraction, and soluble oat carbohydrate fraction in a final low fat, 

transparent, stable aqueous solution. The present invention further relates to 

the low fat, transparent, stable aqueous solution of the above process and a 
solid mixture containing a stable, soluble oat protein fraction in purified form 

which provides for a low fat, transparent, stable aqueous solution when put 
into solution in water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a low fat,
transparent, stable oat protein containing aqueous solution. The present
invention also relates to the aqueous solution product of this process and a
solid, purified oat protein containing mixture which when placed in solution
provides for a transparent, stable oat protein containing aqueous solution.The oat seed from which the oat grain is taken comprises an oat hull
and an oat groat. The oat hull serves as an outer covering of the groat. The
oat groat is comprised of oat bran,
including the pericarp and the aleurone layers, germ and endosperm. It is
desirable to fractionate the oat groat into its soluble and insoluble fractions
because each fraction of the groat has value in and of itself. Specifically of
interest is the water soluble fraction of the groat which contains oat protein
in a concentrated form. The oat protein in the fraction has many beneficial
uses, including use in cosmetics and hair care and skin care formulations such
as lotions, shampoos,creams and gels. However, aqueous compositions
comprising oat protein fractions typically contain insoluble material, and as
such are translucent and cannot be used in clear formulations, e.g., shampoos
and beverages.Also of interest are low fat, oat protein containing aqueous solutions
and solid mixtures used to prepare aqueous solutions. These are useful as
additives and protein supplements in low fat food items. Additionally, it is
believed that such low fat oat protein containing compositions and mixtures
will be more stable since they are likely less susceptible to rancidity. This is
because they contain less fat for oxidation, which is the cause of rancidity.
Unfortunately, such low fat oat protein containing compositions are also
translucent, and therefore are not aesthetically pleasing when added to clear
formulations such as beverages. Furthermore, low fat, oat protein containing solutions have a greater
concentration of protein as compared to full fat formulations. This translates
into a greater protein yield, and the corresponding economy of efficient
operation.Given the foregoing, it would be desirable to prepare a transparent oat
protein containing aqueous solution and solid mixture which is transparent
when in solution, and which can be used in clear cosmetic and hair and skin
care formulations. It would also be desirable if such aqueous solution and
solid mixture fraction were low in fat as well. However, to date the known
processes for preparing oat protein containing
