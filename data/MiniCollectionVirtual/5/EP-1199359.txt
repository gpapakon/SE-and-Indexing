<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to human metabotropic glutamate receptor (hmGluR) proteins,
isolated nucleic acids coding therefor, host cells producing the proteins of the invention,
methods for the preparation of such proteins, nucleic acids and host cells, and uses thereof.
Furthermore, the invention provides antibodies directed against the hmGluR proteins of the
invention.Metabotropic glutamate receptors (hmGluR) belong to the class of G-protein (guanine nucleotide
binding protein) coupled receptors which upon binding of a glutamatergic ligand may
transduce an extracellular signal via an intracellular second messenger system such as
calcium ions, a cyclic nucleotide, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate into a physiological
response. Possessing seven putative transmembrane spanning segments, preceded
by a large extracellular amino-terminal domain and followed by a large carboxy-terminal
domain metabotropic glutamate receptors are characterized by a common structure. Based
on the degree of sequence identity at the amino acid level the class of mGluR can be divided
into different subfamilies comprising individual receptor subtypes (Nakanishi, Science 258,
597-603 (1992)). Each mGluR subtype is encoded by a unique gene. Regarding the
homology of an individual mGluR subtype to another subtype of a different subfamily, the
amino acid sequences are less than about 50% identical. Within a subfamily the degree of
sequence identity is generally less than about 70 %. Thus a particular subtype may be
characterized by its amino acid sequence homology to another mGluR subtype, especially a
subtype of the same mammalian species. Furthermore, a particular subtype may be
characterized by its region and tissue distribution, its cellular and subcellular expression
pattern or by its distinct physiological profile, e.g. by its electrophysiological and
pharmacological properties.The amino acid L-glutamate being the major excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamatergic
systems are presumed to play an important role in numerous neuronal processes including
fast excitatory synaptic transmission, regulation of neurotransmitter releases, long-term
potentation, leaming and memory, developmental synaptic plasticity, hypoxic-ischemic
damage and neuronal cell death, epileptiform seizures, as well as the pathogenesis of
several neurodegenerative disorders. Up to today, no information is available on human 
metabotropic glutamate receptor (hmGluR) subtypes, e.g. on their amino acid sequence or
tissue distribution. This lack of
