<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
drug delivery and, particularly, to the administration
of various pharmaceutical agents to a patient through
the eye by application of the innovative compositions
of these agents in a non-irritating submicron
emulsion.The primary problem associated with topical
applications of drugs to the eye is that the human eye
is a very sensitive organ and any substance which is
not compatible with it causes irritation and pain.
This evokes blinking and reflex-tearing, which is a
physiological reaction intended for removal of the
irritating substance from the ocular surface.
Irritation is a major cause of poor patient compliance
with many ophthalmic drugs. This phenomenon is
aggravated by the need to include relatively high
concentrations of a drug in such ophthalmic
compositions in order to obtain a therapeutic effect,
since bioavailability of topically applied ophthalmic
drugs is generally very poor. Thus, there is no doubt
that a reduction in the irritating effect of a drug
will enable increased ocular drug bioavailability,
increased patient compliance with the drug, and
enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the drug.Currently, aqueous solutions are by far the most
common vehicles for ophthalmic drugs. Such vehicles
have a serious drawback, however, in that the ocular
bioavailability of drugs administered thereby is
generally very poor due to rapid drainage and tear
turnover. See Fitzgerald et al. (1987) J. Pharm. 
Pharmacol. 39:487-490. A typical dose of ophthalmic
solution is in the range of about 50-100 µl, which far
exceeds the normal lachrymal volume of about
7-10 µl. Thus, the portion of the dose that is not
eliminated by spillage from the pulberal fissure is
quickly drained. Furthermore, lachrymation and
physiological tear turnover, which in humans is about
16% per minute under normal conditions, increases
after the introduction of the solution, resulting in
rapid dilution of the remaining amount of drug that
has not been spilled or drained. As a consequence,
the contact time with the absorbing surfaces of the
eye (i.e., the cornea and sclera) of drugs which are
applied to the eye via liquid aqueous compositions is
less than about two minutes.Another drawback of aqueous vehicles is that many
drugs which may potentially be used in eye therapy are
hydrophobic and their delivery into the eye by such
aqueous vehicles is not possible. While such
hydrophobic drugs may potentially be administered to
the eye in conjunction with various organic solvents,
the use of such
