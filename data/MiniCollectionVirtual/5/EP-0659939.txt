<ABSTRACT>
A method for securing a close fitting preformed 
sleeve 12 onto a support surface 10. The sleeve 12 

is coated internally with adhesive and the adhesive is 
covered by a liquid layer, such as isopropanol to 

prevent the adhesive contacting the body 10 while the 
sleeve is being fitted thereon. The sleeve 

dimensions are no larger than the body and preferably 
smaller so as to provide the close fit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the method of 
application of sleeves to traffic guidance devices and 
in particular, road cones, cylinders and the like. Road cones (and other devices) have, for many 
years, been equipped with sleeves or bands of material 
which are often retro-reflective and/or contrast with 
the body colour of the cone so that the visual image 
presented, meets the prescribed requirements of the 
authorities controlling such items in the country of 
use. Generally, the method of achieving the 
application of the bands was by one of two methods. Method A - Pre-manufacture of a "sleeve" or "collar" 
such that it duplicated the tapered angles of the 
cone. Such a sleeve is first cut to shape as a flat 
projection of the desired band and the two ends of the 
flat shape are joined together for example by welding 
to form a three dimensional shape that can be slipped 
over the cone. Sometimes, such sleeves or collars 
are used only at night and thus are not permanently 
fixed to the cone by adhesive. Where such sleeves or 
collars are fixed to a cone by adhesive, a convenient 
method is to apply a small blob or area of adhesive to 
the cone body at an appropriate height within the area  
 
to be covered by the sleeve. The area coated by 
adhesive is normally substantially less than the whole 
area to be covered by the sleeve. Normally, the 
adhesive chosen is of a syrupy consistency and solvent 
based such that it allows some final adjustment of 
position of the sleeve relative to the cone. It will 
be understood by those who have practised this art 
that the greater the area of the cone covered by the 
sleeve, the greater is the requirement for the 
adhesive to cover a proportionally smaller area of the 
surface of the cone which is likely to contact the 
sleeve (or vice-versa) or, the more syrupy the 
adhesive must be at the time when the sleeve is fitted 
on to the cone. These provisions either permit the 
application of a large area sleeve by allowing the 
last area of the sleeve reaching the surface of the 
cone to be in that area where adhesive is present or 
because the adhesive properties allow the sleeve to be 
moved to its final position prior to final adhesion. 
In other words, the thicker, tackier or more 
aggressive the glue used, combined with the 
proportions of the area of the surface covered by the 
glue, the greater is the difficulty in fixing the 
sleeve in its correct position before the glue 
overcomes the efforts of the person attempting to fit 
it. The greater the area of

<CLAIMS>
A method for securing a preformed sleeve closely 
fitted onto a complementary support body wherein said 

sleeve and/or said body is coated at least in part 
with pressure sensitive adhesive, said method 

comprising the provision of a liquid layer between the 
adhesive on the sleeve and the surface of the body 

and/or sleeve so as to permit the sleeve to be moved 
relative to the support body and thereafter securing 

said sleeve to the body with the adhesive. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said 
preformed sleeve is comprised, at least in part, of a 

retro-reflective material. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein 
the preformed sleeve is formed by welding the ends of 

a flat strip together. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein 
the preformed sleeve is formed by gluing or 

mechanically fastening the ends of a flat strip 
together. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the area of the sleeve or body coated with 

 
pressure sensitive adhesive is greater than 10% of the 

available area. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the area of the sleeve or cone coated with 

pressure sensitive adhesive is greater than 90% of the 
available area. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the sleeve is flexible and/or elastic. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the sleeve is rigid at least in part. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein more than one colour is present in the sleeve. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein small holes are provided at intervals either 

in the body and/or in the sleeve whereby liquid and/or 
adhesive can escape from between the sleeve and the 

body. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the assembly of the sleeve on the body is 

effected manually. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the sleeve and/or body coated with pressure 

sensitive adhesive is provided with a protective 
release film. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the adhesive is substantially unaffected by 

water/rain once it has been allowed to develop its 
pressure sensitive or other adhesive characteristics. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the strength of the sleeve material is greater 

than the bond formed between the adhesive and the 
sleeve and/or the bond formed between the adhesive and 

the body. 
A method as claimed in Claim 14, wherein the 
strength of the sleeve material permits removal of 

said sleeve from the body by cutting said sleeve and 
peeling it from the body 
A method as claimed in Claim 15 wherein the 
strength of the sleeve is such that pieces of at least 

15% of the total sleeve area can be peeled from the 
body. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein the sleeve is marked to provide a visual 

effect preferably as prescribed . 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the preformed sleeve is not larger than the 

support body. 
A method as claimed in Claim 18, wherein the 
preferred sleeve is up to 10% smaller than the support 

body. 
A body such as a cone or other traffic guidance 
device which has applied to it a preformed sleeve 

attached by means of pressure sensitive adhesive said 
sleeve having been positioned in the desired place on 

the body by the use of a liquid forming a film between 
the adhesive and the surface of the sleeve or body. 
A preformed sleeve, receivable on a body, a 
plurality of apertures in the sleeve and/or the body, 

an excess of adhesive or adhesive solvent being 
applied to the sleeve and/or to the body whereby said 

excess adhesive or adhesive solvent permits the sleeve 
to be moved relative to the body into a predetermined 

 
position whereupon excess adhesive or adhesive solvent 

escapes or can be extruded through the said apertures 
in the film. 
A body such as a cone, bollard, cylinder or the 
like fitted with a sleeve in accordance with the 

method as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 17.
