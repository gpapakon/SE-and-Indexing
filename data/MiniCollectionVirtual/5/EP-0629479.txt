<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the continuous
processing of synthetic thermoplastics materials and more
particularly to an apparatus and a process for continuously pelletizing synthetic thermoplastic
materials in which both the distributive (extensive) and/or dispersive
(intensive) mixing performances
are improved.As used herein, the term "extensive" or "distributive" mixing
means the uniform distribution of particles within a matrix.
Distributive mixing can cover the distribution of non-interacting filler
particles.The term "intensive" or "dispersive" mixing refers to the
breaking down of gels or agglomerates.Pelletizing apparatuses generally provide the overall process by
which various thermoplastic materials are altered in form,
homogenized, mixed, alloyed and combined with additives. As a
result, the thermoplastic materials undergo molecular alterations,
often referred to as "tailoring". For most products, however, energy
input to the resin is kept at a minimum to avoid this effect.
Therefore, the pelletizing apparatus must have the ability to control the
amount of mixing and/or energy input to the thermoplastic material.In general, there are two types of pelletizing apparatuses, i.e., non-continuous
batch-type and continuous type pelletizing apparatuses.A pelletizing apparatus that uses a batch-type mixer such as a
"Banbury" mixer (as compared to continuous mixers such as the
Farrel "FCM") to melt and mix the thermoplastic material and an
extruder for melt pressurization is referred to as a two-stage batch-type
mixer/extruder pelletizing line.Such apparatuses have the ability to process a wide range of
thermoplastic materials and products that have a wide variation in
density, viscosity, etc., but have limited capacities. Further, the 
atmosphere surrounding the melting/mixing of the thermoplastic
material cannot be easily controlled using standard and proven
techniques. Therefore, they are of limited value for use in high-capacity
pelletizing apparatuses.In the early stages of development of polymer processing
equipment, continuous pelletizing apparatuses had the melting, mixing
and pressurization generation function combined in a single machine;
this is commonly referred to as a single-stage pelletizing line. An
example of such an apparatus is the commonly used, single screw,
plasticating extruder. Two-stage extruder/extruder pelletizing
apparatuses or tandem extruder pelletizing lines were also developed
which included a separate extruder for melting and mixing and
another extruder for melt

A continuous pelletizing apparatus for
pelletizing synthetic thermoplastic materials which

comprises:

(1) a melter/mixer (10) for at least partially
melting and mixing synthetic thermoplastic material;
(2) a gear pump (28) for increasing
pressurisation of the melted synthetic thermoplastic

material;
(3) an independently controlled secondary mixer
(42) operatively coupled with the gear pump (28)

including means for providing additional independent
mixing of the molten synthetic thermoplastic material

with a rate of shear commensurate with that required
to substantially remove gels and agglomerates from a

thermoplastic resin and/or depolymerise such a resin;
and
(4) a pelletizer (86) for forming pellets of
synthetic material:
