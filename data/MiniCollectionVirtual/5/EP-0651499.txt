<ABSTRACT>
An AC/DC converter includes a rectifying circuit 
(D1), a main switching device constituted by an N-channel 

IGBT (QM1) or an N-channel FET (QM2), a control 
circuit (17), a booster circuit (18), and a series 

power supply circuit (11). The rectifying circuit (D1) 
rectifies a half wave of an input AC voltage (AC
IN
). 
One end of the current path of the main switching device 

(QM1 or QM2) is supplied with a half-wave rectifying 
output from the rectifying circuit (D1). The control 

circuit (17) turns on the main switching device (QM1 or 
QM2) when a voltage between the gate and the other end 

of the main switching device (QM1 or QM2) exceeds a 
first level, and turns off the main switching device 

(QM1 or QM2) when the voltage exceeds a second level 
which is higher than the first level. The booster circuit 

(18) boosts the voltage between the gate and the 
other end of the main switching device (QM1 or QM2) to a 

level which is higher than the second level when the 
voltage exceeds the first level. The series power supply 

circuit (11) has an input terminal to which the 
other end of the current path of the main switching 

device (QM1 or QM2) is connected, and outputs a DC 
voltage (V
OUT
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an AC/DC converter
for rectifying a commercial AC power supply voltage or
converting a commercial AC power supply voltage to a
stable DC voltage and, in particular, to an AC/DC converter
for use in a transformerless power supply of the
industrial-consumer field. Document EP-A-0 327 174 A1 describes a circuit
arrangement for deriving a direct voltage from an alternating
voltage, particularly the mains alterning voltage, said
circuit arrangement comprising: a switching transistor whose
main current path is connected via a rectifier diode between
the input and the output and whose control electrode is
controlled by a thyristor. Further, the gate electrode of the
thyristor is connected via a diac to a time-determining
circuit comprising a series arrangement of a resistor and a
capacitor, whilst a diode is arranged across the capacitor in
such a way that this diode conducts during the periods when
the rectifier diode is blocked.Document EP-A-0 500 113 A2 relates to a power-supply
unit. In an electric appliance including an electronic
circuit, step-down of the commercial power source voltage is
carried out by taking electric power in a predetermined
region of a phase-angel from the commercial power source only
with an electronic circuit without use of a transformer. HV-2405E of HARRIS is placed on the market as an
AC/DC converter for use in a transformerless power
supply. Its detailed specifications and circuit
arrangement are shown in File Number 2487 of the
brochure of HV-2405E.The AC/DC converter of HV-2405E includes a double-gate
thyristor serving as a main switching device. A
commercial AC power supply voltage (hereinafter referred
to as AC power supply voltage) is applied to the double-gate
thyristor. When the AC power supply voltage
exceeds a predetermined value of about 3 VF, the
thyristor is turned on, and this turn-on state is
maintained during a period of time corresponding to a
positive sinusoidal half wave of the AC power supply
voltage. During a period of time corresponding to a
negative sinusoidal half wave thereof, the current
flowing through the thyristor is smaller than a holding
current, and the thyristor is turned off, thereby
maintaining this turn-off state.Since, however, the thyristor serving as a main 
switching device of the AC/DC converter is of a latch
type, there is a possibility that the AC/DC converter
cannot be regulated if a current flowing through a load
is increased suddenly at a frequency which is higher
than a commercial frequency. More
