<ABSTRACT>
An operator/facsimile interface enables entry of alpha-numeric 
data from a telephone-style keyboard (58). 

Alteration of displayed alpha-numeric characters may be 
accomplished by actuation of arrow keys (78), or sequential 

key presses of an alpha-numeric key (58). A displayed 
alpha-numeric character may be entered by actuation of an 

arrow key (78), an Enter key (64) or a different alpha-numeric 
key (58). Completion of an alpha-numeric entry may 

be signaled by actuation of a Start key (66) or Enter key 
(64). The operator/facsimile interface enables a telephone 

number to be stored for subsequent recall by any of five 
separate procedure pathways. The combination of the above 

operator/facsimile interface features provides the operator 
with plural pathways to accomplish facsimile functions, 

thereby avoiding the single path per procedure prior art 

constraint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telecommunication unit, for
example a facsimile apparatus, which includes an operator
interface that provides multiple, alternative, input paths
to accomplish procedures employed by the facsimile.Other aspects of the subjects matter of this application
are covered in our copending European patent publication
No. EP-A-0 653 875 and EP-A-0 649 243
filed the same day as this application.Once a facsimile machine has been properly set up by the
operator, it operates in a substantially automatic mode to
accomplish its connection, transmission and sign-off
functions. If the facsimile includes a "one-touch" feature
wherein actuations of each of a plurality of single buttons
accesses prestored telephone numbers, the transmitting fax
machine, upon actuation of one such button, automatically
dials the remote telephone number and transmits a standard
recognition signal which the receiving facsimile
acknowledges. Then, the transmitting and receiving
facsimiles send short messages back and forth to select the
highest speed possible before sending the documents. No
action is required of an operator during this action, at 
either the sending or the receiving end. When a
transmission is completed, the facsimile units
automatically disconnect and the receiving facsimile
provides hard copy for the operator.While transmission and reception operations of a facsimile
are highly automated and require little or no operator
input, such "user-friendliness" is often not manifest when
an operator wishes to input instructions or data into the
facsimile via a control panel. Facsimile/operator
interfaces typically recognize only a single sequence of
operations to accomplish a given input task. To determine
the correct procedure sequence, the operator must refer to
an instruction manual and follow its instructions slavishly
to assure proper accomplishment of a desired task. Any
deviation from the required sequence of operations will
prevent the accomplishment of the desired task.Facsimile operator panels employ multiple keys that enable
multiple functions to be accomplished - assuming the
operator is aware of the proper sequence of key
activations. Because of both cost and size restraints,
little directory information is contained on the face of
the operator panel other than short key names. Certain key
names are ambiguous and lead to user confusion as to the
exact function to be performed by the key.For any given facsimile task, there are usually a number of
different "reasonable" approaches an operator

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunication unit including an operator panel
(50) with a telephone-style, alpha-numeric keyboard (52), a

subset of keys (58) in said keyboard (52) each having plural-assigned
alphabetic characters in addition to a numeric

character assignment, said operator panel further having up,
down, right and left arrow keys (78), an Enter key (64) and a

display panel (54), said arrow keys providing movement
control of a cursor on said display panel, said

telecommunication unit further comprising:

means (70, 76, 78) for initiating an alpha-numeric entry
mode of operation for said telecommunication unit, said

alpha-numeric mode enabling entry of alphabetic and
numeric characters into character positions in said

display panel (54); and
processor means (10) responsive to an alpha-numeric key
actuation during said alpha-numeric mode to cause said

display panel (54) to manifest a character assigned to
said actuated key, 
characterised by
 additionally
providing that actuation of said arrow key (78) causes a

character position in said display panel (54) to
manifest other alpha-numeric characters assigned to said

actuated key.
The telecommunication unit as recited in claim 1,
wherein repeated actuations of one said arrow key (78) cause

a first sequential display in a display panel character
position of alpha-numeric characters assigned to an actuated

alpha-numeric key (78), and wherein repeated actuations of
another said arrow key (78) cause a second sequential display 

in said character position of alpha-numeric characters
assigned to said actuated alpha-numeric key, said second

sequential display being opposite in sense to said first
sequential display.
The telecommunications unit as recited in claim 2,
wherein said one arrow key (78) is an up arrow key and said

another arrow key (78) is a down arrow key.
A method for entry of alpha-numeric characters in a
telecommunication unit that includes an operator panel (50)

with a telephone-style, alpha-numeric keyboard (52), a subset

of keys (58) each having plural-assigned alphabetic
characters in addition to a numeric character assignment, and

up, down, right, left arrow keys (78), an Enter key (64) and
a display panel (54), said arrow keys providing movement

control of a cursor on said display panel, said method
comprising the steps of:


(a) initiating an alpha-numeric entry mode of operation
for said telecommunication unit, said alpha-numeric

mode enabling entry of alphabetic and numeric
characters into character positions in said display

panel (54);
(b) responding to an alpha-numeric key actuation during
said alpha-numeric mode to cause said display panel

(54) to manifest a character assigned to said
actuated key; and
(c) responding to an actuation of a said arrow key (78)
to cause a character position in said display panel 

(54) to manifest other alpha-numeric characters
assigned to said actuated key.
The method as recited in claim 4, wherein in step
(c), repeated actuations of one said arrow key (78) cause a

first sequential display in a display panel character
position of alpha-numeric characters assigned to said

actuated alpha-numeric key, and repeated actuations of
another said arrow key (78) cause a second sequential display

in said character position of alpha-numeric characters
assigned to said actuated alpha-numeric key, said second

sequential display being opposite in sense to said first
sequential display.
The method as recited in claim 5, wherein said one
arrow key (78) is an up arrow key and said another arrow key

(78) is a down arrow key.
