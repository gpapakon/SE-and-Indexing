<ABSTRACT>
With the intention of adapting the vehicle's mission following the occurrence of a disturbing event, the method according to the invention comprises the interpretation of the event in order to determine actions to be undertaken, the breaking down of these actions into options consisting of a sequence of elementary actions executable by specialised expert modules (ME1 to ME6), the selecting of options (51 to 55) on the basis of a strategy, the processing of the option selected by the specialised expert modules (ME1 to ME6) with a view to computing a trajectory with the aid of the elementary actions making up the option selected, and in evaluating the trajectory obtained in relation to at least one criterion and the selecting of at least one trajectory exhibiting the best score. The invention applies in particular to aerodynes, be they piloted or unpiloted.

Method for the real-time reconfiguration of the
path of a vehicle using a computer linked up to

components taken on board said vehicle and which supply
real-time data concerning the position, attitude and

status of the vehicle and its environment, said
computer comprising a processor and memories in which

are notably stored the data concerning the vehicle's
mission and context, and an initial path,

characterized in that, with a view to adapting the
mission to a new situation brought about by the

occurrence of an event causing a disturbance, it
comprises:


the analysis of the context and the interpretation of
said event in order to determine the actions to be

performed;
the breakdown of said actions into alternatives each
comprised of a sequence of elementary actions that can

be performed by at least one of a plurality of
specialised expert modules (ME1 to ME6);
the successive selection of each alternative (51 to
55) as a function of a certain strategy;
the processing of the alternative selected consisting
in using the specialised expert modules (ME1 to ME6)

with a view to devising a path by means of the
elementary actions comprising the alternative

selected, and to assessing the path obtained in
relation to at least one criterion;
the selection of at least one path with the best
assessment and presentation thereof as the solution,

in association with its assessment.
Method according to claim 1,

characterised in that it comprises the writing of each
alternative on a graph (26) formed of knots (50 to 55) 

joined together in a hierarchical manner, and having a
root knot (50) symbolizing the path followed by the

vehicle, each knot symbolizing an alternative.
Method according to any one of the previous
claims,

characterized in that the processing of an alternative
comprises:


the constitution, for each elementary action of the

alternative, of a list of specialised expert modules
(ME1 to ME6) capable of performing that action;
the selection, as a function of the new situation, of
at least one specialised expert module per list with a

view to having each expert module thus selected
cooperate to obtain a complete path;
the successive activation of the expert modules (ME1
to ME6) selected to perform each action of the

alternative;
the formation of a path from the responses supplied
by the activated expert modules; and
the assessment of this path and verification that the
obligations associated with the mission are still

fulfilled.
Method according to claim 3,

characterized in that it comprises the processing of
each unfulfilled obligation, producing three new

alternatives connected, on the alternatives graph,
below the alternative that does not fulfil this

obligation, these three alternatives corresponding
respectively to the following three cases:


the obligation is accepted as "unfulfilled" with, as
consequence, a deterioration of certain assessment

criteria;
the processing of one or more actions of the
alternative is modified, when possible, to tend to 

fulfil the obligation, with, as consequence, a
deterioration of certain assessment criteria; and
palliative measures are applied to attempt to fulfil
the obligation.
Method according to claim 4,

characterized in that the application of palliative
measures comprises:


the seeking out of palliative measures associated
with the unfulfilled obligations and adapted to the

context of the alternative,
the breakdown of each palliative measure into
sequences of elementary actions, each sequence of

elementary actions giving rise to a new alternative,
the updating of the alternatives graph by inscribing
all the alternatives thus identified (53 to 55) below

the alternative having obligations unfulfilled, and
the successive processing of each alternative
identified.
Method according to any one of the previous
claims,

characterized in that the alternatives generated by the
breakdown of the actions into elementary actions (51,

52) are systematically processed, whereas those
generated by the application of palliative measures (53

to 55) are processed successively until one of them
(52) does not have any unfulfilled obligation.
Method according to any one of the previous
claims,

characterized in that the paths are assessed by
determining a risk factor and an efficiency factor,

and, by means of a classification drawn up by an
expert, the best path selected as a solution

corresponding to:

the least risky and most efficient path, 
the more efficient of two paths of equivalent risk,
the less risky of two path of equivalent efficiency,
or
the one preferred by the expert in the event of two
equivalent paths, either because they have equivalent

risk and efficiency factors, or because one is both
more efficient and riskier than the other.
Method according to any one of the previous
claims,

characterized in that it uses four levels of
representation to define a path:


a "mission" level of representation composed of a set
of mission phases described by a descriptive wording,
a "function" level of representation composed of path
portions macroscopically characterized by parameters

such as the data corresponding to a gradient, an
average speed, a length, or positions of the extreme

points of the portion,
a "phase" level of representation characterized by
the definition of a set of phases corresponding to a

particular attitude of the vehicle, and
an "end" level of representation comprised of a
series of points determined by the coordinates,

the means of defining the phases of the "phase" level
of representation, and the type and number of

coordinates of the points in the "end" level of
representation depending on the expert module that

generated them.
Device for implementing the method according to
any one of the previous claims, for the real-time

reconfiguration of the path of a vehicle using a
computer linked up to components taken on board said

vehicle and which supply real-time -data concerning the
position, attitude and status of the vehicle and its 

environment, said computer comprising a processor and
memories in which are notably stored the data

concerning the vehicle's mission and context, and an
initial path,

characterized in that it comprises a man-machine
communications terminal and that, with a view to

adapting the mission to a new situation brought about
by the occurrence of an event causing a disturbance,

the computer is controlled by a programme ensuring:

the functions of a plurality of expert modules (ME1
to ME6) specialised in the elaborating of paths;
a supervisor function which uses the plurality of
specialised expert modules (ME1 to ME6) with a view to

defining a new path in order to adapt the mission to a
new situation brought about by the occurrence of an

event causing a disturbance.
Device according to claim 9,

characterized in that data exchange between the
supervisor function and the specialised expert modules

is managed in accordance with the blackboard principle.
Device according to claim 10,

characterized in that the blackboard is divided into
two parts, a first part figuring the data relating to

the context of the mission, and a second part in which
the different expert modules used constitute a new

path.
Device according to claim 11,

characterized in that the second part of the blackboard
is divided into four levels corresponding to the four

levels of representation of the path.
