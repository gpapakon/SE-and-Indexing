<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzopyran derivatives, processes for
producing the same, the applications thereof as drugs, and pharmaceutical compositions
containing the same. More specifically, it relates to a benzopyran derivative having on its
aromatic ring an acylamino group, and pharmacologically acceptable acid adducts thereof,
processes for production for the same, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same,
and applications of these as drugs against hyperlipidemia.Atherosclerosis is known to be an extremely important factor in various
cardiovascular diseases. Research is actively underway with the aim of suppression of the
progress of artherosclerosis or regression of atherosclerosis. In particular, while drugs for
lowering cholesterol in the serum or arterial wall are recognised as being effective, no ideal
drug has been ralized which has a significant clinical effect and few side effects.On the other hand, it has become apparent that the accumulation of cholesterol
esters in the arterial wall is an important factor in the progress of atherosclerosis.Further, it is known that Acyl-Coenzyme A: Cholesterol Acyltransferase (ACAT)
plays an important role in the formation of cholesterol esters in the tunica mucosa intestini
tenuis or arterial wall.In the past, urea derivatives (reference: J. Med. Chem., vol. 29, p. 1131 (1986),
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-316761, Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-93569, etc.) and amide derivatives (reference: Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-253060 etc.), for example, have been
reported as ACAT enzyme inhibitors.On the other hand, as reports relating to benzopyran derivatives, there are the
specification of U.S. Patent No. 4415741, the published specification of European Patent
Application No. 485984, etc., but there is no specific disclosure on the compounds of the 
present invention among these and it is not known from them that the benzopyran
derivatives have an ACAT inhibitory activity. Further, 6-acylamino-chromanones having
anti-hyperlipidemia activity (reference: Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 60-15626 and Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 60-35346) are
known, but they have a weaker action than the compounds of the present invention and it is
not known that they have an ACAT inhibitory activity. Further, there are known chromans
having urea groups on the aromatic ring (reference: J. Med. Chem., vol. 13, p. 584 (1970)),
