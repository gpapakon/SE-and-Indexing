<ABSTRACT>
The connector comprises a socket in which two side walls (20) delimit two parallel channels, and a plug having projecting fingers orthogonal to an insertion direction. The connector also includes a U-shaped slide drawer for the forced insertion and extraction of the plug. The slide also includes springy retaining tabs (32) which project outwards when not in use and recesses (34), which are elongate in the direction of movement of the slide, are made in the side walls of the socket in order to receive the tabs and have a length such that they allow complete insertion of the slide and prevent it from being completely removed, the springy retaining tabs (32) having a shape such that the force to be exerted in order to pull the slide out of the socket is very much greater than the force necessary to insert it.

An electrical connector comprising : 

a receptacle (10) for receiving first electrical 
contacts, having two side walls (20) that define two 

parallel passages (18) extending in the long direction of 
the receptacle, 
a plug (12) for receiving second contracts 
cooperating with the first contacts, the plug being displaceable 

with respect to the receptacle in an insertion and 
extraction direction, said plug having studs (28a, 28b) 

projecting orthogonally to the insertion and extraction 
direction; and 
a U-shaped slide (14) for forced insertion and 
extraction of the plug, arranged for sliding along the 

passages orthogonally to the insertion direction, formed 
with open-ended stud-receiving grooves (30a, 30b) having a 

shape such that displacement of the slide in the receptacle 
in a first direction causes the studs to move along the 

grooves from the open ends thereof, and displacement in the 
opposite direction forces the studs out of the grooves ; 
 
   characterized in that the slide includes resilient 

retaining lugs (32) that project outwardly when at rest, and 
in that cutouts (34) that are elongate in the slide displacement 

direction are formed in the side walls of the 
receptacle to receive the lugs and are of a length enabling 

to fully insert the slide but preventing full extraction of 
the slide, the resilient retaining lugs (32) being of a 

shape such that the force required for pulling the slide out 
of the receptacle is much greater than the force required 

for inserting it into the receptacle. 
A connector according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the slide (14) is further provided with resilient 

locking tabs (36) apt to be received in notches (38a, 38b) 
formed in the side walls when the slide is in its fully 

inserted position.  
 
A connector according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said notches (38a, 38b) pass through the side walls 

(20) whereby the ends of the tabs can be seen in the notches 
when the slide (14) is fully pushed home, for visual 

inspection. 
A connector according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said studs comprise at least 

one pair of studs (28a) placed in a mid plane of the plug 

(12), the grooves of the slide including at least one pair 
of grooves (30a) designed to receive said studs (28a) and 

said cutouts (34) in the receptacle (10) are symmetrical 
about the mid plane of the receptacle. 
A connector according to claims 2 and 4, characterized 
in that two pairs of notches (38b) for receiving the 

resilient locking tabs (36) are provided and disposed 
symmetrically with respect to the mid plane of the receptacle. 
An electrical connector according to claim 4 or 
5, characterized in that the plug includes two pairs of 

studs (28a, 28b), one of the pairs being situated close to 
one of the plug ends (12), and in that the slide (14) 

includes two pairs of grooves (30a, 30b). 
An electrical connector according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the longitudinal 

size of the cutouts (34) is such that, when the lugs are in 
a rear most abutting position, the openings of the grooves 

(30a, 30b) confront a path of insertion of the studs (28a, 
28b).
