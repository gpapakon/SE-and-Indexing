<ABSTRACT>
The object was to produce chemical composites of this type which combine adequate adhesive properties with good solvent and weathering resistance. 

<
??
>
The process according to the invention proceeds from a rubber composition which contains a mixture comprising 20-100% of EP(D)M rubber and 80-0% of E-SBR, additives, peroxidic vulcanising agents, vulcanisation activators and optionally extenders. The composite is produced by covulcanisation of a PPE-containing thermoplastic moulding composition with the rubber composition. 

<
??
>
The composites obtainable by this process can be used, for example, for the production of brake and clutch discs, profiles, conveyor belts and vehicle tyres.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a bond between a 
thermoplastic, PPE-containing polymer and a rubber by 

thermal treatment in the presence of a vulcanization 
system, characterized in that the starting material is a 

rubber composition comprising 

100 parts by weight of a mixture of from 
20 to 100% of an EP(D)M rubber and 

from 80 to 0% of a styrene-butadiene 
rubber obtained by emulsion 

polymerization, 
from 100 to 300 parts by weight of additives, 
from 1 to 10 parts by weight of peroxidic 
vulcanizing agents, 
from 0.5 to 4 parts by weight of vulcanization 
activators and 
if desired extenders,
 
and the bond is produced by covulcanization of the PPE-containing 

thermoplastic moulding composition with the 
rubber composition. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the rubber composition contains exclusively EPM 

and/or EPDM rubber as rubber constituent. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the thermoplastic moulding composition 

comprises 

a) 100 parts by weight of PPE, 
b) 0 - 20 parts by weight of polyalkenylenes, 
c) 0 - 100 parts by weight of styrene polymers and 
d) if desired further additives. 
A process according to claim 3, characterized in  
 

that the thermoplastic moulding composition contains 5-15 
parts by weight of polyoctenylenes. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the additives used in the rubber 

composition are zinc oxide, carbon black, silicic acid, 
calcium carbonate and/or aluminium silicates. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the rubber composition contains up 

to 150 parts by weight of plasticizer oils. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the covulcanization is carried out 

at temperatures of from 140 to 200°C for from 30 seconds 
to 15 minutes, preferably at from 150 to 180°C for from 

5 to 10 minutes. 
A covulcanizate obtained according to any of 
claims 1 to 7.
