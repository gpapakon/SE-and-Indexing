<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement has a unit with at least one plug for pluggable module (MO1, MO2) that forwards signals to a processing and/or peripheral unit, so that the measuring range of the unit is adapted to the measuring range of the signals. The disclosed arrangement requires only one further module (MO1, MO2) for all measuring ranges, i.e. for all voltage and current ranges. The desired measuring range is set by the position of the module (MO1, MO2) on the plug. The invention has applications in input and output component groups.

<CLAIMS>
Unit which has at least one module location 
having a plug-in module (MO1, MO2) provided with an 

encoding means (CO), which module passes signals to a 
processing unit of an automation device or to a 

peripheral unit connected to the unit, and which can be 
inserted at the module location in different ways for 

the variable measuring range setting of the unit, 
characterised in that the encoding means (CO) indicate 

to the processing unit or the peripheral unit the 
measuring range that is set. 
Unit according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the module (MO1, MO2) is formed as a cube, wherein 

each side surface (a ... f) is provided for a measuring 
range setting.
