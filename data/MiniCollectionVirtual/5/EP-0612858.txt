<ABSTRACT>
A heat transfer element (2) for use in boiling a 
liquid is produced by spraying a substrate, such as a heat 

exchanger tube, with a plasma of liquified metal particles 
and concurrently spraying the substrate with liquid carbon 

dioxide to provide a cooling effect. Preferably the metal 
particle spray (4) and the carbon dioxide spray (8) are 

spaced apart, and there is relative movement between the 
sprays and the substrate, such that a given area of the 

substrate is precooled by the cold carbon dioxide just 
prior to liquified metal particles impinging thereon. A 

shroud (6) may assist in directing the liquid carbon 
dioxide first onto the substrate, then into the spray of 

liquified metal particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a heat transfer element for boiling a
liquid, to the heat transfer element produced in this way,
and to an apparatus for carrying out the process.It is well known that the heat transfer co-efficient
for boiling a liquid may be improved by coating the heat
transfer surface of a heat exchanger with a matrix of
small heat-conductive particles which produce a network of
linked re-entrant cavities. The cavities act as
nucleation centres for the production of bubbles of vapour.So called "high flux" (trademark) tubing having a
high co-efficient of heat transfer is available but its
production is complex and the tubing is correspondingly
expensive. High flux tubing is generally produced by
coating a tube with petroleum jelly and depositing
particles of a cupro-nickel powder onto the tube so that
the particles become embedded in the petroleum jelly. The
cupro-nickel powder is made up of two components having
different melting points. The coated tube is then heated
in a furnace to a temperature such that one of the
components just melts and adheres the other non-melted
powder to the tube. In this way, a matrix of metal
particles firmly adhered to the tube is produced.There have in the past been various attempts to
provide a high heat transfer surface by plasma spraying 
liquified metal onto a substrate, but generally speaking,
results have not been consistent.European Patent application EP-A-303 493 describes a
method of coating heat transfer surfaces by spraying a
particulate mixture of metal and a plastics material onto
a thermally conductive surface to form a coating
comprising particles of plastics material embedded in
metal, and heating to a temperature sufficient to
volatilise the plastics material, thereby forming pores in
the metal coating.Our earlier European Patent application EP-A-485 194
describes the production of a surface coating comprising
porous carbon particles embedded in a matrix of metal
particles produced by plasma spraying a mixture of
particles of metal and carbon onto a substrate in an inert
gas atmosphere.US Patent 3,384,154 describes a method of coating
heat transfer surfaces with small metallic particles which
are subsequently sintered onto the substrate material.US Patent 4,753,849 describes a process of coating an
evaporator tube which involves arc spraying two dissimilar
metals onto the tube and then etching out one of the
metals.European Patent application EP-A-17944 describes the
production of a porous boiling
