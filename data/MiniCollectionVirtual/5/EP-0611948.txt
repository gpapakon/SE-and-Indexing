<DESCRIPTION>
Systems are known for measuring those characteristic attitude 
angles of the wheels of an automobile frame which enable 
convergence to be determined and the thrust axis defined. These known systems use devices comprising, inter alia, light beam 
emitting means in combination with angle transducer means of 
optical type which are fixed to the wheel rims by suitable 
brackets and interact with the transducers of the adjacent wheels, 
both on the same side and on the opposing sides of the automobile 
frame, by feeding and receiving light beams parallel to the 
equatorial planes of the wheels and measuring the angles of 
incidence of said beams. There is however one attitude quantity, depending on its 
geometrical characteristics, which it is not possible to measure 
by known systems. This quantity is the wheel base which because of the inclination 
of the steering axis varies as the steering angle varies. It should be noted that the term "steering axis" means the axis 
about which the overall wheel swivels when steered. The steering axis is generally inclined both in the transverse 
plane perpendicular to the automobile frame axis and in the 
longitudinal plane parallel to said axis.  
 The inclination is such that the steering axis is generally 
incident with the surface on which the frame rests at a point 
external to the equatorial wheel plane, and in front of the point 
of contact of the diametrical plane with the resting surface in 
the direction of movement. The so-called transverse and longitudinal wheel offsets are 
determined by projecting the distance of the point of incidence 
from the point of contact into the transverse and longitudinal 
planes passing through the centre of the wheel equatorial plane 
(wheel centre of rotation). In accordance with well known parameters the values of the wheel 
offsets determine the directional stability of the automobile 
frame during both straight and curved movement. As these offsets vary in accordance with the wheel steering angle, 
as does the wheel base, the corresponding offset variations can be 
obtained by measuring the wheel base variations as a function of 
the steering angle. This indicates the importance of being able to measure the wheel 
base. This is precisely the object of the invention, which is attained 
by positioning, in known optical measurement devices, two light 
emitting diodes (LEDs) at a predetermined distance apart in 
proximity to the same horizontal plane. Using elementary trigonometrical calculations, the wheel base can 
be
