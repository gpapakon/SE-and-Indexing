<ABSTRACT>
The image sensor comprises an analog memory array integrated on a die with a
CMOS sensor array and coupled to the sensor array for receiving light intensity signals

from the sensor array. The sensor array may comprise light sensitive pixels arranged in
rows and columns equal in number or greater than the number of memory cells in the

memory array which are also arranged in rows and columns. The memory cells may be
grouped into one or more distinct memory arrays. The image sensor operates in a rolling

shutter mode which closely approximates electronic frame capture since the transfer
process can be made sufficiently fast. This CMOS image sensor is particularly

advantageous since it can be produced without requiring a special manufacturing process
and still maintains a high performance level. Certain features of the image sensor along

with the optical isolation of the memory array result in longer hold times in the memory
cells by reducing the effects of light piping, optically enhanced sub-threshold current, and

photo charge in the substrate. Structural variations in the sensor and the memory arrays
may be compensated by double sampling the data from the sensor array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to image sensors, and more particularly to
integrated CMOS image sensors.Current image sensors utilize two differing technologies. Charge coupled device
(CCD) image sensors are the more established technology. However, CMOS image
sensors have become more popular in the industry over the last few years. Both
technologies create an electrical signal representative of the light impinging on the
sensor. Until recently, CCD's produced higher quality images than CMOS sensors. The
image quality produced by CMOS sensors has improved dramatically in recent years,
which when coupled with the fact that these sensors can be manufactured using standard
CMOS processes explains their increase in popularity.CCD sensors are designed by coupling photo detectors such as photodiodes to a
charge coupled device that is used to both store and transfer the charge generated by the
photo detectors. The charge coupled device is comprised of a series of overlapping gates
that are sequentially connected to different phases of a clock signal. In most CCD
sensors there are either three or four clock phases. Charge can be stored under a
particular gate by providing that gate with a high voltage and the adjacent gates with a
low voltage. Charge is transferred between adjacent gates by holding both gates at a high
voltage and then driving the gate that initially held the charge to a low voltage.As illustrated in figure 1, a common CCD sensor architecture 10 employs
multiple columns of photo detectors 11. Each column is coupled to a vertical charge 
coupled devicel2 through a transfer gate 13. During readout, charge is transferred from
the photo detectors 11 into the vertical charge coupled devices 12. The vertical charge
coupled devices 12 transfer this charge into a horizontal charge coupled device 14, one
row at a time. The output of the horizontal charge coupled device 14 is connected to an
amplifier 15 that converts the charge into a voltage that can be transferred off chip.Figure 2A illustrates a CMOS sensor 20 which utilizes sensor elements known as
active photosensitive (APS) pixels 21 laid out in rows and columns. Pixels 21 are
connected to column amplifiers 22 through data lines 23. The amplified output signals
are stored in a buffer 24. A common APS pixel 21 is a 3T (three-transistor) pixel as
shown in figure 2B. The 3T pixel 21 comprises a reset transistor 26 that is controlled by
a reset clock signal RR and is coupled to a photodiode 26, a second transistor 27 that is
configured as a source
