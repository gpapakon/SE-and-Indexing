<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates a process for uniformly mixing 
heterogeneous or multiphase systems comprising a continuous phase 

and at least a solid, dispersed phase in a pulsatile flow reactor 
(PUFR) as herein defined wherein the uniform mixing is carried out 

by actuating means for pulsing the continuous phase. The PUFR can 
be used in its horizontal or vertical orientation. The PUFR is 

useful for example to carry out the catalytic polymerization of 
olefins in a heterogeneous phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of uniformly mixing 
heterogeneous and multiphase systems which have a continuous phase 
and a dispersed phase such as liquid/solid, solid/gas or 
solid/liquid/gas systems. It is well known in the art to use methods of mixing which use 
stirred reactors whether they be in the form of motorised paddles or 
other moving parts in a reactor. However, such methods suffer from 
the disadvantage that they are not particularly suited to the mixing 
of eg solid/gas or liquid/gas systems. Moreover, these involve 
moving parts which not only runs the risk of mechanical failure but 
also inefficient mixing. One method of overcoming the problems of 
such mechanical mixing systems is to use turbulent flow reactors 
which involve a high throughput in order to achieve near plug flow 
and this may cause either non-uniform mixing or inadequate reaction 
where the contents of the reactor being mixed are expected to 
interact chemically. A further method which has been used recently is a pulsatile 
flow reactor (hereafter "PUFR") as described in our published 
copending EP-A-0 540 180 for the production of polyolefins. This 
publication does not disclose mixing and/or reaction of 
heterogeneous systems, especially if a reaction is desired between a 
solid/liquid, gas/solid or a gas/slurry system of the type 
encountered in the production eg of polyethylene. It has now been found that the problems of prior processes can 
be mitigated by the use of a PUFR in which heterogeneous reactions  
 
can be carried out and in which the mean flow is less than the 
minimum fluidization velocity when the reactor is used in a vertical 
mode. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for uniformly 
mixing heterogeneous or multiphase systems comprising a continuous 
phase and at least a solid, dispersed phase in a PUFR wherein the 
uniform mixing is carried out by actuating means for pulsing the 
continuous phase. The process of the present invention is particularly suitable 
for uniformly mixing heterogeneous or multiphase systems in a PUFR 
when used in a vertical mode. In this mode, the uniform mixing is 
suitably carried out by actuating means for pulsing the continuous 
phase in the PUFR such that the mean flow of the system is less than 
the minimum fluidization velocity thereof. By "minimum fluidization velocity" is meant here and 
throughout the specification the minimum upward velocity of the 
continuous phase required to enable fluidization of the particles in 
said continuous phase, ie
