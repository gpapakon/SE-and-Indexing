<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an emptying device for a roller cooling bed for cooling and aligning rollable rolling stock, in particular pipes (tubes), in approximately wedge-shaped pockets which are formed between the meshing outer roller surfaces of a multiplicity of mutually parallel driven rollers and out of which the rolling stock can be transferred into adjacent pockets. In order, with a low degree of structural outlay, to permit emptying of the roller cooling bed in a functionally reliable manner as well as to form spacings between the rolling-stock batches transported on the cooling bed, it is proposed that, in order to empty the pockets (5), the capacity thereof can be reduced by at least two slides (9) which are distributed over the cooling-bed width, can be introduced into the pockets and can be displaced, transversely with respect to the rolling stock (6), over the length of the cooling bed.

<CLAIMS>
An emptying device for a roller cooling bed (R) 
for cooling and straightening rollable rolled stock 

(6), in particular pipes, in approximately wedge-shaped 
pockets (5) formed between the meshing roller shells of 

a plurality of rollers (1) arranged parallel next to 
each other, from which pockets the rolled stock (6) can 

be transferred into neighbouring pockets (5) by means 
of pushers (9) distributed transversely to the rolled 

stock (6) across the width of the cooling bed and 
movable across the length of the cooling bed, which 

pushers reduce the receiving volume of the pockets (5),
 
characterised in that
 
at least two pushers (9) form part of at least one car 

(7) which rolls with its wheels (8) in the direction of 
transportation (T) of the rolled stock (6) on the 

roller shells (4) of the cooling rollers (1), the 
wheelbase (l) of which corresponds to the axle base (L) 

of two cooling rollers (1) which adjoin each other in 
the direction of transportation and the front end of 

which forms the pushers. 
An emptying device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that it has a drive device for the car 

(7) which is designed as a movable bridge spanning the 
roller cooling bed. 
An emptying device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that it has a drive device for the car 

(7) which is designed as a chain or an endless cable 
(20) connected to the car (7).
