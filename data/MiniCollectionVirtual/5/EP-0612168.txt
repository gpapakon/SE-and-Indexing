<ABSTRACT>
Data communication apparatus uses a storage device effectively and 
supplying data to as many user terminals as possible. Sub-control units 

24₁ - 24

 reads unit data in which dynamic image data having continuity 
is divided and compressed from storage devices 26₁ - 26
K
 sequentially 
according to the tokens stored in queues of a system control unit 14, and 

supplies buffers 20₁ - 20
M
 corresponding to storage devices 26₁ - 26
K
 
through a change-over switch 22 for connection corresponding to the 

tokens. The unit data stored in the buffers is supplied to terminals 12₁ 
- 12
M
 as analog data of dynamic image through expanders 18₁ - 18

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data communication apparatus for 
transmitting digital image data such as dynamic images (animation) or 
continuous images by a computer or the like. There have been conventionally used user terminal devices which 
display on a monitor or the like an image according to digital image data 
supplied from an image data communication apparatus such as a computer. 
The image includes static images continusous in time. The images are 
continuously displayed so that the dynamic image of a work (movies or 
animation) can be displayed. In the above mentioned data communication apparatus, the digital 
data (unit data) of a plurality of static images which are components of 
dynamic images are stored in a storage device in advance. In accordance 
with requests from a number of user terminals, the unit data which is 
requested for display is sequentially read from the storage device, and 
supplied to the user terminals. Thus, the dynamic image is displayed on 
the user terminals. Since the amount of data of the dynamic image of a 
digitized work is generally enormous, the digital data of the dynamic 
image has been frequently compressed in order to reduce the capacity of 
the digital data by employing a data compression technique, and then 
stored in a storage device (for example, a hard disk device). Furthermore, in this data communication apparatus, the continuous 
digital image data is supplied to the plurality of user terminals without 
being interrupted from one storage device by utilizing a difference 
between the speed of reading the unit data from the storage device (hard 
disk device) and the speed of transmitting the unit data to the user 
terminals. That is, assuming that the speed of reading the unit data 
from the storage device is T bits/second (a value obtained by dividing 
the size of data to be read by the sum of the maximum seek time, the 
maximum rotation waiting time, and the data transfer time, for example, 
30 M bits/second), this data reading speed T is faster than a speed D 
bits/second (for example, 1.5 M bits/second) required for processing the 
unit data in the user terminal. Thus, while the unit data is being 
processed in one user terminal, the data supply to this user terminal is 
completed. Therefore, the number N of the user terminals which  
 
simultaneously process the same work can be determined in accordance with 
the following equation (1).

x. In a conventional image
