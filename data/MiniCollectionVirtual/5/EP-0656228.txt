<ABSTRACT>
A method for the uniform loading of catalyst tubes 
with catalyst particles, which tubes are mounted at tube 

inlet side in a tube sheet, the method comprises introducing 
a feedstream of catalyst particles on the tubesheet 

in a number of substreams with a substantial equal particle 
flow and velocity by dividing the feedstream and each 

resulting substream into at least two streams in two or 
more dividing steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the loading of
catalyst particles. In particular, the invention provides a
method and an apparatus for the uniform loading of catalyst
particles in a reactor having a plurality of catalyst
tubes.In conventional procedures for the catalyst loading
of the above type of tubular reactors, the catalyst particles
become poured in large amounts on the top tube sheet
in the reactors, and the particles are allowed to flow into
the catalyst tubes. By this method, the loading time of the
tubes is very short, and the loading density of catalyst
particles are low.Further a drawback of the conventional loading
procedures is a non-uniform distribution of catalyst particles
in different tubes of the reactor. By simply pouring
large amounts of catalyst particles on the tube sheet,
local bridging or plugging of the tube inlet leads to large
variations in loading weight and density of the tubes. As a
result, variations in pressure drop and flow of process gas
through the reactor caused by different loading density and
weight is detrimental for the overall efficiency of the
catalytic process.It has been observed that conveyance of catalyst
particles to the inlet of a plurality of tubes under controlled
conditions of particle flow and loading time provides
a more uniform loading profile of catalyst tubes.Based on the above observation, this invention
provides a method for the uniform loading of catalyst tubes
with catalyst particles, which tubes are mounted at tube
inlet side in a tube sheet, the method comprises introducing
a feedstream of catalyst particles on the tubesheet
in a number of substreams with a substantial equal particle
flow and velocity by dividing the feedstream and each
resulting substream into at least two streams in two or
more dividing steps. The number of dividing steps controls, thereby, the
rate of particle conveyance to the tubesheet and into catalyst
tubes. By proper adjustment of the number and size of
substreams, it is possible to obtain an appropriate
loading time and density leading to a substantial uniform
density and weight of catalyst particles in the catalyst
tubes.The actual adjustment of the above parameters will,
however, further depend on desired process parameters
including necessary space velocity and acceptable pressure
drop of a process gas being reacted in the catalyst tubes.The invention, furthermore, provides an apparatus
being useful in carrying out the above improved loading
method. In its broadest embodiment, the apparatus comprises
a stack

A method for the uniform loading of catalyst tubes

inlet side in a tube sheet, the method comprises introducing
a feedstream of catalyst particles on the tubesheet

in a number of substreams with a substantial equal particle
flow and velocity by dividing the feedstream and each

resulting substream into at least two streams in two or
more dividing steps.
Apparatus for the uniform loading of catalyst
tubes, comprising a stack of horizontal plates being spaced

from each other, each plate is provided with a number of
apertures of equal size and at a distance and pitch, so

that a vertical projection of the apertures to adjacent
plates is not concentric with the apertures on the plates

and the number of apertures in the succeeding plate is
increased by at least one aperture, whereby an incoming

stream of catalyst particles is divided into an increasing
number of substreams by passage through the apertures.
