<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of applying a decorative 
finish to a raised and fielded panel. In the method a 

panel and a sheet of decorative material are brought 
together so that the sheet overlies the raised and fielded 

side of the panel and at least one of the raised and 
fielded side of the panel or the obverse face of the sheet 

of decorative material has a coating of a suitable 
composition. Such a composition comprises a heat 

activatable adhesive, with the adhesive properties of the 
composition being activatable at or above about 80
o
C. The 
sheet of decorative material is then pressed against the 

panel at a temperature of from about 90
o
 to about 170
o
C and 
at a pressure of from about 1 to about 6 bars for from 

about 5 to about 25 seconds. In that manner there is 
formed a decorative surface on the raised and fielded side 

of the panel in which the adhered sheet follows the 
contours of the panel. The advantage of the method is that 

it can avoid wrinkling of the sheet of decorative material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the decoration of panels 
and, in particular, to a method of applying a decorative 
finish to a raised and fielded door or like panel. In order to conserve forests it is becoming increasingly 
undesirable to produce solid wood products. For example, 
solid wood mahogany products are becoming unfashionable 
with all true conservationists because of the effect on 
tropical rain forests caused by deforestation to supply 
mahogany wood. Moreover, equally good products can be 
produced from wood waste formed into, for example, medium 
density fibreboard by laminating to the outside surface 
thereof a decorative finish applied as a sheet of material 
such as paper, plastics or a paper/plastics laminate. Thus, it is known to apply a decorative finish to door or 
like panels using various kinds of sheet material and a 
heat activatable coating on the panel. The panel and sheet 
material typically are pressed together at a temperature at 
which the coating is activated and the thus-formed laminate 
then cooled to provide a decorated panel. While the above technique is generally satisfactory 
difficulties can arise (a) with the use of paper sheet 
material and/or (b) where the panel is a raised and fielded  
 
panel with fielding varying in at least two directions at 
each corner of the panel. In such circumstances wrinkling 
can occur, especially at each corner and the decorative 
finish can be spoiled. Within the above context we have now found surprisingly 
that wrinkling of the sheet material especially at each 
corner can be avoided by a careful selection of the 
operating conditions, generally time, temperature and 
pressure. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of 
applying a decorative finish to a raised and fielded door 
or like panel, which method comprises bringing together the 
panel and a sheet of decorative material so that the sheet 
overlies the raised and fielded side of the panel, at least 
one of the raised and fielded side of the panel or the 
obverse face of the sheet of decorative material having a 
coating of a composition comprising a heat activatable 
adhesive, the adhesive properties of the composition being 
activatable at or above about 80oC, and pressing the sheet 
of decorative material against the door panel at a 
temperature of from about 90o to about 170oC and at a 
pressure of from about 1 to about 6 bars for from about 5 
to about 25 seconds, so as to form a decorative surface on 
the raised and fielded side of the panel in which

A method of applying a decorative finish to a raised 
and fielded panel, which method comprises bringing together 

the panel and a sheet of decorative material so that the 
sheet overlies the raised and fielded side of the panel, 

at least one of the raised and fielded side of the panel 
or the obverse face of the sheet of decorative material 

having a coating of a composition comprising a heat 
activatable adhesive, the adhesive properties of the 

composition being activatable at or above about 80oC, and 
pressing the sheet of decorative material against the panel 

at a temperature of from about 90o to about 170oC and at a 
pressure of from about 1 to about 6 bars for from about 5 

to about 25 seconds, so as to form a decorative surface on 
the raised and fielded side of the panel in which the 

adhered sheet follows the contours of the panel. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the panel is 
framed by a framing element at each side edge and the 

abutting ends of the elements are mitred. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
panel comprises a medium density fibreboard. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the 
framing elem
ents comprise a laminated profile, preferably 
a chipboard or medium density fibreboard laminated profile. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the composition comprises a polyvinylacetate cross-linking 

adhesive. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the composition comprises a polyurethane. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the composition is applied to the panel face, for 

example, by spraying. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the decorative material comprises paper, preferably 

a paper sheet or a laminate of paper and substrate, for 
example, a fleece backing. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the panel fielding varies in at least two 

directions at each corner of the panel. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the door panel and sheet of decorative material are 

brought together in a membrane press.
