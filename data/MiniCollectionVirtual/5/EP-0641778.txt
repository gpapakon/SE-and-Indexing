<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing ε-caprolactam (hereinafter referred to as 
"lactam") and more particularly, to a process for 
producing high quality lactam by contacting crude lactam 
obtained by gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone 
oxime (hereinafter referred to as "oxime") with 
hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. High quality lactam is used as raw material for 
polyamide fibers and polyamide resins. It is well known 
that the lactam can be produced in the following manner. 
That is, oxime is rearranged in a sulfuric acid medium, 
then neutralized with aqueous ammonia and extracted with 
an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, 
followed by removing the solvent by distillation and then 
subjecting the residue to rectification ("Kogyo Yuki 
Kagaku (Industrial Organic Chemistry)", page 244 published 
from Tokyo Kagaku Dojin in 1989). However, in the case of oxime being rearranged 
in gas phase using a solid acid in place of sulfuric acid 
as a catalyst, when the resulting crude lactam is 
dissolved in water and the solution is mixed with an 
aromatic solvent such as benzene, lactam cannot be 
extracted into the aromatic solvent layer possibly 
because the aqueous solution does not contain inorganic 
materials and the above process which is effective in the 
case of oxime being rearranged in a sulfuric acid medium 
cannot be applied to the production of lactam when a 
solid acid catalyst is used. When oxime is rearranged in gas phase using a 
solid acid catalyst and when the resulting crude lactam 
is subjected to rectification, lactam of satisfactory  
 
quality cannot be obtained possibly because by-products 
differ from those in the case of oxime being rearranged 
in the sulfuric acid medium. Another effective process for producing high 
quality lactam comprises treating a crude lactam obtained 
by Beckmann rearrangement in fuming sulfuric acid with 
hydrogen at 50-80°C using a palladium or nickel supported 
catalyst. According to this process, when the hydrogen 
treatment temperature is 130°C, not only sufficient 
purification effect cannot be obtained, but also the 
quality of the lactam is poor (USP 5,032,684). However, even when crude lactam obtained by gas 
phase Beckmann rearrangement is subjected to hydrogen 
treatment at 50-80°C, no lactam of satisfactory quality 
can be obtained possibly because the by-products differ 
from those in the case of employing liquid phase 
rearrangement. The inventors have conducted intensive
