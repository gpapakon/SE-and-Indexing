<ABSTRACT>
A connector (10) for an edge card (100) which 
includes a plurality of contact terminals spaced apart in 

an elongated connector housing (12) has at least one 
latch/eject mechanism (202, 260, 280) rotatably disposed at 

an end (18, 19) of the connector housing. The latch/eject 
member operates between a first operative position wherein 

it latches the edge card in place within the connector 
housing and a second operative position wherein it at least 

partially ejects the edge card out of the connector 
housing. The latch/eject member is limited in its rotation 

during ejection of the edge card by one or more 
interference surfaces (224, 226) formed in the latch/eject 

member which engage a portion of the connector housing (34, 
34') during ejection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an edge card
connector according to the preamble of claim 1.Circuit, or edge card, connectors have been
developed for computers to provide for a connection between
a main computer printed circuit board, commonly referred to
in the art as a "mother board" board and secondary
electronic circuits contained on smaller printed commonly
referred to as "daughter" boards. These secondary circuits
may be added to computers or similar electronic devices
after the initial manufacture thereof to improve the
performance thereof. They may be added by either a
professional computer technician or a relatively unskilled
computer user.Space on the mother board on computers, as in
most electronic devices, is at a premium. consumers prefer
more compact style of electronic devise and hence, the
closer that assembly components, such as daughter board,
may be spaced together on the mother board, the more
compact the overall device may become.There are a number of different known designs for
connectors which are intended for permanent installation on
the mother board. The connectors receive a daughter board
and provide a connection between the circuitry on both of
the mother board an the daughter boards. Daughter boards
are often descriptively referred to in the art as "edge 
cards" because, one edge of the card contains a plurality
of contacts which extend laterally along the edge. The
edge containing these contacts is inserted into a slot of
a connector. The connector slot includes a plurality
contacts arranged in opposition to the edge card contacts
portions. The connector contacts often extend downwardly
from the connector slot through the connector body and
typically terminate in tail portions which are aligned with
a series of openings or penetrations on the mother board.
the tails project into these openings and are soldered
thereto to form an electrically conductive connection
between the mother board and the edge card connector. It
is also known to mount the tails to the surface of the
board.Edge card connectors are well known in the art.
Some of these connectors include mechanisms which latch, or
secure, the edge card in place within the connector after
insertion thereof, others include mechanisms which permit
the user to eject the edge card from the connector slot
after insertion and still other include mechanisms which
include mechanisms which perform both of the latch and
eject functions. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,990,097,
issued February 5, 1991, describes an edge
