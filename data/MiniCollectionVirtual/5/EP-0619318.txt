<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for synthetizing 
alkylpolyglucosides is disclosed, which consists in 

reacting a glycoside with a long-chain alcohol in the 
presence of a novel type of catalyst, constituted by 

an alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid, wherein the sulfonic 
group is sterically hindered. By means of the use of 

these catalysts, a reaction raw product is obtained 
which is practically free from byproducts. 
The resulting alkylpolyglucosides are completely 
recyclable surfactants, useful in detergency field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
process for synthetizing alkylpolyglucosides. In particular, the present invention relates to 
a process for synthetizing alkylpolyglucosides by 
using a novel catalyst, which is a sterically hindered 
sulfonic acid, which allows a better selectivity to 
the product, and therefore, a reaction raw product 
which is practically free from undesired byproducts, 
to be obtained. Alkylpolyglucosides are a class of substances 
constituted by a chain of ring structures from a sugar 
linked to each other by glucosidic linkages; the last 
ring of the glucosidic chain is acetalized with an 
alcohol. The general structure of alkylpolyglucosides 
is represented by the formula: 
H-(G)n-O-R 
wherein G represents a glucosidic unit, R is the 
corresponding residue to the alcohol used in order to 
form the glucosidic acetal and n is the polymerization 
degree, i.e., the number of mutually linked glucosidic 
units. Particularly important from an industrial 
viewpoint are those alkylpolyglucosides in which n is 
comprised within the range of from 1 to 5, and R is 
the residue of an aliphatic, (either straight or 
branched) long-chain alcohol. In fact, these types of 
alkylpolyglucosides are non-ionic surfactants which 
may find uses in the normal sectors of use of 
surfactants, and, in particular, in the detergency  
 
field. In the following, with the characters "APG", 
these particular alkylglucosidic oligomers are 
referred to, in short form. The value of n can be 
controlled by varying the molar ratio of alcohol to 
saccharide in the APG preparation reaction: in fact, 
when this ratio is increased, APG's with a lower 
average value of n are obtained. According to an 
alternative procedure, the separation can be carried 
out of produced APG's at the end of the production 
cycle, as disclosed in detail in following. Alkylpolyglucosides offer, as compared to 
traditional surfactants, two important advantages: 
first of all, they can be obtained from renewable 
natural sources, essentially constituted by starch and 
coconut oil; secondly, alkylpolyglucosides are 100% 
biodegradable; consequently, the industrial interest 
in these compounds is high and has increased during 
the past years. The preparation of APG's has been studied for 
long years, and several synthesis routes are 
available, starting from different reactant 
combinations. A first possibility is the direct synthesis by 
starting from the sugar and the alcohol (or alcohols 
mixture) which constitute the end
