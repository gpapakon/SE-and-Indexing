<ABSTRACT>
A book packaging container, comprising 
four walls (10), a floor (9) and 

cover flaps (11) which can be folded 
into a container closing cover after 

wrapping the books, said walls, floor 
and cover defining a space having a 

certain size and shape. The floor (9) 
of a container or a separate base 

sheet (3) laid upon the floor of a 
container is fitted with carton or 

cardboard flaps (5) whose bases are 
located adjacent to an edge (13) between 

the opposite end walls (10) and 
the floor (9) of a container. The 

flaps (5) have a length which only 
slightly less than that of the container, 

whereby the ends of said flaps 
(5) can be fastened in an overlapping 

(7) fashion against each other on top 
of a bundle of books (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a book packaging container, 
comprising four walls, a floor and cover flaps which can be 
folded into a container closing cover after wrapping the 
books, said walls, floor and cover defining a space having 
a certain size and shape (see for example US-A-2 005 967). Book clubs, for example, mail books to their subscribers in 
such book packaging containers or parcels. The size of books 
to be mailed and the thickness of book bundles vary and, 
thus, more or less empty space is left between a bundle of 
books and the walls of a container. However, it is necessary 
to eliminate the movement of books inside the container as 
effectively as possible for preventing damage to the books 
as a result of rubbing against each other and colliding 
against the walls of a container. Hence, it is prior known 
to furnish a container with various paddings. Those are 
nevertheless inconvenient and often also littering. Prior 
known is also a plastic bag which expands through the action 
of chemicals (instafoam). The use of such a bag is also 
inconvenient and disposal of the bag creates an environmental 
problem. In addition, threading of a plastic wrapper 
strip between the floor flaps is also prior known for 
binding a pile of books with the wrapper strip into an 
integral bundle against the floor. However, the further 
handling of a package is inconvenient since the plastic must 
be separated therefrom before the cardboard material can be 
recycled or incinerated. Another drawback is that the 
wrapper strip must be added already in the container making 
machine. Yet, most of the containers are manufactured by 
using machines which lack this possibility and, hence, those 
who use the containers have to settle with the above-mentioned 
paddings. An object of the invention is to provide an improved book 
packaging container, wherein the elimination or restriction  
 
of movements for a bundle of books of varying dimensions can 
be effected without the above drawbacks. This object is achieved by means of the invention in such a 
manner that the floor of said container or a separate base 
sheet laid upon the floor of said container is fitted with 
carton or cardboard flaps whose bases are located adjacent 
to an edge between the opposite end walls and the floor of 
said container, said flaps having a length which is more than 
the sum of the half-height and the half-length of said container 
but less than the length of said container, whereby the ends 
of the flaps can be fastened in an

container, each of said flaps (5) having a length which is more than 

the sum of the half-height and the half-length of said container 
but less than the length of said container, whereby the ends 

of the flaps (5) can be fastened in an overlapping (7) 
fashion against each other on top of a bundle of books (6). 
A book packaging container as set forth in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the separate base sheet 
(3) made of carton or cardboard is of a size that matches 

the floor of said container (1), such that the base sheet (3) 
abuts with its edges against the walls (10) surrounding the 

floor of said container, and that the bases of said flaps (5) 
join the base sheet (3) at a small distance from the ends of 

the base sheet (3). 
A book packaging container as set forth in claim 2, 

characterized
 in that said flaps (5) consist of 
the same continuous web of carton or cardboard as said base 

sheet (3) and that said small distance is provided by 
double-folding the web into end or flank reinforcements (4) 

for the base sheet, the superimposed plies being glued 
together at said reinforcements. 
A book packaging container as set forth in claim 2 or 3, 

characterized
 in that said base sheet (3) is  
 

glued securely to the floor (9) of said container (1). 
A book packaging container as set forth in any of claims 
1-4, 
characterized
 in that inside the container 
(1) made of a corrugated cardboard is fitted a wrapper unit 

(2), which consists of said base sheet (3) and said flaps 
(5). 
A book packaging container as set forth in any of claims 
2-4, 
characterized
 in that said separate base 
sheet (3') and said flaps (5) are made of a single corrugated 

cardboard having its smooth face fastened to the inner 
surface of the container floor (9). 
A book packaging container as set forth in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that said flaps (5) are made of 
the same continuous cardboard material as the container (1) 

and formed from the extensions of closing flaps for the 
floor (9). 
A book packaging container as set forth in any of claims 
1-7, 
characterized
 in that the flaps are 
different in length. 
A book packaging container as set forth in claim 8, 

characterized
 in that the outer face adjacent to 
the end flank of the shorter flap (5) is provided with an
