<DESCRIPTION>
 VAGINAL CERVICAL RETRACTOR ELEVATORBackground of the InventionVarious medical examinations and procedures which are performed on women require that the women's uterus be manipulated such that the uterus and cervix can be properly viewed by the physician. Typical of these examinations and procedures would be a complete total laparoscopic hysterectomy, a partial laparoscopic hysterectomy, a colpotomy, as well as other procedures and examinations. Generally, during the performance of a laparoscopic procedure, a small incision is made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope is inserted therethrough to permit visualization of the peritoneal cavity and the uterus.A number of instruments have been developed to assist the physician in visualizing the uterus and facilitating the performance of these various examinations and procedures. Typical of these prior art instruments are those which are described in U.S. Patents 3,926,192 issued to Van Maren; 4,000,743 issued to Weaver; 4,976,717 issued to Boyle; and 4,997,419 issued to Lakatos et al. The patent to Van Maren is directed to a medical instrument which is inserted into the vagina and passes through the cervix to enter the uterus. A cup- shaped member is provided whose end wall is connected to a source of vacuum, the cup-shaped member including a conical element designed to be placed against the cervical os. The patent to Weaver describes a uterine anteverter which includes an arcuately curved shield which limits the distance a manipulating arm can be extended into the uterine cavity.However, none of these prior art medical instruments adequately and completely perform its function so as to reduce the time of the surgical procedure, would minimize blood loss during surgery and would minimize the risk of infection and injury to the patient during surgery.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention alleviates the problems of the prior art devices by providing a device which can perform a complete, total laparoscopic hysterectomy and other procedures 

such as a colpotomy while maintaining pneumoperitoneu , thereby preventing abdominal deflation once the vagina is entered during laparoscopic surgery, by utilizing a vaginal cervical retractor elevator provided with an inner plastic tubing, inner and outer caps designed to move on the inner tubing and a hollow, plastic outer shaft into which the inner tubing can be inserted. The outer cap is provided with a funnel-like base and both caps include a hole therein allowing a uterine manipulator to be inserted

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A device for the manipulation of the uterus comprising: an elongated inner tube having a distal end and a proximal end; an outer cervical cap having a top portion of a first diameter and a bottom portion having a second diameter less than said first diameter, said bottom portion of said outer cap provided with a hole therein; an inner cervical cap having a top portion of a third diameter and a bottom portion having a fourth diameter less than said third diameter, said bottom portion of said inner cap provided with a hole therein, said inner cap joined to, and provided within said outer cap to form a retractor elevator, said elevator movable on said elongated inner tube; and an outer hollow shaft having a distal end and a proximal end, provided with a longitudinal groove having a distal end and a proximal end extending from the distal end of said outer shaft to immediately prior to the proximal end of said shaft, said elongated inner tube inserted into said outer shaft during uterine manipulation; wherein when said device is utilized, said inner cap would surround and support the cervix and said outer cap would stretch the upper vaginal canal.
2. The device in accordance with claim 1, wherein said longitudinal groove terminates at its proximal end with an elongated beaded aperture, the proximal end of said outer hollow shaft provided with a hole enabling said inner tube to move through said beaded aperture and said hole of said outer hollow shaft.
3. The device in accordance with claim 1, further including a disk provided with a hole therein, said disk attached to said bottom portion of said outer cap. 


 4. The device in accordance with claim 3, wherein said disk is provided with an inner disk made from a firm plastic material and an outer disk, surrounding said inner disk, made from a softer, more flexible plastic material.
5. The device in accordance with claim 1, wherein a cervical stop is permanently affixed to said elongated inner tube close to its proximal end.
6. The device in accordance with claim 3, wherein a cervical stop is permanently affixed to said elongated inner tube close to its proximal end.
7. The device in accordance with claim 1, wherein the proximal end of said inner tube is provided with a first balloon and the distal end of said inner tube is provided with a second balloon.
8. The device in accordance with claim 5, wherein the proximal end of said inner tube is provided with a first balloon and the distal end of said inner tube is provided with a second balloon.
9. The device in accordance with claim 6, wherein the proximal end of said inner tube is provided with a first balloon and the distal end of said inner tube is provided with a second balloon.
