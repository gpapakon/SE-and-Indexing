<ABSTRACT>
By way of summary, the present invention relates to waterborne coating compositions, methods of preparing such compositions, and methods of applying such compositions. More particularly, but without limitation, two compositions of the present invention comprise water-containing dispersions, suspensions or emulsions employing either (a) about 10 % to about 90 %, by weight of the final compositions, of a select urethane-urea dispersion; having incorporated therein either (b) about 10 % to about 90 %, by weight of the final composition, of a bituminous material, such as asphalt or (c) about 10 % to about 90 %, by weight of the final composition, of a (vinylic) latex material. An additional water-containing dispersion, suspension or emulsion is disclosed without limitation, as employing (a) about 5 % to about 10 % by weight of the final composition of a urethane-urea dispersion; (b) about 5 % to about 30 % by weight of the final composition of a (vinylic) latex material; and (c) about 10 % to about 90 %, by weight of the final composition, of a bituminous material, preferably asphalt.

<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYURETHANE-CONTAINING SEALANT AND COATINGThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial Number 684,231, filed April 12, 1991 and which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.This application is related to compositions and methods providing improved sealing and coating properties. Such compositions and methods are particularly useful in sealing and/or coating aging, chalky, rough or powdery surfaces which are typically difficult to seal or coat and maintain good adhesion, such as roofs or driveways. They are also particularly useful in coating flexible surfaces (or surfaces undergo thermal expansion/contraction) and require the associated coating to flex without significant loss of its sealing properties.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The compositions and methods of the present invention relate to waterborne sealing or coating compositions which employ urethane-urea dispersions. They also relate to compositions which include urethane-urea dispersions ("UUD") and which also employ asphalt, natural and/or synthetic latex, or mixtures of all three, and may additionally employ other select additives or components. These other additives or components include other polymers or polymer-like material (e.g., in addition to latices and asphalt emulsions); pigments; fillers; biocides; antioxidants; and the like.Similar compositions and methods are known in the art; however, none of the art-disclosed compositions or methods provide the same combination of unique properties and advantages as the compositions and methods of the present invention. For example, Warach, in "Polyurethane Dispersions - Waterbased HighPerformance Adhesive Material," Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering, Vol. 61, Fall, 1989, published by the American Chemical Society, discusses the manufacture of 

 polyurethane dispersions, including those blended with vinylacetate/ethylene; vinylacetate; acrylic; and natural rubber (latex); as an adhesive. No mention is made of the inclusion of asphalt, or the importance of particle size when employing UUD as a sealant coating. U.S. 3,967,012, issued June 26, 1976 to Ebner, discloses a process for applying a coating to a surface by employing an aqueous suspension or dispersion selected from the group which consists of bitumens, asphalts, and tars; and moisture-resistant natural or synthetic rubbers or synthetic resin particles. The patentee further indicates that the primary coating substances may include one or more of the mentioned classes of compound such as a polymethyl
