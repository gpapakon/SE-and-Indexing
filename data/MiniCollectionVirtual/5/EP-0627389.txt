<ABSTRACT>
Glass polyhedra which can be employed especially as spacers making it possible to maintain a space between two sheets of glass. According to the invention these polyhedra have a substantially polygonal section whose dimensions are smaller than a millimetre and whose angles are rounded with a radius of curvature of less than 10 microns. The invention also provides a process of manufacture and a device for making use of it.

the sides of the cross-section have dimensions between 30 microns and 1 mm

and preferably between 50 and 200 microns.
Polyhedron according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
it is produced with a dimensional tolerance below 1 micron and with a good

regularity.
Polyhedron according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that
it is polished on at least certain of its faces.
Polyhedron according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
its refractive index is identical to that of the glass sheets.
Use of polyhedrons according to one of the claims 1 to 9 for 
maintaining a space between two material plates.
Use of polyhedrons according to one of the claims 1 to 9 as a spacer,
particularly for the separation of glass sheets which can have surface

films.
Use of polyhedrons according to claim 10 in order to maintain a space
between two glass sheets in the production of a display screen, such as a

plasma display, microdot display or electroluminescent display.
Process for the production of polyhedrons in accordance with one of the
claims 1 to 10, wherein drawing takes place of a starting bar with a polygonal

cross-section (1), advantageously polished on all its lateral faces,
said drawn bar being cut into several rods, said rods are collected parallel

to one another in such a way that they are well supported, they are
cut to the desired length, the ends of the rods are polished all together

and they are disengaged from one another.
Process according to claim 14, characterized in that drawing takes
place with a temperature rise of the starting bar to a level close to its

softening point and in that the bar is then drawn in at least two stages.
Process according to one of the claims 14 or 15, characterized in that
the rods obtained are collected in an e.g. glass cylinder, in that a wax

having a low melting point is poured in such a way that the rods are then
joined together within the cylinder.
Apparatus for performing the process according to one of the claims 14
to 16, comprising means for heating (4) and drawing (6) a starting bar having

a polygonal cross-section (1), means for cutting the drawn bar into
several rods, means for collecting together the rods, means for cutting the

collected rods and means for polishing the ends of the collected, cut rods.
Apparatus according to claim 17, characterized in that the heating
means are a ring (4) heated by low voltage Joule effect combined with a

mechanical system permitting the movement of the starting bar. 
Apparatus according to claim 17 or 18, characterized in that the
drawing means (6) are two drive belts.
Apparatus according to claim 19, characterized in that the belts are
made from a material preventing sliding on the glass, such as silicone.
