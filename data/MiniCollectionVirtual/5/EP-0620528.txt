<ABSTRACT>
With the method, parcels (1) are stored in a shelf or drawer store (11). Parcels (1) are stored immediately after being measured and identified. The quantities to be measured are the lengths of the edges of the parcel (1). On the basis of the measured quantities, the storage position (12), at which the parcel (1) is stored making optimum use of the storage area (11), is sought. The storage position (12) is recorded by a computer. The parcel (1) is removed from the store (11), with computer support, using a handling device (13), which has an output unit (23) in its working area.

A method of storing goods items (1) at a storage point (12) in a store (11) with storage
points (12) of different height which are restricted in height and are arranged one above

the other, in which the item (1) is measured, the dimensions 
(a
p
)
 of the item (1) being
used as the measuring size;


in which the item (1) is identified;
in which the dimensions 
(a
p
)
 are supplied in the form of a signal to a computer;
in which, with reference to the said signal, an appropriate storage point (12) is
selected, at which, taking into consideration the storage height, the respective item (1)

is deposited with regard to optimum utilization of the space of the store (11);
in which the store (11) used is in the form of a shelf or a drawer-type store;
in which the goods items (1) are stored exclusively adjacent to one another on the
storage surface of the storage point (12);
in which the goods items (1) are deposited directly on the storage surface after the
measurement and identification;
in which the position of the deposited goods items (1) is detected by the computer,
and in which the removal of the goods items (1) from the store (11) is assisted by the
computer.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the computer controls a handling
device (13) by which the item (1) is deposited in the correct position at the storage point

(12) selected by the computer.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the smallest dimension 
(a
p
)

of the item (1) is used when selecting the smallest possible storage height.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the goods items (1)
are introduced unsorted.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the goods items (1)
are identified during or at the end of their transportation, preferably by means of a bar 

code or by optical character recognition.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the measurement
takes place mechanically and/or opto-electronically.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the measurement
takes place electrically and/or electronically.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the measurement
takes place by ultrasound.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the shelf compartments
or the drawers respectively of the shelf or the drawer-type store respectively have

a height or a drawer screen (20, 20", 20"') which determines the position of the item (1) in
the corresponding shelf compartment or the corresponding drawer with maximum utilization

of the surface.
