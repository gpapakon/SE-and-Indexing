<ABSTRACT>
A compact and efficient image projection system (1) is described. The 
projection beam (11) supplied by a projector (3) is incident on a beam splitter (7) in the 

form of a cholesteric filter. The cholesteric filter (7) reflects circularly polarized 
radiation having a wavelength which corresponds to the pitch of the molecular helix and 

having a direction of rotation which corresponds to the direction of the molecular helix 
to a reflector (9). The circular direction of polarization reflected by the cholesteric filter 

(7) is inverted on the reflector (9) so that the beam (15) is subsequently passed to the 
screen (5) by the cholesteric filter (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image projection system comprising a
projector for supplying a projection beam which is modulated with the image to be
projected, an image projection screen and a folding system arranged between the image
projector and the image projection screen, the folding system comprising a beam splitter
for at least partly reflecting the projection beam from the projector, and a reflector for
receiving the part of the projection beam reflected by the beam splitter and for
reflecting said part to the beam splitter again.An image projector is herein understood to mean a device which is
provided with an image display system and optical means for projecting the image
generated by this system on an image projection screen. The generated image may be a
video image, a graphic image, data or a combination thereof.An image projection system of the type described in the opening
paragraph is known from European Patent Application 0 333 333. The image projection
system described in this Application includes a beam splitter which passes substantially
half the incident projection beam and reflects substantially half this beam to a reflector
which is arranged at the same side of the beam splitter as the projector. After reflection
on the reflector, half of the beam is passed by the beam splitter again and half of the
beam is reflected again. A drawback of this image projection system is a relatively low
efficiency, because only about 25% of the unpolarized radiation emitted by the projector
is incident on the image projection screen.It is an object of the invention to provide a compact image projection
system in which a much higher percentage of the projection beam supplied by the
projector is utilized for displaying an image on the screen, so that a more efficient
image projection system is obtained.The image projection system according to the invention is therefore
characterized in that the beam splitter is a cholesteric filter of
the type defined in the characterizing portion of claim 1. The image projector may consist of, for example one cathode ray tube and
one projection lens in the case of monochrome image projection, or of three cathode ray
tubes and three projection lenses in the case of a color image projection system. Such
an image projector supplies an unpolarized projection beam ad is described, for
example in United States Patent US-A 4,127,322.However, the image projector is preferably a LCD projector. In the case
of a color image projection system, the projector may comprise three

<CLAIMS>
An image projection system comprising a projector for supplying a projection
beam which is modulated with the image to be projected, an image projection screen and a

folding system arranged between the image projector and the image projection screen, the
folding system comprising a beam splitter for at least partly reflecting the projection beam

from the projector and a reflector for receiving the part of the projection beam reflected by the
beam splitter and for reflecting said part to the beam splitter again, characterized in that the

beam splitter is a cholesteric filter comprising a single layer of a liquid crystalline polymer
material, within which layer the pitch of the molecular helix varies across the layer thickness

between two values which correspond to the lower limit and the upper limit, respectively, of a
wavelength band required to cover at least the full visible wavelength range.
An image projection system as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that a
polarizer is arranged between the image projection screen and the beam splitter.
An image projection system as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that a λ/4
plate is arranged between the polarizer and the beam splitter, the polarizer having an absorbing

effect for the direction of polarization of the circular direction of polarization to be reflected
by the cholesteric filter after conversion by the λ/4 plate.
