<ABSTRACT>
The catheter has an outer winding. Individual coils (19) of the winding (18) are less axially movable relative to each other in one segment (24) of the jacket circumference, than in a second angle area of the jacket. The winding has sections of varying pitch in longitudinal direction of the jacket (10). The fluid chamber (16) and winding extend mainly over the complete length of the jacket. The winding has one section with a helix angle of approx. 35 degrees, located near the proximal end of the catheter. There is also a section with a larger or smaller angle, near the distal end.

A bendable guide catheter for medical purposes, having a working channel and a tubular
casing (10) which forms a chamber, extending in the longitudinal direction of the casing,

to receive a flowable medium, the casing (10) being resiliently stretchable through filling
the chamber with the flowable medium, and having a coil (18; 20) which is composed of

substantially non-stretchable material and which, relative to the longitudinal direction of
the casing (10), is along the extent of the chamber helically coiled around the casing (10)

with a defined angle of inclination, the individual turns (19; 21) of the coil (18; 20) being
displaceable relative to one another in the axial direction to a lesser extent in a partial

angular region (24) of the casing circumference than in another angular region of the
casing circumference, characterised in that in the longitudinal direction of the casing

(10), the coil (18; 20) has regions whose angles of inclination (α) differ.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the chamber
(16) and the coil (18; 20) extend over substantially the entire length of the casing (10).
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in one
of the regions, the coil (18; 20) has an angle of inclination (α) of approximately 35°.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that in one of the
regions, the coil (18; 20) is arranged adjacent to the proximal end of the guide catheter

with an angle of inclination (α) of approximately 35°.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that in one of the regions, the coil (18; 20) has an angle of inclination (α) greater than

approximately 35°.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that in one of the regions, the coil (18; 20) has an angle of inclination (α)

smaller than approximately 35°. 
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that one region of the coil (18; 20) is arranged adjacent to the distal end

of the guide catheter with an angle of inclination (α) which is not equal to approximately
35°.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that in the
direction of the proximal end of the guide catheter, starting from a region adjacent to the

distal end of the guide catheter, the angle of inclination (α) of the coil (18; 20)
approaches a value of approximately 35° as the distance from the distal end increases.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the coil (18; 20) has a region with a continually altering angle of inclination (α).
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that in the partial angular region (24) of the casing circumference, the

coil (18; 20) is held on an outer surface (15) of the casing (10) in a non-displaceable
manner.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the guide catheter comprises a reinforcement element (22) which

extends in the longitudinal direction of the casing (10) and on which the coil (18; 20) in
the partial angular region (24) of the casing circumference is held so as to not be

displaceable.
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 11, characterised in that the
reinforcement element is formed by a reinforcement fibre (22).
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with Claim 12, characterised in that the
reinforcement fibre (22) is positioned on the outer surface (15) of the casing (10) so as to

be parallel to a longitudinal axis of the casing (10). 
A bendable guide catheter in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the guide catheter has a second coil, the coils constituting two coils

(18, 20) which helically surround the casing (10) and which are coiled in opposite
directions.
