<ABSTRACT>
The method for the real-time elimination of the hidden parts of synthetic images of the invention starts from a data structure which breaks down the objects to be displayed into plane facets, links are established between facets having shared sides, and between sides sharing on each occasion a common vertex, the successive lines of the image to be displayed are scanned, the list sorted in the direction of scan of the sides intersected by the current scan line is compiled, the sorted list of segments to be drawn is compiled, and, with each insertion of a new segment into the list of open segments, the difference in depth between the point of insertion and the segments of the list of open segments is computed.
