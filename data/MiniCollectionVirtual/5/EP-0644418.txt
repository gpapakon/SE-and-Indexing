<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of a 
sample plate (60), 

the plate is placed in a prefabricated device containing 
a pair of thermocouples (52,54), 

a source (51) of heat flow into the plate, a heat sink (1) of 
the heat flow having an 

open cavity, a taut membrane (2), on which the source of heat 
flow and the 

thermocouples are bonded, located on the resilient filling, 
a resilient filling (61) of 

thermally insulating material located underneath the membrane, 
in the cavity of the 

heat sink, and a thermally insulating medium covering the 
plate and exerting a compressive force on it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of, and apparatus for, measuring
thermal conductivity, and more particularly measuring the thermal conductivity of
thin plates such as flat diamond plates or films.In the case of one-dimensional steady-state heat flow through a sample
body, its thermal conductivity K is given by
K = P/A(ΔT/Δx)
where P is the heat flowing per unit time along the x axis through a cross section of
the body, the cross section being oriented parallel to the yz plane and having an area
equal to A, and where ΔT is the temperature drop along a distance Δx measured
along the x axis as can be measured by attaching to the body a pair of localized
temperature sensors (thermometers), typically thermocouple junctions
(thermocouples), that are spaced apart in the x direction by the distance Δx. A direct
measurement technique that implements this one-dimensional heat flow is generally
described in the textbook Elementary Physics: Classical and Modern, by Richard T.
Weidner and Robert L. Sells, at pages 306-307 (1975).In that technique, a sample body in the form of a solid circular cylinder
("rod"), having a uniform cross section A and having a pair of end surfaces, is
surrounded by an insulating material, in order to minimize heat exchange into or out
of the sample body through its side surfaces. One end surface of the body is
maintained at a constant high temperature Th, as by means of a hot reservoir or heat
source, while the other end surface is maintained at a constant lower temperature Tc,
as by means of a cold reservoir or heat sink. In the steady state, the heat crossing
any cross section of the cylinder per unit time is equal to the same value P given by
eq. (1) above, and the temperature gradient ΔT/Δx is the same everywhere along the
rod, i.e., is independent of the x coordinate.In prior art, implementation of this sort of one-dimensional technique
has been cumbersome and time-consuming, stemming from the need for attaching
the heat reservoirs and the thermometers to the sample body each time a different
one is to be measured. Also, relatively lengthy and careful measurements are
required to account for, and correct for, heat losses. More specifically, the required
thermal insulation tends to get in the way of the thermometers (thermocouple
junctions) and their wiring, as well as in the way of the heat source and its 
wiring--the wiring, being fine (small diameter) and fragile, and having a tendency to
develop kinks and to be crunched by the required thermal insulating material.Turning to the
