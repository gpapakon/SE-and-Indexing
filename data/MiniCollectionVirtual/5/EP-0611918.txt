<CLAIMS>
Hand lamp for inspecting the underbodies, brakes, wheel 
bearings and the like of motor vehicles in test stands, 

comprising a casing (1) with a handle (2), at least one energy 
store (4) arranged in the casing, a light source with funnelshaped 

reflector, and switching elements for switching the light 
source on and off, characterised in that a plurality of emitting 

elements (8) are arranged on the casing (1), in such a way as to 
be distributed over the circumference of the casing wall, and are 

connected by way of an electric control circuit (10) to the 
energy store (4) and to actuating switches (11, 12), the control 

circuit having an IC element (15) and coding elements for the 
modulation of the actuating commands. 
Hand lamp according to Claim 1, characterised in that at 
least some of the actuating switches (5) and switching elements 

(11, 12) are constructed as toggle switches and are arranged on 
a common
1
 carrier (16), mounted in the wall of the handle (1), 
for the IC element (15) and the other electrical components. 
Hand lamp according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a place of deposit for the hand lamp is constructed as a charging 

station.
