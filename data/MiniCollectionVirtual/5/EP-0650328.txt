<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a method for producing decaffeinated and chlorogenic acid-depleted green coffee. The invention provides that the premoistened green coffee is treated with water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide, with the bulk green coffee in the extractor also subjected to pulsed water in the liquid state coming from above.

<CLAIMS>
The procedure for the reduction of caffeine and chlorogenic acids from raw coffee 
by extracting the moistened raw coffee with water-saturated, supercritical carbon 

dioxide is marked by the fact that - for the purpose of the drastic acceleration of 
decaffeination and the simultaneous reduction of chlorogenic acids - the raw 

coffee used for extraction and moistened with water is, in a pulsating manner, 
poured in the extractor and is, in addition, perfused from above with water in 

liquid form. 
The procedure according to claim 1 is marked by the fact that water ist added in a 
pulsating manner in 1 to 4 pulses per h, with a pulse width of 3 to 10 minutes, 

preferably 5 to 9 minutes and with reducing the pulse frequency at the end of the 
extraction, preferably to 1 pulse per h. 
The procedure according to claim 1 and 2 is marked by the fact that the water 
added in addition to the moistened raw coffee amounts to 0.5 to 10 g water / g 

raw coffee (dry mass) h, preferably 1 to 4 g water / g raw coffee (dry mass). 
The procedure according to claim 1 to 3 ist marked by the fact, that the water-saturated, 
supercritical carbon dioxide flows in a parallel or a reverse direction to 

the water added in addition.
