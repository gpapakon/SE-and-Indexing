<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of at least one isomer 
of inositoltrisphosphate (IP₃) for the preparing of a medicament 
for preventing, alleviating or combatting disorders related to 
transplantations in mammals including man. Transplantation or grafting of different organs or tissues to 
other areas on the body or to other individuals are of increasing 
incidence and importance. Improved surgical techniques and a 
better understanding of immunology problems are factors which 
contribute to the increasing importance. 
Transplantation of different organs and tissues such as hearts, 
kidneys, livers, bone marrow and skin are today quite common 
with kidney grafting being the most frequent one. 
Although transplantations have increased lately there is still a 
large potential for many more successful transplantations if 
some main problems can be solved. 
When an organ, which is to be transplanted, is taken out from 
the donor the blood flow is decreased and then stopped. During 
this period of ischemia many conditions are changed, which are 
detrimental to the organ and the function of the organ when 
introduced into the acceptor. Among other things the oxygen 
pressure is changed, which affects the appearance of oxygen-containing 
species. These species causes damages to constituents 
in the cell membrane, which deteriorates the function of the 
different cells in the tissue. 
After the organ is taken out from the donor there is always a 
period of time before the organ is transferred to the acceptor. 
During this time period the organ is preserved in either 37°C or 
in cold. Damage to the organ during this period decreases the 
function and the chance of survival of the organ. This means  
 
that in most cases the time between taking out the organ from 
the donor to grafting it into the acceptor must be very short. 
These conditions are of course very limiting to increasing the 
number of transplantations and for the performed transplantations 
to be successful. 
When introducing a new organ into the acceptor there is a phase 
when the blood starts to flow through the new organ. This 
reperfusion period is also very severe to the vitality and 
function of the organ. Also in this case there is an increased 
occurrence of reactive compounds, which negatively affects the 
organ. 
Another critical component when grafting an organ into an 
acceptor is the appearance of immunological problems. Many 
transplants are more or less rejected when introduced into a new 
body, which results in impairment
