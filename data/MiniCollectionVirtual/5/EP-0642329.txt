<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a joint prosthesis for permanent anchorage in the bone tissue of one of the articulatory parts of a joint in a human body, in particular the femur side of a knee joint, primarily intended to be fitted in one operation only. The prosthesis comprises an attachment part (1), intended to be anchored in the human bone tissue by means of a fixture (8), and an articulation element (2) adapted to fit the attachment part (1). The articulation element is attached to the attachment part by a combination of complementary shapes (27, 28, 33, 34) and snap-action locking means (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a joint prosthesis for
permanent anchorage in the bone tissue of one of the
articulatory parts of a joint in a human body, in
particular the femur side of a knee joint, primarily
intended to be fitted in one operation only, wherein
said prosthesis comprises an attachment part, intended
to be anchored in the human bone tissue by means of a
fixture, and an articulation element adapted to fit the
attachment part.The present invention is a development of a joint
prosthesis of the kind disclosed in WO89/09578.
This document thus inter alia discloses a femoral part
of a knee joint prosthesis comprising an articulation
element having an inner surface in the shape of an L.
This L-shaped articulation element comprises two
essentially planar parts oriented perpendicularly to
each other intended to be connected to a L-shaped
recess cut in the femur bone tissue. The prosthesis
also comprises an elongate intermediate element with a
first side intended to bear against the vertical part
of the L-shaped recess in the bone by means of at least
one fixture, and a second opposite side intended to
bear against one of the planar parts of the
articulation element. The intermediate element is in
the shape of an attachment bar having flanges provided
on said second side intended as a means for holding the
articulation element. The back part of the articulation 
element is also provided with an elongated means for
attachment, having a T-shaped cross section area,
intended to be inserted in said attachment bar and be
locked in a predetermined position by a locking device
which consists of locking lugs in the flanges of the
intermediate element.This prior art discloses a femoral part of a knee joint
prosthesis which can be fitted in one operation only,
which is advantageous since two operations may entail a
greater risk of infection and are troublesome for the
patient.The present invention is an improvement of the
prosthesis described above. Due to its shape it has a
large area for osseointegration resulting in a good
osseointegration in the bone tissue and thus a stable
and resistant anchoring in the femur. The parts of the
prosthesis all have a relatively simple construction
and are easy to fit during one operation. The fitting
of the articulation element to the attachment part is
also simple and stable.Other similar prior art is disclosed for instance in EP
0 183 669.According to the present invention there is provided a joint prosthesis for permanent
anchorage in the bone tissue of one of the

<CLAIMS>
A joint prosthesis for permanent anchorage in the bone tissue of one of the articulatory
parts of a joint in a human body, in particular the femur side of a knee joint, primarily in one

operation only, said prosthesis comprising an attachment part (1) which is adapted to be
anchored in the human bone tissue by means of a fixture (8) and an articulation element (2)

which is adapted to be fitted to said attachment part, wherein said attachment part presents
an inner surface (9, 9', 9'') adapted to bear on the bone tissue and an outer surface (20, 20',

20'') adapted to support said articulation element and said articulation element presents
surfaces (32, 32', 32'') shaped complementary to said outer surface of the attachment part,

wherein said outer surface of said attachment part is provided with flanges (21, 22) at two
sides which when said attachment part is anchored in the bone tissue are oriented

substantially in parallel with the direction of the articulation movement of the joint with each
flange being provided with a groove (27, 28) for guiding and holding beads or flanges (33,

34) presented by the articulation element when said articulation element is slid onto said
attachment part and wherein said attachment part is provided with a locking device (31; 45,

46, 47, 48, 49, 50) for locking said articulation element to said attachment part when said
articulation element has entirely been slid onto said attachment part 
characterised in that

said attachment part comprises first and second substantially planar parts (3, 4) oriented at
an angle relative to one another and an intermediate part (5) which connects the first and

second planar parts, that said grooves are oriented substantially in parallel with the second
planar part, that said guiding and holding beads or flanges are of a complementary shape to

the grooves and project from sides of said articulation element and that said locking device
is in the form of a snap-action lock arranged in said second planar part and/or said flanges.
A joint prosthesis according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the snap-action lock
comprises a resilient tongue (31) on the second planar part (4) of the attachment part (1)

which is adapted to resiliently engage in a recess (51) provided in the complementary
surface (32'') of the articulation element (2). 
A joint prosthesis according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the snap-action lock (45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50) is formed by resilient sections of the flanges (21, 22) on the outer

surface (20, 20', 20'') of the attachment part (1) which are provided with grooves (49, 50)
for resiliently holding beads presented on the articulation element (2).
A joint prosthesis according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the inner surface (9, 9', 9'') of said attachment part (1) presents one or more guiding and
stabilising flanges (10, 11, 12) for fitting into grooves (13, 14, 15) cut into the bone tissue.
A joint prosthesis according to claim 4, 
characterised in that

provided with one or more transverse grooves (40, 41, 42, 43) therein, and that one or
more of the guiding and stabilising flanges (11, 12) are adapted to fit into the transverse

grooves to lock said fixture against rotation.
A joint prosthesis according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the prosthesis comprises the fixture, that
