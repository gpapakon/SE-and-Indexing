<ABSTRACT>
Acoustic panels can be readily decorated by spraying single-coloured paint thereon. It is, however, often desired, instead of this, also to provide a multi-coloured pattern, which is decorative and/or represents figures, in order also to achieve visual effects with the aid of the acoustic panel. This can be achieved in transfer printing if the application, which is necessary for this purpose, of a backing layer, which is appropriate for paint, onto the cover layer, consisting of a glass fibre mat or fabric, takes place such that said cover layer remains porous and the functioning of the acoustic panel is thus ensured. For this purpose, it is provided that the individual glass fibres are already coated with the backing layer before a cover layer is formed from them.

<CLAIMS>
A decorated acoustic panel connectable to a room wall or ceiling
and comprising a porous supporting plate provided with a porous

surface on one or both sides for sound and / or thermal insulation
and at least one thin covering layer which is applicable to the

supporting plate and formed from a non-woven fabric or a woven
fabric of glass fibres and which can be decorated by transfer

printing, characterised in that the individual glass fibres of the
covering layer are coated all over with a thin carrier layer of an

ink-affinitive plastics so that the carrier layer remains porous
between the glass fibres to an extent such that the decoration

appears visually to be complete, but the sound and thermal
radiation striking the covering layer is nevertheless absorbable by

the supporting plate.
A decorated acoustic panel according to claim 1, characterised in
that the carrier layer comprises thermoplastics.
A method of manufacturing a decorated acoustic panel according
to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the glass fibres are coated

with the carrier layer, and the covering layer is subsequently
formed from the coated glass fibres. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the covering
layer


a) is provided with the carrier layer,
b) is attached to the supporting plate, and
c) is decorated by transfer printing.
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the covering
layer


a) is provided with the carrier layer,
b) is decorated by transfer printing, and
c) is attached to the supporting plate.
A method according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that, for
decoration of the covering layer, the latter is covered with a

transfer printing substrate, and the decoration, comprising a
sublimable disperse dye, is transferred from the transfer printing

substrate to the carrier layer under relatively low pressure and by
means of heat.
A method according to claim 6, characterised in that the transfer
is carried out in such a manner that less than 3.5 g/m
2
 of
disperse dye is sublimed onto the covering layer. 
A method according to claim 7, characterised in that between
2.5 g/m
2
 and 3.0 g/m
2
 of disperse dye is sublimed onto the
covering layer.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in
that the decoration is transferred at approximately 150Â°C.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 9, characterised in
that the transfer printing substrate is subjected to heat and

pressure treatment for approximately 90 seconds.
