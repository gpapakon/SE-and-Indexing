<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring physical properties of 

micro area which has an object to measure physical 
properties from a micro area on an atomic scale on the 

surface of a test sample such as electron spin, 
nuclear magnetic moment, and nuclear quadrupole moment 

in high sensitivity, allows the probe 2 of the atomic 
force microscope to approach the surface of the test 

sample 1, applies a magnetic field to the test sample 
1 by the magnetic field generation coil 27 and the 

magnetic paths 22 to 26 and furthermore a high 
frequency electromagnetic field to the test sample 1 

by the coils 16 and 17 respectively, and detects a 
signal from atoms existing on the surface of the test 

sample 1 which are resonant with the high frequency 
electromagnetic field by the probe 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention applies to a probe
microscope such as a tunneling microscope or atomic
force microscope for observing and measuring the shape
of a micro area on the surface, local electronic
state, or local nuclear state.When physical property information such as
electron spin, nuclear magnetic moment, and nuclear
quadrupole moment is measured, it is very difficult
conventionally to measure the two-dimensional or
three-dimensional local distribution of, for example,
impurities and defects in a semiconductor sample, even
if the rate thereof in the whole is very low. The
reason will be described hereunder. For example, in
the case of electron spin resonance (ESR), the minimum
number of spins Nmin which can be detected is
expressed by the following equation.
Nmin = (κT/µ2)(ΔH/Ho)(1/π2Qoηξ)(κTdΔf/2Po)1/2
where Po indicates the power of incident
electromagnetic wave (Vo2/2Ro), Td temperature of the
detector, Δf a band width of the detection apparatus
which is about 1 Hz to 10 kHz, Qo a constant 
representing the sharpness of resonance of the cavity
resonator which is up to about 5000 at no load, ΔH
width of the adsorbed wave, Ho intensity of the
magnetic field, T power transmission factor from the
oscillator to the cavity resonator, κ a Boltzmann
constant, µ magnetic moment of spin, η a coefficient
indicating the degree of effect of the magnetic
behavior of the sample on the electromagnetic
characteristics of the entire cavity resonator, and ξ a
coefficient derived from the cavity resonator which is
between 1/3 and 1/8. When they are obtained by
practical numerical values, the minimum number of
spins which can be detected is at most 106 to 108 even
in an ideal case. Therefore, it is quite difficult to
analyze, for example, impurities and defects existing
in a semiconductor sample or on the surface thereof on
an atomic scale by this means.Recently, on the other hand, a probe microscope
using a micro probe as a detector such as a scanning
tunneling microscope has be used widely as a means for
structure observation and analysis of a sample surface
on an atomic scale. Recently, a means for detecting
the electron spin resonance phenomenon of a sample
placed in a magnetic field by the micro probe of the
aforementioned probe microscope has be proposed. This 
is indicated, for example, in Physical Review Letter,
Vol. 62, No. 21, p. 2531 to 2534 and Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 5040100. The means detects
ESR indirectly and has been proposed on the assumption
that a tunneling current is changed at
