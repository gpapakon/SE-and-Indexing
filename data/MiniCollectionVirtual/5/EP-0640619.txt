<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to erythropoietin analogs having at least one additional site for glycosylation or erythropoietin
analogs having a deletion of one or more glycosylation sites in human erythropoietin and an addition of an
equal number of non-naturally occuring glycosylation sites. The invention also relates to DNA sequences encoding said
erythropoietin analogs, and recombinant plasmids and host cells for analog expression.Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone involved in the maturation or erythroid progenitor cells into erythrocytes.
It is essential in regulating levels or red blood cells in circulation. Naturally occurring erythropoietin is produced
by the liver during fetal life and by the kidney of adults and circulates in the blood and stimulates the production of red
blood cells in bone marrow. Anemia is almost invariably a consequence of renal failure due to decreased production of
erythropoietin from the kidney. Recombinant erythropoietin produced by genetic engineering techniques involving the
expression of a protein product from a host cell transformed with the gene encoding erythropoietin has been found to
be effective when used in the treatment of anemia resulting from chronic renal failure.Low levels of erythropoietin are normally present in human urine, while individuals suffering from aplastic anemia
exhibit elevated levels of urinary erythropoietin. The purification of human urinary erythropoietin by Miyake et al. in J.
Biol. Chem., 252, 5558 (1977), used, as starting material, urine from aplastic anemic individuals. To date, however, urinary
erythropoietin has not been shown to be therapeutically useful.The identification, cloning, and expression of genes encoding erythropoietin are described in U. S. Patent No.
4,703,008 to Lin, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A description of a method for purification
of recombinant erythropoietin from cell medium is included in U. S. Patent No. 4,667,016 to Lai et al. The expression
and recovery of biologically active recombinant erythropoietin from mammalian cell hosts containing the erythropoietin
gene on recombinant plasmids has, for the first time, made available quantities of erythropoietin suitable for therapeutic
applications. In addition, knowledge of the gene sequence and the availability of larger quantities of purified protein has
led to a better understanding of the mode of action of this protein.Many cell surface and secretory proteins produced by eucaryotic cells are modified with one or
