<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for a preassembled construction of pressure-contactable disc-cell semiconductors in which a loosely stacked assembly consisting of disc-cell semiconductors, the appropriate connector tags and end cooling and insulating cells retains its content until final assembly by means of loose securing by means of insulating tubes which act as insulators for the screws to be used subsequently to clamp the assembly, for which purpose one end of the insulating tubes is fitted with a flange engaging behind a shared securing plate while the other end is taken through a shared insulator via which the assembly is axially secured by frictional coupling to the insulating tubes by means of a clamping strip. To improve the fixing and axial securing to prevent the individual components from falling apart, the invention proposes that the securing plate (3) and the insulator (2) be axially movably guided over the insulating tubes (13), the securing plate (3) being supported via spring components (18) on the flanges (13a) of the insulating tubes (13) and a positive locking component being allocated to the insulating tubes which permits limited axial movement.
