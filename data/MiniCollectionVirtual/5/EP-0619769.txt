<ABSTRACT>
A coated abrasive backing consisting of an endless, seamless, loop is provided. The backing loop includes 40-99 % by weight of an organic polymeric binder, based upon the weight of the backing; and an effective amount of a fibrous reinforcing material engulfed within the organic polymeric binder material. The endless, seamless backing loop includes a length with parallel side edges, and at least one layer of fibrous reinforcing material engulfed within the organic polymeric binder material such that there are regions of organic binder material free of fibrous reinforcing material on opposite surfaces of the layer of fibrous reinforcing material. The fibrous reinforcing material can be in the form of individual fibrous strands, a fibrous mat structure, or a combination of these. A method for preparing the endless, seamless backing loop for a coated abrasive belt is also provided. The method includes the steps of preparing a loop of liquid binder material having fibrous reinforcing material therein around the periphery of a drum; and solidifying the binder material such that an endless, seamless, backing loop having fibrous reinforcing material engulfed within the organic polymeric binder material is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to coated abrasive articles, and particularly
to coated abrasive belts with endless, seamless backings containing an organic
polymeric binder and a fibrous reinforcing material. Additionally, this invention
pertains to methods of making endless, seamless backings for use in coated
abrasive belts.Coated abrasive articles generally contain an abrasive material, typically in
the form of abrasive grains, bonded to a backing by means of one or more
adhesive layers. Such articles usually take the form of sheets, discs, belts, bands,
and the like, which can be adapted to be mounted on pulleys, wheels, or drums.
Abrasive articles can be used for sanding, grinding, or polishing various surfaces
of, for example, steel and other metals, wood, wood-like laminates, plastic,
fiberglass, leather, or ceramics.The backings used in coated abrasive articles are typically made of paper,
polymeric materials, cloth, nonwoven materials, vulcanized fiber, or combinations
of these materials. Many of these materials provide unacceptable backings for
certain applications because they are not of sufficient strength, flexibility, or
impact resistance. Some of these materials age unacceptably rapidly. Also, some
are sensitive to liquids that are used as coolants and cutting fluids. As a result,
early failure and poor functioning can occur in certain applications.In a typical manufacturing process, a coated abrasive article is made in a
continuous web form and then converted into a desired construction, such as a
sheet, disc, belt, or the like. One of the most useful constructions of a coated
abrasive article is an endless coated abrasive belt, i.e., a continuous loop of coated
abrasive material. In order to form such an endless belt, the web form is typically
cut into an elongate strip of a desired width and length. The ends of the elongate
strip are then joined together to create a "joint" or a "splice."Two types of splices are common in endless abrasive belts. These are the
"lap" splice and the "butt" splice. For the lap splice, the ends of the elongate strip 
are bevelled such that the top surface with the abrasive coating and the bottom
surface of the backing fit together without a significant change in the overall
thickness of the belt. This is typically done by removing abrasive grains from the
abrasive surface of the strip at one of the ends, and by removing part of the
material from the backing of the elongate strip at the other end. The bevelled ends
are then overlapped and joined adhesively.
