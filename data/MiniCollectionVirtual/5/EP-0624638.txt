<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to novel fuel compositions 
for internal combustion engines and to methods for using 
such fuel compositions, novel lubricating oil compositions 
and novel nitrogen containing compositions. Over the years, fuels used in internal combustion 
engines have contained various kinds of additives to 
improve performance of the fuel or to alleviate problems 
arising during the use and combustion of fuels in internal 
combustion engines. During the 1950's and 1960's, engine 
designers generally focused their efforts towards the 
development of high-performance engines, with little 
concern about fuel economy or exhaust emissions. The fuel 
delivery system for engines of this era involved the use 
of carburetors to deliver an air-fuel mixture, via a 
manifold, to the cylinders for combustion. Primary 
concerns at this time were carburetor icing, adequate 
octane value, deposit formation on carburetor surfaces, 
fuel stability and the like. Additives for fuels such as 
anti-icing agents, lead-containing fuel additives, 
detergents, and various antioxidants generally resulted in 
adequate performance. Deposits in other parts of the fuel 
delivery system were not of a major concern because such 
engines were generally tuned to a rich air/fuel ratio 
allowing for mixture malfunction. Greater power-weight 
ratios meant that the driver was less apt to notice  
 
changes in peak power and fuel economy, and exhaust 
emissions were not a serious concern at that time. It wasn't until the energy shortages of the 1970's, 
and, at about the same time, increased awareness of 
environmental concerns, that changes directed to purposes 
other than improving engine output began to receive 
widespread attention. During this time, and up to the 
early 1980's, government regulations in the United States 
and in other countries throughout the world imposed 
increasingly stringent limitations on exhaust emissions 
and on fuel consumption. Efforts to comply with these 
requirements involved various engine modifications, 
smaller vehicles, smaller engines, and increasingly 
widespread use of light weight materials. Only minor 
changes were made to fuel handling systems during this 
time other than efforts to control evaporative hydrocarbon 
emissions. During this time, consumers did become aware 
of the importance of fuel intake system cleanliness to 
maintain acceptable fuel consumption limits. By the early 1980's, the carbureted internal 
combustion engine began to give way to throttle-body fuel 
injection
