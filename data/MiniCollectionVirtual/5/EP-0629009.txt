<ABSTRACT>
A steel plate having a plated layer on the upper and 
lower surfaces thereof to be processed into a battery can 

which is cylindrical and open in one end thereof by drawing 
and ironing processing. The plated steel plate has more than 

1.2 as a rank hoard value (r) which is a width deformation 
degree in a lengthwise direction thereof/a thickness deformation 

degree in the lengthwise direction thereof, a width 
deformation degree in a widthwise direction thereof/a 

thickness deformation degree in the widthwise direction 
thereof, a width deformation degree in an oblique direction 

thereof/a thickness deformation degree in the oblique 
direction thereof. In-plane anisotropy Δr which is the 

difference among the rank hoard values (r) is set to be less 
than ±0.15 so that the elongation coefficient of the plated 

steel plate in lengthwise, widthwise, and oblique directions 
is almost constant, i.e., so that the generation of earring 

can be prevented in drawing and ironing a sheet comprising the 
steel plate into the battery can. In order to make the 

elongation coefficient of the plated steel plate constant in 
the three directions, a very low carbon steel plate is used. 

The steel plate is cold-rolled at 80-90%. The plated layer 
is allowed to have a granular structure by annealing it after 

it is plated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery can to 
be processed by drawing and ironing, a sheet for forming the 
battery can, and a method for manufacturing the sheet. Normally, a cylindrical battery can comprises a 
closed surface, which is disposed at one end thereof and 
serving as a positive side and an opening portion, which is 
disposed at the other end thereof and serving as a negative 
side, on which a cover is installed. The battery is manufactured 
by progressive pressing method as shown in Fig. 1. According to progressive pressing method, a coiled 
steel sheet S to be processed into battery cans is punched 
into a plurality of circular substrates M. Deep drawing is 
performed on each of the substrates M to form a cylindrical 
wall M-2 vertically on the peripheral surface of a bottom 
surface M-1 as shown in Fig. 1. Then, deep drawings are 
repeatedly performed in 8-12 processes to manufacture a 
cylindrical pipe to be used as a battery can having a required 
depth and diameter. In the progressive pressing method, the cylindrical  
 
wall M-2 is drawn so that the thickness of the cylindrical 
wall M-2 becomes almost equal to that of the bottom surface 
M-1. Therefore, when the sheet S is drawn at 0.25µm, the 
thickness of the cylindrical wall of a battery can becomes 
approximately 0.24µm. Because the outer diameter of the 
battery can is regulated, preferably, the thickness of the 
battery can is formed to be as small as possible to make the 
inner diameter thereof large so that the space in the battery 
can is great, i.e., a greater amount of filler can be supplied 
to the battery can so as to increase the electric power of a 
battery. In the conventional progressive pressing method, 
however, the thickness of the cylindrical wall and the bottom 
wall are reduced to the same percentage and yet it is 
necessary to make the thickness of the bottom wall larger than 
a required thickness. That is, it is difficult to reduce only 
the thickness of the cylindrical wall greatly. Accordingly, 
it is difficult for the conventional progressive pressing 
method to increase the electric power of the battery because 
a large amount of filler cannot be charged in the space of the 
battery. In addition, it is also difficult to reduce manufacturing 
cost because many processes are required to manufacture 
the battery can. Drawing and ironing process method as shown in Fig. 
2 has been recently developed as a method for manufacturing  
 
the battery can. According to this method, a steel sheet S 
is drawn and
