<ABSTRACT>
A butterfly valve with a disc (1) having two separate side-by-side 
peripheral edges (3,4) separated by a channel (5). The peripheral edges (3,4) 

are eccentrically disposed to one another and seat with a suitably shaped 
valve seat (2) e.g. a sealing ring having one or more outlets (24,25). 
If one of the edges (3 or 4) leaks e.g. due to damage or a trapped 
particle, the fluid is prevented from passing to the other side of the disc by 

the second edge (3 or 4) and drains away along the channel (5) through the 
or each outlet (24 or 25). Thus the danger of unwanted mixing or 

contamination is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a butterfly valve. Conventionally a butterfly valve comprises a disc and a seat 
such as an annular elastomeric seal against which the disc engages 
when the valve is closed. Sometimes, either the disc edge or the seat 
is damaged, or particulate matter becomes wedged between the disc 
edge and the seat, and leakage of fluid occurs. In some situations a 
small amount of leakage can be tolerated but in others it is definitely 
not, particularly when contact or mixing of materials which would 
otherwise be separated by the valve disc can have dangerous 
consequences. In order to overcome this problem it has been proposed to use 
a valve having two discs spaced apart longitudinally along the 
channel through which fluid is flowing, the two discs being linked 
together mechanically so as always to be parallel with one another. 
This arrangement is intended to ensure that if leakage of fluid past 
one disc occurs, then the other prevents further leakage or flow. 
However the provision of two discs and a linkage which accurately 
maintains the parallel arrangement for two discs at all angles from the 
open to the closed position is expensive and since the linkage is 
positioned outside the valve body is likely to become damaged, thus 
causing one disc to no longer be parallel to the other. DE-C-1096134 discloses a flap valve positioned in a valve body, the 
flap comprising two parallel elastically deformable lips for sealingly 
engaging the interior of the valve body in the closed position and a channel 
located between the lips which connects to an outlet in the valve body in 
the closed position whereby any fluid leaking past one lip flows along 
the channel and out through the outlet. GB-A-1512482 discloses a butterfly valve according to the 
precharacterising part of claim 1. Since the two peripheral edges are 
centred on the same axis, on closing, one edge has to be pushed past 
the deformable seating surface for the other edge. This causes  
 
excessive wear and possible damage to the edge(s) and/or seating 
surface(s). Furthermore, unless a mechanical stop is provided, it is 
easy to rotate both edges beyond their respective seating surfaces. It is an object of the present invention to provide a butterfly 
valve construction which overcomes or reduces the effects of the 
above problems. In accordance with the invention a butterfly valve comprises 
a body, a valve disc disposed in said body for sealing engagement 
with a valve seat of deformable material associated with said

<CLAIMS>
A butterfly valve comprising a body, a valve disc (1) disposed in said 
body for sealing engagement with a valve seat (2) of deformable material associated 

with said body, wherein the valve disc has two parallel peripheral edges 
(3,4), each of circular form in the open and closed condition of the valve, a 

channel (5) being defined between said peripheral edges (3,4) which 
connects to an outlet (24 or 25), whereby when in a closed position any fluid 

leaking past one peripheral edge (3 or 4) of the disc flows along the said 
channel (5) and to the outlet (24 or 25), characterised in that the centres (C,A) of the two parallel 

peripheral edges (3, 4) are eccentrically disposed with respect to the 
rotational axis (O-O) of the disc (1) in the open and closed conditions of the 

valve, the centre (C) of one edge (3) being disposed on one side of the 
rotational axis (O-O) of the disc (1) and spaced apart therefrom by a preset 

distance (B-C) measured in the plane of the disc and the centre (A) of the 
other edge (4) being disposed on the other side of the rotational axis (O-O) of 

the disc (1) and spaced apart therefrom by a distance (A-B) measured in the 
plane of the disc equal to said preset distance (B-C), the valve seat (2) 

having two generally 
cylindrical seating surfaces (22, 23) eccentrically disposed with respect to one another against which each of the two peripheral 

edges (3,4) respectively seats in the closed condition of the valve. 
A butterfly valve according to claim 1 characterised in that the outlet 
(24 or 25) comprises at least one port formed in the valve seat (2). 
A butterfly valve according to either of claims 1 or 2 characterised in 
that the outlet (24 or 25) is positioned to communicate with the channel (5) 

in the closed position of the valve. 
A butterfly valve according to any one of claims 1, 2 or 3 characterised 
in that the seat (2) is in the form of a sealing ring and the outlet (24 or 25) 

leads through said sealing ring to the exterior of the valve. 
A butterfly valve according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the two circular forms of each of the peripheral edges 

(3,4) are of equal diameter. 
A butterfly valve according to any one of the preceding claims  
 

characterised in that the two circular forms of each of the peripheral edges 
(3,4) are interrupted by flat surfaces (10,11) ) adjacent to the two diametrically 

opposed positions where the disc is connected to one or two shafts. 
A butterfly valve according to claim 6 characterised in that the flat 
surfaces (10,11) interrupt the channel (5) between the two edges (3,4) and 

at least one groove (12,13,14) is provided in the flat surface (10,11) to 
connect the interactive parts of the channel (5). 
A butterfly valve according to any one of the preceding claims
