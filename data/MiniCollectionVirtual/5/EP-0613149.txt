array blocks (CAB1) each having at least one word line 

(WL11) and associated with a word line drive circuit (PD1a, 
WD1a, RD1), a block select circuit (BSa) for selectively

cell array blocks wherein the word line drive circuit is 

associated with an address latch circuit (AL1a) which 
latches and continuously outputs one of the word address 

signals thereto, the block select signal activates the 
address latch circuit for latching one of the word address 

signals, the word line drive circuit cotinuously activates 
the word line according to an output signal (AL1aout) of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device, more particularly to a dynamic type random access
memory device capable of partial activation of a memory cell
array that is divided into a plurality of blocks.Recently the partial activation technique in RAM
devices has been developed in which a memory cell array is
divided into a plurality of memory cell array blocks and
selectively activated to output read data and/or to receive
write data. According to this technique, only one or a few
memory cell array blocks are activated to connect certain
memory cells selected in accordance with address signals to
bit lines and other memory cell array blocks are maintained
in deacvtivated states in which the bit lines remain in
precharged state. Therefore, in the device performing the
partial activation operation, the current consumption owing
to charging and discharging the bit lines, that is, voltage
inversions on the bit lines, which do not correspond to the
selected memory cells is decreased. In particular, since
the current consumption of the RAM device is mainly caused
by the voltage inversion on the bit lines, the total current
consumption of the RAM device is effectively decreased. This type of prior art device is explained with
reference to Fig. 11 and 12. As shown in Fig. 11, the RAM
device comprises n block areas B1, Bn, a timing controler TC
for receiving control signals RAS, CAS, an address buffer
AB1 for receiving a row address signal AddR and a block
address signal AddB which is associated with an refresh
counter RC for outputting the row address signal AddR and
the block address signal AddB to the address buffer AB1 in
order to refresh certain memory cell array blocks CAB1,
CABn, an address buffer AB2 for receiving an column address
signal AddC and a block selector for outputting block
selection signals SL1, SLn. The block area B1 has a memory
cell array block CAB1 including the memory cells MC111 each
associated with a word line WL11 and the bit line pair
BL111a, BL111b, a sense amplifier circuit SA1 associated
with a sense amplifier driver SAD1 which outputs a high
level signal to activate the sense amplifier circuit SA1
according to the high level state of the block selection
signal SL1, a column selector CS1 associated with a column
decoder CD1 which is activated according to the high level
state of the signal SL1, a row decoder RD1 associated with a
word driver WD1 which outputs a high level signal to
activate the row decoder RD1 according to the high level
state of the signal SL1, an
