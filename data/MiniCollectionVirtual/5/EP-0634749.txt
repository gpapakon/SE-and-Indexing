<ABSTRACT>
A recording and reproducing apparatus can translate a 
detecting device for detecting information, such as the kind and 

content of tape cassette and a reel lock mechanism releasing 
device to proper positions corresponding to tape cassettes of 

different sizes. A tape cassette information detecting means 
(71) and reel lock releasing means (72a, 72b) can be translated 

to positions at which large and small tape cassettes are in use 

through a swing drive member (54), a translating lever (73), a 
driving link (74), a detection mechanism holding member (75) and 

a reel lock releasing plate (77) in unison with a movement of 
reel mounts (44, 45).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to recording and reproducing apparatus.Recording and reproducing apparatus can have loaded thereinto two
tape cassettes of different sizes in which spacings between a supply
reel and a take-up reel around which a recording medium tape is wrapped
are different and two reel mounts that are respectively in engagement
with the supply reel and the take-up reel can be translated at
different positions.Recording and reproducing apparatus has been proposed in which
two reel mounts can be translated to different positions. This
recording and reproducing apparatus includes detecting means for
detecting information, such as the kind of a tape cassette and a tape
cassette content disposed at a common position of a mechanical deck
portion so that the detecting means can be served for both tape
cassettes of different sizes. Alternatively. this recording and
reproducing apparatus includes detecting means disposed at
corresponding positions of respective tape cassettes and the detecting
means which is not in use is disposed at the position in which it may
not disturb the other one when each of the tape cassette is loaded onto
the recording and reproducing apparatus in use.Further, similarly, the recording and reproducing apparatus
includes a reel lock mechanism releasing means for releasing a reel
lock mechanism which prevents tape reels from being rotated within the
tape cassette. This releasing means is 
disposed at the common position of the mechanical deck portion
so that the releasing means can be served for both tape
cassettes of different sizes. Alternatively, the recording and
reproducing apparatus includes the releasing means at the
positions corresponding to the respective tape cassettes so that
the releasing means that is not in use is disposed at the
position so as not to disturb the other releasing means when the
two tape cassettes are loaded onto the recording and reproducing
apparatus in use.When however the recording and reproducing apparatus
is used under the condition that the detecting means for
detecting information, such as the kind of the tape cassette and
the tape cassette content and the reel lock mechanism releasing
means are not translated, there is then the disadvantage that
the size and the weight of members on the mechanical deck
portion are increased.Furthermore, depending on tape formats, the detecting
means and the releasing means interfere with other members, such
as the tape cassette or the mechanical deck so that the
detecting means and the releasing means cannot

<CLAIMS>
A recording and reproducing apparatus that is capable of having one of two
differently sized tape cassettes (1; 21) loaded therein, the cassettes each having a

supply reel (6; 26) and a take-up reel (7; 27) and a recording medium tape (5; 25)
wound therebetween, the supply and take-up reels (6, 7; 26, 27) of the two differently

sized cassettes (1; 21) each having a different separation, wherein the apparatus
comprises:


a pair of reel mounts (44, 45) which are each engageable with a respective one
of the supply and take-up reels (6, 7; 26, 27) of the one cassette when loaded in the

apparatus, the reel mounts (44, 45) being translatable to different positions dependent
upon the size of the loaded cassette;

   characterised by:

releasing means (72a, 72b) provided in said recording and reproducing
apparatus for releasing a reel lock mechanism (13; 33) of the cassette (1; 21)when

loaded therein, the reel lock mechanism inhibiting the supply and take-up reels (6, 7;
26, 27) from being rotated within the cassette, said releasing means (72a; 72b) being

translatable to different positions dependent upon the size of the loaded cassette.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, comprising:

detecting means (71) provided in said recording and reproducing apparatus for
detecting information, such as kind and content, of said tape cassette; and
means (74, 75, 76) for translating said detecting means to different positions
dependent upon the size of the loaded cassette.
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said detecting means (71) is
translatable in unison with a movement of said reel mounts (44, 45).
An apparatus according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein the detecting means
(71) is translatable in unison with said releasing means (72a, 72b). 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, comprising a tape cassette positioning
mechanism (81) provided in a member (75) which is translatable together with said

detecting means (71).
