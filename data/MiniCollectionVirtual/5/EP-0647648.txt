<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel optically active phosphorus compounds of the formula 
<
IMAGE
>
  wherein   R and R
<
1
>
 independently of one another are hydroxyl, a protected hydroxyl, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy and R
<
2
>
 and R
<
5
>
 independently of one another are alkyl having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl or aryl, or R
<
2
>
 and R
<
3
>
 or R
<
4
>
 and R
<
5
>
 together with the phosphorus are a group of the formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 with the proviso that R
<
2
>
 is not simultaneously equal to R
<
3
>
 and R
<
4
>
 is not simultaneously equal to R
<
5
>
, the preparation of compounds of this type, their use for enantioselective reactions, such as e.g. asymmetric hydrogenations, enantioselective hydrogen displacements in prochiral, allylic systems and the like, and also complexes of the compounds of the formula I with metals of group VIII.
