<ABSTRACT>
An improved apparatus for automated, localized 
adjustment of the web thickness is provided that includes 

means for compensating for temperature variation along the 
apparatus width. In a preferred embodiment, the automated 

adjustment assembly (32) includes web thickness-controlling, 
thermal energy sources, and disposed proximate to the 

thermal energy sources, heat pipe means (70). Beneficially, a 
generally isothermal environment is provided proximate to 

the automated adjustment assembly (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 876,492, filed on April 30, 1992, 
and entitled "WEB THICKNESS CONTROL". This invention relates to improved control of 
web thickness. As exemplified by U.S. Patents 3,761,553 to 
Richardson, 3,920,365 to Mules, and 4,332,543 to Fulton et 
al, an extrusion apparatus having a plurality of thermal 
energy sources spaced part across the apparatus width, and 
providing for localized changes in web thickness based upon 
localized viscosity changes, is known. The web thickness 
is decreased or increased in response to induced localized 
thermal gradients. The Richardson apparatus also includes 
manually-operated, lip gap adjustment members. As illustrated by U.S. Patents 4,281,980 to 
Hoagland et al, 4,252,519 to Farmer et al, 4,594,063 to 
Reifenhauser, 4,726,752 to Van Dun, and 5,020,984 to 
Cloeren, an extrusion apparatus providing for automated, 
localized lip gap adjustment, is known. The lip gap is 
adjusted in response to automated means for providing 
control of web thickness. In the type of apparatus illustrated by the 
Farmer et al patent, the lip gap is adjusted by thermal 
energy sources disposed within a die blade. To prevent 
temperature variations from affecting the melt temperature 
as the melt exits the die, the blade lip is maintained at a 
constant temperature. The '980 apparatus includes a heat 
barrier means for circulating of a cooling medium. In the type of apparatus exemplified by the Van 
Dun and Cloeren patents, common cooling of thermally-controlled,  
 
lip gap adjustment members is provided to level 
out various temperature influences. In the Van Dun patent, 
a cooling medium is forced perpendicular to the adjustment 
members through channels provided in a cooling block that 
surrounds the adjustment members. Collectors for supply 
and discharge of the cooling medium are in fluid 
communication with the channels. Two sets of channels 
having opposite flow, may be used. According to U.S. 
Patent 4,863,361 to Boos, considerable energy is wasted in 
flowing a cooling medium around thermally-actuated, lip gap 
adjustment members. Therefore, it may be understood that different 
approaches have been used to provide an improved apparatus 
for control of web thickness. However, these prior efforts 
continue to be unsatisfactory. Thus, there continues to be 
a need for an improved apparatus, and in particular for an 
improved extrusion apparatus, for controlling web 
thickness. Advantageously, such an apparatus would
