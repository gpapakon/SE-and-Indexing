<ABSTRACT>
An oil-in-water emulsion is prepared with certain
siloxane-oxyalkylene copolymeric surfactants which have in

the emulsion a combined HLB value of between 4-7. The oil
phase includes silicone oils which are volatile and silicone

oils or gums which are non-volatile or mixtures of silicone
oils and gums. What is unexpected and unusual about the

invention is that conventional wisdom dictates that
surfactant packages having a combined HLB value of 4-7 result

in water-in-oil emulsions rather than oil-in-water emulsions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to oil-in-water 
emulsions containing silicone surfactants which have a 
combined HLB value of 4-7. This is unusual because it is 
known that emulsions containing surfactants with HLB values 
of 4-7 are water-in-oil emulsions and not oil-in-water 
emulsions. The HLB system is based on the concept that a 
surfactant molecule has an attraction for both water and oil 
and that the relative magnitude or the hydrophile-lipophile 
balance (HLB), of these attractions measures its suitability 
as an emulsifier for a given oil. The HLB system is based 
upon a numerical rating scale of from 0 to 20. There are two basic types of emulsions, that is, 
water-in-oil emulsions and oil-in-water emulsions. There is 
a required HLB value for each type of emulsion. Water-in-oil 
emulsions require an HLB value of 4-7. Oil-in-water 
emulsions require an HLB value of 8-18. Generally, no 
emulsions result with an HLB value below 4 or an HLB value 
above 18. Since oil-in-water emulsions require an HLB value 
of 8-18, it is therefore highly unusual and unexpected that 
one could prepare an oil-in-water emulsion with HLB value 
required for water-in-oil emulsions. This is the gist of 
the present invention. The emulsion prepared by the present invention is 
an oil-in-water emulsion. The oil phase typically contains 
a silicone fluid such as a volatile cyclic silicone or a 
volatile short chain linear silicone, a linear non-volatile 
silicone or mixtures of silicone fluids; and an ethylene 
oxide/propylene oxide silicone copolymer which will be  
 
referred to hereinafter as an "EO/PO Silicone Surfactant". 
The water phase typically contains an ethylene oxide 
silicone copolymer which will be referred to hereinafter as 
an "EO Silicone Surfactant"; or the water phase may contain 
an "EO/PO Silicone Surfactant"; water; and if desired, other 
adjuvants such as electrolytes and humectants which 
typically occur in personal care consumer cosmetic products. The "EO/PO Silicone Surfactant" is a siloxane 
polyether having the formula: 
wherein Ra is an alkyl group of one to six carbon atoms; Rb 
is the radical -CmH2m-; Rc is a terminating radical which 
can be hydrogen, an alkyl group of one to six carbon atoms 
or an aryl group such as phenyl; m has a value of two to 
eight; p and s have values such that the oxyalkylene 
segment -(C₂H₄O)p-(C₃H₆O)s- has a molecular weight in the 
range of 400 to 5,000; the segment preferably having fifty 
to one hundred mole percent of oxyethylene units -(C₂H₄O)p- 
and one to
