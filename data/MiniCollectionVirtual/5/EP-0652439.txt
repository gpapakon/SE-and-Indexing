<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor accelerometer (10) is formed with a 
sensor plate (14) that remains substantially planar when 

acceleration forces are applied. The sensor plate (14) is 
supported by support beams (16, 17, 18, 19) that are attached 

to the sensor plate (14) at constraint points (26, 27, 28, 29). A 
portion (33) of the mass of the sensor element (20) is 

cantilevered outward past the constraint points (26, 27). 
During the application of acceleration forces, the cantilevered 

mass (33) creates a counterbalancing moment that maintains 
the sensor plate (14) in a substantially planar state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
semiconductors, and more particularly, to semiconductor
accelerometers.In the past, the semiconductor industry has utilized a
variety of structures and methods in forming semiconductor
accelerometers. One class of prior accelerometers utilizes
two series capacitors having two fixed parallel plates and a
movable planar sensor element suspended between the two
fixed plates. The sensor element forms a third plate that is
common to both capacitors. As acceleration forces cause the
sensor element to move closer to one of the fixed capacitor
plates, the capacitance value of the accelerometer varies.
External electronics coupled to the accelerometer detect the
change in capacitance value. One disadvantage of such prior
semiconductor accelerometers is the attainable accuracy.
Typically, the acceleration forces not only cause the sensor
element to move but also cause the center portion of the sensor
element to flex or sag so that the sensor element is no longer
planar. The flexure causes one portion of the sensor element to
be closer to one capacitor plate than other portions of the
sensor element, thus, the capacitance variation is no longer
linearly related to the force applied to the accelerometer.
Additionally, the flexure or sagging reduces the distance
between the sensor element and the capacitor plates. Often the
plate to sensor element distance is small enough to allow
electrostatic attraction forces to force the sensor element
against the capacitor plate thereby electrically shorting the
accelerometer. Accordingly, it is desirable to have a semiconductor
accelerometer sensor element that does not flex in response to
acceleration forces, and that has a substantially linear
relationship between capacitance value and applied
acceleration force.FIG. 1 illustrates an enlarged cut-away perspective view
