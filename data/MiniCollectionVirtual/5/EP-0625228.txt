<CLAIMS>
Device for collecting rain water from inside a
drain pipe, comprising :


a saddle (1) adapted to be fitted to the drain pipe and
having an orifice (31) coincident with the orifice formed on

the drain pipe, the saddle (1) fastening the device to the
drain pipe,

characterised in that it comprises :

a scoop (9) adapted to be compressed to insert it into the
drain pipe through an orifice formed in the side of said pipe

and adapted thereafter to resume its shape to collect water
flowing in said drain pipe and to remove it from said pipe,
an outside part of scoop, passing through the saddle (1) to
remove water from said 
drain pipe.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the saddle (1) is in the form of a collar and comprises

locating means (7) for locating it on the drain pipe.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in
that the saddle (1) locating means comprise a shoulder (7)

entering the orifice in the drain pipe.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it further comprises fastening means

(10, 30) for fastening to the saddle (1) a tap body (2)
extending the scoop (9) outside the drain pipe.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in
that the fastening means comprise planes which are coincident

with each other.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in
that the fastening means comprise grooves (10) and bosses

(30) preventing the tap body (2) from rotating when it is
nested in the saddle (1).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the scoop (9), in its part inside the

drain pipe, is inclined to remove water, its lowest point
being the point nearest the orifice (31) in the saddle (1).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the scoop (9) is elastic. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the scoop (9), in its part inside the

drain pipe, comprises an outside edge, which is wholly or
partially in contact with the inside wall of said drain pipe

to collect water flowing therein.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the part of the scoop (9) inside the

drain pipe occupies only part of the cross-section area of
the drain pipe, to enable surplus water to flow.
