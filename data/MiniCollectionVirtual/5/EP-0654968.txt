<ABSTRACT>
An anti-microbial composition for non-pharmaceutical cleaning of contaminated materials, bodies and surfaces, especially contaminated liquids and gases, comprises at least one anti-microbially active protein which has been isolated from mussels, preferably together with glycogen. A quick test for qualitative testing of possibly contaminated liquids, especially drinking water, comprises a test tube containing a predetermined amount of the anti-microbial composition. A predetermined amount of the liquid is added to the test tube, shaken and allowed to sediment. The quality of the liquid is determined by a quality indicator extending along the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anti-microbial treatment of microbially
contaminated materials, bodies and surfaces in general, and in particular to
anti-microbial treatment of microbially contaminated water and other liquids,
gases and gas mixtures. The invention is also concerned with microbial testing
of such materials, bodies and surfaces. As used herein the term "anti-microbial
treatment" means that the treatment results in neutralization or inactivation
of at least part of the contaminating microbes and preferably of all of the
contaminating microbes. As used herein the term "microbes" includes toxins.
For simplicity reasons the term "cleaning" is in this specification sometimes
used instead of anti-microbial treatment.Microbial contamination is a great problem in many situations. One of
the greatest global problems is the cleaning of water, both in developed and
developing countries. Water, especially drinking-water, is a scarce resource
which has to be re-used. Before using or re-using water as drinking-water it is
highly desirable to make sure that the water is clean enough so that it does not
constitute a health hazard for the humans or animals who have to drink it.In the developed countries the problem with contaminated water, especially
microbially contaminated water, is most pronounced in urban areas where
the drinking-water often is circulated in very large distribution systems. It is
usually required that the drinking-water should meet certain standards (prescribed
by state, local or other jurisdiction) as regards e.g. physical, chemical
and biological properties. Consequently, many procedures have been developed
for mechanical, chemical and biological cleaning of water in order to meet these
standards. Such cleaning is usually carried out at one or only a few central
cleaning stations in the distribution network, and it quite often happens that
the cleaned drinking-water becomes re-contaminated during the transport in the
distribution system from the cleaning station to the end user. Another frequent
problem is that one of the most efficient cleaning treatments, viz. the use UV-radiation,
requires absolutely particle-free water in order to be effective. The
presently available procedures for eliminating particles (such as sedimentation,
flotation, sieving and the like) are, however, incapable of eliminating small
microbial particles, so UV-radiation may not inactivate such particles even at
the cleaning/disinfecting station. In many developing countries, and also in parts of developed
