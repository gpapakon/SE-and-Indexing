<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adaptive filter module means according
to the introductory part of claim 1 and to a method of minimizing
the error in an active noise cancellation system according to the
introductory part of claim 9.It is concerned with an LMS filter chip that can be used as a building
block in low cost noise cancellation applications.Prior art adaptive canceller filters have consisted of software code
in digital computers, often in digital signal processors (DSP) microprocessors
such as the TMS320C25 by Texas Instruments or as discrete
hardware components in analog systems. The software - DSP
methods lack speed while the analog methods contain an excess of
parts and lack adaptability.INMOS has produced a multiply-accumulate chip, the IMS A100, that
can be used to implement digital filters but no method is provided
for adaptation of the filter coefficients. In U.S. Patent No. 5,105,377 an active noise cancellation system applying
the Digital Virtual Earth (DVE) algorithm is disclosed. This
active cancellation system receives a phenomena input signal representing
residual phenomena to be cancelled. It has an adaptive filter
in form of a processor of which no explicit architecture is
given. This filter outputs a cancellation signal fed to an actuator
means for providing active cancellation of noise.It is the object of this invention to provide a standard adaptive
filter module for FIR or IIR filters that can operate at high speed.Another object is to provide the architecture for a filtered-x adaptive
filter module.A still further object of this invention is to provide an adaptive
filter module that will reduce the amount of hardware in active
noise cancellation apparatus.Furthermore, it is an object of this invention to provide a novel filtered-x adaptive filter for enhancing
the operation of the digital virtual earth (DVE) algorithm.These and other objects are achieved by the system of claim 1 and by
the method of claim 9. The invention will become apparent when reference
is had to the accompanying description and drawings.The current invention overcomes the prior art limitations while providing
a standard adaptive filter module that can operate at high
speed, reduces hardware parts count and will lead to reduced cost
from volume production.It works with the Digital Virtual Earth (DVE) algorithm and the AFF
algorithm which achieves noise cancellation without requiring either
a noise reference or a sync signal as described in U.S. Patent No.
5,105,377. It also works with the Filtered-x class
