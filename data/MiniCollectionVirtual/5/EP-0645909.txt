<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission system with a matching circuit (2) to compensate for frequency and/or phase fluctuations between an incoming and an outgoing frame-aligned signal. The matching circuit (2) contains a buffer memory (5) for temporary storage of the signal data, a write address generator (6) which generates cyclical write addresses and serves to control the process of writing to the buffer memory (5) and a read address generator (7) which generates cyclical read addresses, serves to control the process of reading from the buffer memory (5) and is provided in order to generate, within a predefined area of each frame of the outgoing signal, at least one duplicate read address when a positive padding operation is indicated by a control signal and to skip at least one read address when a negative padding operation is indicated by the control signal. Furthermore, a padding decision circuit (9) is provided which is coupled with the read and write address generator (7, 6) and which serves to generate the control signal.

A transmission system comprising a matching
circuit (2) for compensating fluctuations in

frequency and/or phase between an incoming and an
outgoing frame-synchronised signal, characterised by


a buffer memory (5) for temporary storage of
the signal data,
a cyclic write-address generator (6) generating
write addresses for controlling the writing

operation in the buffer memory (5),
a cyclic read-address generator (7) which
generates read addresses for controlling the

operation of reading out of the buffer memory (5)
and which, during a preset region of each frame of

the outgoing signal, on indication of a positive
filling action by a control signal, is adapted to

generate a read address at least twice and, on
indication of a negative filling action by the

control signal, is adapted to skip at least one read
address,
a phase detector (8) for forming the difference
between a write address and a read address and for

generating at least one phase value during each
frame and
a filling decision circuit (9) adapted to
generate the control signal from the phase value.
A transmission system according to claim 1,
characterised in that the filling decision circuit

(9), during each frame of the outgoing signal, is
adapted at least once to generate the control 

signal, which indicates a negative filling action if
a phase value falls below a first threshold value

and indicates a positive filling action if a phase
value exceeds a second threshold value which is

greater than the first threshold value.
A transmission system according to claim 2,
characterised in that the filling decision circuit

(9) contains a quantiser (20) adapted to compare the
phase value with the first or second threshold value

once in each frame.
A transmission system according to claim 2 or
3, characterised in that a frame evaluating circuit

(11) is provided for receiving the outgoing
synchronised signal and for detecting the preset

region.
A transmission system according to claim 4,
characterised in that during each preset region of a

frame, the frame evaluating circuit (11) is adapted
to generate a release pulse for the quantiser (20),

and in that the quantiser (20) is adapted to form
the control signal during the occurrence of the

release pulse.
A transmission system according to claim 4 or
5, characterised in that a multiplexer (12) is

provided for receiving the outgoing frame-synchronised
signal and a sequence of code words

delivered by a coder (10), in that the coder (10) is
adapted to generate a sequence of code words from 

the control signal indicating a positive or a
negative or no filling action, and in that the frame

evaluating circuit (11) is adapted to generate a
change-over pulse which transmits a code word to the

output of the multiplexer (12) during the arrival of
a preset byte of a frame at an input of the said

multiplexer (12).
A transmission system according to any of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the write

address generator (6) and the read address generator
(7) are adapted to form write and read addresses

coded in accordance with a one-step code and in that
the phase detector (8) contains a subtractor (15)

adapted to receive read and write addresses and to
form a sequence of phase values.
A transmission system according to any of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the frame-synchronised

signal is an STM-1 signal of the
synchronous digital hierarchy and in that the preset

region is the first byte (first column) in the fifth
row of the STM-1 frame.
A matching circuit (2) for compensating
fluctuations in frequency and/or phase between an

incoming and an outgoing frame-synchronised signal,
characterised by


a buffer memory (5) for temporary storage of
the signal data, 
a cyclic write-address generator (6) generating
write addresses for controlling the writing

operation in the buffer memory (5),
a cyclic read-address generator (7) which

generates read addresses for controlling the
operation of reading out of the buffer memory (5)

and which, during a preset region of each frame of
the outgoing signal, on indication of a positive

filling action by a control signal, is adapted to
generate a read address at least twice and, on

indication of a negative filling action by the
control signal, is adapted to skip at least one read

address,
a phase detector (8) for forming the difference
between a write address and a read address and for

generating at least one phase value during each
frame and
a filling decision circuit (9) adapted to
generate the control signal from the phase value.
