<ABSTRACT>
The described device comprises a supporting element (5) 
defining a plurality of housings (9) in which respective 

microlamps (6) can be inserted. The thread-like 
terminals (6a) of each microlamp (6) abut on an inclined 

bottom wall (10) so that they cross an outlet slot (12) 
and each of them engages in an auxiliary slot (17) 

communicating with a coupling seat (14) in which an 
electric resister (7) is subsequently engaged by forced 

fitting. The supporting element (5) is coupled by snug 
fitting with a small board (2) carrying connecting 

conductors (3) consisting of elastic small plates each 
acting on one of the resisters for urging it in contact 

with the respective thread-like terminal (6a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feeding and 
supporting device for electric components, of the type 
comprising the features recited in the preamble of claim 
1. In greater detail, the present invention, in the 
embodiment described, is conceived for making control 
panels having signal lights of the type usually 
associated with household electrical appliances, being 
obviously understood that the innovatory concepts herein 
disclosed may be also utilized for uses different from 
the described ones. It is known that in producing control panels of the type 
associated with household electrical appliances, 
lighting installations or other electrical apparatus, 
the arrangement of signal lights suitably connected to 
respective electric circuits is usually provided for the 
purpose of informing the operator, through switching on 
or off of each of the lights, about the operating state 
of one or more electric members to which the control 
panel is interlocked. Generally, said signal lights essentially consist of 
bulb microlamps suitably connected, upon interposition 
of electric resistors connected in series and/or in 
parallel, to respective connecting connectors arranged 
in the form of a printed circuit on a small connecting 
board also having the function of mechanically 
supporting the microlamps. Connection of the microlamps and respective electric 
resistors to the conductors arranged on the small 
connecting board can be carried out for example by 
directly welding thread-like terminals associated with 
the microlamps and/or the electric resistors on the  
 
small board itself. In other cases, a supporting element is provided to be 
associated with each signal light, which supporting 
element comprises a block of plastic material embodying 
appropriate contact elements for the operating 
engagement of the electric resistors, the thread-like 
terminals associated with the bulb microlamp being 
connected to said contact elements and being partly 
buried in the plastic material forming the block. Said 
contact elements are connected to a pair of terminals 
designed to be welded on the small connecting board made 
in the form of a printed circuit. However the execution of said connecting operations by 
welding involves some problems both in terms of working 
costs and times and in terms of production flexibility 
in the automated installations presently in use in the 
manufacturing centers, as well as in terms of stock 
management of the produced pieces. Documents DE-A-2 030 160 and GB-A-2 145 577
