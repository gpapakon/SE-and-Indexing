<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to multi-user digital data transmission
over bandlimited channels and, more particularly, to code division multiple access to the
bandlimited channels.The potential demand for ubiquitous wireless communications combined
with restricted availability of the radio frequency spectrum has motivated intense
research into bandwidth efficient multiple access schemes. A recent reference entitled
"Spread Spectrum for Commercial Communications", by Schilling et al, as published in
IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 29, No. 4, April 1991 discusses one avenue of
approach, namely, Spread Spectrum Code Division Multiple Access (SS-CDMA)
techniques, to effect multiple access communication.Conventional CDMA techniques take advantage of available bandwidth
on the transmission medium, such as a fiber optic cable or the radio spectrum, by
generating a set of pulses in the time domain which have appropriate correlation
properties over predetermined time periods. Typically, the correlation property is such
that a particular receiver tuned to a given transmitter code produces a detectable signal
whenever the given transmitter code is presented to the receiver during each time period,
whereas the output of the receiver is near zero for any other transmitter code presented to
the receiver. A CDMA system operating on this time domain correlation property and
utilizing a set of codes designated the optimal orthogonal codes was disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,779,266.In the article entitled "Coherent Ultrashort Light Pulse Code-Division
Multiple Access Communication Systems", appearing in the Journal of Lightwave
Technology, by J. A. Salehi, A. M. Weiner, and J. P. Heritage, March, 1990, Vol. 8,
No. 3, a technique for encoding a sequence of ultrashort pulses for transmission over an
optical channel is disclosed. The encoding is effected by modulating the phase
characteristic of the Fourier transform of a stream of ultrashort light pulses corresponding
to a sequence of data symbols. Each transmitter is assigned a unique code to modulate
its corresponding stream, and a receiver tuned to that unique code can detect the data
symbols impressed on the short pulses by the associated transmitter. As disclosed,
encoding is accomplished, at optical frequencies, by an arrangement of grating elements
and a multielement phase modulator. There is no teaching or suggestion in the art of any technique to generate a
transmitter pulse which is power limited and which must match to a channel having
bandwidth
