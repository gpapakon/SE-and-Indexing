<ABSTRACT>
An algorithm is described for sparsely updating the filter coefficients of an adaptive filter of an adaptive audio system to facilitate a high sampling rate without excessive processing capacity. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the potential for using an inverse filter matrix to manipulate the position of stereophonic images. The possibilities suggested could be used in conjunction with existing stereophonic recordings in order to improve stereophonic imaging in situations where the relative locations of loudspeakers and listener are constrained to be non-ideal. In one arrangement, real sound sources (S1, S2) provide to the listener the impression that the sources are at more widely-spaced positions (V1, V2). In another arrangement, employing four sound sources (S1, S2, S3, S4) the impression is created at two listener locations (M1, M2; M3, M4) that the sound is coming from a pair of sound sources positioned symmetrically of those listener locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sound reproduction systems and more particularly
to sound reproduction systems incorporating multi-channel signal
processing techniques.The invention is concerned with sound reproduction systems arranged to
generate 'virtual source locations' of sound at positions other than those of
actual loudspeakers employed to reproduce a sound field.WO-A-9 000 851 and EP-A-0 450 819 each relates to sound reproduction
systems comprising loudspeaker drive means for a plurality of
loudspeakers, wherein the loudspeaker drive means comprise digital filter
means.The relevant teaching of these references are acknowledged in the precharacterising
portion of the following paragraph.According to the present invention, a sound reproduction system comprises
a plurality of loudspeakers for positioning at positions spaced from a
listener location, loudspeaker drive means for driving the loudspeakers in
response to a plurality of channels of a sound recording, the loudspeaker
drive means comprising a filter means, the sound recording being suitable
for playing normally through a plurality of speakers normally positioned
generally symmetrically with respect to a listener location, characterised in
that the filter means comprise digital filter means and the characteristics of
the digital filter means are so chosen as to create, in use of the reproduction
system, at the listener location a local sound field which is substantially
equivalent to the local field that would result from playing the sound
recording through a plurality of loudspeakers driven without said digital
filter means and positioned at virtual source locations, at least one of the 
virtual source locations being displaced substantially from the actual
location of the corresponding loudspeaker, the digital filter means being
designed in order to approximately reproduce in the sound field the desired
signals which are specified by the use of a filter matrix used to relate the
desired signals to the recorded signals.Thus, the digital filter means is arranged to compensate for the asymmetric
positioning of the loudspeakers with respect to the listener location.For example, with reference to Figure 1, a transfer function matrix C(z) of
electro-acoustic transfer functions relates loudspeaker inputs to the outputs
of microphones placed at the location of the listener ears in the sound field.
A matrix H(z) of inverse digital filters can be used to process conventional
two-channel stereophonic recorded signals prior to transmission by the
loudspeake
