<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the oxidation of water. The apparatus includes a pressure tank (6) and a water pump (5) as well as a pump means (2, 9) provided with a mobile float (2), a piston or a membrane, said pump means being connected to an intake pipe (7) between water pump (5) and a bottom valve in a manner that the pressure fluctuations of intake pipe (7) produce the movements of said float, piston or membrane. The movements of a water column, a piston or a membrane carrying said float (2) are adapted to operate an air pump (2, 10) for delivering the air into the water to be oxidized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for the 
oxidation of water. An apparatus of the invention is 
suitable for use in all cases, wherein the water-intake 
system includes a pressure tank and a water pump. For 
example, when drawing well water, such equipment is 
already there and thus the oxidation of well water can be 
effected with the invention at very little extra costs. 
There are also a large number of various reservoirs, both 
natural and man-made reservoirs, wherein the dissolution 
of oxygen in water would be necessary for the purification 
of water and the improvement of its quality. As known in the art, the oxidation can be used for 
substantially improving the quality of water. For example, 
well water can be processed to reduce its iron content and 
various contaminants dissolved in water. However, a 
problem has been the non-existence of suitable, 
sufficiently simple and effective oxidizing equipment. If, 
for example, the operating power of a well-water oxidizing 
apparatus requires its own electric connection, the 
equipment and fitting costs will be so high that the 
project is usually forgotten. On the other hand, by virtue 
of large-scale manufacturing, the water pumps and pressure 
tanks are relatively inexpensive pieces of equipment and, 
thus, can be economically used even where they have not 
been previously required for the drawing of water but 
where an effective oxiding apparatus is needed. An object of the invention is to provide a simple, 
effective and inexpensive oxidizing apparatus, which can 
be adapted to most diversified applications and which only 
requires a single electric connection for the operation of 
a water pump.  
 This object is achieved by means of the invention on the 
basis of the characterizing features set forth in the 
appended claim 1. Three exemplar embodiments of the invention will now be 
described in more detail with reference made to the 
accompanying drawing, in which 
fig. 1is a schematic view showing the structure and 
operation of one exemplary embodiment of the 
invention. Fig. 2is a schematic view showing the structure and 
operation of a second exemplary embodiment. Fig. 3is a schematic view showing the structure and 
operation of a third exemplary embodiment. The embodiment of fig. 1 will be described first as 
adapted to the oxidation of well water. Drawing of water from a well is effected in a conventional 
fashion by means of a water pump 5 and a pressure tank 6 
through an intake pipe 7 and a bottom valve 1. The water 
is

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the oxidation of water, said apparatus 
comprising a pressure tank (6) and a water pump (5), 


characterized
 in that a pump means (2, 9; 2', 
9'; 2a, 
9a) operating on the pressure fluctuations of 
water is connected to an intake pipe 7 between water pump 

(5) and a bottom valve in a manner that the pressure 
fluctuations of intake pipe (7) as a result of the 

operating and standing cycles of water pump (5) produce 
the movements of a water column carrying a float (2), a 

piston (2a) or a membrane (2') included in the pump means, 
said movements being adapted to supply a driving force for 

an air pump (2, 10; 2', 10'; 10a), from which the air is 
delivered into the water to be oxidized. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the piston of air pump (2, 10) 

comprises a water column (9), contained in a cylinder (3) 
and carrying on its surface a float (2) whose top and 

bottom sides are provided with sealing surfaces (17, 19) 
which, in the top and bottom position of float (2), 

respectively seal air pipes (11, 12) included in the top 
end of cylinder (3) and a water pipe (8) included in the 

bottom end thereof. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that said air pipes (11, 12), which 

provide intake and pressure pipes for an air pump, are 
extended as a coaxial pipe through a plug (23) closing the 

top end of cylinder (3), and the bottom end of the coaxial 
pipe is surrounded by an annular bulge (16) which is in 

cooperation with said sealing surface (17). 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized
  
 

in that the air pump comprises a bellows 
(10a) or a like having a change of volume which is 

multiple on each pumping strike compared with the change 
of volume of pump means (2a, 9a) serving as its driving 

device. 
An apparatus as set forth in any of claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that a tube or a hose is used 
to fit said pressure tank (6) with an atomizing nozzle 

(14), through which the pressure tank is allowed to 
gradually deplete. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that a valve (4a) between pressure tank 

(6) and atomizing nozzle (14) is used to control the 
frequency of the operating cycles of water pump (5). 
The application of an apparatus as set forth in any of 
claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that the 
apparatus is used for the oxidation of well water.
