<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to memory cells, and more
particularly to a flash E2PROM cell having only a single
polysilicon-containing layer.Fig. 1 shows a typical flash E2PROM cell 10 of the
prior art. The cell 10 is made up of a transistor 11
having a substrate 12 of, for example, P type
conductivity, with a source 14 and a drain 16 of N type
conductivity along a surface of the substrate 12, the
source 14 and drain 16 defining therebetween a channel
region 18 along the surface of the substrate 12.
Overlying the channel region is an oxide layer 20, on
which is disposed a first polysilicon layer 22. The
polysilicon layer 22 has disposed thereon an oxide layer
24, which in turn has disposed thereon a second
polysilicon layer 26. The polysilicon layer 22 is the
floating gate of the transistor 11, while the polysilicon
layer 26 is the control gate thereof.As is well known, threshold voltage of the transistor
11 can be changed by addition of electrons to the floating
gate 22, or removal of electrons therefrom. In adding
electrons to the floating gate 22 (programming the cell
10), typical of a flash E2PROM cell, the control gate 26
and drain 16 are held at a high positive voltage, while
the source 14 is held at ground, the voltage being
sufficient to bring the transistor 11 into an avalanche
condition, so that hot electrons pass through the oxide 20
into the floating gate 22. For removal of electrons from
the floating gate 22 (erasing the cell 10), again typical
of a flash E2PROM cell, a high positive voltage is applied
to the source 14, while the control gate 26 is held at 
ground, so that electrons are drawn from the floating gate
22 through the oxide 20 to the source 14.It has been found that this sort of device, called a
"double poly" device because of the two polysilicon layers
used therein, is difficult to manufacture, being sensitive
to slight variations in the manufacturing process. This
results in devices which do not function as desired or may
not function at all.A prior art cell 30 containing only a single layer of
polysilicon 32, is shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. As shown
therein, a P type substrate 34 has N regions 36, 38, 40,
and elongated N region 42 formed therein, with the N
regions 36, 38 separated by P region 44 and the N regions
38, 40 separated by P region 46.An oxide layer 48 (removed from Fig. 2 for clarity,
but portions of which are shown in Fig. 3 and 4) is
disposed over the structure thus described, with thin
regions 47A, 47B, 47C, 47D over the regions 44, 46, 40 and
42 respectively with
