<ABSTRACT>
A composite blade (10, 10A through 10F) for use in a tire cure mold on the method of fabricating the composite blade employs the steps of forming a blade blank (12) and encapsulating at least one end (14, 16) in a second material by placing the end (14, 16) in a die and molding an enlarged cross section (20) of a second material around the end (14, 16). Preferably the second material is a powdered metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blades for the curing mold. More particularly to
a composite type blade which has rounded ends and a method of fabricating such
composite blades.Blades for tire curing molds are well known in the art of tire manufacture. Such
blades are conventionally made from a running length or strip of a metallic material such
as steel, stainless steel or brass. The strip is generally about 0,020 inches (0,5 mm) to
0,040 inches (1 mm) thick and has a width of about one half to 1-1/2 inches (12,7 to 38
mm). Sometimes the strips are of solid form other times perforated strips are used to
form the blade.In US-A- 3,880,020 a method and apparatus for making blades is disclosed
which enables small quantity lots of a multiplicity of different styles of blades to be made
rapidly and economically. The method and apparatus permits blades to be blanked out
from the stack of material by a plurality of punch and die sets while the stock remains
securely attached to an endless loop carrier. The invention uses a plurality of sub-presses
for forming bends in the blade if desired.In US-A- 3,581,535 a similar method and apparatus for making blades is
disclosed. The method and apparatus for making blades for use in tire molds includes
piercing, notching, bending or otherwise altering the shape of a free end of strip material
by successively positioning the free end and a plurality of shape altering tools in
operative engagement and cutting off the formed blade from the free end.The reader can appreciate or visualize finished blades of a given style falling into
a large box after being formed and cut from the strip of blade stock.The complexity of this automated blade forming apparatus make it abundantly
clear that the formed blade must be rather simple in construction as shown in the
appended prior art Figs. 4 through 9. Bends, cuts, notches and holes are possible. What
has not been possible to date was the employment of more complex shapes or varying
the thickness of the blade at a specific location.Fr-A- 2,137,309 disclose the features recited in the
preamble of claim 1.The blade creates a sipe, which is a narrow groove or incision in the tread. The
lateral ends of the blade, even if polished or ground round is a subsequent deburring
operations, are sufficiently narrow to initiate crack propagation at this highly stressed
region of tread. To avoid this problem it has been an objective of the present invention to create
blade ends and blade bends that are effective at stress relieving the tread

<CLAIMS>
A blade (10) for use in a tire mold including:

a metal blade blank (12) having at least two ends (14, 16);
at least one end cap (20) having a substantially larger cross-section relative to the
metal blade blank (12), the end cap (20) being attached to one end (14, 16) of the metal

blade blank 
characterized in that
 the at least one end cap (20) is of a second material the
second material being a powdered metal molded to form an enlarged end at least partially

encapsulating the one or more ends (14, 16) of the blade blank (12).
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein at least one of the ends (14, 16) of the metal
blade blank (12) is crimped.
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein at least one of the ends (14, 16) of the metal
blade blank (12) is notched.
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein the metal blade blank (12) has one or more
bends (18) between the two ends (14, 16).
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein the blade (10) further is 
characterized by
 bend
caps (30), the bend caps (30) having substantially rounded cross-section, each bend cap

(30) being a powdered metal molded to the metal blade blank (12) at a bend (18).
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein the blade blank (12) is steel.
The blade (10) of claim 1, wherein of the end cap (20) cross-section is
substantially rounded.
A method of fabricating the composite blade (10) for use in a tire mold of claim 1
comprising the steps of:


forming a metal blade blank (12) having at least two ends (14, 16);

   
characterized in that
 placing one or more ends (14, 16) of the metal blade blank
(12) in a die and molding a second powdered metal material forming an end cap (20) at

least partially encapsulating the one or more ends (14, 16) of the metal blade blank (12).
The method of fabricating a composite blade (10) of claim 8 further include the
step of crimping the one or more ends (14, 16) of the metal blade blank (12) prior to 

molding a second powdered metal material, thus, encapsulating the crimped end (14,
16).
The method of fabricating a composite blade (10) of claim 9, further includes the
step of notching the one or more ends (14, 16) of the metal blade blank (12) prior to

molding the second powdered metal material, thus, encapsulating the notched end (14,
16).
The method of fabricating a composite blade (10) for use in a tire mold
comprising the steps of


forming a metal blade blank (12) having two or more ends (14, 16) and at least
one bend (18) located between the two ends (14, 16); 
characterized in that
 placing at
least one bend (18) of the metal blade blank (12) in a die and molding a second

powdered metal material forming a bend cap (30) at least partially encapsulating the
bend (18) of the metal blade blank (12).
