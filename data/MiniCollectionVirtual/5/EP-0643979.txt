<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microcatheter 
comprising a tube-like basic body with at least one lumen 

extending from a distal to a proximal end, for which a 
connecting member has been applied to the proximal end and 

wherein, in the direction from the proximal towards the 
distal end, the diameter of the basic body decreases, over 

at least part of its length, and the flexibility increases, 
wherein the decrease in diameter and the increase in 

flexibility are obtained in that a flexible layer of 
material has a substantially constant thickness over the 

length of the catheter and the thickness of a stiff layer of 
material decreases from the proximal towards the distal end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catheter as defined
in the introductory part of claim 1. Such a catheter is
known from US-A-5 061 257.In this known catheter the portion at the
distal end of the basic body, also called the tip
portion, has a smaller diameter than the basic body and
an increased flexibility. This is achieved in that only
the flexible layer of material tends into the tip
portion. This known catheter specifically is an
angiographic catheter. The relatively flexible tip
portion is favourable for preventing trauma to the
patient.The invention has for its object to provide a
catheter having the features of the introductory portion
of claim 1, also for preventing trauma to the patient,
but being specifically intended for use in the tortuous,
small blood vessels in the human brain. At the distal end
such a 
catheter should be pliable to such an extent that it can
pass through very small bends, smaller than 5 mm, in the
vascular system of the brain. At the same time the catheter
should be sufficiently stiff towards the proximal end to
transmit the longitudinal forces when introducing and
manipulating the catheter. Furthermore, these qualities must
be combined in a catheter of which the distal end must be
capable of penetrating into very narrow blood vessels with a
diameter considerably smaller than 1 mm.The microcatheter according to the invention as
characterised in claim 1 has the properties with which these
aims can be achieved.During catheterization the catheter is introduced
into a relatively wide blood vessel and advanced from there
to ever narrower vessels. Towards the proximal end the
thickness of the catheter may therefore be greater, without
limiting the accessibility of the very small blood vessels.
Because of the somewhat greater thickness close to the
proximal end, the microcatheter can be manipulated properly.A desired increase in the pliability towards the
distal end is already achieved due to a decrease in the
diameter but is additionally enhanced, by using relatively
stiff material close to the proximal end and increasingly,
rather more pliable material towards the distal end. In that
way a desired, great difference in flexibility of the distal
end and the proximal end can be achieved.In order to be able to use the catheter according
to the invention with a metal guide wire or one coated with
polytetrafluorethylene, which obviously will have a very 
small diameter, the measure as characterised in claim 3 is
preferably employed. The friction between the guide wire and
the catheter will
