<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel continuous
polytetrafluoroethylene fiber having high density and
high strength.Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is well known for
its chemical inertness and for its excellent thermal and
dielectric properties which make it a desirable material
for use in a variety of applications, including many in
which it is preferred for use as a fiber, yarn, or other
filamentary form. Hereinafter, for convenience,
"fiber" may be used to describe filamentary forms in
general.Polytetrafluoroethylene fibers have been produced,
as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,655,853 (to Gallup),
by forming a mixture of viscose and
polytetrafluoroethylene particles in a dispersion,
extruding the mixture through a spinneret into an acidic
bath to form fibers consisting of a cellulosic matrix
containing the polytetrafluoroethylene particles.
After washing and rinsing, the fibers are heated to a
temperature of about 370°C to 390°C to decompose the
cellulosic material and to melt and coalesce the
polytetrafluoroethylene particles. The fibers are then
drawn at a ratio of about 4:1 to 35:1 at a temperature
between 370°C and 390°C. The fibers produced by this
relatively complex and expensive process have a tensile
strength generally less than 2 grams/denier, and may
require further processing steps, such as bleaching to
remove residual contaminants, which may lower the
tensile strength. An improved process is described in
U.S. Patent No. 4,064.214 (to Fitzgerald) in which the
fibers are further processed through a fibrillating
means, such as a high-velocity air jet. Yarns in the
100-2000 denier range having tensile strength in the
range 2-6 grams/denier are disclosed.Another method to produce polytetrafluoroethylene
fibers is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,953,566, 
3,962,153 and 4,064,214 (to Gore). In this method a
paste formed by mixing a lubricant, such as a mineral
spirit, with a fine powder of polytetrafluoroethylene
produced by coagulation of an aqueous dispersion of
polytetrafluoroethylene particles, is extruded and
formed by conventional means to produce a tape or bead.
The product thus formed, which may be slit to form
fibers, is dried to remove the lubricant and
subsequently stretched at a high rate, and at a
temperature lower than the crystalline melt point of
polytetrafluoroethylene, to produce a porous article.
The porous article may then be heated while maintained
in the stretched condition to a temperature above the
melt point of crystalline polytetrafluoroethylene,
generally considered to be
