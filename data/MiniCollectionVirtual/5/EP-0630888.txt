<ABSTRACT>
An imidazoline derivative represented by general formula (1), wherein R¹ represents a water- or fat-soluble 
substituent, in particular, carboxyl or carbomethoxy, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt group thereof. A process for 

producing the same. A blood pressure retentive containing as the active ingredient the above imidazoline derivative 
or another imidazoline derivative wherein R¹ in formula (1) represents hydrogen. The above imidazoline derivative is 

a novel substance, and both this compound and the imidazoline derivative wherein R¹ represents hydrogen are useful 
as the blood pressure retentive for treating hypotensive shock by removing excessive NO which is the substantial 

ingredient of a vascular smooth muscle relaxant (EDRF).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel imidazoline derivatives, a
method for producing the same and a highly safe therapeutic agent
for maintaining blood pressure having an imidazoline derivative as
the active ingredient and intended for maintaining blood pressure
of man for the treatment of shock by means of removing excess nitric
oxide (hereinafter referred to as "N0") which is the very substance
constituting the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (hereinafter
referred to as "EDRF"), which causes relaxation of the vascular
smooth muscles.In the past it was well known that the vascular endothelial cells
secrete a substance contributing to relaxation of the vascular
smooth muscles, i. e. EDRF. (Ref. Nature, Vol. 288, 373-376, 1980).
After a while it was substantiated that NO produced from L-arginine
is the very substance which constitutes EDRF. (Ref. Nature, Vol.
327, 524-526, 1987; and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sco., USA, Vol. 84, 9265-9259,
1987).There exist as N0-synthesizing enzymes (N0 synchase) produced by
the endothelial cells the following two kinds of enzymes: (1) the
endogenous type which is always present in the vascular endothelium
(Ref. Pharm. Rev., Vol. 43, 109-142, 1991; The Lancet, Vol. ii, 997-1000.
1989) and (2) the type which is derived from endotoxin or 
cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)(Ref. Pharm. Rev.,
Vol. 43, 109-142, 1991). While the former type (1) is thought to
contribute to physiological adjustment of the vascular resistance,
the abrupt progress of the synthesis of N0 due to the latter type
(2) is considered to cause the decline in the vascular resistance
and the accompanying fall in blood pressure, presumably causing
shock. Most of the patients in such syndrome do not respond to the
vasopressor such as norepinephrine and dopamine and fail to get
away from the mortal condition.Various therapies have been studied to cope with such shock as
described above caused by endotoxin or cytokines. One of those
therapeutic approaches ever experimented was intended to treat
laboratory animals in endotoxin shock or patients in septic shock,
using L-arginine analogue which is an N0 synthase inhibitor. (Ref.
The Lancet, Vol. 338, 1555-1557, 1991, and the Lancet, Vol. 338,
1557-1558, 1991). Since the increasing production of EDRF (namely,
N0) is the conclusive and universal phenomenon which occurs with
the fall in blood pressure of the patient in endotoxin shock, the
effort to decease the amount of N0 is an excellent therapeutic
approach to treat endotoxin shock or similar cases. The
