<ABSTRACT>
A higly efficient motor driver circuit of an electronic controller (56) for linear
cryogenic coolers operates directly from a variable power supply (58),

such as a battery. Elimination of the prior art voltage regulator ensures a
higher efficiency motor driver circuit (106) of the electronic controller.

Both open-loop and closed-loop controllers (112,110) electronically control
the motor driver circuit . The open-loop controller protects against

temperature sensor failure, and will limit maximum motor power as a function
of system ambient temperature. The closed-loop controller regulates

the temperature of the cold finger (66) accurately to a preset value, using
feedback from a temperature sensor (68) along with a novel pulse-width

modulation concept for modifying motor drive waveforms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally Linear Cryogenic Coolers, and more
specifically to Electronic Controllers for Linear Cryogenic Coolers.Linear Cryogenic Coolers are required to cool infrared detectors to the cryogenic
temperatures required for their proper operation. Infrared detectors are used in many
applications, such as night vision devices and heat-seeking weapons, in which infrared
detector temperature is a critical parameter.Linear Cryogenic Coolers commonly utilize a cooler motor to power a cooling
compressor. The cooling motor is typically controlled by cooler motor driver electronics
circuitry, which determines characteristics of the electrical power applied to the cooler
driver motor. These electrical characteristics are directly interrelated with cooling
system efficiency and performance, since the cooler motor drive waveform determines
the extent to which compressor piston displacement is controlled, and operational
control characteristics. An optimum linear cooling system must control piston
displacement as a function of detector temperature and other system variables, such as
pressure, temperature, dynamic system response with individual component transfer
functions changing during cool-down, and accuracy and loop dynamics required for
final temperature stabilization and maintenance. Previous cooler motor drivers use an adjustable voltage regulator to provide a
controlled supply voltage to the cooler motor driver electronics circuit. A temperature
feedback circuit is then used to control the set point of the adjustable voltage regulator,
thereby varying the power to the cooler motor. By varying the supply voltage, the
amplitude of the motor driver signal could be controlled as a function of temperature.
Such a cryogenic cooler control system is known from US 5,023,531
which forms the preamble part of claim 1.A block diagram of this type of prior art linear cryogenic cooling system is shown
in Figure 1. The Supply Voltage 12 applied to Voltage Regulator 14 can be either a
fixed or a variable DC voltage. Adjustable Voltage Regulator 14 produces Voltage
Regulator output signal 24, the magnitude of which is controlled by Temperature
Sensor Feedback signal 30. Voltage Regulator output signal 24 is applied to Motor
Driver 16, which is an electronic switching circuit which produces Motor Driver output
signal 26. A typical waveshape of Motor Driver output signal 26 is also shown in Figure
1. Motor Driver output signal 26 is applied to and controls Cooler Motor 18. Cooler
Motor 18 is used
