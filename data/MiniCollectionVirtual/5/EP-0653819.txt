<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (339) for electrically 
interconnecting circuits on electrical circuit boards 

(310,330) includes a pair of tubes (350) spaced apart to 
receive a daughter board (310) therebetween. Coil springs 

(340) in grooves (354) on adjacent tube surfaces provide a 
normal force against circuits on a film strip (320) covering 

the spring (340). Fluid is passed through the tubes (350) 
via pipes (364) to heat or cool the coil springs (340) which 

are made from a shaped memory metal alloy material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical 
connectors for interconnecting circuits of the type carried 
in printed circuit boards wherein such circuits are on close 
center-to-center spacings to provide high density electronic 
packaging. The trend in electronic packaging with respect to 
the interconnection of circuits has been one of constantly 
increasing density, reduced center-to-center spacing, and 
smaller components. Thus, center line spacing has dropped 
from 0.254 to 0.127 cm (0.200 to 0.050 inches) with current 
trends pushing toward less than 0.0254 cm (0.010 inches) for 
traces on printed circuit boards and contact pad centers on 
the order of less than 0.0508 cm (0.020 inches). With this 
trend, the difficulty of forming metal parts such as contact 
springs which provide sufficient forces of engagement of 
contacts to assure stable low resistance interfaces has led 
to difficulty in manufacture and assembly, difficulty in 
maintaining alignment of small parts and in mounting such 
parts in plastic housings. High density also leads to high 
cumulative contact forces which must be maintained to provide 
contact integrity. US-A-4 060 824 addresses the foregoing trends by the 
use of a flexible printed circuit film strip which has 
contact pads and an assembly, including housings which have 
grooves along the surfaces thereof facing the printed circuit 
boards to contain elongated coil springs which press 
the film strips and their contact pads against the contact 
pads on the printed circuit boards to provide an interconnection. With high density connectors of the type being 
discussed, where there are dozens, if not hundreds, of 
contact pads, circuit board insertion and extraction can be 
difficult with possible damage to the contacts or components 
carried on such boards.  Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a low force electrical connector for 
high density electrical interconnection applications which 
can be operated between two conditions, a low force 
engagement and a high force engagement. It is a further 
object to provide a low cost means effective to cause interconnections 
of contact pads on close centers by individual 
spring members responsive to temperature variations to 
effect forces for insertion, withdrawal, and mating contact. 
It is yet a further object to provide a novel interconnection 
medium capable of providing in one piece large numbers 
of individual force vectors along the linear length thereof 
which can be varied in response to
