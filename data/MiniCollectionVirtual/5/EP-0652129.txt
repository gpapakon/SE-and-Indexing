<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle having a tachograph in which graph 
charts are used for the visible presentation of journey and 

work-time data, a graph chart receiver which is provided 
with centring and entraining means and which is driven by 

a drive being provided for the mounting and real-time 
transportation of these graph charts and being arranged 

such that it is movable between a recording position within 
the tachograph and an insertion and removal position 

outside the tachograph, characterized
 
in that the tachograph (2) is constructed as a cuboid, flat 

built-in device in which the graph chart receiver is 
displaceably mounted as a drawer (19) and the front wall of 

the drawer (19) at least partially forms the front wall of 
the tachograph (2), provided on a narrow side of the built-in 

device,
 
in that, to secure the tachograph (2), a support (8) which 

is pivotable about an axis is provided on the vehicle, and 
in that the support (8) is arranged under the roof (3) of 

the driver's cab of the motor vehicle. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized
 
in that the support (8) is constructed as an integral part 

of a substructure (1) of the roof provided between the 
windscreen (4) and the roof (3) of the driver's cab of the 

motor vehicle. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 2, characterized
 
in that side walls (16) for mounting axle stubs are 

integrally formed on the substructure (1) of the roof on 
either side of a recess for the support (8), and
 
in that the support (8) has cheeks (13, 14) provided with 

bearings. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized
 
in that damping stops are associated with the support (8).  

 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized
 
in that a brake, for example a gas spring, is associated 

with the support (8). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized
 
in that locking means (10, 11) which are directly or 

indirectly in operative connection with the substructure 
(1) of the roof are provided on the support (8). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterized
 
in that the support (8) has substantially two outer walls 

which are at an angle to one another and correspond to the 

contours of the substructure (1) of the roof,
 
in that an intermediate base reinforced by cheeks (13, 14) 

is provided, and
 
in that a sheet-metal frame (15) serving to secure the 

tachograph (2) is connected to the intermediate base.
