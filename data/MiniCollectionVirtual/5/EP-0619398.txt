<ABSTRACT>
A steel cord (4) for reinforcing rubber articles and 
a pneumatic radial tire (10) having a belt layer (14) 

using the same, in which the steel cord comprises a 
crimped-curled core (2) made of a steel filament 

wave-shaped in a plane (crimped) and turned (curled) and 
5 - 8 sheath filaments (3) wound around the core in the 

same direction as the turn direction of the core. The 
wavelength λc of core-crimp is preferably defined as 

8dc≦ λc ≦ 30dc when the diameter of the core 
filament is dc, and the turn-number nc of the core 

around the center axis of the core per one wave-length 
of the core-crimp is preferably defined as 0.12 ≦nc≦ 

0.85 (turn/pitch). 
Since the core filament is three-dimensional, the 
core periphery in cross-section is lengthened and the 

rubber penetration property is remarkably enhanced so 
that the resistance to cut separation indicating tire 

durability is enhanced. The space between cords can be 
lengthened when the strength is constant and the 

resistance to BES is enhanced. Productivity is better 
than that of core crimped cord.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steel cord for 
reinforcing rubber articles such as pneumatic tires, 
industrial belts and the like, and more particularly to 
rubber articles and their steel cord having enhanced 
rubber penetration property, enhanced resistance to cut 
separation indicating tire durability, and good 
resistance to BES (belt edge separation). The 
invention also particularly relates to pneumatic radial 
tires using such steel cord. Products reinforced with steel cords are liable to 
suffer from corrosion of steel filament caused by water 
entering the products and thereby the durability and 
life of the products are lowered. For example, when steel cords used in a belt of a 
tire have a void and the tire tread is subjected to 
damage reaching the belt, water entering the belt 
spreads along the longitudinal direction of the cord 
through the voids in the steel cords. As a result, 
rust formed due to water also diffuses and the adhesion 
between rubber and steel cord is lowered at that 
portion. Finally, separation phenomena occur.  
 In order to prevent such corrosion propagation, 
there is proposed a cord structure in which rubber can 
sufficiently penetrate into the inside of the cord 
through gaps between adjacent metal filaments by 
pressured vulcanization. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 8208/1985 
and 1790/1984 disclose that one of the above-mentioned 
cord structures, so-called "1+5 structure" cord composed 
of one core filament and five sheath filaments, has gaps 
between sheath filaments and rubber can easily penetrate 
into the gaps, and further this cord can be produced by 
one-step twisting and thereby the productivity is high. Indeed the average sheath gaps are sufficient in 
such a cord structure, but deviation occurs in the 
arrangement of sheath filaments and there are formed 
attaching portions of the filaments resulting in forming 
of portions where rubber does not penetrate due to 
fluctuation in the manufacturing procedure. Attention is also drawn to the disclosures of US-A-5351470 and EP-A-551124. Objects of the present invention are to provide a 
steel cord having remarkably enhanced rubber penetration 
property by changing the structure of a core filament 
and good resistance to BES, and to provide a pneumatic 
radial tire using the same.  
 The present inventor has made intensive researches 
and studies so as to overcome the above-mentioned 
problems and found that it is possible to enhance the 
rubber penetration property and the resistance to cut
