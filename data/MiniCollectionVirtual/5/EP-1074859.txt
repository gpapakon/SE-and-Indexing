<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an anti-reflective
material with good the stainproofing properties,wherein dust

and fingerprints do not readily adhere to the surface and can
be easily wiped off when adhered, the anti-reflective material

being provided with a stainproofing layer having excellent
durability of its stainproofing effect. In an anti-reflective

material comprising a transparent substrate and a low-refractive
index layer and a stainproofing layer laminated in

order on the transparent substrate, the low-refractive index
layer is a silica film formed by the sol-gel method, and the

stainproofing layer contains at least a perfluoroalkyl ether
compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-reflective
material having particularly excellent display
stainproofing properties, durability and anti-reflective
properties, which is suited for use in displays such as
CRTs, LCDs, and PDPs.With the recent development of displays such as CRTs,
LCDs, and PDPs, various types of equipment incorporating
these displays are used in various fields. When using such
equipment in places exposed to comparatively bright light
such as outdoors, problems such as reflections from
external light such as sunlight and light from fluorescent
lamps in the display have increased. Therefore, it is
strongly required to prevent the reflection of external
light on display surfaces, that is, to prevent reflection.Therefore, display surface are frequently provided
with anti-reflective films to improve their visibility.
Such anti-reflective films are generally formed by
providing the surface with a material having a refractive
index lower than that of a lower layer in an optical film 
thickness which is n/4 times (wherein n is an odd number)
as large as the wavelength of the light of interest. As
the method of forming this outermost layer, for example,
there can be used a method of forming the layer by
deposition or sputtering of materials such as magnesium
fluoride and silica, a method of coating a coating
solution prepared by dispersing these materials, and a
method of forming a fluorine-based polymer film by
deposition and coating.However, the anti-reflective film according to the
above prior art has the problems that adhesion of dust or
oily substances in the atmosphere to the surface of the
substrate or adhesion of fingerprints is liable to quickly
show as soiling. For example, stains on the surface of
transparent glass or plastic impairs the appearance of
display window glass, impairs the field of view in case of
eyeglasses, and prevents safe driving in case of vehicle
windows. Furthermore, for optical instruments such as
cameras, stains impair their performance. Therefore, there
has been demand for an anti-reflective film to which
stains do not readily adhere, and from which stains can be
easily removed once they adhere.To prevent stains, various methods have hitherto been
suggested. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Application, First Publication No. Sho 58-142958, Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho
58-147483, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application,
