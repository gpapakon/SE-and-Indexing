<DESCRIPTION>
The United States Government may have certain rights
to this invention pursuant to research contract USDA No.
6146-01.The present invention relates to the cloning of the
gene expressing antigens of Actinobacillus
pleuropneumonia (A. pleuropneumoniae). It further
relates to a method of producing these antigens and the
use of the antigens to vaccinate pigs against porcine
pleuropneumonia.Haemophilus pleuropneumonia of swine is a highly
contagious respiratory disease caused by the gram-negative
bacterium, A. pleuropneumoniae. In recent
years, partly because of the trend toward confinement and
intensified production, there has been a significant
increase in the incidence of the disease and it is now a
major cause of economic loss to the swine industry.
During outbreaks of the acute disease the mortality rate
can reach 100% among piglets and 25% among feeder pigs.
Infected pigs may develop acute local extensive pneumonia
accompanied by a fibrinous pleuritis or chronic localized
pulmonary necrosis with pleuritic adhesions. Eight
serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae have been identified
but serotype 5 is by far the most prevalent.It appears that one of the virulence factors of
A. pleuropneumoniae is a secreted cytotoxin. This is
supported by the fact cell-culture supernatants from
A. pleuropneumoniae have been shown to be cytotoxic for
porcine alveolar macrophages and peripheral monocytes 
(Bendixin et al., Infect. Immun. 33, 673-676 (1981)).
Additionally, sonicated bacteria and sterile culture
supernatants have been reported to induce localized
pneumonia which is similar to pneumonia observed in
naturally infected pigs (Rosendal et al., Proc. Int. Pig.
Vet. Soc. Congr. 5:221 (1980)).It is believed that the A. pleuropneumoniae
cytotoxin is an extracellular hemolysin/s produced by
most if not all A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes. The
nature of the hemolysin/s is poorly understood. It has
been reported that the various serotypes of
A. pleuropneumoniae produce either heat-stable
carbohydrates (Kume et al., Infect. Immun. 51, 563-570
(1986)) or heat labile proteins (Maudsely et al., Can. J.
Microbiol. 32, 801-805 (1986)). It has also been
reported that the hemolysins of A. pleuropneumoniae
serotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 require RNA (Martin et
al., Can. J. Microbiol. 31, 456-462 (1985)). To date,
only two hemolysins have been characterized, a heat
stable hemolysin from serotype 2 (Kume et al., Infect.
Immun. 51, 563-570 (1986)) and a 105 kD polypeptide
secreted by serotype 1 (Frey et al., Infect. Immun. 56,
2570-2575
