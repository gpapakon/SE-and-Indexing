<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide device formed out of a material the refractive 
index of which has anisotropy, and an optical instrument using 

the same device. The device comprises an electrooptic single-crystal 
substrate on which are formed a first core portion the refractive 

index of which is higher than that of the substrate with respect to 
both ordinary and extraordinary rays of light, and a second core portion 

the refractive index of which is higher than that of the substrate 
with respect to extraordinary rays of light only. The overlapping region 

of the first and second core portions constitutes a double mode 
waveguide for extraordinary rays of light. This optical waveguide device 

is used in place of a pinhole element in an optical system in a 
confocal scanning optical microscope so as to guide illuminating 

light into an object to be detected, and to guide the reflected light 
from the object into a detector. This microscope is provided with a 

polarization conversion element for use in setting the polarization direction 
of illuminating light different from that of reflected light. The 

optical waveguide device functions as a single-mode waveguide with 
respect to illuminating light, and as a double mode waveguide with 

respect to reflected light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical waveguide 
device and an optical instrument using the same. Recently, the optical waveguide device has attracted 
notice in the field of various optical instruments, 
particularly optical measuring instruments for obtaining 
information relating to the phase and amplitude of the 
surface of an object to be detected. The reason resides in 
its advantage taht the use of an optical waveguide has the 
effect of reducing the size and weight of an optical system 
and eliminating the need to adjust the optical axis. Depending on the difference in refractive index between 
the light guide core and the cladding forming the optical 
waveguide, the waveguide width, the refractive index 
distribution, etc., the various optical waveguides are 
divided into the following classes, that is, the single-moded 
waveguides in which only the 0-order moded beam is excited, 
the double-moded waveguides in which the 0-order and first-order 
moded beams are excited and the multi-moded waveguides 
in which at least three beams of the 0-order, first-order and 
second-order modes or over are excited. For instance, a confocal laser scanning microscope in  
 
which mode interference in a double-moded waveguide is 
utilized to obtain a differential interference image of the 
surface of an object to be detected, is disclosed in the 
paper by H. Ooki et al; "A novel type of laser scanning 
microscope: theoretical considerations" Optics 
Communications, vol. 85, No. 2, 3; Sep. 1991, pp 177-182. With the optical instrument described in this paper, 
when a laser beam is incident to the double-moded waveguide, 
a 0-order moded beam and a first-order moded beam are excited 
in accordance with the amplitude distribution of the incident 
laser beam. The two moded beams interfer with each other in 
the waveguide thus causing the light intensity distribution 
in the waveguide to become asymmetrical. By preliminarily 
choosing the length of the double-moded waveguide to be 
optimum and putting forth two branch waveguides from one end 
of the double-moded waveguide, information relating to the 
asymmetry of the light intensity distribution in the 
double-moded waveguide can be obtained by detecting the 
difference in intensity between the light beams emitted from 
the branched two branch waveguides. It is considered that 
the asymmetry of the light intensity distribution in the 
waveguide is due, on one hand, to the asymmetry of the 
intensity distribution of the incident laser beam and, on the 
other
