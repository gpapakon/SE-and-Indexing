<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to image reading and/or forming
apparatuses having a document transport mechanism, and
more particularly to an image reading and/or forming apparatus having a document
transport mechanism
and suited for reducing
space occupied thereby in an office or room.Recently, it has become possible to process a
large amount of data at a high speed due to the
improved performance of central processing units
(CPUs). As a result, the image processing techniques
have rapidly improved, and image reading apparatuses
for business use and personal use have rapidly become
popular due to this progress.However, the office space or room space in
general is limited, and the space restrictions are
strict particularly at the central parts of the city.
For this reason, the large operation space required by
the image reading apparatus and the image forming
apparatus has become a problem, and it is desirable to
make improvements from the point of view of the space
utilization efficiency.Conventionally, there are image reading
apparatuses of an automatic document feed (ADF) type, a
flat bed type, and a composite type which is a
combination of the ADF type and the flat bed type.FIG.1 shows a flat bed type image reading
apparatus which is presently used popularly as an
apparatus for personal use. According to this flat bed
type image reading apparatus, a document is placed on a
document glass 72, and the document is covered by a 
document holding cover 71. When a switch which is not
shown is turned ON, a read head (carrier) 73 moves back
and forth to successively read the image of the
document on the document glass 72.According to this apparatus, the operation
region only exists at the top and the office space can
be used with relatively good efficiency. However, the
operation efficiency is poor because the document must
be set one document at a time. In addition, it is
necessary to set the document and operate the apparatus
for each document, and the operation region at the
front must be open.FIG.2 shows a composite type image reading
apparatus which is a combination of the ADF type and
the flat bed type. This composite type apparatus is
popularly used in general. According to this
apparatus, when the documents are stacked on a hopper
part 74, the document is transported by a transport
part 76 and is read by an image reader part 73. The
read documents are ejected to a stacker part 75 and
successively stacked.According to this apparatus, a plurality of
documents are automatically and
