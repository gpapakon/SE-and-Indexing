<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for maintaining ski tracks and for attachment to a towing vehicle has a supporting frame swinging to and fro about a longitudinal axis lying in the travelling direction. Connected to the supporting frame via self-aligning bearings are at least two milling frames which are each equipped with milling tools and behind which is arranged a smoothing device which extends at least over the working width of the milling tools. In order to be able to work the ski tracks evenly irrespective of descending or ascending travel, there are located at the tail side on each milling frame in each case two tail bearings for the smoothing device which, together with the self-aligning bearings, next to one another form two 3-point bearings for the smoothing device.
