<ABSTRACT>
A wobbling body in the form of an oloidic hollow body (7) which serves as a receptacle for material to be mixed rests on two free-running conveyor belts (8). Looped around the hollow body (7) and attached to it is a band (10) delimited by two raised edges (9). Positively engaging in the band (10) is a drive element (not pictured) in the form of an endless belt. The raised edges (9) dip down between the conveyor belts in the area of a guide and drive unit (11) in which the means for guiding the raised edges (9) and driving the drive elements are arranged and collected. The conveyor belts (8) run on low-friction tables (12) which are supported by a frame (14), to which the guide and drive unit (11) is also attached. The frame rests on a foundation (15). In its rolling on the conveyor belts (8) the hollow body describes a wobbling movement, during which the raised edges dip down furthest in the area of the guide and drive unit (11), and the tangents to the raised edges (9) at this deepest point always lie in the direction of movement of the conveyor belts (8).
