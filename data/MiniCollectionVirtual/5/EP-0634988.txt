<ABSTRACT>
Method for increasing the distance between two faces, inserting into a space between the two faces a diaphragm power jack, the shape of which being adapted to the shape of the space, the diaphragm power jack comprising two abutting sheets being sealingly bonded along the entire circumference, a pipe penetrating the bonded, injecting a pressurized fluid through the pipe to the interface between the two sheets thereby forcing the sheets apart whereby substantially all the energy from the pressurized fluid being converted to forces perpendicularly to the sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Present invention is related to a diaphragm power
jack and a method of utilizing same.In numerous situations within many fields efforts have
been made to increase a distance between two parts in a quick and
efficient way. Such a situation occurs when two flanges which
have been clamped together, are to be loosened. In such case one
of the flanges should be moved away from the other or even both
flanges should be axially displaced.In many other cases the aim is to remove or displace
only one of the parts between which a gap exists. This is the
case by partitioning a subject into smaller parts which is the
case in stone quarries, when removing a concrete outer layer from
a pipe, etc. US-A-3 822 861 discloses an inflatable bladder made from a
flexible, elastomeric material to be used for removing the
mold from cast concrete. In the inflated condition the width
of the bladder is substantially increased compared to the initial
width. A low pressure pneumatic system is used, and the
bladder is used repeatedly. This device cannot be used for
creating strong forces, such as for removal of concrete layers
from a concrete-covered pipe or for splitting of stones and
rocks. The need for a small and effective tool to provide a
very strong force in a selected direction, substantially without
loss of energy in other directions will increase productivity and
the accuracy of the performance substantially.In connection with repairs of pipelines of the above
mentioned type a considerable amount of time is used for removing
the outer concrete layer to give accessibility to the pipe itself
for repairs maintenance or modifications. It is in fact known to
cut tracks in the concrete around the exterior circumference and
likewise longitudinal cuts whereby hydraulic tools are used to
press the sections apart in a tangential direction, resulting in
braking the concrete out in small pieces.The forces from the tool may be released between
parallel flat or cylindric sheets. The forces will be directed
perpendicularly to the plane of the flat sheets or perpendicularly
or radially to the cylindric plane of cylindric sheets. In the
latter case the direction is radially inwardly from a stronger
outer cylinder or radially outwardly from a stronger inner
cylinder, of which the first case will be a clamping operation.Repair of pipelines on difficult accessible places,
such as at the sea bed, is time consuming and in many ways very
difficult if repair work is to be made by welding. A ruptured
pipeline usually is cut and a new portion

<CLAIMS>
A method for generating a strong expanding force between
adjacent faces of a material to be pressed apart, wherein a

diskshaped expanding means, which may be activated by the supply
of a pressure medium, is placed in a slot between said faces and

is activated to affect the faces with a strong separating force,

characterized
 in that a slot-forming groove is formed in the
material in question, and that, in the groove, there is placed

an expanding means which is dimensioned and shaped so that, in
the inactive condition, it fills up the space between the side

walls of the groove, the means consisting of a pair of steel
plates (1, 2), having immediately adjacent

side surfaces and being sealingly joined along their peripheral
edge to form a closed cavity having a large area and minimum

volume, a connecting tube (3) for pressure medium extending
through the peripheral edge and into the cavity, and that a

hydraulic pressure medium is supplied to the cavity through said
tube, so that the material is pressed apart by the strong

expanding force produced at the initial oppositely directed
movement of the metal plates.
A method according to claim 1, for removal of a concrete
layer from a concrete-covered pipe, 
characterized
 in that a
circumferential groove (10) is formed in the concrete at a

distance from a free end of the concrete layer, and at least two
axial grooves (6) are formed in the concrete section from the

circumferential groove to said end, and that the expanding means
is placed in the circumferential groove and pressure medium is

supplied to the cavity of the expanding means, so that, between
the concrete section (8) and the pipe (9), there are generated

axial shearing forces causing the concrete section to loosen from
the pipe.
A method according to claim 1, for splitting of a hard
material, especially stone or rock, 
characterized
 in that a
segment-shaped groove is formed in the material by means of an

angle grinder or the like, and that the expanding means (11) is
placed in said groove and pressure medium is supplied to the

cavity of the expanding means so that the generated expanding 
force causes the material to rupture and split up.
A device for generating a strong expanding force between
adjacent side faces of a groove in a material to be pressed

apart, and comprising an expanding means consisting of a pair of
flat, planar side members (1, 2) which are sealingly joined along

their peripheral edges to form a closed cavity, and a connecting
tube (3) extending through a peripheral edge and into the cavity,

for supply of a pressure medium to the cavity, for activation of
the expanding means, 
characterized
 in that the side members
consist of a pair of steel plates (1, 2) which are located

closely adjacent to each other so as to define a cavity having
a large area and minimum volume, and further are shaped and

dimensioned so as to closely fill up the space between the side
faces of said groove in the inactive as well as in the active

condition of the expanding means, and that the pressure medium
is a hydraulic medium.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the
plates (1, 2) are circular-arc shaped, the connecting tube (3)

extending through the convexly curved peripheral edge of the
plates.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the
plates (1, 2) have the shape of a segment of a circle, the

connecting tube (3) extending through the rectilinear peripheral
edge.
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the
plates (1, 2) are formed as a cylinder wherein the plates are

coaxial and are sealingly joined along their respective end
edges, the connecting tube (3) extending through one end edge in

the axial direction of the cylinders.
