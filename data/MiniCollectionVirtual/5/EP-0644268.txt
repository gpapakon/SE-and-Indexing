<ABSTRACT>
A binary assay identifies agents that inhibit sterol 
Δ14 reductase involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. In 

the primary screen, sterol Δ14 reductase inhibition by a 
test sample is assayed by adding the test sample to a culture 

of 
Neurospora crassa
 having an erg-3 mutation and 
also to a culture of a strain having an erg-1 mutation, 

comparing the extent of growth inhibition after incubation 
in the two cultures, and identifying as positives those 

samples that show growth inhibition in the erg-3 culture 
exceeding that in the erg-1 culture. In the secondary 

screen, samples that test positive in the primary screen 
are reassayed by adding the test sample to a culture of a 


Saccharomyces cerevisiae
 strain into which has been introduced 
multiple copies of a gene encoding sterol Δ14 reductase 

and also to a strain of 
S. cerevisiae
 that does not 
have the introduced gene; positive samples are identified 

after incubation by observation that growth inhibition in 
the culture having no introduced reductase gene exceeds 

growth inhibition in the culture having the introduced 
reductase gene. In preferred embodiments, a known inhibitor 

of sterol Δ14 reductase is employed in solidified 
media in both the primary and the secondary screens, 

resulting in an assay that is highly sensitive and specific 
for the detection of sterol Δ14 reductase inhibitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screening method for the
identification of agents that inhibit the sterol Δ14
reductase enzyme of sterol biosynthesis.Sterols are steroid alcohols of vegetable and animal
origin. Ergosterol is the principal membrane sterol of
fungi. It is structurally similar to its animal counterpart,
cholesterol, and its higher plant counterparts,
stigmasterol and sitosterol. Though the biosynthesis of
ergosterol in fungi involves steps distinct from the other
sterols, the pathways in different organisms share several
common steps. The lanosterol 14α-demethylation steps in
cholesterol and ergosterol formation in animals and fungi,
as well as the obtusifoliol 14α-demethylation in stigmasterol
and sitosterol biosynthesis in plants, both lead to
the formation of a double bond between carbons 14 and 15
of the sterol ring. This double bond is then reduced by
sterol Δ14 reductase activity. The enzyme is located in
the microsomal fraction in pig liver, yeast and Zea mays,
and requires NADPH as an electron donor (Marcireau, C., et
al., Curr. Genet. 22: 267-272 (1992)).Genetic studies of ergosterol biosynthesis mainly
have been carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Paltauf,
F., et al., in Jones E.W., et al., eds., The Molecular
and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, GeneExpression, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1992,
pages 434-437). In yeast, ergosterol affects membrane
fluidity and permeability and plays an essential role in
the yeast cell cycle. Mutations in the biosynthetic
pathway are generally recovered by selecting for resistance
to polyene antibiotics. Polyenes bind to ergosterol
in the plasma membrane and produce pores through which
ions can flow leading to cell death. Mutants with lower
levels of plasma membrane ergosterol bind less polyene and
show increased resistance. This method has permitted the
recovery of mutations in many of the genes in the pathway.A series of polyene-resistant mutants of Neurospora
crassa were isolated several years ago, although little
work was done at that time to characterize the mutations
on a molecular level. Recently, Grindle and co-workers
characterized one of these Neurospora crassa mutants,
denoted erg-3, and found that it carried a genetic lesion
in sterol Δ14 reductase activity (Ellis, S.W., et al., J.
Gen. Micro. 137: 267-272 (1992)). The sterol Δ14 reductase
gene in S. cerevisiae, denoted ERG24, also has recently
been cloned and sequenced (Lorenz, T., and Parks,
L.W., DNA and Cell Biol. 11: 685-692 (1992)).Toward the end of the
