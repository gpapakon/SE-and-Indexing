<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system comprises base stations (2) each 
having sector antennas (208-213) and an omnidirectional antenna 

(215) for receiving up-going interference waves on all 
communication channels previously allocated thereto to detect power 

levels of those interference waves. The power levels of up-going 
interference waves on all communication channels are monitored at 

all times by using the omnidirectional antenna (215). When a 
calling signal from a mobile station (3) is received by a certain 

sector antenna, respective up-going C/I ratios are calculated on 
the channels not yet used among communication channels previously 

allocated to that sector. Among channels where the calculated 
up-going C/I ratios satisfy a predetermined quality reference, a 

channel to be allocated to the mobile station is determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system
including a sector cell arrangement, and more particularly to a
mobile communication system which allocates communication channels
with use of a carrier wave/interference wave power ratio
(hereinafter, referred to as a C/I ratio), and a base station for
use in such a system.Referring to FIG.1, a sector cell arrangement in a conventional
mobile communication system is illustrated in an exemplified
manner. Sector antennas provided in base stations 11, 12 form
sectors A1, B1, C1 and A2, B2, B2, respectively. A situation will be
described wherein a mobile station 14 moving in the sector C2 sends
a call to the base station 12 which hereby allocates the same
channel as a communication channel allocated by the base station 11
communicating with a mobile station 13 moving in the sector C1
through the allocated channel.Since the same channel is used, the mobile station 14 receives
not only a down-going carrier wave from the base station 12 but also
a down-going interference wave 15 from the base station 11 while the 
base station 12 receives not only an up-going carrier wave from the
base station 14 but also an up-going interference wave 16 from the
mobile station 13 under communication with the base station 11. It
is herein assumed that "up-going" denotes a direction from any
mobile station to any base station while "down-going" denotes a
direction from any base station to any mobile station.In mobile communication systems, the following two systems have
generally been proposed for allocation of dynamic channels.In the first system, up-going interference wave power and
up-going carrier wave power are measured for each sector channel to
calculate an up-going C/I ratio. Further, there is selected an
optimum one of channels having the up-going C/I ratios exceeding a
predetermined threshold (or a quality reference), taking the
channel conditions of surrounding base stations into consideration,
and the selected channel is in turn allocated to an originating
call.In the second system, an up-going C/I ratio is similarly
estimated and a mobile station is informed of a communication
channel where the up-going C/I ratio exceeds a quality reference as
a candidate channel. The mobile station measures a down-going
interference wave and a down-going carrier wave on the informed
candidate channel, and the measured result is sent back to the base
station which estimates a down-going C/I ratio and allocates to the
originating call a channel where the estimated
