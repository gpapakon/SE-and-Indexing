<ABSTRACT>
A darts target consists of a framework having spokes (1) and hoops which bound a large number of areas between them in which areas in each case one spring-loaded segment (4) is guided such that it is axially displaceable, and of a contact plate having contacts to indicate hits in each segment (4). At least one pin (11) is assigned to each segment (4) in order to make contact with the contact plate in the event of a hit. In order to improve such a darts target, moving slides are provided which are guided displaceably on the spokes (1) and/or hoops, engaging behind them in a U-shape. Pins (46) which are preferably pressed into the slides are connected to said slides. The pins (46) pass through guide grooves (47, 48) in the spokes (1) and/or hoops and the side walls of the segments (4). The guide grooves (47, 48) in the spokes (1) and/or hoops on the one hand and the segments (4) on the other hand run oppositely in an L-shape, so that the pins (46) of the slides can be inserted into the guide grooves (47) of the spokes (1) and/or hoops and can be latched to the guide grooves (48) of the segments (4).

Target for darts comprising

a frame with spokes (1) and bands between which are located a number of
fields in each of which is located a spring-loaded segment (4) capable of axial

movement,
and a contact plate with contacts for the display of points scored in each
segment (4),
with at least one pin allocated to each segment (4) for making contact with the
contact plate in the event of a scoring hit,
characterised by
sliding elements (45) which are located at the spokes (1) and/or bands such that
they engage behind these in a U arrangement,
further pins (46) connected to these sliding elements (45), and preferably pressfitted
in these, which engage through the guide slots (47, 48) of the spokes (1)

and/or bands and the side walls (25) of the segments (4),
said guide slots (47, 48) of the spokes (1) and/or bands on the one hand, and
segments (4) on the other hand, running in an opposed L arrangement so that

the pins (46) of the sliding elements (45) are inserted in the guide slots (47) of
the spokes (1) ) and/or bands, and can be latched with the guide slots (48) of the

segments (4).
