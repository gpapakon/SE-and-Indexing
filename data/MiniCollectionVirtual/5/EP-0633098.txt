<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing aerosol from a substance 
includes a heat exchanger (10) for receiving and cooling a 

substance. The heat exchanger (10) includes a housing (30); a 
cryogenic reservoir (25) comprising a solid material mounted 

within the housing (30); temperature control means (31-34,80,75,77) for 
controllably cooling the reservoir; and energy exchange 

means (45) for allowing thermal contact between the reservoir (25) 
and the substance for effectuating transfer of cooling 

energy from the cryogenic reservoir (25) to the substance for 
controllably cooling the substance. A delivery line (120) has an 

inlet (50) for receiving the substance from the heat exchanger (10) 
at a first pressure. A nozzle (102) is connected to the delivery 

line (120) for receiving the substance from the delivery line (120). 
The nozzle (102) has at least one exit opening (165) which allows 

passing of the substance therethrough for expanding the 
substance from the first pressure to a second pressure 

which is lower than the first pressure for solidifying the 
substance and producing aerosol. Condensation preventing 

means is provided for preventing condensation from forming 
on the delivery line and/or on the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to production
of cryogenic aerosol and, more particularly, to surface
cleaning using a cryogenic aerosol.Surface contamination is a widespread concern in many
industries. Such contamination can result in production of
inferior or non-operating products, or considerably lower
product yields. For instance, as a specific example,
surface contamination is a prevalent problem in the
microelectronics processing industry, and can take the form
of unwanted particles, films, molecules, or the like; and
the surfaces that can be contaminated include those of
semiconductor wafers, displays, microelectronic components,
etc. Contamination of these surfaces can cause various
types of defects to develop, including short circuits, open
circuits, stacking faults, among others. These defects can
adversely affect circuits, and ultimately cause entire
chips to fail. Another type of surface that has
contaminants that are required to be removed are the walls
of tool or processing chambers, such as plasma etch and
chemical vapor deposition reactors. Reaction residues
and/or polymers generated during semiconductor processing
tend to deposit on the chamber walls. These residues
and/or polymers can subsequently flake off onto products
being processed or onto subsequently processed products.
In order to prevent yield loss due to this mechanism,
manufacturing processing chambers have to be disassembled
periodically to be cleaned or "wiped down". Current
practice involves weekly disassembly of the fixtures inside
the chamber and wipe down of all the surfaces with a
mixture of alcohol and water. This periodic machine
disassembly, wipe down, and re-assembly, and the required 
long pump-down times after cleaning for surface drying,
severely reduces the production and reliability of the
processing equipment. In addition, the acidic fumes formed
when the deposited material reacts with water often creates
a health hazard for cleaning personnel.U.S. Patent No. 5,108,512, issued April 28, 1992, to
Goffnett et al., relates to cleaning a chemical vapor
deposition reactor used in the production of
polycrystalline silicon by impacting with carbon dioxide
pellets. Goffnett et al. discloses delivering carbon
dioxide gas to a pelletizer where the gas is compressed and
formed into solid carbon dioxide pellets. The pellets,
along with an accelerant gas for increasing the velocity of
the pellets, are delivered to a nozzle. The nozzle is a
"venturi" nozzle which maximizes the velocity at which the
pellets are
