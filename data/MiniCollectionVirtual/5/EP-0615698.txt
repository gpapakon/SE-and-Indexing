<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cigarette paper tube with filter tip for producing home-made cigarettes and is characterised in that at least one coaxial filter is provided in the paper tube (2) and consists of an external tubular cylindrical filter (10) and a coaxially displaceable filter core (10') arranged therein which projects out of the filter ring towards the middle section of the cigarette paper tube, the coaxial filter either a) being designed as a displaceable coaxial filter and having its outer diameter adapted to that of the paper tube in the manner such that, in relation to the filter plug of the filter tip, it bears in a sealing manner as a further filter plug on the inner surface of the paper tube but is displaceable therein by gentle pressure when the paper tube is filled with a tobacco portion, or b) it is designed as a coaxial filter which is fixed to the filter tip and, at the outer surface of the filter ring, is connected to the inner surface of the paper tube at the mouth end thereof.
