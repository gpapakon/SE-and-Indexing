<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
thermoplastic resin composition and a thermoplastic resin
laminate, each having an excellent mat property.
Further, the present invention relates to a
method for matting thermoplastic
resins.The term "acrylic resin" as used hereinafter is
intended to have the meaning of both acrylic resin and
methacrylic resin.Molded products of a thermoplastic resin such
as an acrylic resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, and ABS
resin generally have gloss or luster which has been
understood to be an important characteristic for certain
applications. On the other hand, there are many
applications in which the gloss is not required, or
glossless or mat products are preferred.Conventional methods for matting a
thermoplastic resin are divided roughly into method (1)
in which an embossing or mat finish is applied, and
method (2) in which an inorganic or organic matting agent
is added. Method (1) is inferior in productivity and
processing expense, and insufficient in the mat effect;
thus this method is unsuitable in many instances for the
applications where a fabrication of a resin is required
to be conducted, while it is advantageous in that the
deterioration in the physical properties of the resin is
generally small. In contrast, method (2) involves a big
problem of deteriorating the physical properties, while 
it is advantageous in that the decrease in productivity
is small, the extent of the mat finish can be controlled,
and this method can be used even for applications where
fabrication is conducted. In particular, when an
inorganic material such as a silica gel is used as a
matting agent, the resin will deteriorate considerably in
impact resistance, tensile strength and elongation.On the other hand, another method is disclosed
in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-36535 in
which an organic material, particularly, a high polymeric
matting agent is used. Specifically, a cross-linked
polymer prepared by a suspension polymerization and
having an average particle diameter of 35 to 500 µm is
used in this publication. However, the method using the
high polymeric matting agent mentioned above produced
insufficient matting effect while the deterioration of
impact resistance, and tensile strength and elongation
was small.

blend of a thermoplastic resin being a chlorinated polyolefin having a chlorine
content of 15 - 45 wt%, with polymers of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid
