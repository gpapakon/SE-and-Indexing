<ABSTRACT>
A spatial vol. between the outer sleeve (1.1) and the tank (2.1) is filled with a granular type insulation material taking up the entire available space. The outer sleeve is formed by portable insulation plates. Several pref. cylindrical tanks are provided, which are accommodated in a common essentially blocked shaped outer sleeve. The block shaped outer sleeve gives an arrangement minimising radiation.
