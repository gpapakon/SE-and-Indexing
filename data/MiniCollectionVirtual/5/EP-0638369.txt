<ABSTRACT>
In a machine for inspecting bottles, with a first rectilinear conveyor which transports the bottles with a bottom support and with a downstream second rectilinear conveyor which transports the bottles without a bottom support, there are arranged on the first rectilinear conveyor a monitoring device for foreign bottles and a lead-out device for the detected foreign bottles which device can be controlled by the monitoring device. This prevents foreign bottles from advancing to the second rectilinear conveyor and causing damage there, for example to a bottom-inspecting device.

<CLAIMS>
An inspection machine for bottles or the like, having a first linear conveyor (1) which
conveys the bottles supported at their bottoms in a row one behind another, having a

directly following second linear conveyor (2) which conveys the bottles, without support

at their bottoms, in a row one behind another through a bottom inspection device (22,
23), and having a wall inspection device (10), characterised in that the first linear

conveyor (1) conveys the bottles through the wall inspection device (10), that a
monitoring device (5) for extraneous bottles, which is at least in part integrated in the

wall inspection device (10), is disposed on the first linear conveyor (1), and that an
ejection device (6) which can be controlled by the monitoring device (5) is disposed

between the wall inspection device (10) and the second linear conveyor (2), which
ejection device removes only recognised extraneous bottles laterally from the first linear

conveyor (1) before they reach the second linear conveyor (2).
An inspection machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the first linear
conveyor (1) has at least one conveyor belt (7) which can be driven and which acts on

the bottle bottom.
An inspection machine according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the second linear
conveyor (2) has at least one belt (8) which can be driven and which acts on the bottle

circumference or bottle top.
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
two linear conveyors (1, 2) are disposed in alignment, so that the bottles are

continuously conveyed linearly. 
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
initial region of the second linear conveyor (2) overlaps the end region of the first linear

conveyor (1).
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a
feeder device (9) which provides a spacing between the bottles is disposed on or in front

of the first linear conveyor (1), in front of the monitoring device (5).
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the
monitoring device (5) comprises at least one height sensor.
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
monitoring device (5) comprises at least one colour sensor (20).
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
monitoring device (5) comprises at least one illuminating device (11) and at least one

electronic camera (12).
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the
ejection device (5) comprises at least one pusher (13) which is mounted near the first

linear conveyor (1) and which can move into the path of movement of the bottles.
An inspection machine according to claim 10, characterised in that the opposite side of
the first linear conveyor (1) to the pusher (13) is open at the side or is free from bottle

guide elements (18).
An inspection machine according to claims 10 or 11, characterised in that a collection
vessel (14) for ejected extraneous bottles is disposed on the opposite side of the first

linear conveyor (1) to the pusher (13). 
An inspection machine according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that a
third linear conveyor (16) is disposed downstream of the second linear conveyor (2),

and an ejection device (24) for soiled bottles which are identified in the bottom
inspection device (22, 23) and in the wall inspection device (10) is disposed on said third

linear conveyor.
An inspection machine according to claim 13, characterised in that a mouth- and/or
screw thread inspection device (4) is disposed on the second linear conveyor (2) and a

second ejection device (25) for bottles which are identified in the mouth- and/or screw
thread inspection device (4) as being damaged is disposed on the third linear conveyor

(16).
