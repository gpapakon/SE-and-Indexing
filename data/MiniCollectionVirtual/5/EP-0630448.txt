<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic dashpot has a cylinder housing (1), a piston (3), means for regulating the outflow of oil from the oil and piston chamber (2), so as to attenuate the kinetic energy applied on the piston, an oil return valve and an elastic force (22) which presses the piston (3) back into its initial position. A spiral damping groove (35) which extends in the axial direction is arranged on the skirt (34) of the piston (3). An endless, coaxial oil draining groove (6) which is completely covered by the piston (3) in the initial position of the piston (3) is arranged on the inner area (4) of the envelope of the oil and piston chamber (2, 2.2).

oil and piston chamber (2) under the effect of a spring force (22) and 
which is provided at the piston casing (34) with an axially extending 

spindle-shaped damping groove (35), which opens into an annular oil 
outflow groove (6), which is provided at the inward casing surface (4) 

of the oil and piston chamber (2) and by way of which the oil, which on 
a loading of the piston (3) is pressed through the damping groove (35), 

flows away by way of an oil outflow channel into an oil reservoir and 
which, on a return movement of the piston (3) caused by spring force, is 

conducted back by way of an oil return flow valve into the oil and 
piston chamber (2), characterised thereby, that a second equally long 

oil and piston chamber (2.2) is arranged axially behind the oil and 
piston chamber (2), that at least one axially extending oil outflow 

groove (5) is provided at the inward casing surface (4) of the second 
oil and piston chamber (2.2) and immediately adjacent the piston (3) 

and opens on the one piston chamber side into the oil outflow groove 
(6), which is annularly arranged co-axially in the butting region 

between both the oil and piston chambers (2 and 2.2), and is led on the 
oppositely disposed piston chamber side into an oil reservoir (37) 

provided co-axially behind the second oil and piston chamber (2.2).
