<ABSTRACT>
An accumulating device (2) having ten accumulating 
units (11) connected at the input (50) to a conveyor 

belt system (9) and designed to house a number of mail 
items (7). Each accumulating unit (11) comprises a 

conveyor system (65) composed of two belts (66, 67) 
contacting each other along a substantially straight 

portion (68) and having a sensor (90) for generating an 
enabling signal upon a mail item being fed into the 

accumulating unit (11). As a consequence of the enabling 
signal, the belts (66, 67) are shifted one discrete step 

so that the mail items (7) fed into the accumulating 
unit (11) are inserted between the two belts (66, 67) 

and overlap one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mail
accumulating device.Postal machines are known featuring at least one
accumulating device (stacker) comprising a number of
accumulating units (pockets) for housing mail items
(letters and postcards) fed to the accumulating device
by a supply system output-connected to the accumulating
units and supplied with mail items by a sorting device
(e.g. a code reader).The mail items form a substantially orderly pile
of letters and postcards inside the accumulating units,
and are withdrawn manually by an operator or
automatically by an unloading robot when the pile
reaches a given height.Unloading of the accumulating units takes a
certain amount of time, thus slowing down the sorting
process and impairing the efficiency of the machine as a
whole. Document EP-A-552 778 describes a postal machine as defined
in the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an accumulating device wherein unloading of the 
accumulating units involves substantially no downtime.According to the present invention, there is
provided a mail accumulating device comprising:
at least two accumulating units, each designed to
house a number of mail items;a first conveyor system moving towards, and
designed to feed said mail items into, said accumulating
units; anda second conveyor system for receiving the mail
items at the output of said accumulating units;said accumulating
units comprise conveyor means moved by drive means and
designed to retain and feed said mail items along a path
extending between the input and output of said units,
characterized by the facteach said accumulating unit also comprising first sensor
means for detecting entry of a mail item into the unit,
and for generating a first signal for enabling said
drive means;said conveyor means moving the mail items in said
unit from said input to said output in discrete steps
effected for each enabling signal generated by said
sensor means, so as to form a group of mail items
aligned along said conveyor means and overlapping one
another.A preferred, non-limiting embodiment of the
present invention will be described by way of example
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a simplified, partially schematic 
front view of a postal machine featuring two
accumulating devices in accordance with the teachings of
the present invention;Figure 2 shows a front view of an accumulating
device in accordance with the teachings of the present
