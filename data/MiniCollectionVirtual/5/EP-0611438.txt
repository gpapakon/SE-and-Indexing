<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical measuring instruments and, in particular to a 
bidirectional fringe-counting two-beam interferometer system. Stimulated by the development of the 633nm helium-neon laser in the early 
1960's with its intense collimated beam and narrow bandwidth, interferometric length 
measurement has become one of the most widely implemented techniques of precision 
measurement. It is used for measurements of length ranging from less than a micrometre, 
to distances of tens of metres. For the highest accuracy (approaching 1 part in 109, the laser 
source must be stabilised in frequency and calibrated by comparison with a reference laser 
and, where the measurement application is in the free atmosphere, it is essential 
continuously to correct the wavelength of the radiation for the refractive index of the air 
Over shorter distances where a high measurement precision is required, it is necessary to 
resolve fractions of an optical fringe. In these applications unwanted reflections and 
polarisation effects become fundamental limitations as they cause fringe distortion and limit 
the fidelity of the electronic signals. Bidirectional counting techniques are used to correct automatically for 
vibration or retraced motion, ensuring that the fringe count represents the displacement of 
the moving reflector. For optimum performance bi-directional counters require two signals 
with constant average dc levels and sinusoidal components, related to the optical path 
difference in the interferometer, that are in phase quadrature. The counter logic is set to 
respond each time one of the signals passes through its average value. Unfortunately, in 
practice this dc level is subject to variations. For example, its value is dependent on the 
intensity of the light source. Removal of the dc component by capacitance coupling, so that 
the average signal level is always zero, is not completely effective because the frequency 
of the sinusoidal component may be very low and, indeed, zero if the corner cube 
retro-reflector attached to the workpiece is stationary. It is common practice either to employ some form of modulation of the 
interferometer signal or to maintain the average signal level at zero volts by an electronic 
subtraction process which removes variations in the average signal level from the 
photodetector signals and avoids the need for modulation. However, instruments using  
 
these methods involve the use of polarisation techniques, introducing a 90° phase difference 
between the
