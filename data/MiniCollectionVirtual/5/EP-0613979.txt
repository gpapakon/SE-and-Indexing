<ABSTRACT>
The formation of paper webs useful for facial tissue, bath tissue, 
paper towels or the like is substantially improved by forming the 

web in layers in which the second-formed layer has a consistency which 
is significantly less than the consistency of the first-formed layer. 
The web is formed in layers by using a layered headbox (1) wherein 
first and second stock layers are separated by a headbox divider (2). 
The resulting improvement in formation provides a significant improvement 
in softness, particularly for wet-pressed tissues, while reducing the 

degree to which fibers protrude from the surface of the tissue.
 

This also reduces the tendency of the web to lint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of layering to make tissue products such as facial and 
bath tissue is well known in the art. Layering affords an 
opportunity to more precisely engineer the tissue by placing 
different fibers in the inner and outer layers to take advantage of 
the different properties that the different fibers offer. Because 
improving softness is frequently an objective for many tissue 
products, it is logical to place the softer fibers in the outer 
layers while other fibers occupy the center of the tissue. 
Eucalyptus fibers are well known for their softness properties, in 
part due to their short fiber length. By placing the relatively 
short eucalyptus fibers in the outer layer, these fibers can be made 
to stand on end to protrude from the surface of the tissue to create 
a velvety feel. As the number of protruding surface fibers 
increases, the softness also increases. However, increasing the 
short fiber content of the outer layers of tissues often leads to 
excessive linting, which is undesirable and is a common complaint 
among soft tissue users. Hence there is a need for a method of 
making a softer tissue without increasing the number of protruding 
surface fibers. It has now been discovered that the softness of layered tissues 
is greatly influenced by how well the tissue sheet is formed. While 
the number of protruding surface fibers can improve perceived 
softness of tissues at low levels of sheet formation, at higher 
formation levels the perceived softness has been found to improve 
with increasing formation, while at the same time the number of 
protruding surface fibers decreases (as measured by the Surface Fiber  
 
Index, hereinafter defined). The net result is a softer tissue with 
fewer protruding fiber ends and hence a lesser tendency to create 
dust or lint during use, which addresses a common complaint among 
current soft tissue users. Hence, contrary to the teachings of the 
prior art, the softness of a tissue can be improved even though the 
number of protruding surface fibers is decreased. More specifically, it has been found that the formation of a 
layered tissue can be greatly improved by adjusting the relative 
consistencies of the stock layers as the tissue sheet is formed such 
that the consistency of one or more of the second, third, fourth, 
etc. stock layers is (are) less than the consistency of the first 
layer. (As defined herein, the "first" stock layer is the only stock 
layer which comes in direct contact with the forming fabric or is the 
first to come in direct

<CLAIMS>
In a method of forming a tissue web of papermaking fibers with a 
layered headbox (1) wherein first and second stock layers, separated 

by a headbox divider (2), are continuously deposited onto an endless 
forming fabric (3) to form a wet web such that the second stock 

layer is superposed on top of the first stock layer and the 
first stock layer directly contacts the forming fabric (3), said wet 

web being thereafter dried to form a tissue web, the improvement 
comprising providing a ratio of the consistency of the second 

stock layer to the consistency of the first stock layer of about 
0.95 or less.

or less.

about 0.1 to about 0.7.

The method of Claim 1 further comprising a third stock layer 
superposed on top of the second stock layer, wherein the ratio 

of the consistency of the third stock layer to the consistency 
of the first stock layer is about 0.95 or less.

the third stock layer to the consistency of the first stock 

layer is about 0.7 or less. 
The method of Claim 7 wherein the ratio of the consistency of 
the third stock layer to the consistency of the first stock
