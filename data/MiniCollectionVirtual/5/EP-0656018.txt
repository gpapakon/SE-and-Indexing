<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the
preparation and use of non-crystalline high molecular
weight hydrocarbon soluble drag reducing polymers.More specifically this invention relates to a
method for producing a highly active, non-hazardous, easily
transported and easily handled suspension of drag reducing
polymers having increased performance characteristics.It is known that certain polymers which are oil
soluble may be polymerized in the presence of catalysts to
produce high molecular weight non-crystalline hydrocarbon
soluble materials by various means. These polymers, when
dissolved in a hydrocarbon fluid flowing through a conduit,
greatly reduce turbulent flow and decrease "drag" thus
reducing the amount of horsepower needed to move a given
volume of fluid or conversely, enabling greater volumes of
fluid to be moved with a given amount of power. Further,
dilute solutions of high molecular weight polymers in
solvents such as hydrocarbons, display useful flow
characteristics unusual to the commonly known crystalline,
largely non-soluble, artifact-forming polymers such as
polyethylene and polypropylene. In particular, these
hydrocarbon soluble materials are noted for their
effectiveness as drag reducing agents and anti-misting
agents. An anti-misting agent is a polymer which, when
dissolved in a hydrocarbon, serves to significantly
increase medium droplet size and thereby reduce
flammability of fuel sprays caused by high velocity wind
shear, such as that as which occurs during rupture of a
fuel cell resulting from impact such as an airplane crash. One important aspect of such polymers are their
susceptibility to shear degradation when dissolved in
hydrocarbons. Thus, passage through a pump and severe
constrictions in the pipeline where turbulent
flow is encountered can shear the polymer and thereafter
reduce its effectiveness. Consequently, it is important
that these polymers be placed into the flowing hydrocarbon
in a form which achieves certain desirable features.The polymer should be placed in a form adequate
for easy transportation and handling without exotic or
unusual equipment, since injection points can often be at
remote and inaccessible locations. The polymer must also
be a form which dissolves rapidly in the hydrocarbon being
transported, since the polymers have little drag reducing
effect until solubilized. The polymer should also be
innocuous to the ultimate purpose of the hydrocarbon fluid.
For example, in the case of a crude oil flowing through a
pipeline, larger amounts of water and
