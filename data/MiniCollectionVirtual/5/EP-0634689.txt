<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed of preparing a 
radiation sensitive silver halide emulsion comprising 

reacting silver and halide ions in a dispersing medium 
in the presence of a metal hexacoordination complex 

having at least one organic ligand containing at least 
one carbon-to-carbon bond, at least one carbon-to-hydrogen 

bond or at least one carbon-to-nitrogen-to-hydrogen 
bond sequence and at least half of the metal 

coordination sites occupied by halide or pseudohalide 
ligands. The metal forming the complex is chosen from 

periods 4, 5 and 6 and groups 3 to 14 inclusive of the 
periodic table of elements. The incorporation of the 

transition metal ion dopant and at least one organic 
ligand into the cubic crystal lattice of the silver 

halide grains can be used to improve photographic 
performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photography. More
specifically, the invention relates to photographic
silver halide emulsions and to processes for their
preparation.All references to periods and groups within
the periodic table of elements are based on the format
of the periodic table adopted by the American Chemical
Society and published in the Chemical and Engineering
News, Feb. 4, 1985, p. 26. In this form the prior
numbering of the periods was retained, but the Roman
numeral numbering of groups and the A and B group
designations (having opposite meanings in the U.S. and
Europe) were replaced by a simple left to right 1
through 18 numbering of the groups.The term "dopant" is employed herein to
designate any element or ion other than silver or
halide incorporated in a face centered silver halide
crystal lattice.The term "metal" in referring to elements
includes all elements other than those of the following
atomic numbers: 2, 5-10, 14-18, 33-36, 52-54, 85 and
86.The term "Group VIII metal" refers to an
element from period 4, 5 or 6 and any one of groups 8
to 10 inclusive.The term "Group VIII noble metal" refers to
an element from period 5 or 6 and any one of groups 8
to 10 inclusive.The term "palladium triad metal" refers to an
element from period 5 and any one of groups 8 to 10
inclusive. The term "platinum triad metal" refers to an
element from period 6 and any one of groups 8 to 10
inclusive.The term "halide" is employed in its
conventional usage in silver halide photography to
indicate chloride, bromide or iodide.The term "pseudohalide" refers to groups
known to approximate the properties of halides--that
is, monovalent anionic groups sufficiently electronegative
to exhibit a positive Hammett sigma value at least
equaling that of a halide--e.g., CN-, OCN-, SCN-,
SeCN-, TeCN-, N3-, C(CN)3- and CH-.The term "C-C, H-C or C-N-H organic" refers
to groups that contain at least one carbon-to-carbon
bond, at least one carbon-to-hydrogen bond or at least
one carbon-to-nitrogen-to-hydrogen bond sequence.To avoid repetition, it is understood that
all references to photographic emulsions are to
negative-working photographic emulsions, except as
otherwise indicated.Research Disclosure is published by Kenneth
