<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a mixture of zirconia and a stabilising 
agent for the zirconia comprises milling an aqueous suspension of 

particulate zirconia and particulate stabilising agent in a bead mill for 
at least 2 minutes in the presence of a particulate mixing medium 

having an average particle size from 0.2 mm to 3 mm. Preferred 
stabilising agents are oxides of yttrium, cerium, calcium or 

magnesium. Surprisingly, ceramics prepared from the product 
mixture are more resistant to degradation by attack from water above 

100Â°C than are ceramics prepared from coprecipitated powders.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing powder 
mixtures and in particular to preparing mixtures of zirconia and 
stabilising agents for zirconia. It is known that the incorporation of certain agents known as 
stabilising agents into a ceramic material based on zirconia can 
improve the strength of the ceramic by stabilising the zirconia in the 
tetragonal or cubic crystal habit. Typical stabilising agents are yttria, alkaline earth oxides, and 
rare earth oxides and it is known to mix these agents with zirconia by 
several techniques. When powdered zirconia and powdered 
stabilising agent are mixed it is difficult to produce a homogeneous 
mixture even if the mixture is partially sintered and subsequently 
reground. A co-precipitate of zirconia and a stabiliser has been 
prepared from an aqueous solution of a compound of zirconium and 
a compound of the stabilising element and the co-precipitate is 
subsequently calcined and ground. Both these techniques are energy-intensive. 
An alternative technique which has been shown to produce 
zirconia which is suitable for forming ceramics having good physical 
properties is the formation of a coating of stabilising agent on 
particles of zirconia by precipitation of the agent from solution in the 
presence of dispersed particulate zirconia. This process, however, is 
relatively complex and involves several steps. EP-A-0 312 932 relates to grinding of ceramics using 
agitated media milling. Example 1 of this document shows 
a process comprising forming an aqueous suspension containing 
zirconia powder, water and a dispersant, loading 
this suspension in an attritor with yttria-modified 
zirconia balls having a size of 0,8 mm and milling for 
4,5 hours.  
 The present invention provides a simpler means of obtaining a 
mixture of zirconia and stabilising agent and the product of the 
invention is suitable for producing ceramics having physical and 
chemical properties similar to those produced from coated 
particulate zirconia. According to the invention, a process for preparing a mixture 
of zirconia and a stabilising agent for the zirconia comprises forming 
an aqueous suspension containing particulate zirconia and particulate 
stabilising agent and agitating said suspension in a bead mill in the 
presence of a particulate mixing medium for at least 2 minutes, said 
mixing medium having an average particle size of from 0.2 mm to 3 
mm.  
 The process of the invention can be operated as a batch 
process or a continuous process. In a batch process the
