<ABSTRACT>
Color bleed on paper media printed by ink-jet is alleviated 
by altering the dyes such that they become more 

bleed resistant. To this end, an organic compound with 
surfactant properties is substituted as the dye counter-ion. 

Specifically, a dye having one or more sulfonate or 
carboxylate groups is provided with a counter-ion comprising 

an amine having the formula given by 

⁺N-(CH₃)

-(CH₂)
n
-R
where 
m
 ranges from 1 to 3, 
n
 ranges from 3 to 6, and R a 
hydrophilic substituent or cycloaliphatic or aromatic group 

with a hydrophilic substituent. An ink employing the dye 
of the invention comprises (a) about 0.5 to 40 wt% of one 

or more low vapor pressure solvents (b) about 0.5 to 5 wt% 
one or more water-soluble dyes in which one or more of the 

counter-ions have been substituted with the above amine, 
and (c) the balance water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inks employed in ink-jet
printing, especially in thermal ink-jet printing, and,
more particularly, to colored ink compositions in which
color bleed is substantially reduced or even eliminated.Thermal ink-jet printers offer a low cost, high quality,
and comparatively noise-free option to other types of
printers commonly used with computers. Such printers employ
a resistor element in a chamber provided with an
egress for ink to enter from a plenum. The plenum is connected
to a reservoir for storing the ink. A plurality of
such resistor elements are arranged in a particular pattern,
called a primitive, in a printhead. Each resistor
element is associated with a nozzle in a nozzle plate,
through which ink is expelled toward a print medium. The
entire assembly of printhead and reservoir comprise an ink-jet
pen.In operation, each resistor element is connected via
a conductive trace to microprocessor, where current-carrying
signals cause one or more selected elements to heat up.
The heating creates a bubble of ink in the chamber, which
is expelled through the nozzle toward the print medium. In
this way, firing of a plurality of such resistor elements 
in a particular order in a given primitive forms alphanumeric
characters, performs area-fill, and provides other
print capabilities on the medium.Recent innovations in thermal ink-jet printing have
been directed to providing the capability of color printing.
Typically, yellow, magenta, and cyan inks are employed.
These three primary colors, when mixed in various
combinations, provide a full color palette. Black printing
is provided either with a separate black ink or by composite
printing of yellow, magenta, and cyan inks.During printing, a color may require more than one
drop of ink at a particular pixel location, either of the
same color (to control hue) or of a different color (to
provide a specific color). Such multiple drops of ink at
one location can provide a heavy dye load on the print medium,
or paper.Heavy dye loads of various colored inks on paper can
lead to bleed and reduction of waterfastness. Bleed, as
used herein, is the invasion of one color into another color
on paper, which is a surface phenomenon. This is in
contradistinction to uses of the term in the prior art,
which tend to define "bleed" in the context of ink of a
single color following the fibers of the paper; this is a
sub-surface phenomenon.Bleed control has been achieved by addition of one or
more surfactants; see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,116,409, issued
