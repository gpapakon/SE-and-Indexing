<DESCRIPTION>
A novel technique using microwave energy for enzymatic 
digestion of DNA molecules is disclosed. The enzymatic digestion of isolated DNA from 
procaryotes, eucaryotes, and plasmids is a time-consuming 
but necessary step for further gene studies and requires 
consistent cleavage of DNA molecules or segments at 
specific sites. Several factors can affect the outcome. 
Variations in yield and quality of the cleaved fragments 
from digestion to digestion probably result from 
inconsistent temperatures and enzymatic activity that occur 
over the hours it may take to effect complete digestion of 
large macromolecules. Impurities in DNA samples may retard 
processing and produce inconsistent products. Traditionally, digestions of DNA with restriction 
endonucleases are carried out in a buffer containing salts 
and reducing agent in an incubator at 37Â°C, considered to 
be the optimum temperature for activity of most enzymes. 
Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., and Maniatis, T., Molecular 
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor 
Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York (1989). The 
incubation time varies with the type and quality of DNA and 
the particular restriction endonuclease used. Although the 
digestion of plasmid DNA with some enzymes can be achieved 
in 1 hour using a large amount of enzyme, in general, 
cleaving genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases takes 
from eight hours to overnight and thus is a time-consuming 
technique by conventional methods. Accordingly, there 
remains a need for a rapid, efficient, and consistent 
procedure for digesting DNA. The effects of microwave energy on chemical processes 
has been studied for many years. Abramovitch, et al., Org. 
Prep. Proced. Int. (1991) 23:683-711. Microwaves have been 
used to drive the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals (Hwang, 
et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. (1987) 23:1799-801),  
 
hydrolyses (Abramovitch, et al., (1991) TetrahedronLet. 
32:5251-54), polymerizations (U.S. Patent Serial No. 
3,432,413), and the synthesis of organic compounds (Gedye, 
et al., Can. J. Chem. (1991) 69:706-11; Ito, et al. J. Mol. 
Evol. (1990) 31:187-94). Hydrolysis of biological 
materials has also been studied. Jahngen, et al., J. Org. 
Chem. (1990) 55:3406-9; Margolis, et al., J. Auto. Chem. 
(1991) 13:93-95; Feinberg, et al. (1991) Analusis 19:47-55. However, when living systems or tissues are exposed to 
concentrated microwave energy, the effects have been 
deleterious for the most part. Belkhode, et al., J.
