<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to relatively low cost pressureless
sintered silicon carbide ceramic composites having relatively high
electrical conductivity, relatively high density and relatively
great mechanical strength, in comparison to those known to persons
skilled in the art, and a process for making such composites.For many devices in the electrical power, electrochemical and
gas appliance industries, there is an increasing need for
conductive ceramics with light weight, good thermal conductivity,
high mechanical strength and good oxidation resistance, especially
at elevated temperatures. Such ceramics can serve to conduct
electrical current, absorb power surges, generate heat for many
purposes and/or serve as elevated temperature structural elements.
For reasons of economy, it is usually highly preferable that such
articles and devices be made from relatively inexpensive raw
materials, but that such articles and devices also last for a
substantial length of time in service. Additionally, it is often
very desirable that the materials be readily formable into complex
shapes at relatively low cost; for ceramic materials, this often
requires pressureless sintering and mass production shaping 
methods, such as injection molding and dry pressing.Conventionally, for electrically conductive heating elements,
recrystallised silicon carbide material is used to form the body.
The reasons often stated for using a recrystallization process
include the driving off of impurities, including without limitation
excess, uncombined silicon, and to otherwise react as much free
silicon as possible with carbon to produce additional silicon
carbide. Further, recrystallization is employed by some in an
attempt to ensure that all of the structure is crystalline, and
that the crystals are all of the α-phase, to ensure more uniform
electrical resistivity. Also, recrystallization is believed by
some to serve to bond the crystalline structure together by
reformation of the crystals so as to produce crystalline grain
growth.A recrystallized silicon carbide body usually has the required
electrical conductivity [between about 1 and 100 (Ω-cm)-1], however,
such bodies, e.g., in the form of heating elements, tend to be of
relatively low density (typically less than about 2.5 gram/cm3),
with a relatively high degree of porosity and relatively quite low
strength. Furthermore, it is often difficult, if not impossible,
to achieve sufficient control, in the manufacture of such
recrystallised silicon carbide heating element bodies, to obtain
