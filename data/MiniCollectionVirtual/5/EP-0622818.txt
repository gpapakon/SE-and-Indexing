<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a key switch (push-button switch) for making contact with a stationary contact which is arranged on a printed circuit board. The key switch contains a mating contact which can be mounted on a printed circuit board, can be pressed axially against the stationary contact, and is provided with a flexible membrane (diaphragm). For easier assembly (installation) and guidance of the mating contact, said mating contact has a dimensionally rigid annular body which is connected to a central pin via a membrane which is in the form of a plate.
