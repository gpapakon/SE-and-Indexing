<ABSTRACT>
Process for treating polluting waste and incorporating it in a binder to form large-volume blocks. An aqueous binder is employed, based on blast furnace clinker cement and/or a powdered clinker-based product, mixed with a fine silica powder and with at least one magnesium, potassium or aluminium compound.

<CLAIMS>
Process for treatment of pollutant waste comprising
at least one of the following compounds: heavy metal

chlorides, organic pollutants, metallic oxides, or Ca
++
,
by incorporating them in a binder to form blocks of large

volume, 
characterised by
 the fact that an aqueous binder
is used based on blast-furnace slag cement and/or a

powder of a product based on blast-furnace slag, the
granular dimension of which is less than 200 µm, mixed

with a fine silica powder having a granular dimension of
less than 10 µm and the content by weight of which is

between 5 and 20% relative to the blast-furnace slag and

at least one compound of magnesium, potassium, or
aluminium.
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on magnesium contains
magnesium chloride.
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on magnesium contains
magnesia.
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on magnesium contains
magnesium sulphate.
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on potassium contains
potassium sulphate. 
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on aluminium contains
alumina cement or sodium aluminate.
Process as described in claim 1, 
characterised by

the fact that the compound based on aluminium contains
alumina.
Process as described in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 the fact that the mixture is
created in proportions of between approximately 2 and 150

kg of compounds of magnesium, potassium, or aluminium for
100 kg of binder.
Process as described in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 the fact that 5 to 100% by
weight of clay, relative to the binder, are introduced

into the mixture.
Process as described in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 the fact that active carbon is
also introduced into the mixture.
