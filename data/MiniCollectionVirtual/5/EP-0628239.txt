<ABSTRACT>
A grass cutting device suitable for automatic and 
unattended operation, comprises

 
   at least one drive wheel (8);

 
   a power unit (10) operatively coupled to the drive wheel to 

propel the device;
 

   a cutter mechanism (23) to cut grass over which the device 
passes and

 
   obstacle detection means (45) capable of detecting an 

obstacle in the path of the device and being operably linked 
to the power unit to cause the device to retreat and turn 

away from the obstacle. 
The grass cutting device preferably further comprises 
mechanical long grass detection means (50) arranged to detect 

long grass in the path of the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grass cutting device,
in particular to a form of lawn mower for automatic and
unattended operation.Lawn mowers are widely used for the maintenance of
lawns, mainly at residential homes, but also in commercial
environments. Mowers were originally manually operated,
relying on the user to push them along. Nowadays, the
cutters are commonly powered by electrical or petrol
engines, but the user must still exert a considerable force
to push the mower forwards. The majority of mowers
nonetheless still rely on a user to guide and operate them.
This makes lawn mowing a moderately arduous and
time-consuming task. For larger lawns, powered mowers may
take the form of small vehicles on which the user sits.
Such vehicles are expensive and only suitable for
large-scale applications.Automated mowers have been proposed in the past
which are suitable for unattended operation. These may
follow a pre-programmed path or may be mechanically guided,
e.g. along rails buried in the lawn. Such devices are very
limited in application, particularly since they are in
effect dedicated to a single lawn.French patent 2,645,700 discloses a grass cutting
device having at least one drive wheel, a power unit
operatively coupled to the drive wheel to propel the device,
a cutter mechanism to cut grass over which the device
passes, and obstacle detection means capable of detecting an
obstacle in the path of the device and being operably
linked to the power unit to cause the device to turn away
from the obstacle. According to the invention, there is provided a
grass cutting device suitable for automatic and unattended
operation, the device having at least one drive wheel, a
power unit operatively coupled to the drive wheel to propel
the device, a cutter mechanism to cut grass over which the
device passes, and obstacle detection means capable of
detecting an obstacle in the path of the device and being
operably linked to the power unit to cause the device to
retreat and turn away from the obstacle, characterised in
that the obstacle detection means includes means for
detecting the edge of a depression in the path of the
device.The device according to the invention is
advantageous primarily in that it permits automatic and
unattended cutting of a lawn and as it can detect the
depression at the edge of a typical lawn it is not dedicated
by pre-programming or external guides to any particular
lawn, and is therefore versatile.The obstacle detection means most conveniently
comprises one or more mechanical sensors

<CLAIMS>
A grass cutting device suitable for automatic and
unattended operation, the device comprising:


at least one drive wheel (8);
a power unit (10) operatively coupled to the drive
wheel to propel the device;
a cutter mechanism (22,23) to cut grass over which the
device passes and
obstacle detection means (40) capable of detecting an
obstacle in the path of the device and being operably linked

to the power unit to cause the device to retreat and turn
away from the obstacle, characterised in that,
the obstacle detection means includes means (61) for
detecting the edge of a depression in the path of the

device.
A grass cutting device according to claim 1
characterised in that the device comprises mechanical long

grass detection means (50) arranged to detect long grass in
the path of the device.
A grass cutting device according to claim 2
characterised in that the mechanical long grass detection

means comprises a suspended pivoting vane (50) responsive to
the impact of long grass.
A grass cutting device according to claim 2 or
claim 3 characterised in that the long grass detection means

is arranged to activate the cutter mechanism in response to
the detection of long grass.
A grass cutting device according to any of claims
1 to 4 characterised in that the device comprises 


control means responsive to the obstacle detection
means to cause the device to retreat and turn away from the

obstacle, the angle through which the device turns being
varied in accordance with a program stored in the control

means.
A grass cutting device according to claim 5
characterised in that the device has two phases of

operation,

a first phase in which the device turns away from an
obstacle through a first angle, and
a second phase in which the device turns away from an
obstacle through a second angle, different from the first.
