<ABSTRACT>
Combined ignition/starter switches are high quality components which are particularly important to the correct operation of motor vehicles. They have recently also been used as an accessory which is particularly important for protection of vehicles against theft and unauthorised use. A wide range of additional devices is required for this purpose which must be installed either at the manufacturer's works or else at a later point in time in conjunction with or on the switch. In order to make this possible at any time without any structural changes and in a simple manner, without the combination ignition/starter switch having to be replaced by a different switch design for this purpose, it is proposed that the housing (4) of the combination ignition/starter switch (1) have a laterally projecting housing attachment (5) with a retaining opening (6) for an insert (7) containing the additional device (3), which insert (7) completely covers the retaining opening (6) and can be clipped to the housing attachment (5) by means of a detachable snap-action latching connection. This makes it possible to design the combination ignition/starter switch as a standard item with an integrated housing attachment and associated insert for accommodating a wide range of additional devices. Such combination ignition/starter switches can thus be manufactured in large quantities without any design change and can also be assembled only in this standard embodiment. This improves not only production and assembly of the combination ignition/starter switches and additional devices, but also simplifies their storage in a positive manner.

Ignition-starter switch (1) for motor vehicles with a 
receptacle for an additional device (3) such as, for 

example, a withdrawal stop, which co-operates with the 
switch, for the ignition key, characterised in that the 

housing (4) of the ignition-starter switch (1) has a 
push-in unit (7) for carrying the additional device 

(3), which unit is inserted in a laterally projecting 
housing extension (5) with a receptacle opening (6), 

completely covers the receptacle opening (6) and can be 
clipped onto the housing extension (5) by means of a 

releasable snap-action connection. 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the housing 

(4) of the ignition-starter switch (1) has an 
essentially circular cross section from which the 

housing extension (5) with the receptacle (2) for the 
additional device (3) projects approximately 

tangentially to the outer housing wall (8) and off-centre 
with respect to the centre axis (9) of the 

switch housing (4). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 

receptacle opening (6) for the additional device (3) in 
the housing extension (5) is enclosed by three wall 

parts (10, 11, 12) which each adjoin one another at a 
right angle and which leave a side wall opening free 

between them at the underside of the housing extension 
(5), which opening can be closed together with the 

receptacle opening (6) by the push-in unit (7). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that in the region of the housing extension (5) for the  
 

additional device the outer wall of the switch housing 
(4) comprises an aperture (13) which is only open to 

the extent required for the additional device (3) to 
operate. 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 

that the push-in unit (7) is of an angular construction 
and has a rear wall (14), which closes the receptacle 

opening (6) in the housing extension (5), and a push-in 
unit bottom (15) which projects from the rear wall at a 

right angle and closes the housing extension (5) at its 
underside. 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that parallel, spring clip fastenings (16, 17) project 
on both sides of the push-in unit bottom (15) from the 

rear wall (14) of the push-in unit (7), engage in 
parallel guide grooves (18, 19) in the two parallel 

side walls of the housing extension (5) and are secured 
in the inserted position by detent lugs (20, 21). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 

that the clip fastenings (16, 17) are U-shaped and 
secured in the inserted position by way of their U-bridge 

(22) by detent lugs (20, 21), which project 
outward in the guide grooves (18, 19) in the housing 

extension (5), at both side walls of the housing 
extension (5). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 

that retaining grooves (23) and/or apertures (24) are 
provided in the rear wall (14) and the bottom (15) of  

 
the push-in unit (7) for the clip-type fastening of 

various additional devices (3). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in 

that the switch housing (4) is formed in one piece from 
a plastic material with the housing extension (5). 
Ignition-starter switch with an additional device 
according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in 

that the push-in unit (7), which covers the receptacle 
opening (6) in the housing extension (5), is formed in 

one piece from a plastic material with the lateral clip 
fastenings (16, 17) projecting from the rear wall (14
) 
in parallel with one another.
