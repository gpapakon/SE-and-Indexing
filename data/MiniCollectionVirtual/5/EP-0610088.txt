<ABSTRACT>
A shielded electrical data connector (10) terminates 
a shielded multiconductor cable. The data connector 

includes an insulative housing having a conductive housing 
shield (16, 18) therein. A contact holding member (36) is 

accommodated in the connector housing and supports a row of 
plural spaced electrical contacts (52) thereon. A contact 

shield (38) is supported by the contact holding member. The 
contact shield has a shield extension (68) extending between 

at least two of the contacts so as to reduce cross-talk as 
between the two contacts. The contact shield (38) is 

electrically commoned with the housing shield (16, 18) to 
maintain continuous electrical shielding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
improvements in shielded electrical data connectors. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a shielded
electrical data connector having enhanced performance.The use of electrical connectors to terminate
electrical cable carrying data transmission signals is well-known.
Electrical connectors of this type are shown in
numerous patents including U. S. Patent No. 4,449,778, U. S.
Patent No. 4,501,459 and U. S. Patent No. 4,619,494. Each
of the connectors described in these patents includes a
connector shield. Shielded connectors provide protection
from electromagnetic and radio frequency interferences (EMI
and RFI) which may be present in the environment.Recently, the industry has been increasing the
rate of data signal transmission along the data cable. Data
rates of 100 mbps are now being achieved. These increased
data rates result in an increase in the cross-talk levels
between the conductors of the cable, which are terminated in
the electrical connector. While the shielding provided in
the above-identified data connectors is adequate for the
lower transmission rates, it has been found that this
shielding may not be sufficient for the increased signal
rates. At high data rates, the cross-talk problem is
particularly prevalent as between adjacent pairs of contacts
supported in the data connector housing. Improvements in
data connector shielding have been attempted. U. S. Patent
No. 5,030,115 shows an improved data connector shield
overcoat. However, improvements such as this do not address
cross-talk.It is, therefore, desirable to provide an
electrical connector which provides improved shielding to
reduce the cross-talk between contact pairs at high data
rates. US-A-4619494 mentioned above discloses a data connector comprising an insulative housing having a
conductive housing shield therein, an insulative contact holding member supporting a row
of plural spaced electrical contacts therein, the insulative housing accommodating the
holding member. However, there is no cross-talk shielding.DE-A-4040551 discloses a data connector having an insulative housing a
conductive housing shield therein, the housing supporting a row of electrical contacts, and a
series of individual contact shields between the contacts.EP-A-0268441 discloses a data connector having an insulative housing having a
conductive housing shield therein, a contact shield in the form of metallic ground structure,
electrically commoned with the housing shield, which supports an insulative
