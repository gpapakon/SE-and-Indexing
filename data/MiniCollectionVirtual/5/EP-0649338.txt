<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to apparatus (1) for distributing a gas in a liquid, particularly for "floating" particulate matter from raw or flocculated sewage, comprising an inlet (2) for a gas entrained in a liquid carrier such as recycled sewage, a sinuous part (16, 18) of a flow path (3) through the apparatus, and a downstream outlet (4, 11) of substantially uniform cross section adapted to allow gas to be released from the liquid carrier and to be dispersed laterally of the flow path (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nozzle, particularly such a nozzle as comprises or is
apparatus for distributing a gas in a liquid, and for use in a method of distributing
a gas in a liquid.It is often necessary to treat a body of liquid such as sewage to remove algae and
turbidity (solids content) prior to filtration. Thus to enable a relatively economic
high rate of filtration particularly during algal "blooms" for example in summer
months, it is necessary to remove solids prior to passage through a filter as such
"blooms" can rapidly "clog" a filter medium and render it inoperative. One way
to seek to achieve this treatment is counter-current dissolved air flotation in which
a total flow of sewage liquid (water) to be treated passes through a continuously
maintained bed of microscopic bubbles of a suitable gas, usually air above the
filter medium. The air bubbles attach themselves to insoluble particles, colloids
and the like in the sewage being treated, and by effectively modifying the
buoyancy of the solids etc., cause them to float to the surface, where they can be
removed, as scum, as and when desired.In order to introduce dissolved air, it is usually introduced through nozzles.
However, in order to produce the required release of microscopic air bubbles, the
nozzles have necessarily a fine aperture which aperture is readily clogged by
growing algae or solids in the liquids. Also, a great number of such nozzles is
required in order to provide a required "blanket" of bubbles of the required size.
This is therefore expensive in "down time" for cleaning, and capital cost,
associated with the distribution pipework. Examples of prior art nozzles can be
found in GB-A-2 108 858 and GB-A-1 444 027.It is an object of the invention to seek to mitigate these disadvantages. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided nozzle apparatus for
discharging gas entrained in a liquid into a liquid to introduce fine bubbles of gas
into that liquid, comprising an elongate body defining a flow path which, adjacent
an inlet to the body for the liquid with pressurised gas entrained therein, has a
sinuous path longitudinally of the body defined by two plate means extending
across the body, one plate means having a through orifice and the other plate
means having a blank portion, the orifice and blank portion being
aligned within of the body so as to define the sinuous path, and the body having
a substantially annular outlet for said liquid with pressurised gas entrained therein
which outlet has a
