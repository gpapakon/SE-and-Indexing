<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for leaching out salt cavities for the storage of natural gas with the use of natural gas as blanket medium, with a pipe string (1) cemented in the overburden (11) and in the salt dome (13) down to the cavity roof (15), a gas-delivery string (3) put into the pipe string (1) in a sealed-off manner and likewise extending down to the cavity roof, a protective liquid filling the annular space between the pipe strings, an outer flushing-pipe string (6) put into the gas-delivery string, variable in length and extending down below the blanket level, and a inner flushing-pipe string (8) located underneath, put into the outer flushing-pipe string and variable in length.

Method for leaching out salt caverns for storage of natural
gas using as blanket medium the subsequent storage medium,

natural gas, which remains gaseous at the pressures and
temperatures prevailing in the cavern, characterised in

that the natural gas used as the blanket medium remains in
the leached-out cavern for the gas operations.
Method according to claim 1, wherein

underground equipment intended for the subsequent gas
operations and comprising a gas delivery string with

an above-ground gas delivery head and concentric
flushing pipe strings of variable length is introduced

into the cap rock for the leaching,
the leaching is performed through the flushing pipe
strings,
the natural gas storage medium to be stored in the
leached-out cavern and remain gaseous at the

temperatures prevailing in the cavern is stored in the
cavern at a pressure such that a predetermined blanket

level is obtained,
the free ends of the inner and/or outer flushing pipe
string(s) are moved according to the blanket level to

be obtained, and
the flushing pipe strings remain in the gas delivery
string after the leaching out has been completed.
Device for putting into practice the method according to
claim 1 or claim 2 for leaching out salt caverns,

comprising

a pipe string (1) cemented in the cap rock (11) and in
the salt dome (13) as far as the roof (15) of the

cavern,
a gas delivery string (3) sealingly suspended therein
and likewise extending as far as the cavern roof (15),

comprising a gas delivery head located above-ground
and intended for the subsequent gas operations and

underground equipment,
a protective liquid filling the annular space between
the cemented-in pipe string and the gas delivery

string,
an outer flushing pipe string (6) of adjustable length

suspended in the gas delivery string and reaching to
below the blanket level, and
an inner flushing pipe string(8) of adjustable length
suspended in the outer flushing pipe string,
wherein the outer and inner flushing pipe strings (6,
8) remain in the gas delivery string (3) after the

leaching process has been completed.
