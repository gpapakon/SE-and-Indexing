<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector having a hollow electrically 
insulating body (1), one end (2) of which carries a set of 

male electrical contact members (3), the body (1) having 
first (4) and second (5) body parts which together define 

the body, one of which parts defines the said one end (2) 
of the body and the other of which parts defines the other 

end (22) of the body, characterised in that the said one 
body part (4) is formed with an opening or recess (17) 

communicating with the hollow interior of the body, and in 
that said other body part (5) is adapted for reception 

within the recess or opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector. More
specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to
an electrical connector of the kind used by international
travellers to enable the connection of electrical appliances
conforming to one standard of plug configuration to
electrical outlets or sockets formed to receive plugs
conforming to a different standard.GB-A-2185645 discloses an electrical plug having a base
and a cap attached to the base. The base includes an
integral flange which projects beyond the edges of the cap
so that it is engaged by the fingers of a person in order to
pull the plug out of a socket.It is an object of the invention to provide an
electrical connector which can be made and assembled simply
with the minimum of hand labour. It is a particular object
of the invention to provide a connector which requires no
fixing screws or the like in its assembly.According to the invention, an electrical connector
comprises a hollow electrically insulating body, one end of
which carries a set of male electrical contact members, the
body having first and second body parts which together
define the body, the first body part defining the said one
end of the body and including an opening or recess
communicating with the hollow interior of the body, and the
second body part defining the other end of the body, and
being adapted for reception within the recess or opening,
characterised by a socket in one of the body parts and by a
pin or spigot carried on the other body part for frictional engagement
in the socket. A result of this construction is that the
forces imposed on the body on inserting or removing the
connector from a wall socket or the like do not tend to pull 
the connector apart as is usual with the conventional
connectors, e.g. so-called mains plugs since the hand will
gasp and apply force to the part of the body carrying the
male connecting members. For this reason it is possible to
join the two body parts together without the need for
screws. Preferably the arrangement is such that the other
body part is wholly received within the opening in the one
body part so that the external surface of the other body
part is flush with the surface of the portion of the one
body part which defines the opening.The other body part may be formed with a socket array
arranged to receive a coresponding set of male electrical
connecting members. Preferably the hollow body contains
electrical conductors connecting the set of male electrical
connecting members carried by the one body part to

An electrical connector having a hollow electrically
insulating body (1), one end (2) of which carries a set of

male electrical contact members (3), the body (1) having
first (4) and second (5) body parts which together define

the body, the first body part (4) defining the said one end
(2) of the body and including an opening or recess (17)

communicating with the hollow interior of the body, and the
second body part (5) defining the other end (22) of the

body and being adapted for reception within the recess or
opening (17),

   characterised by a socket (12) in one of the body
parts and by a pin or spigot (23) carried on the other body

part for frictional engagement in the socket (12).
An electrical connector according to claim 1,
characterised in that the second body part (5) includes a

socket array (6) arranged to receive a corresponding set of
male electrical connecting members, in that the hollow body

(1) contains electrical conductors (7) connecting the set
of male electrical connecting members (3) carried by the

first body part (4) to the socket array (6), the conductors
being trapped between the first and the second body parts

(4,5) whereby the conductors (7) are located in position,
and in that the spigot (12) and socket (23) locate the

electrical conductors (7) in place in the body. 
An electrical connector according to claim 1,
characterised in that the second body part (5) includes a

socket array (6) arranged to receive a corresponding set of
male electrical connecting members.
An electrical connector according to claim 3,
characterised in that the hollow body (1) contains

electrical conductors (7) connecting the set of male
electrical connecting members (3) carried by the first body

part (4) to the socket array (6), the conductors being
trapped between the first and the second body parts (4,5)

whereby the conductors (7) are located in position.
An electrical connector according to claim 4,
characterised in that the spigot (12) and socket (23)

locate the electrical conductors (7) in place in the body.
An electrical connector according to claim 2 or 5,
characterised in that the electrical conductors (7) include

apertures (14) adapted to receive respective pins or
spigots (23).
An electrical connector according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the second body part (5) is

substantially wholly received within the opening or recess
(22) in the first body part (4) so that the external

surface 
of the second body part (5) is flush with the surface of

the portion of the first body part (4) which defines the
opening or recess (22).
