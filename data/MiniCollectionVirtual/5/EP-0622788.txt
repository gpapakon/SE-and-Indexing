<ABSTRACT>
An optical pickup apparatus for irradiating a light beam on an optical recording 
medium (8) for recording or reproduction, including a light source (1), an objective 

lens (7), a nonpolarization beam splitter (10), a photodetector (9), and a 1/4 wavelength 
plate (6). The objective lens (7) focuses the light beam radiated from the light 

source (1) on to the recording layer of the optical recording medium (8). The 
nonpolarization beam splitter (10) is disposed between the objective lens (7) and the 

light source (1) and separates the light beam emitted from the light source (1) and the 
light beam reflected by the recording layer of the optical recording medium (8). The 

photodetector (9) receives the beam of light reflected by the recording layer of the 
optical recording medium (8) which has been separated by the nonpolarization beam 

splitter (10) and deflected 90° in optical path. The 1/4 wavelength plate (6) is disposed 
on the path of emission of the light beam emitted from the light source (1) between the 

nonpolarization beam splitter and the optical recording medium (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical pickup apparatus
for irradiating a light beam on an optical recording medium for
recording and/or reproduction. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an optical pickup apparatus for irradiating
a light beam on an optical recording medium for recording and/or
reproduction using a nonpolarization beam splitter.Recently, with the amount of information increasing so much,
there have been demands for even higher recording densities of
storage in the optical discs used for packaging media for audio
and visual information such as computer storage devices, compact
discs, and video discs. To obtain such higher density optical
discs, it is necessary to either shorten the wavelength λ of the
light beam emitted from the light source or else to increase the
numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens. This gives rises
to several problems.A conventional example will be first described with Figs.
1 and 2.Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional optical
pickup apparatus. Fig. 2 is a view of the optical path of the 
optical pickup apparatus. Reference numeral 1 denotes a laser
beam generating device used as a light source. The laser beam
generating device 1 has a semiconductor laser 1a, a lens 1b, a
pair of reflectors 1c and 1d, a 1/4 wavelength plate 1e, a solid-state
laser medium 1f, a non-linear optical crystal element 1g,
a temperature control device 1h, and a cabinet 1i. The
semiconductor laser 1a emits a pumping light beam for exciting
the laser medium 1f. The lens 1b converges the pumping light
beam radiated from the semiconductor laser 1a through the
reflector 1c on the laser medium 1f. The pair of reflectors 1c
and 1d constitute a resonator. The laser medium 1f and the non-linear
optical crystal element 1g are disposed in this resonator
constituted by the pair of reflectors 1c and 1d. On one surface
of the 1/4 wavelength plate 1e, that is, the surface facing the
semiconductor laser 1a, is provided the reflector 1c. The
reflector 1c exhibits wavelength selectivity such that it
transmits through the pumping light beam having a wavelength, for
example, 810 nm radiated from the semiconductor laser 1a while
reflecting the light beam generated by the laser medium 1f having
a wavelength, for example 1064 nm. The 1/4 wavelength plate 1e
performs type II phase matching between the light beam emitted
from the laser medium 1f i.e. the fundamental wavelength laser
light beam and the second harmonic laser light beam generated by
the non-linear optical crystal
