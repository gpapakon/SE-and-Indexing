<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and assembly 
suited to determining the size and position of a head 

(8, 9) relative to a clamp (11) when using an industrial 
multi-axis robot (4). The invention is based on moving 

the clamp (11) by means of the robot (4) advantageously 
past three sensor elements (16) and providing the clamp 

with a target element (13) suitable for aiding in the 
position detection of the reference point of the clamp 

(11) at the instant the clamp moves past a first sensor 
element. The size and position of the head (8, 9) are 

determined on the basis of geometrical lines computed 
from the head edge intercept signals obtained by means 

of the sensor elements (16). The lengths of the 
geometrical lines are determined from the speed of the 

clamp (11) and the time intervals of intersect instants 
counted by a control system counter card connected to 

said sensor elements (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1
for determining the size and position of head of paper rolls picked by means of a
clamp.The invention further concerns an assembly according to the preamble of claim 8
for implementing said method.The present invention is particularly suited to the handling of outer heads, while it
can also be applied to inner heads though the positional accuracy requirements
associated with the latter are much more relaxed.A wide paper roll delivered from a paper machine is first taken to a slitter and
slit into rolls of appropriate width. Subsequently, the rolls are wrapped for transportation.
During the wrapping of paper rolls, the inner heads are first placed on
the ends of each roll, after which a sufficient length of the wrapper is wrapped
about the roll and then the overlaps of the wrapper are crimped against the rims
of the inner heads. Conventionally using a hot-melt glue, an outer head is next
adhered to the ends of the roll covering the crimped overlap of the wrapper and
the inner head. The inner head is usually relatively thick and thus capable of protecting
the roll end against mechanical damage. The outer head can thus be
thinner serving for the purpose of binding the wrapper at the roll ends and protecting
the roll against humidity. Frequently, the coloring and printed pattern of
the outer head are designed to give the roll a neat appearance. Prior to wrapping,
the roll width and diameter are measured, and on the basis of the measurement
result obtained, heads of suitable diameter are picked to be placed on the roll
ends.The end heads can be placed on the roll ends in multiple different ways. Manual
placement of the heads is the oldest method, and it is still suited for relatively 
small-capacity wrapping lines or applications not requiring an improved degree of
automation. In such method the operator simply places the inner heads manually
to the roll ends and the corresponding outer heads onto heated press platens,
which next press the outer heads to adhere to the roll ends. The inner heads are
kept against the roll ends by means of separate arms for the duration of the
crimping of the wrapper overlaps against the roll ends. The adherence of the
outer heads on the platens is in turn implemented with the help of a vacuum. In
manual packaging, the wrapping station operator verifies that heads of a correct
diameter are picked for the roll ends and that they are correctly placed.Various kinds of automatic heading machines have
