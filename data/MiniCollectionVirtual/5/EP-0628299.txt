<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes an ankle bandage of an elastic material which comprises a calf section (2) and a foot section (3). In the heel region of the foot section (3) there is a pronation restraint (4) of a material having high tearing and tensile strength. In the applied state of the bandage it can be tensioned laterally so as to extend essentially over the ankle in the direction towards the calf section (2) to which it can be fastened. This bandage is intended for immobilisation of an outer ligament in the case of lesion or rupture of an outer ligament. The foot is deliberately brought into a pronation position in order to relieve the outer ligament, so that the latter can heal better.

<CLAIMS>
Ankle joint bandage made from elastic material having a lower leg section (2) and 
a foot section (3), in which in the heel region of the foot section (3), a pronation 

restraint (4) of tear-resistant and extension-resistant material is applied, which in the 
applied condition of the bandage can be stretched laterally essentially over the ankle 

joint extending in the direction of the lower leg section (2) and can be attached 
thereto, characterised in that the foot section (3) is designed to be essentially tubular 

and the lower leg section (2) is formed from two straps (9) which can be partly 
overlapped and can be made into a tubular shape by means of a rapid closure 

encompassing the bottom lower leg, and in that a stiffening insert (5), which extends 
from the heel region of the foot section (3) to the upper edge (6) of the lower leg 

section (2), lies medially in a textile pocket. 
Ankle joint bandage according to claim 1, in which an elastic belt (7), which can 
be placed in a loop around the foot section (3) and the lower leg section (2) of the 

bandage and can be fixed with tensile stress at its free end (8) by means of a rapid 

closure, is applied medially in the heel region of the foot section (3).
