<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fibrous base material 
comprising fibrillated aramid fibers with low degree of fibrillation, 

synthetic graphite and at least 
one filler material, and a non-asbestos friction material produced 

therefrom. In certain embodiments, the fibrous base material is 
impregnated with a phenolic or phenolic-base resin material, including, 

for example, a mixture of a phenolic resin and a silicone resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fibrous base material comprising
less fibrillated aramid fibers, manufactured or synthetic graphite and a
filler material, such as diatomaceous earth. The invention further relates
to a composite friction material comprising the above described fibrous
base material impregnated with a phenolic resin or a modified phenolic
resin blend. In certain embodiments, at least one silicone resin is blended
with at least one phenolic resin for use in impregnating a fibrous base
material.The friction material of the present invention has higher friction
stability and thermal capability than conventional friction materials. Also,
the resulting friction material is especially useful in high energy
applications.New and advanced transmission systems and braking systems are
being developed by the automotive industry. These new systems often
involve high energy requirements. Therefore, the friction materials
technology must be also developed to meet the increasing energy
requirements of these advanced systems. In particular, a new high energy type friction material is needed.
The new high energy friction material must be able to withstand high
speeds wherein surface speeds are up to about 65m/seconds. Also, the
friction material must be able to withstand high facing lining pressures up
to about 1500 psi. It is also important that the friction material be useful
under limited lubrication conditions.The friction material must have high heat resistance in order to be
useful in the advanced transmission and braking systems. Not only must
the friction material remain stable at high temperatures, it must also be
able to rapidly dissipate the high heat that is being generated during
operating conditions.The high speeds generated during engagement and disengagement
of the new transmission and braking systems mean that a friction
material must be able to maintain a relatively constant friction throughout
the engagement. It is important that the frictional engagement be
relatively constant over a wide range of speeds and temperatures in order
to minimize "shuddering" of materials during braking or the transmission
system during power shift from one gear to another.Previously, asbestos fibers were included in the friction material for
temperature stability. For example, the Arledter et al. U.S. Patent No.
3,270,846 patent describes phenolic and phenolic-modified resins used
with asbestos. Now, however, due to health and environmental
problems, asbestos is no longer being used. More recent
