<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for the joint cracking of hydrocarbon charges (1), especially naphtha, and non hydrogenated C4 fractions (4b) in pyrolysis furnaces to produce olefines, in which the whole of the charge to be cracked is preheated in the convection region of the pyrolysis furnace by the flue gases from the radiant region with the addition of process steam (4a) and then subjected to thermal cracking in the radiant region. According to the invention, the C4 fraction (4b) is not fed into the convection region together with the hydrocarbon charges, as is usual, but is heated in mixture with process steam (4a) in the convection region (9) and then mixed with the hydrocarbon charge (2, 5) and reheated together before being fed into the radiant region (10). The heated mixture of process steam and C4 fraction can be mixed with the hydrocarbon charge at several points. Advantageously, in the process of the invention, superheated process steam is introduced or the process steam in the mixture of it and C4-hydrocarbons is superheated before being mixed with the hydrocarbon charge. Particular advantages are obtained if the C4 fraction amounts to up to 25% wt. and preferably up to 10% wt. of the hydrocarbon charge. The C4 fraction may consist of up to 100% wt., and preferably 30 to 60% wt., of butadiene.

Process for the joint cracking of hydrocarbon 
charges, in particular naphtha, and non-hydrogenated 

C₄ fractions in pyrolysis furnaces for olefin production, 
the charge material to be cracked being preheated in the 

convection zone of the pyrolysis furnace by the flue 
gases from the radiant zone of the pyrolysis furnace with 

addition of process steam and then being subjected to 
thermal cracking in the radiant zone, characterized in 

that the C₄ fraction is mixed with process steam, fed 
into the convection zone, heated there and then mixed 

with the hydrocarbon charge, and is further heated before 

being fed into the radiant zone. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the addition of the already heated mixture of 

process steam and C₄ fraction to the hydrocarbon charge 
or to a mixture of hydrocarbon charge, C₄ fraction and 

process steam is performed at a plurality of points. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the process steam in the mixture of process steam 

and C₄ fraction is superheated before being mixed with 
the hydrocarbon charge or superheated process steam is 

mixed with the C₄ fraction. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the C₄ fraction contains up to 25% by weight, 

preferably up to 10% by weight, of the hydrocarbon 
charge. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the C₄ fraction comprises up to 

100% by weight, preferably from 30 to 60% by weight, 
butadiene.  

 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that process steam is partially or 

completely replaced as diluent by substances decreasing 
the partial pressure such as methane, ethane and/or 

propane.
