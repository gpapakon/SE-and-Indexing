<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for making leaktight walls in the ground, of the type in which a pile is driven vertically into the ground along the path of the wall to be produced, by vibration, and raised back up, injecting, at low pressure, at the base of the pile, a conventional slurry and a jet of very high pressure liquid substantially in the plane of the wall and in the direction of the part of the wall to be produced. As the pile (1) is raised back up, a jet of very high pressure liquid directed towards that part (2) of the wall which has already been produced is sent to the bottom part of this pile, the very high pressure liquid which is sent to the lower part of the pile as it is lowered and as it is raised back up consists of a fluid slurry based on water, bentonite, additives, and cement, while a thick conventional slurry based on water, bentonite, cement, additives and an aggregate which gives it its consistency is injected at the base (6) of the pile as it is lowered and raised back up.

Method for producing impermeable walls in the ground,
of the type in which a sheet pile is driven vertically by

vibration into the ground and raised therefrom along the
path of the wall to be produced, injecting at low pressure,

at the base of the sheet pile, a conventional grout which
constitutes, after injection, the thin wall, a jet of liquid

at very high pressure substantially in the plane of the wall
and in the direction of the part of the wall to be produced,

and a jet of liquid at very high pressure in the direction
of the part (2) of the wall which has already been produced,

characterized in that the liquid at very high pressure which
is directed at the lower part of the sheet pile during its

lowering and during its raising consists of a fluid grout
based on water, on bentonite, on admixtures and on cement,

whereas a thick conventional grout based on water, on
bentonite, on cement, on admixtures and on an aggregate

which gives it its consistency is injected at the base (6)
of the sheet pile, above the injection of the liquid at very

high pressure, during its lowering and its raising, in that
the jet at very high pressure directed towards the part of

the wall already produced is sent only during the raising of
the sheet pile and the jet of fluid grout, which, during the

lowering of the sheet pile, is injected at very high
pressure, is slightly inclined downwards.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
jet of fluid grout is inclined downwards by 8 to 20%.
