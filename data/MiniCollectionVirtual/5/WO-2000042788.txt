<ABSTRACT>
The history of the zone to which a mobile communication terminal is handed over is stored in a handover history storage unit (41a). The history of the past successive five handovers to the zones including the zone to which the mobile communication terminal is handed over is judged every handover with reference to the handover history storage unit (41a). If any of the zones is stored in the handover history storage unit (41a), the mobile communication terminal is recognized to be in a stationary state, or otherwise in a moving state. According to the results of the recognition, a search algorithm suitable for the state of the mobile station is selected to search for a base station. Thus the power consumption in a waiting state is reduced and as a result the battery life is prolonged.
