<ABSTRACT>
A cover, to which an annular filter insert that separates the outer inlet space from the inner outlet space is releasably fastened, is screwed onto the approximately vertical filter housing of the oil filter for purifying lubricating oil. Provided in the bottom region of the filter housing is an element which has a valve-type action. This opens automatically each time the filter insert is changed and serves to drain off any oil that remains in the filter housing via a drain passage to an oil-collecting space. The intention is to improve the construction of an oil filter of this kind by connecting a central rod to the cover in a manner which allows the said rod to be rotated and to be displaced axially to a limited extent, the rod having, in the region near to the cover, a piston-like thickened portion which is sealed off relative to the filter insert and separates the inlet space from the outlet space. In addition, the central rod has in its bottom end region the element with the valve-like action which interacts with the drain passage.

Oil filter for the cleaning of lubricating oil, 
in particular for internal combustion engines of motor 

vehicles, with a filter housing with a cap connectable 
with the latter by screwing, said housing being arranged 

at least approximately upright in the installed condition, 
and with a ring-shaped filter insert detachably connectable 

with said cap, which filter insert, at the end disposed 
opposite the cap, is tightly seated radially on the inside 

in a sliding seat on a nipple rigidly joined with the 
housing, whereby in the filter housing, provision is made 

for an oil inlet for contaminated oil to the feed-to space 
surrounding the filter insert, and for an oil outlet for 

cleaned oil from the flow-off space formed by the interior 
space of the filter insert, and whereby, furthermore, 

provision is made in the lower zone of the filter housing 
for a discharge duct connected with an oil-collecting 

space for oil remaining in the filter housing when the 
filter insert is changed, said discharge duct being 

automatically opened by a valve-like acting member with 
each change of the filter insert, but is constantly closed 

off as for the rest, characterized in that a center bar (3) 
is connected with the cap (2) with limited axial 

displaceability, said bar, in its zone close to the cap,  
 

having a piston-like thickening (6) resting radially 
tightly against the falter insert (14) in a sliding 

seat, against which thickening the filter insert (14) 
rests radially tightly in a sliding seat, said thickening 

separating the flow-to space (7) from the flow-off space 
(8) and having in its lower end zone a valve-like 

acting member cooperating with the discharge duct (11). 
Oil filter according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the cap (2) is turnable against the center bar (3). 
Oil filter according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the limited axial displaceability of the center 

bar (3) against the cap (2) is realized by arrests (4) 
in said two parts (2, 3), said arrests engaging each other, 

and by a stroke limiter (5) provided on one of said two 
parts (2, 3), said limiter being directed against the other 

of said two parts (3, 2). 
Oil filter according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that provision is made for at least one 

pressure spring (17) between the cap (2) and the center 
bar (3).  

 
Oil filter according to claim 4, characterized 
in that a pressure spring (17) is arranged coaxially with 

the center bar (3) within the zone of the thickening (6), 
said pressure spring enclosing the stroke limiter (5) and 

being enclosed by the arrests (4). 
Oil filter according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that on its inner circumference, the 
filter insert (14) is provided with a supporting ring (15) 

supporting itself on an inner cylindrical supporting body 
(16), the latter being fastened in the lower part of the 

filter housing (1) by a snap connection (18). 
Oil filter according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the filter housing (1) is 

designed as a cast aluminum part, the cap (2) as an 
injection-molded plastic part, and the center bar (3) 

with the thickening (6) and the valve-like member (9) as 
a molded plastic part.
