<ABSTRACT>
Treatment of cells or humans carrying or infected with a virus capable of causing an immunodeficiency disease with compounds of formula (I), wherein R, R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, noncyclic heteroalkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, provided at least two of the substituents of R, R1 and R2 are other than hydrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF HUMAN VIRAL INFECTIONSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/933,460, filed on August 21, 1992.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, also referred to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV) and, to a lesser extent, human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related disorders. Barre-Sinoussi, et al. , Science. 220:868-871 (1983); Gallo, et al. , Science. 224:500-503 (1984); Levy, et al. , Science. Ill'-840-842 (1984); Popovic, et al., Science. 224:497-500 (1984); Sarngadharan, et al. , Science. 224:506-508 (1984); Siegal, et al., N. Engl. J. Med.. 305:1439-1444 (1981); Clavel, F. , AIDS. 1:135-140. This disease is characterized by a long asymptomatic period followed by the progressive degeneration of the immune system and the central nervous system. Studies of the virus indicate that replication is highly regulated, and both latent and lytic infection of the CD4 positive helper subset of T-lymphocytes occur in tissue culture. Zagury, et al., Science. 231:850-853 (1986). The expression of the virus in infected patients also appears to be regulated as the titer of infectious virus remains low throughout the course of the disease. Both HIV-1 and 2 share a similar structural and function genomic organization, having 

regulatory genes such as tat, rev, nef. in addition to structural genes such as env. gag and pol.While AIDS, itself, does not necessarily cause death, in many individuals the immune system is so severely depressed that various other diseases (secondary infections or unusual tumors) such as herpes, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma and Epstein-Barr virus related lymphomas among others occur, which ultimately results in death. These secondary infections may be treated using other medications. However, such treatment can be adversely affected by the weakened immune system. Some humans infected with the AIDS virus seem to live many years with little or no symptoms, but appear to have persistent infections. Another group of humans suffers mild immune system depression with various symptoms such as weight loss, malaise, fever and swollen lymph nodes. These syndromes have been called persistent generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome (PGL) and AIDS related complex (ARC) and may or may not develop into AIDS. In all cases, those infected with the HIV are believed to be persistently infective to others.The activation of the latent HIV provirus from the

What is claimed is:
1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective antiviral treatment amount of a compound of formula I

 wherein R, R-, and R are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, noncyclic heteroalkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, provided at least two of the substituents of R, R-i and R2 are other than hydrogen, adapted for treating a mammal having an immunodeficiency virus .
2. A method of inhibiting or reducing the expression of genes operably linked to a LTR of an immunodeficiency virus which comprises administering an effective gene expression reduction amount of a compound of the formula I:
wherein R, R-*_ and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, noncyclic heteroalkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted 


alkenyl, provided at least two of the substituents of R, R-, and R2 are other than hydrogen.
3. A method for treating cells infected with a virus capable of causing an immunodeficiency disease in a human, comprising administering to the cells an effective antiviral treatment amount of a compound of the following formula I:
wherein R, Ri and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, noncyclic heteroalkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, provided at least two of the substituents of R, R-, and R2 are other than hydrogen.
4. A method of treating humans having an immunodeficiency disease, wherein the immunodeficiency disease is resistant to a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, comprising administering to said human an effective immunodeficiency disease treatment amount of a compound of the following
*
 formula I: *
wherein R, R-, and Ro are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted 


alkyl, noncyclic heteroalkyl, and substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, provided at least two of the substituents of R, R-, and R2 are other than hydrogen.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the cell line is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant cell line.
