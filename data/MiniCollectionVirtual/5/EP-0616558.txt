Use of two aqueous baths, which are adapted to each 
other, for coating electrically non-conductive substrate 

surfaces by a substrate-induced coagulation with solid 
particles of materials, selected from the group consisting of 

carbon, SiO
2
, MoS
2
 and H
x
WO
3
, by pretreating the substrate 
in a first bath, which contains high-molecular 

polyelectrolytes, which are dissolved in polar solvents, 
are substantially soluble in water and are suitable for 

adsorption on the substrate as coagulation initiators, and 
by a subsequent treatment in a second bath, which contains 

a low-viscous dispersion of polar solvents, the solid 
particles and surfactant stabilisers in a quantity which 

just stabilises the dispersion, as well as electrolytes, 
the electrolytes being salts which destabilise the 

dispersion and, during the treatment in the second bath, 
cause an irreversible, rinse-resistant local coagulation of 

the solid particles on the substrate surface. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
rinsing process with water is interposed between the 

treatment processes. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the solid particles are electron-conductive. 
Use according to claim 3, characterised in that 
electron-conductive solid particles are deposited in 

preparation for electrodeposition. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the high-molecular substances contained in the 

preliminary immersion solution are selected from the group 
of water-soluble proteins and polysaccharides as well as 

natural substances related thereto.  
 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the high-molecular substances contained in the 

preliminary immersion solution are synthetic polymers or 
polycondensates with the dipolar nature of monomeric units. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the high-molecular substances contained in the 

preliminary immersion solution are polyelectrolytes with a 
positive or negative charge, or respectively so-called 

betaines which simultaneously carry positive and negative 
charges. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the sedimentation-preventing surfactants contained in 

the second solution are selected from the group of anionic, 
cationic, ambivalent or uncharged surfactants. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the finely divided solid particles contained in the 

second solution are formed from graphite or carbon black. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the salts, contained in the second solution and 

intended for the appropriate destabilisation, are selected 
from the group of halides, borates, carbonates, nitrates, 

phosphates, sulphates and chlorates of inorganic, singly-, 
doubly- and triply-positively charged cations. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the substrates which are to be deposited with the 

solid particles are formed from synthetic resins or 
respectively synthetic resin composite materials. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
synthetic resins are epoxy resins, polyimide resins or 

Teflon, and the synthetic resin composite materials are 
synthetic resins reinforced with glass fibres.  

 
Use according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the electron-conductive solid particles are applied in 

preparation for the electroplating of drill holes in 
printed circuit boards or related electronic components. 
Use according to claim 3, 4 or 11, characterised in 
that the printed circuit boards are multilayer printed 

circuit boards. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
preliminary immersion solution is mixed with a 

bactericidally acting substance.
