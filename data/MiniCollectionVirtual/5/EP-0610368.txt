<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of the ornithine
decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitors for the treatment of acne and
pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).Although the exact mechanisms leading to acne are not
known, antiandrogens, retinoic acid, steroids and antibiotics, inter alia
have generally been proposed for its treatment, as described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,139,638; 4,161,540; 4,191,775; 4,344,943; and West
German OLS no. 2,840,144.PFB relates to the removal of hair by shaving or plucking. It
has been treated by procedures such as the use of electric clippers or
depilatories for hair removal, or by topical treatment with tretinoin (Retin-A),
benzoyl peroxide, chlorohydroxyquinoline, chloroalkylphenols,
phospholipids in combination with wheat germ oil and vitamin E, alpha-hydroxy
acids, salicylic acid in combination with glucocorticoids and
sulfur as shown for example in U.S. patents 4,228,163, 4,463,016;
4,525,344; 4,775,530; and 4,944,939; and in Klingman et al., Arch.
Dermatol., vol. 107, 551-52 (1973).Many of the treatments for PFB, and particularly for acne,
produce such serious side effects that the treatment can be justified only
in the most severe cases; other treatments are of limited effectiveness. According to the present invention there is provided the
use of an inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase for the
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis
barbae.Also, according to the present invention there is provided the
use of 2-(difluoromethyl)-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid for the manufacture
of a medicament for the treatment of acne.US-A-4786651 discloses the use of manoalide for the
treatment of acne.US-A-4720489 discloses that the compound
2-(difluoromethyl)-2, 5-diaminopentanoic acid has ornithine decarboxylase
inhibiting activity. The compound 2-(difluoromethyl) ornithine (DFMO, 2-difluoromethyl-2.5-diaminopentanoic
acid) and other inhibitors of ornithine dicarboxylase have been
proposed for use in treating cancer and certain non-malignant diseases such as
erythroderma, psoriasis, and some forms of dermatitis, etc. as described in Splinter et
al., Eur. J. Cancer and Clin. Oncology, Vol. 22:I-E, 61-67 (1985); McCullough et al. J.
Investig. Dermatology, Vol. 85, 518-521 (1985); McCullough et al., J. Investig.
Dermatology, Vol. 81, 388-392 (1983); Kousa et al., Acta Dermatovener (Stockholm)
Vol. 62, 221-224 (1982); and U.S. Patent 4,207,315.It has now been found that topical administration of a cytostatic nontoxic
agent such as
