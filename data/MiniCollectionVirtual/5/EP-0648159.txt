<DESCRIPTION>
 MANUFACTURE OF A COMPOSITE MATERIALThe present invention relates to apparatus for and a method of manufacturing a composite material such as, for example, a composite material particularly suitable for forming the outer surface material of an aircraft.The term ■■material" includes any suitable component or structure, such as for example a laminate joint, depending on the application of the invention.A previously proposed composite material has been manufactured by embedding high strength fibres having a high modulus of elasticity within a homogeneous matrix. In one example of such a material, the fibres are made of carbon, aramid or boron, and the matrix can be formed of material such as an epoxy, bismalemide or polyimide resin.The fibres are supplied in a uni-directional, woven or fibrous mat format which is pre-impregnated with slightly cured resin to form an intermediate fabric material. This intermediate fabric material is flexible and tacky, and the positions of the fibre filaments therein are not fixed. Layers of these intermediate fabric materials are assembled one upon the other in a mould, and then compressed and heated. The heating action accelerates the curing of the resin, and the combination of the heating and compression joins together the intermediate fabric materials to form the composite material.In our co-pending patent application publication No. GB2238977A there is disclosed a method of manufacturing a composite material comprising placing together face to face a plurality of layers of intermediate fabric 

material, each layer comprising high strength fibres have a high modulus of elasticity in a tacky homogeneous resin matrix, fastening together said layers at spaced locations thereon, and then compressing and heating the layer assembly to cure the resin.The present invention is particularly concerned with apparatus for and a method of fastening together the layers of intermediate fabric material at spaced locations thereon.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for fastening together a plurality of layers of intermediate fabric material located in a stack, . said apparatus comprising first means to make a passage through the stack, second means to draw a loop of prepared material through the passage to extend from both faces of the stack, third means to cut the loop at a pre¬ selected distance from one face of the stack to form two independent pieces of prepared material, and means to fold back the end portions of each piece onto the opposite faces

CLAIMS;
1. Apparatus for fastening together a plurality of layers of intermediate fabric material located in a stack (2) , said apparatus comprising first means to make a passage (14) through the stack (2) , second means to draw a loop (18) of prepared material through the passage to extend from both faces of the stack (2) , third means to cut the loop at a pre-selected distance from one face (13) of the stack, to form two independent pieces of prepared material (20,22), and means to fold back the end portions of each piece onto the opposite faces (13,16) of the stack (2) to extend away from the other piece.
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said first means is a first knife blade (4) .
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that said second means is said first knife blade (4) .
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that said first knife blade (4) has an aperture (8) therethrough to receive said loop (18) .
5. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that said third means is a second knife blade (10) having its cutting edge (12) located at said preselected distance from said one face (13) of the stack (2).
6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that said blades (4,10) are in sliding contact with one another.
7. A method of fastening together a plurality of layers of intermediate fabric material located in the stack (2) , said method comprising making a passage (14) through the 


stack, drawing a loop (18) of prepared material through the passage to extend from both faces (13,16) of the stack (2) , cutting the loop at a pre-selected distance from one face (13) of the stack to form two independent pieces of prepared material (20,22), and folding back the end portions of each piece onto the opposite faces of the stack to extend away from the other piece.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7 characterised in that the length of the loop (18) and the said pre-selected distance are arranged so that the two independent pieces (20,22) each project an equal distance from opposite faces of the stack (2) .
9. A method as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, further including placing at least one additional layer of intermediate fabric material over the folded back end portions on each face of the stack (2) .
10. A method as claimed in claim 7 or claim 9, further including repeating said operations at required spaced locations from one another.
11. A method as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 10 further including curing the fastened layers.
