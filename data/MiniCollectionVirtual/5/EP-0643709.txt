<DESCRIPTION>
 4-(1-H-PYRROL-l-YL) IMIDAZOLES WITH ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONIST ACTIVITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel substituted derivatives of 4—(lH-pyrrol—1- yl)imidazoles which are useful as pharmaceutical agents, to methods for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions which include the compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and to pharmaceutical methods of treatment as well as the use of these agents as diagnostic tools. The novel compounds of the present invention are antagonists of angiotensin II (All) useful in controlling hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, postsurgical vascular restenosis, renal failure, and glaucoma in mammals. The enzyme renin acts on a blood plasma α2-globulin, angiotensinogen, to produce angiotensin I, which is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme to All. The latter substance is a powerful vasopressor agent which has been implicated as a causative agent for producing high blood pressure in various mammals, such as rats, dogs, and humans. Angiotensin II has also been found to stimulate vascular hyperplasia as reported by W. Osterrieder, et al (Hypertension 18[suppl II]:II60- 1164, 1991); H. Azuma, et al (Jpn. J. Pharmacol.52(4) .541-552, 1990); and S. Laporte, et al (FASEB 5(4), Part I: A869, 1991). The compounds of this invention inhibit the action of All at its receptors on target cells and thus prevent the increase in 

 blood pressure produced by this hormone-receptor interaction. By administering a compound of the instant invention to a species of mammal with hypertension due to All, the blood pressure is reduced. The compounds of the invention are also useful for the treatment of congestive heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, atherosclerosis, postsurgical vascular restenosis, and glaucoma.European Patent Application 0253310 discloses angiotensin II receptor blocking imidazoles of the formulaEuropean Patent Application 0291969 disclose tetrazole intermediates to antihypertensive compounds

39. A process according to Claim 37 wherein in Step 2 a 4-amino—2,5-disubstituted imidazole is heated with a 2, 5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran 


 derivative in buffered acetic acid to produce a substituted 4- (IH-pyrrol-l-yl)imidazole.
40. A process according to Claim 37 wherein methyl 4-amino-2-propylimidazole-5-carboxylate is heated with 2, 5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in buffered acetic acid to produce methyl 2-propyl- 4-(lll-pyrrol-l-yl)imidazole-5-carboxylate.
41. A process according to Claim 37, Step 2 which comprises treating a 4— (IH-pyrrol—1-yl) imidazole from Step 1 with an electrophilic reagent selected from sulfuryl chloride, nitric acid, N-chlorosuccinimide, chlorine, N-bromosuccinamide, bromine, iodine, trichloroacetylchloride, and trifluoroacetic anhydride.
42. A process according to Claim 37, for the preparation of methyl 2-propyl-4 [2- (l-oxo-2,2,2- trifluoroethyl)-IH-pyrrol-l-yl]imidazole-5- carboxylate which comprises treating methyl 2-propyl-4- (IH-pyrrol-1-yl) imidazole) -5- carboxylate with trifluoroacetic anhydride in an aprotic solvent.
43. A process according to Claim 37 which comprises alkylation of a 4-(IH-pyrrol-l-yl)imidazole derivative with a (biphen-4-yl)methyl reagent in the presence of a base to produce a substituted 1- (biphen-4-yl)methyl-4- (lH-pyrrol-1- yl) imidazole derivative that is subsequently treated to remove common protecting groups to produce a compound of Formula I. 


44. A process according to Claim 37, Step 4 which comprises reacting methyl 2-propyl-4 [2-(l-oxo- 2, 2,2-trifluoroethyl) —IH-pyrrol-l-yl] imidazole- 5-carboxylate with N—triphenylmethyl-5-[4'- (bromoethyl)biphen-2—yl]
tetrazole and cesium carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide solution to produce methyl 4-[2—(l-oxo-2,2,2-trifluoro¬ ethyl) -IH-pyrrol-l-yl] -2-propyl-l-[ (2'- (N-triphenylmethyltetrazol-5-yl)biρhen-4- yl)methyl]
—lH-imidazole-5-carboxylate, which is subsequently deprotected by treating first with acid and then with base and water to give 4-[2-(l-oxo-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) -lH-ρyrrol-1- yl]-2-propyl-l-[2'-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl)biphen-4- yl)methyl-lH-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid.
