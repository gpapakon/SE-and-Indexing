<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tube picker for picking out unfilled tubes which are to be filled with some mass, such as creams or the like. The tube picker comprises rigidly fixed fingers (5) on a movable support (7) intended to be inserted into the unfilled tubes (2) through their open bottoms and it is characterized in that on the support (7) in the vicinity of the rigidly fixed fingers (5) pins (10) have been mounted movable in relation to the fixed fingers intended to be put on the fingers (5) after they have been inserted into the tubes (2) and therethrough clamp these.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube picker for picking 
unfilled tubes having an open bottom from a container such 
as a cardboard box or the like to be placed on a band which 
is intended to transport the picked tubes to a filling 
station for these. Within the packing industry machines for handling, filling 
and sealing of usual squeezing tubes have got a high degree 
of mechanising. Empty tubes having an open bottom are 
supplied in boxes to a tube filling machine at which these 
empty tubes automatically are picked up and placed on a 
moving line to the filling machine. Immediately before the 
filling machine the empty tubes are sucked clean from 
possible impurities. A plurality of devices for picking empty tubes from boxes 
are known. A prior system is based on that one uses picking 
fingers which are provided with friction organs which are 
introduced into and act against the inner side of the empty 
tube. Different variants of these friction organs are 
known, but common for them is that rubber details are used 
which are subjected to wearing and aging so that they have 
to be replaced from time to time. Via the fact that these 
picking fingers require relatively exact guidance in 
relation to the empty tubes for having the picking fingers  
 
to hit the accurate positioning of every empty tube is 
required. A more recent device for picking tubes from boxes is 
described in SE-B-449 733. This system is 
based on using picking fingers which are hollow and at one 
end provided with a suction orifice. The picking fingers 
are connected to a fan which sucks air from them so that 
when the picking fingers are inserted into the tubes they 
will be sucked on the picking fingers. The tubes are 
thereafter lifted from the box and forwarded to for example 
a running conveyor where they are laid down either by 
having the tubes pushed off by means of an abutment or by 
taking away the subatmospheric pressure. A further example of a tube picking arrangement is 
described in the British patent 2.203.404. The device 
according to this patent does also use picking fingers, but 
these are movable to the sides and they pick up the tubes 
by clamping the tubes against each other after the fingers 
have been introduced in the tubes and in this way pinch the 
tubes. The fingers in this device act in pairs and they are 
connected to each other by means of a spring which pulls 
them against each other. This also requires an arrangement 
which moves the fingers apart before the insertion in the 
tubes. The

<CLAIMS>
Tube picker for picking of unfilled tubes (2) having 
an open bottom from a container (1) and putting these on a 

conveyor (6) or the like comprising rigidly fixed fingers 
(5) on a movable support (7) intended to be inserted into 

the unfilled tubes (2) through their open bottoms, 

characterized in
 that the support (7) in the 
vicinity of the rigidly fixed fingers (5) in relation to 

these carries movably mounted pins (10) intended to be put 
on the fingers (5) after the latter having been inserted into the 

tubes (2) and thereby clamp these, each pin (10) being 
intended to be placed against two fingers (5). 
Tube picker according to the claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that the pins (10) are mounted above 
and between the fingers (5). 
Tube picker according to any of the claims 1-2, 

characterized in
 that the movably mounted 
pins (10) are mounted on a turnable shaft (9) whereby they 

through turning of this will be swingable against and from 
the fingers (5).
