 SOLID DISPERSION COMPOSITIONS OF TEBUFELONETECHNICAL FIELD The subject invention involves novel pharmaceutical composi¬ tions containing tebufelone, a di-tert-butylphenol anti-inflam¬ matory compound. More particul rly, it involves such composi- tions dosed perorally which provide good bioavailability of the compound.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCertain substituted di-tert-butylphenol derivatives are known to be effective as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or antipyretic agents. Of particular interest regarding the subject invention is tebufelone, 1-3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy- phenyl-5-hexyn-l-one disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,708,966 issued to Loomans, Matthews & Miller on November 24, 1987. (The compound is termed 4-(5'-hexynoyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol therein.) Related compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,846,303 issued to Loomans, Matthews & Miller on July 11, 1989 and U.S. Patent No.4,849,428 issued to Dobson, Loomans, Matthews& Miller on July 18, 1989. Certain compositions of tebufelone are disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0,431,659 of Kelm & Bruns published June 12, 1991.It is an object of the subject invention to provide solid dispersion pharmaceutical compositions for peroral administration of tebufelone which provide good bioavailability of the compound.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention relates to compositions in dosage form comprising a solid dispersion which is a solidified melt mixture consisting essentially of the following components:(a) from about 15% to about 75% of tebufelone;(b) from about 25% to about 65% of a poloxamer surfactant having a melting point of about 40*C or greater, the poloxamer surfactant consisting essentially of a block copolymer having three polymer blocks, a middle block of poly(oxypropylene) with a molecular weight of from 

 about 1450 daltons to about 6000 daltons, and end blocks of poly(oxyethylene), the end blocks being from about 50% to about 90% of the copolymer; and (c) from 0% to about 60% of other components, wherein the other components are miscible with a melt mixture of components (a) and (b).DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The drug active of interest regarding the subject invention is 1-3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl-5-hexyn-1-one having the chemical structure:
 which is referred to herein as tebufelone. A method of synthesizing tebufelone is disclosed in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,708,966, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The subject invention involves pharmaceutical
