<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method have been conceived for using a digital audio tape 
(DAT) in an audio logger for the purposes of storing and retrieving audio data. This 

is accomplished in a manner such that the data is received and recorded in a time 
related manner. Provision is made for accommodating the transfer drive rate of the 

DAT through use of a buffer between the signal processor of the logger and the 
DAT. In addition, the method of storing the data results in greater use of the 

available space on the DAT as the DAT tape only writes for those periods when 
audio is present on a channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
Audio loggers are known devices that are used for the purpose of obtaining
records of voice communication. They have particular use in police stations;
hospitals, prisons, brokerage houses and other locations where there is a need to
record a conversation or other audio and the time and date thereof. The tapes upon
which audio is written are stored for archival. purposes. Prior loggers were based on
continuous, real time analogue voice signal processing. Although analog loggers
worked well, they have the disadvantage of requiring large amounts of tape space
for storing audio.Recently, digital loggers that use digital audio tapes (DATs) have become
commercially available. Although these digital audio loggers offer advantages over
prior analog loggers in terms of space requirements, they have certain drawbacks.
One problem found with prior digital audio loggers is that the DATs do not provide
an efficient time related scheme whereby conversations which took place at a
particular time can be quickly and reliably retrieved. Another disadvantage is that
the prior digital audio loggers do not utilize the maximum amount of recording space
available on the DATs. Still another disadvantage of prior digital audio loggers is
that the DAT drives used with such loggers experience greater wear because of
their use whether or not audio is being written.US-A-4,873,589 discloses a data streamer and method in which a data recorder is
operated continuously even when the supply of incoming data to be recorded is
interrupted.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of
storing audio, comprising:
receiving audio from an audio source;compressing the audio; andstoring the compressed audio in a buffer, retrieving the compressed audio from
the buffer and writing the compressed audio onto a digital audio tape from the buffer; the
method being characterised by: 
recording the time audio is written into the digital audio tape, and writing a
plurality of filemarks onto the digital audio tape and defining a fixed period between the
filemarks; and following each filemark by at least one data group with each data group
composed of a plurality of audio blocks, wherein each audio block represents a
respective channel for receiving audio.According to a second aspect of the present invention there is also provided a
system for processing audio, comprising:
an interface for receiving audio from an audio source;a digital signal processor in communication with the interface for compressing
the audio

<CLAIMS>
A method of storing audio, comprising:

receiving audio from an audio source (12);
compressing the audio; and
storing the compressed audio in a buffer (22), retrieving the compressed audio
from the buffer (22) and writing the compressed audio onto a digital audio tape (26) from

the buffer; the method being 
characterised by
:

recording the time audio is written into the digital audio tape (26), and writing a
plurality of filemarks (34) onto the digital audio tape (26) and defining a fixed period

between the filemarks (34); and following each filemark (34) by at least one data group
(36) with each data group (38) composed of a plurality of audio blocks, wherein each

audio block represents a respective channel for receiving audio.
The method of claim 1 further including the step of only storing active audio on
the digital audio tape (26) whereby storage space on the DAT (26) is consumed only for

active audio.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 further including the step of following each
filemark (34) with a header (36) having a group map (42) that indicates the activity of

audio written in the audio blocks proceeding the next filemark (34).
The method of claim 3 including the further steps of writing on the digital audio
tape (26) an accumulated table and including in the accumulated table data from the

group maps (42) of the headers (36).
The method of any preceding claim further including writing on the digital audio
tape (26) a record session table (73) including a beginning time (74) and final time (76)

of a record session. 
The method of claim 5 wherein the record session table (73) contains a plurality
of record sessions, the beginning time (74) of each record session, the final time (76) of

each record session, and the number (80) of the filemark at the beginning of each session.
A system (10) for processing audio, comprising:

an interface (14) for receiving audio from an audio source (12);
a digital signal processor (18) in communication with the interface (14) for
compressing the audio signals;
a converter (16) intermediate said interface (14) and said digital signal processor
(18) for converting audio signals from analogue to digital and transmitting digital signals

to said digital signal processor (18);
a controller (20) in communication with the digital signal processor (18) for
receiving audio therefrom and arranging data in a prescribed order;
a buffer (22) in communication with the controller (20) for receiving arranged
audio from the controller (20); and
a digital audio tape drive (24) in communication with the buffer (22) for receiving
arranged audio from the buffer (22) and writing the arranged audio on a digital audio tape

(26) driven by said digital audio tape drive (24);

   
characterised in that
 said digital audio tape (26) defines a plurality of filemarks
(34), each filemark (34) dividing the digital audio tape (26) into fixed periods.
The system of claim 7 further including a speaker (17) in communication with
said interface (14), said converter (16) having means for converting digital signals

received from said digital signal processor (18) to analogue signals, wherein said
interface (14) is operable to send analogue signals to said speaker (17).
The system of claim 7 or 8 wherein each of said filemarks (34) is followed by at
least one group (38) containing a plurality of audio blocks and each audio block contains

audio from a designated channel of an audio source (12).
