<ABSTRACT>
A powdery α-alumina comprising single-crystal α-alumina grains which are homogeneous and free from any crystal seed 
inside, form an at least eight-sided polyhedron, and have a D to H ratio of 0.5 to 3.0 (wherein D is the maximum grain diameter 

in parallel with the hexagonal lattice plane of the α-alumina having a hexagonal closest lattice structure and H is the grain diameter 
perpendicular to the hexagonal lattice plane thereof), a number-average grain diameter of 0.1 to 5 µm and a narrow grain size 

distribution. The powdery α-alumina of the invention comprises single-crystal 
α-alumina grains which are nearly spherical, fine 

and structurally homogeneous and have a narrow grain size distribution, and is suitable as the raw materials of abrasive, sinter, 
plasma spraying material, filler, single crystal, catalyst support, phosphor, sealing material and ceramic filter, in particular, as the 

raw materials of precision abrasive, sinter and ceramic filter, thus being remarkably useful from the industrial viewpoint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to α-alumina. α-Alumina
powder has been widely used as an abrasive, a raw material
for sintered products, a plasma spraying material, a filler
and the like. The α-alumina of the present invention
comprises α-alumina single crystal particles which are not
agglomerated particles and have high purity, structural
homogeneity, and a narrow particle size distribution, and is
of high industrial use as an abrasive, a raw material for
sintered products, a plasma spraying material, a filler, a
starting material for single crystals, a raw material for a
carrier for catalysts, a raw material for fluorescent
substances, a raw material for encapsulations, a raw material
for ceramic filters, etc. It is particularly useful as a
precision abrasive, a raw material for sintered products, and
a raw material for ceramic filters.α-Alumina powder obtained by conventional processes
comprises irregular-shaped polycrystals, contains many
agglomerates, and has a broad particle size distribution.
For some uses, the purity of these conventional species is
insufficient. In order to eliminate these problems, 
α-alumina powder produced by special processes as hereinafter
described has been employed for specific uses. However,
these special processes still fail to arbitrarily control the
shape or particle diameter of α-alumina powder. It has thus
been difficult to obtain α-alumina powder having a narrow
particle size distribution.Known special processes for producing α-alumina
powder include a process utilizing a hydrothermal reaction of
aluminum hydroxide (hereinafter referred to as hydrothermal
treatment process); a process comprising adding a flux to
aluminum oxide, fusing, and precipitating (hereinafter
referred to as flux process); and a process in which aluminum
hydroxide is calcined in the presence of a mineralizer.With respect to a hydrothermal treatment process,
JP-B-57-22886 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined published Japanese patent application") discloses a
process in which corundum is added as a seed crystal to
control the particle size. The process consists of synthesis
in a high temperature under a high pressure, making the
resulting α-alumina powder expensive.According to the study by Matsui, et al.
(Hydrothermal Hannou (Hydrothermal Reactions), Vol. 2, pp.
71-78 "Growth of Alumina Single Crystal by Hydrothermal
Methods"), an α-alumina single crystal obtained by growth of
an alumina single crystal containing chromium on a sapphire
(α-alumina) seed crystal by a hydrothermal growth
