<ABSTRACT>
The present invention has enabled to solve various
problems associated with the optical recording medium of phase

change type when high density recording is conducted by
reducing the record marks. Provided is an optical recording

method for an optical recording medium having a recording layer
of phase change type wherein amorphous record marks are formed

in the recording layer by irradiating the medium with a
recording beam which is power-modulated between high power and

low power. In this method, minimum record marks are formed
such that at least a part of the rear end protrudes toward the

forward end of the mark.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for recording an
optical recording medium of phase change type.Highlight is recently focused on optical recording media
capable of recording information at a high density and erasing
the recorded information for overwriting. One typical
overwritable optical recording medium is phase change optical
recording medium wherein a laser beam is directed to the
recording layer to change its crystalline state whereupon a
change in reflectance by the crystallographic change is
detected for reading of the information. The phase change
optical recording media are of great interest since the medium
can be overwritten by modulating the intensity of a single laser
beam and the optical system of the drive unit is simple as
compared to magnetooptical recording media.Most optical recording media of phase change type used
chalcogenide systems such as Ge-Te system and Ge-Sb-Te system
which provide a substantial difference in reflectance between
crystalline and amorphous states and have a relatively stable
amorphous state. It was also recently proposed to use new
compounds known as chalcopyrites. Chalcopyrite compounds
have been investigated as compound semiconductor materials and
have been applied to solar batteries and the like. The
chalcopyrite compounds are composed of Ib-IIIb-VIb or
IIb-IVb-Vb as expressed in terms of the Groups of the Periodic
Table and have two stacked diamond structures. The structure
of chalcopyrite compounds can be readily determined by X-ray
structural analysis arid their basic characteristics are
described, for example, in Physics, Vol. 8, No. 8 (1987), pp.
441 and Denki Kagaku (Electrochemistry), Vol. 56, No. 4 (1988), 
pp. 228. Among the chalcopyrite compounds, AgInTe is known
to be applicable as a recording material by diluting it with
Sb or Bi. The resulting optical recording media are generally
operated at a linear velocity of about 7 m/s. See Japanese
Patent Application Kokai Nos. (JP-A) 240590/1991, 99884/1991,
82593/1991, 73384/1991, and 151286/1992. In addition to the
optical recording media of phase change type wherein
chalcopyrite compounds are used, optical recording media of
phase change type wherein AgSbTe2 phase is formed with the
crystallization of the recording layer is disclosed in JP-A
267192/1992, 232779/1992, and 166268/1994.When information is recorded on the optical recording
medium of phase change type, the entire recording layer is first
brought into crystalline state, and then, a laser beam of high
power (recording power) is applied so
