<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft system for an automotive vehicle, preferably constructed as an immobiliser, which has an immobiliser unit (5) which compares signals (S1) arriving from a read device (12) with stored data and when they do not correspond outputs inhibit signals (S2) to at least one of the control devices (2) inside the vehicle, which control devices (2) inhibit the transmission of actuation signals for functions which are essential to operation. According to the invention, the said immobiliser is connected to at least one of the control devices (2) via a data lane (3) which can already be used for other purposes.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-theft system, in particular designed as a lock to prevent automotive vehicles being
driven away, which communicates with at least one control device (2) and has an immobiliser

(5) which compares incoming signals (S1) with stored data and, in the event of there being
insufficient match, outputs locking signals (S2) to the control device (2), in particular to the

control device of a prime mover, which locking signals within this control device prevent the
transfer of control signals for functions necessary to operation, wherein the immobiliser (5)

communicates with the control device by way of a data line (3) which is already present and is
used for other purposes, characterised in that the data line (3) has a connection (4) for a

control device (9) outside the vehicle, and the immobiliser (5) communicates with the control
device (2) by way of a portion (3a) of the data line (3), wherein in the absence of a demand

signal (S3) from the control device (9) outside the vehicle at least this control device is
separated from the portion (3a) of the data line (3).
Anti-theft system according to claim 1, characterised in that the control device (9) outside
the vehicle is a diagnostic device.
Anti-theft system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the separation of the
portion (3a) of the data line (3) is achieved by a switch (8) in the data line (3).
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the demand signal
(S3) is emitted by the control device (9) outside the vehicle.
Anti-theft system according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that when the demand signal
(S3) is present the switch (8) is closed when the communication of the immobiliser (5) with

the control device (2) is ended.
Anti-theft system according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the switch (8) is closed
when the immobiliser (5) is not ready f
or operation. 
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the switch (8) is
integrated in the immobiliser (5).
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 4 to 7, characterised in that in the absence of
the demand signal (S3) from the control device (9) outside the vehicle one of the control

devices (2), connected via the data line (3), or the immobilizer (5) operates as the master.
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that, in the connected
state, the control device (9) outside the vehicle takes over the master function from the control

device (2) controlling the data exchange or from the immobiliser (5).
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the control
device (9) outside the vehicle can carry out an unlimited data exchange with the control

devices (2, 6, 7) only when at least one of the control devices is released by the immobiliser
(5).
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the immobiliser
(5), after comparison of the incoming signals (S1) with its stored data, forms a signal derived

from the incoming signals (S2) and emits the said signal to the control devices (2)
communicating with it.
Anti-theft system according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the immobiliser
(5) is integrated in a control device (2) communicating therewith.
