<ABSTRACT>
A frame profile (1) and a bar profile (2) are connected to one another via T-connectors (3 and 4) fastened on the frame profile (1). For mechanical connection, use is made of bolts (9 and 10) which pass through the bar profile (2) and engage into receiving ducts (7 and 8) of the T-connectors (3 and 4). In the respective joint region, the T-connectors (3 and 4) are provided with adhesive-distributing ducts (11, 12) which are accessible from the outside via filling openings (18 and 19) within the bar profile (2). Moreover, the adhesive-distributing ducts (11, 12) exhibit transverse openings (17, 18), with the result that, after the two profiles (1 and 2) have been fitted together, corresponding adhesive can be introduced in a specific manner into the lower joint region via the filling openings (18 and 19).

<CLAIMS>
A T-connection between a transom member and a frame member, 
wherein fixed to the frame member is at least one T-connector which 

projects into a hollow chamber of the transom member and which is 
mechanically connected to the transom member by means of screws, bolts or 

the like and which is additionally glued to the transom member at least in 
the junction or connection region between the frame member and the transom 

member, characterised in that the T-connector (3, 3a, 4, 4a) has at least 
one glue distribution passage (11, 11a, 12, 12a) which extends parallel to 

the frame member (1) and which is accessible by way of at least one filling 
opening (19, 20) in the transom member (2). 
A T-connection according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
glue distribution passage (11, 11a, 12, 12a) extends in the T-connector in 

continuously open condition in the longitudinal direction of the frame 
member and is delimited exclusively by the corresponding hollow chamber 

walls. 
A T-connection according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that the glue distribution passage (11, 12) is in the form of a hollow 

chamber open at its ends in the T-connector (3, 4) and has at least one 
transverse opening (17, 18) extending towards a hollow chamber wall (13, 

14, 15, 16) of the transom member (2), said hollow chamber wall extending 
parallel to the frame member (1). 
A T-connection according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that the glue distribution passage is formed by a groove (11a, 12a) in the 

T-connector (3a, 4a), the groove being open at one side and extending 
parallel to the frame member (1), and the hollow chamber wall (13, 14, 15, 

16) of the transom member (2), which hollow chamber wall is disposed 
opposite the open side of the groove. 
A T-connection according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the transverse openings (17) are in the form of 

transverse bores.  
 
A T-connection according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the transverse openings (18) are in the form of 

transverse slots. 
A T-connection according to claim 5 characterised in that the 
transverse bores (17) extend inclinedly relative to the longitudinal axis 

of the transom member (2).
