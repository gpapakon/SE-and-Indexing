<ABSTRACT>
A remedial ultrasonic wave generating apparatus 
which allows highly efficient dispensation of a medicine 

without complicated preparations is provided. An 
ultrasonic wave generating apparatus for supplying an 

ultrasonic wave signal to a remedial ultrasonic 
oscillation element comprising an ultrasonic wave signal 

generating means for generating an ultrasonic wave 
signal whose frequency randomly changes. The ultrasonic 

wave signal generating means is constituted by, for 
example, a plurality of oscillation circuits oscillating 

at different frequencies and a switching circuit for 
randomly selecting one of the outputs of these 

oscillation circuits based on the output of a random 
number generating circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
generating ultrasonic waves for improving the
dispensation and effect of a medicine or a remedy.To improve the dispensation and effect of a
medicine, application of ultrasonic waves has been
conventionally carried out in the vicinity of the
diseased part to which the medicine is dispensed.For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. H3-36913
which corresponds to U.S. Patents Nos. 4,821,740,
4,953,565 and 5,007,438 discloses an endermic dispensing
tool having a medicine layer and an ultrasonic
oscillation element contained in a common container
wherein the medicine layer is disposed so that it is
exposed directly or through a medicine-permeable member
to the outside at a part of the container and the
ultrasonic oscillation element is disposed so that it is
acoustically coupled to the medicine layer.In the endermic dispensing tool disclosed in the
publication, an ultrasonic wave signal is supplied from
an externally provided ultrasonic oscillator to the
ultrasonic oscillation element which in turn causes
ultrasonic oscillation at a predetermined frequency. The ultrasonic oscillation element is attached to
the forward end of a catheter which is inserted into the
human body. Decomposition of a thrombus is encouraged
by injecting thrombus decomposing medicine through the
catheter with the ultrasonic wave applied to said
thrombus.The effect of a remedy can be improved by the use
of ultrasonic waves during dispensation of a medicine as
described above. The degree of the effect depends on
various conditions, for example, the method of applying
the ultrasonic wave, the frequency and strength of the
ultrasonic wave, the density of the medicine, etc.
Therefore, when an ultrasonic wave and medicine are used
in tandem in a remedy, it is essential to provide
conditions which will enable the greatest efficacy.Although it is known that the efficacy of a remedy
depends on the frequency of the ultrasonic wave which is
used, the optimum frequency has not yet been identified.
The reason is that there are factors with complicated
correlations such as differences between objects to be
treated, e.g., organic structures such as cells and
thrombi, factors associated with the drugs (type,
density, amount, etc.) and factors associated with the
oscillation elements (shape, position, etc.).Therefore, to actually dispense a medicine, for
example, several ultrasonic wave generating apparatuses
having different oscillation frequencies are prepared.
The effect of the dispensation is
