<ABSTRACT>
A can comprising a can body having a top end provided with a seamed cover (4), a screw top (1) with a peripheral gasket (10) and an intermediate member (13) having at least one cut-out and disposed between the gasket and the edge of the can body. The cut-outs of the intermediate member enable venting of the space between the cover and the screw top during gas packing so that the top can be readily unscrewed prior to pulling-off or opening the cover. In addition, the intermediate member (13) includes a pre-scored blank.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container. In 
particular, it relates to a container such as a can for a 
gas-packed product. Such containers are generally intended for packaging 
a product which requires packaging in the presence of an 
inert or neutral gas or mixture of inert or neutral gases, 
together with a hermetic closure, in order to obtain a 
long shelf life. Such containers are particularly 
suitable for products such as powdered milk, for example. Known containers for this sort of product are 
typically of the type used for preserving food, which 
comprise a rigid metal can with a full aperture easy open 
end. The easy open end usually has a score around the 
periphery of a central panel which is broken by means of a 
tab so that the central panel can be removed to provide 
access to the product within. A typical container of this type is described in 
FR-A-2154624 in which a can body is closed by a frangible 
diaphragm seamed to the body. A separate top is used to 
cover the diaphragm and is held in position over the can 
body by a bead on the top which is engaged by protrusions 
on the can body. Since this sort of product is not intended for 
immediate consumption of all the product at once, various 
proposals have been made for closing the container between 
dispensing of the product. One possibility has been to 
provide a flexible plastic lid. Another alternative which 
seeks to ensure a better seal has been to use a screw top 
which has an inner gasket of elastomeric material. This invention seeks to overcome unexpected problems 
which arise when packing a container or can under 
inert/neutral gases. Accordingly, there is provided a can for a product which is 
preservable in the presence of one or more inert or 
neutral gases, comprising a can body, a cover seamed to 
the body, a top having a peripheral gasket,  
 
characterised in that the top is a screw 
top and the can further comprises an 
intermediate member positioned between the gasket and the 
cover, the intermediate member including at least one cut-out for providing a 
vent channel between the outside of the can and the 
confined space under the screw top.  
 For packing of such cans, the can body, cover and 
screw top are provided to the packer together with an end 
for seaming to the body using traditional seaming 
techniques, after the can has been filled. The cover, which is preferably an easy open end, is 
seamed to the can body prior to supplying to the packer. 
This ensures the necessary seal in the conventional manner 
for
