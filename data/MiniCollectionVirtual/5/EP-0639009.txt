<ABSTRACT>
A base station sets up CDMA channels, each defined by a respective spreading sequence (CS, C1,..., Cm) modulating information bits to be transmitted (DS, D1, ..., Dm) in order to form a respective channel signal (SCS, SC1, ..., SCm). The various channel signals are combined then modulated onto a carrier frequency, so as to produce a radio signal of phase modulation transmitted to the mobile stations. Each spreading sequence (CP, CS, C1, ..., Cm) includes only one real component. In order to produce the radio signal, a relative phase shift is applied between different channel signals (SCP, SCS, SC1, ..., SCm).
