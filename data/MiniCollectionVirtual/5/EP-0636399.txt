<ABSTRACT>
A vessel (10) for containing granular material such as sieve material used 
in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant is provided with a baffle (12) 

in the form of, for example, a plurality of concentric rings of 
comparatively small width (w) and large depth (d). The baffle (12) acts to 

reduce and possibly eliminate surface movement of the sieve material thus 
reducing damage thereto and improving sieve performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vessel baffle arrangement and relates particularly,
but not exclusively, to such an arrangement in adsorption vessels such as those
used in oxygen pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants.The adsorption vessels in a PSA plant hold granular sieve material through which air
is passed during the process. The sieve material acts to trap nitrogen present in the
air and thus allows an oxygen rich gas stream to be produced.Whilst PSA plants are designed to avoid velocities within the bed of adsorbent
material which would cause fluidisation, there is often a space or plenum chamber
left between the top of the bed of sieve and the vessel containing it into which sieve
is often dislocated. Transverse and radial gas velocities within the chamber can
often move sieve in a "sand dune" effect which, when repeated during each cycle of
operation will cause attrition of the sieve material to occur, thereby decreasing the
performance of the PSA plant. Significant levels of attrition can occur within hours or
days of the plant being commissioned.Presently known methods of tackling the above mentioned problem include, for
example, covering the surface of the sieve material with a grid, as in GB-A-2091121,
or adding a layer of mesh and covering this with larger particles which are less
susceptible to windage. This, and other methods however have the problem of
reducing the plenum chamber volume which can be important in some processes.
In addition, if the headspace is reduced then it can often be difficult or impossible to
enter the vessel when internal inspection is necessary.EP-A-0468665 discloses a gas treatment apparatus in which a grid retains the upper
surface of the particulate material and in which a number of elongate distensible
hollow members extend into the said upper surface to restrain movement of the
particulate material.US-A-5160513 discloses a downflow reactor comprising a particle bed and baskets
for debris removal which sit on the surface, and extend into, the particle bed. It is an object of the present invention to provide a vessel for containing particulate
material such as sieve with a baffle which reduces and possibly overcomes the
above mentioned problems.Accordingly, the present invention provides a vessel for containing a bed of
particulate material in which a headspace is provided between the
top of the bed and the upper vessel wall, the vessel comprising a baffle for
reducing surface movement of the particulate material and which
is positioned at the surface of

A vessel (10) for containing a bed of particulate material (16) in which
a headspace is provided between the top of the bed and the

upper vessel wall, the vessel (10) comprising a baffle (12) for reducing
surface movement of the particulate material (16) and which

is positioned at the surface of any particulate material (16) within the
vessel (10), characterised in that, the baffle (12) comprises a plurality of

concentric vertical first wall portions (14) which extend above and into said
particulate material (16), thereby to provide a barrier to horizontal surface

movement of said particulate material (16), the arrangement being such
that there is substantially no obstruction to the passage of particulate

material between the surface of the bed of particulate material (16) and
the headspace.
A vessel as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the vertical first wall
portions (14) comprise a plurality of rings, each having a depth (d) and a wall

thickness (w) and in which said depth (d) is greater than said wall thickness
(w).
A vessel as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised in that the vertical first
wall portions (14) comprise right circular rings.
A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised by a
plurality of support members (18) each connected at a first end (18a) to

the vessel and at a second end (18b) to said baffle (12).
A vessel as claimed in any one of the preceding claims characterised in
that the baffle (12) comprises a removable portion (22).
A vessel as claimed in Claim 5
,
 characterised in that said removable
portion (22) comprises one or more second rings which, in operation, is/are removably

suspended from said vertical first wall portions (14) which also have the form of rings. 
A vessel as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that said removable
portion (22) is adapted for concentric suspension within said vertical first wall

portions (14).
