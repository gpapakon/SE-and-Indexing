<ABSTRACT>
A portable mounting device, primarily for electrical equipment, such as mobile telephones for instance. The invention is characterized in that the mounting device (1; 2) includes two suction cups (3, 4) of a known kind that can be applied to and removed from a supportive surface; in that an intermediate member (9) is connected pivotally to each of the suction cups (3, 4); in that the intermediate member (9) includes two parts (10, 11) which are mutually connected by hinge means (12); and in that the intermediate member (9) has at least one flat equipment supporting surface (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable mounting
device, primarily for electrical equipment.In the present context, the term electrical equipment
is meant to include mobile telephones, radio communication
equipment, leisure craft navigational equipment,
and like equipment.Pocket telephones, for instance, are normally carried
constantly on the user's person. The user will normally
have in his/her motor vehicle a fixed telephone
mount to which the telephone can be attached.
A mounting device for a vehicle mobile phone is
e.g. described in SE-B-467 558. However,
on those occasions when the user is not in his/her
vehicle, the user is liable to put down the telephone
in any one of a number of different places.There is often a need to place the telephone firmly in
a holder also on these latter occasions, among other
things to prevent the telephone from being carelessly
moved from place to place and possibly being damaged.
For instance there is at times a need to place the
telephone in a holder when the user is in a motor
vehicle other than his/her own for instance. However,
different telephones have different shapes and consequently
a telephone holder will be specific to a
certain model of telephone. It is not sufficient for a
motor vehicle merely to be equipped with a telephone
holder, since the holder must be adapted to that
particular telephone.A particular need is found in the present aspect in
the case of professional drivers, chauffeurs, and
those who drive different/operate different types of
working machines, where the person concerned changes
between different vehicles and/or machines. There is also a need to be able to mount both a portable
telephone and, for instance, portable navigational
equipment in leisure craft in a simple and efficient
manner.The present invention solves these problems by providing
a mounting device which can be attached to all
types of surface and which can be angled so as to
bring the telephone or other piece of equipment to a
suitable position in relation to a driving place, for
instance.The present invention thus relates to a portable
mounting device, primarily for mobile electronic
equipment, such as mobile telephones for instance, and
is characterized in that the mounting device includes
two suction cups of a known kind that can be applied
to and removed from a supportive surface, in that an
intermediate member is connected pivotally to each of
the suction cups; in that the intermediate member
includes two parts which are mutually connected by
hinge means; and in

A portable mounting device, primarily for electrical
equipment, such as mobile telephones for instance,


characterized
 in that the mounting device
(1; 2) includes two suction cups (3, 4) of a known

kind that can be applied to and removed from a supportive
surface; in that an intermediate member (9) is

connected pivotally to each of the suction cups (3,
4); in that the intermediate member (9) includes two

parts (10, 11) which are mutually connected by hinge
means (12); and in that the intermediate member (9)

has at least one flat surface (13) for supporting said
equipment.
A portable mounting device according to Claim 1,

characterized
 in that the intermediate
member (9) is pivotally connected to respective suction

cups (3, 4) about an axis (14).
A portable mounting device according to Claim 2,

characterized
 in that the hinge means (12)
of the intermediate member (9) has a pivot axis which

extends parallel with the first mentioned pivot axis
(14).
A portable mounting device according to Claim 1, 2
or 3, 
characterized
 in that the hinge
means (12) of the intermediate member (9) divides the

intermediate member (9) into two parts (10, 11) of
essentially mutually equal lengths.
