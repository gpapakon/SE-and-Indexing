<ABSTRACT>
In an electron gun for a CRT in which a plurality of 
cylindrical electrodes are arranged and fixed in series to 

control a path of electron beams emitted from a cathode, a 
cylindrical support member is disposed between at least two 

adjacent cylindrical electrodes so that the two cylindrical 

electrodes are arranged coaxially. One end portion of the 
cylindrical support member and one cylindrical electrode are 

fixed to each other by fitting the former into the latter or 
vice versa, and the other end portion of the cylindrical 

support member and the other cylindrical electrode are fixed to 
each other by fitting the former into the latter or vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron gun for 
use in CRTs (cathode ray tubes) according to the preamble of claim 1. Document FR-A-837 470 discloses an electron gun according to the preamble of claim 1. This document discloses a plurality of cylindrical electrodes arranged in series, a cylindrical support member for supporting at least two adjacent electrodes, wherein one end portion of the support member and are of the two electrode means are fixed to each other by fitting the former into the latter or vice versa. Conventionally, uni-potential electron guns are widely 
used for CRTs. Fig. 14 is a schematic sectional view of a uni-potential 
electron gun. As shown in Fig. 14, the uni-potential 
electron gun consists of a cathode K for emitting an electron 
beam, a first grid G1 and a second grid G2 that constitute, in 
combination with the cathode K, a cathode-grid lens, a third 
grid G3 that constitutes, in combination with the second grid 
G2, a pre-focus lens, and a fourth grid G4 and a fifth grid G5 
that constitute, in combination with the third grid G3, a main 
focus lens. In general, each grid is a cylindrical member made 
of metal. In manufacturing the above type of electron gun, the 
centers of the respective grids need to be positioned on the 
same axis. To arrange and unify the respective grids, in 
general, the respective grids are positioned by the outside-diameter 
reference method and then unified by the glass beading  
 
method. This assembling method is described below in detail. First, as shown in Fig. 15A, a beading jig 100 is 
prepared on which a plurality of grids having different outside 
diameters and shapes, for instance, grids Gn and Gn+1 are to be 
placed. The beading jig 100 has mounting bases An and An+1 which 
have been produced by using the outside diameters of a 
plurality of grids as references so that the grids are rendered 
coaxial when they are mounted thereon. Then, as shown in Fig. 15B, the grids Gn and Gn+1 are 
mounted on the respective mounting bases An and An+1. Then, softened bead glasses BG are pressed against 
fixing parts Bn and Bn+1 of the respective grids Gn and Gn+1 so 
that tip portions of the fixing parts Bn and Bn+1 are buried in 
the bead glasses BG. The grids Gn and Gn+1, are fixed to and 
unified with each other by subsequent cooling (see Fig. 15C). However, where the grids are coaxially fixed to and 
unified with each other by the glass beading method with their 
outside diameters used as references, because of the outside-diameter 
reference
