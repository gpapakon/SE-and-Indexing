<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure herein relates to a new process 
for the preparation of 3-dihaloacetyl (un)substituted 

oxazolidine compounds by the catalytic hydrogenation of 
nitroalcohols with aldehydes or ketones followed by 

reaction with a dihaloacetyl halide as shown below 

wherein
 

   The R and R₁₋₅ groups 
are independently H, C₁₋₆ alkyl, haloalkyl, 

alkylol or alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl 
having up to 8 carbon atoms, phenyl, benzyl or heterocyclyl having up to 

10 carbon atoms and containing O, S and/or N ring atoms and
 

   X and X₁ are independently halogen, preferably chlorine, 
bromine or iodine, especially chlorine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein relates to the field of 
3-dihaloacetyl oxazolidines and to a process for the 
preparation thereof. 3-Dihaloacetyl oxazolidine compounds prepared 
herein are known compounds; they are particularly useful 
as antidotal (safener) compounds to lessen or eliminate 
injury to crop plants by herbicidal compounds. The 3-dihaloacetyl oxazolidine compounds discussed 
herein have been prepared by a variety of processes, 
all of which proceed through the corresponding 
non-haloacetylated precursor oxazolidine compound. The 
latter compounds have been prepared by the reaction of 
mono- and dihydric amino alcohols, e.g., ethanolamine or 
propanolamine, and an aldehyde, such as acetaldehyde, or 
a ketone, such as acetone. Such processes have been 
disclosed, e.g., by M. Senkus, J.A.C.S. 67 1515-1519 
(1945) E.D. Bergmann, Chem. Rev. 53, 309-352, especially 
310-315, (1953) and by I.E. Saavedra, J. Org. Chem,. 
1985, 50, 2379. In adaptations of the above Senkus and 
Bergmann processes, K. D. Petrov et al. (Chem. Abs. 68 
3840 (1967) describe the preparation of 3-(2-hydroxyethyl) 
oxazolidine by the reaction of furfurylaminoethanol 
or tetrahydrofurfurylaminoethanol and dihydroxyethylamine. 
Also described by Petrov et al are modifications 
involving the reaction of N-(2-hydroxyethyl) 
oxazolidine with the appropriate aldehyde, ketone or 
RCO2Et ester containing sodium to prepare oxazolidine 
compounds substituted in the 3-position (i.e., the N 
atom), e.g., with such radicals as C3H7CO2C2H5-, C6H6OCH2-, 
etc. The above process is also described in various 
patents which further show the reaction of the formed  
 
oxazolidine with a dihaloacetyl halide compound, 
typically dichloroacetyl chloride, to produce the 
corresponding 3-dichloroacetyl-(un)substituted oxazolidine 
compounds. Representative of such prior art 
patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,038,284 and 
4,278,799; EP Patent Applications 0 136 016, 0021759 and 
190105 and GB Patent No. 1,544,679. Another process for producing 3-dichloroacetyl 
(un)substituted oxazolidines includes the reaction of 
epichlorohydrin with the appropriate secondary amine (EP 
0253 291). Yet another process for preparing 3-dichloroacetyl 
oxazolidine which are characterized by having 
(un)substituted heterocyclic radicals in the 5-position 
is described in U.S. Patent 5,225,570. The process 
described in this patent involves the reaction of a 
selected heterocyclic aldehyde, e.g., 3-furaldehyde, 
2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde, etc., with cyanotrimethylsilane 
and
