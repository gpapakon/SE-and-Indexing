<ABSTRACT>
An antiskid braking device (26) for a motorcycle (1) 
includes a single pump unit (31) which is used to repressurize 

braking mechanisms of front and rear wheels of the 
motorcycle and mounted almost in a central portion of a 

body frame of the motorcycle and a master cylinder (27) of the 
front wheel. Middle portions of front wheel brake pipes 

connecting the pump unit (31) to the braking mechanisms are 
formed of metallic pipes (46,47), both ends of the metallic pipes (46,47) 

are connected to the braking mechanisms, the master 
cylinder (27) and the pump unit (31) through flexible brake hoses 

(48,49), 
and the metallic pipes (46,47) are arranged along an inside face of 

a pair of bilateral tank rails of the body frame extending 
rearward from a head pipe of the motorcycle. The pump unit (31) 

is mounted so as to extend in a longitudinal dimension 
thereof along a longitudinal direction of the motorcycle 

and a brake pipe port section faces front and rear 
directions of the body of the motorcycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle having an antiskid 
braking device according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. Regarding an antiskid braking device which 
brakes over the shortest possible distance and stops a 
motorcycle without locking the wheels when braking 
suddenly or braking on a slippery road, a control device 
detects an indication that the wheels may lock and reduce 
the master cylinder pressure applied to the braking 
mechanism (brake caliper and the like) preventing the wheel 
from locking. When the indication that the wheel may lock 
diminishes, the control device actuates the pump unit to 
repressurize the control mechanism with an appropriate 
pressure. By repeating the aforementioned operation steps 
quickly, it is possible to brake and stop the motorcycle 
after it travels over the shortest possible distance. Generally, in an antiskid braking device 
provided on a motorcycle, a single pump unit is employed to 
repressurise the braking mechanism on the front and rear 
wheels. Because the pump unit is relatively heavy, it is 
arranged almost in a central portion of the body frame so 
that the pump unit is located near the center of gravity of 
the body. Brake pipes extend to the back and the front of  
 
the body from the pump unit and, then, are connected to the 
control mechanisms and the master cylinders of the front 
and rear wheels. The front wheel brake pipes which connect the 
braking mechanism and the master cylinder of a motorcycle 
to the pump unit extend a relatively long distance. Thus, 
generally, the middle portions of the brake pipes are 
formed of metallic pipes to avoid expansion of the pipes 
due to brake fluid pressure, and both ends of the metallic 
pipes are connected to the front wheel braking mechanism, 
the master cylinder and the pump unit through flexible 
brake hoses. In one aspect, since the metallic pipe sections 
of the front wheel brake pipes extend a long distance from 
the front of the body to the rear as described above, there 
is a fear that the metallic pipes may hit the ground and 
be damaged when a motorcycle falls down. Further, an electric wire harness which extends 
from the front to the rear of the body of the motorcycle is 
placed along the metallic pipes on the body frame of the 
motorcycle. Thus, the mounting space for the metallic pipes 
is reduced, but the electric wire harness is likely to 
interfere with the metallic pipes when assembled to the 
body frame, thereby hindering the assembly process. Furthermore, in
