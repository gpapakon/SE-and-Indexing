<ABSTRACT>
The novel polymeric dyes which are obtainable by reaction of   A) polyamideamines having a weight average molecular weight of 260 to 10,000, which in turn are obtainable by reaction of aliphatic polyamines (I) which contain at least two primary amino groups and at least one secondary amino group optionally in mixture with diamines (II), with dicarboxylic acids ( alpha ), with the proviso that the molar ratio of the sum of the primary and secondary amino groups present in (I) and optionally (II) to the carboxyl groups in ( alpha ) is 
>
 1, preferably 1.05 to 3, with B) a dye which contains in the molecule at least one group which is reactive towards primary and secondary amino groups, the molar ratio of the primary and secondary amino groups present in A) to B) being from 1 to 15, preferably from 1 to 10, are highly suitable for dyeing and printing cellulose- and amido-containing materials and also for use as recording fluids for ink-jet recording systems.
