A device for slitting strip metal (1), consisting of an 
uncoiler (2), on which a coil (3) of a strip metal (1) is 

held, circular shears (4), by means of which the strip 
metal (1) running off from the coil (3) is slit once or 

several times, and also a coiling device (5, 6) for the 
slit strip metal (11, 12), whereby the coiling device 

comprises a coiling reel (5, 6) for each of the even-numbered 
and odd-numbered strip parts (11, 12) situated 

next to one another in the separating direction, both 
coiling reels (5, 6) are driven by motor and are the 

pulling means for the strip metal (1) drawn from the coil 
(3),
characterised in that
 the motor-driven uncoiler (2) and 
the circular shears (4) rotate at the same, preferably 

constant run-off and rotational speed, but with the 
coiling reels (5, 6) being driven at a faster speed, 


in that
 the uncoiler (2) and the coiling reels (5, 6) are 
mounted in a height-adjustable manner on the stand of the 

device (7), whereby it is possible to supply the strip 
(1) running from the uncoiler (2) in a straight line and 

preferably horizontally to the inlet nip of the circular 
shears (4) and the strip (12) (e.g. odd-numbered strip 

sections) slit in the direction of the lower of the two 
cutting rollers (8, 9) of the circular shears (4) 

disposed vertically above one another is supplied to the 
nearer coiling reel (5) at an angle diverging slightly in 

the downward direction from the horizontal, formed by the 
uncoiling strip (1) and the inlet nip of the circular 

shears (4), and the strip (11) (e.g even-numbered strip 
sections) slit in the direction of the upper of the two 

cutting rollers (8, 9) of the circular shears (4) 
disposed vertically above one another is supplied to the 

coiling reel (6) following in the uncoiling direction of  
 

the strip (1) at an angle diverging slightly from the 
horizontal in the upward direction, whereby further 

motorised, pneumatic or hydraulic actuating drives for 
the reels (2, 5, 6) are provided, by means of which this 

strip course can be set at least roughly constant. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the angular divergence of the slit 
strip (11, 12) from the horizontal is roughly 1.5Â°. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the centre distance of uncoiler (2) 
to the circular shears (4) is roughly 900 to 1100 mm, the 

centre distance from circular shears (4) to the first 
coiling reel (5) is roughly 900 to 1100 mm and to the 

second coiling reel (6) is roughly 2400 to 2600 mm.
