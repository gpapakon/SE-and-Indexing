<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetically drivable pump suitable as a pressure supply aggregate for a hydraulic consumer has as driving device a double stroke magnetic system with two exciting windings of identical design arranged next to each other along a common central axis and which coaxially surround an axially movable armature which can be made to move back and forth with the pump piston in step with the alternating current supply of both exciting windings. This pump is designed as a double piston pump (10) with pump pistons (11, 12) and pump chambers (13, 14) of identical design axially arranged on both sides of the armature. The pump pistons (11, 12) have central throughchannels (97, 98) which are permanently in communication with the pump chambers (13, 14) and which are connected to inlet chambers provided in the armature (18) over inlet check valves centrally arranged in the armature (18). The armature input chamber is kept in communication with the hydraulic medium reservoir (104). The central channel (53) within which the armature (18) is movable back and forth is also in communication with the reservoir (104). The frequency and/or the current intensity of the exciting pulses used to alternatively power the exciting windings (22, 23) are adjustable.
