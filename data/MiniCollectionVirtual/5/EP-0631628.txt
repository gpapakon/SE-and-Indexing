<DESCRIPTION>
 TRANSGENICWHEATHELD OFTHEINVENTIONThe present invention provides a method for producing transgenic wheat plants which comprises introducing foreign DNA via the pollen tubes, thereby obtaining a transgenic embryo which can develop into a mature transgenic plant.The present invention also provides transgenic wheat plants.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTSince the advent of recombinant DNA technology and its successful application in the transformation of various organisms, one of the main goals has been to apply this technology for the transformation of plants in general and agriculturally important crops, e.g. wheat, in particular. Such transformation aims at the production of transgenic plants having new traits which provide certain growth advantages such as improved root systems, herbicide resistance and pest resistance.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 With a steadily increasing world population it has long been realised that there exists an urgent need for increasing the yield of important crops such as grain crops, in particular wheat, and this by developing new varieties of such plants that have the aforesaid growth advantages. Various methods for transforming plants have been developed.One such method involves the preparation of protoplasts from plant tissue, the transformation thereof in vitro and subsequently the regeneration of the transformed protoplasts into transgenic whole plants.Other methods employ the Agrobacterium tumefasciens system by which recombinant T-DNA from Ti or Ri plasmids become inserted into the nuclear DNA of plant cells. Yet another method for transforming plant tissues with foreign DNA involves the bombardment of plant cells with DNA-coated carrier particle projectiles, whereby some of these projectiles penetrate the plant cells and insert the foreign DNA therein. Various other methods of micro-injection of foreign DNA into plant organs, in particular reproductive or regenerative organs have also been employed for the purposes of producing transgenic plants.All of the aforesaid methods were developed primarily for the transformation of Dicotyledonous plants and were successfully applied in such plants. However, they were found to be less applicable for transforming Monocotyledonous plants, in particular wheat plants.One of the reasons that the aforesaid methods were not applicable to many Monocotyledonous plants is the fact that it is very difficult to regenerate their cells grown in tissue culture into whole plants.

CLAIMS:
1. A method for producing transgenic wheat plants comprising:
(a) emasculating wheat plant florets by removing all pollinator anthers prior to their maturation and then inducing synchronized pollination by pollinating the stigmas of said florets with mature male pollinator anthers from the same or a different variety of wheat plant;
(b) applying a droplet of an aqueous DNA solution onto one or more pollinated stigmas, following a time period after pollination in which the pollen tubes in the pollinated stigmas have started to grow into the style but have not yet reached the ovary, said DNA solution comprising a suitable DNA vector carrying at least one gene foreign to the plant and capable of inducing the expression of a desirable trait in the plant and optionally an additional marker gene; (c) maintaining said DNA solution droplet on said stigma in a humid environment for a period of time to ensure that said DNA vector reaches and enters the ovule;
(d) protecting the treated plants of step (c) from additional pollination by any nearby plants, growing said plants and collecting the seeds developed in said florets; and
(e) growing said seeds under conditions adapted for the selection of transformed wheat plants.
