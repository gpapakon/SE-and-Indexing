<ABSTRACT>
An upholstered furniture system for mounting on a horizontal surface is disclosed. The system comprises vertical arm members (22, 24), side support members are affixed to the inner surfaces (21) of the arm members for removably supporting a seat member. Support elements (62) are affixed to the back portions of the inner surfaces of the arm member and a back member (26) is interposed between the arm members. The back member (26) includes an outer back part having outer back part side members (84) supported on the support elements and a horizontal top rail (94) extending between the side members. An inner back part (87) is provided having inner back part side members (90) and a horizontal inner back part top rail (92) between the side members. A hinge (106) connects both top rails to permit rotation of the inner back part about a horizontal axis parallel to the back top rails. The rotation of the inner back part about the horizontal axis brings the inner back part into contact with support elements limiting the rotation of the inner back part.

 MULTI -FUNCTIONAL UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE SYSTEMCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 07/720,369 filed June 25th, 1991.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to furniture, and in particular to furniture having interchangeable components. In conventional upholstered furniture, such as chairs, love seats, sofas and sleepers, the standard method of construction utilizes a fully assembled wood or wood-product frame having a seat, a front rail and a back rail. The frame is covered by a non-removable fabric covering, and upholstery consisting of materials such as fiber and foam are attached to the fabric covering. Springs, webbing or other means of support are per¬ manently attached below the seat to the front and back rails. The pitch of the seat is determined by the difference in height between the front and back rails.It is also conventional to provide furniture having a sleeper mechanism and folding mattress permanently attached to a wood frame. However, conventional furniture designed to receive a sleeper mechanism requires a completely different size and design of frame than a non-sleeper sofa having the same appearance. The spring units used in conventional sofas and the sleeper mechanisms used in sleeper-type sofas are not inter¬ changeable either before or after the upholstering process.Back cushions used with both types of furniture, sleeper and non-sleeper, may be either "tight" (upholst¬ ered as part of the overall frame) or "loose" (individual cushions separate from the frame) . In both types of furniture, once the frame has been completed only minimal modifications can be made in the shape and style of the 

 upholstered piece. It cannot be altered once the fabric covering has been attached.The design of conventional upholstered furniture imposes many limitations on the manufacturer, the retailer and the consumer. The manufacturer is faced with an industry that demands constant style changes, although such changes are difficult to make because there are few interchangeable parts among the many different' styles and few styles are popular for more than two or three years. As a result, he is forced to periodically design and fabricate new components for each style. Frequent redesign of the product and retooling of produc¬ tion equipment imposes a heavy burden on the manufacturer in terms of both inventory control and maintaining manufacturing efficiency.Another limitation on the manufacturer is that •

WHAT IS CLAIMED:
1. An easily assembled and disassembled upholstered furniture system for mounting on a substantially horizontal surface, comprising first and second spaced apart substantially vertical arm members, each of said first and second arm members having an inner surface including back and front por¬ tions; first and second side support members affixed to the inner surfaces of said first and second arm members respectively for removably and interchangeably supporting either a seat member or a sleeper unit; first and second support elements affixed to the back portions of the inner surfaces of said first and second arm members respectively; a back member interposed between said first and second spaced apart arm members, said back member including an outer back part having first and second spaced apart vertical outer back part side members supported on said first and second support elements respectively; and a horizontal outer back part top rail extending between said first and second vertical outer back part side members; and an inner back part having first and second spaced apart vertical inner back part side members; and a horizontal inner back part top rail extending between said first and second vertical inner back part side members; and hinge means connecting said outer back part top rail to said inner back part top rail, said hinge means permitting rotation of said inner back part about a horizontal axis parallel to said outer and inner back part top rails;
