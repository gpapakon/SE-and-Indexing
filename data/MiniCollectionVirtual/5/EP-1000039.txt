<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain quinazoline compounds as well as the
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention
inhibit the action of certain growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTK)
thereby inhibiting the abnormal growth of certain cell types. The compounds of this
invention are therefore useful for the treatment of certain diseases that are the result of
deregulation of these PTKs. The compounds of this invention are anti-cancer agents
and are useful for the treatment of cancer in mammals. In addition, the compounds of
this invention are useful for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease in mammals.
This invention also relates to the manufacture of said quinazolines, their use for the
treatment of cancer and polycystic kidney disease, and the pharmaceutical preparations
containing them.Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a
phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue located on a protein substrate. Protein
tyrosine kinases clearly play a role in normal cell growth. Many of the growth factor
receptor proteins function as tyrosine kinases and it is by this process that they effect
signaling. The interaction of growth factors with these receptors is a necessary event in
normal regulation of cell growth. However, under certain conditions, as a result of
either mutation or overexpression, these receptors can become deregulated; the result of
which is uncontrolled cell proliferation which can lead to tumor growth and ultimately
to the disease known as cancer [Wilks A.F., Adv. Cancer Res., 60, 43 (1993) and
Parsons, J.T.; Parsons, S.J., Important Advances in Oncology, DeVita V.T. Ed., J.B.
Lippincott Co., Phila., 3 (1993) ]. Among the growth factor receptor kinases and their
proto-oncogenes that have been identified and which are targets of the compounds of
this invention are the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (EGF-R kinase, the
protein product of the erbB oncogene), and the product produced by the erbB-2 (also
referred to as the neu or HER2) oncogene. Since the phosphorylation event is a
necessary signal for cell division to occur and since overexpressed or mutated kinases
have been associated with cancer, an inhibitor of this event, a protein tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, will have therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer and other diseases
characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cell growth. For example, overexpression
of the receptor kinase product of the erbB-2 oncogene has been associated
