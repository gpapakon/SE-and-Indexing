<ABSTRACT>
A power supply unit having a monitoring circuit for the detection of lengthy power supply failures comprises a power supply transformer (2), a rectifier (1) for generating an unregulated DC voltage, a first integrated circuit (6) for generating and regulating a DC output voltage, and a second integrated circuit (8) for generating a power supply interruption signal when a lengthy power supply failure has been detected due to the monitoring of the unregulated DC voltage by comparison with a reference voltage. In this case, the reference voltage is derived from the DC output voltage. The second integrated circuit (8) is a comparator with hysteresis. The advantages reside in the fact that improved electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and a more cost-effective construction, because standard components are used, are achieved.
