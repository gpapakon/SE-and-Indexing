<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a device for screwing on screw closures, especially screw closures having an original securing ring which grips round a transfer ring on the bottle neck, in order to achieve a reliable closing process and a defined closing torque, provision is made for the sensor for recording the torque to take the form of a torque sensor (Md) which continuously detects the applied torque in each case, for a regulator to be arranged downstream of the torque sensor (Md) in such a way that the output signal of the torque sensor (Md) is fed to the regulator as an actual torque value, an output of the regulator being connected to the braking magnet coupling (10) in order to adjust the preset desired values by comparing a stored desired value or desired value curve with the actual values supplied by the torque sensor (Md) and by acting on the amount of current and/or duration of current and/or duration of current pulse of the braking magnet coupling (10).

An apparatus for the screwing on of screw closures, in particular of 
screw closures having a tamperproof safety ring overlapping a transfer 

ring on the bottle neck, comprising a screwing-on head (1) drivable to 
rotate and seizing or, respectively, overlapping the screw cap and which 

is disposed on the free front end of a drive shaft (2), the drive shaft 
(2), by way of an electromagnetic coupling (20), being connectable to the 

shaft, driven to rotate, of a rotary drive for the formation of a drive 
coupling, the screwing-on head (1) being reciprocatingly supported for 

engagement with the screw cap, a magnetic brake coupling (10) being 
disposed between the drive shaft bearing the screwing-on head and a 

coupling housing disposed against rotation and surrounding the electromagnetic 
coupling (20), and a sensor being provided for the detection of 

the screwing torque, 
characterized in that
 a device is provided for detecting 
the distance of lowering of the screwing-on neck in that the 

sensor for detecting the torsional moment is a torque indicator (Md) 
continuously detecting the torsional moment occurring in each case, in 

that a controller is disposed downstream of the torque indicator (Md) in 
such a way that the output signal of the torque indicator (Md) is fed as 

an actual value of the torsional moment to the controller, an output of 
the controller being connected with the magnetic brake coupling (10), for 

controlling on the preset desired values by comparison of a stored desired 
value or desired value course depending on the screwing-on distance 

with the actual values furnished by the torque indicator (Md), and 
by devices for acting on the intensity or on the duration or pulse duration 

of current exerted on the brake coupling (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a device for the 
continuous detection of the lowering distance is provided, the output of 

which is connected with the controller. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the device for 
the detection of the lowering distance is an incremental transmitter.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 on the outside 
of the housing (5) of the apparatus, a rack (25) is disposed, with which 

a pinion (26) of the stationary incremental transmitter engages. 
Method for screwing on screw closures by means of an apparatus according 
to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a desired course of the torsional 
moment in dependence on the screwing-on distance is stored in the 

controller, in that the lowering distance is detected for each individual 
screwing-on operation by means of a corresponding indicator and in that 

the desired torque stored for the respective lowering distance is compared 
with the actual torque detected by the torque indicator and in that the 

brake coupling is engaged more or less depending on the deviation. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the control of the 
torsional moment commences at such a lowering distance as corresponds to 

the overlapping of the lower edge of the transfer ring by the lower edge 
of the tamperproof safety ring of the closure cap. 
Method according to claim 6, 
characterized in that,
 once the control 
has been started, the screwing-on torque is first kept constant and then 

increased to a final value corresponding to the envisaged closing torque. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterized in that,
 after this preset 
closing torque value has been reached, the control is stopped, and by 

utilization of the maximum braking effect, the torsional moment acting on 
the screw cap is set toward zero. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 an output of the 
controller is connected with a memory or recorder for recording the torque 

values realized in each individual screwing-on operation. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterized in that,
 the provided 
closing torque not being reached because of the individual facts during a 

certain screwing operation, an error report is emitted and, possibly, a  
 

discharger is activated for sorting out the bottle that is not regularly 
closed.
