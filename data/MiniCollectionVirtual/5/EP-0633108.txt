A method of processing polyester waste in a continuously
or discontinuously operating apparatus comprising a reactor

or upstream container for preparing the component to be
recycled and a melting reactor device, in which method, in a

first step, the component to be recycled is sintered at
temperatures of from 140°C to 210°C in a gas stream and then,

in a second step, said component having a sintered structure
is mixed with a primary polyester component containing

hydroxyl end groups after heating to a maximum of 230°C and
held in a reactive state for a predetermined period.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
component to be recycled has an amorphous material content

greater than 80%.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in
that the component to be recycled is mixed with the primary

polyester component in an amount of up to 60%.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the primary polyester component has

COOH end group content of less than 35% milli-equivalents/g
and an OH end group content greater than 58 milli-equivalents/g.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the mixture is held in a reactive state

for a maximum of 45 minutes.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the sintered material of the component 

to be recycled is condensed in the air stream for a period of
120 minutes at from 190°C to 230°C.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, after the component to be recycled has

been treated for approximately 2 hours in the air stream and
prior to its being mixed with the primary polyester

component, nitrogen is added at a temperature of from 200°C
to 255°C.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, prior to mixing, the primary polyester

component exhibits a polycondensation level ranging from 50
to 135 units.
A device for carrying out the method according to any one
of claims 1 to 8, in which, for treatment of the component to

be recycled, there is provided a container (3) with an inlet
end and an outlet end for producing a column of material to

be recycled, wherein the container is provided with stirring
and dispersing apparatuses and comprises at least one feeder

(4, 5) for introducing a gas heated to a temperature in the
range of from 150°C to 250°C, and wherein the inlet end of

the container (3) comprises supply and metering apparatuses
(1, 2) for supplying the component to be recycled and the

outlet end of the container (3) is connected in a
controllable manner with an inlet of a melting reactor (10),

which comprises a second inlet (11) for metered supply of the
primary component.
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that the
container (3) is elongate and disposed with its inlet end at

the top and in that the melting reactor (10) is arranged
below the container.
A device according to claim 9 or claim 10, characterised
in that the at least one feed line (4, 5) ends in a closed 

circular pipeline (20) surrounding the container (3)
annularly and perpendicularly to the longitud
inal axis
thereof, said closed circular pipeline (20) being connected

with the inside of the container by a plurality of openings
distributed around the circumference of the latter.
A device according to any one of claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that an extruder is arranged between the

outlet end of the container and the first inlet of the
melting reactor (10).
A device according to any one of claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that a buffer container (12) is arranged

between the outlet end of the container and the first inlet
of the melting reactor (10).
