<ABSTRACT>
A method of resin insert molding a metal member, 
and a connector block (1) for injectors of an internal 

combustion engine having a bar-like body in which bar-like 
bus bars (2) are arranged in a parallel attitude and embedded 

in a resin. In the molding method, a core member (7) includes 
bus bar slots (9) in which the bus bars are placed in a 

desired attitude; positioning projections (11) that butt 
against the inner wall of a mold cavity (16) of a mold for 

resin molding; and holding-pin holes (12) into which holding 
pins (17) of the mold cavity are fitted so as to form a 

separation layer between the bus bars (2) and the holding 

pins. The assembled core member is inserted into the mold 
cavity (16) of the mold for resin molding, to be held thereby, 

and the core member (7) is embedded in a resin to form a 
desired shape. The injector connector block (1) is formed 

into a bar-like shape using the molding method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of resin insert molding 
a metal member, such as an electrical component for an 
automobile. The invention also relates to a connector block 
for injectors of an internal combustion engine, in which a 
metal member such as an electric conductor is embedded in a 
resin. The connector block can be produced by the resin insert 
molding method. Molded products made of multiple materials, which may 
include, for example, metal members inserted into a resin, 
are injection molded using a process in which the metal 
members are held in a desired attitude in a mold cavity of 
a mold for resin molding. Each metal member inserted into 
the mold cavity is fixed by holding pins protruding into 
the mold cavity, which leaves holding holes that communicate 
with the metal member after the mold is removed. Even 
if the holes are filled after the resin molding process, 
the post-filled portions are not sufficiently waterproof 
and airtight. As a result, this technique may cause corrosion 
of the metal member. In addition, when the metal member 
is used as an electric conductor, electric failure may 
occur. A molding method for eliminating these disadvantages 
has been proposed in e.g. EP-A-0 500 219. In this proposed 
method, a bus bar bundle, which has bus bars arranged in a 
desired manner, is partially embedded and held, and a preformed 
portion having leftover holding pin holes is primarily 
formed by resin molding. The bus bar bundle with the 
preformed portion is then inserted into a mold cavity of a 
mold for resin molding, and the inserted attitude is fixed 
by fitting holding pins of the mold into the holding pin 
holes of the preformed portion. Secondary processing is 
conducted so that the bus bar bundle with the preformed 
portion is embedded in a resin to form a desired form.  
 Japanese Utility Model Publication (Kokai) No. HEI 
3-77062, and Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. HEI 
4-263913 disclose connector blocks for injectors of an internal 
combustion engine in which connecting ends are 
formed by vertically bending bus bars to form tip ends that 
rise from the bus bar main portions and function as tab 
terminals. Each of the bus bars, except the tab terminals, 
is embedded in a resin so that the tab terminals are formed 
as an injector connecting portion protruding from the main 
portion. Although the molding methods described above have the 
advantages that the bus bars embedded in the resin are prevented 
from being corroded and electrically 
short-circuited,
