<ABSTRACT>
A profile-moulding connection for connecting two profile mouldings (1), arranged one beside the other or one behind the other in the longitudinal direction of the profiles, exhibits at least one cavity (10), which is enclosed on all sides by walls, and, on at least one of the walls, a receiving means (12) for plugging-in a sheet-like structural element (14) which engages into the receiving means by its borders. At least one single-part profile connector (29), which engages into the profile mouldings (1) which are to be connected, is connected in a frictionally locking manner to the profile mouldings by virtue of deformation of the same. The profile connector can be fixedly clamped in the profile mouldings. It engages into two mutually opposite receiving means (12) of two profile mouldings (1) which are arranged one beside the other in parallel. The profile connector (29) is designed as a solid, preferably cuboidal block. It is made from metal, preferably from aluminium. A plurality of profile connectors (29) are arranged over the entire length of the profile mouldings (1). The receiving means are designed as a U-profile, whose mutually opposite longitudinal side walls (16, 17) are formed by a free leg (18), integrally formed on the yoke (20) of the U-profile, and a wall which is adjacent to said leg.
