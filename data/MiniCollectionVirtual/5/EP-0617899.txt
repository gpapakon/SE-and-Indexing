<ABSTRACT>
A fresh, creamy, fruit-containing spread which is 
additive-free and contains many live thermophilic lactic 

ferments. The original aromatic characteristics, as well 
as the new texture, make said product particulary 

attractive and suitable also for the early childhood 
feeding. It has an average content of fat matter on the 

dry substance of 26%. A process for preparing said 
fruit-containing spread is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a fresh, creamy, fruit-containing spread, 
which is free from additives and contains a remarkable 
amount of live lactic ferments in optimal ratio, and to 
a spread which is obtainable by said process. The fruit 
preparations employed in the process and spread object 
of the present invention are absolutely natural, that is 
free from aromatizers, preservants, antioxidants, 
thickeners and acidity controllers. Many alimentary spreads which are more or less fat 
are presently on the market. Particular preparation 
technologies are common to all these specialities, and 
they make the products thus obtained generally poor in 
or completely devoid of lactic charge. Said products 
contain moreover fruit compositions always added with 
preservants, flavouring agents, antioxidants, thickeners 
and acidity controllers. Bacteriological analyses carried out on other 
products of the same type as far as their preparation is 
concerned and actually on the market, have shown the 
following values in lactic charge: 
Danito: absent/1 g S. thermophilus< 10 g L. bulgaricus< 10 g Mesophilic< 10 g Fruttolo: absent/1 g S. thermophilus< 10 g L. bulgaricus< 10 g Mesophilic< 10 g. From the literature two main processes are known for 
obtaining fat or semi-fat dairy products: one employing 
the centrifugal separation technology and the other 
based on ultrafiltration. Where the centrifugal separation is concerned, after  
 
the usual milk treatments (cleaning, degassing, 
pasteurization, and so on) and the inoculation with 
lactic ferments (maturation), the acidified milk is 
heated and submitted to centrifugal separation at 
temperatures ranging between 60 and 80째C. Thus a 
concentrate is obtained which is then mixed with cream 
and alternatively, in the case of products contemplating 
the addition of fruit, with aromatized fruit 
preparations to which preservants, dyes, flavouring 
agents, antioxidants and acidity controllers have been 
added. As mentioned above, the end product has a lactic 
flora almost always completely inactivated as a result 
of the heat treatments, a reduced creamy taste and a 
particular flaky structure. The ultrafiltration technology exhibits some 
advantages as compared to the centrifugal separation. So 
the concentration process taking place directly on the 
acidified milk allows reduced processing temperatures to 
be adopted (maximum 40째C), so that the lactic ferments 
survival can be ensured. Furthermore it enables the 
nutritional milk

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a fresh, creamy, fruit-containing 
spread containing live thermophilic lactic 

ferments in a ratio of cocci to rods of 5-15:1, being 
free from flavouring agents, preservants, antioxidants, 

thickeners, acidity controllers and other additives and 
having an average content of fat matter of 26% on the 

dry substance, said process consisting of the following 
steps: 


a) preliminary milk treatment, comprising cleaning, 
optional titration, pre-heating, pasteurization, cooling 

and introduction into maturation tanks pressurized with 
sterile air; 
b) maturation, comprising the inoculation of different 
thermopilic lactic ferments species in a ratio of cocci 

to rods of 5-15:1 and in a amount of 1%, rennet addition 
and curd breaking, the maturation being carried out for 

a time of 6 hours and until a pH of 4.9-5.0 is reached; 
c) concentration, consisting in subjecting the acidified 
product at 38-40째C obtained in step (b) to uninterrupted 

ultrafiltration (UF) at a constant temperature of 40째C, 
thus obtaining a permeate and a semi-finishe
d product; 
d) mixing and homogenization, in which the semi-finished 
product obtained in step (c) 

is mixed with pasteurized cream and 
sugar and a fruit preparation is added to the semi-finished 

product mixed with pasteurized cream and sugar the end 
product not being subjected to any further heat treatment for microbic 

stabilization after coagulation; 
e) packaging, in which the product after the 
homogenization step is sent to a sterile device able for 

its metering and for sealing the package. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the ratio of cocci to 
rods is of 10:1. 
The process of claim 1, wherein as thermophilic 
ferments S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are employed, 

and during inoculation step also L. acidophilus and 
Bifido-bacterium infantis in an amount of 0,5-1%, based  

 
on total weight of matured milk, are added. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the homogenization is 
carried out at a pressure of 100-200 bar. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the fruit preparation 
added in step d) is refined until 0.2 mm and consists of 

a fully natural fruit preparation, that is free from 
flavouring agents, antioxidants, thickeners, preservants 

and acidity controllers, said preparation being added in 
an amount of 27-30%, based on the concentrated semi-finished 

product mixed with pasteurized cream and sugar. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the fruit preparation 
is selected from: 


mashed apples, sugar 
mashed bananas, sugar 
mashed strawberries, strawberry juice, raspberry 
juice, mashed raspberries, blueberry juice, mashed 

blueberries (the so called woodberry mixture), sugar 
mashed apricots, sugar 
mashed pineapples, sugar 
mashed citrus, sugar 
mashed pears. sugar 
mashed strawberries, sugar 
mashed raspbnerries, sugar 
mashed blueberries, sugar. 
A fresh, creamy, fruit-containing spread containing 
live thermophilic lactic ferments in the ratio of cocci 

to rods of 5-15:1, being free from flavouring agents, 
preservants, antioxidants, thickeners, acidity 

controllers and other additives, having an average 
content of fat matter on the dry substance of 26%, and 

being obtainable by the process of one or more of claims 
1 to 6. 
The spread of claim 7, having a structure with a  
 

particle size of 0,2 mm.
