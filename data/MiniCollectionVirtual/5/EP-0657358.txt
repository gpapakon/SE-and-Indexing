<ABSTRACT>
A container (1,101,201,301,401) is provided for dispensing measured 
amounts of flowable solid material. The container includes a 

storage chamber (2,102,202,302,402), 
a measuring chamber (3,103,203,303,403) having a predetermined 

volume and communicating with the storage chamber (2,102,202,302,402) 
to be filled therefrom, and a dispensing chamber (4,104.204,304,404) 

for receiving the 
measured volume of material from the measuring chamber 

(3,103,203,303,403) while 
surplus material is returned to the storage 

chamber (2,102,202,302,402). A 
second measuring chamber (335) may be provided to reduce the amount 

of the measured volume prior to dispensing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with containers 
for dispensing flowable solid material. The term 
"flowable solid material" is utilized throughout the 
specification to denote solid material in discrete 
form. Thus, the term encompasses granular, 
particulate, flake, crystalline, coarse powder and 
other similarly constituted flowable materials. The 
physical characteristics of each individual material 
are such that each material will adopt an angle of 
repose which differs, or may differ, from the angle of 
repose of other material falling within the general 
category of flowable solid materials. The angle of 
repose is the angle adopted by the sides of a pile of 
flowable solid material beyond which the pile becomes 
unstable and material will tumble or sift down the 
sides rearranging the pile until stability is achieved. Measuring containers having a storage chamber 
and a measuring chamber or head with a partial barrier 
therebetween permitting pouring of a predetermined 
amount of liquid from the storage chamber to the 
measuring chamber for dispensing a measured amount are 
known. Examples of such measuring containers are 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,646,948: 4,079,859 and 
4,298,038. Those measuring containers were designed 
for the pouring of measured amounts of liquid and would 
be less suitable for dispensing measured amounts of  
 
flowable solid material. It is against this background 
that the applicant has devised a measuring container 
having a specific configuration and function which is 
capable of first measuring and then dispensing a 
predetermined amount of flowable solid material. It is thus an object of the invention to 
provide a container which enables a measured amount of 
flowable solid material to be transferred from a 
storage area to a location from which the measured 
amount can be dispensed. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide a container in which the flowable solid 
material transferred to the dispensing location can be 
dispensed without further material flowing from the 
storage area. It is a still further object of the present 
invention to provide an alternative container 
configuration whereby after a predetermined measured 
volume of material has been transferred from the 
storage container to the dispensing location, a 
predetermined portion of that measured volume can be 
returned to the storage container prior to dispensing 
the remainder of initially measured amount from the 
dispensing location. According to the present invention there is 
provide

dispensing a predetermined amount of flowable solid material, 

said container including a storage chamber 
(2:102:202:302:402), and a dispensing chamber 

(4:104:204:304:404), characterized in that a measuring 
chamber (3:103:203:303:403) communicates with said storage 

chamber in such manner as to be fillable with material from 
said storage chamber upon tilting of said container from an 

initial position to a tilted position to pour material from 
said storage chamber (2:102:202:302:402) into said measuring 

chamber (3:103:203:303:403), said measuring chamber having a 
closed bottom and being separated from said dispensing 

chamber by a barrier wall portion (12:112:212:312:412) which 
extends from said closed bottom upwardly to a passage 

(13:113:213:313) communicating with said dispensing chamber 
and which enables said measuring chamber to be completely 

filled substantially to the level of said passage when the 
container is in said tilted position, said measuring chamber 

communicating with said dispensing chamber by way of said 
passage in such manner that upon reversion of the container 

to said initial position material will transfer from the 
measuring chamber to the dispensing chamber and surplus 

material which had not entered the measuring chamber will 
return to the storage chamber (2:102:202:302:402).

wall portion provides a weir (11:111:211:311) over which 
material may be poured from the storage chamber to fill the 

measuring chamber. 
A container according to claim 2, characterized in 
that a filling passage (226:326) extends downwardly into the 

storage chamber at a location proximate the weir (211:311), 
 

said weir and external surface of the filling passage 
defining a passage (231:341) providing communication between 

the storage chamber and the measuring chamber. 
A container as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the filling passage is closable by a plug (327). 
A container as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the measuring chamber and dispensing chamber are 

positioned side by side and are separated one from the other 
by the barrier wall portion, said barrier wall portion 

extending toward but terminating short of a front wall 
portion of the storage chamber to define, with said front 

wall portion, the communicating passage between the measuring 
and dispensing chambers. 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the container comprising the storage, 

measuring and dispensing chambers and barrier is a unitary 
molding of plastics material. 
A container as claimed in claim 3, characterized in

external periphery of the filling passage (326), said second 
measuring chamber (335) being fillable from the dispensing 

chamber (304) upon tilting of said container beyond the 
initial position, and in that the second measuring chamber 

(335) is disposed to cooperate with the weir (311) in such 
manner that, upon reverting the container to the initial 

position, the material within the second measuring chamber 
(335) will be returned to the storage chamber (302) and the 

remaining material will be returned to the dispensing 
chamber (304). 
For measuring and dispensing a predetermined amount 

of flowable solid material, a container (301:401) including a 
storage chamber (302:402) and a dispensing chamber (304:404), 

characterized in that the container further includes, a first 
measuring chamber (303:403) and a second measuring chamber 

(335:435), said first measuring chamber (303:403) 
communicating with the storage chamber (302:402) in such 

manner as to be fillable with material from said storage 
 

chamber upon tilting said container in a first direction from 
an initial position to pour material from said storage 

chamber (302, 402) into said first measuring chamber 
(303:403), said first measuring chamber having a closed 

bottom and being separated from said dispensing chamber by a 
barrier wall portion which extends from said closed bottom 

upwardly to a passage communicating with said dispensing 
chamber and which enables said first measuring chamber 

(303:403) to be completely filled substantially to the level 
of said passage when the container is tilted in said first 

direction, said first measuring chamber (303:403) 
communicating with said dispensing chamber in such manner 

that upon reversion of the container to said initial position 
material will transfer from the first measuring chamber 

(303:403) to the dispensing chamber (304:404) and surplus 
material which had not entered the first measuring chamber 

will return to the storage chamber (302:402), and said second 
measuring chamber (335:435) communicating with the dispensing 

chamber (304:404) and being fillable therefrom upon tilting 
of said container in a second direction opposite to said 

first direction beyond the initial position to pour material 
from the dispensing chamber (304:404) to fill the second 

measuring chamber (335:435), the relative dispositions of 
said chambers being such that when the container is again 

returned to the initial position, the material filling the 
second measuring chamber (335,435) will return directly to 

the storage chamber (302:402) and the material initially in 
the dispensing chamber (304:404) which had not entered the 

second measuring chamber returns to said dispensing chamber.

between the storage chamber and the aligned openings in the 

filling bore and the plug wall portion and in that the second 
measuring chamber (435) is located within the hollow plug and 

is separated from the passage extending from the plug bottom 
to the opening in the wall portion.
