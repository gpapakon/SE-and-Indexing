<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a system for performing
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and more particularly to an
apparatus and method for performing PCR on a DNA or RNA sample
without removing it from its original cell structure.The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a process for making
a very large number of faithful copies of a segment of double-stranded
DNA (amplifying) by thermally cycling one or more
molecules of this DNA (the template DNA) in the presence of
thermally stable DNA polymerase enzyme, (typically Taq
polymerase), the four DNA nucleotide bases and two or more
single-stranded DNA primers. These primers are short segments
of the order of 20 bases that are complementary to the 5' ends
of the two complementary DNA single strands which make up the
double-stranded template.PCR is an immensely valuable technique which is very widely
practiced, and has revolutionized the field of molecular
biology. The technique is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, and 4,965,188. The reaction has
until recently been carried out in solution in small reaction
vessels, where the DNA to be amplified is in suspension.
Apparatus for this process is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,038,852 and in EP-A-0 567 284.Recently it has been found possible to apply PCR to amplify
specific DNA segments inside cells, without first extracting the
DNA from the cells. This technique is called in situ PCR. The
cells may be individual cells, or part of a tissue sample. Most
often, in situ PCR is performed on cells or thin slices of
tissue mounted on microscope slides. The cells or tissue
usually have been fixed by treatment with formalin, or other
reagents so that their morphology is preserved and recognizable
after treatment.If the selected DNA segment is amplified in such a way that
the amplified product DNA can be selectively stained, then
microscopic examination of the PCR treated cells can identify
which cells in a tissue sample, if any, contain the specific DNA
segment, and even where within the cell it is located.
Visualization of the amplified DNA within the cells can be
achieved by either of two methods. One method uses a
complementary single stranded DNA probe to which a label
molecule has been attached. This probe is hybridized to the
specific DNA sequences in the amplified sample, if there are
any, and the excess probe and label is washed away. Then the
locations of the remaining label molecules are rendered visible
by treatment with developer reagents. This technique for
visualization
