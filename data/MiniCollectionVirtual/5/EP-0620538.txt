<ABSTRACT>
A coin wrapping machine includes a coin stacking 
device for stacking coins; a coin support post (70) for receiving 

the stacked coins at a post waiting position immediately 
below the coin stacking device and supporting them on the 

upper surface thereof; a coin wrapping device including a 
plurality of wrapping rollers (86a,86b,86c) for winding a wrapping film 

(106) around the stacked coins and producing a wrapped coin roll; 
a support post moving mechanism for moving the coin support 

post (70) between the post waiting position, a post wrapping 
position where the supported coins can be wrapped by the 

coin wrapping device and a post retracted position where the 
coin support post (70) is retracted from between the wrapping 

rollers (86a,86b,86c); and a mode selector (151) for selecting a counting 
mode 

which causes the coin wrapping machine to only count coins 
or a wrapping mode which causes it to count and wrap coins. 

When the mode selector (151) is used to select the wrapping mode, 
the support post m
oving mechanism lowers the coin support 
post (70) by a distance substantially corresponding to the thickness 

of one coin each time the coin support post (70) receives a 
coin during the period between the time that the coin stacking 

device stacks coins in a number that is smaller than a 
predetermined number to be wrapped in one wrapped coin roll 

and the time that the coin support post (70) receives the predetermined 
number of coins. The thus constituted coin wrapping 

machine can be made compact and can prevent coin jamming 
with a mechanism of simple structure and wrap coins in a 

desired manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin wrapping 
machine and, in particular, to a coin wrapping machine 
comprising a rotatable disk for receiving deposited coins 
and by a centrifugal force produced by rotation thereof 
feeding out the received coins to a coin sorting passage for 
passing coins of a predetermined denomination therethrough, 
the coin sorting passage, sensor means provided in the coin 
sorting passage for detecting coins, coin stacking means for 
stacking coins to be wrapped, coin support post means for 
receiving coins stacked in the coin stacking means at a post 
waiting position immediately below the coin stacking means 
and supporting them on the upper surface thereof, coin 
wrapping means including a plurality of wrapping rollers for 
winding a wrapping film around the stacked coins supported 
by the coin support post means to wrap them and produce a 
wrapped coin roll, support post moving means for moving the 
coin support post means between the post waiting position 
immediately below the coin stacking means, a post wrapping 
position where the coins supported on the upper surface of 
the coin support post means can be wrapped by the coin 
wrapping means and a post retracted position where the coin 
support post means is retracted from between the plurality 
of wrapping rollers, first wrapping roller moving means for 
moving the plurality of wrapping rollers between wrapping 
roller wrapping positions where the coins are wrapped and 
wrapping roller waiting positions where the plurality of  
 
wrapping rollers are slightly more apart from each other 
than in the wrapping roller wrapping positions and mode 
selecting means for selecting a counting mode which causes 
the coin wrapping machine to only count coins or a wrapping 
mode which causes it to count and wrap coins. A coin wrapping machine is generally constituted so as 
to stack a predetermined number of deposited coins to be 
wrapped between a pair of stacking drums while the coins are 
being supported by helical coin guide means formed on the 
pair of stacking drums in the coin stacking means and to 
feed the stacked coins to the coin wrapping means disposed 
below the coin stacking means, whereby a set of three wrapping 
rollers winds a wrapping film around the stacked coins. However, in such a coin wrapping machine, since the 
coin wrapping means is disposed below the coin stacking 
means, it is difficult to greatly reduce the size of the 
coin wrapping machine and, accordingly, to meet recent 
demands for a coin
