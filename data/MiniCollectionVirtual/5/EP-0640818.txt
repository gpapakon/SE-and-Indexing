<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sensor 10 using a vibrator 11 as a pressure 
detection means is disclosed. The vibrator 11 includes a 

diaphragm valve 12. On both principal planes of the 
diaphragm valve 12, circular piezoelectric bodies 14a and 

14b are formed respectively. On one principal plane of the 
piezoelectric body 14a, a first circular electrode 18a is 

formed. On one principal plane of the piezoelectric body 
14a, a second hollow circular electrode 18b is formed 

outside the first electrode 18a. On one principal plane of 
the piezoelectric body 14b, a third circular electrode 20a 

is formed opposing to the first electrode 18a. On one 
principal plane of the piezoelectric body 14b, a fourth 

hollow circular electrode 20b is formed outside the third 
electrode 20a, opposing to the second electrode 18b. In the 

diaphragm valve 12, an inside circular portion 12a 
interposed between the first electrode 18a and the third 

electrode 20a and an outside circular portion 12b interposed 
between the second electrode 18b and the fourth electrode 

20b vibrate radially in such a manner that they expand and 
contract in the reverse directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure sensor and, more 
particularly, to the same that uses a piezoelectric-type 
vibrator as a pressure detection means. One such pressure sensor is, for example, disclosed in EP-A-0 221 467. As a piezoelectric-type pressure sensor for measuring 
pressure by utilizing the piezoelectric effect, there was 
one that uses a diaphragm valve. In such a pressure sensor, 
the diaphragm valve is made to have a piezoelectric 
characteristic and a displacement of the diaphragm valve due 
to pressure is detected. However, in such a conventional pressure sensor, a high 
pressure could be detected but a minute pressure could not 
be detected. Therefore, the principal object of the invention is to 
provide a pressure sensor that can detect not only a high 
pressure but also a minute pressure.  
 The present invention is a pressure sensor using a 
vibrator as a pressure detection means, wherein the vibrator 
comprises: a vibrating body; a first circular piezoelectric 
body formed on one principal plane of the vibrating body; a 
second circular piezoelectric body formed on the other 
principal plane of the vibrating body; a first circular 
electrode formed on one principal plane of the first 
piezoelectric body and a second hollow circular electrode 
formed on the outside thereof; a third circular electrode 
formed on one principal plane of the second piezoelectric 
body and a fourth hollow circular electrode formed on the 
outside thereof. An inside circular portion interposed 
between the first electrode and the third electrode and an 
outside circular portion interposed between the second 
electrode and the fourth electrode vibrate radially in such 
a manner that they expand and contract in the reverse 
directions. In the piezoelectric bodies, the inside circular 
portion interposed between the first electrode and the third 
electrode, and the outside circular portion interposed 
between the second electrode and the fourth electrode 
vibrate radially in such a manner that they expand and 
contract in the reverse directions, thus even when the 
piezoelectric bodies resonate, the diameters of the 
piezoelectric bodies do not vary and the vibration does not  
 
leak. The vibrator is used as a pressure detection means of 
the pressure sensor, thereby a variation of a resonance 
characteristics can be detected besides the variation of 
pressure due to the displacement. A pressure sensor according to the invention can detect 
the resonance characteristic variation besides the pressure 
variat
