<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a circuit for the automatic testing of channel units (21) such
as found in subscriber loop carrier (SLCÂ®) systems. The circuit is included as part

of the remote terminal (20) of the system and performs type tests, power-up tests and
routine verification tests. The circuit also monitors the subscriber channel, and

connects the subscriber in the event of a ringing signal or an off-hook during a test.
The results of the test are sent to a display unit which can be located at the remote

terminal and/or the central office.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital loop transmission systems and in
particular to a means for automatically testing channel units at the remote terminals
of such systems.In the basic telephone system, signals are sent to and from a central
office to a subscriber on a loop which includes a remote terminal. The remote
terminal includes a number of channel units which provide many functions including
detection of an off-hook condition, conversion between analog and digital signals,
gain, equalization, and balance.It is important for maintenance of the network that the channel units be
tested when they are first plugged into the remote terminal and thereafter at periodic
intervals. In the former instance (power-up testing), it is desired not only to test the
functioning of the unit, but also to identify precisely the type of channel unit being
installed for inventory control.In present loop systems, channel unit testing is typically done from the
central office by sending appropriate test tones through the loop during idle intervals
(see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,964). In more recent systems, a channel test unit is
included at the remote terminal, but, again, testing is controlled by a test controller at
the central office (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,270,030). Such systems, while adequate,
are fairly slow due to the need for control from the central office. Also, previous
testing schemes could not precisely identify the channel units being plugged into the
system. Further, once a test had begun, it was impractical to monitor the tip and ring
conductors of the channel unit under test to determine if an off-hook condition arose.
Thus, the customer could not quickly be reconnected to the network during a test.It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide for automatic
testing of channel units from the remote terminal.EP-A-0 220 019 describes a system comprising a test unit for testing a
plurality of channel units extending between a central office terminal and a remote
terminal.Review of the Electrical Communication Laboratories vol. 31, no. 1,
January 1983, Tokyo, JP, pages 58-63. S. Yokota et al: 'Maintenance and
administration system for DTS-21 digital local switching system' describes a system
similar to EP-A-0 220 019.A method according to the invention is as set out in claim 1 and a
terminal according to the invention is as set out in claim 5. These and other features of the invention are delineated in detail in the
following description. In the drawing:

A method for determining the type of channel unit (21) present in a
remote terminal (20) which is coupled to a central office terminal (10) in a digital loop

transmission system characterised by the steps of:

coupling the channel unit to an automated channel test unit (26) at the
remote terminal;
applying appropriate terminations and detectors (30) from the automated
channel test unit to the channel unit:
applying appropriate digital signals from the automated channel test unit
to a digital path (YR) coupled to the channel unit;
detecting the result signal from the channel unit; and
sorting the resulting signals in order to characterize the channel unit type
according to said signals.
The method according to claim 1 further comprising (Block 905)
transmitting an AC tone to the digital path and determining the round trip transmission

loss of the return signal from the channel unit.
The method according to claim 2 further comprising (Block 1001)
transmitting a square wave signal on the digital path.
The method according to claim 1 further comprising (Block 906)
determining the presence of a battery voltage on the connection between the automated

channel test unit and channel unit at specified intervals.
A remote terminal, comprising:

a plurality of channel units (21); and
a test system (26, 27, 29); said test system (26, 27, 29) including and
characterized by
an automated test unit (26) for applying appropriate terminations and
detectors (30) to test said channel units, applying digital signals to one of said channel

units, detecting resulting signals from said channel unit, and determining a channel unit
type based on said detected resulting signals.
