<ABSTRACT>
A location system for tracking miners underground includes a number of 
identification stations connected to a central control station. Miners are 

issued with portable identification modules which are fitted to their caplamps 
and which are powered by their battery packs. The identification modules 

transmit unique identification signals at intervals, which are picked up by the 
identification stations. The identification modules change the intervals 

between successive transmissions continually, and the identification stations 
can read overlapping transmissions, so that the reliability of detection is good. 

Miners who are issued with a caplamp first pass an identification card through 
a reader, which reads a unique personal identification code from the card. 

This code is correlated with the identification code of the identification 
module in the caplamp at the central control station. The invention includes 

a portable location device for tracking lost miners, which is a direction finding 
receiver adapted to receive and display the identification code transmitted by 

the identification module of a lost miner. The identification codes of 
members of a search party are stored in the device, so that they are ignored 

in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a location system which can be used, for example, 
to locate personnel or vehicles in an underground mine. Various location systems are known which use passive transponders or low-powered 
active devices with miniature internal batteries. Such devices have 
very short operating ranges, of the order of 1 m or less. This requires 
identification or location systems using such devices to rely on movement 
restricting systems such as turnstiles or automatic doors to channel personnel 
issued with the devices past an identification station. In certain environments, such as underground mines, such impediments to free 
movement may be impractical or may be unacceptable for safety reasons. In 
addition, it may be desirable to implement a more flexible location system, which 
is difficult if identification stations include movement restricting structures 
such as those referred to above. Document EP-A-0 333 459 discloses a system for tracking individual subjects in a plurality of areas according to the preamble of independent claim 1. According to a first aspect of the invention a location system comprises a 
plurality of portable identification modules, a plurality of identification 
stations, and a control station, each identification module comprising: 
a transmitter; and first processor means arranged to store an identification code and to 
enable the transmitter periodically to transmit an output signal 
including the identification code, with an interval between the  
 
transmission of successive output signals which varies from one 
transmission to the next;  
each identification station comprising: 
a receiver for receiving the transmitted identification code from each 
of the identification modules; at least one second processor means adapted to identify valid 
identification codes received by the receiver and to output the 
identified codes; and a communications interface arranged to transmit the identified codes 
to the control station together with an identification station code 
corresponding to the respective identification station;  
the control station comprising: 
third processor means for receiving codes from identification stations 
and generating a display signal according to the identification modules 
detected by respective identification stations; and display means for providing a display indicating the positions of the 
identification modules,  
characterised in that at least one identification station serves as a 
reporting station and includes: 
token reading
