<ABSTRACT>
An incandescent lamp (10) with shock resisting supports yielding an 
incandescent lamp with a heavy filament (12) sturcture supported by two 

support rods (14,16) protected by a shock conditioning spacer (38) comprising 
a sleeve (40) positioned in a hollow leg (22) around the support rod and a 

separator (42) positioned intermediate the sleeve (40) and the inside wall 
of the hollow leg (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electric lamps and 
particularly to large wattage incandescent lamps. More 
particularly the invention is concerned with a support 
structure to position a filament securely and deter damage 
to the lamp seal. Large wattage filament lamps use heavy filaments to 
produce large amounts of light. A large amount of heat is 
also produced, so it is necessary to enclose the filament in 
a large volume envelope. The filament is then mechanically 
supported, and electrically connected in the large volume by 
long metal rods. The heavy filament structure on the end of 
the long support rods produces a relatively large moment 
that can bend or twist the supports, or misalign the 
filament. This twisting and bending can also break down the 
seal structure of the lamp, where the metal rods, acting as 
electrical conduits pass through the envelope to the 
exterior. It is therefore common practice to include spring 
arms or similar braces that extend from the filament 
supports to the inside wall of the envelope. These braces 
limit the amount of sway the filament can go through, and 
therefore limit the amount of twisting-or bending that can 
be applied to the seal structure. There is then a general 
need for an incandescent lamp with shock resisting supports. High wattage studio lamps require substantial support 
of the filament throughout the lamp's life. Unlike stadium 
lights, or other large wattage fixed position lamps, studio  
 
lamps are treated roughly. They are frequently moved from 
one set to another, and similarly repositioned on a set. 
Unfortunately, the standard metal supports cannot maintain 
the needed support since in time the temperature eliminates 
the spring tension. The high operation temperature anneals 
the metal springs over their life, and they loose their 
ability to cushion the filament structure. This is 
particularly true of smaller, more highly tensed springs. 
Spring systems then tend to be effective only during the 
early life of the lamp. Large spring structures are 
additionally more costly due to the design and assembly 
complexity, and the larger material cost. The interaction 
between the metal supports and the envelope can also abrade 
the envelope, and making a possible failure point on the 
glass envelope. There is then a need for an improved 
support structure for studio lamps. To extend the life of a filament lamp, or alternatively 
to increase its luminous output, halogens are commonly 
included in the envelope. The halogen chemical cycle is 
well

An incandescent lamp with shock resisting supports 
comprising: 


a) an electric filamentary light source (12) 
b) a first support rod (14) mechanically supporting at least a 
portion of the light source, 
c) an envelope (20) enclosing the light source, and including 
at least one hollow leg (22) with an inside wall encircling 

a portion of the first support rod, 
d) a spacer (38, 40, 42) positioned in the hollow leg intermediate the 
support rod and the hollow leg to limit motion of the 

support rod with respect to the hollow leg, 
e) a seal (34) to seal between the support rod and the leg, 
and; 
f) electrical connections (14, 16, 50, 52) sealed through the envelope and 
connected to the light source to provide electric 

power for the light source. 
The lamp in claim 1, wherein the spacer is a metal 
sleeve (38) positioned in the hollow leg and around the 

support rod. 
The lamp in claim 1, wherein the spacer comprises a 
sleeve (40) positioned in the hollow leg and around the 

support rod, and a separator (42) positioned intermediate the 
sleeve and the inside wall of the hollow leg. 
The lamp in claim 3, wherein the envelope is composed of 
substantially of silica, the sleeve (40) is composed of 

substantially of silica, and the separator (42) is composed 
of a metal. 
The lamp in claim 4, wherein the metal is tungsten. 
The lamp in claim 3, wherein the separator is a metal 
wire encircling the sleeve at least one time. 
The lamp in claim 6, where in the metal wire separator 
is a coil with a coil diameter sufficiently small to  

  
 

cause the separator to cling to the sleeve. 
The lamp in claim 3, wherein the gap between the rod and 
the inside wall of the leg is substantially filled by 

the spacer. 
The lamp in claim 3, wherein the gap between the rod and 
the inside wall of the leg is substantially filled by 

the sleeve and the separator. 
The lamp in claim 1, wherein the spacer is at least 
partially positioned along the rod by a block (44) 

restricting motion of the spacer in the direction 
towards the light source. 
The lamp in claim 7, wherein the block comprises a wire 
frictionally engaged to the rod. 
The lamp in claim 11, wherein the wire is frictionally engaged to 
the rod adjacent an end of the spacer or sleeve, respectively. 
The lamp in claim 1, having a second similarly formed 
second leg (
24), second support rod (16), second spacer and second 
seal between the second leg and second support rod are 

included and the support rod and second support rod 
comprise the electrical connections for the light 

source.
