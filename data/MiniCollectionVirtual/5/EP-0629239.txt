<ABSTRACT>
Novel polypeptides are isolated from the venom of the parasitic wasp, Bracon hebetor, and are designated Brh-I to Brh-V. These polypeptides are paralytic and/or toxic to insects. The entire amino acid sequence of Brh-I and the DNA encoding it is also determined. These polypeptides may be cloned into a baculovirus, and used for insect control.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to toxins active against insects which are isolated from the
parasitic wasp Bracon hebetor, the nucleic acids which encode the toxins, cloning of the toxins,
use of the toxins to control insects, and genetically engineered virus vectors carrying the toxin
gene.In recent years, venoms of insects and arachnids, in particular spiders and scorpions,
have been investigated as a potential source of biologically active substances for use in various
fields such as medicine and agriculture. Examples of such work include:

Borkovec et al., Eds. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ 397-408.Bracon hebetor (also known as Habrobracon hebetor and Microbracon hebetor) is a
small (ca. 2 mm, less than 1 mg) ectoparasitic wasp, which has a venom that is paralytic to
lepidopterans (Drenth, D. 1974, Toxicon 12:189-192). The quest to identify toxins in B.hebetor venom has continued for several years (see, e.g. Visser et al, 1976, Toxicon 14:357-307;
Visser et al, 1983, Comp. Biochem, Physiol, 75B:523-530; and Spanjer et al, 1977,
Toxicon 15:413-421). Most attempts have been frustrated by the lability of the toxins. Two
protein toxins (mol. wt. 44 and 57 kda) have been purified and partially characterized, but they
represent only 2% of the original insecticidal activity (Visser et al, supra, 1983). More
recently, Slavnova et al, 1987 Doklady Akademii Nauk USSR 297:492-494 reports isolation
of a toxin having a mass of 18 kda.It has now been found that certain polypeptides, when isolated from the venom of the
wasp Bracon hebetor are toxic, i.e. paralytic and/or lethal to insects, particularly of the order
Lepidoptera, at surprisingly low concentrations.The present invention, therefore, concerns toxins
