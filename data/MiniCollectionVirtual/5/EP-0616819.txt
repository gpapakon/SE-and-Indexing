<ABSTRACT>
A pacemaker has means for producing first and second 
signals one of which changes rapidly in response to 

changes in exercise level but may inaccurately 
represent the appropriate pacing rate. Such signal 

may be derived from a vibration sensor. The second 
signal accurately represents the required pacing rate 

but changes slowly in response to exercise level and 
may represent any of a number of different 

physiological variables, such as respiratory rate. 
The signals may be derived from the same or separate 

sensors. A control circuit provides a pacing rate 
appropriate to resting conditions if the first signal 

has a value less than a threshold regardless of the 
value of the
 second signal. The pacing rate is 
elevated to a predetermined level, such as 95 

beats/min, if the first signal exceeds the threshold 
but the second signal has a value indicative of a 

pacing rate less than the predetermined level. The 
pacing rate is further elevated to substantially equal 

that indicated by the value of the second signal when  
 

the first signal exceeds the threshold and the second 
signal indicates a rate higher than the predetermined 

rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cardiac pacemaker.In the normal healthy individual the output of blood
by the heart is varied continuously to meet the
metabolic demands of the body. The cardiac output
changes with variations in the heart rate and the
volume of blood pumped at each heart beat. The
cardiac output is the product of these two variables.
During strenuous exercise a four or five fold increase
in cardiac output may be required. Approximately 75%
of this increase is achieved by elevation of the heart
rate.Patients with cardiac disease resulting in very slow
heart rates frequently require treatment in the form
of an implanted artificial pacemaker. This consists
of a small electrical pulse generator that is
connected to the heart by an insulated electrode lead,
usually positioned in the right ventricle.Until recently the majority of such pacemakers were
relatively simple devices that provided a constant
frequency of stimulation. These suffer from the 
disadvantage that they are unable to increase the
heart rate during exercise, thereby limiting the
degree of exertion that the patient is able to
undertake. This drawback has led to the development
of two forms of pacemaker that can increase
stimulation rate during exercise. The "ideal" system
is a dual chamber pacemaker which has a second lead
implanted in the right atrial chamber of the heart.
This detects the rate of the heart's natural pacemaker
and enables the artificial pacemaker to provide normal
physiological changes in heart rate. However, such
systems are not suitable for many patients and also
have inherent technical and economic disadvantages.An alternative approach that has been developed during
recent years is the single chamber rate-responsive
pacemaker. The fundamental principles of this device
are as follows:
(A) A sensor is used to detect changes in a
biological variable that are directly or
indirectly proportional to the level of
metabolic activity in the body. Evoked QT
interval, respiratory rate, mixed venous
temperature and body vibration are the main 
variables that are sensed by currently available
rate-responsive pacemakers.(B) The output from the sensor is processed by
electronic circuitry to provide a signal that
can be used to vary the stimulation rate
provided by the pacemaker. This circuitry is
designed to perform a series of mathematical and
logical functions that are known collectively as
the rate-response algorithm.The two principal functions of the rate-responsive
algorithm are:
i) To determine the recognition

A pacemaker, comprising a single sensor (3) for
generating an output signal in response to detected

activity, and a signal processing means (60,62) for
processing said signal and characterised in that said

processing means produces a first output signal
representative of a first biological variable which

changes relatively rapidly in response to changes in a
patient's exercise level but may inaccurately represent

the pacing rate appropriate to said exercise level, and
a second output signal representative of a second

biological variable which changes relatively slowly in
response to changes in exercise level but after having

changed relatively accurately represents the required
pacing rate, and control means responsive to the first

signal to provide a limited but rapid change in pacing
rate, and responsive to the second signal to provide

longer term control of the pacing rate.

control means are operative:

said first signal has a value less than a threshold;
(B) to provide a predetermined pacing rate higher

exceeds said threshold and the second signal has a value
indicative of a pacing rate less than said predetermined

rate; and
(C) to provide a pacing rate substantially equal to
