<ABSTRACT>
A kit of parts for making a frame for supporting a canvas, a frame assembled from said parts and an artist's canvas comprising a canvas mounted on said frame are provided. In order to allow the assembly of a frame (38) of any desired size, it is foreseen that the end-user may cut and mitre one or more frame members (31) to the required lengths. Canvas is secured to the frame members and is then stretched by the insertion of wedges (39) between the frame members.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FRAME FOR SUPPORTING CANVASThis invention relates to a kit of parts for making a frame for supporting a canvas, a frame assembled from said parts and an artist's canvas comprising a canvas/* 5 mounted on said frame.Conventionally, artist's canvas are prepared by securing a canvas on a frame which is then expanded to tension the canvas. Typically, the frame is made from a kit of parts comprising four mouldings the ends of which10 are each provided with a tenon which engages in a mort¬ ice in the adjacent mounding when the frame is assem¬ bled. Thus each end of each length of moulding is provi¬ ded with a mortice and a tenon. In addition, the faces of each end of each moulding are mitred. In use, the15 mouldings are assembled to form a frame. A canvas is then secured to the frame and is tensioned by inserting wedges between the tenons and mortices as required.Whilst this arrangement has been used for many years it has the disadvantage that highly specialized20 equipment is required for cutting and shaping the ends of each moulding. As a result, frames are relatively expensive and, more importantly, are only available in a limited number of sizes determined by the manufacturer. Although frames can be obtained to a required size they25 are very expensive and usually involve a delay of sev¬ eral weeks to obtain.The present invention, as least in its preferred embodiments, aims to provide a kit of parts which can be readily adapted for making a frame of desired size.30 According to the present invention there is provi- ded a a kit of parts for making a frame for supporting a canvas, which kit comprises at least one moulding having a groove extending therealong and at least one plate insertable in said groove.35 Preferably, said plate has two edges which areSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

provided with teeth.In one embodiment, said plate is of substantially triangular shape.In another embodiment, said plate is of substanti- ally truncated triangular shape.Preferably, said plate and/or said groove is ta¬ pered.Advantageously, said kit includes four plates.Preferably, said groove is defined between a first portion and a second portion and said second portion extends beyond said first portion.If desired said kit may include four lengths of moulding which may be mitred so that the frame may be constructed to a standard size if required. Preferably, the kit includes at least one packing piece which may comprise, for example a wedge. However, the packing piece may be formed from one or more pieces which are not
