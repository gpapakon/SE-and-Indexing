<ABSTRACT>
A multiple chamber container (10) for mixing and administering a plurality of products. The container (10) has at least two chambers (24, 26) separated by a seal line (22). A frangible connector (36) is situated between the two chambers (24, 26) for mixing the products contained within the chambers as desired. Each chamber (24, 26) has at least one port (28, 32) for filling of product into the chamber. The ports (28, 32) are located on the same exterior side of the container such that the chambers can be filled without folding the bag and by using existing filling equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
multiple chamber container. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a flexible bag for storing a medical 
product having two or more chambers each containing a 
solution or other product. It is known to house a number of different products 
in flexible containers. For example, in the medical 
field, it is known to house enteral, intravenous, and 
peritoneal solutions in flexible containers. Generally, 
medical solutions can be administered directly to a 
patient through a port that provides fluid communication 
to an interior of the container. Often, one or more solutions or ingredients are 
combined to form a solution to be administered to the 
patient. Combined medical solutions may be typically 
unstable. Degradation of mixed solutions can occur 
during the manufacturing process, for example during 
sterilization. Likewise during long term storage such 
products may degrade or suffer reduced efficacy. For 
example, amino acid and dextrose may be combined to form 
a parenteral solution for intravenous administration to 
a patient. If amino acid and dextrose are combined in 
a single container and stored, discoloration often takes 
place. Other examples of non-compatible solutions 
include: bicarbonate-dextrose; amino acid polymers-dextrose; 
bicarbonate-dextrose polymers; and amino acid 
polymers-dextrose polymers. As a result, in some situations, amino acids and 
dextrose are sold separately. If a combined amino acid 
and dextrose solution is prescribed, the amino acid 
solution and dextrose solution must be combined from two 
separate containers. The transfer of fluid from one  
 
container to another can be time consuming and requires 
the use of transfer tubing and/or connectors between the 
two separate containers. Additional risks for fluid 
contamination is also present using such procedures. Containers, therefore, have been developed to 
reduce the risk of contamination and to provide a more 
simple and less time consuming procedure for combining 
at least two solutions. For example, containers having 
more than one chamber for storing a respective number of 
solutions prior to mixing are known. The chambers of 
these containers are segregated from each other, but 
selective communication is possible through the use of 
a frangible seal or closure between the chambers which 
may be opened from outside the container by manipulating 
the walls of the container. An example of such a container is set forth in U.S.

<CLAIMS>
A container (10,50) defining an interior for housing first and second 
products, the container comprising: 


first and second opposed faces (12,14,52,54), each face having first 
and second end edges, the first edges being connected together to define 

one end of the container, the second edges being connected together to 
define the second end of the container and the container having first and 

second opposed sides, each side connecting the first and second ends of 
the container; 
a divider (22,58,40,76) dividing the interior into a first chamber 
(26,60) for the first product and a second chamber (24,62) for the second 

product, one chamber being above the other chamber, the divider 
including a closed valve (40,76) which is openable for providing, in use, 

a communication path across the divider from one chamber to the other 
chamber to allow the products to mix together; 
a first port (32,68) in fluid communication with the first chamber; 
and 
a second port (28,70) provided in the second end of the container 
and opening into the second chamber (24,62); 
 
   characterised by a channel (34) defined by the divider and 

connecting the first chamber (26,60) in communication with the second 
end of the container, the first port (32,68) being provided in the second 

end of the container and opening into the channel (34). 
The container of Claim 1 wherein the valve (40,76) includes a 
frangible member (36,74). 
The container of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the second end is the base 
of the container (10).  

 
The container of Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the second chamber (24) 
has a larger volume than the first chamber (26). 
The container of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the second end is the top 
end of the container (50). 
The container of any preceding claim wherein the second port (28) 
is provided for dispensing the mixed products. 
The container of any preceding claim further comprising a third 
port (30,64,66) in fluid communication with one of the chambers. 
The container of any preceding claim, wherein the container is a 
bag comprising first and second flexible, plastics sheets defining the first 

and second opposed faces (12,14,52,54), said first edges being connected 
together by a heat seal (16), the second edges being connected together by 

a heat seal, the first opposed sides being connected together by a heat seal 
(16) and the second opposed sides being connected together by a heat seal 

(16). 
The container of any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein the container 
is a bag comprising a flexible, plastics web of film defining said first and 

second opposed faces (12,14,52,54), the web being folded and heat sealed 
along three sides thereof. 
The container of Claim 8 or 9, wherein the divider comprises a 
heat seal (22,58) between the first and second chambers. 
The container of any preceding claim further comprising an 
additional port (30,64,66) in fluid communication with at least one of the  

 
chambers. 
The container of Claim 2, or any preceding claim when dependent 
from Claim 2, wherein the frangible member (36,74) is eccentric.
