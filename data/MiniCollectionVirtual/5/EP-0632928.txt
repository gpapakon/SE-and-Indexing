<CLAIMS>
Vacuum switch (1) with a vacuum interrupter (10) 
which has a displaceable connection bolt (15) and with a 

drive device (6) and a lever arrangement, assigned to the 
vacuum interrupter (10), for connecting the common drive 

device (6) to the vacuum interrupter (10), the lever 
arrangement having a two-armed drive lever (51) which is 

connected to the displaceable connection bolt (15) in an 
articulated fashion and which is connected on one side of 

the connection bolt (15) to the drive device (6) and on 
the other side of the displaceable connection bolt (15) 

interacts with a fixed support, in addition with a 
contact force spring (43) and a current loop arrangement, 

formed from a flexible connector (17), for acquiring a 
force which increases the contact force of the vacuum 

interrupter (10) as a function of the current, characterized 
in that the fixed support is constructed as a stop 

face (57) against which the drive lever (51) can be made 
to bear by the contact force spring (43), the contact 

force spring (43) being constructed as a tension spring 
and being arranged between an end part (58), projecting 

beyond the stop face (57), of the drive lever (51) and a 
fixed counterbearing (44), and in that one leg (16) of 

the flexible connector (17) is connected to the 
displaceable connection bolt (15) and is arranged so as 

to bear against the drive lever (51), including its end 
part (58), in a force-transmitting fashion while the 

other leg (18) of the flexible connector (17) is supported 
in a fixed way. 
Vacuum switch according to Claim 1, characterized  
 

in that the drive lever (51) has two legs (52) which 
receive the flexible connector (17) between them and a 

centre part (53) which connects the legs (52) and serves 
as a supporting face for supporting the leg (18), connected 

to the connection bolt (15), of the flexible 
connector (17).
