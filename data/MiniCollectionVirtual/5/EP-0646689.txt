<ABSTRACT>
The rotary lock cylinder has a housing (1) with a longitudinal bore (5), into which a rotor (9) is inserted. Worked into the housing (1) in the lower region of the bore (5) is a groove-shaped recess (11), into which a blocking insert (12) is inserted. The latter projects into the keyway (10) and prevents the possibility of forcibly rotating the rotor (9) and at the same time shearing off tumbler pins. In the event of an inadmissible method of opening, the blocking insert (12) must be held in an inactive position counter to the driving-back force of spring elements (13), thus making such methods substantially more difficult or even impossible.

Cylinder for a safety lock, spring-loaded pin 
tumblers (3, 8) being mounted in bores which extend 

radially relative to a rotor (9) and a cylinder housing 
(1), which pin tumblers can be arranged by a key (14), 

which is introduced into the key channel (10), to release 
the rotor (9), characterized by a catch insert (12) which 

is mounted in the housing (1), engages in the key channel 
(10) and, when the key (14) has been inserted, is offset 

outwards counter to a restoring spring force to release 
the rotor (9). 
Cylinder according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the catch insert (12) is inserted into a recess (11) 

in the housing (1) which is open at the rear. 
Cylinder according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the recess (11) extends essentially over the entire 

length of the housing (1). 
Cylinder according to one of Claims 1-3, characterized 
in that it is a double cylinder which is fitted 

together from two individual cylinders by means of a 
connecting web (7). 
Cylinder according to one of Claims 1-4, characterized 
in that the catch insert (12) has a plurality of 

spring elements (13) which are arranged with spacing from 
one another in the recess (11) and are supported on the 

housing (1). 
Cylinder according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized 
in that the catch insert (12) consists of at 

least two parts (12a, 12b) which can be moved outwards 
independently of one another counter to a spring force.  

 
Cylinder according to one of Claims 2-6, characterized 
in that the recess (11) is wider than the key 

channel (10), and the catch insert (12) is slightly less 
wide in an upper region (12c) than the key channel (10) 

and is slightly less wide than the recess (11) in a lower 
region (12e). 
Cylinder according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that each part (12a, 12b) is pressed against the rotor 

(9) by at least two spring elements (13) arranged with 
spacing from one another. 
Cylinder according to one of Claims 5-8, characterized 
in that the parts (12a, 12b) have bores (12d) on 

the underside, into which bores a helical spring (13) 
engages in each case, which helical spring is supported 

on the housing (1). 
Cylinder accordingto one of Claims 1-9, characterized 
in that the parts (12a, 12b) of the catch insert 

(12) are made of brass.
