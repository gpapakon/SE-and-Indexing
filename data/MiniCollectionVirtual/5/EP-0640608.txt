<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intermediates in the synthesis of cephalosporins. It provides in one
aspect novel amidine salts of 7-Amino-3-hydroxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (=
HACA) which include guanidine and diaza-bicyclo-alkylene salts.Particularly the invention provides a compound of formula

wherein X+ denotes a compound of formula

wherein Y
(i) denotes a group of formula -NR3R4 and
a) R1 to R5 are the same or different and-denote independently of one another hydrogen,
optionally substituted alkyl or aryl orb) two of the substituents R1 to R5, which are bonded to different nitrogen atoms,
together form a -(CH2)2- or -(CH2)3- group and the other substituents R1 to R5 are as
defined above(ii) denotes together with R2 a -(CH2)3- or -(CH2)5- group and R1 and R5 denote together
a -(CH2)3- group.HACA is of great interest as a starting material for highly effective cephalosporins. Position
7 thereof may be acylated to form the corresponding 7-acylamino-3-hydroxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid, and likewise, the hydroxy function in position 3 and optionally the
carboxylic function in position 4 may be changed to form a series of highly effective
derivatives. For example, the active substances

and

may be produced.We have found particular forms of HACA which are particularly useful for economical
synthesis in the production of such cephalosporins. These are stable soluble forms of HACA
in a solvent or solvent mixture which allows derivation to take place in position 7 and, if
desired, subsequently in position 3, without either having to change a solvent or having to
isolate the intermediate stage, for reasons of reactivity of the derivitisation reagents.Surprisingly, soluble forms of HACA have been found in the form of its amidine salts, which
on the one hand are stable despite the high basicity of the corresponding bases, and on the 
other hand are soluble in a number of solvents or solvent mixtures, and thus create many
options in the synthesis of cephalosporin end products or intermediate products, depending
on the reactivity and solubility of the derivitisation reagents.Amidine means also a guanidine which has a further amine group at the carbon atom of the-N=C-N-
group thus being an amino-amidine. Suitable guanidines are for example compounds
of formula II, wherein Y denotes a group of formula -NR3R4 and
a) R1 to R5 are the same or different and denote independently of one another hydrogen,
optionally substituted alkyl or aryl orb) two of the substituents R1 to R5, which are bonded to different
