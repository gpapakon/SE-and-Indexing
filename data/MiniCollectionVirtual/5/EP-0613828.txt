<ABSTRACT>
A box for packaging at least one object (13), said box comprising at least 
two parallelly opposed main walls (1,2), which are interconnected by at 

least one cross wall (3,4,5), whilst the box is furthermore provided with 
a hole (7), which serves to make it possible to suspend the box from a 

rack or the like, whereby at least one pair of aligned openings (6) is 
provided in opposed walls of the box, said openings (6) functioning to 

receive at least one locking means (9), by which the object (13) to be

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a
box for packaging at least one object comprising a
first part having opposite main parallel walls interconnected by cross walls which
extend substantially along the entire circumference of the main walls
leaving open a recess, and a second part for accomodating an object
comprising a main wall and cross walls connected to the edges of said main
wall and oriented transversely thereto, whereby said second part is at
least partly insertable through said recess located between the walls of the
first part whilst at least one pair of aligned openings is provided in
opposed walls of said first part and said second part of the box, said
openings functioning to receive at least one locking means for locking
together the two parts of the box in the closed position of the box, so
that the object to be packaged can be retained within the box.Such a box, known from EP-A-0.458721 is made of two
parts. For placing an object in or for removing an object from the box
the two parts of the box have to be removed from each other. By refilling
the box the parts must be put together again. Furthermore, in using such
a box the object is only covered for a part by the walls of the box. The
object extends on both sides of the recess. Thereby the size of the object
has to be adapted to the size of the box.It is an object of the invention to provide a box which
covers at least the major parts of the object to be packaged, whereby the
parts of the box are inseparable.The box according to the invention is characterised
in that in the closed position of the box the second part of the box is
enclosed by walls of the first part of the box in which closed position
the recess is closed by a cross wall of the second part, whilst there is
provided abutment means comprising an elongated slot in a wall of one part
and a pin being connected to a wall of the other part which pin is movable
in the elongated slot for limiting withdrawal of the second part of the
box out of the first part of the box, and that the box is furthermore
provided with a hole permitting to suspend the box from a rack or the like
and at least a part of the walls of said two parts of the box is
transparent.When the box according to the invention is used, one
or more objects introduced into the box can be retained within the box
by means of the walls of the box surrounding the space accomodating the
object(s). When a box of this type is used the object(s) may be removed 
from the box at the cash desk, where the buyer has to pay for said
object(s)

<CLAIMS>
A box (15) for packaging at least one object comprising
a first part (16) having opposite parallel main walls (1, 2) interconnected by cross

walls (3, 4, 5) which extend substantially along the entire circumference
of the main walls (1, 2) leaving open a recess (18), and a second part

(17) for accomodating an object comprising a main wall (19) and cross walls
(20, 21, 36) connected to the edges of said main wall (19) and oriented

transversely thereto, whereby said second part (17) is at least partly
insertable through said recess (18) located between the walls (1, 2, 4, 5)

of the first part (16) whilst at least one pair of aligned openings (6)
is provided in opposed walls (3, 21) of said first part (16) and said

second part (17) of the box, said openings (6) functioning to receive at
least one locking means (23-25) for locking together the two parts (16,

17) of the box (15) in the closed position of the box, so that the object
to be packaged can be retained within the box, characterised in that in

the closed position of the box (15) the second part (17) of the box (15)
is enclosed by walls (1, 2, 4, 5) of the first part (16) of the box (15)

in which closed position the recess (18) is closed by a cross wall of the
second part, whilst there is provided abutment means (37, 38) comprising

an elongated slot (37) in a wall of one part (16, 17) and a pin (38) being
connected to a wall of the other part (17, 16) which pin is movable in

the elongated slot (37) for limiting withdrawal of the second part (17)
of the box (15) out of the first part (16) of the box (15), and that the

box (15) is furthermore provided with a hole (7) permitting to suspend
the box from a rack or the like and at least a part of the walls of said

two parts (16, 17) of the box (15) is transparent.

openings.
A box according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
said cross walls (20, 21, 36) are positioned along the entire circumference of

the main wall (19) of said second part (17).
A box according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a locking means can be slid through an

opening in the object to be packaged. 
A box according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said locking means
