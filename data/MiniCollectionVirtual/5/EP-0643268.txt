<ABSTRACT>
Device for the recovery of thermal energy applicable to 
a gas cooker, suitable for bounding the perimeter of the 

area where the heat source (flame or electric hot 
plate) is present so as to identify a combustion chamber 

consisting, in its upper part, of the container to be 
heated lying upon said device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention proposes a device suitable for 
recovering a part of the thermal energy wasted in the 
daily use of gas or electric stoves, be they of the 
domestic or "industrial" type. Presently there are no methods or devices capable of 
reducing or recovering thermal energy wasted in the use 
of common kitchen stoves; consumption optimization is 
however more and more the target of manufacturers' 
efforts and therefore cookers with a double flame line 
have been proposed or, in another field, saucepans with 
oversize bottom for storing absorbed heat. Both mentioned solutions moderately improve the exploitation 
of the cooker's flame, but they are not able to 
avoid thermal waste in the surrounding environment, 
especially lateral thermal waste. Direct consequences of such thermal waste are the 
cooker's modest efficiency and the sudden increase in 
temperature in the surrounding environment; if such 
effects can be detrimental in the domestic environment,  
 
in large kitchens of restaurants and canteens they imply 
the use of suction or environmental air conditioning 
systems. To remedy the above-mentioned inconveniencies, the 
present invention proposes a device for the recovery of 
thermal energy wasted in the use of common kitchen 
stoves, be they gas or electric stoves, shaped in such a 
way as to allow a perfect perimetral delimitation of the 
area where the heat source (flame or electric hot plate) 
is provided in order to create a chamber which is closed 
in its upper part by the bottom of the container to be 
heated, placed on said device. These and other features of the present invention will 
be more clearly with the help of the following detailed 
description with specific reference to the enclosed 
figures, where: 
figure 1 represents a top view of a device according 
to the present invention; figure 2 represents the cross-sectional front view of 
the device, taken along plane A-A of figure 1; figure 3 represents a perspective view of the device 
according to the present invention placed on a cooker of 
a kitchen stove; figure 4 represents a cross-section view of the device 
according to the present invention placed on a cooker of  
 
a kitchen stove, with a saucepan placed on it; figure 5 represents another preferred embodiment of 
the invention. As can be seen from figure 4, the device according to 
the present invention basically consists of a body 1 
made of heat-conductive material, essentially ring-shaped, 
in the inner part of which there is a pipe 2 
where a fluid flows
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for the recovery of thermal energy which can 
be applied to a gas cooker, characterized in that a body 

is provided which has to be placed around a cooker in 
correspondence with the heat source, upon which the 

container lies, said body being shaped in such a way as 
to define the perimeter of the area where there is the 

heat source (flame or electric hot plate), in order to 
create a chamber which is bounded, in its upper part, by 

the bottom of the container to be heated. 
A device for the recovery of thermal energy according 
to claim 1, characterized in that it is essentially 

ring-shaped. 
A device for the recovery of thermal energy according 
to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that at least a part 

of the upper wall of said body is level and serves as a 
supporting surface for said container. 
A device according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that under its basis a plurality of small supporting 

feet are provided, said feet being suitable for keeping 
it lifted from the kitchen surface on which it lies. 
A device according to the preceding claims, characterized 
in that a pipe filled with a fluid is provided, 

which extends internally through the whole ring-like 
development. 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the external ends of said pipe are connected with means 

suitable for causing said fluid to flow, storing it, 
controlling its temperature and pressure, making it 

available to an user, exploiting, absorbing and 
transmitting its temperature to another fluid present in 

another circuit. 
A device according to claims 5 and 6, characterized 
in that said fluid consists of water. 
A device according to claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that means connected with said pipe, suitable for 

making the hot water produced directly usable, are 
provided. 
A device according to anyone of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said chamber and said body are 

defined by means of a single pipe bended so as to form a 
series of turn around the heat source. 
A device according to claims 1 to 9, characterized by 
what is described and illustrated.
