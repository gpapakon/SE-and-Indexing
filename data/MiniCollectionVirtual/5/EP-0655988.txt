<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fibrous glass
binders. More particularly, the invention is directed to
a low viscosity binder for application to a fibrous glass
mat, which binder rigidly cures to form a fibrous glass
bat having excellent compression recovery characteristics.Fibrous glass insulation products generally
comprise matted glass fibers bonded together by a cured
thermoset polymeric material. Molten streams of glass are
drawn into fibers of random lengths and blown into a
forming chamber where they are randomly deposited as a mat
onto a traveling conveyor. The fibers, while in transit
in the forming chamber and while still hot from the
drawing operation, are sprayed with an aqueous binder. A
phenol-formaldehyde binder is currently used throughout
the fibrous glass insulation industry. The residual heat
from the glass fibers and the flow of air through the
fibrous mat during the forming operation are generally
sufficient to volatilize a majority all of the water from
the binder, thereby leaving the remaining components of
the binder on the fibers as a viscous or semi-viscous
high-solids liquid. The coated fibrous mat, which is
formed in a compressed state due to the tremendous flow of
air through the mat in the forming chamber, is then
transferred out of the forming chamber to a transfer zone 
where the mat vertically expands due to the resiliency of
the glass fibers. This vertical expansion is extremely
important to the successful manufacture of commercially
acceptable fibrous glass thermal or acoustical insulation
products. Thereafter, the coated mat is transferred to a
curing oven where heated air is blown through the mat to
cure the binder and rigidly bond the glass fibers
together.Phenol-formaldehyde binders are widely used
because they have a low viscosity in the uncured state,
yet form a rigid thermoset polymeric matrix for the glass
fibers when cured. A low binder viscosity in the uncured
state is required to allow the maximum vertical expansion
of the coated mat when it exits the forming chamber. A
binder which forms a rigid matrix when cured is required
so that a finished fibrous glass thermal or acoustical
insulation product, when compressed for packaging and
shipping, will recover to its as-made vertical dimension
when installed in a building.Insulation manufacturers have long desired an
alternative polymeric binder system for fibrous glass
products. However, low molecular weight, low viscosity
binders which allow maximum vertical expansion of the mat
in the transfer zone
