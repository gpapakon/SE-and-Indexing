<ABSTRACT>
A belt grinding assembly (10) for grinding an 
object. An object manipulating mechanism moves an edge 

surface (14) of the object at a uniform rate of speed 
along a path relative to a first direction in which an 

abrasive belt (17) is driven into forceful engagement 
with the abrasive belt (17) as it is driven along a 

contact wheel. The object manipulating mechanism 
includes a wheel (28) rotated at a uniform speed about an 

axis at a right angle to the first direction to 
sequentially move the periphery of the wheel (28) past a 

loading station and then past the contact wheel; a clamp 
including jaws (35, 36) mounted on the wheel (28) for 

relative movement between a release position with the 
jaws (35, 36) spaced to freely receive an object, and an 

engage position adapted to firmly clamp the object 
between the jaws (35, 36); and jaw actuating structure 

that moves the jaws (35, 36) from a release position at 
the loading station, and positions the jaws (35, 36) in 

the engage position during movement of the clamp assembly 
past the support surface (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to belt grinding 
assemblies adapted for use to grind a smooth surface 
on an object. Belt grinding assemblies are known that are 
adapted for use to grind a smooth arc on an edge surface 
extending between major side surfaces on an object or 
elongate bar such as a wrench, which edge surface has a 
predetermined shape when viewed in the planes of the major 
surfaces that may or may not be linear along the length of 
the wrench. Such grinding assemblies are useful to change 
an original rough or irregular edge surface resulting from 
the method by which the wrench was formed (e.g., drop 
forging) into a smoothly arced edge surface that is more 
aesthetically pleasing and easier on the hand of user of the 
wrench than the original rough or irregular edge surface. 
One such grinding assembly comprises the combination of (1) 
a belt grinding assembly including a drive mechanism for 
driving an abrasive belt in a first direction along a path 
past a backup platen fixed to frame means for the assembly, 
which platen has a support surface for the abrasive belt 
adjacent its rear surface that is straight in direction of 
travel of the belt and has a uniform shape corresponding to 
the shape of the edge surface to be radiused in a direction 
at a right angle to the direction of travel of the belt; and 
(2) bar manipulating means for moving the edge surface of 
the bar along an arcuate path about an axis at a right angle 
to the direction of travel of the belt into forceful 
engagement with the abrasive coated surface of the belt 
along the support surface to form the radius on the bar. In  
 
this known belt grinding assembly the bar manipulating means 
is provided by a conveyer including a conveyer belt formed 
by two parallel spaced endless lengths of roller chain, 
metal slats extending transversely between opposite chain 
links, and receptacles for the bars attached to the slats on 
the sides of the slats opposite the lengths of chain; and a 
drive mechanism for the belt including two parallel spaced 
axles each carrying two axially spaced sprockets around 
which the chains were tensioned. Each of the receptacles is 
adapted to receive one of the bars therein with the length 
of the bar extending parallel to the slats and an edge 
surface of the bar projecting away from the slats, and the 
sprockets at one end of the conveyer are positioned so that 
movement of one of the receptacles around the sprockets on 
one of the axles will move a bar in the receptacle in an arc 
into
