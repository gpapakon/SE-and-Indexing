Driving mechanism of a windscreen wiper for an automotive 
vehicle comprising a wheel (3), in particular, a toothed 

gear, driven by a motor (1), wherein one end of a toggle 
lever-type crank drive (4) is eccentrically hinged to the 

toothed gear, and the other end of the drive is connected 
to the wiper shaft in a non-rotating manner, wherein the 

actuated wheel (3) comprises at least two selectively used 
hinge points (9 through 9j) for the crank drive (4) or at 

least one hinge joint (9) adjustable with respect to the 
axis of rotation (12) in a radial direction of the wheel 

(3), or a combination thereof,
characterized
 in that the actuated wheel (3) 
is of an at least bipartite design, with the first part 

(13) being drivable by the motor (1), in that the second 
part (15) of the actuated wheel (3) can be connected to the 

first part (13) in at least two positions staggered with 
respect to one another at an angle, and in that it 

comprises at least two hinge points (9 through 9j) for the 
crank drive (4) staggered preferably by that angle and 

being differently spaced from the geometric axis (20) of 
the first part (13). 
Driving mechanism as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the second part (15) is 
of a multiple-edge-type or cross-shaped configuration and 

that each arm of the cross or each segment of the multiple-edge 
configuration includes at least one hinge joint (9 

through 9j) for the crank drive (4). 
Driving mechanism as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the second part (15) is  
 

a four-arm cross having arms preferably offset with respect 
to one another by 90Â°, with at least one arm being 

orientable or fixable with respect to the first part (13). 
Driving mechanism of a windscreen wiper for an automotive 
vehicle comprising a wheel (3), in particular, a toothed 

gear, driven by a motor (1), wherein one end of a toggle 
lever-type crank drive (4) is eccentrically hinged to the 

toothed gear, and the other end of the drive is connected 
to the wiper shaft in a non-rotating manner, wherein the 

actuated wheel (3) comprises at least two selectively used 
hinge points (9 through 9j) for the crank drive (4) or at 

least one hinge joint (9) adjustable over the axis of 
rotation (12) in the radial direction of the wheel (3), or 

a combination thereof,
characterized
 in that the actuated wheel (3) 
is of an at least bipartite design, the first part (13) 

being drivable by the motor (1) and the second part (15) 
including at least one hinge point (9 through 9j) for the 

crank drive (4), and in that the second part (15) of the 
actuated wheel (3) is configured as a slide which is 

removable from, displaceable and fixable on the first part 
(13) in a radial direction. 
Driving mechanism as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the slide (15) includes 
two lateral mounting tongues (27) each having one elongated 

slot (28) extending in the direction of displacement and 
being traversed by a mounting element (29). 
Driving mechanism as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5,
characterized
 in that the first part (13) of  
 

the actuated wheel (3) includes a stop and/or adjusting 
element (31) engaging an accommodating means (30) of the 

second part (15). 
Driving mechanism as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that the adjusting element is 
a band (31) or a like element projecting in a direction 

transverse to the plane of the actuated wheel (3), and that 
the accommodating means is a window (30) of a corresponding 

size, with an adjusting scale (32) being provided on at 
least one of the edges of the window extending in the 

direction of displacement (26). 
A driving mechanism as claimed in at least one of claims 4 
to 7,
characterized
 in that the inner end of a 
bearing bolt (24) for the associated end of the crank drive 

(4) protrudes beyond the second part (15) and is in 
engagement with a radial groove of the first part.
