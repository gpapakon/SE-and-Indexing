<ABSTRACT>
Plants, such as tobacco, are made resistant to potyvirus infection by transformation with vectors which include a gene, derived from a potyvirus, mutated to encode an untranslatable plus sense RNA molecule. Mutagenized potyvirus genes and plant transformation vectors containing these genes are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the production of
plants with a reduced susceptibility to virus infection.Plant viruses are responsible for major losses
in worldwide crop production. Much effort is directed
towards the development of new plant varieties which
exhibit increased resistance to viral infection. Until
recently such efforts were primarily based on the
traditional plant breeding approach, however this
approach is often limited by a lack of sources of
resistance within the crop species. The advent of
modern molecular biology techniques has facilitated the
development of new methods of rendering plant varieties
resistant to virus attack that are not limited by a
requirement for preexisting resistance genes within a
species.Many of these molecular approaches are based on
the theory of pathogen derived resistance (Sanford and
Johnston, 1985). This theory predicts that a "normal"
host (plant) - pathogen (virus) relationship can be
disrupted if the host organism expresses essential
pathogen derived genes. It has been proposed that host
organisms expressing pathogen gene products in excess
amounts, at an inappropriate developmental stage, or in
a dysfunctional form may disrupt the normal replicative
cycle of the pathogen and result in an attenuated or
aborted infection of the host.Two approaches typify this pathogen derived
resistance: coat protein mediated resistance and
antisense RNA expression. It has been demonstrated that
transgenic plants expressing a plant virus coat protein
can be resistant to infection by the homologous virus.
This coat protein mediated resistance has been 
demonstrated for several virus groups. While the
mechanism of this resistance is not yet fully
understood, it has been suggested that the presence of
the plant synthesized coat protein prevents the removal
of the protein coat (uncoating) of an invading virus
and/or virus movement within the infected plant, leading
to resistance.Plants which express an RNA molecule which is
complementary to plus sense RNA species encoded by the
virus may show a decreased susceptibility to infection
by that virus. Such a complementary RNA molecule is
termed antisense RNA. It is thought that the plant
encoded antisense RNA binds to the viral RNA and thus
inhibits its function.The Potato Virus Y, or potyvirus, family
represents a large number of plant viral pathogens which
collectively can infect most crop species including both
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Potyvirus
infection can induce a variety of symptoms including
leaf

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a plant with a reduced susceptibility to viral
infection, comprising:


transforming plant cells with a DNA molecule that encodes
untranslatable plus-sense viral RNA molecule wherein the untranslatable plus-sense

viral RNA molecule is derived from the nucleotide sequence of a plant
virus gene; and
regenerating a plant comprising the transformed plant cell.
A transgenic plant produced according to the method of Claim 1.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the untranslatable plus-sense viral RNA
molecule is derived from a viral coat protein gene.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the untranslatable plus-sense viral RNA
molecule is derived from a potyvirus.
A DNA molecule useful for producing virus resistant plants comprising
a promoter operably linked to a DNA molecule encoding an untranslatable

plus-sense viral RNA molecule, derived from the nucleotide sequence of a
plant virus gene.
The method of any one of Claims 1, 3 or 4 wherein the untranslatable
plus-sense viral RNA molecule contains at least one mutation that renders the 

RNA molecule untranslatable, and expression of the untranslatable plus-sense
viral RNA molecule within the plant reduces the susceptibility of the plant to

virus infection;

   and wherein the method further comprises the step of selecting a plant
that shows a reduced susceptibility to infection by the virus.
