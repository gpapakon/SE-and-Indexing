<ABSTRACT>
The guide wire is especially suitable for the percutaneous introduction of a balloon-tipped dilation catheter into a blood vessel. It comprises a flexible shaft (1) which has a proximal end and a tapering distal end (2, 3, 4). A flexible spiral (6) surrounds the distal end (2, 3, 4) of the shaft (1). The spiral (6) has a distal part (9) which can be visualised by X-rays, and a proximal part (8) which cannot be visualised by X-rays. The two parts (8, 9) of the spiral (6) are connected to one another by connection means (13). These connection means (13) comprise a connection spiral which is screwed into the proximal part (8) by one end and into the distal part (9) of the spiral (6) by the other end.

A guide wire, more particularly for the percutaneous 
introduction of a balloon dilation catheter into a blood 

vessel, with an elongated flexible shaft (1), which 
comprises a proximal end and a tapered distal end (2, 3, 

4), with a flexible coil (6), which surrounds the distal 
end (2, 3, 4) of the shaft (1) and is attached thereto, 

the coil (6) comprising a distal, radiologically visible 
part (9) and a proximal, radiologically invisible part 

(8), and with connecting means (13) for joining the two 
parts (8, 9) of the coil (6) to one another, the 

connecting means (13) being screwed at one end into the 
distal part (9) and at the other end into the proximal 

part (8) of the flexible coil (6), characterised in that 
the connecting means (13) comprise a connecting coil, 

which is covered at both ends by the proximal (8) or 
distal (9) parts of the flexible coil (6), the said ends 

lying in threaded engagement on their outside with the 
inside of the proximal or distal part (8, 9) of the 

flexible coil (6). 
A guide wire according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the proximal part (8) and the distal part (9) are 

stretched in the longitudinal direction in the region of 
the connecting coil (13), although the gap produced by 

the stretching is smaller than the diameter of the 
connecting coil wire. 
A guide wire according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the connecting coil (13) is stretched in its 

longitudinal direction. 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that wires (18, 19) of the proximal part 

and of the distal part (9) abut bluntly against one 
another in the region of the connecting coil (13) 

(Fig. 1b).  
 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that the connecting coil (13) comprises 
a plurality of turns, preferably approximately six to 

eight turns. 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the connecting coil (13) is 

manufactured from a radiologically visible wire, for 
example for a gold-plated tungsten wire. 
A guide wire according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the wire of the connecting coil (13) has an external 

diameter of 0.05 to 0.10 mm. 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the connecting coil (13) is 

soldered to the distal part (9) and the proximal part 
(8). 
A guide wire according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the connecting coil (13) is soldered along its outer side 

to the distal part (8) and the proximal part (9). 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the shaft (1) is securely connected 

at its distal tip to the coil spring (6) by means of a 
plasma welding site (5). 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the proximal part (8) is connected 

to the shaft (1) by means of an adhesive point (15). 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the proximal part (8) is 

manufactured from a non-corrosive steel wire (18).  
 
A guide wire according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the distal part (9) and the 

proximal part (8) have the same external diameter.
