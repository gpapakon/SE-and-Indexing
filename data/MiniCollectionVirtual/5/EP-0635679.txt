<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an injection and control device for burners of heating appliances equipped with an air/gas mixing pipe (4) comprising a Venturi element (5). According to the invention, the means of injection comprise at least two injectors (13, 18) arranged with their injection nozzles staggered longitudinally and oriented in such a manner that the axis of their flows converges towards the focus of the Venturi element (5). Furthermore, one of the injectors (13), called the first-stage injector, is calibrated so as to give an injection rate corresponding to a minimum idling state, and is connected so as to be fed constantly with gas. Moreover, the means of control (16) are adapted to modulate the feed of each other injector (18), called the second-stage injector, so as to obtain the desired power.
