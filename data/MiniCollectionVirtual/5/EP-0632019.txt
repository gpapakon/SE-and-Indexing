<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a group of chemical 
compounds which inhibit cell adhesion (for example, platelet 
aggregation), to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them. A variety of diseases involve cell adhesion during their 
development. For example, platelet aggregation is involved in the 
formation of blood thrombi, which can lead to diseases such as 
thrombosis, (for example stroke and thrombotic events accompanying 
unstable angina and transient ischaemic attack), myocardial infarction, 
atherosclerosis, thromboembolism and reocclusion during and after 
thrombolytic therapy. It is widely believed that the platelet membrane glycoprotein 
IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) mediates platelet aggregation. Adhesion 
molecules such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor are believed to 
bind to GPIIb-IIIa sites on adjacent platelets and thereby cause them 
to aggregate. Other adhesion molecules which are known to bind to 
GPIIb-IIIa are fibronectin, vitronectin and thrombospondin. Compounds which inhibit platelet aggregation and the binding 
of adhesion molecules to GPIIb-IIIa are known, for example from United 
States patents numbers 5,039,805 and 5,084,466, Canadian patent 
applications numbers 2,008,116, 2,037,153 and 2,061,661, and Alig et 
al., J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 4393-4407. Commonly the structures of 
these compounds are based upon the binding regions of the adhesion 
molecules, which are peptides. For example, a portion of fibrinogen 
which is believed to bind to GPIIb-IIIa is the amino acid sequence RGD 
(arginyl glycyl aspartate). The ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and to inhibit 
the binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb-IIIa has now been found to be 
possessed by certain acid derivatives containing an acylureido group. According to one aspect, therefore, the present invention 
provides a compound of the general formula I (formula set out at the 
end of the description together with the other formulae referred to 
herein by Roman numerals) 
wherein 
R1 represents a group of formula II or III in which  
 A is attached meta or para to the position where the group CONR2CONR3 
is attached and is selected from aminomethyl, guanidino and RaN=C(NH2)- where Ra is hydrogen or phenyl which is unsubstituted or 
substituted by 1 or 2 of halogeno, (1-4C)alkyl, (1-4C)alkoxy, cyano 
and nitro, E is CH or N, Z1 is hydrogen, halogeno, (1-4C)alkyl, (1-4C)alkoxy, cyano or nitro, T is N or CH and X3 is a bond, (1-4C)alkylene or, when T is CH, oxy(1-3C)alkylene; R2 and
