<ABSTRACT>
An accessory pathway detecting apparatus measures action potentials from first 
and second electrode leads (1,5), and outputs the obtained action potentials, as potential 

maps, to a CRT (46) or a printer (47) such that the action potentials can be displayed in 
the form of a list. An ablation catheter (70) is inserted and located at a preexcitation 

portion obtained from the display, and the impedance between each of the electrodes (L1 
to L12, R1 to R12) of the first and second electrode leads (1,5) and the electrode (74) of 

the ablation catheter (70) is measured by an impedance measuring circuit (52). A point 
where the lowest impedance is measured is regarded as an accessory pathway portion. 

The ablation catheter (70) is fixed at this point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an accessory
pathway detecting apparatus for detecting the accessory
pathway in the heart in performing a surgical treatment
for a tachycardia arrhythmia such as the Wolf-Parkinson-White
syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia.With the recent advances in electrophysiological
test techniques for the heart, medical treatments for
arrhythmias have been greatly improved. For example,
instead of excision of an accessory pathway portion by
conventional open heart surgery, a non-open heart
surgery method, which imposes less burden on a patient,
has been employed. In this method, catheter ablation is
performed as follows. An ablation catheter is
percutaneously inserted into the heart so as to
cauterize an accessory pathway portion by irradiating
energy on the accessory pathway portion.Since tachycardia arrhythmias occur owing to the
presence of an accessory pathway other than a normal
stimulus conduction pathway in the heart, these
treatments are performed by excising or intercepting the
accessory pathway by means of cauterization or the like.
For this reason, in performing a treatment by means of 
catheter ablation, the position of an accessory pathway
must be specified before cauterization. In a
conventional electrophysiological test method, a
catheter electrode is inserted into a blood vessel
around an atrioventricular annulus in which the
accessory pathway exists, an electrical stimulus is
applied in the ventricle, and the conduction time of the
stimulus is measured. The position of the catheter
electrode is sequentially shifted to measure stimulus
conduction times at a plurality of portions, and a
potential map is manually formed on the basis of this
measurement result. A portion exhibiting an abnormal
stimulus conduction time is specified as the accessory
pathway portion on the basis of this potential map.When the accessory pathway portion is confirmed
upon formation of the potential map, the ablation
catheter is guided to a position near the accessory
pathway portion (portion to be cauterized) under X-ray
fluoroscopy to conduct the above electrophysiological
test again by using an electrode mounted on the ablation
catheter. With this operation, the accurate position of
the accessory pathway portion is specified, and the
ablation catheter is fixed thereat.In the above conventional method, the operator
conducts tests while checking the position of the
catheter electrode under X-ray fluoroscopy. Tests at a 
left cardiac mitral annulus and a right cardiac
