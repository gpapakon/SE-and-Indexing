<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the recuperation of heat from flue gases of furnaces with boiler by cooling the flue gases to below the dewpoint by means of a multi-stage heat exchanger, the subsequent heating of the flue gases to a temperature sufficient for a thermal updraught through the chimney being carried out in a stage impinged by the hot flue gases and preceding the heat exchanger.

Method for the recovery of heat from the
combustion gases (A0) from furnaces for heating

boilers, by means of a medium for cooling the

combustion gases (A0), which medium is led in the
heating circuit as the said combustion gases (A0) pass

through a multi-stage heat exchanger from top to
bottom, with the returning heating medium of the

heating circuit, which medium is ready to absorb heat,
flowing horizontally through the stages of the heat

exchanger and the combustion gases (A0) being cooled to
below the dew point in the last stage of the heat

exchanger, with formation of condensate, and
subsequently being heated to above the dew point in

order to achieve a sufficient thermal uplift in the
flue, with the combustion gases (A2) which have been

cooled to below the dew point being brought, for the
purpose of reheating, into heat contact with the hot

combustion gases (A0), which emerge from the heating
boiler, by means of intersecting of the circuits which

carry the cold and hot combustion gases (A0, A2),
respectively, in the region of the supply of the hot

combustion gases (A0) to the heat exchanger, with the
cold combustion gases (A2) being led horizontally and

the hot combustion gases (A0) being led vertically from
top to bottom, 
characterised in that
 the last stage of
the heat exchanger is acted upon by the medium of a

low-temperature circuit for the purpose of cooling the
combustion gases (A0) to below the dew point, and the

cold combustion gases (A2), from which condensate has
been removed, are, for the purpose of consistently

adequate reheating, passed through a plurality of
reheating channels (7) which penetrate the flow channel

of the hot combustion gases (A0).
Device for the recovery of heat from the 
combustion gases (A0) from furnaces for heating boilers

by cooling the combustion gases (A0) to below the dew
point and subsequently reheating the combustion gases

(A2) to above the dew point, the device having a
heating boiler, which has a heating medium which is led

in a circuit in the heating forward run and heating
return run, and a combustion-gas line for the

combustion gases (A0) leaving the heating boiler for
the lead off into the flue, and a multi-stage heat

exchanger which can be installed in the combustion-gas
line (10), having supply of the combustion gases (A0)

from the combustion-gas line (10) to the first stage
(W1) of the heat exchanger by means of a combustion gas

distribution hood (11), and entry of the combustion
gases (A0) into the first stage (W1) of the heat

exchanger from above and exit of the combustion gases
from the last stage (W2) of the heat exchanger at the

bottom, with each stage (W1, W2) of the heat exchanger
containing connections (101, 103, 102, 104) for the

horizontal lead-through in each case of a medium of a
heating circuit, and with there being formed beneath

the heat exchanger a reversing and collecting chamber
(12) with condensate run-off and a discharge pipe (14)

which is connected to the reversing and collecting
chamber (12) and extends upwards for carrying off the

cooled combustion gases (A2) in the flue (15), and the
combustion-gas line and combustion-gas pipe (11, 14)

which conduct hot and cold combustion gases (A0, A2),
respectively, intersecting one another for the purpose

of heat contact, with the cold combustion gases (A2)
being led horizontally and the hot combustion gases

(A0) being led vertically from top to bottom,
characterised in that
 the medium of a low temperature
circuit can be admitted to the last stage of the heat

exchanger, and in that there is provided in the region
of the supply of the hot combustion gases (A0) to the 

heat exchanger (1) a plurality of reheating channels
(7), which cross the flow channel of the hot combustion

gases (A0), for the leading through of the combustion
gases (A2) which have been cooled to below the dew

point and from which condensate has been removed, for
the purpose of consistently adequately reheating the

same to above the dew point.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in
that the reheating channels (7) are arranged inside the

preliminary stage interposed upstream of the multi-stage
heat exchanger (1).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in
that the reheating channels (7) are constructed as

separate heat exchangers.
Device according to claim 5, characterised in
that, in the case of a two-stage heat exchanger (1),

reheating of the cooled combustion gases, can be acted

upon by the combustion gases which have been cooled to
