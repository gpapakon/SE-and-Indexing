<ABSTRACT>
Injectable implant compositions comprise a biocompatible ceramic matrix present in a fluid carrier, where the ceramic matrix comprises particles having a size distribution in the range from 50  mu m to 250  mu m. Optionally, the compositions may further comprise collagen, where the relative amounts of collagen and ceramic matrix at least partly determine the physical properties of implants formed by injecting the compositions. The fluid carrier is an aqueous buffered medium, typically including an organic polymer base material when there is no collagen present in the composition. The compositions are particularly suitable for repair and augmentation of soft and hard tissues by injection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
preparation and use of biocompatible implant
compositions. More particularly, the present invention
relates to injectable ceramic implant compositions for
soft and hard tissue repair and augmentation.The use of collagen compositions for tissue
repair and augmentation is known. The collagen may be
utilized in a variety of forms, including cross-linked
and non-cross-linked fibrillar collagens, gelatins, and
the like, and may be combined with various other
components, such as lubricants, osteogenic factors,
ceramic particles, and the like, depending on the
intended use. For soft tissue repair, suspensions of
fibrillar collagen have often been used by injecting the
composition to a treatment site through a fine gauge
needle. For bone and hard tissue repair, fibrillar
collagens have been combined with ceramic powders,
such as hydroxyapatite and other calcium phosphates.
These compositions, however, have not been injectable.The use of fibrillar collagen as the primary
matrix material in injectable soft and hard tissue
implant compositions has several limitations. The
preparation of fibrillar collagen suitable for human use
is relatively time consuming and expensive. In
particular, the complete removal of contaminating and
potentially immunogenic substances to produce
"atelocollagen" is a relatively complex and expensive
procedure. Moreover, the persistence, shape retention,
cohesiveness, stability, elasticity, toughness, and
intrudability of the fibrillar collagen compositions
could be improved. Heretofore, fibrillar and other collagens have
been used primarily for superficial soft tissue
augmentation, i.e., near the surface of the skin. For
deep tissue injection, particularly to locations near
bone and cartilage, the use of cross-linked collagens is
problematic, and the use of non-cross-linked collagens is
ineffective.One approach for improving the compositions
utilized for soft and hard tissue repair and augmentation
would be to at least partly replace the fibrillar
collagen in such formulations with a ceramic mineral
material, particularly with hydroxyapatite or other
calcium phosphate minerals. Hydroxyapatite has very low
immunogenicity.The incorporation of such mineral particles in
compositions intended for soft and hard tissue treatment,
however, has been found to be ineffective due to the
difficulty in introducing such compositions to the
treatment site. In particular, the incorporation of
generally available ceramic mineral particles inhibits or
prevents
