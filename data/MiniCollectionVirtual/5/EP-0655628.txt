<ABSTRACT>
Integrated circuit with a magnetic field sensor (MS) which is produced on a silicon substrate (S) with another integrated circuit, comprises a flat coil (T) surrounding the active region (A) of the magnetic field sensor (MS) with its inner winding and produced in a first metal layer (M1) over the silicon substrate (S). The inner winding of the flat coil (T) is connected to a connection strip (SL1) via four inner connection contacts (K1) which are arranged symmetrically with respect to the magnetic field sensor (MS). The outer winding of the flat coil (T) is connected via an outer connection contact (K2) to a connection strip (SL2). The connection strips (SL1, SL2) are produced in a second metal layer (M2). The circuit according to the invention allows accurate self-calibration of the sensitivity and, in addition, fast self-testing. Compensation of the sensitivity variation with temperature and time as well as a non-ideal symmetry of the crossed embodiment of the magnetic field sensor and also of the offset voltage is furthermore made possible.
