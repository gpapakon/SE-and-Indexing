<ABSTRACT>
A gas-tight nickel hydride accumulator (battery) having high oxygen consumption rate and consequently low internal pressure has an electrode arrangement in stack form, in which negative electrodes (2), which are divided in two and have a rough supporting frame (3) as spacer between the partial electrodes (2') provide the oxygen with an internal space (4) having large surface areas for the reduction, and microporous separators (5), which are not gas-permeable, guide the oxygen emerging from the positive electrodes (1) past the front of the negative partial electrodes (2'). Because of the complete filling of their micropores with electrolyte, owing to the capillary action of these micropores, these separators allow even nickel hydride accumulators to be built with cell heights which are otherwise not achievable with alkaline accumulators having fleece separators.
