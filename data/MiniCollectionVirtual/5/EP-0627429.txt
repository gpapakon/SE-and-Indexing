<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to the crystalline isopropyl 
alcohol solvate of loracarbef, and also is directed to a process 

for the preparation of the crystalline monohydrate form of the 
compound of formula (I) 


which includes exposing the crystalline isopropyl solvate form 
of the compound of formula (I) to a temperature of between about 

50° and 90°C and a relative humidity of between about 60 to 
about 100%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of crystalline loracarbef monohydrate.The β-lactam antibiotic of the formula (I)

is the potent orally active antibiotic known as loracarbef.
The antibiotic is described, for example, by Hashimoto et
al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,335,211, issued June 15, 1982.The above compound comes in various forms,
including the crystalline monohydrate form, which is
disclosed in European Patent Publication 0,311,366 having a
publication date of April 12, 1989. Other known solvate
forms of the compound are disclosed in Eckrich et al. U.S.
Patent No. 4,977,257. The crystalline dihydrate form of
loracarbef is disclosed in European Patent Publication
0,369,686 having a publication date of May 23, 1990. As
indicated in the EPO application, the crystalline
monohydrate may be prepared by first suspending the 
dihydrate in water and effecting solution by the addition
of acid followed by the adjustment of the pH with base, or
by the addition of base followed by acid.It has been determined that loracarbef
crystalline monohydrate is a fine "hair-like" crystal which
results in very slow filtration. In filtering the
monohydrate, the crystals tend to from a mat on the filter
medium which prevents or reduces the ability to complete
filtration, such that the crystals must be washed with
water. As loracarbef monohydrate is moderately soluble in
water, (approximately 10 mg/ml, loss of yield results when
such washes are needed.What is needed in light of the above
difficulties is a process for preparing crystalline
loracarbef monohydrate in a more efficient manner, that is,
to avoid the requirement of filtering the crystalline
monohydrate.The humidification of crystalline cephalexin hydrochoride C1-2alkanol solvates is disclosed
in US.A-4775751.The invention is directed to the crystalline
isopropyl alcohol solvate of loracarbef. The invention
also provides a process for the preparation of the
crystalline monohydrate form of the compound of formula (I) 

which comprises exposing the crystalline isopropanolate
form of a compound of formula (I) to a temperature between
50° to 90°C and a relative humidity of between
60 to 100%.The instant invention is directed to the
crystalline isopropyl alcohol solvate of the compound of
Formula I:
In the present solvate of formula (I), the C-2'
asymmetric center has the R absolute configuration.
Furthermore, the instant solvate may encompass the
zwitterionic form of the compound of formula (I). Another embodiment of the invention is a
crystalline
