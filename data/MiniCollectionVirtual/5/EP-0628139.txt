<ABSTRACT>
An elongated hanging rail assembly (10) of the type including a rail (12) having spaced front and rear downwardly converging substantially rigid walls (15, 16) defining a longitudinal recess (14) with an open mouth (18) at the bottom, and a plurality of wedging pieces (25) arranged in a longitudinal series and disposed in said recess between said walls so as to grip sheet material (11) inserted into the mounth (18) of the recess, characterized in that the wedging pieces (25) are interconnected loosely in series as a wedging assembly (13) by means of longitudinal restraining means (26) adapted to confine the wedging assembly to a predetermined maximum overall length, while the wedging piece ends which face one another, of any two adjacent wedging pieces (25) in the series, are permitted relative movement in the releasing or disengaging direction whreby a wedging piece may be disengaged when so desired without causing other wedging pieces to be disengaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HANGING RAIL ASSEMBLY TECHNICAL FIELD THIS INVENTION relates to a hanging rail assembly. The invention is particularly concerned with the holding and releasing in clip-like manner of flexible sheet material such as paper sheets or cards, or plastic sheets or metal sheets, but it is not limited thereto, being usable also for rigid wire frames of two-dimensional form, or rigid metal plates or the like of uniform thickness or having minimal beading or flanges. All said materials, of various thicknesses, fall within the general term "sheet¬ like materials" which the present invention embraces.BACKGROUND ART Various types of hanging rail assemblies have been devised in the past for many different purposes, particularly of the type having an elongated rail from which sheets may be suspended being held alongside one another in series, the rail housing a "floating" wedge-type catch means mounted in liftable manner for permitting the receiving of the sheet¬ like material through a bottom longitudinal mouth of the rail, whereafter the wedge-like catch means returns gravitationally to grasp the sheet in a wedging action. The catch means is retained in a longitudinal chamber in the rail disposed between top wall means and spaced downwardly convergent front and rear walls which define the longitudinal mouth or recess for the sheet material. The wedge-like catch means may take various forms, such as a single roller as described and illustrated in Australian patent specification No. 45,978/85 of J. M. Webber. Such a construction has severe limitations in use, and for this reason it is preferable in most cases to use constructions of the type described and illustrated in U.S. specification No. 3,168,954 of P. Von Hermann which uses a longitudinal series of separate and unconnected wedging pieces so arranged that they function independently to grip various 

thicknesses of sheet material inserted between the wedging pieces and one wall, without disturbing the functioning of the other wedging pieces.Notwithstanding the usefulness of some of the prior art, we have found that there remains a need for a hanging rail assembly which may engage and grip sheet-like materials as effectively as any prior proposals but at the same time will have vastly improved release capabilities as compared with earlier forms of hanging rail assemblies. The invention aims also to provide a novel form of hanging rail assembly which may be used for a single sheet-like article if so desired, or may be used for a number of articles alongside one

 CLAIMS
1. An elongated hanging rail assembly of the type including a rail having spaced front and rear downwardly converging substantially rigid walls defining a longitudinal recess with an open mouth at tne bottom, and a plurality of wedging pieces arranged in a longitudinal series and disposed in said recess between said walls so as to grip sheet material inserted into the mouth of the recess, characterized in that the wedging pieces are interconnected loosely in series as a wedging assembly by means of longitudinal restraining means adapted to confine the wedging assembly to a predetermined maximum overall length, while the wedging piece ends which face one another, of any two adjacent wedging pieces in the series, are permitted relative movement in the releasing or disengaging direction whereby a wedging piece may be disengaged when so desired without causing other wedging pieces to be disengaged.
2. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 1, wherein manually operable release means are provided, being operable to raise selectively part or all of the wedging assembly in disengaging action.
3. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 2, wherein the restraining means of the wedging assembly include flexible cable, chain or other link means between adjacent wedging pieces.
4. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 3, wherein the wedging assembly is arranged to enable it to be pulled taut by its ends to align the wedging pieces, whereby they may be manually lifted in unison in disengaging action when so desired.
5. A hanging rail assembly according to either of Claims 3 or 4, wherein each wedging piece comprises a tubular roller turnable closely about a cylindrical core piece, the link means being connected between the ends of adjacent 


core pieces.
6. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 1, wherein the restraining means of the wedging assembly comprises an elongate connecting rod passing through oversize apertures of the wedging pieces to afford lost-motion actions for each wedging piece, the rod being liftable from normal repose position for a distance before being operative to lift the respective wedging pieces.
7. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 6, wherein the wedging pieces are loosely spaced apart by spacer members having apertures through which the connecting rod extends, the spacer members being of lesser thickness in the engaging or disengaging direction of movement of the wedging assembly so as not to impede the engagement of each wedging piece with the rail.
8. A hanging rail assembly according to either of Claims 6 or 7, wherein the connecting rod is provided with manual handle means operable to raise selectively part or all of the wedging assembly in disengaging action.
9. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 8, wherein the manual handle means comprises a single handle connected to the middle of the connecting rod.
10. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 8, wherein the manual handle means includes a pair of handles, one handle being connected to each respective end of the connecting rod.
11. A hanging rail assembly according to either of Claims 9 or 10, wherein the or each handle extends down from the connecting rod and curves forwardly at its bottom so that upward lifting urges the wedging assembly normally forwardly in the recess when the sheet material is gripped between the wedging assembly and the rear wall of the rail.
12. A hanging rail assembly according to any one of Claims 6 to 11, wherein each wedging piece is of elongate tubular cylindrical form and the spacer members are also of 


elongate tubular cylindrical form, the outside diameter of each spacer member being greater than the internal diameter of each wedging piece.
13. A hanging rail assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the rail is of two-piece construction, the front and rear diverging walls being on respective parts of the rail and adapted to be joined by interconnecting top wall portions of the two rail parts.
14. A hanging rail assembly according to Claim 13, wherein the two rail parts are metal or plastic extrusions provided with top flange means permitting their interconnection as a snap fit.
15. A hanging rail assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the rear wall of the rail has a front or inner face adapted to be disposed substantially vertically in use, the front wall being inclined down and rearwards from vertical to effect downwardly converging disposition of the two walls.
16. A hanging rail assembly substantially as described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
