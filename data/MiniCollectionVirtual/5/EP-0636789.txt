<ABSTRACT>
A cooling structure (1) for a vacuum device includes an 
external frame portion (11) positioned between vacuum chamber 

flange (21) and cryopump flange (31); a cooling panel (1) 
formed in a partition surrounded by said external frame (11), 

the cooling panel having at least one opening (13, 15) that 
allows a fluid flow between said vacuum chamber (2) and said 

cryopump (3); a cooling means (61) positioned in contact with 
an exposed peripheral cooling panel surface (19) for cooling 

said cooling panel (1); and a coolant feeding means (62) for 
supplying coolant to the cooling means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cooling of vacuum devices.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a method
and apparatus for cooling a vacuum device.A vacuum pump, such as the cryopump 3 shown in Fig. 1, is used
in the prior art to evacuate a process gas from a vacuum
chamber 2 and thereby maintain a stable, selected vacuum in the
interior of the vacuum chamber, while constantly purging the
chamber of expended process gases. Because the cryopump
requires specific operating conditions, it is usually necessary
to reduce the thermal load on the cryopump. For example, heat
transfer to the cryopump from the process gas may be prevented
by a heat shield 41, which absorbs heat from the gas, as well
as any radiation heat. The heat shield 41 is cooled by a flow
of cooling water, thereby increasing the heat shield cooling
efficiency.It is necessary to position a cooling pipe 42 within the vacuum
chamber to provide a flow of coolant to cool the heat shield 41
because the heat shield is located within the vacuum chamber.
Consequently, it is necessary to provide openings in the outer
wall of the vacuum chamber to allow the cooling pipe 42 to be
admitted into the vacuum chamber. The openings must be
airtight under vacuum conditions and therefore must include a
seal 43 to maintain the vacuum within the vacuum chamber
interior. Because the vacuum chamber is used for extended
periods of time, the seal 43 is subjected to repeated stress
and is easily damaged, such that ambient air leaks through the
openings, preventing maintenance of a vacuum in the vacuum
chamber.Because a seal 43 is needed, the vacuum chamber configuration
can become complicated. For example, even when it is only 
necessary to repair the vacuum chamber heat shield 41 and
cooling pipe 42, it is still necessary to exchange the entire
vacuum chamber. Furthermore, if the cooling pipe is damaged,
then cooling water may leak into the vacuum chamber, damaging
both the chamber and any work in progress.It would be advantageous to provide a simple, high integrity
system for cooling a vacuum system that did not suffer from the
above limitations.This object is solved by the method of independent Claim 1 and
the apparatus of independent Claim 2. Further advantageous
features, aspects and details of the invention are evident from
the dependent claims, the description and the drawings. The
claims are intended to be understood as a first non-limiting
approach of defining the invention in general terms.The invention allows cooling a thermal load in a
