<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic actuators such as may be found 
in internal combustion engines and more particularly to a lost motion 
actuator for an electronic valve timing system for internal combustion 
engines. One of the many ways to improve engine performance in motor 
vehicles is by means of electronic controlled valve actuation systems. In 
these systems, an electronic control unit, ECU, receives signals from 
several different sensors in the vehicle such as speed, load, temperature, 
etc., and by means of certain algorithms in the electronic control unit, the 
optimum time to open and close engine valves is calculated. The optimum 
time is converted to an electronic signal, either digital or analog, and 
supplied to a solenoid operated control valve to control the flow of 
hydraulic fluid in and out of a hydraulic tappet or valve lifter. U.S. Patent 4,615,306 issued to Russell Wakeman and entitled 
"Engine Valve Timing Control System" describes a basic engine valve 
control system wherein the opening and closing of the hydraulic valve 
lifters creates pressure pulses in the hydraulic fluid to provide a boost 
pulse to move the lifter to its extreme position. An electronic control unit 
controls the operation of the solenoid operated valve to add or remove 
hydraulic fluid from the lifter to create a fluid link in the lifter transferring 
motion from the timing cam on the camshaft to the engine valve. U.S. Patent 4,223,648 issued to Pozniak et al and entitled 
"Hydraulic Valve Lifter describes a "leak-down" hydraulic lifter wherein a 
Belleville spring valve disc having a thin, sharp edge orifice that is 
operative to sense the oil flow rate between the valve chamber 53 and the 
reservoir chamber 24 to regulate the volume capacity of the pressure 
chamber and therefore the axial extent of the valve lifter as a function of 
engine speed. Actual leakage of the fluid due to the fit between adjacent 
telescoping parts permits the lifter to collapse as the tappet approaches 
the high point of the timing cam. It is well known that in determining flow  
 
through an orifice, as the length of the orifice becomes smaller and 
smaller, the viscosity factor of the fluid in effect disappears from the 
equation. This was recognized in the '648 patent. This patent is 
concerned with the collapse of the lifter at the beginning of the valve 
motion, thus reducing the duration and is not concerned with the closure 
of the valve. As the engine gains speed, RPM, the valve mechanism will 
close faster and the

<CLAIMS>
A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal 
combustion engine having a tubular housing member (42) in a bore (16) in 

the cylinder head (18), a support ring (54) intermediate the ends of the 
housing dividing the housing into an upper chamber (46) and a lower 

chamber (48), a lower piston (36) in contact with the timing cam and 
mounted for reciprocal motion in the lower chamber (48) and biased 

outward by a first bias spring (58) from the support ring to the lower piston 
(36), an upper piston (38) mounted for reciprocal motion in the upper 

chamber (46), at least one inlet (60) through the housing (42) for receiving 
hydraulic fluid into the lower chamber (48), said actuator (14) 

characterized in that said upper piston (38) is biased outward by means 
of a second bias spring (50) and in that said actuator (14) further 

comprises: 

a fluid communication passageway (62) intermediate the ends of 
the housing member (42) between the walls of bore (16) and the outside 

periphery of the housing member, said communication passageway (62) 
intersecting the inlet (60) and controlling the flow of hydraulic fluid 

between the chambers, 
a communication port (64) connecting said fluid communication 
passageway (62) with the upper chamber (46), said port (64) being 

opened and closed by the reciprocal motion of the upper piston (38), 
an orifice disk plate (52) mounted on the support ring (54) in the 
upper chamber (46) and biased against the support ring by the second 

bias spring (50), said disk plate (52) having a plurality of axial flow ring 
passages (72) around the periphery of said disk plate (52) for allowing 

flow of hydraulic fluid from the lower chamber (48) to the upper chamber 
(46) when said disk plate (52) is off of the support ring, 
a shoulder (44) located in the upper chamber (46) for slideably 
receiving the upper piston (38) in its normal position when the engine 

valve is closed and limiting the movement of said disk plate when the fluid 
flows from the lower chamber to the upper chamber, and 
a thin orifice (66) centrally located in said orifice disk plate (52) for 
controlling the flow of hydraulic fluid from the upper chamber (46) to the  

 
lower chamber (48) when the upper piston (38) closes said 

communication port (64) providing damping of the upper piston during the 
reciprocal movement of the upper piston (38) toward its normal position. 
A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal combustion 
engine according to claim 1 wherein the upper piston (38) has relief 

means (82) on the leading edge thereof, said relief means for gradually 
closing said communication port (64) during damping of the upper piston. 
A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal 
combustion engine according to claim 2 wherein said relief means (82) is 

a chamfer (H1, 80) wherein the axial length (H1) of chamfer determines 
the beginning of damping relative to the normal position of the upper 

piston. 
A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal combustion 
engine according to claim 1 wherein the height of the bottom of the 

communication port (64) above said shoulder (44) determines the 
beginning of damping and the size of said orifice (66) determines the total 

time of damping irrespective of the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid during 
the reciprocal movement of the upper piston (38) toward its normal

A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal combustion 
engine according to claim 1 wherein said orifice disk plate (52) is of a 

predetermined thickness and the surface around said orifice (66) is 
chamfered to reduce the length of said orifice to produce a thin sharp 

edge to said orifice (66). 
A lost motion hydraulic actuator (14) of an internal combustion 
engine according to claim 5 wherein said chamfer is on the side of said 

orifice disk member (52) facing the lower chamber (48).
