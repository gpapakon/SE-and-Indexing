<DESCRIPTION>
Method of detecting microorganisms.The present invention relates to a method of detecting the presence or absence of viable microorganisms in a sample.More particularly, it relates to the use of suitable antibodies which specifically recognise and bind an epitope located on the surface of intact viable microorganisms.There is a need to detect viable microorganisms in food samples, water, air, industrial products, human clinical and animal samples as rapidly as possible. It is also desirable to identify genus and species at the same time.A number of ways to improve upon the traditional culture methods have more recently been developed. Thus, to accelerate the bacterial identification process, highly specific polyclonal and preferably monoclonal antibodies have been developed that can be used in immunodiagnostic tests, such as an ELISA test. In the ELISA test a sample of culture medium is added directly to an antibody coated tube and the specific microorganisms in the culture medium are thus immobilised onto the surface of the coated tube, where they can be detected by means of a second, labelled antibody.The ELISA test suffers a disadvantage compared to the extended culture procedure discussed below. The sensitivity of the best ELISA4 5 tests currently available is about 10 to 10 organisms per mi11i- litre. At microorganism concentrations below this range the test will be negative and the microorganisms will not be detected. In contrast, culture procedures should be able to detect a single bacterium. Since the ELISA tests currently available are a rela¬ tively less sensitive technique, they still require one or more culture steps in order to enrich the number of microorganisms present in the sample before the ELISA test is carried out. Often these additional culture steps can take 16 hours or more.The traditional culture techniques are slow and are now being superseded by rapid detection methods based particularly on ultra¬ sensitive DNA probe and DNA amplification techniques. DNA 

amplifiers, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR) and the DNA/RNA systems, such as NASBA or 3SR, can theoretically detect a single microorganism, and can provide a species identification at the same time.In a production process, such as the preparation of a pharmaceutical or a foodstuff, there is often incorporated a sterilisation step to kill the microorganisms present in the product. Sterilisation steps commonly employ heat, extremes of pH, salt, bactericidal chemicals, irradiation or

CLAIMS
1. A method of detecting the presence or absence of a viable microorganism in a sample to be tested using an antibody which specifically recognizes and binds viable microorganisms, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in contacting the sample with an antibody which specifically recognises and binds an indicator epitope found only on a surface of an intact viable microorganism and does not bind dead but intact organisms killed by a process, and subsequently optionally eluting the captured microorganism using methods known per se and/or detecting or identifying said microorganism using methods known p_er se.
A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in

.
, including detection directly on the solid phase.
3. A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein detection of the microorganism includes identification and/or amplification of the nucleic acid in the organism using a detection or amplification system incorporating known oligonuclotides or analogues of nucleic acid, such as peptide nucleic acid.
4. A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that the antibody is bound to a high surface area solid phase, such as a nylon mesh or microparticles, and the microorganism is present in a liquid sample.
5. A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the microorganism is a bacterium, a fungus or a virus.
6. A method according to claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the microorganism is Listeria monocytoqenes. 


7. A method according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the indicator epitope is a heat labile epitope found on the surface of viable Listeria cells.
8. A method according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the antibody is specific for the detec¬ tion of Listeria cells.
9. A method according to any of the preceding claims, c h a r - a c t e r i z e d in that the antibody is produced from the cell line BAC01A 3B4A3.
10. Antibodies from the cell line BAC01A 3B4A3.
11. The cell line BAC01A 3B4A3.
12. Use of the method according to claims 1 to 9 for detection or identification of eucaryotic cells, procaryotic cells or viruses.
13. A kit for the detection of viable microorganisms in a sample containing an antibody coated solid phase, buffers for dispersing the sample, washing buffers, elution and/or disruption buffers to expose the nucleic acid in the captured microorganism, hybridisation or ampl fication reagents to detect or amplify the exposed nucleic acid, or a labelled second antibody to bind to the captured micro¬ organism in an immunoassay, reagents to detect the hybridised probe or the amplified nucleic acid or nucleic acid analogue sequence or the labelled antibody in an immunoassay.
