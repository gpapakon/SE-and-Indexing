<CLAIMS>
Device attachable to an agricultural vehicle for prepressing 
grass, hey or other soft plant parts lying in swaths, comprising 

two adjacent crushing devices (1, 2) which rotate around 
vertical axes (1a, 2a) and the rotary crushing surfaces (3) of 

which co-act in such a manner that the material to be crushed 
(4) is pulled inbetween the crushing surfaces and compressed 

during driving, and that at least one crushing device of driven 
by a motor, 
characterized by
 a press-on mechanism (10) 
which is rotated in the driving direction in front of and above 

the crushing devices around a horizontal axis (10a). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
adjacent crushing devices are designed as counter-rotating 

wheels (1, 2) with an elastic coating (8) serving as a crushing 
surface. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
crushing surfaces of the crushing devices are arranged as 

rotary belts. 
Device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
wheels (1, 2) comprise a rubber coating (8) filled with 

compressed air. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the wheel coatings (8) have grooved treads (9) arranged 
transversely to the running direction. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the rotary speed of both crushing devices (1, 2) differs. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the crushing devices (1, 2) are mounted on the vehicle so 
as to be height adjustable.  

 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the angular position of both crushing devices (1, 2) 
relative to each other is adjustable. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the gap between both crushing devices (1, 2) is 
changeable. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
press-on mechanism (10) is height adjustable. 
Device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the 
press-on mechanism (10) comprises a sensor which is 

operationally connected to the drive of the crushing devices (1, 
2). 
Device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the 
press-on mechanism (10) is designed as a free-running wheel 

with a rubber tyre. 
Device according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the 
wheel (10) has a periphally narrowing exterior profile (12).
