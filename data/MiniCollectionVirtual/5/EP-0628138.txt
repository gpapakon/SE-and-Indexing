<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with support from the U. S. 
Government under Grant No. 5 R01 HD15434 awarded by the 
National Institute of Health. The U. S. Government has 
certain rights in this invention. The present invention relates to pumps and 
particularly to peristaltic pumps in which a fluid is 
forced through a tube by progressively compressing the tube 
at spaced apart intervals. Pumps of this general type have 
found particular utility in the medical field for 
transferring blood and other fluids between a patient and 
an extracorporeal device. While a variety of pumps have been previously used, 
pumps used in connection with extracorporeal circulation 
are most commonly of the peristaltic type. Medical 
procedures which commonly employ peristaltic pumps include 
open heart surgery for circulating blood between a patient 
and a heart lung machine, dialysis procedures for  
 
transferring blood between a patient and a dialyzer, bypass 
surgery to remove blood from the open thoracic cavity, and 
continuous care situations for the pumping of intravenous 
solutions. Peristaltic pumps are volumetric pumps in which a 
linearly moving or rotating member progressively compresses 
a flexible tube at spaced apart intervals to propel a fluid 
through the tube. A principal advantage of the peristaltic 
pump is its simplicity of operation and the absence of 
contact between the fluid, such as blood, and frictional 
surfaces, such as internal valves, which can be responsible 
for a variety of hazards. Instead of directly contacting 
the rotating member of the pump, the fluid is passed 
through a chemically inert tube. Pumps of this type exhibit certain disadvantages which 
are inherent in the pumps themselves. Current roller 
pumps, often used for pumping blood, are typically driven 
by a constant speed motor which draws blood at a 
substantially constant rate. If a line downstream of the 
pump becomes occluded, the pump can over pressurize and 
rupture the downstream vessel. If a line upstream of the 
pump becomes occluded, the pump can generate dangerously 
low negative pressures, hemolyze the blood, and empty the 
tissue vessel of the patient causing a collapse of the 
vessel and resulting in damage to the tissue at the 
drainage catheter tip. Roller pumps in general are also 
inefficient in their operation. Much of the energy which 
is consumed by the pump is used to deform the thick walls 
of the flexible tubing, an action which in and of itself 
does not contribute to output flow. Furthermore, during 
long
