<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic key operated lock has an anti-rap arrangement which comprises a magnet pin (13) supported in a bar (16) mounted in a slide member (1). The remote end of the pin (13) fits into an aperture (17) in a locking plate (3) and is pivoted to swing downwards out of the aperture (17) when a correctly coded key is inserted into the lock. The correctly coded key has a repelling spot to pivot the magnet as required and before the key attempts to move the slide member from its locked position shown in the figure. Rapping on the face of the lock cannot move the remote end of the magnet pin (13) out of the aperture (17) because it is restrained by its pivoting action from moving laterally out of the locking plate. Another anti-rap arrangement is described with respect to the other drawings and a padlock incorporating both anti-rap arrangements is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to magnetic locks. The invention relates more particularly to magnetic locks 
operated by magnetic cards in which provision is made to 
prevent the lock being opened by sharp impacts or so-called 
"rapping". Early card-operated locks were designed for installation 
inside a wall or door and the key was inserted into a slot 
in a flush-mounted faceplate. Applying impacts to the slot 
or to the surface of the door or wall seldom caused 
unlocking as the pins moved perpendicularly to the plane of 
the card slot, but when the same lock was housed in a box 
and mounted on the surface of the wall or door, or on a 
post for access by car drivers entering a parking garage, 
the top surface above the lock was available for impacting 
and sharp blows could often jar the pins up and down. If 
a non-magnetic card-shaped object was inserted in the slot 
during the "rapping", the lock could sometimes be unlocked. 
Magnetic pin card-operated locks which are susceptible to 
this type of tampering are described for example in USA 
patents 2,566,017, 2,648,729, 2,732,703, 2,769,873, 
2,931,953, 3,271,983, RE27,753, 3,595,042, 3,581,030, and 
3,995,145. USA patent 3,705,277 describes the problem and 
discloses a solution which utilizes a "tamper-resistant 
non-magnetic pin" which, when moved by a rapping impact 
causes the lock to remain locked by blocking movement of  
 
the slider that contains the tumbler pins. Nearly all of the above locks required to be mounted 
horizontally, (parallel to the floor), as the pins were 
held in locking positions mainly by gravity. However, 
where a steel shield plate is used to attract all the 
magnetic pins towards the slot, as described in USA patent 
3,834,197, the lock is able to be mounted vertically. USA 
patent 3,995,460 describes how a magnetic pin can be used 
to block slider movement if the lock is rapped on the front 
surface in direct line with the locking pins. This "anti-rap" 
pin has been shown in subsequent USA patents 
4,133,194, 4,676,083, 4,312,198 and 4,932,228. Padlocks incorporating a magnetic card-operated lock such 
as described in USA patent 3,834,197 are known in the art, 
however this type of lock has not been successfully 
produced due to its possible susceptibility to being 
unlocked without a correct card being inserted, by rapping 
on the body of the lock while a blank card is in the slot, 
and held under constant or intermittent pressure. According to the invention there is provided a magnetic key 
operated lock comprising a slide
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A magnetic key operated lock comprising a slide member 
(1) movable from a locked position to an unlocking position 

with a key having a magnetic code encoded in it inserted in 
the lock, a plurality of magnet pins (2, 13, 31) movable 

transversely of the slide member (1) from a first position 
locking the slide member in said locked position to a 

second position unlocking said slide member on operation of 
the lock by a said key, and a locking plate (3) alongside 

the slide member having a plurality of apertures for 
receiving remote ends of the magnet pins (2) when the slide 

member is in the locked position, the position and polarity 
of some or all of the magnet pins (2) forming a code for 

the lock, at least a part of said plurality of magnet pins (2, 13, 31) 
being slidable transversely of the slide member from said first 

locking position to said second unlocking position, characterised in 
that at least one of the magnet pins (13, 31) is supported in the 

slide member (1) so that its remote end is prevented mechanically, 
even if the lock is rapped, from moving transversely from its locked 

position in which it is received in a respective aperture (17, 39) of the locking plate (3) in use whenever the slide member is urged from the 
locked position towards the unlocking position unless a 

coded key is inserted in the lock which first causes the 
remote end to move out of the locking plate. 
A lock according to claim 1, in which said at least 
one magnet pin (13) is pivotably mounted in the slide 

member (1) about an axis transverse to the slidable axes of 
the other magnet pins (2) so that the remote end can move 

out of the respective aperture (17) in the locking plate (3) by  
 

pivoting in the direction of movement of a correctly coded 
key into the lock. 
A lock according to claim 2, in which the at least one 
magnet pin (13) extends or has a housing (18) extending 

beyond its pivot point and the lock includes a shoulder 
(20) which bears against the extension or housing to pivot 

the magnet pin further in the same direction and into 
alignment with the slide member as the slide member moves 

towards its unlocking position. 
A lock according to claim 3, including a protrusion 
mounted adjacent one end of the slide member (1) which 

engages the extension or the housing (18) when the slide 
member moves from its unlocking position towards its locked 

position to cause the magnet pin to rotate in an opposite 
direction and its remote end to move into its respective 

aperture in the locking plate. 
A lock according to claim 1, in which the at least one 
magnet pin (31) is formed to fit snugly in the slide 

member, so as to be movable in the slide member only along 
a fixed axis, the magnet pin being provided with or having 

a lateral protrusion (32A) at its remote end which is 
arranged to fit flush with a surface of the slide member in 

an indentation (40) in that surface, and the lock plate (3) 
has a stepped aperture (37, 38, 39) through which the 

lateral protrusions can pass and lodge against the step to  
 

prevent travel of the remote end of the magnet pin (31) 
away from the locking plate unless the central axis of the 

magnet pin is aligned with a central axis of the stepped 
aperture. 
A lock according to claim 5, in which the lateral 
protrusion comprises a peripheral rim (32A) at the said 

remote end. 
A lock according to claim 5 or 6, in which the magnet 
pin has a uniform cross-section along its total length and 

is surrounded and held in a separate sheath (32) which fits 
snugly in the slide member, the sheath being integrally 

formed with said lateral protrusion. 
A lock according to claim 7, in which the sheath (32) 
is formed of plastics material.

(13, 31), a first magnet pin (13) which is pivotably 

mounted in the slide member (1) about an axis transverse to 
the slidable axis of the other magnet pins (2) so that a 

remote end of the first magnet pin (13) can move out of the respective 
aperture (17) in the locking plate (3) by pivoting in the 

direction of movement of a correctly coded key into the 
lock, and a second magnet pin (31) which is formed to fit 

snugly in the slide member, so as to be movable in the 
slide member only along a fixed axis, the second magnet pin  

 
(31) being provided with or having a lateral protrusion 

(32A) at its remote end which is arranged to fit flush with 
a surface of the slide member in an indentation (40) in 

that surface, and the locking plate (3) has a stepped aperture 
(37, 38, 39) through which the lateral protrusion can pass 

and lodge against the step to prevent travel of the remote 
end of the second magnet pin (31) away from the lock plate 

unless the central axis of the second magnet pin is aligned 
with a central axis of the stepped aperture. 
A padlock having a magnetic key operated lock as 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 9. 
A padlock having a magnetic key operated lock 
according to claim 1, the padlock including a release arm
