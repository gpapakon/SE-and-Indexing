<ABSTRACT>
Data terminal comprising a demodulator for a FSK phase-coherent 
modulated signal having at least two frequencies, comprising a PLL circuit (10) in 

which a phase detector is combined with a real-time integrator (15) and in which a 
sequencer (5) is included, so that the modulated signal is integrated around the zero 

crossings before a clock signal and digital data are extracted from this signal after a 
phase lock. As long as the PLL circuit (10) is in the unlocked state, the frequency with 

which the integrator (15) is driven by the sequencer (5) is equal to half the bit rate of 
the modulated signal while, for that matter, this frequency is equal to the bit rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data terminal comprising a demodulator for a
FSK phase-coherent modulated signal having at least two frequencies, which
demodulator comprises at least a PLL circuit formed by a phase detector, a filter and a
controllable oscillator as well as a logic circuit controllable by a sequencer for
extracting digital data from said signal.The invention specifically relates to a demodulator suitable for use in such
a data terminal.A demodulator suitable for such a data terminal is known from United
States Patent 4,694,257 and from "Motorola Semiconductor Technical Data. Advanced
Information MC 68194 Carrierband Modem (CBM)", Motorola, 12 February 1986.A signal according to IEEE Standard 802.4 for the Token Passing Bus
method is a FSK (frequency shift keying) phase-coherent modulated sine wave signal in
which a "one" is represented by one full cycle per bit period and a "zero" is represented
by two full cycles per bit period, while furthermore a non-data symbol is defined which
consists of half a "zero" symbol followed by a full "one" symbol terminated by half a
"zero" symbol.With this signal it is possible to transfer data represented by a specific
series of "zeros" and "ones". A message is limited by so-called delimiters which contain
the non-data symbol "N". In addition to digital data a FSK phase-coherent modulated
signal comprises a clock signal which is related to the bit rate. In a demodulator for
such a signal the clock signal is recovered from the modulated signal and the data are
extracted from that modulated signal.In the known demodulator both the recovery of the clock signal and the
extraction of data are based on the detection of zero crossings in the modulated signal
by a phase detector in a phase-locked loop (PLL). A special property of the modulated
signal is utilized for the recovery of the clock signal. The modulated signal has not
more than two frequencies: once and twice the bit rate. When a zero crossing occurs,
the known demodulator generates a one-shot signal having a period of 75% of the one-half 
bit period. With this one-shot signal half the number of zero crossings (edges)
coming from the signal component having the high frequency are masked. The result is
a signal having a frequency that is twice the bit rate. By dividing the frequency of this
signal by a factor of two, a 50% duty cycle signal is obtained having a frequency equal
to the bit rate at which the desired clock signal is recovered.In the known demodulator the data are extracted from the modulated
