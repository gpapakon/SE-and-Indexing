<ABSTRACT>
Cooled rolls for handling and conveying products, especially metallurgical and siderurgical products moving inside a furnace, each of these rolls consisting of a central shaft cooled by water, on which discs are mounted perpendicular to said central shaft, to serve as a support for the siderurgical products, characterised in that there are arranged, around said central shaft (10), one or more screens (14) which ensure thermal insulation, opposing heat transfer by radiation between the atmosphere of the furnace and the cooled shaft of said roll.
