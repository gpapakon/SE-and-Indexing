<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of delay time data can easily be obtained. A 
data input unit 32 successively writes data into a memory 30. 

A data output unit 36 outputs data from six areas a - f in the 
memory 30 in the parallel manner. Selection units SW1 and SW2 

successively select and output data read out from the six 
areas a - f in the memory 30. Locations to be read are shifted 

from one another by the selection units SW1 and SW2 to output 
data from different memory locations. Thus, a plurality of 

data which are different in time between write and readout 
operations (i.e., different delay times) can be obtained 

simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage circuit usable
in a delay circuit which may be used to generate surround-sounds
in an audio instrument.Conventional audio instruments generate surround-sounds
by attenuating and superimposing reproduced sounds with a time
delay. Reproduce modes include stadium mode, church mode and
other modes in which reproduced sounds are superimposed on top
of one another with a time delay through different techniques.A delay circuit used for such applications is exemplified
in Fig. 1. The delay circuit includes an A/D converter 10 for
temporarily converting analog reproduction signals into digital
data which are in turn stored in a memory 12. The delay
circuit also includes a D/A converter 14 for converting the
digital data read out from the memory 12 back into analog
data. If there is a difference between write time and read
time in the memory 12, it will be a delay time.More particularly, a delay time signal can be obtained by
writing data into the memory 12 at an address and reading out
data from the memory 12 at another address spaced away from
the first-mentioned address by a given time period (i.e., a 
location at which the other data has been written before the
given time period).In the church mode, for example, reproduced sounds are
required to provide many echoes as in an actual church. Thus,
a great number of reproduction signals must be generated with
a plurality of short delay times to attenuate and superimpose
each set of reproduction signals one on top of another.In order to provide four different types of delay time
data, for example, data will be readout at four different
addresses (READs 1 - 4) before a data writing cycle is repeated
while sequentially changing the address, as shown in Fig.
2.However, such a process must do four read addressings and
one write addressing through one cycle. If the input data
clock is sufficiently slow, the five addressings do not raise
any problem. However, the A/D converter 10 used in the delay
circuit of Fig. 1 has a very fast clock since it functions to
output signals in the form of a pulse string through the
conventional over-sampling action. When five addressings are
to be carried out within one cycle, it will exceed the capacity
of the memory cell.The patent publications EP-A-0 561 306 and US-A-4 611 299 disclose a storage circuit having a memory which is divided into
several blocks. All blocks in the memory are read in parallel and single selection means selects the data from each block in
sequence. The disclosures do
