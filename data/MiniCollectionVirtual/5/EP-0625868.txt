<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to
apparatus for joining two structural sheets by heating a
bonding material disposed between the juxtaposed edges of
two metal sheets and, more specifically, to electrical
heating apparatus for heating a bonding material to join
two sheets together.The use of a heat curable, adhesive bonding
material to join two juxtaposed structural elements or
metal sheets is widely used in the automotive industry.
Such a bonding technique is employed for doors, deck
lids, hoods and like assemblies in which two metal sheets
or panels are arranged in an edge overlapping manner with
a suitable bonding material placed between the two sheets
before the edge of one sheet is hemmed over the adjacent
edge of the other sheet. Heat is then applied to the
bonding material to cure the material and form a high-strength
joint between the two structural elements or
sheets.It is well-known that the assembly of
automotive vehicles involves high production rates. As
such, electric induction coils have been employed to
provide the necessary heat to quickly cure the bonding
material. Such induction coils carry a high frequency
electrical current which generates a magnetic field and
causes heating of the metal sheets, which heat is
conducted to and cures the bonding material disposed
between the two sheets. Since the hemmed perimeter areas
of doors, deck lids, hoods and the like can be quite
large, it is common to employ such induction coils at
only selected locations along the length of any hem so as
to spot cure the bonding material only at the locations
of the induction coils. The remainder of the bonding 
material is cured at a later time during the assembly
process, such as when the automotive vehicle passes
through a paint oven. It is also known to use induction
coils around the entire perimeter edge or edges of an
assembly to cure all of the bonding material at one time.DE-C-4021025 discloses apparatus for the
surface treatment of workpieces which differ in length or
diameter. The apparatus comprises at least two inductors
for inductive heating of the workpiece surface. The
inductors have perpendicular end-portions which are led
in an arcuate or polygonal manner over the workpiece.A typical prior art induction coil for bonding
applications is shown in Figure 1. In this typical
arrangement, an induction coil 10 is positioned below an
insulating material support 12. The support 12 receives
and supports a hemmed edge 13 of an outer sheet or panel
14 and an inner sheet or panel 16. A strip of
