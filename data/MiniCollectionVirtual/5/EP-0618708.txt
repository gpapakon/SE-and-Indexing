<ABSTRACT>
A computer network in which resources are dynamically
located through the use of LOCATE requests includes multiple

cache server nodes, network nodes which have an additional
obligation to build and maintain large caches of directory

entries. Cache server nodes play a key role in the LOCATE
process and can prevent redundant network-wide broadcasts of

LOCATE requests. Where an origin cache server node receives a
request from a served node, the cache server node searches its

local directories first, then forwards the request to alternate
cache server nodes if necessary. If the necessary information

isn't found locally or in alternate cache server nodes, the
LOCATE request is then broadcast to all network nodes in the

network. If the broadcast results are negative, the request is
forwarded to selected gateway nodes to permit the search to

continue in adjacent networks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computer networks and more 
particularly to methods and apparatus for locating resources in 
such networks where certain nodes in the networks are defined 
as cache server nodes. A computer network consists of a set of data processing 
systems that are connected to one another to enable end users 
at different systems to exchange data. Each system, which can 
generically be referred to as a node, consists of computer 
components (hardware) and computer programs (software) that run 
on the hardware. The systems can be interconnected through a 
variety of electrical or optical transmission media. Such 
media are generically referred to as links. The nodes in a network can be characterized by the functions 
which they perform. An Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking or 
APPN architecture developed by the assignee of the present 
invention employs two major types of nodes, end nodes and 
network nodes. An end node may include input/output devices 
such as display terminals, intelligent workstations, printers 
and the like and a processor which supports the operation of 
such devices. A network node may include the same kinds of 
devices but further includes hardware and software which allows 
it to perform additional communication-related functions. 
Typical network or communication-related functions include 
selecting and setting up routes or paths between remote systems 
and maintaining a directory or database of nodes and links 
throughout the network. The nodes and the links may be 
referred to, collectively, as network resources. The physical 
configuration, logical configuration and characteristics of the 
various nodes and links are referred to collectively as the 
topology of the network.  
 
various nodes and links are referred to collectively as the 
topology of the network. Each of the nodes contains one or more network addressable 
units, each containing a resource that can be a source or 
target for communications directed through the network between 
end users. The term "end user", while usually associated with 
human users, is intended to represent a computer program which 
is executed at a network addressable unit to permit a human 
user at the unit to interact with the network. The term 
logical unit or LU may be used to refer to an interface between 
an end user and the network. If a network node is to select a route or set up a logical 
connection to a particular network resource, the network node 
obviously needs to know where that resource is located and

a request from one of the nodes, the method being performed at 
the cache server node which serves the requesting node or is 

itself the requesting node and comprising the steps of: 

(a) searching resource directories maintained at the cache 
server node for a suitable entry defining the location and 

characteristics of the target resource; 
(b) if no suitable entry is found in the cache server node 
directories, directing the locate request to one or more 

alternate cache server nodes in the network; 
(c) if no suitable reply is returned from the alternate cache 
server nodes, then broadcasting the locate request to all 

other nodes in the network to determine if any of said nodes 
include a record of the target resource.

a cache server node are organized into a plurality of domains, 

each of said domains being served directly by a single cache 
server node and including an additional step following step 

(a), said additional step comprising the step of broadcasting 
the locate request to all of the nodes in the cache server 

node's domain if no suitable entry is found in the resource 
 

directories maintained at the cache server node. 
A method as defined in either of claims 1 and 2 wherein the 
step of directing the locate request to one or more of the 

other cache server nodes further comprises the steps of:

categorized by their levels of capabilities in maintaining 

resource records; 
(b) if the alternate cache server nodes are so categorized,
