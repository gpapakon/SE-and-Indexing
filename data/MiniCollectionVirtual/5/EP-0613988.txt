Door hinge for a motor vehicle comprising two hinge halves (1; 2), in particular 
hinge arms, made of metal, pivotably connected to one another by means of a 

hinge pin (5), whereby the first hinge half (1) is formed by a moulded part 
moulded together with a hinge pin (5) in one piece and with standard shape and 

material, and whereby furthermore the total height of the hinge pin (5) is smaller 
than the total height of the hinge leaf (4) formed thereon, the axial length of the 

hinge pin (5) however is equal to or greater than the axial length of the hinge 
eye (6) of the second hinge half (2), characterised in that the hinge pin (5) 

connected to the hinge leaf (4) by means of a bearing part (3) of standard shape 
and material is encased rotation-fast by a sleeve (13) made of wear-resistant 

material and the second hinge half (2) is formed by a longitudinal section of a 
continuous hinge profile. 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
sleeve (13) made of wear-resistant material is connected in axial direction 

positively with the hinge eye (6) of the second hinge half (2) and can be coupled 
rotation-fast in peripheral direction with the hinge pin (5). 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the hinge pin (5) has a cross sectional shape other than a true circle and the 

sleeve (13) made of wear-resistant material has a complementary cross 
sectional sh
ape on its inside diameter. 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the hinge eye (6) of the second hinge half (2) is mounted by means of a 

bearing bush (18) made of maintenance-free bearing material on the sleeve (13) 
made of wear-resistant material enclosing the hinge pin (5). 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the hinge half (1) furnished with the hinge pin (5) is made of a steel 

material and is formed by a forged or extruded part.  
 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the securing of the hinge eye (6) of the second hinge half (2) on the hinge 

pin (5) is formed by a deformation, e.g. riveting or notching of the section of the 
hinge pin (5) projecting over the hinge eye (6). 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to claim 6, characterised in that an 
insertion disc (10) is arranged between the deformation of the free end of the 

hinge pin (5) and the end face of the hinge eye (6) of the second hinge half (2) 
facing the latter. 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the axial securing of the hinge eye (6) of the second hinge half (2) on the 

hinge pin (5) is formed by an insertion disc (10) connected to the hinge pin (5) 
by means of a bolt (12) engaging in a blind bore (11) in the hinge pin (5). 
Door hinge for a motor vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised 
in that a fixed part of the door check comprising the braking or detent markings 

of a door check connected to the hinge is also formed in one piece with the 
hinge half (1) comprising the hinge pin (5).
