<ABSTRACT>
Obesity is treated by the administration to a subject of a compound having the general formula (I): R4-(CH2)n-CO-N(R1)-CH(R2)-CO(-R3), wherein R1 represents H or CH3; R2 represents a side chain of a naturally occurring amino acid; R3 represents OH, OCH2CH3 and NH2; n is 6-18; and R4 represents CH3 or a group having the general formula (II): R3-CO-CH(R2)-N(R1)-CO-, wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the above meanings. The compounds of formula (I) wherein R4 is a group of formula (II), are novel compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of treatment and 
prevention of obesity. The present invention provides compositions containing as active 
ingredient, lypophilic derivatives of natural amino acids and their use in 
the treatment or prevention of such disorders. The following prior art is believed to be relevant as a 
background to the present invention: 
1. Bar-Tana et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1985, 260, 8404-8410. 2. Rose-Kahn et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1985, 260, 8411-8415. 3. Bar-Tana et al., J. Lipid Res., 1988, 29, 431-441. 4. Frenkel et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1988, 263, 8491-8497.  5. Tzur et al., Diabetes, 1988, 37, 1618-1624. 6. U.S. Patent No. 4,634,795. 7. U.S. Patent No. 4,689,344. 8. U.S. Patent No. 4,711,896.  9. U.S. Patent No. 4,908,385.   In the following text, reference to these prior art publications 
will be made by indicating in brackets their number from the above list. Energy from food is primarily provided by carbohydrates and 
lipids. Carbohydrates usually supply the immediate energy needs and their 
excess is stored as glycogen in the liver or converted to lipids. Lipids can 
also be metabolized as immediate energy providing substances but their rate 
of energy provision is relatively slow and they are generally stored in the 
body for use in states of deprivation. Lipid is stored in the body mostly as 
fat under the skin and consumption of lipids and carbohydrates beyond the 
metabolic need leads to fattening. The associated medical and aesthetic 
problems, are a major concern in modern society. Apart from surgery and dietary means for reduction of fat 
absorption in the small intestine, there are presently no satisfactory means 
for reducing fat storage in the body and the current means of choice are still 
diet and exercise. There is, however, a desire for drugs which will reduce 
fat accumulation by inhibiting lipid and lipoprotein synthesis in the liver. 
Recently, a series of β,β' tetramethyl substituted α,ω dicarboxylic acids 
(MEDICA) have been synthesized and suggested as potential anti-fattening 
drugs(1-4,6-9). The most potent drug of this series was found to be the 
hexadecane derivative (MEDICA 16). It was demonstrated that MEDICA, 
which is a non-naturally occurring fatty acid, could inhibit biosynthetic 
pathways of triglycerides and cholesterol in the liver. Experiments with 
MEDICA 16 given in the diet to normal and obese rats have indicated a 
strong inhibition of glyceride and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver 
evidenced by a marked reduction in their serum
