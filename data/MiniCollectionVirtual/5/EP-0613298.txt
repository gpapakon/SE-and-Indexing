<ABSTRACT>
An electronic video record and playback assembly (11) 
operates in a recording mode to store input material in a 

solid state memory unit (12), and operates in a playback 
mode to reproduce the prerecorded material in response to 

user playback requests. The assembly (11) includes direct 
memory access (DMA) devices which serve as the interface 

(14) to the memory unit (12), and a signal compressor (17) 
for reducing the input material for digital storage. The 

assembly (11) is capable of accommodating multiple 
playback requests via the DMA devices such that plural 

reproduction of shared material may be viewed 
simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video distribution 
systems and, more particularly, to an assembly for 
recording video programming material and reproducing the 
recorded material on multiple output channels in response 
to access requests. Conventional video record playback (VRP) devices refer 
generally to electro-mechanical, magnetic, and optical 
media assemblies and include, for example, video cassette 
recorders (VCR), video cassette players (VCP) with 
magnetic media, laser disk players (LDP), and 
write-once-read-many (WORM) optical media devices. Each of the above devices suffers from an inability to 
provide more than a single output. In WORM and LDP 
devices, there is a playback 'head' on each side of the 
platter, with the design emphasis focusing on providing 
non-interrupted or minimally interrupted video. In these 
devices, however, there is no means to share the media at 
random. Additionally, in VOD and NVOD experimental 
systems, a number of VCR or VCP devices are used with the 
same video material. In the VOD systems, the players are 
assigned to the subscribers on a first-come-first-serve 
basis, while in the NVOD systems a number of VCP or VCR 
devices are playing simultaneously, with each having been 
started at a fixed time interval (typically 15-30 minutes) 
apart from the others. As a further disadvantage of conventional VRP devices, 
video quality in all but very expensive professional 
reproduction equipment is at best mediocre. For example, 
the reproduced video quality in magnetic media type 
[90-3-888 EP]  
 
equipment deteriorates rapidly with use. In NVOD systems, 
the magnetic cartridges are changed at least once per 
week, and the VCR/VCP assemblies are always powered and in 
the PLAY mode in order to improve the response time during 
reproduction or playback phase. However, the heat 
developed in such continuously powered equipment 
accelerates the degradation of the quality of the video 
reproduced from the magnetic media. The aforementioned devices are also subject to 
reliability problems since, as they are electro-mechanical 
assemblies, the equipment is characterized by alignment 
problems. In particular, misaligned or slightly 
misaligned equipment can provide unacceptable or 
marginally acceptable video. Moreover, the video effects in the listed devices lack 
quality. For example, in PAUSE, SCAN, or FAST FORWARD 
modes of VCR and VCP devices, the noise is a well known 
artifact of the technology. Only the optical media 
devices provide quality freeze frame or
