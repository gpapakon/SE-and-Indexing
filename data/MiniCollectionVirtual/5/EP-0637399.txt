<ABSTRACT>
A generally rectangular outer housing (32) sized to fit within the full height five and one quarter inch form factor. A drawer (34) is mounted for sliding motion within the housing along a longitudinal axis thereof from a retracted position in which the drawer is substantially fully contained within the housing (32) to an extended position in which a forward portion of the drawer (34) extends beyond a forward transverse end of the housing (32). A data tape drive (35) is mounted within a rear portion of the drawer and has a forwardly opening cassette insertion slot. A cassette magazine (42) is provided that has a plurality of vertically spaced receptacles for holding a plurality of data cassettes in a vertically stacked configuration. A magazine loader (36) is mounted in the forward portion of the drawer for receiving and vertically reciprocating the cassette magazine (42) and for selectively transferring cassettes between the magazine (42) and the cassette insertion slot of the data tape drive (35).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to peripheral
memory storage devices for computer systems, and
more particularly, to tape drive systems in which a
plurality of cassettes normally stored within a
magazine may be selectively loaded into a tape
drive.With the advent of personal computer systems in
the early 1980's, a defacto industry standard was
established which requires that hard disk drives,
floppy disk drives and tape drives fit within a
rectangular space measuring approximately three and
one-quarter inches (8.3 centimeters) in height by
five and three-quarter inches (14.6 centimeters) in
width by eight inches (20.3 centimeters) in length.
This standard is hereafter referred to as the "full
height five and one-quarter inch form factor". An
example of a tape drive which fits within this form 
factor and utilizes the DC600 tape cartridge is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,573,091 of Barton, et
al. owned by Archive Corporation of Costa Mesa,
California, U.S.A.Recently digital audio tape (DAT) technology
has been utilized in very high storage capacity tape
drives for computer systems in accordance with the
so-called SONY/HEWLETT-PACKARD standard. See ANSI
X3B5/88-185A.One example is the PYTHON (Trademark)
tape drive commercially available from the ARDAT
subsidiary of Archive Corporation. The PYTHON tape
drive accepts the standard four millimeter DAT
cassette and is capable of storing five gigabytes of
data thereon. The PYTHON tape drive fits within a
smaller industry standard three and one-half inch
form factor.There are a number of applications where it
would be desirable to have a relatively low cost
peripheral memory storage device which could provide
well in excess of five gigabytes of data storage
capacity. For example, it would be desirable to be
able to download data from the disk server of a
large local area network. It would also be
desirable to provide backup storage for the data
stored on the disk in the event of a head crash,In European Published Patent Application EP-A-0,535,640 (published after
the priority date of the present application and relevant under Article 54(3) EPC
for novelty purposes only in respect of DE, FR, GB and IT) there is illustrated a
cassette loading system for selectively loading five four millimetres DAT cassettes
from a magazine into a three and one-half inch form factor DAT tape drive such as
the PYTHON tape drive. The tape drive is mounted within a receptacle in a
personal computer. However, the magazine loader extends beyond the front panel
of the personal computer.

<CLAIMS>
A combination tape drive and cassette
magazine loader (30), comprising:


a generally rectangular outer housing (32)
a drawer (34) mounted for sliding motion within the
housing along a longitudinal axis thereof from a retracted

position in which the drawer is substantially contained
within the housing to an extended position in which a

forward portion of the drawer extends beyond a forward
transverse end of the housing;
a tape drive (35) mounted within a rear portion of
the drawer and having a forwardly opening cassette

insertion slot;
a cassette magazine (42) having a plurality of
vertically spaced receptacles for holding a plurality of

cassettes (44) in a vertically stacked configuration; and
a magazine loader (36) mounted in the forward portion
of the drawer for receiving and vertically reciprocating

the cassette magazine and for selectively transferring 
cassettes between the magazine and the cassette insertion

slot of the tape drive.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
a latch mechanism (64) for holding the drawer in its retracted

position.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
loader control circuit means (76) connected to the magazine

loader for automatically causing the magazine loader to
sequentially load and unload the cassettes from the

magazine into the tape drive.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
loader control circuit means connected to the magazine

loader for transferring a preselected cassette between the
magazine and the tape drive upon receipt of a command

relayed from a computer through the tape drive.
The combination of Claim 1 wherein the magazine
loader includes first drive wheel means (126) for engaging and

vertically reciprocating the magazine and second drive
wheel means (174) for engaging and moving a cassette in a 

longitudinal direction between the magazine and the
tape drive.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
a pair of guide rails (61) connected to and extending

longitudinally along a pair of opposite sides of the
housing for engaging and supporting the drawer for

longitudinal sliding motion.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
manual access actuator means (88) for causing the magazine

loader to move the magazine to a predetermined location
prior to causing the drawer to move forwardly from its

retracted position.
The combination of Claim 1 and further comprising
manual magazine eject actuator means (86) for causing the

magazine loader to move the magazine to a fully raised
docking location, the eject actuator means including a

manual actuator mounted on the magazine loader which is
concealed within the outer housing when the drawer is in

its retracted position. 
The combination of Claim 1 wherein the magazine
loader includes a loader control circuit having a

microprocessor (94) and a memory (96) for storing an operation
program that enables the loader control circuit to sense a

plurality of failure modes and respond with a plurality of
predetermined corrective actions.
The combination of Claim 1 wherein the cassette
magazine has four receptacles and the maqazine loader has

a top panel with a cut-out region (58) through which the
magazine can travel so as to permit a sufficient vertical

range of travel of the magazine without the magazine
travelling beyond a form factor of the housing.
The combination of Claim 1, wherein the tape drive is a DAT tape drive.
The combination of Claim 1, wherein the housing has a five and one quarter
inch form factor
