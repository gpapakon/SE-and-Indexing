<ABSTRACT>
A  hydraulic drive and braking system for vehicles has at least one hydraulic machine (primary machine 71), preferably a pump, and at least another hydraulic machine (secondary machine 2), preferably an engine. Both hydraulic machines are linked to each other by corresponding hydraulic medium ducts. Besides the primary machine, a second hydraulic machine (accelerating machine 71') is non-rotatively coupled to the driving source (69). The accelerating machine (71') is rotatively coupled to the driving source (69). The accelerating machine (71') is in communication over I/O valves (14, 15) with an accumulator (4) and it (71') has an adjustable stroke.

A hydraulic machine comprising cylinder chambers (36) which are 
arranged in a star shape in a main cylinder body (31) and 


which combine in the centre of the main cylinder body (31) to 
provide a central chamber (37) 
through which a connecting rod shaft (35) which rotates relative 
to the main cylinder body (31) extends in eccentric relationship with the 

main cylinder body (31), and 
pistons (32) are guided longitudinally displaceably and in 
sealing contact in the cylinder chambers (36), with a variation in volume 

of the working chamber (29), which pistons are connected to the 
connecting rod shaft (35), 
 
   characterised in that the feed of the pressure medium is through 

the interior of the piston (32), the connecting rod (30) and/or the slide 
member (51) and the eccentric connecting rod shaft (35) of the hydraulic 

machine (1). 
A hydraulic machine according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the feed of the pressure medium is by way of control pockets (105, 106) 

which are each arranged over at most 180° of the outside periphery of the 
eccentric (35) and which can come into communication with the radially 

outward ends of the working chambers (29). 
A hydraulic machine according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the eccentricity of the connecting rod shaft (35) 

relative to the main cylinder body (31) is adjustable insofar as a 
control piston (107) is relatively displaceable in sealing contact 

relative to the connecting rod shaft (35) in a cavity (108) in the 
connecting rod shaft (35) transversely with respect to the axis of 

symmetry thereof and the working chambers (114, 114') on both sides of 
the control piston (107) can be acted upon by control medium.  

 
A hydraulic machine according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a control piston (207) is displaceable in sealing 

contact in a base housing (200) and the working chambers (208, 208') on 
both sides of the control piston (207) can be acted upon with control 

medium and the control piston (207) is operatively connected by way of a 
lever (206) to the connecting rod shaft (35) so that displacement of the 

control piston (207) produces adjustment of the eccentricity of the 
connecting rod shaft (35). 
A hydraulic machine according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the lever (206) is a two-armed angle lever and the control piston (207) 

is displaceable parallel to the axis of symmetry of the connecting rod 
shaft (35). 
A hydraulic machine according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that in the centre the connecting rod shaft (35) has a 

continuous cavity (202) which extends along its axis of symmetry and the 
control piston (207) is arranged outside the cross-sectional area of the 

cavity (202) and acts on two levers (206) which including their groove 
sliders (201) are arranged on both sides outside the cavity (202). 
A hydraulic machine according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the pistons (32) and piston or connecting rod (30) are of an 

integral construction characterised in that 

the pistons (32) run in liners which are mounted in the main 
cylinder body (31) pivotably about a pivot axis parallel to the axis of 

rotation of the hydraulic machine (1), and 
the liners are of an outside contour which is part-circular in 
the direction of viewing the axis of rotation of the hydraulic machine 

(1) and are mounted pivotably in a similar inside contour of the main 
cylinder body (31). 
A hydraulic machine having the features of the classifying 
portion of claim 1 wherein the pistons (32) and piston or connecting rod 

(30) are of an integral construction characterised in that the cylinder 
chambers (36) are arranged in the main cylinder body (31) approximately 

tangentially relative to the centre of the main cylinder body (31), in 
particular through an angle of 15° to 60° with respect to the purely 

radial direction. 
A hydraulic machine having the features of the classifying 
portion of claim 1 wherein the pistons (32) and piston or connecting rod 

(30) are of an integral construction characterised in that 

the connecting rod shaft (35) comprises two eccentric bushes 
(56, 57) which run one within the other, so that the connecting rod eyes 

(33) or the slide members (51) run on the outside of the outer bush (56) 
and the inside surface of the inner bush (57) is supported on a concentric 

peripheral surface, and 
the mutually equal angular position of the two eccentric bushes 
(56, 57) can be set by a setting element. 
A hydraulic machine according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that 


slide members (51) which are connected to the rear sides of the 
pistons (32) are guided in an outwardly open undercut annular groove (52)
