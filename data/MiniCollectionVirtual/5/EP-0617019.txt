<ABSTRACT>
Enantiomerically pure 3R,5S-(+)-sodium erythro-(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-methoxymethylpyrid -3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoate is prepared by first cyclising a corresponding racemic ester to give the racemic lactones and subsequently separating these chromatographically by means of a chiral stationary phase. Cleavage of the enantiomerically pure lactones by means of base gives the enantiomerically pure end products.
