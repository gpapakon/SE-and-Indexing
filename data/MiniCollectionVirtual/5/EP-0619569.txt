<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a cooking appliance or an 
electronic control for a cooking appliance and method of 

controlling the same. A remote control unit having a built-in 
temperature sensor, positional switch and low-battery detection 

circuit is in two-way intermittent wireless communication with 
the appliance control unit of the present invention. The 

appliance control unit includes a switch means for controlling 
the heating elements of the cooking appliance wherein the switch 

means for each heating element includes two power switches 
connected in series and coupled with a redundancy detection 

circuit for the detection of a failure of one of the two power 
switches. Two-way communication between the two control units of 

the present invention is constantly monitored to ensure proper 
operation of the cooking appliance and to provide a mechanism to 

report errors to the user or to shut down the cooking appliance, 
as appropriate, soon after an error is detected. Mechanisms are 

also provided whereby the wireless communication means of the 
control units may be diagnosed to ensure the control units are 

properly communicating with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control of a domestic
appliance and, in particular, to a remote control system for the
control of a cooking appliance.Traditionally, controls for the operation of a cooking
appliance such as controls for the heating elements of a cooktop
surface as found on an electric range have been located either on
the cooktop surface or on a surface which extends vertically from
the rear or front of the cooktop surface. Each of these
locations have caused problems for either the consumer or the
manufacturer.Selectors, such as buttons or knobs, located on the cooktop
surface are susceptible to the collection of dust, food particles
and grease thereon and are often subjected to intense heat from
the proximately located heating elements. Usually, such
cooktop-positioned controls are readily accessible and visible to
the operator, but, undesirably, may also be accessible to small
children. Furthermore, such controls detract from the space
available on the cooktop surface for the heating elements and
cause the area around the controls to be difficult to clean.Many manufacturers of electric ranges place the heating
element control selectors on a surface extending vertically from
the rear of the cooktop surface. This allows the cooktop surface
to be used solely for the heating elements and makes the
selectors much less accessible to children. Such selectors are
also susceptible to collecting dusts, grease and food particles,
but due to their vertical orientation, may be less affected than 
are cooktop surface positioned controls. However, these rear
controls pose additional hazards for the operator as the
individual may incur burns or the individual's clothing may be
scorched or set on fire when reaching over hot heating elements
or over spattering or steaming foods located on the cooktop in
order to adjust the controls. Furthermore, rear controls and
displays are difficult for some operators to see and the vertical
orientation imposes difficulty for some in interpreting the
displays or the position of selectors.Detached control panels for cooktop surfaces have been
developed in which the control panel is installed in a countertop
proximate the cooktop surface and communicates via wiring to the
cooktop surface. Although detached control panels are easy to
see and allow the cooktop surface to be used solely for the
heating elements, installation of the detached control panel
decreases available countertop surface, is limited by the length
of cable provided, and increases the

of an elapsed time period between the transmission of said intermittent output signal

(58) and the receipt of said intermittent reply signal (70) by said first wire-free
communication means (60) exceeding a first predetermined value;
means for measuring the total period of time between the receipt by said
