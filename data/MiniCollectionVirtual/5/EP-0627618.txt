<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a method and to a device for monitoring, for example, the change over time of the activity of an electrically conductive liquid solution on the walls of an installation in which it is circulating, with the aid of a device which includes a reference electrode (7), an anode (9) and a cathode (8); the value of the abandon potential (E) of the cathode is measured, a variable electrical signal is applied between the cathode (8) and the anode (9); next, a pair of dimensionless relative values are formed for the values of the abandon potential and of the current; and the activity of the solution is determined by analysing the change in the pair of dimensionless relative values. - Application to analysing the change in a mixture comprising oil water (formation water) and a fluid for the assisted recovery of a petroleum effluent.
