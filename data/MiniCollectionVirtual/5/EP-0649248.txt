<ABSTRACT>
A television set is equipped with a circuit (12) for modulating the horizontal speed of the spot as a function of the video content with the aid of an additional horizontal deflector coil (13), including a circuit for differentiating the video signal (17) followed by an amplifier equipped at its output with a current-generator power stage (20), the output of which is linked to a terminal of the additional horizontal deflector coil (13), and a voltage amplifier (21, 22), equipped at its output with a voltage-generator power stage (22), the input of which is linked to the output of the differentiation circuit (17), and the voltage output of which is linked to the other terminal of the additional horizontal deflector coil (13). Applications: television, for giving a sharper appearance to luminance transitions in an image.
