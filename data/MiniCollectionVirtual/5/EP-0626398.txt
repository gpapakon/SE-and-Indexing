<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polychloroprene 
latex and its composition. Heretofore, adhesives using polychloroprene as the 
base material were mainly of a solvent type. However, in 
recent years, solvent type adhesives have been disfavored 
in view of the problems due to the solvent, such as the 
toxicity, the danger of explosion or fire or the adverse 
effects to environment, and demand for non-solvent type 
adhesives has been increasing. A polychloroprene latex has a very high adhesive 
force like a solvent-type adhesive and does not require 
use of an organic solvent, and it is expected to be a 
substitute for a solvent type adhesive. However, the 
polychloroprene latex adhesive has been practically used 
only in a limited field, and it has been desired 1 ○ to 
further improve the adhesive strength and heat resistance 
and 2 ○ to prevent the color change. On the other hand, it has been known from Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 22047/1975 to  
 
polymerize chloroprene and an unsaturated carboxylic acid 
in the presence of a water-soluble polymer compound and 
use the polymer as an adhesive. Further, the same 
publication discloses that other monomers copolymerizable 
to chloroprene may be copolymerized as third components. 
However, such copolymerization is limited to such an 
extent that chloroprene in a small amount of about 10% at 
the maximum can be substituted by another copolymerizable 
monomer containing no free carboxylic group. The present inventors have found it possible to 
improve the adhesive properties, the heat resistance and 
the discoloration resistance over the conventional 
polychloroprene latex by emulsion-polymerizing prescribed 
amounts of chloroprene, 2,3-dichlorobutadiene and an 
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid in the presence 
of a water-soluble polymer compound having a colloid-stabilizing 
activity. Thus, the present invention provides a 
polychloroprene latex obtained by emulsion polymerization 
of 100 parts by weight of chloroprene, from 20 to 200 
parts by weight of 2,3-dichlorobutadiene and from 0.5 to 
20 parts by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated 
carboxylic acid in the presence of from 1 to 10 parts by 
weight of a water-soluble polymer having a colloid-stabilizing 
activity. Further, the present invention provides a 
polychloroprene latex composition containing up to 100  
 
parts by weight of an at least one tackifier resin per 
100 parts by weight of the solid content of such a 
polychloroprene latex. In the present invention, use
