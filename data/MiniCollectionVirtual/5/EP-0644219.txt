<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a purification process of an aliphatic polyester 
prepared in the presence of a catalyst from a hydroxycarboxylic acid or 

a cyclic ester of a hydroxycarboxylic acid, or a combination of an 
aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with an aliphatic polybasic acid, or a 

mixture of these compounds, comprising deactivating the catalyst while 
maintaining the alip
hatic polyester in a molten or dissolved state, or 
insolubilizing and separating the catalyst and successively removing 

low molecular compounds; and can provide aliphatic polyester which has a 
low content of unreacted monomers and low molecular weight compounds 

and is excellent in heat resistance and weatherability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a purification process of an aliphatic
polyester which is useful as a biodegradable polymer for substituting
medical materials and general purpose resins. More particularly, the
invention relates to a purification process of an aliphatic polyester in
order to obtain an aliphatic polyester which scarcely contains unreacted
monomers and low molecular weight volatile components.As an aliphatic polyester, polylactic acid can be prepared from a
cyclic dimer of lactic acid which is usually called lactide, and the
preparation process has been disclosed in U.S.Pat. 1,995,970, 2,362,511
and 2,683,136.A copolymer of lactic acid and other hydroxycarboxylic acids can be
usually prepared from lactide which is a cyclic dimer of lactic acid and
a cyclic ester intermediate of hydroxycarboxylic acid (usually
glycolide which is a dimer of glycolic acid). The preparation process
has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. 3,636,956 and 3,797,499. When the
polyester is prepared by direct dehydration polycondensation of lactic
acid or lactic acid and other hydroxycarboxylic acids, azeotropic
dehydration condensation of raw materials, that is, lactic acid or
lactic acid and other hydroxycarboxylic acids is carried out preferably
in the presence of an organic solvent and a catalyst. The azeotropically
distilled solvent is dehydrated and substantially anhydrous solvent is
returned to the reaction system. Such a process can provide high
molecular weight polylactic acid and a copolymer of lactic acid and 
other hydroxycarboxylic acids which have practical strength (EP
Publication 0572675).As to preparation processes of an aliphatic polyester from aliphatic
polyhydric alcohols and aliphatic polybasic acids, a process for
providing a high molecular weight aliphatic polyester having practical
strength has been disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications HE1
4-189822 and 4-189823.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication SHO 62-25121 has
disclosed a process for preparing a high molecular weight polyglycolide or
polylactide by addition of a phosphoric acid or phosphorus acid
compound in the course of the polycondensation. The addition decreases the
activity of a tin catalyst and inhibits the decomposition of the polymer
which takes place with the polycondensation reaction in the preparation
process of the polyglycolide or polylactide by direct polycondensation of
glycolic acid or lactic acid in the presence of the tin catalyst.
However, the weight average molecular weight of the polymer thus
obtained is a few
