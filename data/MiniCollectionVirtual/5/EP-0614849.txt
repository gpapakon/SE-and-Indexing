The invention relates to a filling-tube-less filling head or a filling head with a short filling tube for filling machines for filling bottles (2) or similar containers with a liquid. For treating the particular container (2) with a sterilisation medium, preferably with steam, there is provided a sterilisation tube (14) which can be moved from an upper stroke position into a lower stroke position, in which the sterilisation tube is arranged in such a manner in the container, with at least one opening formed in the region of the lower tube end (14'), that the container bottom (2''), which lies opposite a container opening (2'), is, in particular, also sufficiently subjected to the sterilisation medium emerging out of the opening into the container interior or removed from the container interior through the opening via the sterilisation tube.
