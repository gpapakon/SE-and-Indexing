<ABSTRACT>
A granular detergent composition or component having 
a bulk density of at least 650g/l is prepared by mixing a 

hydratable compound, e.g. anhydrous sodium carbonate, with 
a spray-dried powder, preferably in a high-speed mixer, and 

also adding water to the spray-dried powder, preferably in 
an agglomeration step carried out in a moderate-speed mixer 

downstream of the high-speed mixer. The agglomeration step 
may be carried out in the presence of a nonionic surfactant. 

After the agglomeration step, the resultant granular 
material may be aged in a fluidised bed apparatus. The 

product has improved dispensing and solubility properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a granular detergent composition or a component of 
a granular detergent composition, in particular such a 
composition or component having a high bulk density. Conventionally, granular detergent compositions have 
been manufactured by spray-drying processes. In such 
processes, one or more detergent components, such as 
surfactants and builders, are mixed with water and the 
resultant slurry is heated and spray-dried in a tower. Such 
processes are described, for example, by A. Davidsohn, 
"Spray Drying and Dry Neutralisation of Powdered 
Detergents", J. Am. Oil Chemists' Soc., Vol. 55, January 
1978, pp. 134-140. Although the spray-dried granules so 
obtained may exhibit a good solubility, the product tends to 
have a low bulk density, and hence the packing volume is 
large. There has been a recent trend in the detergents 
industry towards the manufacture of so-called concentrated 
or "compact" detergent powders, which typically have bulk 
densities of 600-650 g/l or higher. Although various 
processes for the production of detergent granules which do 
not require a spray-drying stage have been described in the 
literature, there is still a need for processes whereby 
products of high bulk density may be prepared by a spray-drying 
route. However, the scope for increasing the bulk 
density of the detergent product by adjusting the 
composition of the slurry fed to the spray-drying tower is 
limited and efforts have therefore been directed towards 
processes for the densification of spray-dried powders, i.e. 
the powders obtained from the spray-drying tower. One process for the post-tower densification of spray-dried 
powders is described in EP-A-0,367,339 (Unilever) and 
its equivalent US-A-5,133,924, which process comprises 
treating a spray-dried powder in a high-speed  
 
mixer/densifier, the mean residence time being from 5 to 30 
seconds, the so-treated material then being treated in a 
moderate-speed granulator/densifier with a mean residence 
time of from 1 to 10 minutes, whereby the material is 
brought into, or maintained in, a deformable state (the 
powder being considered to be in a deformable state if its 
compression modulus is less than 25 MPa). The material 
obtained from the moderate-speed granulator/densifier is 
then subjected to drying and/or cooling so that it is no 
longer in a deformable state and is ready for use, handling 
and storage. However, this process may give rise to a 
product that contains a substantial quantity
