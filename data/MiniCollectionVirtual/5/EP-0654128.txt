<ABSTRACT>
A cross axis actuator (1.1) for reducing the transmission of vibration along elongate members (1.2) comprising a series of windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) wound helically at 30  pitch around the member (1.2) along part of its length in clockwise and anti-clockwise fashion and are anchored at two or more points (1.3, 1.4) to the member (1.2), the windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) being able to be subjected to strain which causes deformation of the member (1.2) between attachment points (1.3, 1.4). The member (1.2) can be either a steel pipe or a rod. The windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) can either be in the form of steel wires or be strips of material. The numbers of windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) wound around the member (1.2) in a clockwise and anti-clockwise direction should be equal. Ideally, the windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) are attached to the member (2) on a continuous basis except for the ends which are left free. The strain is generated from actuators, preferably made from piezo electric materials, which can either be attached to the ends of the windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) or form part of the windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10). The actuators can be controlled by control signals which are calculated by a control unit based on signals produced by vibration sensors (1.13, 1.14). Ideally, part of the member (1.2) is formed to produce an impedance mismatch with the rest of the member (1.2). This can be achieved by having a flexible section (1.2a) within the member (1.2). The windings (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10) are usually attached across this section (1.2a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of vibration reduction and 
apparatus for the same based on the technique of cross axis actuation. Cross axis actuators are used for the active control of vibration in 
various pieces of apparatus, in particular elongate members, and operate 
to isolate vibration to a particular part of an apparatus by actively 
deforming an element along which undesirable vibrations are transmitted. Various approaches to the active control of vibration transmitted along 
elongate members are known. UK patent application, publication number 
2229789 discloses the use of a plurality of elongate and rigid actuators 
which are attached in parallel across a length of elongate member. The 
elongate member has flanges anchored to it at two points along its 
length and the actuators are then attached to the flanges. The 
actuators are movable via control signals originating from sensors so as 
to cause small deformation in the member between the points of flange 
attachment. This results in vibrational energy being reflected back 
towards its source. By attaching six actuators it is possible to 
control all possible low frequency vibrations which the member undergos, 
that is, longitudinal (compressional), transverse and torsional 
vibrational modes. In this case each flange has three attachment points 
for the actuators the attachment points on each flange being positioned 
at an angle of 120° to each other relative to the axis of the member. 
The relative attachment points on one flange to the other are offset by  
 
an angle of 60° with respect to the axis of the member. Each flange 
attachment point serves to attach two actuators these actuators being 
attached to the two closest attachment points on the other flange. This design is however rather complex and costly. It also occupies a 
significant volume within the region of the flanges and this may hamper 
fitment of the device and its maintenance. There is therefore a requirement for a simplified approach to the design 
of cross axis actuators occupies less space in the region of attachment. According to the present invention there is provided a cross axis 
actuator for reducing the transmission of vibration along elongate 
members and the like which comprises a series of windings wound around 
the member along at least part of the members length in clockwise and 
anti-clockwise fashion and are anchored at two or more points to the 
member, the windings being capable of being subjected to strain in order to cause 
deformation of
