<ABSTRACT>
An improved stainless steel composition and an improved stainless Ni-based alloy 
are disclosed for use in nuclear reactor environments. The improved stainless alloys include 

a stainless steel and a stainless nickel based alloy that are particularly well adapted for use in 
reactor components that are positioned adjacent to components formed from a zirconium 

based metal. The improved stainless steel is an austenitic stainless steel material that include 
less than approximately 0.2 percent manganese by weight, but does include sufficient 

austenitic stabilizer to prevent a martensitic transformation during fabrication or use in a 

reactor environment. In one preferred embodiment, the stainless alloy is formed without 
any significant amount of manganese.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improving the corrosion resistance of 
zirconium alloy based components in nuclear reactor environments. More particularly, 
improved stainless alloy compositions are disclosed that reduce the shadow corrosion effect 
occasionally observed in zirconium alloy components positioned adjacent to stainless 
components in nuclear reactors. Corrosion studies of components used in environments subjected to nuclear 
irradiation have shown enhanced corrosion in various zirconium alloy based components 
that are positioned adjacent to certain stainless steel, platinum, copper, hafnium and yttrium 
based components. This enhanced corrosion is manifested by a so-called "shadow effect" 
that takes the form of a region of enhanced corrosion in the zirconium component that 
occurs immediately adjacent to the shadowing component. In some cases, the enhanced 
corrosion can potentially limit the useful life of the zirconium alloy based component. The 
applicants have determined that there is considerable evidence that a constituent of the  
 
"shadowing" material becomes activated and that beta particles emitted by the activated 
shadowing component are the cause of this increased corrosion (i.e. shadow effect 
corrosion). This observation has been confirmed, for example, by Lemaignan in his article 
entitled "Impact of Î²- Radiolysis and Transient Products on Radiation-Enhanced Corrosion 
of Zirconium Alloys", Journal of Nuclear Material, Vol. 187 1992 p. 122-130. Two 
possible mechanisms by which beta particles can cause increased corrosion are the 
production of irradiation damage in the oxide present on the surface of the zirconium alloy 
component, and the production of local transient radiolytic species in the coolant water. In boiling water reactors, stainless steel is used in many core components. Thus, 
the applicants have observed shadow effect corrosion in several components. It is therefore 
an object of the present invention to eliminate or at least reduce the shadow effect caused in 
zirconium based components that are situated adjacent to stainless alloy components within 
a nuclear reactor. To achieve the foregoing and other objects and in accordance with the purpose of the 
present invention, an improved stainless alloy composition for use in nuclear reactor 
environments is disclosed. The improved stainless alloy is particularly well adapted for use 
in reactor components that are positioned adjacent to a zirconium based metal. In one 
embodiment, the improved
