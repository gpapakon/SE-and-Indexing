<ABSTRACT>
Device for the fuel supply of a motor vehicle engine - having a fuel filter (1) which has a fuel filter housing (6) made of plastic and a replaceable filter cartridge (7), having a fuel system with a fuel pump (11), a fuel tank (2) and fuel lines (3) for supplying fuel to the internal combustion engine of the motor vehicle, and having an air system with a combustion air filter (4) and combustion air lines (5) for feeding combustion air to the internal combustion engine of the motor vehicle. The fuel flows through the fuel filter housing (6) and the filter cartridge (7). With the fuel pump (11) switched on, the fuel filter housing (6) is subject to positive pressure. To allow any fuel that emerges in an uncontrolled manner to be collected, the fuel filter (1) is accommodated in a component that belongs to the fuel system and/or to the air system.

A device for the fuel supply of a motor vehicle engine, 
having 


a fuel filter (1) which comprises a fuel filter housing 
(6) made of synthetic material and at least one filter 

cartridge (7) replaceably disposed therein and an 
external cover (8) which is removable in order to replace 

the filter cartridge (7), 
a fuel system with a fuel pump (11), a fuel tank (2) and 
fuel lines (3) for the supply of fuel to the internal 

combustion engine of the motor vehicle, and 
an air system with a combustion air filter (4) and 
combustion air lines (5) for the supply of combustion air 

to the internal combustion engine of the motor vehicle, 
 
wherein the fuel flows through the fuel filter housing (6) and 

through the filter cartridge (7), and the fuel filter housing 
(6) is under an overpressure when the fuel pump (11) is 

switched on, and wherein the fuel filter (1) is accommodated 
in a component forming part of the fuel system or of the air 

system for the purpose of capturing fuel emerging in an 
uncontrolled manner, characterised in that the combination of  

 
the following features is put into effect: 


a) a spacer gap (9) which comprises a leak protection means 
is situated between the cover (8) and the fuel filter housing 

(6), 
b) the leak protection means is put into effect in that the 
spacer gap (9) communicates, protecting from leaks, with the 

fuel system or with the air system. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
cover (8) of the fuel filter housing (6) is designed as an 

insertion cover having a cover skirt (12) and a cover flange 
(13), which cover flange (13) is placed on a supporting 

shoulder (14) on the fuel filter housing (6), wherein the 
spacer gap (9) is formed between the cover skirt (12) and the 

opposing fuel filter housing (6) and between the cover flange 
(13) and the supporting shoulder (14), and wherein the said 

spacer gap (9) is connected to the fuel system or to the air 
system via at least one bore (10). 
A device according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the cover (8) is held on the fuel filter 

housing (6) by a union ring nut (15). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a sealing ring (16), which is inserted 

in a sealing ring seating (17) on the cover (8), is 
additionally disposed in the spacer gap (9).  

 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the fuel filter (1) is disposed in the 

fuel tank (2) of the fuel system with an external cover (8), 
and the spacer gap (9) communicates, protecting from leaks, 

with the interior space of the fuel tank (2). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the fuel filter (1) is disposed in the 

activated carbon filter (18) of a tank ventilation means (19) 
forming part of the air system, with an external cover (8), 

and the spacer gap (9) communicates, protecting from leaks, 
with a collecting space (20) for the fuel vapours, from which 

collecting space (20) an intake line (21) leading to the motor 
vehicle engine leads off. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the fuel filter (1) is disposed in the 

combustion air filter (4) of the air system with an external 
cover (8), and the spacer gap (9) communicates, protecting 

from leaks, with a collecting space (22) which is behind the 
filter body (23) of the combustion air filter (4) in the 

direction of flow of the combustion air. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the fuel filter (1) is designed as a 

modular component and comprises a fuel filter housing (6) 
which is injection-moulded from synthetic thermoplastic  

 
material and has a moulded-on installation component (24), and 

comprises a cover (8) which is injection-moulded from 
synthetic thermoplastic material. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the combination of the following 

features is put into effect: 

a) the fuel filter (1) has a fuel filter housing (6) of 
synthetic material with a reduced barrier effect and/or 

reduced protection from leaks, 
b) the fuel filter only satisfies the leak protection 
requirements due to its installation in the component forming 

part of the fuel system and/or air system.
