<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to heaters 
for electron emitters, i.e., cathodes, of vacuum tubes 
and more particularly to such a heater formed of 
anisotropic pyrolytic graphite in which current passes 
through the graphite in the "c" direction. Cathode heaters of modern vacuum electron tubes 
generally include a length of wire formed of a refractory 
metal, such as tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium or a 
refractory alloy, such as tungsten-rhenium. The wire is 
usually bent into a convenient shape, such as a flat 
spiral or a zig-zag configuration, or a cylinder or 
toroid. For proper operation, the heater wire is 
electrically insulated from the cathode which it heats, 
as well as from any supporting structure of the heater 
itself. Electric insulation between the heater and the 
remaining components is typically provided by maintaining 
an adequate distance between the heater and the remaining 
structure, as in the case of a free-standing heater. 
Alternatively, the heater wire is coated with an 
insulating layer, such as. alumina, as in the case of a 
cataphoretically coated heater. In still another 
arrangement, the heater is electrically insulated from 
the surrounding structure by placing a separate 
insulation component between the heater and the 
surrounding structure, as in the case of a captured  
 
heater. A further structure for electrically insulating 
the heater from the surrounding structure involves 
embedding the heater wire in an insulating potting 
material, as in the case of a potted heater. 
Combinations of the above structures are widely used. In 
summary, the typical modern prior art heater for an 
indirectly heated cathode of a vacuum electron tube is 
basically an insulated, bent wire made of refractory, 
electrically conducting material that is electrically 
insulated from structures in proximity to it. For most modern indirectly heated cathode 
applications, the bent electrically conducting, 
refractory heater is suitable. A disadvantage, in 
certain situations, with the typical modern heater is 
that it requires a substantial length of time, such as 
one minute, to achieve the temperature required for 
emission of electrons from the cathode. There are 
certain applications wherein the cathode must achieve 
emission in a matter of seconds or which require a 
greater efficiency in transferring heat to the cathode. 
In addition, there are certain applications in which the 
entire vacuum tube, including the heater, must be able to 
survive severe shock and vibration
