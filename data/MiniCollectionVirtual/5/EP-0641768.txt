<ABSTRACT>
Constitution: a nitroxyalkylamide derivative represented by the general formula (I): R¹-(A)n-COHN-B-ONO₂, 
wherein 

R¹ represents optionally substituted heterocyclic, heterocyclic oxy, aryloxy or arylthio; A represents C₁-C₄ 
alkylene; B represents 

C₁-C₄ alkylene; and n represents 0 or 1. Effect: this compound is excellent in collateral vasodilatory and antianginal 
activities and hence is useful as a remedy for angina pectoris.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nitroxyalkylamide 
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts 
thereof having excellent vasodilator activity for the 
collateral vessels and anti-anginal action. At present, nitroglycerin is most frequently used 
clinically as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular 
diseases, particularly for angina pectoris. This agent, however, has some faults such as being 
susceptible to undergoing the first-pass effect and 
having a short duration of action. Furthermore, side 
effects occur, such as headache and dizziness and 
tachycardia caused by hypotension. Against this 
background, therapeutic agents for angina pectoris which 
undergo no first-pass effect and have fewer side effects 
during clinical treatment have been desired. Nitroxyalkylamide derivatives having anti-anginal 
action have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 
No. 4200640 and Japan Kokai Hei 2-134316. However, in 
the latter Kokai, there is no specific description. 
EP-A-300 400 discloses thiazole and oxazole derivatives 
having a nitroxyalkylamide ring substituent which are 
said to be useful in the treatment of vascular 
disorders. JP-A-57167981 discloses chromanyl 
derivatives having a nitroxyalkylamide ring substituent 
which are said to have activity as antihypertensives. The present inventors have eagerly studied for many 
years the synthesis of nitroxy compounds and the 
pharmacological actions thereof.  
 As a result, they have found that compounds having a 
nitroxyalkylamide group have excellent vasodilator 
action on the collateral vessels, have fewer side 
effects and are useful as therapeutic agents for angina 
pectoris; they thus completed the present invention. The present invention relates to nitroxyalkylamide 
derivatives having the general formula:
