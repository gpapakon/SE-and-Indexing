<ABSTRACT>
In a device for detecting positions of movable elements with sensors (1a; 1b), in particular for devices in pneumatics (cylinder housing 13), hydraulics or mechanics, the respective sensor (1a; 1b) is connected to an electronic control system (2) by a signal line (3) and a plug (4). In order to simplify the laying of the sensor connection lines for reducing assembly time and costs, it is proposed that two sensors (1a, 1b) to be connected, with their respective signal line (3a) and current lines (6), starting from the respective plug (4) and in each case running in any direction, be connected to a T-shaped contact carrier (5) in such a way that the lines can be adjusted automatically to different distances between the sensors (1a, 1b).

A means for detecting positions of moved elements
by means of sensors (1a, 1b), in particular for

pneumatic, hydraulic or mechanical apparatus, in which
the sensors (1a, 1b) are connected to an electronic

control means by a signal line (3a) and a plug (4),
characterised in that two sensors (1a, 1b) which are to

be connected are connected to a T-shaped contact holder
(5) with their respective signal line (3a) and power

supply lines (6) starting from the respective plug (4)
in each case extending in any directions desired, such

that the lines can automatically be set to different
distances between the sensors (1a, 1b).
A means according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the signal lines (3) and the power supply lines

(6) extend between the contact holder (5) and the
sensors (1a; 1b) within an elastic coiled cable (7).
A means according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the T-shaped contact holder (5)

can be placed on and fastened to a tension rod (8).
A means according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that a first sensor (1a) is arranged

on the coiled cable (7) and a second sensor (1b) is
connected directly to the contact holder (5).
