<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for 
hydrocarbon processing. In another aspect, this 
invention relates to processes for the removal of 
contaminants from hydrocarbons. In still another 
aspect, this invention relates to processes for the 
removal of butadiene derivative contaminants from a 
cracked hydrocarbon stream. Cracking is a well known process involving 
decomposition and molecular recombination of organic 
compounds, especially hydrocarbons obtained by means of 
heat to form molecules suitable for motor fuels, 
monomers, petrochemicals, etc. A series of 
condensation reactions takes place accompanied by 
transfer of hydrogen atoms between molecules which 
brings about fundamental changes in their structure. 
Methods of hydrocarbon cracking include thermal 
cracking, which utilizes heat to carry out the 
cracking, and catalytic cracking, which utilizes a 
catalyst generally either with the moving-bed or fluid-bed 
technique. Steam cracking is widely used for the production 
of light olefins from saturated hydrocarbons. Reaction  
 
conditions for steam cracking of saturated hydrocarbons 
are selected to maximize the production of light 
olefins. Typically, cracking is practiced at a weight 
ratio of 0.3:1.0 of steam to hydrocarbon with the 
reactor coil outlet at 760-870°C, and slightly above 
100 kPa (atmospheric) pressure. The type of feedstocks and the reaction conditions 
determine the mix of hydrocarbon products produced. 
Many steam crackers operate on light paraffin feeds 
consisting of ethane and propane and the like. 
However, a significant amount of steam cracking 
capacity operates on feedstocks which contain propane 
and heavier compounds. Steam cracking such feedstocks 
produces a hydrocarbon mixture composed of many 
marketable products, notably propylene, isobutylene, 
butadiene, amylene and pyrolytic gasoline. Generally, in steam cracking, the cracked gases 
emerging from the reactors are rapidly quenched to 
arrest undesirable secondary reactions which destroy 
light olefins. Unfortunately, in addition to the 
foregoing desirable components, undesirable acetylenic 
compounds, are many times also produced. These 
acetylenic compounds generally are required to be 
removed at least to the level of a few parts per 
million in order for the stream to meet process 
requirements, for example, in polymerization processes 
or to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides in 
equipment. Typically these acetylenic compounds are 
alpha-acetylenes corresponding to olefins and
