ethylenevinylalcohol copolymer (EVOH), to an average 
particle size smaller than 5 mm; 
ii)
 

drying the reduced plastic; 
iii)
 

extruding and degassing the dried, reduced plastic; and 
iv)
 

moulding to the base material with a wall thickness 
smaller than 15 mm; 
 
and to the manufactured base material having as composition: 


a) 

i)
 

0.1-10% by weight of ethylenevinylalcohol copolymer 
(EVOH); 
ii)
 

0-10% by weight of thermoplastic polyester; 
iii)
 

0-30% by weight of polyethylene; and 
iv)
 

0-5% by weight of metal particles with an average 
particle size smaller than 5 mm; and 
b) a wall thickness smaller than 15 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a base material from recycled plastic, in 
particular a plastic based on polystyrene or polypropylene 
which, to obtain a low gas permeability, contains a layer of 
a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl alcohol, and is therefore 
applied as foil in the packaging industry. The present 
invention further relates to a manufactured base material 
from such a recycled plastic, which base material is of great 
practical value because the dimensions of the base material 
lie within narrow tolerances, for example within a tolerance 
of Â± 0.5 mm, in particular 0.2 mm for the wall thickness. When using foils based on polystyrene or polypropylene 
which contain a gas-tight layer of ethylenevinylalcohol 
copolymer (EVOH), a relatively large amount of waste, for 
example up to 20-40% of the starting material, remains after 
punching out the desired part of the packaging material. This 
waste can no longer be used in the packaging industry, and 
yet this foil provided with punch holes is per se no longer 
usable. The present invention has for its object to find a new 
application for the above described recycled plastic in the 
form of a base material. This is achieved according to the invention in that a 
method is provided for manufacturing from recycled plastic a 
base material based on polystyrene or polypropylene, 
comprising of: 
i)
 
reducing recycled plastic based on polystyrene or 
polypropylene, which contains 0.1-10 % by weight of 
ethylenevinylalcohol copolymer (EVOH), to an average 
particle size smaller than 5 mm; ii)
 
drying the reduced plastic;  iii)
 
extruding and degassing the dried, reduced plastic; and iv)
 
moulding to the base material with a wall thickness 
smaller than 15 mm. Research has shown that if the foil-like plastic waste 
is reduced by grinding or extrusion to a size of the 
particles or granules smaller than 5 mm, preferably smaller 
than 4 mm, a good homogeneity is obtained for the first time 
when the reduced plastic material is thereafter melted in an 
extruder. However, reduction to below a maximum average 
particle size is not sufficient to obtain a base material of 
the above described requirements. It has been found namely 
that through the use of an EVOH layer in the plastic foil 
moisture accumulates at the level of the EVOH layer and that 
this moisture has to be removed prior to extrusion. The 
drying can only be omitted if the plastic foil which still 
has to be processed in the packaging material has already 
been
