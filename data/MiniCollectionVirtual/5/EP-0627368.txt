<ABSTRACT>
A method of unloading a cargo (90) from a lined, modular cargo 
container (50) having a flexible, expandable liner (10) located inside 

the container (50) and expanded against the interior surfaces 
thereof. The method comprises the steps of conducting gas 

into the interior of the liner (10) to increase the pressure on 
the bulk cargo (90) therein and to urge the liner (10) outward against 

the interior surfaces of the cargo container (50); and drawing 
gas and substantially the complete supply of the bulk cargo (90) 

outward from the interior of the liner (10), without tilting the 
container (50) and without tilting the liner (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to liners 
for cargo containers, and to a method of installing a liner 
inside a cargo container. Standardized containers or boxes have come into 
very extensive use for the shipment of freight by land and 
sea, and the many advantages of such containers have made it 
extremely desirable to adapt them for use with as many types 
of cargo as possible. Accordingly, there have been attempts, 
with varying degrees of success, to use conventional 
containers to carry bulk cargo such as dry bulk chemicals, 
powdered and pelletized resins, flour, coffee and grains. When cargo containers are used to carry such bulk 
cargo, it is important that the container itself either be 
kept clean or be cleaned after each load of cargo is emptied 
from the container, so that the container can be subsequently 
used with another load of cargo. Moreover, it is important 
to protect the bulk cargo from contamination and from 
undesirable exposure to the natural elements. For these reasons, large plastic removable liners 
are often used to line the interior walls or surfaces of the 
cargo containers that are used to carry bulk cargo. The 
liner protects the cargo during shipment, for example, from 
rain and debris; and after the cargo is delivered, the liner 
can be removed so that the container is again usable, without 
significant cleaning, to carry other cargo. Various difficulties have been encountered, 
however, in using plastic liners in the above-described  
 
manner; and in particular, it has been found that the liners 
often tear or rupture under certain conditions. For example, 
a cargo container carrying bulk cargo is often emptied by 
opening the rear doors of the container, and raising the 
front end of the container to tilt the container so that the 
cargo slides out the back of the container. Prior art 
container liners often tear or rupture as the cargo slides 
rearward through the container and over the liner. Numerous 
attempts have been made to solve this problem by using braced 
cardboard or wood bulkheads to help support the liner inside 
the container, or by hanging the liner from the container 
roof or walls by means of a multitude of hooks connected to 
the top perimeter of the liner. These prior art attempts 
have not been completely successful; and it is believed that 
this is due, at least in part, to the fact that the exact 
specific factors causing liners to rip or tear have not been 
completely understood. An object of the present invention is to improve 
the

A method of unloading a cargo from a lined, 
modular cargo container, for use with a container having a 

flexible, expandable liner located inside the container and 
expanded against the interior surfaces thereof, wherein the 

liner includes a generally vertical panel defining inlet and 
outlet ports, and the cargo consists of a given supply of a 

bulk cargo, the method comprising: 
   conducting gas through the inlet port and into the 

interior of the liner to increase the pressure on the bulk 
cargo therein; and 

   drawing gas and substantially the complete supply 
of the bulk cargo outward from the interior of the liner, 

through the outlet port, without tilting the container and 
without tilting the liner. 
A method according to Claim 1 , wherein the 
conducting step includes the step of, during least most of 

the drawing step, conducting the volume of gas into the 
interior of the liner at a rate generally equal to the rate 

at which the volume of gas and cargo is drawn from the liner. 
A method according to Claim 2 , for use with a 
high pressure gas source, and a pump for drawing gas from the 

liner, and wherein: 
   the step of conducting gas into the interior of the 

oner includes the steps of 

i) connecting a gas supply hose having a given 
diameter to the high pressure source and to the liner inlet, 

and 
ii) conducting gas to the liner inlet from said 
high pressure source through said supply hose; and 
 
   the step of drawing gas and cargo from the liner 

includes the steps of 

i) connecting a discharge hose also having the 
given diameter to the liner outlet and to the pump, and 
ii) drawing gas and the bulk cargo from the liner 
through the discharge hose. 
A method according to Claim 3, further 
including the step of, during at least most of the drawing 

step, maintaining the pressure on the cargo inside the liner 
slightly above ambiant atmospheric pressure outside the 

container. 
A method according to Claim 4, wherein: 
   the conducting step includes the step of 

fluidizing the bulk cargo inside the liner; and 
   the drawing step includes the step of drawing the 

fluidized bulk cargo from the liner. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the 
container includes a floor defining a floor plane, and the 

liner includes a bottom panel positioned on the container 
floor, and further including the steps of, during the entire 

drawing step, 
   maintaining said floor plane substantially 

horizontal, and 
   maintaining the bottom panel of the liner in a 

generally flat position on the container floor.
