<ABSTRACT>
In an electrical wiring system, a typical process for suppressing noise due 
to electric current consists in preparing a pair of flat circuit units (11, 12, 40, 41) 

comprising respectively an insulation layer and at least one circuit conductor (13, 
14, 15, 16, 42, 43) therein or thereon which undulate to form wave-like patterns 

and in superposing fixedly said conductor of the first unit (11, 40) with that of the 
second unit (12, 41) in such that at least one insulation layer is interposed between 

the superposed conductors and whereby peaks (30) of the second unit conductor 
(15, 16, 43) face troughs (32) of the first unit conductor (13, 14, 42); according to 

the invention, fixing is performed by means enabling to interweave said peaks with 
said troughs. One such means consists in providing the first flat circuit unit with 

trough-side slits (33) and the second with peak-side slits (31) and in inserting the 
tongues (34) formed by the trough-side slits in the peak-side slits. Another such 

means consists in forming a pair of flat circuit units (40, 41) and corresponding 
circuit conductors (42, 43) into an undulation and in interweaving the pair in 

alternate upside and downside fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for fixing a pair of flat circuit units 
such as flat cables, which are 
used for wiring inside a car or an electronic appliance or the like, as well as a pair of 
connected flat circuit units used for this purpose. In case of wiring inside a car or an electronic appliance and the like, the 
wiring includes not only signal wires used for the digital signals which operate 
internal logic circuits or for the input/output signals which interface with outside 
appliances or the like, but also electrical source wires or ground wires which 
provide power for the electronic appliance with electric power. For this reason, 
magnetic fluxes are generated by a large amount of electric current passing through 
the electric source wire, thus producing noise on the digital signals, etc. Various 
measures have been taken to prevent such noise. As an example, JP-A-H5 120 928 (1993) discloses a system of structures 
adopted as a measure when the flat circuit units are used for the wiring inside a car. 
According to this system, as is shown in Fig. 6, a pair of flat circuit units 5, 6, each 
presenting flat conductors 3, 4 are superposed fixedly. The flat conductors 3, 4 
undulate to form wave-like patterns on insulation respective films 1, 2. In this 
way, when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the planes of the flat circuit 
units 5, 6, areas bounded by respective upper or lower flat conductors 3, 4 are 
formed between pairs of points where the two flat conductors 3, 4 intersect. This 
configuration makes it possible to suppress the formation of noise. The upper and lower elements that constitute the aforementioned flat 
circuit units 5, 6 provided with the undulating flat conductors 3, 4 are disclosed as 
being fixed in superposition by means of adhesives 7, or by heat deposit adhesion 
without using the latter adhesives or again by a fold-back method. However, with these fixing means, a dislocation tends to appear during 
fixing between the respective positions of the conductors 3, 4 undulating to form 
wave-like patterns. This phenomenon is a disadvantage in that it interferes with 
reliable production. In view of these problems, an object of the present invention is to prevent 
the formation of dislocations between the respective positions of the flat circuit 
units and to provide means for fixing the flat circuit units which can be 
implemented in a stable manner. Another object of the invention is to provide flat 
circuit units in which such means are
