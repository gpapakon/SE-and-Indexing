<ABSTRACT>
The transponder system according to the present invention presents a light weight portable or mobile system for localization of movable objects, e.g., for surveillance of valuable transports and the like. The small unit constituting the transponder contains a receiver (1) of paging type, a decoder (2), a logic unit (3), a transmitter portion (10), a built-in antenna and power supply (11). Additionally the system is further controllable by means of an existing tested radio system for paging. The advantages of utilizing an already existing paging system owes for one part to the fact that functionality is well tested at the same time as a general covering range is obtained and further that costs for building up and operation of this are eliminated. Control information being sent to the transponder is comprising first a number of symbols defining a certain basic function for the built-in marker transmitter (10) while the remaining symbols further are constituting control code and control data for this specific function, consequently at least the frequency, transmit power and transmitting sequences of the marker transmitter are controllable.

<DESCRIPTION>
TRANSPONDER SYSTEM. Technical fieldThe present invention relates to a portable/mobile transponder for the localizing of movable objects and more exactly the trans¬ ponder according to the present invention is possible to be enabled via an existing radio network, e.g. type MiniCall and/or BS-RDS.Prior artToday a frequent problem consists in thefts whereby there is no simple way to easily locate these objects. In certain cases, e.g., in the transportation of valuables, cassettes are used which contain a system such that if the cassette is unauthorized- ly opened a device is triggered for example staining the banknotes. These systems are however not suitable for larger transports of valuables, nor are they suitable for other indi¬ vidual objects of value.Therefore in the surveillance of objects which are easily being moved there exists a general demand for a marker transmitter, which for example, is possible to enable if the object to be guarded is brought out of a surveillance area. Such a marker or transponder then must be of small size, self supporting and capable of being applied to or inside the objects which are of interest to track.By means of such a marker device or transponder, for example, bags containing registered mail or money (currently existing in transportation of valuables) and additionally children or elderly people would be possible to track. The system would be very economical if portions of the system could be built on the utilization of partly prior technique and the system in principle having nation-wide coverage and this then further being combined with an intelligent transponder.In US-A-4908629 is disclosed a microprocessor based transponder 

for main use in vehicles being activated rom the national police headquarters with specifications from the FBI National Crime Information Center register by microwave link to VHF transmit¬ ters. Two-way communication on the same frequency with enabling and response. After enabling the transponder transmits ID every tenth second. The transponder may be localized by means of direction-finding equipment in a police car. A limited amount of control information may be transferred to the transponder which however is not applicable for portable use. The drive voltage +12 volts is taken from the supply of the vehicle. In connection with the patent from 1990 it may be noted that the claimed direction-finding equipment was previously published in "73 Magazine" July 1986 by permission of Electronics Australia, February 1986.Another document, UK Patent

CLAIMS
1. A transponder system (B) for localization of an object being provided with a transponder for this system comprising antenna device and a paging receiver (1) having an unique call, normally in form of a phone number accessible via an existing radio paging network for example of type MiniCall and/or MBS-RDS, character¬ ized in further comprising a built-in marker transmitter (10) working on a frequency different from the frequency of the paging receiver (1), a unit (2) for decoding of an authorization code and a control information obtained via the paging receiver (1), an electronic logic unit (3) preferably in form of a micropro¬ cessor for processing of control information obtained from the decoder (2), a power supply (11) to permit the transponder system (B) and its marker transmitter (10) to operate during a certain minimum time period also after the enabling of its marker transmitter, and that the operation mode of the marker transmitter (10) is controlled by the logic unit (3) based on control information obtained from the paging receiver (1) via the unit (2) for decoding.
2. The transponder system according to claim 1, characterized in that the logic unit (3) looks for the authorization code in the data information obtained by the decoder unit (2) which information is transferred by the use of the calling telephone's dialing buttons and received by the paging receiver (1) in question, that when the logic unit (3) finds an authorization code being valid for the paging receiver (1) in question having the unique call it will further process data information sent over the telephone network and received by the paging receiver (1) over the radio paging network.
3. The transponder system according to claim 2, characterized 


in that the additionally obtained data information constitutes control information for the marker transmitter (10), which information primarily via the electronic logic unit (3) enables or disables the marker transmitter (10).
4. The transponder system according to claim 3, characterized in that said control information further is comprising for one part a number of symbols which is defining a certain basic function of said marker transmitter (10), while the remaining decoded symbols constitute additional control information for this specific function in form of control data, at least the frequency, transmit power and transmitting sequence of the enabled marker transmitter accordingly being controllable.
5. The transponder system according to claim 4, characterized in that when said transponder (B) is receiving a call having a correct authorization code but no other data information said marker transmitter (10) always being enabled by said logic unit (3) through predetermined settings.
6. The transponder system according to claim 5, characterized by further comprising an additional receiver (9) for the GPS system which receiver is being enabled parallelly to said marker transmitter (10), in that received positioning information from said GPS receiver (9) is modulating said marker transmitter (10) for retransmission of the current position of said transponder (B).
7. The transponder system according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said marker transmitter (10) is operating in the range preferably around 1000 MHz, that said marker transmitter (10) additionally comprises a fixed frequency within the mobile radiotelephone band, for example 930 - 960 MHz, said marker transmitter (10) when enabled in such a mode alternatingly transmitting a defined identifica¬ tion on the fixed frequency in the mobile radiotelephone band and alternatingly is transmitting on its ordinary defined different 


frequency for direction finding purposes, whereby a further rough information is obtained about the location where close position¬ ing finding should take place due to the recognition of the network cell of the mobile radiotelephone system where said transponder (B) is localized.
8. The transponder system according to claim 7, characterized in that said transponder (B) identifies itself to the mobile radiotelephone system by utilizing its unique call, preferably in form of its phone number, whereby an enabled transponder (B) is simply identified by an existing mobile radiotelephone network.
9. The transponder system according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that said marker transmitter (10) is additionally comprising a transmitting frequency preferably in the range 30 - 50 MHz and transmitted via its ordinary antenna or an extra connected antenna to further facilitate direction finding within areas having strong reflections in the UHF range where the ordinary marker frequency is transmitted.
