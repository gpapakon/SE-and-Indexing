<ABSTRACT>
An NMR scanner performs a prescan before each NMR scan sequence in which the optimal RF excitation frequency is automatically determined and applied to the scanner's transceiver. The prescan sequence includes a pair of NMR measurements which provide data that allows the precise RF excitation frequency to be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance (NMR)
techniques. More specifically, this invention relates to the
automatic adjustment of the RF transmitter and receiver to
the optimal Larmor frequency.The magnetic resonance phenomenon has been utilized in
the past in high resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy
to analyze the structure of chemical compositions. More
recently, NMR has been developed as a medical diagnostic
modality having applications in imaging the anatomy, as well
as in performing in vivo, noninvasive spectroscopic analysis.
As is now well known, the NMR phenomenon can be excited
within a sample object, such as a human patient, positioned
in a homogeneous polarizing magnetic field, B0, by
irradiating the object with radio frequency (RF) energy at
the Larmor frequency. In medical diagnostic applications,
this is typically accomplished by positioning the patient to
be examined in the field of an RF coil having a cylindrical
geometry, and energizing the RF coil with an RF power
amplifier. Upon cessation of the RF excitation, the same or
a different RF coil is used to detect the NMR signals,
frequently in the form of spin echoes, emanating from the
patient lying within the field of the RF coil. In the course
of a complete NMR scan, a plurality of NMR signals are 
typically observed. The NMR signals are used to derive NMR
imaging or spectroscopic information about the patient being
imaged or studied.Before the commencement of each NMR scan, it is common
practice to adjust the frequency of the RF transmitter and
receiver to insure that the excitation field is at the
optimal Larmor frequency. This is necessary to produce the
desired image contrast effects in certain NMR measurements
and to insure the accuracy of slice selection location. In a
human subject, for example, the NMR signal is produced
primarily by the protons in water and fat molecules. The
Larmor frequency of the protons in these two substances is
slightly different and the Larmor frequency of both will vary
slightly from patient to patient and at different locations
within a patient due to inhomogeneities. In prior NMR
scanners, it is common practice to perform a calibration
sequence in which an NMR sequence is first executed and the
NMR signal is processed to produce on a CRT screen a picture
of signal amplitude versus RF frequency. The operator then
examines this picture and manually adjusts the frequency of
the RF receiver to desired value. For example, the displayed
NMR signal may show two peaks, one at the Larmor

<CLAIMS>
A method of automatically adjusting the RF frequency of a transceiver in an
NMR system, which comprises:


(a) performing an NMR measurement in which an NMR signal is produced
and acquired,
(b) transforming the acquired NMR signal to the frequency domain thus
gaining an NMR signal spectrum comprising a left end and a right end,
(c) defining a spectral density function depicting a lefthand and a righthand
peak corresponding to expected fat and water peaks,
(d) positioning the spectral density function with the lefthand peak at the left
end of the NMR signal spectrum,
(e) calculating the integral of the product of the spectral density function with
the NMR signal spectrum,
(f) shifting the spectral density function by a positive frequency increment
relative to the NMR signal spectrum and repeating above step (e), (g) repeating step (f)

until the righthand pulse reaches the right end of the NMR
signal spectrum,
(h) defining a center frequency centered between the lefthand and the
righthand peak and determining a correlation frequency (f
cor
) as that center frequency
for which said integral is maximum,
(i) locating all peaks in the NMR signal spectrum, (j) selecting one of the
located peaks positioned to one side of the correlation frequency as the Larmor

frequency of water,
(k) selecting one of the located peaks positioned to the other side of the
correlation frequency as the Larmor frequency of fat, and
(l) outputting to the transceiver on the NMR system an RF frequency
command (CF) which is based on the determined water or fat Larmor frequency.
The method as recited in claim 1 which includes filtering the acquired NMR
signal.
The method as recited in claim 1 in which the spectral density function depicts
two pulses separated by the chemical shift frequency of fat and water expected on the

NMR system.
The method as recited in claim 1 in which the two selected peaks are located
within predetermined regions spaced one-half the chemical shift frequency of fat and

water to either side of the correlation frequency.
The method as recited in claim 4 in which one of the selected peaks is located
by calculating the center of mass of the transformed NMR signal within one of said

regions.
