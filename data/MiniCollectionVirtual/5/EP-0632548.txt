<ABSTRACT>
Commutators (30) of armatures (10) for electric motors 
or other dynamo-electric machines are finished by 

subjecting them to inspection (70) and turning operations (116,118). 
The first inspection operation determines the minimum 

amount of material that can be cut while producing a 
high quality armature. This determination may indicate 

that no formal turning is required, only finishing. 
The turning operation, if applicable, cuts the 

commutator (30) to a substantially cylindrical shape which 
is substantially concentric with the axis of rotation (12) 

of the armature (10). The finishing operation, which may be 
performed by the same mechanism as the turning 

operation, imparts a desired axial roughness to the 
cylindrical commutator surface. The commutators may be 

inspected after the turning and finishing operations to 
generate data useful for such purposes as automatically 

modifying the turning and finishing operations 
performed on subsequent commutators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and
apparatus for finishing the surfaces of commutators on
armatures for electric motors or other dynamo-electric
machines.The condition of the finished surface of a
dynamo-electric machine armature commutator is of
considerable importance to the satisfactory operation
of the machine. For example, in an electric motor
which has a cylindrical commutator surface on its
armature, perfect roundness and concentricity of the
finished commutator surface helps ensure steady contact
between the rotating commutator and the stationary
brushes which bear on the commutator during operation
of the motor. On the other hand, the surface of the
commutator is preferably neither too smooth nor too
rough. If the commutator surface is too smooth, the
commutator will not cause the brushes to "run in"
properly, which may cause undue current concentrations
or arcing in the regions of contact between the brushes
and the commutator. If the commutator surface is too
rough, the brushes may wear too rapidly. Commutator
surface conditions such as these become more important
with increased motor speed, and there is growing
interest in motors that operate at higher speeds. There is also increasing interest in motor
manufacturing equipment that can make motors more
quickly. This means that the traditional quality
control methods, which involve periodically testing
completed motor parts, may not detect defects (e.g.,
due to worn or broken tooling, or tooling which is
improperly or sub-optimally adjusted) early enough to
prevent the production of large quantities of
unacceptable parts.A desired increase in manufacturing speed
also means that many traditional manufacturing systems,
which include process steps that limit the speed at
which motors can be manufactured, must be revised. For
example, traditional commutator turning operations
require that commutators be turned to a predetermined
diameter and then turned again to finish the surface of
the commutator. This typically results in a
substantial portion of at least some of the commutators
being cut off (through the first turning operation).
As such, the armatures must be formed from commutator
bars that initially are artificially thick resulting in
excessive supply costs for copper (a typical commutator
material) which is not part of the finished product.In view of the foregoing, it is an object of
this invention to provide improved methods and
apparatus for finishing commutator surfaces.It is another object of this invention to
provide commutator
