<DESCRIPTION>
Currently used friction reducing systems utilize a process of injecting a high
molecular weight friction reducing polymer solution into conduits containing flowing
hydrocarbon. The material to be injected is normally extremely viscous and difficult
to handle, particularly at low temperatures. Depending upon the temperature of the
flowing hydrocarbon and the concentration at which the friction reducing polymer
solution is injected, significant time elapses before dissociation and resulting friction
reduction occurs. In addition, complex equipment for storage, dissolving, pumping
and injecting metered quantities of friction reducing material into flowing hydrocarbon
is necessary.Highly effective friction reducing polymers are described in the art.
Representative samples of such art are U.S. Patent No. 3,692,676 which teaches a
method for reducing friction loss for pumpable fluids through pipelines by adding a
minor amount of a high molecular weight noncrystalline polymer. U.S. Patent No.
3,884,252 teaches the use of polymer crumb as a friction reducing material.The use of high molecular weight polymers as friction reducers for pipelines
carrying fluids under turbulent flow conditions is increasing as energy demands
increase and power costs increase. Friction reduction is a phenomenon known to
depend upon the high molecular weight of the polymer additive and its ability to
dissolve in the hydrocarbon under turbulent flow conditions.One drawback to the use of high molecular weight polymers for friction
reduction is their very slow dissolution rate. Solid polymers of these types can take
days to dissolve in some cases even though friction reduction is greatly enhanced
once dissolution has occurred. This problem can be overcome to a great extent by
using solutions of predissolved polymer. However, such high molecular weight
polymer solutions become very viscous as the polymer content increases, thus limiting
the practical application of these solutions to those containing no more than about 15
weight percent polymer. Additionally, even in this predissolved state, complete 
polymer dissociation in the flowing hydrocarbon can be slow. The equipment used
for injection of the polymer solution can become very complicated and expensive.Friction reducing polymers, being of high molecular weight, are solids at
normal temperatures. Such polymers can be finely subdivided by grinding at very low
(cryogenic) temperatures. However, the polymer solids tend to agglomerate as the
polymer warms to ambient temperatures. EP-A-0
