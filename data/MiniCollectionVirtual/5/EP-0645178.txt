<ABSTRACT>
A device for the processing of liquid or paste foodstuff 
substances comprises a container inside which are provided 

a primary rotating shaft to which are connected the means 
for mixing the substance and a second shaft to which are 

connected the means for emulsifying or agitating the 
substance. The rotating shafts are driven by independent 

motors and consist of a hollow external shaft and an 
internal shaft mounted coaxially one inside the other and 

rotating independently of each other. The mixing and 
emulsifying means are removably fitted to the respective 

shafts by sleeves coaxial with the shafts themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for processing 
liquid- or paste-type foodstuff substances which require 
agitation, mixing or emulsification. Typical applications for the device according to the 
present invention are found in pasteurizers, dasher or 
beater apparatuses and, in particular, cream-makers. Cream-makers are already known which generally comprise a 
cylindrical container with vertical axis, inside of which 
is one or more paddles which rotates at low speed and 
mixes the substance, the paddles being driven by an 
electric motor incorporated into the structure of the 
machine. However, such cream-makers are not suitable for 
the preparation of products which require emulsification 
or energetic agitation of the treated substance. These 
treatments necessitate the use of suitable devices which 
rotate at a relatively high speed compared to the mixing 
paddles. A partial remedy to this drawback is achieved by adding an 
external motor unit, fitted above the lid of the 
container, whose drive shaft passes through a hole in the 
lid and carries means for agitating or emulsifying the 
substances on its opposite end. An arrangement such as that illustrated in Fig.1 of the 
attached drawings is impractical because of the 
obstruction caused by the external lid-mounted motor unit  
 
and its mounting, which interferes with the normal 
operations of loading the ingredients and checking the 
product during the treatment. It is also obvious that an external electric motor with 
its power-supply cables both constitutes a potential 
hazard for the operator and is aesthetically unpleasing. The object of the present invention is to propose a 
liquid- or paste-foodstuff processing device which 
overcomes the drawbacks created by parts fitted above the 
lid of the container and which enables both the simple 
mixing treatment and the simultaneous mixing and 
emulsifying or agitation treatment to be carried out. A further object of the present invention is to provide a 
liquid- or paste-foodstuff processing device which is 
safer for the operator. These objects are achieved by the present invention which 
relates to a liquid- or paste-foodstuff processing device, 
of the type comprising a container inside which is a 
primary rotating shaft to which are attached means for 
mixing the substance and a secondary rotating shaft to 
which are attached means for emulsifying or agitating the 
substances, characterized in that said rotating shafts 
comprise an internal shaft and an external hollow shaft

which are attached means for emulsifying or agitating the 
substance, characterized in that said rotating shafts 

comprise an internal shaft and an external hollow shaft 
which are mounted coaxially one inside the other and which 

can rotate independently of each other. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said means for emulsifying or agitating the substance are 

removable from its respective shaft. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said means for emulsifying or agitating the substance are 

connected to the internal shaft of said coaxial shafts by 
a first sleeve provided at its extremity with means for 

engaging said internal shaft at the extremity opposite to 
the driven extremity to allow said first sleeve to be 

rotated by said internal shaft. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said means for mixing the substance are removable from its 

respective shaft.

characterized in that said second sleeve is mounted 

coaxially inside said first sleeve and it is able to 
rotate independently of said first sleeve. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said shafts are mounted, free to 

rotate, inside a third sleeve which is solid with the 
container and coaxial 
with said first and second sleeves, 
said first and second sleeves being mounted outside said 

third sleeve and being able to rotate independently of 
said third sleeve. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said shafts are contra-rotating. 
A device according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that said shafts are driven by 

independent motors.
