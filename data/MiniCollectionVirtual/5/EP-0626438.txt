<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal composition, comprising a 
main chain-type mesomorphic polymer and a mesomorphic 

monomer and showing a smectic phase including a 
plurality of molecular layers, wherein a linkage of a 

covalent bond is present between adjacent molecular 
layers among the plurality molecular layers. Because 

of the presence of the covalent bond linkage between 
the molecular layers, the elastic energy of the liquid 

crystal per se relating to the elastic energy between 
the smectic liquid crystal molecular layers can be 

controlled to provide a uniform alignment. The 
mesomorphic polymer preferably has a structure 

represented by the following formula (1): 

wherein A denotes a terminal flexible chain group, M 
denotes a mesogen group, F denotes a spacer flexible 

chain group, x is 0 or 1, B denotes an ester bond 
group, ether bond group, thioester bond group, 

dimethylsiloxane bond group or thioether bond group, 
and y is 1 - 200.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal composition and, a liquid crystal device
containing the composition, particularly a liquid
crystal composition and a liquid crystal device wherein
the alignment and physical property of a liquid crystal
having a layer structure, such as smectic liquid
crystal, have been controlled. The present invention
further relates to a novel mesomorphic compound, a
process for producing the same and a liquid crystal
composition containing the same capable of forming a
liquid crystal layer suitable for such a liquid crystal
device.There has been a well known type of liquid
crystal devices using TN (twisted nematic) type liquid
crystals as shown, for example, in "Voltage-Dependent
Optical Activity of a Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal"
by M. Schadt and W. Helfrich, Applied Physics Letters,
Vol. 18, No. 4 (Feb. 15, 1971), pp. 127-128. In this
type of liquid crystal devices, the number of picture
elements have been restricted, because there is a
problem that a crosstalk phenomenon occurs when a
device of a matrix electrode structure with a high
density of picture elements is driven according to a 
multiplexing driving scheme. Further, their uses for
display have been limited because of slow electric
field response and poor visual angle characteristics.As another type of liquid crystal device,
there has been known one comprising a plurality of
picture elements each connected to and subject to
switching by a thin film transistor as a switching
element. This type of liquid crystal device, however,
is accompanied with problems such that production of
thin film transistors on a substrate is very
complicated, and production of a display device with a
large picture area or screen is difficult.In order to obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks
of the conventional types of liquid crystal
devices, Clark and Lagerwall have proposed the use of a
liquid crystal device wherein a ferroelectric liquid
crystal is disposed in a thin layer having a thickness
less than 5 times that of the spiral pitch thereof so
that its spiral structure is unwound to develop a
bistability (e.g., U.S. patent No. 4367924). As the
bistable liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal
showing a chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) or H phase
(SmC*) is generally used.Such a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) has
very rapid response speed on account of having
spontaneous polarization, can also exhibit memorizable
bistable state and further have excellent vision angle 
characteristic, and therefore it is suitable for a
d
