<ABSTRACT>
Device for monitoring and checking "in the cold state" the inflation pressure of the tyres (14) of a vehicle including means for monitoring the inflation pressure of the said tyres with a central processing unit (9) as well as a take-off (plug) (12) placed on the vehicle, and connected to the central unit (9) and connectable to a portable checking device (13). This device (13) can power and communicate with the central unit (9) for checking the pressure of the tyres "in the cold state".

<CLAIMS>
A device for monitoring and checking the
inflation pressure when the tyres (14) of a vehicle are

stopped, comprising:

means (1) for measuring the inflation pressure of
each tyre (14);
a central processing unit (9) capable of analysing
said measurements with reference to ranges of stored

values and thus detecting abnormal values;
means (5, 6, 7, 8) for transmitting said
measurements to said central processing unit (9);
means for transmitting an alarm to the driver of
the vehicle;
autonomous means (12, 13) for displaying the
inflation pressure of each of the tyres from outside

the vehicle;

characterised in that the autonomous means (12, 13)
comprise means for supplying said central processing

unit (9) with power and for communicating therewith.
A device for monitoring and checking the cold
inflation pressure of tyres (14) of a vehicle according

to claim 1, wherein the autonomous means (12, 13)
comprise a portable checking box (13), equipped with

autonomous electric supply means, that can be connected
to a socket (12) placed on the vehicle and connected to

said central processing unit (9).
A device for monitoring and checking the cold
inflation pressure (14) of the tyres of a vehicle

according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the
ranges of recommended cold inflation pressure values of

each tyre (14) of the vehicle which are stored in the
central processing unit (9) can be 
modified by the
portable checking box (13).
