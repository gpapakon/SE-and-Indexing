<ABSTRACT>
A method of electrically charging a material to be 
charged by bringing a charging member impressed with a 

voltage into physical contact with the material to be 
charged, wherein the charging member is constituted by a 

flexible and electrically conducting endless sheet and a 
rotary insulating brush which supports the endless sheet 

at a position where said endless sheet and said material 
to be charged are in contact with each other and gives a 

pushing force to said endless sheet, and said endless 
sheet is driven actively or passively together with the 

insulating brush at a speed substantially in synchronism 
with the material to be charged while applying a 

charging voltage to said endless sheet. This method 
makes it possible to uniformly and stably charge the 

surface of the photosensitive material even when defects 
such as pinholes or the like exist in the surface of the 

photosensitive material, without causing the life of the 
photosensitive material to be shortened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically 
charging method which is capable of mainly charging the 
surface of a photosensitive material without relying 
upon the corona discharge, and to an electrically 
charging device used therefor. In an electrophotographic method, an image is 
formed by uniformly charging the surface of a 
photosensitive material, exposing a document image to 
light to form an electrostatic latent image that 
corresponds to the document image on the surface of the 
photosensitive material, developing the electrostatic 
latent image and transferring the developed image. In the above-mentioned method of forming image, in 
general, the surface of the photosensitive material is 
electrically charged (mainly charged) by the corona 
charging accompanied, however, by the generation of 
ozone which is a cause of environmental pollution. In 
order to avoid the generation of ozone in recent years, 
methods have been proposed for mainly charging the 
surface of the photosensitive material by bringing an 
electrically conducting rubber roller into frictional 
contact with the surface of the photosensitive material 
while applying a bias voltage (Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publications Nos. 149669/1988 and 267667/1989). According to the above-mentioned charging method 
based upon the frictional contact, however, the 
uniformity in the electric charge is lost when foreign 
matters such as dust, paper powder and the like are 
trapped between the electrically conducting rubber  
 
roller and the photosensitive material and it becomes 
difficult to stably carry out the electric charging. 
Moreover, when the surface of the photosensitive 
material is not perfectly cleaned permitting the toner 
to stay on the surface, then the remaining toner is 
adhered to the surface of the photosensitive material 
during the formation of image causing the photosensitive 
material to lose its durability. Furthermore, uniform 
charging of the photosensitive material is not 
accomplished by the application of a DC bias voltage 
only unless an AC bias voltage is applied in 
combination. In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the 
present applicant has previously proposed a method of 
electrically charging the photosensitive material by 
bringing a flexible electrically conducting sheet into 
frictional contact with the surface of the 
photosensitive material by using an electrically 
conducting brush roller while applying a DC voltage to 
the roller (see Japanese Patent Application No. 
68148/1992).
