<ABSTRACT>
A light emitting device (10) incorporates a layer (12) of porous silicon of low dimensionality surmounted by a discontinuous layer of silver in the form of discrete islands (20). A digitated electrode (13) is connected to the islands (20). The islands (20) have diameters in the range 5nm to 20nm and spacings in the range 10nm to 50nm, and they form a Schottky diode structure on the silicon (12). Under electrical bias, the diode structure conducts and light is generated. The device (10) is produced by vacuum deposition of silver on to a silicon wafer at a temperature which  provides for the silver to separate into individual balls (20). The wafer is then anodised to produce a porous layer incorporating columns of silicon and silicon dioxide surmounted by respective silver islands (20). Each silver island (20) protects the underlying silicon (21) from the anodising medium, and subsequently provides an electrical contact to the silicon.

<DESCRIPTION>
LIGHT EMITTING DEVICEThis invention relates to a light emitting device and to a method of making such a device. The invention is particularly directed to a device which employs luminescent semiconductor properties.There has been much research recently into visible electroluminescence from porous silicon, which is a sponge-like structure made by first anodising and then etching a silicon substrate. Three papers which discuss the present state of the art are as follows: L T Canham, "Silicon Quantum wire array fabrication by electrochemical and chemical dissolution of wafers"; Appl. Phys. Lett. 57 (10), 3rd September 1990, page 1046; Nobuyoshi Koshida and Hideki Koyama, , "Visible electroluminescence from porous silicon", Appl. Phys. Lett. 60 (3), 20th January 1992, page 347; and Volker Lehman and Ulrich Gόsele, "Porous Silicon: Quantum sponge structures grown via a self-adjusting etching process", Adv. Mater. 4 (1992) No. 2, page 114.The basic prior art light emitting device is disclosed in the aforementioned paper by Koshida and Koyama. It consists of a diode structure made from a substrate of p-type silicon, on top of which is formed a porous layer, typically 0.2 μm to 1.0 μm thick. Electrodes are placed both on the porous layer and on the underside of the substrate so that an electrical bias potential can be applied to the diode. One of the electrodes, that on the porous layer, is made of semi-transparent material so that light generated within the diode structure may be emitted.The porous layer is formed by subjecting the top surface of the substrate to anodisation. This is believed to produce a porous layer comprising an array of columns or wires of low dimensionality, vertical to the surface, and separated by holes or spaces and wherein each column comprises silicon embedded in silicon oxide. Generally the porosity of the layer is increased by subsequent etching. An etchant is used which thins the columns by chemical dissolution, with a resultant increase in the size of the spaces between the columns. Light is generated within the diode 

structure in response to electrical bias. There is currently some uncertainty in the scientific world as to how the structure emits light.The present invention provides a light emitting device incorporating porous material of low dimensionality consisting at least partly of semiconductor material and produced by an etching process, upon the porous material a discontinuous layer comprising islands of electrically conducting and etch resistant material, together with
