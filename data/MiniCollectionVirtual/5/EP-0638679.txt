<ABSTRACT>
A nonwoven fabric having an excellent water 
absorption, a satisfactory softness and hand feeling, and 

a superior processability and wet mechanical strength, 
comprises synthetic fibers and water-absorbent cellulosic 

fibers intertwined with each other, the water-absorbent 
cellulosic fibers comprising cross-linked carboxymethyl 

cellulose fibers having a carboxymethyl group-substitution 
degree of 0.35 to 1.6, and being produced by 

forming a precursory nonwoven web from the synthetic 
fibers and cellulose fibers intertwined with each other, 

and carboxy methylating and cross-linking separately or 
simultaneously the cellulose fibers in the precursory 

nonwoven fabric by using a carboxymethylating agent and a 
cross-linked agent, to convert the precursory nonwoven 

web to a water-absorbent nonwoven fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-absorbent
nonwoven fabric and a process for producing the
same. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a water-absorbent nonwoven fabric comprising synthetic
fibers and water-absorbent cellulosic fibers intertwined
with each other, having a high water-absorption similar
to that of conventional high water-absorbent resins, and
exhibiting a satisfactory softness, hand feeling,
processability and an excellent mechanical sheet strength
even after absorbing water therein, and a process for
producing the same.Recently, as water-absorbent material capable
of absorbing water and an aqueous solutions containing
salts, for example, an aqueous common salt solution, a
group of resinous materials, which are referred to as
high water-absorbent resins, are known. Basically, the
water absorbent resinous materials are produced by
slightly cross-linking water-soluble polymeric materials
to convert them to water-insoluble and water-absorbent
materials. As examples of the high water-absorbent
materials, starch derivatives which are produced by
graft-copolymerizing acrylonitrile with starch and
hydrolyzing the graft-polymerized product; cross-linked
starch derivatives which are produced by graft-copolymerizing
acrylic acid metal salts with starch;
cross-linked acrylic acid copolymers which are produced
by copolymerizing acrylic acid with a copolymerizing
cross-linking agent; and methyl methacrylate-vinyl
acetate copolymer derivatives which are produced by
hydrolyzing methyl methacrylate-vinyl acetate copolymers, 
are known and some of these are now used in practice.
Almost all of the conventional water-absorbent materials
are supplied in the form of a fine powder or grains.
Therefore, when they are practically utilized, they are
usually not used alone but used together with a suitable
supporting material, to form a composite article. For
example, in the production of disposable diapers, usually
the water-absorbent resin powder is evenly distributed
between a pair of fluff pulp mats. In the production of
other water-absorbent articles, the water-absorbent resin
powder is employed by being interposed between a pair of
sheet materials, for example, paper sheets, nonwoven
fabrics or synthetic resin sheets.In the production of the above-mentioned
composite articles, a desired amount of the water-absorbent
resin powder must be evenly sprinkled on or in
the supporting material and the sprinkled water-absorbent
resin powder must be fixed on or in the supporting
material so as to
