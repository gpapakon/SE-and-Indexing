<ABSTRACT>
The joining piece for automatic fuel-oil air exhausters is characterised by a housing block (1) with a continuous bore (2) for the connection of the supply line from the tank, a continuous bore (3) for the connection of the return line from the burner, a continuous bore (4) for the connection of the feed line to the burner, and connection bores (5, 6, 7) to the three continuous bores (2, 3 and 4 resp.) for the connection of up to three fuel-oil air exhausters connected in parallel and arranged in a row. The mounting of several fuel-oil air exhausters is simplified by the joining piece. By means of the joining piece, the air-exhaust capacity can be increased or reduced with effortless ease.
