<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel therapeutical use of L-carnitine,
some acyl L-carnitines and their pharmacologically acceptable
salts for treating seizure disorders (epilepsy).More specifically, the present invention relates to the coordinated
use of L-carnitine, acyl L-carnitines or their pharmacologically
acceptable salts and valproate (i.e. a pharmacologically acceptable salt of
valproic acid, such as sodium or magnesium valproate) for decreasing the
seizure frequency in epileptic patients.Within the scope of the present invention, by "co-ordinated use"
of the aforesaid compounds it is meant indifferently both the co-administration,
i.e. the substantially concomitant supplementation of L-carnitine
or acyl L-carnitine or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof
and valproate, as active ingredients, and the administration of a
combination preparation containing a mixture of the aforesaid active
ingredients, in addition to suitable excipients, if any.L-carnitine supplementation concomitantly administered with
valproate therapy in epileptic patients, particularly epileptic young
children, has been already disclosed although the therapeutical effect
aimed at does not allow the novel use, object of the present invention, to 
be in any way foreseen.Valproate is a remarkably efficacious anticonvulsant; however, in
some cases it can cause a severe or fatal hepatotoxicity. Valproate
interferes with carnitine metabolism and this is the cause of valproate
toxicity.As known, carnitine performs two basic physiologic functions.
First, it carries long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial
membrane into the mitochondrion matrix where the beta-oxidation takes
place. Secondly, carnitine helps to regulate the intramitochondrial ratio
of acyl CoA to free CoA. Acyl carnitine transferase located on the inner
wall of inner mitochondrial membrane favours the binding of carnitine to
acylCoA forming acylcarnitine esters for transport out of the
mitochondrion.The same reaction releases and makes available the CoA within the
mitochondrion. This carnitine function is essential since it removes
excessive (and potentially toxic) short and medium chain fatty acids from
the mitochondrion, maintaining sufficient free CoA within the
mitochondrion to provide adequate cell energy metabolism.Tissue (mitochondrial) carnitine deficiency affects the energy
metabolism by hindering the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids,
allowing the accumulation of acyl CoA in mitochondria to occur, which 
results in lower amounts
