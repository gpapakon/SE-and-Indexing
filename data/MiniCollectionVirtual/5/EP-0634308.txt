<ABSTRACT>
A mount (1) for a handheld radio telephone which can be optionally operated either independently as a handheld radio telephone or as a handset which is connected to a cable with a plug element, has manually actuable locking means (9, 12; 10, 11) which are designed in such a way that the handheld radio telephone can optionally be locked and unlocked together with the connected plug element or without the latter, the plug element remaining locked in the mount (1) in the latter case. The mount (1) takes the form of a quiver into which the handheld radio telephone can be inserted from above.

<CLAIMS>
Device having a holder (1) for a hand-held radiotelephone and
having a cable (31) arranged to be connected to an outlet of the hand-held

radiotelephone by means of a plug element (32), characterised by locking
means (9, 18, 20, 12; 10, 19, 11, 21.1, 21.2), which are constructed so

that the hand-held radiotelephone can be released, optionally together
with the connected plug element (32) or without the same, and removed

from the holder (1) and can subsequently be reintroduced into the holder
(1) and locked, in the latter case the plug element (32) remaining located

in position in the holder (1).
Holder (1) for a device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the locking means (9, 18, 20, 12; 10, 19, 11, 21.1, 21.2) are manually

operable.
Holder according to claim 2, characterised in that the locking means
(9, 18, 20, 12; 10, 19, 11, 21.1, 21.2), comprise two separate buttons (9,

10) for locking and releasing the hand-held radiotelephone with or without
plug element (32).
Holder according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that it is in the
form of a socket holder, so that the hand-held radiotelephone is insertable

in the direction of its longitudinal axis.
Holder according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in that the
buttons (9, 10) are arranged on opposite long sides (3.1, 3.2) of the holder

(1). 
Holder according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that
the locking means (9, 18, 20, 12; 10, 19, 11, 21.1, 21.2) for locking and

releasing the hand-held radiotelephone comprise a locking element (11),
which engages in a battery compartment slot of the hand-held

radiotelephone.
Holder (1) according to any one of claims 2 to 6, characterised in
that it comprises an element tuned to the hand-held radiotelephone to be

inserted, which element acts as a line interrupter when the hand-held
radiotelephone is inserted.
Holder according to any one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that it
comprises an ejector mechanism, so that the hand-held radiotelephone,

as it is released, is expelled from the locked position.
Cable (31) having a plug element (32) for a device according to
claim 1, characterised in that the plug element (32) is designed (33) for

optional retention in the holder (1).
Cable (31) having a plug element (32) according to claim 9,
characterised by a rigidly projecting aerial lead (35) which, when a plug

(34) is plugged in - at an underside of the hand-held radiotelephone -, can
be connected to an aerial connecting socket provided at the side of the

hand-held radiotelephone.
Cable (31) having a plug element (32) according to claim 9 or 10,
characterised in that it comprises a coiled cable (37) and a coaxial cable

(38) led close to or along the axis of the coil.
