<ABSTRACT>
An infrared sensitive silver halide photographic element is 
disclosed comprising a support and at least one silver halide emulsion 

layer spectrally sensitized to the infrared portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. In particular, an infrared sensitive color photographic element, 

capable of providing full color images without exposure to corresponding 
visible radiation, is disclosed, said element comprising at least three silver 

halide emulsion layers on a substrate, each associated with different 
photographic color image forming materials, such as color couplers 

capable of forming dyes of different colors upon reaction with an oxidized 
color photographic developer, diffusing dyes, bleachable dyes, or oxidized 

leuco dyes. The three emulsion layers are sensitized to three different 
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum with at least two layers 

sensitized to different regions of the infrared region of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. The infrared sensitive element is characterized in that at least 

one infrared sensitized emulsion layer is associated with a 3-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole 
antifogging agent represented by the formula : 


wherein R₁ and R₂ each independently represents hydrogen or an alkyl 
group, the sum of carbon atoms of R₁ and R₂ is 1 or 2, and at least one of 

R₁ and R₂ is a perfluoroalkyl group. 
The infrared sensitive photographic element has high sensitivity to 
infrared radiation and undergoes less change in sensitivity during storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silver halide photographic elements
sensitive to infrared radiation. In particular, the present invention relates
to color photographic elements having at least three silver halide
emulsion layers associated with color image providing materials, each
emulsion layer being sensitized to a different region of the
electromagnetic spectrum and at least two emulsion layers being sensitized
to radiation within the infrared region of the electromagnetic
spectrum, wherein at least one infrared sensitized emulsion layer is
associated with a mercaptotriazole antifogging agent.It is well known that silver halide photographic elements can be
spectrally sensitized to infrared radiation. See Mees and James, The
Theory of Photographic Processes, 3rd edition, The MacMillan
Company, 1966, pages 198 and 199. Silver halides are intrinsically
sensitive only to light in the blue region of the spectrum. Therefore, when
silver halides are to be exposed to other wavelengths of radiation, such as
green light, red light or infrared radiation, a spectral sensitizing dye is
required to render silver halide sensitive to such radiation. As known in
the art, silver halides having adsorbed on the grains spectral sensitizing
dyes can be made sensitive to radiation of a wavelength other than the
intrinsic blue sensitivity.With the advent of lasers, and particularly solid state laser diodes
emitting in the infrared region of the spectrum (e.g, 700 to 1500 nm), the
interest in infrared sensitization has greatly increased. Many different
processes and articles useful for exposure to laser diodes have been
proposed. These include C.A.T. (Computer Assisted Tomography)
scanners, graphic arts products and infrared sensitive false color-sensitized 
photographic elements as described in US 4,619,892. In this
patent, photographic elements are described which are capable of
providing full color images without exposure to corresponding visible
radiation. This false address elements comprise at least three silver
halide emulsions layers on a substrate, each associated with different
photographic color image forming materials and sensitized to three
different portions of the spectrum with at least two layers sensitized to
different regions of the infrared region of the spectrum.It is also known that the addition of specific organic compounds to
a silver halide photographic material in addition to the spectrally
sensitizing dyes can increase the spectrally sensitized speed of the
emulsion by more than one order of magnitude.
