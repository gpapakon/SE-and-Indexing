<ABSTRACT>
A disc recording apparatus and a file management method 
are disclosed. In the disc recording apparatus and the file 

management method, a file management area is provided in a 
predetermined position in a recordable program area (15) of 

a disc- shaped recording medium (10) by formatting, so that 
file management information recorded in a replay-only area 

(12) is transferred to the file management area, to update 
the file management information of the file management area 

each time the data file is recorded in the recordable 
program area (15). Thus, it is possible to uniformly 

control each of data files recorded in the replay-only 
program area (12) and the recordabl
e program area (15) of 
the disc-shaped recording medium (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording apparatus for a disc-shaped 
recording medium having a replay-only area having at least 
one data file and the file management information for managing 
the data file recorded thereon and a recordable area capable of 
recording data files. There have so far been known disc-shaped recording media, 
such as a replay-only optical disc, e.g., a so-called compact 
disc having data pre-recorded as pits, and a recording/reproducing 
disc, such as a magneto-optical disc or a hard disc 
having a data recordable area formed by a magnetic recording film 
or a magneto-optical recording film. There is also known a 
hybrid disc in which the replay-only area and the recording area 
are present in a mixed or hybrid state. For recording computer data on such optical disc, a data 
file structure is employed. With the hybrid disc, file management data indicating the 
file structure of the replay-only area is recorded in the replay-only 
area. That is, since there is no recorded data at the time 
of shipment, it is impossible to record management data of the 
file structure for the recordable area in the replay-only area.  
 
Thus it is necessary to record file management data for the 
recordable area in the recordable area. This renders it possible to effect file management for the 
hybrid disc for both the replay-only area and the recordable 
area. However, since the file management data is present 
separately in the replay-only area and the recordable area, the 
file management data in these two areas need to be managed 
separately, resulting in complicated management. Although transcription of the boot directory is contemplated 
for the hybrid disc, this concept is basically intended for 
different purposes since it is not related to the file management 
data. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a disc recording apparatus and a file management system 
whereby it is possible to uniformly control each of data files 
recorded in the replay-only program area and the recordable area 
of the disc-shaped recording medium having the recordable area 
and the replay-only program area in which at least one data file 
is recorded and in which the file management data for controlling 
the data file is recorded. According to the present invention, there is provided a disc 
recording apparatus and a file management method. With a disc-shaped 
recording medium having a replay-only program area having 
at least one data file and file management information for  
 
managing

<CLAIMS>
A disc recording apparatus for recording a data file in 
a user recordable area (15) on a disc-shaped recording 

medium (10) having a replay-only area (12) in addition to 
said user recordable area (15), said replay-only program 

area (12) having pre-recorded therein at least one data file 
and the file management information for managing said at 

least one data file, comprising 
   reproducing means (122) for reproducing the information 

recorded on said disc-shaped recording medium (10), 
   recording means (120) for recording the information in 

said user recordable area (15) of the disc-shaped recording 
medium (10), and 

   control means (126) for controlling said reproducing 
means (122) from said replay-only area (12) for reproducing 

said file management information at the time of initializing 
the user recordable area (15) of the disc-shaped recording 

medium (10), said control means (126) also controlling said 
recording means (120) for recording said file management 

information at a pre-set location in said user recordable 
area (15). 
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 1 
wherein, when a new data file is recorded in the user 

recordable area (15) of the disc-shaped recording 
medium (10), the file management information updated with 

the recording of said data file is overwritten by said 
recording means (120) at said pre-set location in said user 

recordable area under control by said control means(126). 
The disc recording apparatus as claimed in claim 2 
wherein, each time a new data file is recorded in the user 

recordable area (15) of the disc-shaped recording 
medium (10), the file management information updated with 

the recording of said data file is overwritten by said 
recording means (120) at said pre-set location in said user 

 
recordable area (15) under control by said control means 

(126).

   alarming means for alarming that the recordable area of 
the disc-shaped recording medium (10) is not initialized, 

   wherein the file management information recorded at the 
pre-set location of the user recordable area (15) is 

reproduced by said reproducing means (120) at the starting 
time under control by said control means, said alarming 

means issuing an alarm in case of failure in reproduction 
under control by said control means (126). 
A method for managing data files for a disc-shaped 
recording medium (10) having a replay-only area in addition
