<ABSTRACT>
Brush for cleaning teeth, comprising a support handle and 
a bristle-carrying head joined via a flexible hinge, the axis 

of which is arranged in a plane essentially parallel to the 
plane of the head and is oriented perpendicularly with respect 

to the longitudinal axis of the brush. This hinge consists of 
an assembly of two flexible, thin, side bridge-pieces formed 

as one piece with the handle and the head and constituting the 
main element for joining and connecting together the latter, 

and of a mass of elastomeric filling material injected into 
the space between said bridge-pieces. The handle, the head 

and the bridge-pieces are made of a relatively rigid material 
(for example polypropylene) having a chemical affinity with 

the softer material (for example a polyolefin-based elastomer) 
constituting the filling mass. The hardness of this mass 

determines the rigidity of the hinge, depending on the 
intended use of the brush (soft, medium or hard; for adults or 

for children).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothbrush provided
with a bristle-carrying head mounted on the handle via a hinge
which is flexible, i.e. capable of assuming any angle during
use.Toothbrushes normally comprise a substantially straight
handle part which extends into a head part which is also
straight and on which the cleaning bristles are mounted. In
the most well-known arrangements the head part is aligned with
the handle part. This arrangement has been adopted with
satisfactory results for very many years, despite the fact
that it is not particularly suitable - since it creates a few
problems during use - for cleaning the deep-lying zones
located behind the molars of the teeth.In order to overcome this problem it is known that for
some time so called "angular " toothbrushes have been
available commercially, said toothbrushes having in fact a
head which is bent at an angle with respect to the axes of the
handle. This angle - which to a certain extent imitates the
shape of a dental mirror - is intended to facilitate cleaning
of the convex parts of the teeth and of the zones located
behind the molars and the incisors. These toothbrushes,
however, are less suitable for cleaning the front part of the
teeth and in fact are generally unsuitable for cleaning the 
concave zones of the teeth.More recently so called "flexible" toothbrushes have also
been proposed, i.e. toothbrushes having the handle, or at
least a part of the handle, which is able to flex in the
direction of its length. Toothbrushes of this type are
described for example in DE-C1-39 23 495, DE-C2-42 23 697, DE-C1-42
22 931, DE-GM-89 03 911 and EP-A2-0.371.293. This
flexibility, however, is intended - as clearly stated in DE-C1-39
23 495 - to allow the cleaning pressure on the teeth to
be controlled more easily so as avoid damaging the latter.
For this reason, the flexing or hinging zone is located at a
middle point along the handle and in particular in a zone
where the thumb of the hand rests during use, i.e. in a zone
situated outside the mouth during use of the brush: only in
this way, in fact, is the user able to sense exactly how much
the brush is flexing and consequently how great the cleaning
pressure is.All of these known brushes, therefore, do not achieve the
aim which is that of the invention, namely that of
facilitating cleaning of all the parts of the teeth. This
problem, however, is dealt with in the document WO-92/17092,
which proposes a brush consisting of a handle and a bristle-carrying
head, the latter being mounted in a

<CLAIMS>
Toothbrush of the type comprising a rigid support handle (1) and a
bristle-carrying head (2) in the form of a flat body from which the

bristles (3) project perpendicularly, said head (2) being joined to the
end of the handle (1) via a flexible hinge, which is formed in part of a

semirigid, elastic, plastic material and in part of a soft elastomeric
material

characterized in that

said flexible hinge is formed by the combination of

two flexible, thin, side-bridge pieces (1a) made of semirigid plastic
material, formed in one piece with the handle (1) and the flat body of

the head (2) and constituting the main element for joining and connecting
together these latter, said two side-bridge pieces (1a) determining an

oscillating axis arranged in a plane essentially parallel to the plane of
the bristle-carrying head and oriented perpendicularly with respect to

the longitudinal axis of the brush
so that the bristle-carrying head is elastically yielding, at a

variable angle with respect to the handle, about said hinging
axis, while it remains perfectly rigid with respect to the

handle in a direction perpendicular to said axis, 
and
a filling mass (4) of soft elastomeric material injected into the space
between said side-bridge pieces and forming a stable linkage with these

latter, said filling mass constituting a secondary joining and connecting
element.
Toothbrush according to Claim 1, in which the handle (1), the
head (2) and the bridge-pieces (10) are made of a material having a

chemical affinity with the material constituting the filling 
mass (4) of elastomeric material.
Toothbrush according to Claim 1, in which the rigidity of
the hinge, depending on the intended use of the brush (soft,

medium or hard; for adults or for children), is determined
mainly by the hardness of the elastomeric material of the

filling mass (4).
Toothbrush according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, in which
the assembly consisting of handle (1), head (2) and bridge-pieces (1a) is

made of polypropylene, while the filling mass (4) consists of a
polyolefin-based elastomeric material.
