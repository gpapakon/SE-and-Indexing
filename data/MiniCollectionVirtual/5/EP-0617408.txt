<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
composite type magnetic head core slider for a rigid or hard 
magnetic disk drive, in which a core chip with a 
writing/reading portion is integrally positioned and fixed 
in a slider body having air-bearing portions, and a method 
of manufacturing such a magnetic head core slider. More 
particularly, the present invention is concerned with 
techniques for effectively improving the accuracy of a 
magnetic gap depth of the core chip and/or the flatness of 
the head core slider surface having the air-bearing 
portions, to assure high operating reliability of the head 
core slider. As an air-bearing or flying type magnetic head 
core slider for a rigid magnetic disk drive device, there is 
known a so-called "composite type" head core slider, which 
consists of a slider body and a core chip that are prepared 
independently of each other. The slider body has air-bearing 
portions, while the core chip has a writing/reading portion  
 
for writing and reading information on a magnetic disk. The 
slider body and the core chip are integrally assembled into 
the magnetic head core slider. This composite type magnetic 
head core slider, which is distinguished from a monolithic 
type, has a smaller thickness at the writing/reading portion 
and an accordingly lower inductance value of the 
writing/reading portion, and features improved operating 
characteristics for high-frequency writing and reading of 
information, as compared with the monolithic type. An example of a known method of manufacturing such 
composite type magnetic head core slider is illustrated in 
Figs. 15(a), 15(b) and 15(c), Described specifically, the 
head core slider consists of a slider body 40 and a core 
chip 50 which are prepared independently of or separately 
from each other. As shown in Fig. 15(a), the slider body 40 
has two air-bearing portions 42 in the form of two parallel 
rails formed on an upper surface thereof, and a coil-winding 
groove 44 and a slot 46 formed at one of the opposite ends 
thereof as seen in the direction of relative movement of the 
slider body 40 and a magnetic disk, namely, in the direction 
of extension of the air-bearing portions 42. The slot 46 is 
aligned with one of the two air-bearing portions 42, and the 
coil-winding groove 44 is provided for winding a coil on the 
core chip 50 inserted in the slot 46. As shown in Fig. 
15(b), the core chip 50 has a generally rectangular frame 
structure having a generally rectangular coil-winding 
aperture 58, and a track
