<ABSTRACT>
Circuits containing resonant tunneling devices are disclosed which 
offer significant advantages for realizing ultra-dense, ultra-high performance 

multivalued logic arithmetic integrated circuits. Multivalued logic circuits 
implemented with resonant tunneling devices can achieve increased speed 

and density over binary circuits and multiple-valued circuits implemented in 
conventional IC technologies since multiple binary bits are very efficiently 

processed by architectures which make use of devices with multiple negative 
transconductance regions. In one form of the invention, an adder for 

calculating the sum of two numbers represented by signed digit range-3 base-4 
words is constructed from summation circuits 
(40)
 which add corresponding 
digits of input words X and Y to form digit sums S
i
, signed range-5 to signed 
range-3 converter circuits 
(42)
 which use multi-level folding circuits 

(64)
 connected by voltage dividers to decompose the digit sums into an interim 
sum and carry digit, and a second set of summation circuits 
(40)
 which add 
interim sum and carry digits to produce the digits of the result. Preferably, 

the sum is likewise represented by a signed digit range-3 base-4 word. 
Preferably, the multi-level folding circuits contain resonant tunneling 

transistors (e.g. bipolar transistors with multiple-peak resonant tunneling 
diodes 
(52)
 integrated into the emitter).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to integrated circuit devices and more 
particularly to multivalued logic circuits comprising resonant tunneling 
devices. Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is 
described in connection with resonant tunneling devices and methods for 
implementing multivalued logic operations. Within the last decade, heteroepitaxial technology has allowed 
researchers to explore the electrical properties of a variety of superlattice, 
quantum well, and resonant tunneling structures. The first proposals and 
investigations of the resonant tunneling diode were reported by Chang, 
Esaki, and Tsu (Applied Physics Letters, 24, p. 592) and subsequently given 
impetus by Sollner et al. (Applied Physics Letters, 43, p.588) who observed 
large negative differential resistance (hereinafter referred to as NDR) in 
these structures. Because only discrete energy states are available for charge 
transport through quantum wells, the current-voltage relationship of a 
resonant tunneling diode may exhibit a peak, i.e., for applied voltages 
increasing from zero, the diode current increases, then decreases for a range 
of larger applied voltages. Multiple peak resonant tunneling devices 
(hereinafter referred to as M-RTD) consisting of series combinations of RTDs 
in epitaxial stacks have also been demonstrated. Fifteen resonant peaks  
 
were achieved in a single heterostructure at room temperature recently 
fabricated at Texas Instruments. Since the initial investigations of the RTD, many three-terminal 
resonant tunneling devices have been proposed and demonstrated (see, for 
example, F. Capasso, S. Sen and F. Beltram, High Speed Semiconductor 
Devices (S.M. Sze, ed.), p. 465, John Wiley & Sons, New York). Integration of 
RTDs into one or another of the terminals of conventional transistors has led 
to a large family of resonant tunneling transistors. Among the most 
promising of these transistors are: the resonant tunneling bipolar transistor 
(RTBT) (see, for example, F. Capasso, S. Sen, and A.Y. Cho, Applied Physics 
Letters, 51, p. 526); the resonant tunneling hot electron transistor (RHET) 
(see, for example, N. Yokoyama et al., Solid State Electronics, 31, p. 577); and 
the resonant tunneling field effect transistor (RTFET). These devices are 
fabricated by placing RTDs in the emitter terminals of heterojunction bipolar 
transistors, hot electron transistors or field effect transistors, respectively. Nanoelectronic devices, such as resonant tunneling diodes and 
transistor
