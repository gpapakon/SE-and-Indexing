<ABSTRACT>
A display package, enabling a user to manipulate a tool having a pair of tool openings and that is positioned within the display package. The display package has a base (12) and a plate (14) having a plate opening having an edge. A first support element (28) extends from the base to the plate, wherein the first support element expansively engages the edge of the plate opening (62). A second support element (30) also is present that extends from the base (22) to the plate (14), wherein the first support element has a portion thereof having a size sufficient to be inserted through the first tool opening and the second support element having a portion thereof having a size sufficient to be inserted through the second tool opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to display packages and specifically
to a package used to display a tool such as locking pliers in a manner
which permits working manipulation of the hand tool by a prospective purchaser
at a point of sale.Display packages have been known for some time, and it is quite
customary to produce hand tools or other products enclosed within a package
made of transparent, stiff, flexible materials such as polyvinylchloride (PVC) and
secured to a card by heat and/or adhesive. Other types of display packages are
also known. The known display packages typically enclose the article of
merchandise; and it is normally quite difficult for a purchaser to touch or test the
packaged tool without destroying a blister or other type of package or removing
the tool from the package.Purchasers of tools, in general, and locking pliers specifically, particularly
professional tradesmen and craftsmen, look for product characteristics, such as
size and finish of the handles, the ability to lock the tool in certain positions.
They also often want to feel the operation of the tool, and to adjust the gap
between the jaws. The ability to manipulate hand tool parts prior to purchase is
a feature welcomed by customers and, therefore, a definite sales incentive to the
manufacturer.Display packages for tools are known in which some working portions of
the tools are accessible through the package. However, a drawback of 
conventional blister-and-card and clamshell-type tool packages is that existing
packages of this type do not allow locking pliers or similar tools to be displayed
and still function so that elements of the tool can be manipulated. Yet another
drawback of conventional blister-and-card packages is that the tool is not
substantially visible through the package.Thus, there is a need for a display package for tools which may be easily
and inexpensively produced. There is also a need for the display packages for
locking pliers to permit substantial product visibility, plus the ability to
manipulate, as well as to provide access to handles, jaws, and other parts of the
tool prior to purchase. Furthermore, there is a need for a package for locking,
pliers which, in addition to the above-described characteristics, may be easily hung
on store displays. GB-A-2243592 discloses to firmly secure a hand tool, e.g. pliers, to a card-shaped plate
by positive interengagement between three components, namely a V-shaped fastening
member, a V-shaped holding member and the plate itself. Said fastening member has

<CLAIMS>
A tool display package system, enabling a user to manipulate a
tool having a first tool opening and a second tool opening, said

tool being positioned within said display package comprising:

a base (12), formed as a substantially flat member;
a plate (14) having a plate opening (62) having an
edge, said plate being separated from said base by a

space (16);
a first support element (28) extending from said base
(12) to said plate (14);
a second support element (30) extending from said base
(12) to said plate (14);

the tool display package system 
characterized in that
said first support element (28) is expansively engaging
said edge of said plate opening (62).
The tool display package system of claim 1, 
characterized by

a tool positioned between said base (12) and said plate (14), 
said tool having a first tool opening (152; 174) and a second

tool opening (154; 712), wherein said tool is operable while
positioned between said base (12) and said plate (14) and said

first support element (28) has a position inserted through said
first tool opening (152; 174) and said second support element

(30) has a portion inserted through said second tool opening
(154; 172).
The tool display package system of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
by
 a wall (26, 26') extending at an angle with respect to said
base (12).
The tool display package system of claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 said wall (26, 26') is attached to said base (12).
The tool display package system of claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 said angle is approximately 90°.

characterized
in that
 said first support element (28) has a free end that
expansively engages said edge of said plate opening (62).
The tool display package system of claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 said free end comprises a first arm (32) and a second arm
(34) separated from each other by a distance that is greater
