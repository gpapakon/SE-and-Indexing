<ABSTRACT>
A tape dispenser (10) comprising a body (20) having an engagement 
portion to 

engage a salient (15) standing above a surface (12), 
means (38,39) to mount a reel (41) of tape (59) for 

rotation relative to the body (20) and guide means (44,50) to guide 
the tape (59) so as to be 

dispensed from the body (20) laterally adjacent said salient 
portion (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tape dispenser for dispensing tape from a
reel of tape. The invention is particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with a
tape dispenser for dispensing tape onto a surface closely adjacent to a salient
standing above the surface. For example, to dispense masking tape onto part of
a window which is closely adjacent to a frame of the window to prevent accidental
marking of the window during painting of the frame.Tape dispensers of various types are known, as shown for example in
U.S. Patents 3125263 which corresponds to the preamble of claim 1, and 3140217 to Harbour,
and U.S. Patent 3814643 to
Wagner. Such dispensers, whilst being suitable for some purposes, present
difficulties when it is desired to dispense tape onto a surface closely adjacent to
an upstanding salient, and furthermore, such dispensers are prone to lateral
movement during tape dispensing, with the result that the tape may not be
dispensed in a sufficiently linear manner. An object of the invention is to provide a new and improved tape
dispenser and more particularly a tape dispenser for dispensing tape onto a
surface closely adjacent to a salient standing above the surface.This object is achieved by a tape dispenser according to claim 1. As a result the tape is dispensed onto the surface laterally adjacent
said salient.The means to mount the reel of tape may comprise reel engagement
means adapted to engage with the inwardly facing surface of a reel of tape to
guide the reel of tape for rotation about the central axis of the reel of tape.The body may comprise a hollow, relatively thin walled box within
which said reel of tape may be mounted.The body may comprise a base part and a lid part releasably secured
together. The resilient biasing means may comprise a plurality of leaf springs
anchored at one end to the body and
the leaf springs each comprise a tongue which is free from the body except at one end where
it is integral with the body.The tapered guide means may comprise a tapered roller rotatable
about an axis which extends away from the engagement portion and over which
the tape is passed.The body may be provided with two sets of said guide means and
guide surface at opposite ends of the body so that the tape may be dispensed,
alternately, from opposite ends of the body.An example of the invention will now be described with reference to
the accompanying drawings, wherein:
FIGURE 1 is a side view of a tape dispenser embodying the invention;FIGURE 2 is a view of a base part of the dispenser of Figure 1

<CLAIMS>
A tape dispenser (10) comprising a body (20) having a first
engagement portion (43) to engage a salient standing above a surface, a second

engagement portion (32) at least part of which is adapted to engage said surface
and extending perpendicularly away from the first engagement portion (43), reel

mounting means (38) to mount a reel of tape (41) for rotation relative to the
body (20), guide means (50) to guide the tape so as to be dispensed from the

body (20) laterally adjacent to the first engagement portion (43), at least one
resilient biasing means (44) to engage the reel of tape (41) and resiliently bias the

reel of tape towards the first engagement portion (43) and bias the reel of tape
into engagement with an abutment means which is laterally adjacent the first

engagement portion (43); the first engagement portion (43) comprising an
outwardly facing surface of a wall (70) of the body (20), the abutment means

comprising an inwardly facing surface (71) of said wall (70) of the body 20), the
second engagement portion (32) being provided by an edge wall of the body (20), and the tape

being dispensed from the body (20) through an opening (60) in said second
engagement portion (32); the dispenser (10) further comprising

a guide surface (79) being
disposed laterally adjacent to the first engagement portion (43) and facing in a

direction opposite to a direction in which the first engagement portion (43) faces
and being located in the tape discharge path adjacent the opening (60); the guide

surface (79) comprising a portion of said abutment means, said guide surface
(79) being tapered and having an outer end of said guide surface (79) spaced

laterally closer to the first engagement portion (43) than an inner end of said
guide surface (79);

   characterised in that
the tape discharge path extends from the reel of tape (41) to the opening (60) via the

guide means (50), in that
the guide means (50) is disposed within the body 

and in use, guides the tape so as to be dispensed from the body (20) through the
opening (60), in that the guide means (50) is disposed adjacent the guide surface (79)

and is tapered to urge the tape towards the first engagement portion (43) as 
the tape is dispensed, and in that the guide surface (79) is adapted to engage an edge of

the tape as the tape is dispensed.
A dispenser (10) according to claim 1 wherein the means (38) to
mount the reel of tape comprises reel engagement means adapted to engage with

the inwardly facing surface (40) of a reel of tape (41) to guide the reel of tape
(41) for rotation about the central axis (42) of the reel of tape (41).
A dispenser (10) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein
the body (20) comprises a hollow, relatively thin walled box (21, 22) within which

said reel of tape (41) is mounted.
A dispenser (10) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein
the body (20) comprises a base part (21) and a lid part (22) releasably secured

together.
A dispenser (10) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein
the resilient biasing means (44) comprises a plurality of leaf springs anchored at

one end (45) to the body and the leaf springs each comprise a tongue which is
free from the body except at one end (45) where it is integral with the body.
A dispenser (10) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein
the tapered guide means (50) comprises a tapered roller rotatable about an axis

(X-X) which extends away from the first engagement portion (43) and over which
the tape is passed.
A dispenser (10) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein
the body (20) is provided with two sets of said guide means (50) and guide

surface (79) at opposite ends of the body (20) so that the tape may be dispensed,
alternately, from opposite ends of the body (20).
