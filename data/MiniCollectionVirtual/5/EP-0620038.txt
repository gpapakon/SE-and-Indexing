<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst 1 is provided in a gas passage 4 for communicating between a 
gas flow-in unit 12 and a gas flow-out unit 13, and the catalyst 1 is heated 

by a heater 2, and a temperature sensor 3 for detecting the temperature of 
the heater 2 is provided inside the heater 2. By feeding power to the heater 

2, the wall temperature of the heater 2 is raised to heat the catalyst 1, and 
then malodorous gas containing odor substances is passed in from the gas flow-in 

unit 12. The malodorous gas passes through the catalyst 1 in the gas 
passage 4 to be oxidized to be harmless and odorless, and is discharged from 

the gas flow-out unit 13.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a deodorizing apparatus for oxidizing 
malodorous gas by using catalyst to make harmless and odorless. The deodorizing apparatus for oxidizing malodorous gas generated when 
drying and treating refuse such as domestic kitchen waste to make harmless 
and odorless has been widely realized recently. The catalyst used in such deodorizing apparatus includes noble metals 
such as platinum and palladium, heavy metal compounds such as manganese, and 
compound oxides such as perovskite, which are used by processing into pellets, 
mat, net, honeycomb or the like, and when handling reaction products in gas 
form, the honeycomb type is widely used because of its low ventilation 
resistance and large mechanical strength. These catalysts are low in reactivity at ordinary temperature, and in 
order to enhance the reactivity of catalysts, the malodorous gas temperature 
or catalyst temperature must be raised over 200°C. As the constitution of  
 
the heater for heating the catalyst, generally, the circumference of the 
exhaust passage carrying the honeycomb catalyst or the like was heated by the 
heater from outside, or the malodorous gas was preliminarily heated before 
feeding into the catalyst. When the temperature of the malodorous gas getting into the catalyst is 
low, it is required to enhance the insulation performance in a simple 
constitution in order to heat the malodorous gas near the catalyst or the 
catalyst itself to over 200°C so as to obtain a favorable reactivity. To heat the malodorous gas near the catalyst or the catalyst itself to 
high temperature, the wall temperature of the heater must be raised, and in 
particular since there is a close correlation between the wall temperature 
and life of the heater, the wall temperature of the heater must be detected 
at high precision in order to extend the life. Moreover, when the deodorizing apparatus is used in the indoor refuse 
treating system, a perfect odor enclosure is required aside from safety. By 
reducing the pressure loss at the catalyst, the reactivity of the catalyst 
must be enhanced. It is hence a first object of the invention to present a deodorizing  
 
apparatus of excellent insulating performance and low pressure loss, and 
capable of holding a catalyst in a simple constitution, and also a deodorizing 
apparatus extended in the life of heater and capable of controlling the 
temperature accurately. To achieve the above object, the invention comprises a gas flow-in unit, 
a gas flow-out unit, a gas passage
