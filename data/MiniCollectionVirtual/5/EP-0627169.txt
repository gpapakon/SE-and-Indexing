<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
evaporated milk with a high heat and storage stability. Evaporated milk, hereinafter also referred to as 'evap', 
is prepared by standardizing milk to a desired fat:non-fat 
solids ratio, keeping this milk at a high temperature for a 
specified time, the so-called preheat, and subsequently 
concentrating it to the desired solids content by means of 
evaporating water in vacuum. This product acquires a long 
storage life (1-2 years) by sterilizing it after packaging in 
can or bottle or by first sterilizing the product in 
throughflow and then aseptically packaging it. Because of the 
heating steps, evap has a brownish color. Sterilization alone is not sufficient to achieve a long 
storage life of a fat-containing evap. In addition, it is 
necessary to reduce the emulsion particles to prevent 
separation of the fat fraction. This reduction of emulsion 
particles arises during homogenization. It is therefore 
conventional to homogenize the concentrated liquid product 
subsequently to the evaporation step. Because homogenization 
after the evaporation step gives a product with a low heat 
stability, i.e., a product that curdles during sterilization, 
stabilization salts, such as Na2HPO4, are added to render the 
product suitable for sterilization. It is necessary to 
determine the optimum amount of stabilization salts for each 
batch of evap to be produced because the reaction of evap to 
the (phosphate) addition varies from one batch to another due 
to natural variation. This is done by means of a so-called 
test sterilization. This test sterilization is a time-consuming 
step which slows down the progression of the 
complete process to a considerable extent. There is accordingly a need in this branch of the art 
to prepare evap with a high heat stability and an excellent 
storage stability through a simpler and more economical 
process.  
 The literature - for an overview, see, for instance, the 
article by H. Singh, L.K. Creamer & D.F. Newstead, Bulletin of 
the IDF N° 238/1989, pp. 94-104 - in addition to mentioning 
the stabilization techniques already in use, such as 
preheating before evaporation at 120 °C, two-stage 
homogenization after evaporation and phosphate addition before 
sterilization, also mentions the use of additives which are 
not allowed by food law, such as formaldehyde, H2O2, or lye, 
and of expensive and complicated processes to remove serum 
proteins or salts. As regards the order in which the process steps that
