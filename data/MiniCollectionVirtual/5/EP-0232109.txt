<ABSTRACT>
A panel (10) for a concrete forming structure 
includes two siderails (12) and two end rails (14) extending 

between and connecting the ends of the siderails. A 
corrugated, aluminum core member (32) is located inside 

the area formed by the rails and substantially covers 
the interior space of the panel. An outer structural 

sheet (22) extends between the two sets of rails and has 
the core member connected thereto. An inner plywood 

sheet (24) extends between the two sets of rails and is 
attached thereto. The core member is also connected 

to the plywood sheet. Rigid insulating material (40) 
fills the inner and outer troughs formed by the 

corrugated member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modular panels for 
concrete forming structure and connecting members 
therefor. In the past, the cost of the formwork needed 
to erect a poured concrete structure has averaged 
approximately 50% of the total cost of the concrete 
structure and one reason for this substantial cost is 
that the erection of the formwork is labour 
intensive. Because the cost of labour is high, there 
is a need for better, more efficient forming systems 
in order to increase productivity and to reduce the 
amount of time required to erect formwork. Various 
attempts have been made in the past to provide a 
modular forming system that is relatively easy to 
erect and that is not prohibitively expensive to 
produce. Some of the modular panels for concrete 
formwork in the past have a sheet of plywood or metal 
that faces the concrete to be poured, which sheet is 
supported by transverse metal bars or frame members 
attached to a generally rectangular frame that 
extends around the perimeter of the panel. Various 
devices are provided for connecting such panels in a 
rigid edge-to-edge relationship to create the  
 
formwork. One difficulty with these known panels is 
that they tend to be quite heavy due to the fact that 
the plywood thickness for such a panel is from 15.875mm (5/8") 
to 17.4625mm (11/16") and the transverse and peripheral frame 
members can also have a substantial weight, whether 
made from wood or metal. It will be appreciated that the ideal 
modular panel for a concrete forming system should 
have the greatest possible strength to weight ratio. 
The panel must have sufficient strength to resist the 
pressure of the fresh concrete and to prevent bulges 
in the concrete and they should also be sufficiently 
strong to withstand the rough handling that they may 
receive on a construction site. In addition, because 
these panels are repeatedly assembled, then 
disassembled, and then moved from one construction 
site to another for reuse, the smaller the weight of 
each panel the easier it is to work with. If the 
weight of the panel is kept to less than 45.36 kg (100 pounds), 
it may be possible to handle and transport the panel 
by manual labour. Large panels and panels having a 
weight of 45.36 kg (100 pounds) or more may necessitate the use 
of a crane for handling and transport.  
 Another difficulty with known panels for 
formwork is that they are either not suitable for or 
are costly to use in cold climatic conditions. If no 
provision is made in the panel for keeping the inside
