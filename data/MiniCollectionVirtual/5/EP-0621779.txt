<CLAIMS>
Use of indomethacin lysinate for the preparation of a sterile
pharmaceutical composition intended for therapeutic use in ophthalmology, said

indomethacin lysinate deriving from salification of the carboxylic function by the
amino group of an amino acid, wherein said indomethacin lysinate penetrates the

tissues and the humours of the eye, in the form of an aqueous isotonic solution and
having a neutral or approximately neutral pH, or in the form of a suspension, a gel

or an emulsion containing other ions, said indomethacin lysinate being present in
said solution, suspension, gel or emulsion as the single active ingredient in the

form of a salt isolated in its pure state and without any residual solvent except, if
appropriate, traces of ethanol.
Use according to claim 1 for the treatment of inflammatory manifestations
that may be associated with surgical procedures carried out on cataracts and the

anterior segment of the eye, for the prevention of aphakic cystoid macular oedema
occurring after surgical extraction of the crystalline lens.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
, in the aqueous
isotonic solution, the ions are buffers containing NaH
2
PO
4
, Na
2
HPO
4
 or NaCl.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
, in the gel,
the gelling mixture is carboxypolymethylene, sodium mercurothiolate, mannitol,

sodium hydroxide and water.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the
indomethacin lysinate is obtained by reacting the carboxylic function with the

amino function in a hydroethanol medium, in the absence of any other organic
solvent leading to a final product without any residual solvent other than ethanol. 
Use according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the salt isolated in its pure
state is sterilised either in its pure state or in an aqueous solution, for example by

autoclaving or by membrane filtration.
