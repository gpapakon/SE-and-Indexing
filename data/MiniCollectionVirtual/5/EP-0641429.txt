<ABSTRACT>
Measuring chamber for flow cytometer for the measuring of fluorescent and scattered light of individual cells or other microscopic particles, comprising: a body (2) with a flat surface (6), an inlet chamber (8) and an outlet chamber (10) within the body (2), which open on the surface (6), the chambers being positioned one in front of the other and being connected by a channel (12), the chamber (8) being equipped with an inlet tube (14) and an injection tube (16) and the chamber (10) being equipped with an outlet tube (18), a transparent plate (20) placed in front of the surface (6), and moveable from a first position detached from the surface to a second position in which the plate closes to seal the chambers (8, 10) and the channel (12), with optical means placed in front of the plate to direct light on a particle placed in the channel (12) and to receive fluorescent light emitted from the same particle, characterized by the fact that the axis of the tube (16) intersects the optical axis (30) of the optical means at a point outside the channel whereby a liquid and particles, injected into the chamber throughout the tube (14) and the tube (16) respectively, flow with laminal flow through the channel (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 "MEASURING CHAMBER FOR FLOW CYTOMETER"The present invention refers to a measuring chamber for a flow cytometer to measure the fluorescent and 5 scattered light of individual cells or microscopic particles, comprising: a body with a flat surface, an inlet chamber and an outlet chamber within the body, which open on the flat surface, the chambers being positioned one in front of the other and being connected10 by a channel in the body, the inlet chamber being equipped with an inlet tube and an injection tube and the outlet chamber being equipped with an outlet tube, a transparent plate placed in front of the flat surface, the plate being moveable from a first position detached3.5 from the flat surface to a second position in which the plate closes to seal the chambers and the channel, optical means placed in front of the transparent plate to direct light on the particle contained in the channel and receive fluorescent light emitted from the same20 particle.In a flow cytometer, some biological cells or other types of microscopic particles are carried by a laminal flow of a liquid, like water, through the focus of an intense, luminous source. The fluorescent and scattered25 light emitted from each single cell when it passes through the focus are collected by suitable optical means and are directed onto proper light detectors.The scattered light, obtained in this way, supplies 

information on the size and structure of the cell, while the fluorescent light is a measure of the contents of the cell, which had been previously colored with a fluorescent coloring substance which is bound to it in a particular manner.To obtain the highest level of excitation possible at the focus and, consequently, the maximum sensitivity, the light is concentrated in a very small focus, usually with a length around 100 micrometers. The cells must follow the same route through the focus in order that they can be analyzed in a reproducable manner. To obtain this, the principle of "hydrodynamic focussing" is used (P.J. Crossland-Taylor, Nature, Volume 171, Pgs. 37-38, 1953). Hydrodynamic focussing is obtained in a cone nozzle, filled with water. The water, which is pumped in the nozzle, flows with laminal flow toward an opening at the pointed tip of the nozzle so as to form a lamina jet with a typical velocity of a few meters per second. The sample, that is, the suspension of the cells to be analyzed, is injected in the nozzle through a thin tube which has one of its end openings at or very close to the axis of the nozzle. Since
