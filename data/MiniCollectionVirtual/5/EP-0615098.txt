Device for the separation of particles, in particular oil or grease 
particles, from an air stream passing through the dev
ice, consisting of 

a number of lamellae (1, 2) in each case essentially U-shaped in cross-section, 
which are arranged in two opposed rows in each case at 

intervals parallel and adjacent to each other, 
wherein the lamellae (1, 2) of the two rows are arranged with their 
concave cavities facing towards each other and offset from each other 

in such a way that the edges of two adjacent lamellae (1, 2) of one 
row are located opposite the concave cavity of a lamella (1, 2) of the 

other row, 
the lamellae (1, 2) of one row are formed from a metal plate, and 
that the metal plates of the two rows are set at a distance from each 
other which corresponds to the total height (H) of the device, 
 
characterised in that 


each lamella (1, 2) as seen in cross-section is composed of: 

in its central region an arcuate piece extending over 120 to 130 , with 
a radius (R) which is about 3/4 of the total height (H), 
in their edge regions adjoining the central region on both sides, in each 
case longitudinal edges (1a, 2a) bent parallel to each other, of which 

the height (h) is 3/20 to 6/20 of the total height (H), and 
the inside width of an inlet channel (W) formed by the longitudinal 
edges of two adjacent lamellae of one row is about 3/4 of the total 

height (H). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that at least one of the 
facing concave cavities of the lamellae (1, 2) is provided with a 

structured surface. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the structured 
surface forms projections and depressions. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the projections and 
depressions are formed from the material of the lamellae (1, 2). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the edges of a metal 
plate are in each case bent at 90 .  

 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the end and 
longitudinal edges bent at 90 are shaped in such a way that the metal 

plates can be nested one inside the other. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the metal plates in 
the region of their edges are held together by a frame which receives the 

end and longitudinal edges of the metal plates. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the metal plate 
which is the lower one in the fitted position at one edge transversely to 

the lamellae (1, 2) is provided with projections (21) arranged at intervals 
and projecting towards the outer side of the device and serving to rest on 

a support. 
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that the projections (21) 
arranged at intervals on the lower metal plate are formed from the metal 

plate. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that in the lower metal 
plate at least at its lower edge in the fitted position transversely to the 

lamellae at intervals are arranged openings (20). 
Device according to claims 5 and 10, characterised in that the 
openings (20) arranged at intervals in the lower metal plate are located 

after the bend at 90 precisely on the edge formed thereby. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal 
edges adjoining the central region of each lamella (1, 2) in cross-section 

on both sides are in each case bent parallel to the axis of symmetry of 
the arcuate piece extending over 120 to 130.
