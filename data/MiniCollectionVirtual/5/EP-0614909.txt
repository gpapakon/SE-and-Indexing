<ABSTRACT>
In a method for selectively acylating the phenolic 
hydroxyl group at the 3-position of estradiol with an N-bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamoyl 

halogenide, an ultra-strong 
base is used as acid acceptor. By this method, it is 

possible to acylate the phenolic hydroxyl group at the 3-position 
of estradiol with hardly any side reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for selective
acylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group at the
3-position of estradiol.As acylation methods of the phenolic hydroxyl
groups of steroids, there have hitherto been known methods
using an inorganic alkali, a trialkylamine compound
and a pyridine compound, respectively, as an acid acceptor
in an inert solvent, and for example, it is proposed
in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 17, 583 (1978) and EP
138,153 to use a pyridine compound selected from 4-(tertiary
amino)pyridines. However, when such a known catalyst
is used, hydrolysis of the reactant(s) and the
product and side reactions are unavoidable, or when a
strong base such as a trialkylamine compound is used as a
catalyst, it often occurs that reaction does not progress
at all, or if the reaction progresses, it is hard to
selectively acylate only the objective phenolic hydroxyl
group at the 3-position of the steroid, and there is a
possibility that various complicated by-products are
formed.Further when a 4-(tertiary amino)pyridine
proposed as above is used, there arises mixing of a large
amount of the catalyst pyridine and its salt into the
desired product after the acylation, and it is hard to
isolate and purify the desired compound, and when the
product is subjected to further treatments, it is seriously
badly influenced due to the impurities, resulting
in lowering of the yield. These are as described in GB
1,523,035. Thus, the object of this invention lies in
providing a method for carrying out the acylation more
efficiently.The present inventors had carried out
research on a method for solving such problems and 
for consistently acylating the phenolic hydroxyl group at the 3-position
of estradiol, and as a result they found, unexpectedly,
that when the ultra-strong base DBN or DBU or a mixture thereof is used as the
acid acceptor in the above acylation, it is possible to
make the acylation reaction progress conveniently with
little occurrence of side reactions.Thus the above object can be attained by a
method according to this invention, namely in a method
for selective acylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group at
the 3-position of estradiol which comprises reacting
estradiol with an N-bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamoyl halogenide
in an inert solvent in the presence of an acid
acceptor, wherein the improvement comprises using one of the above
ultra-strong bases as the acid acceptor.As the inert solvent according to this invention,
there is used an aromatic hydrocarbon such as
toluene or xylene; or a chlorinated
