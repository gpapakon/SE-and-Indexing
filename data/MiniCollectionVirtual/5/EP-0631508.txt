Suction catheter for sucking from the tracheobronchial 
system of a patient, comprising a flexible catheter tube 

(10) with a proximal end (11) and a distal end (12) and at 
least one through lumen (13) as well as ventilation 

openings (15) formed in a distal end area of the catheter 
tube, said openings leading into the lumen, this distal 

end area includes a thickened area located between the 
ventilation openings and the distal end of the catheter 

tube, characeterized in that the thickened area has the 
shape of a piston (10a) with a cylindrical outside wall 

and proximal and distal transition zones (17,18) adjacent 
to the central cylindrical outside wall and for suction 

catheter sizes from 8 CH to 18 CH the outer diameter DK of 
the piston is between 2,7 and 6,1 mm and the central 

cylindrical outside wall has a predetermined length (a) 
between approximately 2 mm and 8 mm, especially 3 to 5 mm 

and with the length (a) of the central cylindrical outside 
wall being such as to permit areal guidance and fitting of 

the suction catheter by this thickened area when it is 
introduced into the tracheobronchial system of a patient 

and the ventilation openings (15) formed adjacent outside 
wall are positioned at a predetermined distance (Lf) 

starting from the axis of the ventilation openings to the 
distal end (12) of the catheter tube of approximately 6 to 

16 mm. 
Suction catheter according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the predetermined length (a) of the central 

cylindrical outside wall is roughly the same as diameter 
(DK) of the thickened area of the distal end area.
 
Suction catheter according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the length (a) of the central cylindrical outside  

 
wall is at least twice the diameter (DI) of the lumen 

(13). 
Suction catheter according to one of the claims 1 to 3 
being connectable at the proximal end with a connector or 

the like and whereby the lumen is provided at the distal 
end of the catheter tube with a distal outlet opening of 

the lumen being enlarged with respect to the cross section 
of the lumen, characterized in that the lumen (13) is 

expanded in the shape of a funnel (21a) toward the distal 
end of catheter tube (10) of the suction catheter, whereby 

the funnel, beginning at the distal end (12), has a depth 
(t) of approximately 2 to 4 mm. 
Suction catheter according to one of the claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that, in order to establish the sizes of 

the suction catheter, measured in CH (Charr) according to 
the ISO standard, the outside diameter DK of cylindrical 

piston (10a) of the thickened area of catheter tube (10) 
forming the suction catheter is used in conjunction with 

the diameter DI of through lumen (13) used for suction and 
catheter tube (10) abutting it up to proximal end (11) of 

the suction catheter has an outside diameter (DR) that is 
reduced relative to outside diameter (DK) of cylindrical 

piston (10a). 
Suction catheter according to claims 1 to 3 characterized 
in that the difference between the wall thickness (SK) of 

cylindrical piston (10a) and the wall thickness (SR) of 
catheter tube (10) is between 0.4 and 0.6 mm at catheter 

sizes of 8 to 18 CH. 
Suction catheter according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterized in that wall thickness (SK) of cylindrical 

piston (10a) is between 0.7 and 1,5 mm at suction catheter 
sizes from 8 CH to 18 CH and wall thickness (SR) of 

catheter tube (10) is between 0.3 and 0.9 mm.  
 
Suction catheter according to one of claims 1 to 7 
characterized in that a space (f1) of 2 to 3 mm is 

provided between cylindrical piston (10a), including 
transition zone (17), and the axis of the ventilation 

openings (15) in the distal end area of suction catheter 
(1). 
Suction catheter according to one of claims 1 to 8 
characterized in that transition zones (17, 18) of 

cylindrical piston (10a) run at a shallow angle (α, β) of 
about 10° to 20° to both sides. 
Suction catheter according to one of claims 1 to 9 
characterized in that the total length (Lf) of the distal 

end area with thickened area (10a, 17, 18) is made the 
same length from ventilation openings (15) to distal end 

(12) for suction catheters of sizes 8 CH to 18 CH and is 
in the range from about 8 to 12 mm. 
Suction catheter according to one of the claims 1 to 10 
characterized in that the lumen is expanded toward the 

distal end by at least two axially extended notches (22, 
23) uniformly distributed over the circumference, said 

notches departing from distal end (12) and impressed into 
the wall of the catheter tube (10) delimiting the funnel 

(21a) and possibly lumen (13). 
Suction catheter according to claim 11 characterized in 
that the notches (22, 23) have an axial length (d2) of 

approximately 2 to 4 mm and a width (d3) less than the 
diameter of the lumen, especially approximately 1/7 to 1/4 

of the lumen diameter.
