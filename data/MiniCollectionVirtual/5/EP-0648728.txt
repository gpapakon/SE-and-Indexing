<ABSTRACT>
An alkene stream which contains an alkane as an impurity is introduced into a 
reactor A and is hydrated therein in the presence of a hydration catalyst to 

produce a product stream including an alcohol. The alcohol is separated from 
unreacted alkene and alkane in a heat exchanger B and a product recovery unit 

C. The process additionally utilises an adsorptive separate D to separate alkene 
from the alkane impurity. The alkene is desorbed from the adsorbent and 

passed to the reactor A. The alkene adsorption unit D may receive feed solely 
from the heat exchanger B and unit C (Figure 1) or may additionally receive as 

feed all the fresh alkane and alkene entering the process (Figure 2). The alkene 
and alk
ane either both have two carbon atoms, in which case the product is 
ethanol, or both have three carbon atoms, the alkene being propylene, in which 

case the product is isopropanol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for producing alcohols by the 
direct hydration of alkenes, and more particularly to a process in which ethanol 
or isopropanol is produced by contacting an ethene stream containing ethane as 
an impurity or a propene stream containing propane as an impurity with water in 
the presence of an appropriate hydration catalyst. Ethanol and isopropanol are produced commercially by the direct hydration of 
ethene or propene, respectively, in the liquid or vapour phase over a suitable 
catalyst. The reaction can be carried out in any suitable reactor and it produces 
the desired alcohol product and generally small amounts of byproducts, such as 
diethyl ether, in the case of ethanol production and diisopropyl ether, in the case 
of isopropanol production. The reaction conversion is usually less than 100%; 
accordingly the reactor effluent also generally contains unreacted ethene or 
propene. Furthermore, chemical grade ethene and propene usually contains 
small amounts of ethane and/or propane. Therefore, since ethane and propane 
are not generally affected by ethene and propene direct hydration catalysts, the 
reactor effluent contains ethane and/or propane. To enhance selectivity to the desired product the hydration reaction is generally 
carried out at a hydrocarbon conversion per pass somewhat lower than 100% 
(as low as 5% for ethene hydration and generally about 60 to 75% for propene 
hydration). Accordingly, to improve efficiency, the above processes are 
generally carried out as recycle processes in which part of the gaseous effluent 
is recycled to the direct hydration reactor after recovery of the desired alcohol 
product. However, since ethane and propane are not affected in the direct 
hydration reaction, these components tend to build up in recycle hydration 
reaction systems, unless steps are taken to eliminate them from the system. The removal of ethane or propane from a gas stream containing the  
 
corresponding alkene, i.e. ethene or propene, respectively, is complicated 
because of the difficulty of separating the alkene from the corresponding alkane. 
Fractional distillation is an effective method of separating these components. 
However, the alkene and corresponding alkane have volatility characteristics so 
similar that the cost of separating the alkene from the corresponding alkane by 
distillation is prohibitively high. Due to the difficulty of separating ethene and propene from the corresponding 
alkanes, the buildup of ethane and propane

A process for the production of an alcohol comprising the steps of: 

(a) contacting an alkane-alkene mixture and water with a hydration 
catalyst in a reaction zone under conditions which result in the 

production of a gaseous product containing alcohol, unreacted 
alkene and alkane; 
(b) recovering said alcohol from said gaseous product; 
(c) selectively adsorbing alkene from the substantially alcohol-free 
gaseous product by passing at least part of the substantially 

alcohol-free gaseous product through an adsorption zone containing 
an adsorbent which selectively adsorbs the alkene; 
(d) regenerating said adsorbent, thereby producing an alkene-enriched 
gas stream; and 
(e) recycling said alkene-enriched gas stream to said reaction zone, 
 
wherein both the alkene and alkane have either two carbon atoms, and 

the alcohol is ethanol, or three carbon atoms, the alkene being propylene, 
and the alcohol is isopropanol.
