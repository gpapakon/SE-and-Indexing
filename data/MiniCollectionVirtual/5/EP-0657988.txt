<ABSTRACT>
A control system includes a programmable 
microprocessor (13) in bus communication with memory 

units (10) and a plurality of motor drivers (550), each 
of the motor drivers being in electrical communication 

with a respective motor (552) for controlling the 
operation of the respective motor in response to data 

from the microprocessor (13). The microprocessor data 
includes PWM control data and clock data. Data registers 

(497) are in communication with the data bus (18) for 
reading and writing of PWM control data to and from the 

data registers (497). A programmable clock (498) is 
provided for reading the clock data and producing a 

plurality of independent clock pulses in response to the 
clock data. An address decoder is responsive to an 

address on the address bus (17) for enabling the 
programmable clock (498) for programming and for 

enabling others registers for writing of the PWM data to 
the data registers. A multi-stage PWM generator (499) is 

provided having a plurality of independent PWM stages. 
Each of the PWM stages is in electrical communication 

with a respective motor driver (550), and each PWM stage, 
generating an independent PWM signal responsive to the 

PWM data and a clock pulse.

08/163,629, entitled CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE 
METER HAVING A PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED 
CIRCUIT. The disclosure of these European applications are hereby 
incorporated herein by reference. In machine control systems of the type employed in 
electronic postage meters (EPM) , it is conventional to 
design a specific EPM control system for each meter 
model. As part of that control system, it is 
conventional to design a microprocessor based controller 
for each machine model because of variations in the  
 
system operating speed and number of machine motors 
utilized. The conventional architecture of such control 
systems includes a microprocessor based control system 
having a microprocessor in bus communication with a 
plurality of memory units and applications specific 
integrated circuit (ASIC). As part of the ASIC 
circuitry, it is known to include a pulse width 
modulation (PWM) circuit which is specifically 
parameterized to interface with the particular motors 
employed in the EPM model. It is an objective of the present
