<ABSTRACT>
In the synthesis of simvastatin by direct methylation of lovastatin, selective hydrolysis of residual lovastatin, lovastatin acid or a salt thereof by treatment with a bacterium or fungus capable of hydrolyzing the 2-methyl-butyryloxy side chain or a mutant of such microbe or a cell-free extract derived therefrom, or a hydrolase derived therefrom yields 7-[1',2',6',7',8',8a'(R)-hexahydro-2'(S),6'(R)-dimethyl-8'(S)-hydroxy- 1'(S)naphthyl]-3(R),5(R)-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid, the triol acid, or triol salt which can be easily separated from simvastatin, either before or after lactonization to the lactone form. This process produces simvastatin of high yield and purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
biosynthetic conversion of lovastatin to
7-[1',2',6',7',8',8a'(R)-hexahydro-2'(S),6'(R)-dimethyl-8'(S)-hydroxy-1'(S)-naphthyl]-3(R),5(R)-dihydroxyheptanoic
acid, "triol acid" by microbiological
hydrolysis in the synthesis of simvastatin from
lovastatin to facilitate the separation and isolation
of simvastatin from unreacted lovastatin starting
material. The process employs a bacterium or fungus
capable of hydrolyzing the 2-methylbutyryloxy side
chain of lovastatin, or a mutant of such a microbe or
a hydrolase derived therefrom.The triol acid and its lactone form are
known in the art and are inhibitors of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol
biosynthesis. The selective conversion of lovastatin salt
to the triol salt is useful for the separation of
simvastatin from unreacted lovastatin in the
production of simvastatin from lovastatin.
Lovastatin acid has a 2-methylbutyryloxy side chain
in the 8'-position and is difficult to separate from
the newly formed simvastatin acid which has a
2,2-dimethyl-butyryloxy side chain at the
8'-position. Applicants have now found that
selective cleavage of the 2-methylbutyryloxy side
chain from lovastatin acid salt using the process of
this invention employing a hydrolase enzyme from a
microbe including fungi such as Clonostachyscompactiuscula (ATCC 38009 and ATCC 74178), Monascusruber, Mortierellaisabellina, Emericellaunguis,
Diheterosporachlamydosporia, Humicolafuscoatra,
Dichotomomycescejpii, Neocosmosporaafricana,
Xylogonesphaerospora, Torulomycesragena, Thielaviafimeti, Aspergillusunguis, Mucorcircinelloides,
Fusariumsolani, Penicilliumchrysogenum, Aspergillusclavatus, Scopulariopsiscommunis, Gilmaniellahumicola, Mucorbainieri, Tricharusspiralis, and
Chaetomiumcochliodes, or bacteria, especially an
actinomycete such as Streptomycesalbogriscolus,
Streptomycespaucisporogenes, Streptomyceshygroscopius, Streptomycesviridochromogenes,
Planomonosporaparontospora, and Kibdelosporangiumaridum to yield the triol salt results in a more
easily separable mixture and greater purity of the
simvastatin product. The present invention is in the field of
inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase which are useful as
antihypercholesterolemic agents. It is now well
established that hypercholesterolemia is a
significant risk factor in the development of
cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis.
Compounds which are able to inhibit the HMG-CoA
reductase enzyme interfere with and limit the
biosynthesis
