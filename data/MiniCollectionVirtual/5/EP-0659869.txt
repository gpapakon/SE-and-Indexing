<ABSTRACT>
A method for removing mercury from a liquid 
hydrocarbon fraction, said hydrocarbon fraction optionally 

also comprising water and/or a component having a higher 
molecular weight than the desired hydrocarbon compound, 

said method comprising: 

(a) removing any higher molecular weight 
component and any water from said fraction, and 
(b) removing mercury from said fraction by 
contacting the fraction with an adsorbent in the form of 

active carbon having at least one of calcium and a calcium 
compound supported thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for removing
mercury from a hydrocarbon fraction which contains an organic mercury compound and more particularly,
to a method for high efficient removing mercury from a
hydrocarbon fraction which contains a small amount of
mercury and can be handled in a liquid state on a
commercial scale (to be referred to as "liquid hydrocarbon
fraction" hereinafter) .In the prior art, mercury removal techniques were
developed and established as one of pollution control
measures in order to remove toxic mercury from waste water
and exhausted gases. A variety of techniques were
available in the prior art for removing mercury from water
and gases.Palladium supported on alumina and similar catalysts
are often used in reforming a petroleum fraction or similar
liquid hydrocarbon fraction through hydrogenation or the
like. It is known that, if mercury is present in the
hydrocarbon fraction as an incidental impurity, the
catalyst is poisoned such that modification may not fully
take place. For removal of mercury from a liquid hydrocarbon
fraction, for example, Japanese Patent Application Kokai
(JP-A) No. 90502/1977 discloses a method for removing
mercury from vacuum pump oil by adding zinc sulfide to the
oil, allowing the zinc sulfide to adsorb and collect
mercury, and thereafter separating the mercury along with
the excess zinc sulfide. JP-A 28295/1991 discloses use of
an adsorbent in the form of active carbon having cupric
chloride or stannous chloride supported thereon. JP-A
213144/1991 discloses use of an adsorbent in the form of
active carbon having supported thereon halides of metal
elements of Group I or II in the Periodic Table.However, the method of JP-A 90502/1977 results in a
vacuum pump oil having a mercury concentration of about 5
to 3 parts by weight per million parts by volume. This
mercury removal is still insufficient. The method of JP-A
28295/1991 can be applied to only a limited range of
hydrocarbon compounds. For fearing that copper acetilide
might be formed, it is dangerous to use cupric chloride in
treating a hydrocarbon probably containing acetylene .
Stannous chloride to be supported on active carbon has a
low solubility in water and requires to add hydrochloric
acid in order that it be applied or deposited to active
carbon. It is difficult to remove the hydrochloric acid.
As a result, the range of hydrocarbons to which this method
is applicable is limited. The method of JP-A 213144/1991
has the problem that an organic mercury compound in the
liquid hydrocarbon
