<ABSTRACT>
A numeric controller capable of easily machining a part of a prototype product, etc., without considering the coordinates 
system, the origin, etc. Guidance function execution means (1) displays guidance information on a display (16). The operator inputs 

machining command through the use of a keyboard (17), etc., in accordance with this guidance information. Pulse distribution 
means (2) sends the current position (XP, YP, ZP) from current position registers (3, 4, 5) of the pulse distribution means (2) 

to the guidance function execution means (1). The guidance function execution means (1) calculates movement instruction from 
the values specified by the operator and the current position (XP, YP, ZP) and sends it to the pulse distribution means (2). The 

pulse distribution means (2) outputs the distribution pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical control apparatus for
controlling a machine tool, and more particularly to a numerical control apparatus for
controlling a machine tool which machines prototypes or the like.Advances in the technology of numerically controlled machine tools
have been so great that they can machine workpieces of complex shape at high speed
with precision. At present, workpieces of complex shape cannot be machined without
numerically controlled machine tools.To generate machining programs, there are widely used interactive
numerical control apparatus which comprise a numerical control apparatus with an
interactive program generating function, and automatic programming apparatus for
simply generating complex machining programs.In the use of such numerical control apparatus, it is necessary to
accurately define machine coordinates, a machine origin, program coordinates, a
machining origin, and other data for generating strict machining programs. The
interactive numerical control apparatus and the automatic programming apparatus 
can be used to machine a number of workpieces. However, a
portion of a machining process for producing a prototype or
a model is carried out solely at the discretion of the
operator since no definite workpiece shapes are defined.
Therefore, general purpose milling machines, lathes, or the
like are used to machine prototypes or models.Problems of general-purpose machine tools are that the
number of available operators who can handle
general-purpose machine tools is becoming smaller, and it
is difficult for the general-purpose machine tools to carry
out oblique linear machining, arcuate machining, or the
like though they can effect linear machining without any
problem.If, on the other hand, a general numerically
controlled machine tool is used to machine a prototype or
a model, then it is necessary to accurately define machine
coordinates, a machine origin, program coordinates, a
machining origin, and other data. While it is not
impossible to define those data, the required programming
process is too time-consuming and troublesome for machining
a portion of a single workpiece.GB-A-2054199 discloses an NC machine tool with
automatic machining program generation. US-A-4056850
discloses a system for processing incremental position
data.In view of the above problems of the conventional
practice, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a numerical control apparatus capable of easily
carrying out simple machining of a prototype or the like
with a
