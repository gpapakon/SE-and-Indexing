<ABSTRACT>
In a weighing conveyor, a driving roller (2) includes 
an inner cylinder (5) and an outer cylinder (6). The outer 

cylinder (6) is rotatably supported on the inner cylinder 
(5). An endless belt (4) is laid over the outer cylinder. 

An electric motor (17) and a load cell (14) are built in 
the inner cylinder (5). The motor (17) drives the outer 

cylinder through a reduction gear mechanism (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a 
weighing conveyor employed, for instance, in a system for 
weighing and pricing commodities. For instance, a packing facility where commodities for 
supermarkets are packed, may use a weighing and pricing system 
which automatically and continuously performs an operation of 
weighing packed commodities, and an operation of printing 
prices on labels according to the weights of the commodities 
thus weighed and sticking them onto the commodities. The 
weighing and pricing system includes an uptake conveyor for 
introducing commodities, a commodity weighing conveyor, and a 
label sticking conveyor with a label sticking machine above, 
which are continuously arranged. The system operates as 
follows: When a commodity is on the weighing conveyor, its 
weight is measured, and the price of the commodity is 
calculated from the weight thus measured, a predetermined unit 
price, and the packing weight. The price thus calculated and 
the unit price are printed on a label. The label is stuck on 
the commodity when the latter is being moved on the label 
sticking conveyor. The weighing conveyor in the weighing and pricing 
system has been proposed by Japanese Utility Model Unexamined 
Publication No. Sho 60-179933.  
 The weighing conveyor, as shown in FIG. 8, is composed 
of a weighing device 100 and a belt conveyor 101. The belt 
conveyor 101 is designed as follows: A driving roller 104 and 
a driven roller 105 are rotatably supported between a pair of 
side frames 103 and 103 which are coupled to each other through 
coupling members 102. An endless belt 106 is laid over the 
rollers 104 and 105. The driving roller 104 is rotated through 
an endless belt 108 by an electric motor 107 mounted on one of 
the side frames 103, so that the endless belt 106 is run in the 
direction of the arrow (a). A belt supporting board 109 is 
connected between the pair of side frames 103 and 103, to 
support the upper line of the endless belt 106. The side 
frames 103 and 103 are coupled to load inputting members 110 
and 110 protruded from the weighing device 100 located below 
the belt conveyor 101, so that the weight of the belt conveyor 
101 and the weight of a commodity on the belt conveyor 101 are 
applied to the weighing device 100. In the above-described weighing conveyor, the belt 
conveyor, the weighing device, and the belt driving motor are 
provided separately, and the belt conveyor is located above the 
weighing device. Therefore, the weighing conveyor is 
unavoidab

<CLAIMS>
A weighing conveyor comprising: 

conveying means for conveying an article under 
measurement, which includes a plurality of rollers (2,3), 

an endless belt (4) laid over said rollers, and an electric 
motor (17) for driving one (2) of said rollers; and 
load detecting means (14) to which the weight of the whole 
of said conveying means is applied, characterised in that 
at least one (2) of said rollers is of double 
structure having an inner cylinder (5) and an outer 

cylinder (6); 
said load detecting means (14) is accommodated in said 
inner cylinder (5) in such a manner that one end (15a) of 

said load detecting means is coupled to a stationary member 
outside said roller and the other end (15b) is coupled to 

said inner cylinder; 
said outer cylinder (6) is rotatably supported on said 
inner cylinder (5); and 
a frame member (22) provided between said roller of a 
double structure and the remaining roller or rollers is coupled to 

said inner cylinder. 
A weighing conveyor according to claim 1, wherein said 
electric motor (17) is fixedly secured inside said inner 

cylinder (5) of said at least one roller, the conveyor 
further comprising:
 
   rotation transmitting means (18) for rotating said 

outer cylinder (6) with said electric motor, provided 
between said inner cylinder and said outer cylinders. 
A weighing conveyor as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein at least one other of said rollers has a second 

inner cylinder and a second outer cylinder, said second 
outer cylinder being rotatably supported on said second 

inner cylinder. 
A weighing conveyor as claimed in claim 3, when 
dependent on claim 1, wherein said electric motor means 

(17) is accommodated in said second inner cylinder.  
 
A weighing conveyor as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, 
further comprising second load detecting means for 

detecting a weight of said article, said second load 
detecting means being accommodated in said second inner 

cylinder in such a manner that one end of said second load 
detecting means is coupled to a stationary member outside 

said first driven roller and the other end is coupled to 
said second inner cylinder. 
A weighing conveyor as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein said at least one roller is larger in 

diameter than said other roller or rollers.
