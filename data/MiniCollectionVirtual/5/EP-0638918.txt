<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed toward an improved gas 
discharge device. More specifically, the invention is 
directed toward a gas discharge device which uses an 
array of microscopic electron emitters operating under 
the principles of field emission to initiate and sustain 
a discharge. The invention provides a gas discharge 
device with numerous advantages over conventional gas 
discharge devices. The invention can be employed, for 
example, in gas discharge lamps such as fluorescent lamps 
as well as in a wide variety of non-lighting 
applications. A gas discharge requires a source of free electrons 
that can migrate from a cathode to an anode while 
ionizing a background gas and propagating the discharge. 
At the cathode, the electrons are conventionally 
generated by thermionic or secondary emission processes. 
Thermionic emission processes employ a low work function 
material which is raised to a high temperature to 
liberate electrons into the surrounding environment. 
Secondary emission processes employ a material with a 
high secondary electron yield coefficient to liberate 
electrons when the cathode is impacted by ions, other 
electrons, or photons. Thermionic emission cathodes are typically fabricated 
from combinations of rare metals such as barium, 
strontium, scandium and others as the emitter material. 
The combinations of materials are chosen for their low 
work function and low evaporation rate because the former 
determines the temperature that the cathode must be 
raised to and the latter determines the operating life of 
the cathode. The emitter material is heated to extremely 
high temperatures for operation, typically greater than  
 
1000°C. At operating temperatures, the thermal 
distribution of electrons in the emitter material allows 
a significant number of electrons to have a thermal 
kinetic energy greater than the binding energy of the 
material. This renders these electrons effectively free 
of the material and therefore permits these electrons to 
be easily drawn off by an applied external field. The operational characteristics of thermionic 
emission cathodes also dictate their shortcomings. 
First, the cathode must be heated to very high 
temperatures in order to produce a significant number of 
free electrons. This heating requires power which must 
normally be externally applied. In some cases this power 
can be derived from the back-bombardment of the emitter 
in a gas discharge. Second, the emissive material on the 
cathode slowly boils off into its surrounding
