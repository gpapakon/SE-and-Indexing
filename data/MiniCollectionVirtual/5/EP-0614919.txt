<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a latex composition containing 
polymer particles having core/shell structure. More particularly, 
the invention relates to latices containing polymer particles 
obtainable by a sequential aqueous emulsion polymerization of two 
monomer mixtures each comprising vinylesters of tertiary, saturated 
carboxylic acids. Conventional latex compositions are used in particular as 
binder in emulsion paints. When a wet latex film is applied, water 
evaporates allowing the polymer particles to coalesce. The result 
of this physical phenomenon, if the particles are sufficient soft 
to coalesce, is a dry polymer film. The process of film formation 
is very important as it determines the film properties and the 
performance of the final product. The readiness with which the film 
is formed is related to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of 
the polymer and there is a minimum film formation temperature (MFT) 
below which the particles do not coalesce. Ideally, the MFT is low, 
ensuring applicability at both outdoor and indoor temperatures. On 
the other hand, a low Tg results in a tacky film, which is undesirable 
for coatings. Hence, the Tg is should preferably by high, at 
least well above room temperature. The quality of a final film depends on a good balance between 
its rigidity and its flexibility. To guarantee good film formation 
(requiring "soft" particles) combined with a sufficient rigidity, 
three solutions have been proposed: 
the addition to the paint of a few percent of co-solvent 
(coalescing agent). However, these volatile organic products 
can be toxic and contribute to the pollution of the environment.  the use of polymer latices that by proper composure of specific 
monomer mixtures combine a desirable balance of rigidity 
and flexibility at room temperature. However, such latices 
have only found application in specialty coatings as a result 
of their relatively high price. the use of core/shell latex manufacturing technology. The solution that appears most promising is that of employing 
latex compositions comprising particles with a core/shell structure. Core/shell polymers are described in the Journal of Macro-molecular 
Science - Chem. A7(3), 623-646 (1973) by D.J. Williams et 
al. The core/shell polymer particles suitably used as binder in 
coatings generally are heterogeneous particles which have a core of 
a relatively hard polymeric material (high Tg) surrounded by one or 
more shells of a further, more flexible polymeric material (low 
Tg). The latter
