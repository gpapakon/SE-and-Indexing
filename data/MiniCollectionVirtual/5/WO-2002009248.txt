<DESCRIPTION>
 FACEPLATE FOR AN ELECTRICAL SWITCHBOARDDESCRIPTIONThe present invention relates to a faceplate for an electrical switchboard having improved functions and characteristics. It is known that low-voltage industrial electrical systems which handle high- level currents, and therefore high power levels, usually use specific devices which are commonly known in the art as automatic power circuit breakers. These automatic circuit breakers are meant to provide the performance required to ensure the correct operation of the electric power supply circuit that they protect and of the loads connected thereto. In particular, they protect the loads against abnormal events caused for example by failures arising from short circuits or overloads by automatically opening said power supply circuit; they allow the correct connection/disconnection of loads to/from the electric power supply circuit; they ensure that the nominal current for the various connected users is actually equal to the required current; they allow, by way of a manual intervention on an actuation lever of said circuit breaker and the associated separation of the moving contacts from the fixed contacts, the complete insulation of a load with respect to a power supply source and the consequent disconnection of the circuit that they protect. In practical use in electrical systems, automatic circuit breakers are generally used by arranging them in appropriately provided electrical switchboards, typically electrical distribution switchboards. These switchboards, according to solutions which are widely known in the art, use a supporting frame which bounds a volume in which the circuit breakers and any other electrical and/or electronic devices of the switchboard are placed; furthermore, said frame constitutes a skeleton which is suitable to structurally support the various components of the switchboard that are functionally connected thereto, such as guides or supporting plates on which the circuit breakers and the various 

devices are arranged, cladding plates, doors for opening/closing said switchboards, et cetera.In particular, the switchboards are provided with appropriate inspection doors which are functionally connected to the frame and are provided with suitable windows which allow to view and access the elements for controlling the circuit breakers and any other devices that are present.In the current state of the art, the solutions used to provide the doors and the modes for coupling to the devices have some drawbacks. In order to ensure correct

CLAIMS
1. A faceplate for an electrical switchboard, comprising a body which has a substantially quadrangular shape and is provided with an opening to accommodate at least part of an electrical and/or electronic device of the switchboard, said faceplate being suitable to be operatively coupled to a window provided on a plate, characterized in that said body has connection means for coupling to the plate, at the edges of said window, in a movable and adjustable manner with respect to the plate itself.
2. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to claim 1, characterized in that said connection means are suitable to allow coupling to the plate in a position which is adjustable on a plane substantially parallel to a reference plane on which said plate lies.
3. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said connection means comprise at least one hook which protrudes from a wall of the body transversely to a reference plane on which said opening lies.
4. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to claim 3, characterized in that said hook comprises a first portion, which has a substantially curved lateral cross-section and protrudes from an edge of said opening, and a second portion, which is structurally continuous with respect to the first portion, lies parallel to the extension of the wall, is spaced from it and is directed away from said opening.
5. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to claim 4, characterized in that said second portion ends with a contoured head which is suitable to mechanically stiffen the hook and facilitate its coupling to a corresponding edge of the window.
6. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to one or more of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that said hook is flexible. 

7. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to one or more of claims 3 to 6, characterized in that said connection means comprise two hooks which are arranged on the body on mutually opposite sides with respect to the opening and are orientated in opposite directions. 8. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to claim 7, characterized in that the two hooks are arranged on two opposite walls of the body in a position which is centered with respect to the opening.
9. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that a pocket is formed in a wall of said body, on the opposite side with respect to the one from which the hooks protrude, said pocket being suitable to accommodate means for identifying the device that can be accommodated in said opening.
10. The faceplate for electrical switchboard according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that along the edges of said opening a protruding edge is formed which protrudes transversely to it, said protruding edge being suitable to interact geometrically with the walls of said window and to facilitate its centering with respect to the opening.
11. An electrical switchboard, characterized in that it comprises a faceplate according to one or more of the preceding claims.
