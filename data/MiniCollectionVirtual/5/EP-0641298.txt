<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with a method of oligomerization of 1-butene to a hydrogen carbon comprising in average 12-48 carbon atoms and an unsaturated double bond, wherein the reaction temperature is ca -30...90  DEG C, the total pressure ca 1-15 bar and the retention time in the reaction ca 5 minutes...10 hours by using a complex of BF3 and water, C2-C10 monoalcohol or C2-C8 monocarboxylic acid as catalyst. The product obtained can be used as solvent or lubricant and as intermediate when preparing different chemicals for example lubricants or additives of those.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of oligomerization of 1-buteneThis invention is concerned with a method of oligomerization of 1-butene.KNOWN TECHNIQUEThe butene used for preparation of oligomers of butene has conventionally been iso- or tert-butene, that has been oligomerized to an oligomer of a suitable molar mass. These oligo- and polymers that are formed in the oligomerization of isobutene are called with a common name, poly-i-butenes or polybutylenes depending on the composition of the starting material. The source of i-butene has mainly been the so called raffinate I flow. In this raffinate I flow there are 1- and 2-butenes as well as butanes in addition to the isobutene. Alternatively the starting material used has been purified isobutene.One of the most important mechanisms of polymerization of olefines are the cationic mechanism and the coordination polymerization. Of these mechanisms, coordination polymerization is primarily used for preparation of poly-1-butene plastics if the structure of the product to be formed is wished to define very exactly in forehand. The cationic mechanism produces only oligomers or viscotic fluids, so called liquid polymers, in the polymerization of 1-butene.The catalysts used in the cationic mechanism have been Lewis acids such as BF3, AlClo, AlBr«, TiCL, SnCL etc. It is known that Lewis acid catalysts cannot alone initiate a polymerization reaction but need a proton donor or a cocatalyst. Such cocatalysts are for example water, alcohols, carboxylic acids, inorganic acids, given alkyl halides or halogenes. The oligomerization can be carried out in bulk, in other words without any auxiliary solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent. Such inert solvents are for example alkanes such as hexane and heptane and cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and cycloheptane. 

 Oligomers suitable for different applications have thus conventionally been prepared by oligomerization of isobutene or of the raffinate I flow. The catalyst used has been for example BFg and AlClg. Generally, water, short-chained alcohols and organic acids have been mentioned as cocatalysts. 1-Butanol has generally been used together with BF« as cocatalyst when the intention has been to produce fractions suitable as lubricants and additives of those. These fractions have generally been produced by copolymerization. Larkin et al. (US 4 417 082, 4395 578 and 4434309) used 1-butene as short chained define and Cg...Cjg alkene as long chained define in the copolymerization. The catalyst system was consisted of BFg and -1-butanol and
