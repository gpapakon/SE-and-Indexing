<ABSTRACT>
A process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of furoimidazole derivatives of general formula (I) with hydrogen in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst to give the corresponding diastereomeric dihydrofuroimidazole derivatives of general formula (II). The dihydrofuroimidazole derivatives of general formula (II) are intermediates for the preparation of (+)-biotin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel process for the 
asymmetric hydrogenation of furoimidazole derivatives of the 
general formula: 
 
   wherein R1 is a protecting group, which can be removed by 
methods known in the art and being selected from a phenyl-(C1-C6)-alkyl 
group, a benzyl group or a naphthyl-(C1-C6)-alkyl 
group, the aromatic nuclei of each of the groups 
being unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents 
selected from the group comprising (C1-C6)-alkyl, 
(C1-C6)-alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, (C1-C6)-alkylamino 
and (C1-C6)-dialkylamino, and R2 is hydrogen or 
a protecting group which can be removed by methods known 
in the art and being selected from a (C1-C6)-alkanoyl 
group, a (C1-C6)-alkoxy-(C1-C6)-alkyl group, a (C1-C6)-alkoxycarbonyl 
group, or aroyl or a benzyl group which is 
unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents 
selected from the group comprising (C1-C6)-alkyl, (C1-C6)-alkoxy, 
hydroxy, halogen, amino, (C1-C6)-alkylamino 
and (C1-C6)-dialkylamino, in the presence of a homogeneous 
catalyst with hydrogen to give a corresponding diastereomeric 
dihydrofuroimidazole derivative df the formula:  
 
 
   wherein R1 and R2 have the above-mentioned meaning.  
 The dihydrofuroimidazoles of the general formula II are 
important intermediates in the synthesis of (+)-biotin, an 
essential vitamin for humans which is also termed vitamin H. 
(+)-Biotin is also used as a pharmaceutical for the treatment 
of dermatosis or as a feed additive having growth-promoting 
activity for farm animals. The majority of the known (+)-biotin syntheses pursue the 
aim of separating appropriate precursors via some highly 
laborious racemate cleavage methods using some highly 
expensive cleavage agents and using the resulting 
diastereomers to further pursue the (+)-biotin synthesis (cf., 
for example German Patent No. 2,058,248). According to 
European Published Patent Application No. 273,270, the 
introduction of the relevant optically active center, that is, 
the 3aS and 6aR positions of the biotin ring structure, was 
achieved for the first time via an asymmetric hydrogenation of 
corresponding furoimidazole derivatives using a classical 
hydrogenation catalyst, such as, rhodium on aluminum oxide. 
This prior art process was not completely satisfactory with 
respect to the attainable yield of the desired diastereomers. The main object of the invention is to provide an 
improved asymmetric hydrogenation process by which the above-mentioned 
key step of the biotin synthesis can
