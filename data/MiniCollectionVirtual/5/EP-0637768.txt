<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fibre-optic cable, in particular for a distribution network, which comprises a set of optical fibres. It is characterised in that each of the optical fibres has a mode field diameter of between 7 and 9  mu m at about 1550 nm and a cutoff wavelength less than or equal to 1.35  mu m, and in that the optical fibres are combined in the cable by being twisted together or along a strength (reinforcement) member, or arranged lengthwise.
