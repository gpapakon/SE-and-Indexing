<CLAIMS>
Objects made of platinum and palladium, which are 
provided with a hard and scratch-resistant surface 

layer, which layer contains boron, wherein the 
platinum may contain up to 25 wt.% of precious metals 

and base metals and the palladium may contain up to 
65 wt.% of other precious metals and up to 15 wt.% of 

base metals, with the hardened surface layer being 
from 20 to 500 µm thick and containing from 0.3 up to 

1.5 wt.% of boron, which is to a very large extent 

included in the metal lattice. 
Objects according to claim 1, wherein the hardened 
surface layer is from 30 to 250 µm thick and contains 

from 0.5 to 0.9 wt.% of boron. 
Process for the hardening of objects made of platinum 
and palladium according to claim 1 or 2, by treatment 

with boron-donating substances at elevated 
temperatures, characterised in that the objects are 

heated in a mixture comprising a boronising agent, an 
activator and optionally an inert substance, at 

temperatures of from 500°C up to the melting point of 
the corresponding platinum-boron or palladium-boron 

eutectic mixture, until a surface layer of from 20 to 
500 µm has a boron content of from 0.3 to 1.5 wt.%. 
Process for the hardening of objects according to 
claim 3, characterised in that the mixture contains 70 

to 95 wt.% of amorphous boron and/or boron carbide as 
boronising agent and 5 to 30 wt.% of potassium 

borofluoride as activator.
