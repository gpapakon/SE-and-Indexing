<ABSTRACT>
A pourable, dust-free feedstuff is produced from legume oilseeds, in particular from rape seed and/or mustard seeds which, after threshing, are cleaned, dried and crushed. Crushed oil seeds having a predetermined oil content are available. A lignin-containing compound and a sugar-containing composition are added to the crushed seeds with addition of water. Intensive stirring generates a homogeneous mixture having a temperature elevated by frictional heat. The homogeneous mixture is subdivided into pellets, is heated still moist in a toaster to a temperature above the boiling point of water and dried. The dried pellets can be moistened with water containing a lignin-containing compound and can be compacted between a pair of rollers to give coarse meal, flakes or grits.
