<ABSTRACT>
In a shuttle valve arrangement for connecting between the two pressure-medium ports (1, 2) on a working cylinder (3) on the one hand and the associated reversing valves (6, 7) on the other hand, which are connected to the pressure-medium feed line (4) and the pressure-medium discharge line (5) respectively, in each case a holding valve (29, 30) is provided per cylinder side. The operating member (31, 32) of the holding valve (29, 30) is connected to an opening device (33, 34) which can be actuated by pressure medium and whose working space (35, 36) is connected to the other respective port (11, 12) on the reversing-valve side. This ensures that the working cylinder (3) remains locked in its respective position if there is a lack of pressure-medium feed.
