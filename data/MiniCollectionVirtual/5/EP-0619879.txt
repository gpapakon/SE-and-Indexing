<ABSTRACT>
A gas sample chamber (10) for use in a gas analyzer consists of an elongated hollow tube (21) having an inwardly-facing specularly-reflective surface (22) that permits the tube to function also as a light pipe for conducting radiation from a source (12) to a detector (14) through the sample gas. A number of apertures (24) in the wall of the elongated hollow tube permit the sample gas to enter and exit. Particles of smoke and dust of a size greater than 0.1 micron are kept out of the chamber by use of a semi-permeable membrane (28) that spans the apertures in the hollow tube. Condensation of the sample gas components is prevented by heating the sample chamber electrically to a temperature above the dew point of the component of concern. In one embodiment, more than one detector (40, 42, 44) are spaced around the periphery of the elongated hollow tube adjacent one end of it. In another embodiment, more than one detector (56, 58, 60) are spaced along the length of the elongated hollow tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTI-CHANNEL GAS SAMPLE CHAMBERDESCRIPTION Technical FieldThe present invention is in the field of gas analyzers and specifically relates to a sample chamber for use in a gas analyzer of the type known as an NDIR (nondispersive infrared) analyzer.Background ArtThe NDIR technique has long been considered one of the best methods for gas measurement. In addition to being highly specific, the NDIR-gas analyzers are also very sensitive, stable, reliable, and easy to maintain. The major drawback of the NDIR gas measurement technique has been its complicated and expensive implementation.An NDIR gas analyzer typically includes an infrared source, a motor-driven mechanical chopper to modulate the source so that synchronous detection can be used, a pump to push or pull gas through a sample chamber, a bandpass filter, a sensitive infrared detector plus expensive infrared optics and windows to focus the infrared energy from the source onto the detector. Thus, despite the fact that the NDIR gas measurement technique is one of the best, it has not found wide application because of its complexity and high cost of implementation.The present invention significantly simplifies the implementation of the NDIR gas measurement technique, and this simplification results in a concomitant reduction in cost, thereby opening dozens of applications for the NDIR technique that were heretofore considered impractical 

 because of cost or complexity.For example, the sample chamber of the present invention is at the heart of a much faster and sensitive carbon dioxide detector for use in sensing fires, (U.S. Patent No. 5,053,754 issued October 1, 1991 to the present applicant, and is also at the heart of a ventilation controller that is highly useful in combatting indoor air pollution by monitoring the concentration of carbon dioxide in the indoor air and bringing in fresh air when the carbon dioxide concentration is excessive.The present invention for a simplified gas sample chamber provides a novel approach for reducing the complexity of NDIR gas measurement systems by eliminating the need for: expensive optics, mechanical choppers, and a pump for pulling or pushing the gas into the sample chamber. In addition, the sample chamber of the present invention provides a long effective pathlength which increases the detection sensitivity.In U.S. Patent No. 4,709,150 issued November 24, 1987 to Burough et al. , there is described a gas sample chamber that consists of a tube composed of a porous material such as plastic or a sintered

 CLAIMS
1. A multi-channel gas sample chamber for conducting radiation through a gas, characterized by: an elongated hollow tube, composed of a gastight material, and having an inwardly-facing specularly- reflective surface that conducts radiation introduced at one end of said elongated hollow tube toward the other end with high efficiency by means of multiple reflections from said inwardly-facing specularly-reflective surface, portions of said elongated hollow tube defining more than one aperture located intermediate the ends of said elongated hollow tube, portions of said elongated hollow tube defining more than one detector port extending through said elongated hollow tube; and, a sheet of a semi-permeable membrane covering said more than one aperture, said sheet permitting airborne particles smaller than a specific size to diffuse through it into the space within said elongated hollow tube and preventing airborne particles larger than said specific size from entering said space.

3. The multi-channel gas sample chamber of Claim 1 wherein said more than one detector port are spaced along the length of said elongated hollow tube.
4. The multi-channel gas sample chamber of Claim 1 further characterized by: means for heating said specularly-reflective surface to a temperature above the dew point of the gas to prevent condensation on said specularly-reflective surface. 


 5. The multi-channel gas sample chamber of Claim 4 wherein said more than one detector port are spaced around the periphery of said elongated hollow tube adjacent one end of it.
6. The multi-channel gas sample chamber of Claim 4 wherein said more than one detector port are spaced along the length of said elongated hollow tube.
