<ABSTRACT>
A handheld meat tenderizer includes a housing (2), a blade assembly comprising a blade 
holder (13) and a plurality of elongated blades (7), a guide plate (4) for the blades which is 

mounted by way of resilient mounting means (6) on the housing, and a motor (10) within the 
housing for moving the blade assembly with a reciprocating motion. The housing comprises a 

blade housing portion (5) and a handle portion (3) which are removably attached to one 
another by screws (16) at a location remote from the blade assembly. The sharpened terminal 

portions of the blades (7) are located behind the exterior surface of the guide plate (4) until 
pressure is applied to the housing by the user to compress the resilient mounting means (6) and 

reduce the distance between the guide plate (4) and the housing (2), whereby on operation of 
the motor the blade terminal portions make reciprocating movements through an opening (8) 

in the guide plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a meat tenderizer, and more specifically, to a motorized handheld
meat tenderizer.There are several known methods for tenderizing meats, some chemical and some mechanical.
The chemical meat tenderizing processes are falling out of favour because of the required use
of chemicals and because of the present availability of mechanical tenderizers. Mechanical
meat tenderizers have been known for many years such as those described in US-A- 207,107,
US-A- 1,047,346, and US-A- 1,903,789. More recent popular meat tenderizers are disclosed in
US-A- 4,199,841 (Jaccard I) and US-A- 4,463,476 (Jaccard II). All of these patents disclose
handheld mechanical means for tenderizing meats, but none of them suggests the use of
motorized handheld means for this process.In Jaccard I a handheld meat tenderizer is disclosed which allows a plurality of incisions to be
made simultaneously in a meat cut and which comprises a plurality of blades attached to a
handle. The handle in Jaccard I comprises a pair of separable complementary members secured
together by a bolt extending through one of the handle members, through the blade
assembly, and in threaded engagement with the other handle member. Users of Jaccard I push
down on the handle and compression springs 59 permitting the blades to move up and down.In Jaccard II the same type of manual handheld tenderizer is disclosed having a liquid flow
channel therein to accommodate the flow of fluids therethrough for improved cleaning. In
both Jaccard I and Jaccard II springs and spring housings are needed, as is blade-handle
attachment, which somewhat complicates dismantling of the devices. Also, after cleaning or
blade replacement, reassembly of pieces including handle parts, springs, spring housings,
spacers, blades and other components, could become tedious and complicated. The
tenderizers disclosed in Jaccard I and Jaccard II have become very successful handheld meat
tenderizers both in households and commercial establishments. Cleaning and replacement of
the blades in these tenderizers can be complicated and somewhat difficult. The blade
segments of Jaccard I and Jaccard II are removed for sharpening or replacement by loosening
and removing a screw 25 (in US-A- 4,199,841). This process separates handle members 19 and
21 and opens the tenderizer so that blade segments 15 can be removed together with spacer
blocks 31 and 32. After the blade segment or segments are sharpened or removed and
replaced, spacer blocks 31 and 32 must be arranged and interfitted
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A handheld meat tenderizer including a housing (2), a blade assembly (13, 9)
comprising

one or more blade
segments (9) and a blade holder (13), the or each blade segment comprising a body portion

having a plurality of blades (7) extending therefrom; 
a guide plate (4) for the blades which is

mounted by way of resilient mounting means (6) on the housing; and a power means (10)
within the housing for moving the blade assembly with a reciprocating motion; the housing

comprising a blade housing portion (5) and a handle portion (3) which are removably attached
(16) to one another at a location remote from the blade assembly, and the sharpened terminal

portions of the blades (7) being located behind the exterior surface of the guide plate (4) until
pressure is applied to the housing by the user to compress the resilient mounting means and

reduce the distance between the guide plate (4) and the housing (2), whereby on operation of
the power means the blade terminal portions make reciprocating movements through an

opening (8) in the guide plate; and
wherein the blade holder (13) has at least one groove (33) of

T-shaped cross-section therein, and the edge of the body portion of a blade segment remote
from the blades is shaped for sliding engagement in the groove. 
The tenderizer of claim 1 wherein the body portion of the or each blade segment (9) is
slidably removable from, and replaceable in, the blade holder (13) when the two portions (3, 5)

of the housing are detached from one another.
The tenderizer of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the power means (10) is located in
the handle portion.
The tenderizer of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the power means (10) is an electric
motor.
The tenderizer of any one of claims 1 to 4 including connecting means (11, 12) to
convey said reciprocating motion from the power means to the blade assembly. 
The tenderizer of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the blade housing portion (5) and
the handle portion (3) are removably attached to one another by removable screws (16) spaced

from the blade assembly and out of contact therewith.
A blade segment (9) for use in a handheld meat tenderizer
according to claim 1,

comprising a substantially
planar, substantially rectangular, body portion having a plurality of elongated sharpened

blades (7) extending from one edge thereof, and at least part of the opposite edge of the body
portion being of T-shaped cross section for sliding engagement in a groove of corresponding

cross-sectional shape.
A blade assembly comprising a blade holder (13) and at least one blade segment (9) in
accordance with claim 7, the blade holder having one or more grooves (33) therein adapted to

receive the T-shaped portion of the or each blade segment.
