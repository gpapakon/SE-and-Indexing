<ABSTRACT>
A valve construction wherein the rotor shaft (32) of a 
reversible electric motor is axially displaceable between 

axially spaced elements (35,40) of a differential-screw system for 
driven displacement of a valve member (14). Each of these 

spaced elements is preferably a ball screw, independently 
cooperative with upper and lower regions of the rotor 

shaft, i.e., at the respective upper and lower sides of 
the rotor (31) carried by the shaft. The valve of the 

invention and its control and drive system are contained 
within a housing (10) which fixedly mounts (a) the ball-screw 

nut of the upper element of the differential-screw system 
and (b) the stator of the motor (30) , so that motor-driven 

rotation results in axial displacement of the rotor and 
its shaft, pursuant to the helical advance lead or pitch 

of the upper ball-screw nut. The ball-screw nut of the 
lower element of the differential-screw system is (a) 

engaged to the shaft and (b) axially displaceable yet 
effectively keyed against rotation with respect to the 

housing; and this lower ball-screw nut (40) is adapted to 
provide axial displacement control of a poppet-valve 

member (14) with respect to its coacting seat (13), in a valve-body 
passage between inlet and outlet ports (11,12) of the valve. 

Great mechanical advantage is achieved for relatively low 
motor-torque delivery, when the helical leads (or pitches) 

of the respective ball screws are in the same direction 
but are slightly different.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a valve construction and 
mode of operation for controlling the flow of a pressure 
fluid from an upstream source of high pressure supply to 
an outlet for downstream storage or utilization at reduced 
pressure. The invention has illustrative application as a 
regulating valve, wherein the upstream supply pressure is, 
at least initially, in the order of 10,000 psi, and 
wherein a relatively small-volume tank is to be loaded 
with smoothly ramped increasing pressure to a set point in 
the order of 800 psi, the valve being automatically 
modulated as needed to maintain tank ullage pressure in an 
operating band of Â± 50 psi, during step-off demands for 
operating fluid from the tank. For the indicated illustrative application of the 
invention, it was proposed to employ a motor-driven ball-screw 
system to develop requisite axial displacement for 
the valve member, with a lead of helical ball-screw 
advance in the order of 0.005 inch/revolution. But this 
was not possible, because the smallest ball screw 
available to carry the involved 10,000 psi unbalanced load 
has a lead of 1-mm/rev. (0.0394 inch/rev.). Thus, a 
single ball-screw design would place excessive torque and 
mass requirements on the motor, totally inconsistent with 
a design objective of minimizing bulk of the valve system. In the present description, for convenience of 
reference, the central axis of the valve system will be 
sometimes referred to as "vertical", thus justifying use 
of the words "upper" and "lower" in connection with 
various component parts. But it will be understood that a 
"vertical" orientation is not necessary for operation of 
the invention, in that valve operation is not in any sense  
 
dependent upon any relation to the instantaneous gravity 
vector. It is an object of the invention to provide an 
improved valve and valve-operating mechanism of the 
character indicated. A specified object is to meet the above object with a 
construction of minimum size and mass, and with the 
capacity to smoothly regulate relatively great pressure 
reduction from elevated upstream supply pressures. Another specific object is to meet the above objects 
with a construction and mode of operation that lend 
themselves to miniaturization, including full containment 
of electronics for control of valve-member position and 
displacement. The invention meets the above objects and provides 
further novel features, in a valve construction wherein 
the rotor shaft of a reversible electric motor is axially 
displaceab
