<ABSTRACT>
The turn-up portion of the carcass ply (12) in 
the bead portion of a pneumatic tire is interposed 

between the bead core (11) and a toe guard (18), and 
extends a substantial distance toward the maximum 

section width of the tire. The bead core (11) has a 
radial cross section which is substantially 

pentagonal. The toe guard (18) comprises a rubber 
material, a flexible textile material or a heat 

shrinkable material that protects the toe portion of 
the tire. Elastomeric stiffening member (20) may be 

disposed on each side of the carcass ply (12) in the 
bead portions and lower sidewalls of the tire. The 

assembly of a tire according to the invention mounted 
upon a specified rim (22) is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the bead portion 
of a pneumatic tire, and more specifically to a tire 
having a bead portion which has a pentagonal shape, no 
apex, a high turn-up and a locked-in structure when 
mounted on a specified rim. The present invention is an improvement on U.S. 
Patent 5,058,649 issued October 22, 1991. The desirability of having the turn-up portions 
of the carcass ply (or plies) of a pneumatic tire 
extend radially outwardly of the bead core the 
shortest possible distance is the premise on which 
prior art locked beads were developed. The proposed 
advantages included improved bead durability, and 
reduced material costs. Referring to Fig. 3 there is shown a bead 
portion of a prior art tire as taught in commonly 
owned U. S. Patent 4,922,985, issued May 8, 1990. The 
carcass ply 30 has a main portion that extends between 
both bead cores (not shown) of the tire and turn-up 
portions that are anchored around each bead core 31. The "main portion of the carcass ply" is 
understood to mean the portion of the carcass ply 
which extends between the bead cores. It is 
understood that as used herein and in the claims a 
carcass ply comprises reinforcing cords embedded in an 
elastomeric substance and that these components are 
considered to be a single entity. Tires according to  
 
this prior art embodiment and U.S. Patent 5,058,649 
have the radially outer edges of the turn-up portions 
of the carcass ply disposed radially outwardly of the 
bead cores a minimal distance and are in contact with 
the main portion of the carcass ply. Suitable 
elastomeric materials surround the bead core, carcass 
ply, and other elastomeric components to complete the 
bead portion of the tire. As used herein, the terms "radial" and "radially" 
refer to directions going towards or away from the 
axis of rotation of a tire. The terms "axial" and 
"axially" indicate directions that are parallel to the 
axis of rotation of a tire. In tires according to this prior art embodiment 
and U.S. Patent 5,058,649, a turn-up portion of the 
carcass ply 30 extends radially outwardly of the bead 
core 31 a minimal distance to allow for some pull-down 
of the carcass ply during the shaping and curing 
process. For example, in a passenger tire the edge of 
the turn-up portion may be located about 10 mm 
radially outwardly of the bead core. In the prior art embodiment illustrated in Fig. 
3, as well as in a tire and tire and wheel assembly 
according to U.S. Patent 5,058,649, a clamping member 
32 comprised a strip
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic tire (10) comprising: 

a pair of axially spaced apart annular bead cores 
(11), each bead core comprising a plurality of wraps of a 

single metallic filament, each bead core having a 
cross-sectional shape which is substantially pentagonal 

with the greatest axial width of the bead core being 
located radially outwardly of the radially innermost edge 

of the bead core, and with the radially outermost extent 
of the bead core being the vertex of two of the sides of 

said pentagon; 
a carcass ply or plies (12) folded about each bead 
core (11), said carcass ply having a main portion that 

extends between the bead cores and turn-up portions that 
are folded around the bead cores; 
belt plies (13,14) radially outwardly of the 
carcass ply or plies (12) in a crown portion of the tire 

and an elastomeric tread portion (15) disposed radially 
outwardly of the belt plies; 
a pair of sidewalls (16); and 
an axially outer elastomeric stiffening member 
(20) located axially outwardly of the main and turn-up 

portions of the carcass ply and extending from a radially 
inner end located radially inwardly of the radially 

outermost extent of the bead core (11), to a radially 
outer end which is disposed radially outwardly of the 

flange of a rim (22) when the tire is mounted on a rim;
 
characterized in that a radially outer edge of each 

turn-up portion is in contact with said main portion and 
extends 3,8 cm (1.5 inches) to 8,9 cm (3.5 inches) above 

said bead core; and
 
   in that each high end (12a, 12b) of a carcass ply 

turn-up is locked against the main portion of the carcass 
ply or plies (12) by the sidewall (16). 
The pneumatic tire of claim 1 which comprises a 
toe guard (18) which is disposed directly adjacent to 

said carcass ply (12) on the side of the carcass ply 
distal from said bead core (11) from a location axially 

inwardly of the bead core and about 2.5 cm (one inch) 
radially outward of the bead core to a location radially 

coinciding substantially with the widest cross section 
width of the bead core, wherein the respective turn-up 

portion of the carcass ply (12) is directly adjacent to 
both the toe guard and the bead core. 
The pneumatic tire of claim 2 wherein said toe 
guard (18) is selected form the group consisting of a 

rubber strip, and a strip of side by side cords of non-metallic 
heat shrinkable material which has permanent 

thermal shrinkage of at least 2%. 
The pneumatic tire of claim 1 wherein the 
elastomeric stiffening member (20) is of an elastomeric 

compound having a Shore D hardness of 30 or greater and a 
Young's Modulus of 23 MPa (3,400 pounds per square inch) 

or greater. 
The pneumatic tire of claim 1 wherein the 
stiffening member (20) comprises coextruded compounds 

which have different properties in an axially inner 
portion X and an axially outer portion Y. 
The pneumatic tire of claim 5 wherein there is 
a less stiff compound in the axially inner portion X of 

the stiffening member (20) to cushion the carcass ply 
(12) and the turn-up from forces encountered by the 

outside of the tire. 
An assembly comprising the pneumatic tire 
defined in any of claims 1-6 mounted upon a rim (22) 

specified for use with the tire in the YEAR BOOK OF THE  
 

TIRE AND RIM ASSOCIATION INC. for the year in which the 
tire is manufactured, said rim having rim flanges (22a).
