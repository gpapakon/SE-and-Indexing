<ABSTRACT>
Two light-deflecting units are provided which are arranged symmetrically to each other, referred to an axis running in the plane of the document at right angles to the document transport direction, and each has a first limiting surface which deflects the light beam reflected from a front or rear document column parallel to the document plane to a second limiting surface inclined at an angle of 45 DEG . The light beam reflected at the second limiting surface in the direction of the document upper edge is finally deflected by means of a third and fourth limiting surface in such a way that the light beams reflected in each case at the fourth limiting surface are incident on the image converter as an image of the front or rear document column, respectively, in alignment with each other in a line parallel to the document plane.

Apparatus for the two-sided optical scanning of
documents, using at least one illumination device, two

light deflection units which are spatially assigned
respectively to the front side and rear side of the

document, as well as an optoelectrical image converter
for the simultaneous column-by-column scanning of the

front side of the document and the rear side of the
document, the two light deflection units (1, 2) being

arranged symmetrically with respect to one another,
with reference to an axis running in the plane of the

document perpendicularly to the document conveying
direction, and each having a first interface (G1),

characterized in that the first interface deflects the
light beam, which is respectively reflected from a

front and rear document column (SPV, SPR), parallel to

the document plane in the document conveying direction
to a second interface (G2), which is inclined at an

angle of 45° with respect to the first interface, and
in that the light beam reflected at the second

interface (G2) in the direction of the upper edge of
the document is deflected by means of a third interface

(G3) and fourth interface (G4) in such a way that the
light beams respectively reflected at the fourth

interface (G4) impinge on the image converter as an
image respectively of the front and rear document 

columns (SPV', SPR') in alignment with one another in a
line parallel to the document plane.
Apparatus according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the light deflection unit (1, 2)
comprises a plurality of reflecting surfaces which are

fixed in their position relative to one another.
Apparatus according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the light deflection unit (1, 2)
comprises a single prism body whose light entry face

(LE), which runs perpendicularly to the document
conveying direction, is part of a first prism, in that

a second prism, which receives the reflected light beam
from the first prism, is designed as a plane-parallel

triangular body with its interface (G2) inclined
through 45°, and in that the third and fourth

interfaces (G3, G4) are assigned to a third prism,
which has the cross-section of a parallelogram with an

angle of inclination of 45°.
Apparatus according to Claim 3,

characterized in that the prism body is composed of
glass.
Apparatus according to Claim 3,

characterized in that the prism body is composed of
transparent plastic.
Apparatus according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the optical imaging arrangement
provided in the beam path between illumination device

and image converter is at least partly integrated in
the prism body.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that the image converter is arranged
above the upper edge of the document symmetrically

between the two light deflection units.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that the light emerging from the light
deflection units is deflected via deflection mirrors to 

an image converter (BW) arranged next to the document
conveying path.
