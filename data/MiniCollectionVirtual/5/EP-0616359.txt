<ABSTRACT>
The electric incandescent lamp has a filament (2) centrically supported in a tubular 
envelope (1) by constrictions (6) in the envelope at areas where a refractory metal 

member (7) short-circuits turns (3') of the filament. The refractory metal member (7) is 
a sleeve around the filament (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric incandescent lamp comprising: 
a tubular sealed glass envelope; a helically coiled tungsten filament having turns, accommodated centrically within 
the envelope, the filament having end portions which are connected to current conductors 
passing through the envelope to the outside, the filament being supported between its end portions by at least one 
constriction made in the glass envelope at an area where turns of the filament are short-circuited 
by a member of refractory metal. Such an electric incandescent lamp is known from EP 0 446 458 A2. The filament must be supported between its end portions in order to 
prevent the filament from approaching the envelope too closely or even touching it. A 
local overheating of the envelope is thereby prevented. Supporting the filament also 
results in the possibility to align the filament with respect to a reflector in which the 
lamp is used. Wire-wound supports are present on the filament in most incandescent 
lamps to support the filament. These supports are applied to the filament when the 
coiling mandrel onto which the filament was coiled, is still present. The supports have a 
helically coiled portion about the filament, and a spiralling portion engaging the 
envelope. The filament must then be processed in order to remove the winding mandrel 
by etching and to secure current conductors. The processing of the filaments provided 
with their supports is cumbersome, however, because of the projecting supports. The 
supports of the filaments may, moreover, hook into one another, necessitating their 
disentanglement. According to EP 0 446 458 A2, the filament may be supported by 
constrictions in the envelope directly engaging the filament in quartz glass lamps  
 
consuming a low power of up to 75 W. In quartz glass lamps consuming a higher 
power the constriction may touch a spacer in the filament. A spacer may be a single-coiled 
section or a non-coiled section of the filament between two coiled sections. Such 
intermediate sections consume less power per unit of filament length, have a lower 
temperature and may therefore be in contact with a quartz glass envelope without 
causing damage to the envelope. 
It is said to be advantageous to have a core rod present in the filament at the area where 
it is in direct contact with the envelope. The core rod short-circuits turns of the 
filament, thereby lowering their temperature. It is cumbersome, however, to maintain part of the winding mandrel as a 
core rod in the
