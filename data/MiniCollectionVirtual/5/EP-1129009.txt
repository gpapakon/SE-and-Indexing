<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device consisting of a single chamber (7) containing and bearing the reservoir (A), dispensing means (B), distribution means consisting of rotary cylindrical brushes (39a to 39c), while the dispensing means (B) consist of two parallel flaps (15, 16) urged into closing contact against the chamber (7) upstream transverse wall (12a), in the proximity of the alveolate sheet (5), are connected, by their rear ends, to independent means (18, 19) capable of displacing them in one direction or another, the control means for opening and closing each flap (15 and 16) reacting, for the upper flap (15), to a volumetric sensor (34) detecting the amount of tablets accumulated in the buffer sieve (40), and, for the lower flap, to a sensor (38) provided above the unwinding sheet (5) upstream of the first brush (39a).

Device for feeding tablets to alveoli (6) provided in an unwinding sheet (5), the
device comprising a) a reservoir (A) for storage of the tablets, b) means (B) for dispensing a

batch of tablets through an opening in the reservoir extending over the width of the alveolate
sheet (5), these means comprising a sliding flap, the opening and closing movements of

which are determined by a control box reacting to a sensor (38) which detects the height of
the tablets arranged on the sheet, and c) means (C) for distribution of the tablets in the

unwinding alveoli, these means comprising transverse brushes (39), 
characterized in that
 it
comprises a single chamber (7) containing and bearing the storage reservoir (A), the

dispensing means (B) and the distribution means (C) comprising rotary cylindrical brushes
(39a to 39c), while the dispensing means (B) comprise two parallel flaps (15, 16) which,

forming the base of the reservoir and being a boundary of a buffer sieve (40), are inclined
with respect to the horizontal from top to bottom going upstream, come into closing contact

against the upstream transverse wall (12a) of the chamber (7), in the proximity of the
alveolate sheet (5), are movable in translation and are connected by their upper ends to

independent means (18,19) capable of displacing them in one direction or the other, the
control means for opening and closing each flap (15 and 16) reacting, for the upper flap (15),

to a volumetric sensor (34) detecting the amount of tablets accumulated in the buffer sieve
(40), and, for the lower flap, to a sensor (38) arranged above the unwinding sheet (5),

upstream of the first brush (39a), detecting the amount of tablets accumulated against this

brush.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lower end of the lower flap (16)
is, in the closing position, substantially in the horizontal diametral plane (P) of the first brush

(39a).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the lower edge of at least the upper
flap (15) comes into contact with a bar (32) which, mounted against the upstream transverse

wall (12a) of the chamber (7), is arranged above the sieve (40), forms a dispersing guide for
the tablets (14) from the reservoir (A) and contains at least one sensor (34) detecting the

volume of tablets accumulated in the sieve. 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 each of the two flaps cooperates
with a bar (60, 61) and each bar (60, 61) is fixed against a transverse wall (62a) with

interpositioned viscoelastic damping blocks (63) allowing at its edge, in cooperation with the
flap, elastic return in the event of an abnormal closing force.
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the two bars (60, 61) are arranged
in a housing (62) mounted against the upstream transverse wall (12a) of the chamber (7) and

each of them is associated with a suction opening (64) communicating above this with the
buffer sieve (40) and below this with the zone (Z1) for receiving the tablets on the alveolate

sheet (5).
Device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the edges facing a flap (15-16)
and/or the bar (32, or 60, 61) are fitted with rectilinear transverse brushes (30, 35).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the flaps (15, 16) are removable
with respect to their means for guiding in translation and their actuating means (18, 19) and

are each connected by a detachable connection of the complementary hook type to the upper
end of the corresponding flap.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the chamber (7) is mounted in a
sliding manner with respect to slide rails (8, 47) on a fixed frame and is connected to means

(9) capable of displacing it vertically between a working position, in which its brushes (39,
52) are in the proximity of or in contact with the alveolate sheet (5), and a disengaged

position in which they are at a distance from the path of this sheet (5).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the chamber (7) is fixed by
detachable means (53 to 55) on the vertical plate (45) of a housing (46) vertically

displaceable on the slide rails (47) of a frame (48, 49), arranged laterally to the conveyer (D)
moving the alveolate sheet (5), the said housing (46) containing, for each of the brushes (39,

52) of the chamber, an electric drive motor (50), the output shaft (75) of which is equipped
with means for connection in rotation and in translation (78, 79) and positioning means (76),

all capable of cooperating with complementary means (74, 80, 72) provided on the rear end
of the drive shaft (2) of each brush (39, 52). 
Device according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the cylindrical shaft (67) of each
brush is tubular, is mounted freely in rotation in bearings (69, 70) provided in the longitudinal

walls (12b, 12c) of the chamber (7) and has on its rear end projecting from the chamber (7) a
hemispherical cap (73) with claws (74) and a cylindrical shouldered bearing surface (72),

while the output shaft of the electric motor (50) forms one piece with a socket (75) flush with
the support plate (45) of the chamber (7), the said socket (75) comprising a threaded axial

well (79), a hemispherical cup (77) with claws (78), complementary to the cap (73) of the
tubular shaft (67) of the brush, and a shouldered bore (76) for receiving the shouldered

bearing surface (72) of this tubular shaft (67), the connection in translation between the
socket (75) and the tubular shaft (67) of the brush being ensured by an axial screw (80)

arranged in the tubular shaft (67), the threaded end of which screws into the threaded well
(79) of the socket and the head of which is supported on the front end of the said tubular shaft

(67).
