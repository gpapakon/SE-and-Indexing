<ABSTRACT>
An editing apparatus characterized by attaching an element data 
key possessing a format common to various kinds of element data 

such as documents, illustrations, and photographs which jointly 
form one page of the book, to each of the various kinds of 

element data thereby enabling the data concerning the elements 
to be handled as common data, causing data of an edited book to 

be decomposed into data concerning layout and other data 
concerning elements for storage, and composing data for one 

page with the data concerning the layout and the other data 
concerning desired elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an editing apparatus
More particularly
this invention relates to an editing apparatus
enabling
handling manuals such as for automobiles and electric
appliances, books in general, magazines, and newspapers
(hereinafter referred to collectively as "books") to be
edited quickly and easily.In recent years, the practice of performing the work of
editing a book by the use of a personal computer or a work
station (editing device) has been disseminated. In this
case, the work of editing a book is carried out by newly
feeding complete data on documents, illustrations, etc. for
each of the pages, with the whole information of an edited
book memorized as separated in units of page. With the 
conventional editing apparatus, however, those documents,
illustrations, etc. which appear in two or more places
cannot be utilized in common but must be repeatedly fed in
all over. The conventional editing apparatus, therefore,
takes up much time and labor in the production of a book.
The production of a book, accordingly, is very expensive. The article IEEE SOFTWARE, vol. 4, no. 2, March 1987, pages 4-14,
S. GIBBS ET AL. 'Muse: A Multimedia Filing System'
describes a multimedia filing system, which features flexible
document retrieval, a distributed architecture and the
capacity to store many large documents. The objects handled by
the described system are multimedia documents, namely
structured collections of document components. These
components may consist of attribute data, text data, image
data, graphical data or audio data. The document contains
information about the layout and conceptual structures. The
layout structure breaks the document into pages, each
containing a header that describes the position of components
on that page. The logical structure of the documents expresses
hierarchical relationships among components like words,
sentences, paragraphs and sections. The layout structure
describes how document components are positioned when they are
displayed.The article IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; OFFICE AUTOMATION
SYMPOSIUM; April 29, 1987, Nat.B. of Standards, Gaithersburg,
pp. 180-189, D. WOLK ET AL., "MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS AND
DATABASE REQUIREMENTS" relates to a system architecture for
multimedia applications that includes both a data base
management system and an intelligent user interface management
system. The system described in this article addresses the
issues of capture, storage, retrieval, presentation,
manipulation, editing and behaviour of multimedia data in a
hybrid environment
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An editing apparatus, comprising

layout code setting means (101, 111, 114) for setting a
layout code which designates a layout of a page to be

edited,
element data key setting means (103) for setting an

element data key corresponding to element data,
element input means (102) for introducing element data
forming each page subsequently to the element data key,
coordinates setting means (104) for setting the
positional coordinates of each of the element data on

the basic layout,
first page data setting means (105) for

-- setting a layout for editing based on the
positional coordinates and the element data key of

the element data corresponding to the positional
coordinates,
-- setting a group of element data based on the
element data key forming the layout for editing and 

the element data corresponding to the element data
key, and
-- setting data for one page based on the layout code,

data,
layout conversion means (121) for setting layout
information for one page by deleting the element data

from the group of element data for one page,
first layout memory means (125) for memorizing the
layout information,
element conversion means (122) for extracting the group
of element data from the data for one page and

decomposing said group according to individual elements
