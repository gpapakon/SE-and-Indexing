<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing an oligomeric copolymer of an 
unsaturated acidic reactant and a high molecular weight 

olefin having a sufficient number of carbon atoms such that 
the resulting copolymer is soluble in lubricating oil and 

wherein at least 20 weight percent of the total olefin 
comprises an alkylvinylidene isomer, which process comprises 

reacting the high molecular weight olefin with the 
unsaturated acidic reactant in the presence of a free 

radical initiator and a solvent selected from: 

(a) polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride (PIBSA), 
(b) polyPIBSA, or 
(c) a mixture comprising polyisobutene and a copolymer 
prepared by reacting a high molecular weight olefin, 

wherein at least 20 weight percent of the total olefin 
comprises an alkylvinylidene isomer, and an unsaturated 

acidic reactant in the presence of a free radical 
initiator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent application is a division of the European patent
application 89 911336.9 filed on 29 September 1989 and published
under No. 0387,346. It is directed to the process aspect of this
parent invention.EP-A-0,387,346 relates to compositions which are
useful as intermediates for dispersants used in lubricating
oil compositions or as dispersants themselves. In addition,
some of these compositions are useful in the preparation of
novel high molecular weight dispersants which have superior
dispersant properties for dispersing sludge and varnish and
superior Viton Seal compatibility.The high molecular weight dispersants of EP-A-0387,346,
referred to hereinafter as being the parent invention,
also advantageously impart fluidity modifying
properties to lubricating oil compositions which are sufficient
to allow elimination of some proportion of viscosity
index improver from multigrade lubricating oil compositions
which contain these dispersants.Alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been used as
dispersants. Such alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydrides
have been prepared by two different processes, a thermal
process (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,361,673) and a
chlorination process (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,172,892).
The polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride ("PIBSA") produced by
the thermal process has been characterized as a monomer
containing a double bond in the product. Although the exact
structure of chlorination PIBSA has not been definitively
determined, the chlorination process PIBAs have been characterized
as monomers containing either a double bond, a ring,
other than a succinic anhydride ring and/or chlorine in the
product. [See J. Weill and B. Sillion, "Reaction of
Chlorinated Polyisobutene with Maleic Anhydride:Mechanism 
Catalysis by Dichloromaleic Anhydride", Revue de l'Institut
Fran√ßais du Petrole, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 77-89
(January-February, 1985).] Such compositions include
one-to-one monomeric adducts (see, e.g., U.S. Patents
Nos. 3,219,666; 3,381,022) as well as adducts having polyalkenyl-derived
substituents adducted with at least 1.3
succinic groups per polyalkenyl-derived substituent (see,
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,234,435).In addition, copolymers of maleic anhydrides and some aliphatic
alpha-olefins have been prepared. The polymers so
produced were useful for a variety of purposes including
dispersants for pigments and intermediates in the preparation
of polyesters by their reaction with polyols or polyepoxides.
However, olefins having more than about 30 carbon
atoms
