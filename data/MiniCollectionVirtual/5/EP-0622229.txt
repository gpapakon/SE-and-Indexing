<ABSTRACT>
In bidirectional inkjet printing, in certain 
situations the printer uses relatively large amounts of ink 

-- in relation to the amount of liquid carrier that can be 
absorbed by or evaporated from the printing medium that is 

in use. For example, this occurs when a printer does 
double-ink-drop (34,34') printing on transparency stock, 

particularly for particular colors (e.g., cyan). In such 
situations an undesirable, unesthetic mottling effect can 

arise. It has been discovered that, in this case, print 
quality can be improved by deliberately selecting a relatively 

large amount of jitter or random variation (t₄-t₁, 
t₄'-t₁') in firing time within each pixel column -- actually 

the equivalent of about one eighth of a column width.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to machines and
procedures for printing text or graphics on printing media
such as paper, transparency stock, or other glossy media;
and more particularly to such a machine and method that
constructs text or images from individual marks created on
the printing medium, in a two-dimensional pixel array, by
a pen or other marking element or head that scans across
the medium bidirectionally.The invention is particularly beneficial in printers
that operate by the thermal-inkjet process -- which discharges
individual ink drops onto the printing medium. As
will be seen, however, certain features of the invention
are applicable to other scanning-head printing processes
as well.Bidirectional operation of any scanning-head device
is advantageous in that no time is wasted in slewing or
returning the print head across the medium to a starting
position after each scan; however, bidirectional operation
does present some obstacles to precise positioning of the 
printed marks, and also to best image quality. In order
to describe these obstacles it will be helpful first to
set forth some of the context in which these systems
operate.In many printing devices, position information is
derived by automatic reading of graduations along a scale
or so-called "encoder strip" (or sometimes "codestrip")
that is extended across the medium. The graduations
typically are in the form of opaque lines marked on a
transparent plastic or glass strip, or in the form of
solid opaque bars separated by apertures formed through a
metal strip.Such graduations typically are sensed electrooptically
to generate an electrical waveform that may be characterized
as a square wave, or more rigorously a trapezoidal
wave. Electronic circuitry responds to each pulse in the
wavetrain, signalling the pen-drive (or other marking-head-drive)
mechanism at each pixel location -- that is,
each point where ink can be discharged to form a properly
located picture element as port of the desired image.These data ore compared, or combined, with information
about the desired image -- triggering the pen or
other marking head to produce a mark on the printing
medium at each pixel location where a mark is desired. As
will be understood, these operations are readily carried
out for each of several different ink colors, for printing
machines that are capable of printing in different colors.In addition to this use of the encoder-derived signal
as an absolute physical reference for firing the pens, the
frequency of the wavetrain is

A method of printing images on a printing medium by construction from
individual marks formed in pixel arrays by a bidirectionally scanning inkjet pen, said

method comprising the steps of:

scanning the pen (31) in a first direction (63
F
) across such a medium (33);
while scanning the pen in the first direction, monitoring (64,65,73,74,61) the
position of the pen relative to desired pixel locations, and firing (61,77) the pen to

form an ink spot (34) of particular color on such medium in each particular desired
ink-spot location;
then scanning the pen in a second direction (63
B
) across such medium;
while scanning the pen in the second direction, monitoring (64,65,72,74,61)
the position of the pen relative to desired pixel locations, and firing (61,77) the pen to

form an ink spot (34') of the same particular color on such medium in each same
particular desired ink-spot location, so that at least two spots (34,34') of ink of that

particular color are formed at each pixel where an ink spot is desired;
