<ABSTRACT>
The present invention therefore provides a transcriptional regulatory element which is capable of directing expression of a gene specifically in cells of the endothelial lineage. Preferably, the transcriptional regulatory element comprises the initiation codon and the untranslated sequences of tek, a protein tyrosine kinase expressed during murine cardiogenesis and homologues thereof including the human tek gene. The transcriptional regulatory element may be used to target expression of a gene in cells of the endothelial lineage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel transcriptional
regulatory element which is capable of directing
expression of a gene specifically in cells of the
endothelial lineage; a recombinant molecule containing the
transcriptional regulatory element; a transformant host
cell including the recombinant molecule; a DNA construct
comprising the transcriptional regulatory element
operatively linked to a gene and a reporter gene; and, the
use of the transcriptional regulatory element to target
expression of a gene in cells of the endothelial lineage.Tissue specific transcriptional regulatory
elements have been identified which have been used to
target expression of exogenous genes in cells and in
transgenic animals. For example, DNA constructs using an
erythroid specific transcriptional element and an oncogene
encoding a protein having protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)
activity have been used to produce transgenic animals
which have cardiovascular disease {Yee, S.P. et al. (1989)
P.N.A.S., U.S.A. 86, 5873-5877).The ability to introduce into animals exogenous
genes which are selectively expressed in a particular cell
type provides wide ranging experimental as well as
practical opportunities. In particular it permits
investigation of the role of a substance in the
development, determination, migration, or proliferation of
cells of a particular lineage.Dumont et al (Oncogene (1992), 7:1471-1480)
report the isolation of a novel tyrosine kinase,
designated tek which maps to mouse chromosome 4 between
the brown and pmv-23 loci. They showed by in situ
hybridization that tek is expressed in the endocardium as 
well as the endothelial lining of the vasculature.It was therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a transcriptional regulatory element capable of
directing expression of a gene in cells of the endothelial
lineage.The present inventors have identified and isolated a
transcriptional regulatory element capable of directing
expression of a gene in cells of the endothelial lineage.
The transcriptional element is expressed in cells of the
endothelial lineage including mature and progenitor cells. The present invention therefore provides an
isolated transcriptional regulatory element which is capable of
directing expression of a gene specifically in cells of
the endothelial lineage. The transcriptional
regulatory element comprises the initiation codon and the
untranslated sequences of tek, a protein tyrosine kinase
expressed during marine cardiogenesis.
The
transcriptional regulatory element is a 7.2 kb fragment
