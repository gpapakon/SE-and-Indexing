<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant 
thermoplastic resin composition. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a flame retardant 
thermoplastic resin composition having an excellent non-flammability 
and having such satisfactory various 
properties that a corrosive gas or a toxic gas is not 
generated, that molding processability is not low, and 
that mechanical strength of a molded product is not low. A thermoplastic resin is generally excellent in 
electric properties and mechanic strength, and is 
therefore widely used for automobile parts, domestic 
electrical equipments and the like. However, since a 
thermoplastic resin is generally easily flammable, a 
satisfactory flame retardancy or non-flammability is 
required depending on its use, and the requirement of the 
flame retardancy or non-flammability becomes severe year 
by year. In order to satisfy this requirement, various  
 
flame retardant thermoplastic resin compositions are 
proposed. For example, a thermoplastic resin composition having 
an organic halogen type flame retardant and antimony 
oxide incorporated has a flame retardancy and a 
relatively satisfactory mechanical strength which is not 
lowered after being molded, but has a disadvantage that a 
corrosive gas or a toxic gas is generated during molding 
or burning. Accordingly, it is proposed in Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 110738/1985 that a non-halogen 
type flame retardant such as a metal hydroxide 
including aluminium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide is 
used for polypropylene resin in place of the organic 
halogen type flame retardant. However, in order to make 
the polypropylene resin composition highly non-flammable 
by incorporating these metal hydroxides, a large amount 
of metal hydroxide must be incorporated, and as this 
results, molding processability and mechanical strength 
of a molded product become poor. Also, there is a method for incorporating a char-forming 
additive as a non-halogen type flame retardant. 
The char-forming additive provides a flame retardant 
thick wall in the presence of fire, and intercepts oxygen 
from a base polymer, thereby preventing the polymer from 
burning. This type of a char-forming agent often has an 
intumescence, and is reported to be an intumescent flame  
 
retardant agent. For example, it is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication No. 108140/1978 that a combination of 
ammonium polyphosphate and pentaerythritol has a function 
as an expandable carbonized material-forming
