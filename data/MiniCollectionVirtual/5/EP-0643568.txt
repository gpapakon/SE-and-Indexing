<ABSTRACT>
A support device for a dentist's drill comprising a support (14), an articulated arm (44) comprising two articulated quadrilateral devices (46, 48) disposed in series with one another, and adjustment means (64) operable to vary the direction of the working axis (54) of the drill. The support (14) is provided with fixing means (16) for connecting it to a seat back (18) of a dentist's chair (20) and the articulated arm (44) can assume a working condition in which the two articulated quadrilateral devices (46, 48) are disposed at 90 DEG  to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support device for a
dentist's drill.Tooth drilling or milling operations are normally performed
by guiding the drill freehand. This technique is imprecise
and leaves room for errors which become critical if the
milling of the teeth is performed as part of the preparation
for a prosthesis, which consists in milling the tooth
(or teeth) in such a way as to cut them down to the shape
of a conical stump over which the dental prosthesis is fitted.
In this type of operation, it is essential to guarantee
high precision in forming the conical walls of the
teeth.Support devices for dentist's drills have already been proposed,
which make it possible to set the working axis of
the drill in a predetermined direction and maintain the
working axis constantly parallel to itself during use.Examples of such devices are contained in documents US-A-2 801 469, US-A-3
083 462, DE-A-35 00 921 and FR-A-2 166 240.From US-A-3 083 462 there is known in particular a device having the characteristics
contained in the preamble of Claim 1. The object of the present invention is to provide a simple
and compact support device which does not obstruct the working
region in front of the patient and which can be easily
installed in any already existing dental surgery.According to the invention, this object is achieved by a
device having the characteristics forming the subject of
Claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention
will become apparent during the course of the following detailed
description, given purely by way of non-limitative
example, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a device according
to the present invention, fitted to a dentist's chair;Figure 2 is a side view in the direction of the arrow
II of Figure 1;Figure 3 is a section illustrating the detail indicated
by the arrow III in Figure 2; Figure 4 is a section taken on the line IV-IV of
Figure 3;Figures 5 and 6 are sections taken on the lines V-V
and VI-VI of Figure 2; andFigure 7 is a view on an enlarged scale of the part
indicated by the arrow VII of Figure 2.With reference to Figures 1 and 2, a device for
supporting and guiding a dentist's drill 12 is generally
indicated with the reference numeral 10.The device 10 comprises a support base constituted by a
generally L-shaped tubular column 14. The column 14 is
provided with a fixing device generally indicated 16, by
means of which the device 10 can be connected to the seat
back 18 of a dentist's chair 20. The dentist's

<CLAIMS>
A support device for a dentist's drill comprising:

a support (14) provided with fixing means (16),
an articulated arm (44) comprising two articulated
quadrilateral devices (46, 48) disposed in series with one

another, one (46) of which is connected to the support (14)
and the second (48) of which carries means (50) for attachment

of the dentist's drill (12), and
adjustment means (64) interposed between the support
(14) and the articulated arm (44) and operable to vary the

direction of the working axis (54) of the drill (12) with
respect to a stationary reference plane, in such a way that

the working axis (54) of the drill (12) can be displaced
within a working region whilst remaining constantly parallel

to a set direction,

in use said fixing means (16) connecting the support
(14) to a seat back (18) of a dentist's chair (20), so that

in a working configuration in which the two articulated quadrilateral
devices (46, 48) are disposed at 90Â° to one another,

the first articulated quadrilateral device (46) is
situated above the head of the patient and the second articulated

quadrilateral device (48) is disposed substantially
in front of the patient,

characterised in that said adjustment means (64) interposed
between the support (14) and the articulated arm

(44) includes a first pivotal coupling (56) having an axis
(58) parallel to the working axis (54) of the drill (12) in

any set direction of the working axis (54).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
it includes a counterbalancing device (86, 88, 102)

operable to balance the weight of the articulated arm

(44) and the parts connected to it.
A device according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the said counterbalancing device includes two pivotal

coupling articulation members (86, 88) pivotally coupled
together and constrained to move parallel to respective

articulated quadrilateral devices (46, 48), one of the
pivotal coupling members (86) carrying a counterbalancing

mass (102) adjustably movable along an axis of the
articulation member (86).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the said means (64) for adjusting the direction of the

working axis (54) of the drill comprises a snap
adjustment device for effecting a movement of large

magnitude and a micrometric adjustment device for
effecting a fine adjustment.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
it includes a second pivotal coupling (82) having an axis

parallel to the working axis (54) of the drill,
interposed between the said second articulated

quadrilateral device (48) and the said attachment means
(50) for the drill (12).
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the said fixing means (16) for the support (14) comprise

a clamp (26) operable to grip a bar (24) supporting a
headrest (22) of the seat (20) and a contact pad (42)

acting against the rear surface of the seat back (18).
