<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device operating in the medium-frequency range between 1,000 and 100,000 Hz and designed for electrotherapy applications. An electrical circuit is set up through the part of the body to be treated, a medium-frequency (MF) current being passed through two electrodes. The invention calls for the amplitude of the MF current to be held constant and for the frequency to be modulated by a thousand to several thousand hertz (cut-off frequencies) at a modulation frequency of 
>
= 0 to a few hundred hertz (e.g. 200 Hz) in order to generate action potentials in the treatment area which are synchronous with the modulation frequency.

Apparatus for electrotherapeutic applications operating in the medium-frequency 
range between 1000 Hz and 100,000 Hz where, in relation to a 

body part to be treated, a circuit with a medium-frequency current (MF 
current) is applied across two electrodes, characterized in that the 

amplitude of the MF current is kept constant and the frequency is modulated 
by one thousand to several thousand Hz (corner frequencies) with 

a modulation frequency of 
>
 0 to several hundred Hz (for instance 200 
Hz) in order to generate in synchronism with the modulation frequency 

action potentials in the treatment area. 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the frequency of the medium-frequency current is adjusted to a 

level such that through the elevated intensity necessary for obtaining 
a stimulus threshold an additional generation of heat is induced. 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the corner frequencies and/or the modulation frequency, viewed 

over the treatment time, are variable. 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to one of the claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that the modulation frequency is modulated in a 

range of 
>
 0 to about 0.1 Hz.  
 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to one of the claims 1 through 
4, characterized in that two or several circuits are applied by way of 

two electrodes each, in such a way that the currents intersect in the 
treatment area, the frequency of the currents being equal or differing 

by an amount between 
>
 0 to about 200 Hz. 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in 
that a phase difference with a constant value or modulated in the range 

of 
>
 0 to about 0.1 Hz exists between the two currents. 
Electrotherapeutic apparatus according to one of the claims 1 through 6, 
characterized by its design as an apparatus for home use.
