<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to uses for silicone/fluorosilicone copolymer oil for the
manufacture of a medicament for treating
eye disorders with a liquid silicone/fluorosilicone copolymer oil that has a relatively low
tendency toward intraocular emulsification, and a specific gravity just greater than water
so that it is effective to push back and maintain in place an inferior detached retina.There have been proposed and used a number of gases and liquids for creating eye
disorders. Liquids that have been used as intraocular tools include silicone oils
(polydimethysiloxanes), fluorosilicone oils such as polymethyl-3,3,3-trifluoropropylsiloxane
and a number of perfluorocarbon liquids, for example
perfluorooctane, perfluorodecalin and perfluorophenanthrene
(perfluorotetradecahydrophenanthrene).One use of these liquids is in vitreoretinal surgery. The properties of the liquid
for such use should be that it is transparent with a refractive index close to that of the
vitreous. The substance should not mix with the vitreous, nor should it disperse or
emulsify in the vitreous. Of course it should also be chemically and physiologically
inert. To effectively act as a retinal tamponade, the substance should have a high
interfacial tension and a high surface tension.Silicone oils have been used for a number of years in vitreoretinal surgery. They
are also known to be used for treating other disorders of the eye as set forth in U.S. 
Patent Number 4,490,351, incorporated herein by reference. Silicone oil is transparent
with a refractive index of 1.404 (the refractive index of water is 1.33), and a specific
gravity of 0.97. It has a relatively high interfacial and surface tension, making it useful
as a retinal tamponade. However, because the specific gravity of silicone oil is less than
that of water, it is not useful as a tamponade for an inferior detached retina. Further, the
viscosity of the silicone oils commonly used in vitreoretinal surgery is from 1,000 to
12,000 x 10-6 M2/s. The high viscosity makes it relatively difficult to handle, requiring the
surgeon to use a silicone oil pump to pump the liquid through the needle in to and out
of the eye.Fluorosilicone oil has a higher specific gravity of 1.29 and also has a relatively
high surface and interfacial tension. The fluorosilicone oils in experimental use have a
viscosity in the same range as the silicone oil. Accordingly, they are just as difficult to
work with. An additional problem with the silicone oils and the fluorosilicone oils,
however, is their tendency
