<ABSTRACT>
There are described benzoylguanidines of the formula I 
<
IMAGE
>
 where R(1), R(3) or R(4) is -NR(6)C = XNR(7)R(8); X is oxygen or sulphur, R(6), R(7) and R(8) are H or (perfluoro)alk(en)yl, where R(7) and R(8) can also together be 4 or 5 methylene groups, and the remaining substituents R(1) to R(5) in each case are H, Hal, (fluoro)alk(en)yl, CN, NO2 or NR(16)R(17). On account of their pharmacological properties, the compounds are outstandingly suitable as antiarrhythmic medicaments having a cardioprotective component for infarct prophylaxis and infarct treatment as well as for treatment of angina pectoris, and they also preventively inhibit or greatly decrease the pathophysiological processes in the formation of ischaemically induced damage, in particular in the elicitation of ischaemically induced cardiac arrhythmias. They are obtained by reaction of a compound of the formula II 
<

 wherein L is a leaving group which can be readily nucleophilically substituted, with guanidine.
