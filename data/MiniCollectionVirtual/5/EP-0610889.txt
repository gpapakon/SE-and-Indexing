<ABSTRACT>
A "direct-to-press" diffusion transfer reversal positive lithographic printing plate and 
method for exposing same are disclosed. The "direct-to-press" printing plate provides an ink 

receiving image area and at least one ink repelling mechanical gripper area. Additionally, the 
plate can include at least one ink repelling border area. The "direct-to-press" 

printing plate 
exposure method provides direct exposure of a diffusion transfer reversal photo-lithographic 

recording substrate by a laser imagesetter using an improved method of controlling both the 
imagesetter recording beam and the movement of the recording substrate by the imagesetter. 

The imagesetter improvements allow exposure of a recording substrate in regions which 
could not previously be exposed by an imagesetter, providing a positive lithographic printing 

plate which requires no additional stripping or exposure steps after imagesetter recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a
method for producing a positive lithographic
printing plate on a web of lithographic material by a laser imagesetting device. In particular, the invention relates to
laser exposure of photo-lithographic "direct-to-plate" substrates which employ the diffusion
transfer reversal process, hereinafter called DTR, and more specifically to photo-lithographic
DTR elements suitable for exposure by gas and solid state laser wavelengths. Materials
suitable for exposure by lasers emitting in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum,
e.g. helium-neon (HeNe) or some semiconductor diode lasers, are disclosed, e.g. in US Pat.
No. 5,059,508 and US Pat. No. 4,501,811 and at least one such material is commercially
available and marketed by AGFA-GEVAERT N.V. under the trademark SETPRINT HeNe-plate
PP410. An example of a photo-lithographic DTR material suitable for laser exposure in
the infra-red region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and therefore capable of being exposed
by solid state lasers emitting at infra-red wavelengths, was announced by XENOTRON Co.
in "Ifra Newspaper Techniques" No 7 p27, as early as Oct. 1985.The diffusion transfer reversal process, as described e.g. in US Pat. No. 2,352,014, is a
photo-chemical process which through the steps of, imagewise exposure to electromagnetic
radiation and chemical processing, results in the formation of a silver image in all regions
which were exposed to electromagnetic radiation and a DTR-silver image in all regions
which were not exposed to electromagnetic radiation.In photo-lithographic "direct-to-plate" materials, the silver image and DTR-silver image
have the particular characteristics that after chemical processing, the silver image forms
water receptive ink repellent regions and the DTR-silver image forms water repellent ink
receptive regions. Thus the DTR-silver image, which is formed in areas which were not
exposed to electromagnetic radiation and which is ink receiving, is the image which is 
printed when the DTR "direct-to-plate" material is mounted on an offset press, inked and the
inked image is transferred to a printing material. The lithographic DTR printing plate is thus
a "positive plate" as defined in "Chemistry for the Graphic Arts" by P. J. Hartsuch, --Graphic
Arts Technical Foundation-- Pittsburgh, PA (1979), in that a "direct-to-plate" DTR photo-lithographic
recording substrate must be exposed in all areas for which it is desired that the
printing plate formed after chemical processing be ink repellent. The

A method for producing a positive lithographic printing
plate on a web of lithographic material in an imagesetter,

said method comprising the steps of:

(A) exposing a portion of the web of lithographic material
to produce an exposed mechanical gripper area;
(B) moving the web so that at least a part of the exposed
area is in contact with a mechanical gripper; and
(C) exposing a negative image on said web of material.
The method of claim 1 wherein the lithographic material is
photo-lithographic DTR material.
The method of claims 1 or 2 wherein the imagesetter has a
clamp for mechanically gripping the web, and wherein the

exposed mechanical gripper area of step (A) has a
configuration corresponding to the configuration of a clamp

of the imagesetter; the movement of the web in step (B)
being so that the exposed mechanical gripper area is

underneath the imagesetter clamp; and further comprising
the step of


(D) processing said exposed mechanical gripper area and
said exposed negative image.
The method of claim 3 wherein said processing in step (D)
means DTR processing.
The method of one of the preceding claims wherein said web
has a longitudinal length and a transverse width and

wherein said negative image occupies less than the
transverse width of said web, said method further comprising

the step of exposing the transverse area of the web
not occupied by said negative image. 
The method of claim 5 wherein said negative image is center
justified with respect to the transverse width of the web

and wherein the transverse areas between the image and the
edges of the web are exposed.
The method of claim 6 wherein the exposures occur in the
following sequence: mechanical gripper area, one transverse

area between one edge of the web and the negative image,
the negative image itself, and finally the other transverse

area between the other edge of the web and the negative
image.
The method of claim 5 wherein said negative image is an
image from a raster image processor and wherein the exposed

areas of the web not occupied by said negative image are
not part of a raster image processor image.
The method of one of the preceding claims further comprising
the step of forming at least one mechanical

registration aperture within said mechanical gripper area.
The method of claim 9 wherein said at least one mechanical
registration aperture is formed after producing the exposed

mechanical gripper area and prior to the exposure of the
negative image on the web of lithographic material.

image and further comprising the step of exposing another
portion of the web of lithographic material to produce

another exposed mechanical gripper area having a configuration

the clamp of the imagesetter, said another exposed
mechanical gripper area defining a footer to said negative

longitudinal length greater than the longitudinal length of
the imagesetter clamp.
The method of claim 14 wherein said footer has a longitudinal
length sufficient to form the footer for said negative

image and the header for the next succeeding negative
image.
