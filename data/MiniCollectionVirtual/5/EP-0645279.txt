<ABSTRACT>
The mobile stage is characterised by a mobile, rectangular platform with foldable wings (7) which are coupled to opposite side edges and can be pivoted out of a pivoted-up, folded-together position into a horizontal extended position, and supports for each of the inner (9) and outer (10) wing component. In order to spread out and fold together the foldable wings, rods (18) which are coupled to the base frame below the level of platform engage in an articulated fashion on the outer wing component whose length and attachment points are selected such that the outer wing component (10) rests against the inner wing component in the pivoted-up position of the foldable wing (7) and is aligned with it in the extended position. Two retractable supports of a scissor-type design are arranged on the two outer sides of the platform, the said supports bearing a beam made of lattice work on which a roof structure is arranged and having two foldable wings (33) which can be pivoted out of a pivoted-down, folded-together position into an extended position and are provided with supports for each of the inner and outer wing component.
