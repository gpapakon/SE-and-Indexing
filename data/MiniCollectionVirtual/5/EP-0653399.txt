<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the isomerisation 
of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the 
gasoline range which comprises linear paraffins having at least five 
carbon atoms. One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to produce 
gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands on product 
quality and having a high octane number. This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now to 
be established for instance without lead-containing additives, less 
aromatics, in particular benzene, and less olefins. Components which contribute to the octane quality of gasoline 
include branched paraffins. Object of the present invention is to 
provide branched paraffins, in particular branched C₇ paraffins. Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for the 
isomerisation of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling 
in the gasoline range which comprises linear paraffins having at 
least five carbon atoms by contacting the feedstock in the presence 
of hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure with a ferrierite 
catalyst which comprises at least one Group VIII metal component. In this way a very attractive high yield of branched paraffins, 
in particular C₇ paraffins predominantly existing of mono-branched 
C₇ paraffins, can be obtained. The mono-branched C₇ paraffins 
obtained in accordance with the present process can as such suitably 
be applied for the production of multi-branched C₇ paraffins, which 
constitute even more attractive high octane gasoline components. Suitably, the ferrierite catalyst to be applied has a SiO₂/Al₂O₃ 
molar ratio up to 120, preferably from 15 to 100. Preferably, the ferrierite catalyst to be applied in accordance 
with the present invention is substantially in its hydrogen form. It should be noted that in the context of the present invention 
the term ferrierite catalyst includes apart from ferrierite as such  
 
other tectometallosilicates having a ferrierite structure. Such 
tectometallosilicates include FU-9, ISI-6, Nu-23, ZSM-21, ZSM-35 and 
ZSM-38. However, ferrierite as such is preferred. The hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the 
gasoline range can suitably be obtained by fractionating any 
paraffinic gasoline-containing hydrocarbonaceous feedstock. 
Preferably the feedstock substantially boiling in the gasoline range 
is obtained by subjecting a straight run hydrocarbon oil to a 
fractionation, preferably atmospheric distillation. Other suitable 
hydrocarbonaceous
