<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for keeping separated the 
gas atmospheres, for instance at the location of a passage 

opening in a building, comprising of forming a gas curtain, 
such as an air curtain, between the gas atmospheres, wherein 

the gas curtain is composed of a number of parallel gas 
flows which extend adjacently of each other. The gas curtain 

is composed of at least three gas flows with the same speed 
and direction which are differently conditioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for keeping
separated the gas atmospheres on either side of an
opening according to the introductory part of claim 1.Such a method is known from US-A-3 211 078. The
two parallel gas flows mix only with great difficulty,
whereby little mixing occurs at the position of the
interface and the gas flow therefore retains its energy
and composition for a relatively long time. Accordingly,
a rather good separation of the two atmospheres is
obtained.The invention has for its object to provide a
method as set forth above, in which the separation of the
two atmospheres on either side of an opening is further
effectively improved.This is obtained with the method according to
the invention, having the characterizing features of
claim 1. The intermediate gas flow or flows is or are
bounded on either side by parallel gas flows so that this
intermediate gas flow(s) can extend practically
undisturbed to the opposite end of for example the
passage opening. A very good separation of the gas
atmospheres is hereby obtained on both sides.Preferably the step of claim 2 is applied
herein. The outer gas flows form "protective" gas flows
for the inner gas flow or flows. Turbulence and
intermixing occur at the interfaces between the outer gas
flows and the adjacent gas atmospheres, although this has
no adverse effect on the energy content and composition
of the inner gas flow or flows. This remains or these
remain practically undisturbed. Claim 4 gives an exceptionally suitable
application of the method according to the invention. It
is hereby possible to keep a deep-freeze area with a
temperature in the order of magnitude of -20°C
effectively separated from the outside atmosphere with a
temperature for instance of +20°C. Due to the low
temperature the air in the deep-freeze area contains only
very little moisture in the absolute sense. By forming
the at least one intermediate gas flow from heated air
extracted from the deep-freeze area, this intermediate
gas flow thus acquires a very low relative humidity. This
prevents moisture from condensing in the interface
between the outer gas flow adjoining the outside
atmosphere and the inner gas flow adjacent thereto, so
that mist formation is prevented in effective manner.The invention likewise relates to and provides a gas
curtain device as characterized in claim 6. Favourable
embodiments of the gas curtain device according to the
invention are characterized in the further sub-claims. The invention will be further elucidated in the
following

<CLAIMS>
Method for keeping separated the gas
atmospheres on either side (1, 2) of an opening (3),

extending transversely to a closed surface, such as floor
surface, comprising of forming a gas curtain, such as an

air curtain across said opening and directed to said
closed surface, comprising of two parallel gas flows (5,

7) having the same speed and direction and which are
differently conditioned, 
characterized in that
 the air
curtain comprises at least one intermediate gas flow (6)

extending in between and parallel to the two gas flows
(5, 7) and having substantially the same speed as the two

gas flows. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
outer gas flows (5, 7) each have the same conditioning as

the directly adjoining gas atmosphere (1, 2).
Method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
outer gas flows (5, 7) are formed from gas extracted

directly from the adjoining gas atmospheres (1, 2).
Method as claimed in claim 3 for keeping
separated the atmosphere in a deep-freeze area (1) and an

outside atmosphere (2), wherein the at least one
intermediate gas flow (6) is conditioned such that

condensation forming on the interface with the outer gas
flow (5) formed from air extracted from the atmosphere in

the deep-freeze area (1) is prevented.
Method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the at
least one intermediate gas flow (6) is formed from heated

air extracted from the deep-freeze area (1).
Gas curtain device comprising gas
transporting means having at least two gas blow-out

members (12, 14) extending mutually parallel and
adjacently for generating two parallel gas flows (5, 7)

with substantially the same speed and comprising mounting
means for mounting the gas blow-out members adjacent a

wall opening (3) 
characterized by
 at least one
intermediate gas blow-out member (13) arranged in between

and parallel to the two gas blow-out members (12, 14) for
generating at least one intermediate gas flow (6) in

between and parallel to the two parallel gas flows (5, 7)
and with substantially the same speed and direction. 
Gas curtain device as claimed in claim 6,
comprising gas conditioning means for conditioning at

least one of the gas flows (5, 6, 7).
Gas curtain device as claimed in either of
the claims 6 or 7 for keeping separated the atmosphere in

a deep-freeze area (1) and an outside atmosphere (2),
wherein the gas conditioning means comprise heating means

in a gas duct leading to the at least one intermediate
gas blow-out member (13).
Gas curtain device as claimed in any of the
claims 6-8, wherein the gas transporting means are

dimensioned and adjusted such that the generated parallel
gas flows (5, 6, 7) have the same speed and direction.
