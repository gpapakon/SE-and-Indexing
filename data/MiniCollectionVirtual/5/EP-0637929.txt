<ABSTRACT>
A dishwasher comprises a dishwashing tank (1) with a compartment (10) for receiving articles to be washed (2), and a magazine (3, 4) provided below this compartment for receiving washing liquid and blasting agent. The washing liquid and the blasting agent have different densities. Between the magazine and the compartment extends a conduit (5, 9, 11) in which a pump (6) is connected for delivering washing liquid and blasting agent under elevated pressure to a nozzle arrangement (8) mounted at the conduit end disposed in the compartment receiving the articles to be washed. Washing liquid and blasting agent discharged from the nozzle arrangement impinge upon the articles to be washed, to subsequently drop into the magazine via an outlet (13) from the compartment. A partition (12) divides the magazine into a first chamber (3) situated straight below the outlet (13) from the compartment (10) and adapted to receive washing liquid and blasting agent, and a second chamber (4) situated beside the outlet and communicating with the first chamber via a passage (14) which, owing to the different densities of the washing liquid and the blasting agent, permits only washing liquid to flow from the first chamber to the second chamber. The suction side of the pump is connected to the second chamber. A means (7) for supplying blasting agent is connected between the first chamber (3) and the conduit (9) in order to supply blasting agent to the washing liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dishwasher
as defined in the preamble of claims 1 and 8, respectively.Heavy-duty dishwashers, primarily used in catering
departments, are long since known, and are based on the
idea of spraying under high presure a mixture of washing
water and blasting agent towards the articles to be
washed. The cleaning principle of the machine is as
follows. First, the articles to be washed are fixed in a
suitable device in the washing compartment. The washing
process is begun by a pump pumping washing water with
no blasting agent added. When the washing water has
attained a suitable pressure and flow, blasting agent is
added by the pump drawing a mixture of washing water and
blasting agent from a magazine provided straight below
the washing compartment. After washing, the pump draws
only washing water for rinsing the washed articles, e.g.
by sucking water from an elevated level in the tank, where
the comparatively heavy blasting agent is not present.
After rinsing with the washing water in the magazine, the
articles are rinsed with fresh water to which a minor
amount of a rinsing agent/drying agent has been added.
When the whole washing operation is completed, the washing 
water is in most cases conducted to a strainer means for
separating the blasting agent bodies from the washing
water and collecting them in the lower part of the
magazine to be used once more in the subsequent washing
operation.
Such background art is known from SE-B-464 387 on which the
preamble of claim 1 is based. Other relevant background art is
known from US-A-1 761 492 on which the preamble of claim 8 is
based.Prior-art heavy-duty dishwashers suffer from the
drawback that the tank or magazine for receiving washing
water and blasting agent from the dishwashing compartment
is located straight below this compartment. This produces
turbulence in the magazine, which in turn may cause the
pump to draw air and thus make the dishwasher operate
irregularly. Further, it is difficult to control the
amount of blasting agent in the washing water pumped
through the conduit to the nozzle arrangement in the dish-washing
compartment. Neither is it possible to increase
the amount or the degree of admixture of blasting agent
while maintaining the capacity of the pump. Today's heavy-duty
dishwashers have a tendency to attain only a 90%
cleaning degree during the time at disposal. The normal
washing time in a dishwashing programme is about 5 min. In
order to obtain a 100% cleaning degree, that time would
have to be prolonged to
