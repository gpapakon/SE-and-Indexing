<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prostatic stent
comprising an elongate body which defines a passage therethrough,
and the invention also covers processes for the
manufacture of such prostatic stent made of a metallic material.
Such stents corresponding to the preamble of claim 1
are known c.f. from EP-A-0481365 or EP-A-0183372.Thus, the invention more specifically relates to a
prostatic stent for non-surgical treatment of obstruction
of prostatic urethra, such as may arise in connection with
benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatic carcinoma.A commonly occurring disorder in urology is the obstruction
of prostatic urethra. The disorder occurs in
males due to enlargement of the prostatic gland, due to
either hyperplasia or cancer. A condition often found in
older males is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), and said condition can cause a plurality of inconvenient
symptoms, such as difficulties to urinate, strongly
reduced capacity to urinate, and the condition may at
times result in complete retention of urine which may lead
to severe renal disorders.The traditional procedure for treating problems associated
with enlargement of the prostate gland has up to
now been surgery constituted by cutting away interior sections
of the prostate gland or complete surgical removal
of the prostate. These are, however, procedures unfavoured
by many patients and there has been a search for alternative
ways of dealing with the problem.US patent 5,059,169 is an example of such alternative
to surgery. Said patent discloses a prostatic stent provided
with a conical flange disposed within the neck of
the bladder, the opposite end of the stent body extending
approximately to the verumontanum. The stent is provided
with a textured exterior surface that frictionally engages 
the urethral walls to prevent migration of the stent into
the bladder. Migration in the opposite direction is prevented
by the conical flange.However, this prior art high-friction prostatic stent
is associated with disadvantages, in particular at and
around the conical flange disposed within the neck of the
bladder due to the fact that said end of the stent does
not conform to the bladder neck in view of the fact that
the proximal end of the stent is designed perpendicular to
a center line of the body of the stent. This design means
that the stent cannot be placed optimally to cover the
complete bladder neck. Either it causes urinary stones
(calculi, encrustation) to form on the device protruding
into the bladder or the device does not

A prostatic stent having an elongate body (13)
defining a passage therethrough, and comprising a proximal

section (21), a mid-section (19) having a substantially
constant cross-section along said mid-section, and

a distal section (17) characterized in that said proximal
section (21) has a flaring and oblique proximal end (23)

conforming both radially and axially to the walls of the
surrounding bladder neck (3), and that said elongate body

(13) has a length sufficient to extend distally from a
bladder neck (3) to a position somewhat short of the external

sphincter (9).
A prostatic stent according to claim 1, wherein
the proximal end (23) of said proximal section (21) extends

in a plane (P) sloping at an angle (α) to a normal
(N) to a center line (L) of said body (13) not exceeding

about 50°.
A prostatic stent according to claim 2, wherein
said angle (α) lies within a range of about 5 to about

40°.
A prostatic stent according to claim 3, wherein
said angle (α) lies within a range of about 10 to about

30°.
A prostatic stent according to any preceding
claim, wherein said distal section (17) of the body (13)

has a distally directed taper so as not to interfere with
the sphincter function.
A prostatic stent according to any preceding
claim, wherein said body (13) has an approximately circular

radial cross-section.
A prostatic stent according to any of claims 1 to
5, wherein said body (13) has a non-circular radial

cross-section for improved conformation to the surrounding
urethral wall. 
A prostatic stent according to claim 10, wherein
said non-circular radial cross-section has a flattened or

oval shape.
A prostatic stent according to any preceding
claim, which is of a self-expandable type.
A prostatic stent according to claim 9, which is
of the braided type comprising a flexible tubular body

which has a diameter that is variable by axial novement
of the ends of the body relative to each other and which

is composed of several individual rigid but flexible
thread elements each of which extends in helix configuration

with the center line of the body as a common axis, a
number of elements having the same direction of winding

but being axially displaced relative to each other crossing
a number of elements also axially displaced relative

to each other but having the opposite direction of winding.

said proximal end (23) of said body (13) extends in a

plane that is substantially parallel to the oppositely
extending filaments in the stent.

the surrounding bladder neck (3), further comprising a

mid-section (19) having a substantially constant cross-section
along said mid-section, and a distal section

(17), said process comprising preparing a braided hollow,
deformable body having substantially straight cylindrical

walls, characterized by

a) mounting the deformable body onto a mandrel with
a shape corresponding to the above defined particular desired shape of the finished

stent; 
b) applying energy or external pressure or both onto
said body positioned on said mandrel to cause said body

to conform to the shape of the mandrel;
c) removing the thus shaped body from the mandrel;
and
d) cutting the proximal end (23) to the desired
obliqueness.
