<ABSTRACT>
A triple-effect absorption heat exchange apparatus is disclosed for transferring heat from a heat load (12) to a heat sink (14). The apparatus comprises first and second interconnected refrigerant loops. The first loop comprises a first generator (26), a first condenser (40), a first evaporator (16), and a first absorber (24) operatively linked together. The second loop comprises a second generator (32), a second condenser (50), a second evaporator (44), and a second absorber (46) operatively linked together. The first absorber (24) and the first condenser (40) are in direct heat exchange relation with the second generator (32). This direct heat exchange relation may be established by providing a two part generator in which the condenser (40) and absorber (24) of a first loop are in the same chamber (70) as the generator (32) of a second loop. The condenser (40) and absorber (24) of the first loop provide the heat necessary to operate the second loop generator (32). The preferred second loop generator (32) comprises a first chamber (70) divided by a heat-conductive media providing the heat exchange. At least one conduit is partitioned having the second chamber (40) adjacent to its entrance and the third chamber (24) adjacent to its exit. A second conduit is unobstructed and passes through the second (40) and third (24) chamber. Multiple conduits can be incorporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to absorption heat 
exchange apparatus for removing heat from a heat load to a heat 
sink, and particularly to plural-loop absorption heat exchange 
apparatus. Absorption refrigeration, chilling, heat pump, and related 
apparatus employing a composite refrigerant and a single 
refrigeration loop is well known. The refrigeration loop 
includes a generator, a condenser, an evaporator, and an 
absorber. A variety of composite refrigerant systems can be 
used in such apparatus. Two examples are an ammonia/water 
system and a lithium bromide/water system. Heat from an external source of energy is added to the 
composite refrigerant in the generator. The generator heats 
the composite liquid refrigerant sufficiently to distill out a 
vapor of the more volatile component or phase of the 
refrigerant (for example, ammonia vapor in the case cf the 
ammonia/water refrigerant and water in the case of the lithium 
bromide/water system), leaving a less-volatile component or 
phase of the refrigerant behind. The less-volatile refrigerant 
component can either be more concentrated than the composite 
refrigerant (as when water vapor is distilled out of an aqueous 
lithium bromide solution) or more dilute than the initial 
refrigerant (as when ammonia is driven out cf water solution). 
The remaining less-volatile refrigerant component is removed to 
the absorber. The condenser receives the vapor phase of the refrigerant 
from the generator and condenses it to liquid form (also known 
as a condensate). The heat released by the condensation of the 
vapor is rejected to a cooling tower, cooling water, some other 
external heat sink, or another stage of the refrigeration 
apparatus.  
 The evaporator withdraws heat from a heat load (i.e. the 
building air, refrigerator contents, cooling water, or other 
fluid or object the system is designed to cool) by evaporating 
the condensed liquid refrigerant in direct or indirect contact 
with the heat load. The evaporator thus re-vaporizes the 
volatile refrigerant component. The absorber contacts the refrigerant vapor component 
leaving the evaporator with the less-volatile refrigerant 
component leaving the generator. The contacting process 
generates heat when the vapor phase is reabsorbed into the 
less-volatile refrigerant phase. This heat is rejected to a 
cooling tower, cooling water, another stage of the 
refrigeration apparatus, or some other heat sink. The original 
composite refrigerant is re-formed in the absorber, and then is 
returned
