<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant restraint air bag module (10) 
includes a module housing and a retaining bracket which 

have complementary concave portions between which a 
generally circular or toroidal inflator (12) is clamped. A 

folded inflatable air bag (18) is accommodated under a 
cover (20) having a groove (74) engaged by an outwardly 

rolled over lip of the module housing. Nuts on bolts 
extending outwardly from an annular air bag retaining ring 

through holes in contacting planar portions of the module 
housing and the retaining bracket clamp these parts 

together and also clamp a portion of the air bag adjacent 
an inlet aperture between the retaining ring and the module 

housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air bag module for use 
on the driver side of automotive and other vehicles 
wherein an inflatable air bag or cushion is inflated in 
the event of a collision to protect the driver from 
injury that could result from being forcibly thrown 
against the steering wheel, dashboard, etc. The air bag 
module uses a toroidal hybrid inflator assembly. Pyrotechnic inflator assemblies that currently are 
in use in driver side air bag modules, as disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. application for patent bearing Serial 
No. 07/820,826, filed January 15, 1992 by Gary V. Adams 
and Bradley W. Smith, typically are toroidal types 
having relatively flat disk-like shapes that include a 
flange. The modules currently produced use the flange 
of the toroidal inflator to attach it to the module 
housing.  Inflator assemblies of the toroidal type, as 
disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. application for 
patent bearing Serial No. 07/820,826, produce a cushion 
inflating gas source from a combustible gas generating 
material which, upon ignition, generates a quantity of 
gas sufficient to inflate the cushion. In another form 
of toroidal inflator assembly, the cushion inflating 
gas results from a combination of stored compressed gas 
and a gas generating material, as disclosed, for 
example, in German patent Off. 2443 267 and in U.S. 
Patents 3,901,530 and 5,199,740. The latter form of 
toroidal inflator assembly is commonly referred to as a 
toroidal augmented gas or hybrid inflator. A toroidal 
hybrid inflator affects the performance of an air bag 
module in several ways including variation in the 
amount of stored gas, the transmission of heat to the 
stored gas, and the rate at which the inflating gas is 
dispensed into the inflatable cushion. The toroidal hybrid inflator is characterized in 
that it does not have a flange to attach it to the air 
bag module. There is thus a need and a demand to devise 
another method to attach the toroidal hybrid inflator to 
an air bag module thereby to eliminate the need for a 
flange to be welded thereto. The present invention was 
devised to fill the technological gap that has existed 
in the art in these respects. An object of the invention is to provide an air bag 
module for the driver side of an automotive or other 
vehicle which module uses a toroidal inflator assembly 
that is so clamped in the module that a flange is not 
needed, there being no change in the external appearance 
and function of the module and with only the internal 
components of
