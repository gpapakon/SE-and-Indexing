<ABSTRACT>
There has been provided by the present invention a 
process for producing a single crystal of potassium niobate 

which comprises disposing a positive electrode directly or 
via a semi-insulating substance layer on one c-plane of a 

single crystal of potassium niobate and also a negative 
electrode via a semi-insulating substance layer on the 

other c-plane of the single crystal of potassium niobate, 
said positive and negative electrodes being disposed in 

mutually facing relationship, and applying voltage between 
the positive and negative electrodes so as to poll (convert 

to the single-domain state) the single crystal of potassium 
niobate, and which enables to poll the entire region of the 

single crystal of potassium niobate without quality 
deterioration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a single crystal of potassium niobate employed as
an optical element, such as a wavelength conversion element
or a light modulation element.The single crystal of potassium niobate (KNbO3) is now
attracting attention as a nonlinear optical material or an
electro-optical material. Especially, its capability of
converting semiconductor laser beams being monochromatic
rays of about 860 or 980 nm to 1/2 higher harmonics is so
high that the utilization thereof as a nonlinear optical
material is attracting intense attention.The single crystal of potassium niobate may be
obtained by heating a powdery mixture of potassium
carbonate and niobium oxide (Nb2O5) at 1050°C or higher to
thereby melt the same, implanting seed crystals in the melt
and gradually cooling the melt so as to attain crystal
growth, as described in T. Fukuda and Y. Uematu, J.J.A.P.
11 (1973) 163. During the cooling of the formed single
crystal of potassium niobate, a structural phase transition
from the cubic system to the tetragonal system occurs at
about 420°C, and another structural phase transition from 
the tetragonal system to the rhombic system occurs at about
210°C. At room temperature, the single crystal of
potassium niobate being of the rhombic system and being in
the poly-domain state, is obtained.In the use of the single crystal of potassium niobate
as an optical element, such as a wavelength conversion
element or a light modulation element, conventionally, the
single crystal of potassium niobate is subjected to the
treatment for conversion to the single-domain state, i.e.,
polling treatment. Referring to Fig. 5, this polling
treatment comprises respectively forming a positive
electrode 2 and a negative electrode 3 on the c-plane 5 and
the c-plane 6 of the single crystal of potassium niobate 1
by coating with a conductive paste containing conductive
powder such as silver or carbon powder or by vacuum
evaporation of gold or the like and subsequently applying
an electric field of at least 1 kV/cm between the positive
and negative electrodes 2, 3 sandwiching the single crystal
of potassium niobate 1 at about 200°C.In this specification, the poly-domain state refers to
a state in which a plurality of, or multiple adjacent
domains having mutually different polarization directions
are formed. The conversion of the poly-domain state to the
single-domain state in which the polarization directions
are uniformly arranged, is referred to as polling.However, the above conventional polling
