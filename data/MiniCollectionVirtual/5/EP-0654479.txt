<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to esculetin derivatives
and a method for manufacture thereof, a use thereof, and a
pharmaceutical composition, more particularly an agent for
protecting cartilage, i.e., a chondroprotective agent. The
esculetin derivatives of the present invention can be
administered effectively, for example, to mammals suffering
from arthropathy.There are various types of arthropathy, for example,
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, and osteoarthritis.
Many people particularly suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis, and these diseases are considered the major
types of arthropathy. There are congenital and secondary
osteoarthritis, and further primary osteoarthritis caused by
degeneration of the articular cartilage along with aging.
Patients suffering from primary osteoarthritis have recently
been increasing along with the increase in the population of
the aged. Therefore, development of medicines for its
treatment having new actions and functions is desired.Although there are considerable differences of the
causes and conditions between rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis, the articular function becomes eventually
obstructed by the destruction of the cartilage in both of
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.The first choice of medicines for treatment of
rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic
fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, or osteoarthritis are
analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents, for example, aspirin
or indomethacin. Further, gold compounds (for example,
Shiosol), immunomodulators, steroids, or D-penicillamine are
used as the medicine for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.The above conventional analgesic and anti-inflammatory
agents, however, were not effective against the destruction of 
the articular cartilage, and in fact, sometimes exhibited
adverse effect in the experiments using chondrocytes. Further,
clinically, no function to suppress the destruction of
articular cartilage was found in the above medicines for
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.The articular cartilage is composed of chondrocytes
and the cartilage matrix. The cartilage matrix has a three-dimensional
structure which is formed by non-covarently
binding the type II collagen, which is the fibrous protein
produced by the chondrocytes, and the glycoprotein complex,
proteoglycan, with hyaluronic acid to cause complicated
entanglement. The matrix holds a large amount of water, which
enables the normal articular functions to be maintained. The
