<ABSTRACT>
For changing the volume of the airflow into a room, there is proposed a device with a flap (4) which is pivotable about a shaft (3). The flap (4) is equipped with a carrying arm (7) which is fitted with a displaceable weight (8). Whereas the flap (4) is pivotable through an acute angle  phi , the carrying arm (7) with the weight (8) can pivot through an angle  phi  +  phi 1. On the basis of the characteristic curve, the flap (4) opens and closes automatically, given appropriate differential pressures and acting flow forces. Depending on the angular position of the carrying arm (7) with respect to the flap (4) and depending on the position of the weight (8) with respect to the shaft (3), the flap (4) opens at a differential pressure  DELTA pmax. Owing to the mass inertia, the flap (4) swings open, the pivoting movement of the carrying arm (7) additionally through the angle  phi 1 accelerating the opening and preventing undesired states of equilibrium in intermediate positions of the flap (4).
