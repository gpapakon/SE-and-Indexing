<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antifoam
composition that exhibits excellent and long-lasting
performance under strong alkaline conditions.Antifoam compositions derived from silicone
oils, such as diorganopolysiloxanes, exhibit activites
superior to that of antifoams based on other materials,
and do so at smaller quantities of addition for
silicone based compositions. Consequently, they are in
wide use for breaking or suppressing foam in industries
such as chemicals, foods, petroleum products, textiles,
plastics, cements, paints and adhesives. However,
under strongly alkaline conditions,
diorganopolysiloxane based antifoam compositions
experience a decline in both the level and persistence
of their antifoam activity. This often necessitates a
continuous or intermittent addition of more antifoam
composition.Numerous antifoams have been proposed to
solve this problem. For example, Japanese Patent
Publication [Kokai] 56-48211; Japanese Patent
Publication 59-69110; Japanese Patent Publication
4-42042; Japanese Patent Publication 4-42043 and
Japanese Patent Publication 5-184814.However, under strongly alkaline conditions,
these silicone antifoam compositions exhibit an
unsatisfactory antifoam activity and a reduced
persistence due to scission of the main chain of the
organopolysiloxane in such compositions.The present invention provides an antifoam
composition comprising (A) 100 weight parts of an
organosilicon polymer having the general formula: 

wherein R1 denotes a monovalent hydrocarbon group free
of aliphatic unsaturation, R2 is selected from hydrogen
atom, monovalent hydrocarbon groups, and hydroxyl
groups, R3 denotes an alkylene group, m has a value of
at least 2, n has a value of zero or greater with the
proviso that m is greater than or equal to n, and (B)
from 1 to 50 weight parts of a silica having a specific
surface area of at least 50 m2/g.This composition of the present invention
surprisingly produces an antifoam composition that
exhibits an excellent and long-lasting antifoam
activity under strongly alkaline conditions.The organosilicon polymer (A) is the
principal agent of the antifoam composition of the
present invention, and has the general formula:

   R1 denotes monovalent hydrocarbon groups free
of aliphatic unsaturation. It is exemplified by
monovalent hydrocarbon groups, such as methyl, ethyl,
propyl, and butyl; aryl groups, such as phenyl, tolyl,
and xylyl; and aralkyl groups, such as benzyl and
phenethyl. Preferred R1 groups are methyl and phenyl.
R2 denotes a group selected
