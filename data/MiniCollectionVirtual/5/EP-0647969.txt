<ABSTRACT>
A first contact hole (39a) for a bit line is formed 
in an interlayer insulating film (39), and a
 polysilicon 
film (40) is formed on the inner surface of the contact 

hole (39a) and on the interlayer insulating film (39). 
Subsequently, the polysilicon film (40) is subjected to 

isotropic dry etching using a resist (43) as a mask, and 
the interlayer insulating film (39) is subjected to RIE 

etching, thereby forming a second contact hole (39b) in 
the interlayer insulating film (39) in a peripheral 

circuit region (31b). Then, a laminated film (44) containing a metal is 
formed on the inner surface of the second contact hole 

(39b) and on the polysilicon film (40), and the second 
contact hole (39b) is filled with a filling member (45). 

The laminated film (44) and the polysilicon film (40) 
are patterned, thereby forming a bit line (46) in a 

memory cell region (31a). 
The laminated film (44) contacts the silicon substrate directly in 
the second contact hole (39b), thereby forming a silicide and resulting 

in a contact of very low resistance. In the first contact hole (39a) the 
firstly deposited polysilicon film (40) prevents a silicidation of the 

substrate and therefore a P
n
 failure in a memory 
cell region, where dimensions of 

transistors are smaller than in a peripheral region.
