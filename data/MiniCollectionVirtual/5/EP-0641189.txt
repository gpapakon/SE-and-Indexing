<DESCRIPTION>
 Cosmetic CompositionsTechnical Field The present invention relates to skin- and hair-care cosmetic compositions. In particular it relates to cosmetic compositions in the form of aqueous gels or lotions which provide improved moisturization, skin feel and skin care benefits, reduced tack and residue characteristics together with excellent visual clarity, rub-in and absorption characteristics.Background of the Invention Skin is made up of several layers of cells which coat and protect the keratin and collagen fibrous proteins that form the skeleton of its structure. The outermost of these layers, referred to as the stratum corneum, is known to be composed of 25nm protein bundles surrounded by 8nm thick layers. Anionic surfactants and organic solvents typically penetrate the stratum corneum membrane and, by delipidization (i.e. removal of the lipids from the stratum corneum), destroy its integrity. This destruction of the skin surface topography leads to a rough feel and may eventually permit the surfactant or solvent to interact with the keratin, creating irritation.It is now recognised that maintaining the proper water gradient across the stratum corneum is important to its functionality. Most of this water, which is sometimes considered to be the stratum corneum's plasticizer, comes from inside the body. If the humidity is too low, such as in a cold climate, insufficient water remains in the outer layers of the stratum corneum to properly plasticize the tissue, and the skin begins to scale and becomes itchy. Skin permeability is also decreased somewhat when there is inadequate water across the stratum corneum. On the other hand, too much water on the outside of the skin causes the stratum corneum to ultimately sorb three to five times its own weight of bound water. This swells and puckers the skin and results in approximately a two to three fold increase in the permeability of the skin to water and other polar molecules.Hair consists of many of the same constituents as the stratum corneum. The outermost region of cells forms a rather thick chemically resistant protective coating enclosing the hair fibre which is called the cuticle. The surface of the cuticle is covered with a thin layer called the epicuticle which is thought to 

contain lipids and protein. The cuticle envelopes the cortex cells which comprise the major part of the fibre mass. Keratinization takes place in the cortex to build stability into the hair structure.Thus, a need exists for compositions which will assist the stratum corneum
