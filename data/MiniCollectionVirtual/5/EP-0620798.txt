Conveyor for the transportation of preferably electrical components (5) 
the (conveyor) having a closed loop forming transport means guided by at least 

two deflection wheels (14, 15) as well as holders (28) arranged on this to 
contain the components (5) whereby the transport means is a metal band on 

which the holder (28) accommodating supports (26, 26a) are arranged, 
characterised in that the supports (26, 26a) are arranged on the outer side of the 

metal bands (23) with respect to the loop and each are held from the inside by 
at least a holding element (27, 39), which with an area formed convexly around 

an axis perpendicular to the transport direction (A) as well as parallel to the 
band upper surface lies closely against the inner surface of the metal band (23). 
Conveyor according to claim 1 characterised in that the holders (28) are 
movably provided on the supports (26, 26a). 
Conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the metal 
band (23) is a steel band. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the 
holders are grippers. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that at least 
one guide rail (33, 47) for the supports (26, 26a), itself not moving with the  

 
transport band (13), as well as a vacuum distributor canal (34, 49) formed in 

this for the holder formed as a vacuum holder (28) are provided. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the 
supports (26, 26a) fit closely to one another perpendicular to the plane 

containing the transport direction (A) at least during their linear movement. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that the 
holding element (27, 39) against the inner surface of the metal band (23) 

adjacent area is convexly formed around an axis perpendicular to the transport 
direction as well as parallel to the band upper surface. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that the 
holding element (27, 39) is curved convexly. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that the 
convexly curved against the inner surface of the metal band (23) located area of 

each holding element is formed from a pin or barrel element (27) held in a 
projection (25) of a support (26). 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that the 
holding element is formed from a stud or a screw (39) with a head (41) which 

is formed convexly on an inner surface (43) and fits closely against the inner 
surface of the metal band (23). 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in that the 
metal band (23) for the production of a continuous band is provided at both  

 
ends, each with a support (26, 26a) and that both the supports (26, 26a) are 

connected with one another through a bracket like length (23') of a preferably 
of the same metal band. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that the 
holding elements (27, 39) for the supports (26, 26a) engage in recesses (35) of 

at least one deflection wheel (14, 15). 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in that on at 
least one deflection wheel (14, 15), index pins (37) project which engage in 

perforation openings of the metal band (23). 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in that on 
each support (26a) several, preferably two, holders (28) are provided. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in that the 
conveyor is a component of an apparatus for the processing and treating of 

electrical components (5) which has at least a supply station (16) to which the 
components (5) are delivered, each one after the other, on the holder (28) itself 

clocked and moving by this station as well as at least a delivery or removal 
station (21, 22) for the components. 
Conveyor according to one of claims 5 to 15 characterised in that the 
guide rail (47) having the vacuum distributor canal (49) is provided on the 

inner side of the metal band (23) opposite the supports (26, 26a) and forms for 
this inner side of the metal band (23) a guide surface (48), that the vacuum 

distributor canal (49) has a side open to the metal band (23) which is covered  
 

by the metal band (23) and that the vacuum distributor canal (49) through at 
least an opening or a channel (45) in the steel band (23) and/or in the holding 

element (39) remains in connection with the vacuum holder (28) or a channel 
(28') thereformed.
