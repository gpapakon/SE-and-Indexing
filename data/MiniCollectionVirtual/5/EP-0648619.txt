<ABSTRACT>
Marking apparatus for moving a marking head (20) to coordinate positions utilizing two 
fixed stepper motors (210,216) performing in conjunction with a cable (256,296) and pulley drive system. The 

dynamics of pneumatically driven marrker pins within marker heads are accommodated for by 
a topology which includes a marker support base (40) which, in turn, is supported in force transfer 

relationship with an air bearing (80) which rides over a flat platen surface (42). Improved marker head 
structure is developed utilizing a polyetherimide material and a design providing the 

introduction of return air into a two-component piston chamber at a location above a seating 
surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
As industry has continued to refine and improve production techniques and procedures,
corresponding requirements have been levied for placing identifying, data related markings
upon components of manufactured assemblies. With such marking, the history of a product
may be traced throughout the stages of its manufacture and components of complex machinery
such as automobiles and the like may be identified, for example, in the course of investigations
by governmental authorities.A variety of product marking approaches have been employed by industry. For
example, paper tags or labels carrying bar codes may be applied to components in the course of
their assembly. For many applications, such tags or labels will be lost or destroyed. Ink or
paint spraying of codes such as dot matrix codes have been employed for many manufacturing
processes. Where the production environment is too rigorous, however, or subsequent
painting steps are involved, such an approach has been found to be unacceptable.The provision of a permanent or traceable marking upon hard surfaces such as metal
traditionally has been achieved with marking punches utilizing dies which carry a collection of
fully formed characters. These "full face dies" may be positioned in a wheel or ball form of die
carrier which is manipulated to define a necessarily short message as it is dynamically struck
into the material to be marked. As is apparent, the necessarily complex mechanisms involved
are prone to failure and full face dies exhibit rapid wear. Generally, the legibility and abrasion
resistance of the resultant marks can be considered to be only fair in quality. Additionally, the
marking punch approach is considered a poor performer in marking such surfaces as epoxy
coatings and the like.Laser activated marking systems have been employed. However, such systems are of
relatively higher cost and the abrasion resistance and "readability after painting" characteristics
of laser formed characters are considered somewhat poor.U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,999 by Robertson, issued in 1985, entitled "Program Controlled
Pin Matrix Embossing Apparatus" describes and claims a computer driven dot matrix marking
technique which has been successful in the marketplace. This marking approach employs an
array of tool steel punches which are uniquely driven using a pneumatic floating pin impact
concept to generate man readable and/or machine readable dot characters or codes. Marketed
under the trade designation "PINSTAMP", these devices carry the noted steel punches or
"pins" in
