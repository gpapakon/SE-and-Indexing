<ABSTRACT>
A reference picture element extraction circuit 
constitutes a detection circuit detecting whether an 

image is a character image or a dot image together with 
a primary scanning direction edge detection circuit and 

a secondary scanning direction edge detection circuit. 
In general, a character image has continuous edges in 

which a boundary with a large density difference continues 
for two or more picture elements in the primary and the 

secondary scanning directions, while the dot image is a 
dot drawing and characterized by a very small number of 

continuous edges in picture elements in the primary or 
secondary scanning direction. An image identification 

circuit uses this characteristic to identify a character 
image or a dot image by detecting whether or not there 

are continuous edges in a matrix extracted from picture 
signals, and selects binary conversion (e.g. thresholding for 

characters, dithering for dot images) 
suitable for the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing 
device and method for determining an image area and, more 
particularly, to the device and method for determining 
whether an image is a character image or another type 
of image. In general, an image processing device such as a 
facsimile device or a phototelegraphic device generates 
a pictorial signal by scanning a document in which 
photo images, character images, and dot images are mixed; 
converts it to binary signals 0 and 1; and codes them. 
However, in the process of binary signal conversion, 
if the image is converted to binary signals 0 and 1 in 
exactly the same way regardless of the type of image, 
the coding efficiency drops and image reproducibility 
deteriorates. Thus, the conventional image processing 
device solves such problems by determining the type of 
image, and generating binary signals with methods suitable 
for the respective images. In relation to the image processing technique for 
determining the type of image, USP 4,547,811 discloses  
 
a method for distinguishing a binary image from an image 
with gray levels, such as a photograph. The method 
performs the following determination by dividing a 
document into blocks each composed of m x n picture 
elements, detecting the maximum density level Lmax and 
the minimum density level Lmin of picture signal levels 
in the blocks, and comparing them with a reference value P. 
i) The image in a block is a character image
 
   if Lmax - Lmin > P, and ii) The image in a block is a photo image
 
   if Lmax - Lmin ≦ P. However, while the above method is effective in 
distinguishing a photo image whose density level 
continuously varies and a character image, it is not 
effective in distinguishing a dot image which is dot 
drawing and a character image.
 
As an alternative image processing technique, there 
is a method which utilizes the characteristic that a 
character image has a larger differential amount or 
density difference at the boundary, and determines 
an image to be a character image if the differential 
amount is large, and not to be a character image in 
other cases. However, because the differential amount 
is large at a boundary not only of a character but also 
of a dot in a dot image, there is a higher possibility 
for a dot image to be determined to be a character image.  If a dot image is determined to be a character image 
and its picture signal is converted to binary signals in 
a binary conversion circuit corresponding to a character 
image, the reproducibility
