suitable for use as a shock absorbing material which comprises 
reacting a specified polyol/monool mixture. Water is used

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing an open cell rigid polyurethane foam suitable for use as a heat
insulating material, structural material or shock absorbing material.A rigid polyurethane foam has an excellent moldability and processability, and is in wide use as a heat insulating
material, structural material or shock absorbing material.In general, a rigid polyurethane foam has closed cells in which such a gas as a volatile chlorofluorocarbon, e.g.,
trichlorofluoromethane (R-11), or carbon dioxide is enclosed. The gas has a small heat conductivity so that a closed
cell rigid polyurethane foam has a high heat insulating performance, and hence is in wide use as a heat insulating
material. On the other hand, a rigid polyurethane foam for use as a structural material does not need a high heat
insulating performance. Nevertheless, such a volatile chlorofluorocarbon as trichlorofluoromethane is usually used as
a blowing agent for the production of a rigid polyurethane loam for use as a structural material since it is inexpensive
and easy to handle.The conventional chlorofluorocarbons exemplified by trichlorofluoromethane are chemically stable so that they
diffuse into the stratosphere to destroy the ozone layer. As results, the solar ultraviolet radiation is not absorbed by the
ozone layer, but it reaches the surface of the earth, and is causing a global environmental problem. For this reason,
the use of trichlorofluoromethane has been limited since 1989, and the use of trichlorofluoromethane for the production
of polyurethane foam as well.It is of course possible to use a closed cell rigid foam as a structural rigid foam. However, as set forth above, the
closed cell foam is produced while it contains a gas in the cells, so that it is necessary to employ a jig having a strength
sufficient to withstand a large foaming pressure when the foam is produced. Moreover, the closed cell foam has not a
sufficient dimensional stability, in particular, a thermal dimensional stability.Therefore, there is no need to use a closed cell rigid foam as a structural material where a high heat insulating
performance is not necessary. Nevertheless, a closed cell rigid foam has been in fact used as a structural material on
account of difficulty of producing an open cell rigid polyurethane foam having a relatively high mechanical strength
without the use of chlorofluorocarbons or freons as a blowing agent. When water is used as a blowing agent, a closed
cell rigid polyurethane foam is readily produced since an organic
