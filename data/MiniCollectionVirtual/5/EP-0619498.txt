<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an MR (magnetic resonance) imaging method, in which a multiplicity of sequences, in each case having at least one radio-frequency pulse and at least one magnetic gradient field, act on an examination region, and in which at least one MR image is reconstructed from the MR signals obtained thereby, as well as to an arrangement for carrying out this method. In this case, optimisation can be achieved by subjecting the MR signal or the MR image to analysis and, as a function of the analysis result, changing the time profile of the radio-frequency pulses and/or of the magnetic gradient field for the following sequences.

<CLAIMS>
An MR method in which a plurality of sequences, each comprising at least
one RF pulse and at least one magnetic gradient field, act on an examination zone and a

series of MR images is reconstructed from the MR signals thus acquired, 
characterized in
that
 MR images of the series are subjected to an automatic analysis and that, in the sense of
a control loop, the variation in time of the RF pulses and/or the magnetic gradient fields for

the sequences of each time a subsequent MR image is varied in dependence on the analysis
result.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 for the positioning of
an object in a human or animal body at least one MR survey image is formed before the

introduction of the object, that after the introduction of the object into the body MR images
of a target region around and in front of the object are continuously formed and combined

with the MR survey image, that for the determination of the position of the front end of the
object the MR images are automatically analyzed, that on the basis thereof the position of

the target region for the respective next MR image is determined, and that the variation in
time of the magnetic gradient fields or the RF pulses is controlled accordingly.
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the object is a catheter
filled with contrast medium and introduced into the body.
A method as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the direction of the
catheter tip is automatically determined from the MR images and that the gradient coils for

generating the magnetic gradient fields active during the introduction of the catheter are
controlled in dependence on this direction so that one magnetic gradient field extends in the

direction of the catheter tip whereas the other fields extend perpendicularly thereto.
A method as claimed in one of the Claims 3 to 4, 
characterized in that
 for the
generating of the MR survey image the body is moved to at least two defined positions, that

the MR survey image is composed from the MR sub-images thus acquired, and that during 
the introduction of the catheter the body is moved to the same positions so that the various

body structures occupy the same position during acquisition of the MR sub-image as well
as during acquisition of the MR image of the target region.
A method as claimed in one of the Claims 3 to 5, in which the catheter is
introduced into an artery, 
characterized in that
 during the introduction of the catheter the
nuclear magnetization in the region behind the catheter tip is saturated.
An apparatus for carrying out the method claimed in one of the preceding
Claims, comprising


a) a gradient coil system (3, 5, 7) for generating magnetic gradient fields in an
examination zone which is traversed by a steady, uniform magnetic field,
b) an RF coil system (11, 12) for generating an RF magnetic field and for
receiving MR signals from the examination zone,
c) means for reconstructing a series of MR images from a number of MR
signals,
d) means for analyzing the MR images of the series,
e) means (17) for influencing the variation in time of the currents in the
gradient coil system (3, 5, 7) and/or in the RF coil system for the sequences of each time a

subsequent MR image in dependence on the analysis result, and
f) means for displaying at least one MR image, of the series.
An MR apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 it comprises

a) means for generating an MR survey image of a body in the examination
zone,
b) means for generating MR images of a target region (103) which is small in
comparison with the MR survey image,
c) analysis means which include an image processing unit for detecting the
position and possibly the direction of the front end of an object in the MR images of the

target region, and for defining the target region for the next MR image in dependence on
the detected position and possibly the direction of the catheter, 
d) means for controlling the gradient coil system and the RF coil system so that
in the next MR image essentially only the nuclear magnetization from the target region

contributes to imaging,
e) means (14) for continuously mapping the MR images of the relevant target
region in the MR survey image and means for displaying the MR image resulting

therefrom.
