<ABSTRACT>
A method for regulating plant growth which comprises applying to a fruit bearing plant an amount of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid or a lower (C1-10) alkyl ester or salt thereof that is nonphytotoxic and effective to provide increased fruit size or quality or faster maturation without causing significant thinning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for regulating plant
growth and enhancing fruit production by application of
3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid or an ester or a
salt thereof to a fruit bearing plant.3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid, also known as
triclopyr, is a well known herbicide for woody plants.
Methods of preparing triclopyr and lower alkyl esters
thereof are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
3,862,952, 4,127,582, and 4,701,531.Use of triclopyr as a thinning agent for mandarin
orange is disclosed in Japanese patent application Kokai No.
80/100307.The invention provides a method for regulating plant
growth which comprises applying to a fruit bearing plant an
amount of 3,5,6-trichloro-dyloxyacetic acid or a lower
(C1-10) alkyl ester or salt thereof that is nonphytotoxic
and effective to provide increased fruit size or quality or
faster maturation without causing significant thinning.A preferred embodiment of the invention is application
of triclopyr to citrus, pome, or stone fruit trees in an
amount that is both nonphytotoxic and effective to enhance
fruit size.A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is
use of triclopyr in controlling development of citrus fruit.As used herein, the term "nonphytotoxic" means not
significantly toxic to the plant.The preferred method of application is as a medium to
high volume overall spray to the fruit bearing plant. The
application rate is in the range from about 10g/ha to about
50 g/ha. In a preferred embodiment, a solution containing 5-15
ppm of triclopyr in water is applied to fruit trees at a
rate of about 1000 to about 2500 L/ha. The preferred active ingredient is triclopyr acid,
however lower alkyl esters (for example C1-10, generally C1-4
esters) and salts of triclopyr may also be used.The preferred formulation is a water dispersible tablet
formed by compressing a mixture comprising 10 percent by
weight of triclopyr acid and 90 percent by weight of tablet
binder.Timing of application is critical to avoiding thinning.
As used herein, the term "significant thinning" means
thinning that results in a yield loss greater than 25
percent (where yield refers to the number of fruit).
Significant thinning can result if an application is made
before the fruit has reached an appropriate growth stage.
In general, the higher the rate and the sooner the
application, the greater the danger of experiencing
significant thinning. In citrus, the appropriate time for
application is at the early stage of fruit growth (20-30 mm
fruit diameter).
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid or a
C
1-10
 alkyl ester or salt thereof as a plant growth
regulating agent for providing increased fruit size or

quality or faster maturation of fruit, without causing
significant thinning, by


applying the said 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic
acid or C
1-10
 alkyl ester or salt thereof to a fruit bearing
plant
at an application rate that is nonphytotoxic and
effective to provide increased fruit size or quality or

faster maturation, and
at a time when the plant is bearing sufficiently
mature fruit so that significant thinning does not occur.
A use as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the fruit bearing
plant is a citrus tree bearing fruit having a diameter of

from 20 to 30 mm.
A use as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the fruit bearing plant is a grapefruit or lemon

tree, bearing fruit with a diameter of from 22 to 28 mm.
A use as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the
fruit bearing plant is a mandarin tree, bearing fruit with

a diameter of from 22 to 26 mm.
A use as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the application rate is from 10 g/ha to 50 g/ha.
A use as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the application rate
is from 20 to 40 g/ha.
A use as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the application rate
is about 37.5 g/ha.
A use as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
wherein a solution containing from 5 ppm to 15 ppm of

3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyacetic acid in water is
applied to fruit trees at a rate of from 1000 to 2500

L/ha.
