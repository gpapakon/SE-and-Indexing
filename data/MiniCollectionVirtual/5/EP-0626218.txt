<ABSTRACT>
A sizing stand (10) for rolling hot-rolled bars (17) comprises at 
least one pair of rolling rolls (13) carried by chocks (12) 

mounted on a support frame (11). Said stand also comprises power 
means (14) able to compression-preload the rolling system with a 

load greater than the maximum working load.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved sizing stand, which enables
hot-rolled bars of a given size to be obtained with very narrow
dimensional tolerances.Using a standard rolling mill, it is currently possible to obtain
hot-rolled bars with precise dimensional tolerances only in terms
of their height, on which the finishing stand operates, whereas
other dimensions such as width and shoulder dimensions, for
example for a round product, are difficult to control, with the
result that a highly precise average diameter and roundness cannot
be obtained.This is a serious drawback, because the market currently requires
very narrow tolerances for products to be subjected to mechanical
machining, such as peeling, grinding etc.GB-A-1 103 482 relates to a sizing stand for rolling hot rolled bar according to the
preamble of claim 1.US-A-4 481 801 shows a prestressed rolling mill incorporating
a system of hydraulically operated load-transfer blocks.DE-A-2 059 692 refers to
a stand with a device for regulating hydrostatically a roll.The object of the invention is to obviate this drawback by
providing a sizing stand able to satisfy current market
requirements, ie by producing hot-rolled bars of a given size with
very narrow dimensional tolerances.This object is attained by a sizing stand presenting the
characteristics given in the claim 1 and dependent claims.The structual and operational characteristics of the invention 
and its advantages compared with the known art will be more
apparent from an examination of the following description given
with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, which show
one embodiment of a sizing stand incorporating the principles of
the invention. On the drawings:
Figure 1 is a longitudinal vertical schematic section showing a
sizing stand according to the invention in a hydraulically
preloaded but non-operating state;Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing the same
preloaded sizing stand in the operating state rolling a bar;Figure 3 is a vertical schematic cross-section showing the
hydraulically preloaded sizing stand of the invention with the
rolling rolls open (rolling with gap);Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 3 showing the same sizing
stand in the operating state rolling a bar, with the rolling rolls
closed (without gap);Figure 5 is a scheme showing a rolling mill for rolling with
precise height tolerances, arid comprising the sizing stand of the
invention;Figure 6 is a scheme showing a rolling mill for rolling with
imprecise tolerances, and comprising two

<CLAIMS>
A sizing stand for rolling hot-rolled bars (17)
comprising at least one pair of rolling rolls (13)

carried by chocks (12) mounted on a support frame (11),
which has a closed-ring configuration, power means (14)

able to compression-preload the rolling system with a
load that is greater than the maximum working load,

wherein said power means (14) act on said chocks, and
counteracting means (15) are provided between said

chocks (12), characterised in that said power means
consist of hydraulic pistons (14) connected to two

independent valve means (21) to provide a quick opening
device, said hydraulic pistons (14) being independently

adjustable.
A stand as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said counteracting means (15) are wedge-shaped elements.
A stand as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
said power means (14) act on said chocks (12) with the

surfaces of the rolling rolls (13) directly in contact
to each other against which preloading forces are

discharged.
