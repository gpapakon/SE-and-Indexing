<ABSTRACT>
Data rates of a first video signal and a second 
video signal which are significantly different in the data 

rates are converted to respective predetermined data 
rates, and both the video signals of one frame are divided 

into respective numbers of macro block. A ratio of the 
number of macro block of the first video signal to the 

number of macro block of the second signal is made to 1:n 
(n: natural number), and a ratio of the number of
 pixel 
in one macro block of a color difference signal of the 

first video signal to the number of pixel in one macro 
block of the color difference signal of the second video 

signal is made to 1:m (m: natural number), a ratio of the 
data rate of the color difference signal of the first 

video signal to the data rate of the color difference 
signal of the second video signal is made to 1:n×m and a 

ratio of a moving speed of a magnetic tape in the first 
video signal to a moving speed of the magnetic tape in the 

second video image is made to 1:n.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for recording and reproducing a digital video signal, and
particularly to an apparatus for recording and reproducing
digital video signals of video images of plural different
video systems.In an example of an apparatus for recording and
reproducing a digital video signal, first, one frame of a
video image is divided into a plurality of image blocks.
Second, the known DCT block (discrete cosine transform
block) composed of 64 pixels (8 pixel × 4 lines × 2
fields) is defined as the unit of image. One image block
comprises one DCT block representing a color difference
signal (R-Y), one DCT block representing another color
difference signal (B-Y) and four DCT blocks representing a
luminance signal Y. Therefore, in the PAL system
(hereinafter referred to as 625/50 system) for example,
one frame of the video image is divided into 45 image
blocks in the horizontal direction and 36 image blocks in
the vertical direction. Consequently, one frame of the
video image is divided into 1620 image blocks. Data of 
each image block divided as mentioned above is converted
into a coded data. A main component of the coded data of
each image block is stored in one synchronizing block
(hereinafter is referred to as SYNC block).Subsequently, one frame of the video image is
divided into 12 sections in the vertical direction. The
SYNC block data having the coded data of the image blocks
in each section are recorded on one video track of a
magnetic tape. In the recording operation, the order of
arrangement of the SYNC block data to be recorded on one
video track is set so that the image blocks corresponding
to those SYNC block data are substantially arranged at
neighboring locations on an original video image. The
video data of one frame divided into 12 sections are
recorded in 12 video tracks.In the NTSC system (hereinafter is referred to
as 525/60 system), one frame of a video image is divided
into 22.5 image block in the horizontal direction and 60
image blocks in the vertical direction, and consequently
one frame is divided into 1350 image blocks. The data of
each image block is converted into a coded data, and is
stored in a corresponding SYNC block. Subsequently, one
frame of the video image is divided into 10 sections in
the vertical direction. A similar operation to the 625/50
system is applied to the data of the image blocks of each
section. The SYNC block data having the coded data of the 
image blocks in each section are recorded in one track of
the magnetic tape.
