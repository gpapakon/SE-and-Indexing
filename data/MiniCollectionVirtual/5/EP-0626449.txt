<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to recombinant deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA), vectors and host organisms which contain the latter, and transgenic plants which contain the recombinant DNA and have increased resistance to harmful organisms and plant diseases, where the recombinant deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) are characterised in that they consist of a combination of the following components or components with a DNA having the same effect in each case, or contain the latter:   (a) a double-stranded cDNA fragment which is derived from the RNA of Scharka virus (plum poxvirus (PPV)) ("Fragment A") and (b) a double-stranded cDNA fragment which is derived from the S RNA of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) ("Fragment B"), it also being possible for this combination to have, besides further DNA fragments which are optionally present, a promoter which acts in plant cells.
