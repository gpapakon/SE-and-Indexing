<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a casting composition containing a ceramic powder, an organic solvent, binders, plasticisers and a dispersant, which is suitable for producing green ceramic sheets by the tape casting process. The dispersant present in the casting composition of the invention is a polyvinyl alcohol - fatty acid ester having a degree of conversion (degree of esterification) in the range from 50 to 100 %. The invention also relates to the use of such a casting composition for producing green ceramic sheets and a process for producing ceramic substrates using the green sheet thus produced.
