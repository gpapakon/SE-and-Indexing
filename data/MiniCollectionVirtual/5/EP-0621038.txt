<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition 
containing a silicate polymer as an active ingredient which 

regulates the function of a living body is provided. The 
silicate polymer of the composition may be manufactured in a 

process wherein silicic acid or silicate is dissolved in an 
aqueous solvent, adjusted to pH 4 to 10, and dried. The 

silicate polymer thus produced is used in the manufacture of 
medicines effective in regulating the function of living 

bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to silicate polymers which
regulate the physiological function of a living body, a method
for manufacturing thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition
containing said polymer as an active ingredient.A living body maintains its life as an independent
organism by controlling physical and chemical conditions of the
body within a certain physiological state, and responding to
alterations of the internal and external environment.Such a mechanism maintaining the homeostasis of a living
body is effected by the living cells of the body, particularly
through their cell membranes. The cell membrane, as is well
known, is made up of a phospholipid bilayer, and recognizes
various molecules with its surface protein, which acts as a
receptor, and selectively transmits chemicals and ions to
achieve intra- and extra-cellular equilibria of substances and
chemical conditions. These mechanisms maintain the
physiological balance of the cell and cause it to act normally.If said balance is disturbed for any reason, however,
various troubles may arise; for instance, a change in the
amount of fatty acid components of phospholipids, i.e. a
decrease of unsaturated fatty acids or an increase in the
amount of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, may make the
cell membrane solid and lower the fluidity of the membrane.The alteration of the membrane fluidity may result in the
hypofunction of the membrane receptors as well as of channels
for sodium, potassium, calcium and other ions, which eventually
brings about functional disturbance of the cell. Chem. Pharm. Bull, vol. 27, no. 8, (1979), pages 1733-9
discusses the effect of the polymerization degree of silicic
acid on the gastrointestinal absorption of silicate in rats.
Reference is made to the use of low molecular weight
polysilicates as antacid agents in order to avoid calculi.JP-A-57 183720 discloses that a drug formed from low
water-solubility water glass powder increases the appetite of
fish and can treat a fish disease such as white mould.JP-A-58 121217 discloses that a liquid formed from inter
alia water glass is effective for treating burns. The burned
part is coated with a volatile solvent containing water glass
with a brush, and the solution allowed to dry to form a
protecting coating over the burned part.The present inventors have conducted continued studies on
the substances which enhance the naturally acquired healing 
power of a living body and contribute to normalization of
functions of the body, focusing on the homeostatic mechanisms
