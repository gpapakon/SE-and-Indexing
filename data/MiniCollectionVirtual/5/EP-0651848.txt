<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to door closers of the kind, sometimes known 
as door checks, which operate during the final part of the closure movement of 
a door towards the associated door frame for the purpose of ensuring that the 
door closes properly and optionally is held in a closed position. Such closers may 
be employed alone or in combination with a closer device which operates over 
substantially the full range of closing movement, i.e. at least up to point at which 
the door check type closer takes over. Conventional door check type closers are designed for mounting on the 
face of a door and usually incorporate a spring driven arm with a relatively large 
roller which protrudes a significant distance from the door so as to be visually 
obtrusive, and co-operates with a keep member installed on the door frame, the 
keep member affording a part which intercepts the roller as the door is closed 
towards the door frame. DE-A-2207106 discloses such a door-check type closer which includes 
a housing designed for mounting within the thickness of a door at an edge face 
thereof and having a spring-driven arm which protrudes from the housing and is 
adapted to engage a trip face provided on an associated keep member adapted 
for mounting in the door frame, engagement of the arm with the trip face as the 
door is moved to its position of closure relative to the frame displacing the arm 
from a first position, in which it extends obliquely from the housing and is 
retained by the driving spring, through an over-centre position so that the spring 
then drives the arm to a second position in which it extends away from the door 
generally perpendicular to the edge face at which the housing is installed. When 
the door is opened, the keep member acts on the arm to return it to its first 
position. However, it is possible for the arm to be displaced, accidentally or 
otherwise, from said first position whilst the door is open, with consequent risk  
 
of damage and failure of the door to close properly if an attempt is then made 
to close the door whilst the arm is in its second position, and it is an object of the 
present invention to overcome such disadvantage. According to the invention we provide a door closer of the door check 
type comprising a housing for assembly with a door and supporting a pivotally 
mounted lever and driving spring means arranged to drive said lever in an 
operative direction, and a keep member for assembly with a door frame to be 
engaged by said lever and co-operate therewith to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A door closer of the door check type comprising a housing (10) for 
assembly with a door and supporting a pivotally mounted lever (21,22,24) and 

driving spring means (32) arranged to drive said lever (21,22,24) in an operative 
direction, and a keep member (40) for assembly with a door frame to be engaged 

by said lever (21,22,24) and co-operate therewith to pull the door towards the 
door frame, wherein said housing (10) comprises an elongate body (20) which 

houses said driving spring means (32) and a mounting plate (11) at one end of 
said body (20) arranged transverse to the length of said body whereby the housing 

body (20) may be mounted within the thickness of the door with said mounting 
plate (11) secured at an edge face of the door, wherein said lever (21,22,24) 

comprises an arm (21) which is movable between a first or "primed" position in 
which it extends generally in or parallel to the plane of the mounting plate (11) 

and protrudes laterally therefrom, and a second or "actuated" position in which 
it extends away from the mounting plate (11) in a direction generally transverse 

to the plane thereof and within the lateral boundaries of the mounting plate (11), 
and wherein said keep member (40) comprises a keep body (44), which defines 

a recess (43) adapted to receive the lever (21,22,24), and a mounting flange (41) 
adjacent to an open mouth of said recess (43) whereby the keep body (44) may 

be recessed into the door frame with the mounting flange (41) secured at an edge 
face of said door frame which is presented towards said edge face of the door at 

which the housing body is mounted, characterised in that the housing (10) 
supports a displaceable latch member (16) which engages with said lever 

(21,22,24) to hold said arm (21) in the first position, and the keep member (40) 
is formed or provided with striker means (45) so arranged and adapted as to 

engage the latch member (16) or a part carried thereby or connected thereto 
when the housing (10) is brought into register with the keep member (40) as the  

 
door is closed, and thereby disengage the latch member (16) from the lever 

(21,22,24). 
A door closer according to Claim 1 wherein the latch member (16) is 
carried by said mounting plate (11) for movement in a direction generally parallel 

to the plane of the mounting plate (11) and is biased by spring means into 
engagement with an abutment face (19) formed on the lever (21,22,24). 
A door closer according to Claim 2 wherein the striker means 
comprises a pin (45) which is mounted on the keep member (40) in a manner 

which permits of adjustment in a direction towards and away from the plane of 
the mounting flange (41). 
A door closer according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the lever (21,22,24) is movable through a dead centre position between said 

primed and actuated positions so that said driving spring means (32) also holds 
the lever in said primed position until the lever (21,22,24) is initially displaced by 

external forces past the dead centre position, the latch member (16) serving as a 
safety catch to prevent such initial displacement of the lever inadvertently. 
A door closer according to Claim 4 wherein the keep member (40) is 
formed or provided with trip means (46) adapted and arranged in use to engage 

said lever (21,22,24) as the housing (10) is brought into register with the keep 
member (40) and displace said lever (21,22,24) from its primed position and past 

its dead centre position, allowing the lever (21,22,24) then to be driven to its 
actuated position and engage a reaction face (48) afforded by the keep member 

(40), the arm (21) of the lever (21,22,24) bearing against said reaction face (48) 
to draw the door towards the door frame.  

 
A door closer according to Claim 5 wherein the trip means (46) 
comprises a cam face (47) for engagement with said lever (21,22,24) and formed 

on a trip member (46) which is adjustably secured to the keep body (44) for 
movement in a direction towards and away from the plane of the mouth of the 

recess (43). 
A door and frame assembly fitted with a door closer according to any 
one of the preceding claims.
