<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more
particularly to a high frequency and high speed field effect
transistor with an improved Schottky gate structure.EP-A2-522 952 shows such a semiconductor device comprising a
Schottky gate structure. Such a HEMT can use different materials
for the electron barrier layers. However, the height of
the electron barrier layer of the Fermi level of the Schottky
gate electrode as known from this document should be improved,
in order to improve the characteristics of the HEMT.Another semiconductor device is known from US-A-5 206 528. This
document discloses a superlattice layer for a MISFET having a
barrier height of the Schottky junction between gate electrode
and the superlattice layer of about 1 eV.Therefore, it is desired to improve the characteristics of the
known semiconductor device.Improvements and developments of high frequency and high speed
field effect transistors made of compound semiconductors such
as InP, InGaAs or other compound semiconductors including In
are very important for revolutions in semiconductor field.
Compound semiconductors such as InP, InGaAs and other compound
semiconductors including In are suitable for high frequency
and high speed field effect transistors as having a property 
of a high electron mobility. Such high electron mobility field
effect transistor showing high frequency and high speed
performances have a Schottky gate contact. Namely, a gate
electrode made of a metal has to be provided directly on a
semiconductor layer so that the gate electrode is electrically
separated from the semiconductor layers through the Schottky
barrier. As well known, a semiconductor-metal contact or
Schottky contact provides a conduction band discontinuity
which serves as a potential barrier or Schottky barrier which
prevents electrons acting as carriers to flow across the
Schottky contact from the metal toward the semiconductor. A
sufficient height of the Schottky barrier is necessary to
suppress a gate leakage current or to suppress electrons to
flow across the Schottky contact from the metal toward the
semiconductor.Using InP or InGaAs for high frequency and high speed
transistors is disclosed in U.K. Mishra 1989 IEEE Transaction
on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 37, No. 9 p. 1279.
The structure of the deice is as follows. A substrate is a
semi-insulating InP substrate. A buffer layer made of InAlAs
is formed on the semi-insulating InP substrate. A non-doped
InGaAs layer is formed on the InAlAs buffer layer. An n-type
InAlAs
