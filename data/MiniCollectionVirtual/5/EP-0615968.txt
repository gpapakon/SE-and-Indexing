<ABSTRACT>
Benzene is alkylated with a C₆ to C₂₀ linear monoolefin at 98% conversion 
of olefin with 85% or better selectivity to monoalkylbenzene formation and with at 

least 90% linearity with respect to monoalkylbenzene formation by contacting the 
benzene and the linear monoolefin at alkylation conditions with a catalyst 

comprising a fluorided silica-alumina having a silica:alumina wt. ratio of 1:1 to 9:1 
and a fluoride content of 1 to 6 wt.%. In a preferred embodiment, the resulting 

linear monoalkylbenzene is sulfonated and neutralized to form a superior 
biodegradable detergent.

<DESCRIPTION>
Over fifty years ago it was recognized that alkylbenzene sulfonates (ABS)
were quite effective detergents superior to natural soaps in many respects.
Because of their lower price, their price stability, and their effectiveness in a wide
range of detergent formulations, ABS rapidly displaced soaps in household
laundry and dishwashing applications and became the standard surfactants for
the detergent industry.The alkylbenzene sulfonates as initially prepared had substantial branching
in the alkyl chain. This situation was maintained until the early 1960's when it
became apparent that the branched alkyl-based detergents were contributing to
the pollution of lakes and streams. Examination of the problem showed that the
branched structure of the alkyl chains was not susceptible to rapid
biodegradation and the surfactant properties of the detergent thus persisted for
long periods of time. This was not the case earlier when natural soaps were
used.After recognizing the biodegradability of ABS based on alkylation by linear
olefins, industry turned its attention to the production of these unbranched olefins
and their subsequent use in the production of linear alkyl benzenes. Processes
were developed for efficient alkylation of benzene by available feedstocks
containing linear olefins, and the production of linear alkyl benzenes (LAB)
became another reliable process. It gradually evolved that hydrogen fluoride (HF)
catalyzed alkylation was particularly effective in LAB production, and an HF-based
alkylation process became the industry standard.With increasing environmental concern came increasing disenchantment
with HF and a concomitant need to find a substitute equal or superior to it in all
respects. Criteria in addition to the price used in the search were: the extent of
conversion effected by the catalyst, the selectivity of monoalkylbenzene
formation, and the linearity of alkylbenzenes produced.Alkylation typically is performed using an excess of benzene relative to
olefins. The ideal catalyst would show 100% conversion of olefins using an equal
molar proportion of benzene and olefins, but since this is not attained one strives 
for maximum olefin conversion using a benzene to olefin molar ratio up to about
30. The better the catalyst, the lower will be the benzene:olefin ratio at a high
conversion of, say, 98%. The degree of conversion at a constant value of
benzene-olefin ratio is a measure of catalytic activity (subject to the caveat that the
ratio must not be so high that the degree of conversion is

<CLAIMS>
A method for alkylating benzene with one or more linear monoolefins
having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms with at least 98% conversion of olefins, at

least 85% selectivity of olefin conversion to monoalkylbenzenes, and with at
least 90% linearity with respect to monoalkylbenzene formation comprising

reacting benzene with the linear monoolefin at alkylating conditions in the
presence of a catalyst where the alkylating conditions include a molar ratio of

benzene to linear monoolefin of 5:1 to 30:1, a temperature from 80°C to
140°C and a pressure from 1480 to 7000 kPa (200 to 1000 psig), and where

the catalyst is an amorphous fluorided silica-alumina having a silica:alumina
weight ratio of from 65:35 to 85:15 and contains from 1 to 6 weight percent

fluoride.
The method of Claim 2 where the molar ratio of benzene to linear
monoolefin is from 8:1 to 20:1.
The method of Claim 1 or 2 where the temperature does not exceed
135°C.
The method of any one of Claims 1 to 3 where the catalyst contains 1.5
to 3.5 weight percent fluoride.
A process for the production of a biodegradable detergent alkylbenzene
sulfonate which comprises: alkylating benzene with at least one linear

monoolefin containing 6 to 20 carbon atoms at alkylating conditions in an
alkylation zone in the presence of a catalytic composite to selectively form

monoalkylated benzenes, sulfonating the monoalkylated benzenes in a
sulfonation zone with a sulfonating agent at sulfonation conditions to form

sulfonic acids of the monoalkylated benzenes; and reacting said sulfonic acids
with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal base to form the monoalkylbenzene

alkali metal sulfonate, characterized in that the alkylated benzene is obtained
by a method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4.
