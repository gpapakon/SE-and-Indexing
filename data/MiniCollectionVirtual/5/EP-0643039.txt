<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aromatic 
o-hydroxyamide compound having an excellent ultraviolet 
ray absorption and heat resistance, and a polymeric 
composition containing the same and having an excellent 
ultraviolet ray resistance and mechanical strength. It is known that conventional ultraviolet ray-absorbing 
benzophenone and benzotriazole compounds 
usually exhibit an ultraviolet ray-absorbing activity 
inherent to specific wavelengths of ultraviolet rays at a 
relatively low temperature. These conventional 
ultraviolet ray-absorbing compounds; however, exhibit an 
unsatisfactory thermal resistance, and thus are 
disadvantageous in that when the compounds are mixed into 
a polymeric material at a high temperature or the 
resultant mixture is shaped at a high temperature, most 
all of the compounds are thermally decomposed or 
sublimated. As a measure to counter the above-mentioned 
disadvantage, it has been attempted to add an inorganic 
material, for example, fine particulate titanium dioxide, 
carbon black or red oxide to the polymeric material. 
However, this attempt is disadvantageous in that since 
the inorganic materials and the polymeric material are 
insoluble in each other, the addition of the inorganic 
materials usually causes the mixed polymeric material to 
have a reduced mechanical performance and to be colored, 
and thus the mixed polymeric material cannot keep a color 
inherent to the polymeric material per se. Usually, polyesters, including wholly aromatic 
polyesters, aliphatic polyamides, wholly aromatic  
 
polyamides (aramids) and polycarbonates are mixed with an 
ultraviolet ray absorber during polymerization 
procedures, before or after shaping or molding 
procedures, or during post processing procedures thereof, 
at a high temperature to enhance their weathering 
resistance. Since the conventional ultraviolet ray 
absorbers are unsatisfactory in thermal resistance, as 
mentioned above, a new type of organic ultraviolet ray 
absorbers having an enhanced ultraviolet ray-absorbing 
activity, thermal resistance and weathering resistance is 
in demand. Especially, aramids have a high tensile 
strength, modulus and thermal resistance and thus are 
widely employed to produce fibers and films. However, it 
is well-known that aramids exhibit an unsatisfactory 
light resistance. To enhance the light resistance of aramids, it 
has been attempted to mix an ultraviolet ray-absorbing 
benzotriazole compound and an anti-oxidant to a dope 
solution of poly-methaphenylene
