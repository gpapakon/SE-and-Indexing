<ABSTRACT>
A wash-up system includes a feed pump (38) and a 
return pump (40) for circulating a liquid coating material 

through a doctor reservoir (24) for applying protective or 
decorative liquid coating material to freshly printed sheets 

in a rotary offset printing press (14). A portable console 
control unit (10) includes flow control valves (42, 44, 46) 

for operating the system in a PURGE/replenishment mode, a 
COAT mode, a WASH mode and a DRAIN mode. The components for 

pumping and valving the coating liquid and cleaning liquid 
are enclosed within the portable console unit, which may be 

remotely located with respect to the press (14). Cleaning 
liquid and waste materials are stored in internal reservoirs 

(34, 36) within the portable console unit. The system may 
be cleaned without removing the coater or coater parts from 

the press, and without exposing press personnel to 
potentially toxic waste materials. The coater assembly may 

be operated in combination with a plate cylinder (16), a 
blanket cylinder (18) or a delivery/transfer cylinder (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sheet-fed, offset rotary 
printing presses, and in particular to a system for 
circulating a liquid material such as protective/decorative 
coating or liquid ink through a coater unit, and including 
apparatus for automatically purging, washing and draining 
the coater and circulation system. In some offset printing applications, it is 
desirable that the press be capable of applying a protective 
and/or decorative coating over all or a portion of the 
surface of the printed sheets. Such coatings typically are 
formed of a UV-curable or water-soluble resin applied as a 
liquid solution or emulsion by an applicator roller over the 
freshly printed sheets to protect the ink and improve the 
appearance of the sheets. Use of such coatings is 
particularly desirable when decorative or protective 
finishes are required, for example in the production of 
posters, record jackets, brochures, magazines, folding 
cartons, labels and the like., Adhesive coatings are 
sometimes applied to folding cartons, record jackets and the 
like. In cases where a coating is to be applied, the 
coating operation is carried out after the final ink 
printing has been performed, usually by an in-line coater or 
by a separate coating unit located downstream of the last 
printing station so that the coating is applied to the 
sheets after final printing, but before the sheets have 
reached the sheet delivery stacker.  When the coater is to remain idle for an extended 
period between jobs, or at the end of the work day, the 
coating should be drained from the coating apparatus, and 
all coater components and flow lines should be thoroughly 
cleaned, using a solvent or detergent solution and rags. 
Typically, the supply and return lines must be flushed, the 
coater must be flushed and hand cleaned, and the coating 
roller or rollers and reservoir pan must be cleaned 
manually. It will be appreciated that a substantial amount 
of press down time is involved during the manual cleaning of 
the coater components. The manual cleaning task requires 
the coater to be removed from the press to provide clean-up 
access to internal components. Moreover, the internal 
surfaces of the doctor blade cavity are difficult to reach 
with a cleaning rag, with the result that the reservoir 
cavity may become contaminated with a sticky coating residue 
which gradually builds up and may contaminate the coating 
liquid during subsequent press runs. The time spent in 
cleaning the coater is non-productive time and therefore 
there
