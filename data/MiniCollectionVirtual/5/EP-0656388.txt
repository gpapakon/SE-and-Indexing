<ABSTRACT>
Composite including a rubber/thermoplastic blend adhering by itself to a thermoplastic material; the blend is in the form of a thermoplastic matrix containing functionalised nodules of rubber which is vulcanised during the mixing with the thermoplastic. Composite articles obtained by overmoulding of the rubber/vulcanised thermoplastic blend onto the thermoplastic.

<CLAIMS>
Composite comprising a thermoplastic rubber
alloy (TPV) adhering by itself to a thermoplastic, the

TPV comprising (i) at least one elastomer which is
functionalized by carboxylic acid radicals, anhydrides,

or salts or esters of the said carboxylic acids, by
epoxy or amino groups, or by halogens, and is

vulcanized and (ii) at least one block copolymer with
polyether or amorphous polyester blocks.
Composite according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the block copolymer of the TPV comprises

polyether or amorphous polyester blocks which
constitute the soft part thereof and polyamide,

polyester or polyurethane blocks which constitute the
hard part thereof.
Process for fabricating the composite according
to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the TPV is

manufactured by blending:

a vulcanizable elastomer functionalized by
carboxylic acid radicals, anhydrides, or salts or

esters of the said carboxylic acids, by epoxy or
amino groups, or by halogens, and having been

formulated beforehand with a vulcanizing agent
and, optionally, fillers and plasticizers,
a block copolymer,

at a temperature high enough to cause melting of the

block copolymer and vulcanization, but with a scorch
time long enough to prevent all the functional groups
 
of the elastomer being consumed before having dispersed

the elastomer intimately in the block copolymer melt,
and in that the TPV and the thermoplastic are combined

by coinjection moulding, overmoulding or coextrusion.
Shoe soles comprising the composite of either
of Claims 1 and 2.
Coextruded profiles comprising the composite of
either of Claims 1 and 2.
Coextruded tubes comprising the
rubber/thermoplastic alloy TPV overmoulded around a

tube having an outer layer made of polyamide.
Conveyor belts comprising the composite of
either of Claims 1 and 2.
Transmission belts comprising the composite of
either of Claims 1 and 2.
