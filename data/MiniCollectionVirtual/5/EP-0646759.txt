<ABSTRACT>
A laminated type evaporator (200) for an automotive air conditioning 
refrigerant circuit 

includes a plurality of tube units (201) having a pair of tray-shaped 
plates (202). Each tray shaped plate 

includes a shallow depression defined therein, a flange extending about 
the periphery 

thereof, and wall disposed at an intermediate location therein and 
extending a portion of 

the length of each plate to thereby define a left side and a right side 
to each plate. A first 

plate in the pair includes a plurality of projections formed in its 
shallow depression. The 

second plate in the pair includes a plurality of projections formed in 
its shallow depression. 

The plurality of projections in the first and second plates are engaged 
by, e.g., inserting one 

into the other, so that the plates are secured against lateral and 
radial relative movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to heat exchangers for refrigerant circuits and, more
particularly, to the heat medium conducting elements which constitute a heat exchanging
area of the heat exchangers.Various types of heat exchangers are known in the prior art. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 5,211,222 to Shinmura discloses a laminated type heat exchanger used for an
evaporator of an automotive air conditioning refrigerant circuit, as shown in Figure 1-3.
With reference to Figures 1-3, the laminated type evaporator 200' includes a plurality of
tube units 201 of aluminum alloy functioning as the heat medium conducting elements,
which form a heat exchanging area 200a of evaporator 200' together with corrugated fins
20. Each of tube units 201 comprises a pair of tray-shaped plates 202 having a clad
construction where a brazing metal sheet is formed on a core metal.As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, each of tray-shaped plates 202 includes a shallow
depression 120 defined therein, a flange 13 formed around the periphery thereof, and a
narrow wall 14 formed in the central region thereof. Narrow wall 14 extends downwardly
from an upper end of plate 202 and terminates approximately one-seventh the length of
plate 202 away from the lower end thereof. Narrow wall 14 includes a flat top surface 14a.
A plurality of diagonally disposed semicylindrical projections 15 project from the inner 
bottom surface of shallow depression 120. Semicylindrical projections 15 are aligned with
one another in each of a plurality of, for example, four rows. There are two rows of
semicylindrical projections 15 located in shallow depression 120 on the right side of narrow
wall 14 and two rows located on the left side thereof. Semicylindrical projections 15 include
a ridge 15a and are utilized order to reinforce the mechanical strength of plate 202.Each of tray-shaped plates 202 includes a pair of tapered connecting tongues 203
projecting upwardly from the upper end thereof. One of the tongues 203 is disposed to the
right of narrow wall 14, and the other tongue 203 is disposed to the left thereof. A
depression 203a is formed in the central region of tongue 203, longitudinally extends from
the upper end to the lower end thereof, and is linked to shallow depression 120 of plate 202.
The bottom surface of depression 203a is formed even with the plane of the inner bottom
surface of shallow depression 120. A pair of diagonally disposed semicylindrical projections
204 are formed on the bottom surface of depression 203a. Semicylindrical
