<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition comprising:(A) at least one halogen-free thermoplastic resin selected from among polyphenylene ether 
resin, polycarbonate resin, polystyrene resin, polyolefin resin, polyamide resin and thermoplastic elastomer, and (B) a phosphoric 

ester compound represented by general formula (I), wherein Q₁, Q₂, Q₃ and Q₄ represent each independently C₁-C₆ alkyl; 
R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ represent each independently methyl or hydrogen; n represents an integer of 1 or above; n1 and n2 

represent each independently an integer of 0 to 2; and m1, m2, m3 and m4 represent each independently an integer of 1 to 
3. The invention can provide a resin composition with excellent flame retardancy wherein the flame retardant is free from 

the problems of smoking in the molding step, vaporization and bleeding on the surface of a molded article. Molded articles 
made from this composition are free from the problems of discoloration, swelling, and the deterioration of the electric characteristics 

due to moisture absorption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin composition which is excellent in flame retardance and is
obtained by incorporating a specific phosphoric acid ester compound into a specific thermoplastic resin not
having halogen (hereinafter, a non-halogenated thermoplastic resin). A flame retardant agent contained in
the resin composition does not cause smoking or volatilize during a molding processing and also does not
bleed to the surface of the moldings. Moldings of the resin composition do not discolor, blister and
deteriorate in electrical properties due to water absorption.A synthetic resin is widely used as a material for construction of buildings, electrical machinery and
devices, automobiles and fibers because it is generally light, excellent in water and chemical resistance, has
excellent electrical insulating and mechanical properties, and is easy to mold. However, a synthetic resin
has the drawback that it is more flammable than a metallic or inorganic material. Consequently, various
methods for imparting flame retardance to a synthetic resin have been proposed. Of these, a method of
incorporating a halogen compound, a phosphorus compound or an inorganic hydrate into the
synthetic resin is most widely used. Particularly, an organic phosphoric acid ester compound such as
triphenyl phosphate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate, or tricresyl phosphate is widely used industrially. However,
conventionally used flame retardant agents have drawbacks in causing smoking and volatilizing during the
molding processing or bleeding to the surface of moldings.In order to alleviate the above drawbacks in practice, it has been attempted to use a phosphoric acid
ester compound having high molecular weight as a flame retardant agent. For example, European Patent
Unexamined Publication No. 7,460 discloses a tri(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phosphate compound; European
Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 129,824, 129,825 and 135,726 and British Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 2,043,083 disclose a resorcinol-bisdiphenyl phosphate compound; and U.S.
Patent No. 4,683,255 discloses a tri-biphenyl phosphate compound. However, large amounts of these
phosphoric acid ester compounds must be used in order to impart flame retardance to the resin. Further,
according to our research findings, these phosphoric acid ester compounds do not satisfy recently
established standards because they cause corrosion during molding, they are denatured during molding or
during prolonged use of the moldings, and cause the moldings to discolor, blister and
