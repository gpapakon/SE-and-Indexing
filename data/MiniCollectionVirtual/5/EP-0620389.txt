<ABSTRACT>
A bellows made of a tubular, elastic material with an essentially wavy or folded cross-sectional configuration along at least part (12) of its axial length has a pattern (15) formed by alternate high and low areas in the areas (13, 16) of the surface which come into contact with each other or with adjacent components during the use of the bellows. The pattern (15) is an effective means of preventing the said surface areas from sticking to one another or to the adjacent component areas (13, 16) under the pressures prevailing during the use of the bellows. A preferred area of application for a bellows of this kind is the slide-ring carrier of a mechanical seal.

<CLAIMS>
A bellows (6) of a tubular elastic material having 
a substantially corrugated or folded cross-sectional 

configuration along at least a portion (12) of its 
axial length, characterized by a structure (14,15) 

consisting of alternating raised and recessed portions 
at at least one of the surface portions (13,16) of the 

corrugated or folded portion (12) of said bellows (6) 
in use of said bellows (6) coming into contact with 

each other or with adjacent components (2) 
The bellows as set forth in claim 1, characterized 
in that said surface structure comprises a pattern of 

knob-like elevations (15). 
The bellows as set forth in claim 1 or 2 for use as 
a seal ring carrier of a mechanical face seal (3), 

characterized in that said surface structure is 
provided on at least an inner surface portion (13) of 

said corrugated or folded portion (12) adjacent to said 
seal ring (15). 
The bellows as set forth in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said surface structure is 

additionally coated with an anti-adhesive material.
