<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayered wiring 
substrate for mounting a semiconductor element, particularly to a 
multilayered wiring substrate having the high density of mounting a 
semiconductor element and the high speed operation, and to a method 
for preparation thereof. With the recent rapid development of the compaction, the 
light-weight and the high performance of a work station and a personal 
computer, it is required that semiconductor elements equipped in these 
electronic instruments have the high speed and the high mounting 
density. Consequently, a heat quantity per a unit area dissipated by the 
semiconductor element is rapidly increased, and a mean for efficiently 
dissipating the heat is required. With the high speed operation of the 
semiconductor element, the delay of signal transmission in a wiring of 
a package cannot be neglected, and the package is required to have a 
high heat dissipation property as well as a low dielectric constant. For example, Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 
251158/1986 discloses that a heat-dissipating substrate comprises 
diamond which contains an impurity for improving an electrical 
conductivity and is prepared by a vapor phase deposition. Japanese 
Patent Kokai Publication No. 44757/1990 discloses a three-dimensional 
integrated circuit which comprises a laminate of at least three layers 
having at least one semiconductive layer and at least one electrically 
insulating layer of diamond. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No.  
 
23639/1990 discloses a multilayered circuit substrate which 
comprises a diamond base material prepared by a vapor phase 
deposition, wiring multilayers formed on a base material surface, and 
an interlaminar insulating diamond layer positioned between the wiring 
multilayers and prepared by a vapor phase deposition. Japanese Patent 
Kokai Publication No. 293931/1988 discloses a semiconductor device 
having heat-dissipating bump electrodes which are formed by using a 
diamond thin film as a base material. Japanese Patent Kokai 
Publication No. 23639/1990 discloses a multilayer circuit substrate 
which comprises a diamond base material prepared by a vapor phase 
deposition, wiring multilayers formed on a base material surface and an 
interlaminar insulating diamond layer prepared by a vapor phase 
deposition and positioned between the wiring multilayers. Although alumina and multilayered wiring alumina are mainly 
used as a substrate for mounting semiconductor elements, the thermal 
conductivities thereof are low
