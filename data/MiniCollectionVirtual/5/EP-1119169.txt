<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for determining a language of a call handled by an
automatic call distributor is disclosed. The method includes the steps of

detecting the call, sampling an audio portion of the call, fitting a plurality of
templates to the sampled portion of the call, and determining a language of the

call based upon a best relative fit between one of the plurality of audio templates
and the sampled portion of the call.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to telephony, and more particularly, to automatic call distributors.An automatic call distributor (ACD) is a system that facilitates the management of incoming and outgoing calls at telephone call centers. Traditionally, an ACD consisted of a specialized telephone switch for routing customer calls to available agents. The method for routing such calls is typically based on obtaining an equitable distribution of calls for each agent.Today, like all business entities, call centers are experiencing incredible growth due to an increasingly interconnected, global and digital world. Incident to the operation of call centers is the accumulation of vast quantities of valuable information. In response to the availability of such information, owners of these call centers are demanding ACD systems with more sophisticated information management and channeling capabilities. Thus, modern ACD systems commonly incorporate various management tools including automated call identification, automated agent selection, automated call distribution, automated voice response, data integration, voice messaging, automated outbound call management, and real time displays that forecast load and analyze historical data.Furthermore, modern ACD systems typically use improved methods for routing calls other than the traditional method based on equitable distribution. One such method is skill based routing. Skill based routing is typically based on the identity of the caller or on the number called and enables a call center to route calls to the agent most qualified to handle the customer request. When coupled, for example, with additional services such as a Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) that identifies a particular service number called by a customer, skill based routing can greatly increase the productivity of a call center.While skill based methods for routing calls are commonly found in modern ACD systems, there is no known analogous development of a language based method of routing calls. However, in an increasingly global business environment, the need to identify the native language of customers is obvious. For example, when a customer answers the phone during an outdialing campaign, she may not necessarily speak the same language as the agent handling the call. Thus, regardless of any advantages that skill based routing might provide, such language barriers lead to confusion between the agent and customer which ultimately decreases productivity for the call center.In March 1997, the

A method of routing an inbound call based on a language of a customer (102) by an automatic call distributor (100), wherein the customer (102) and the automatic call distributor (100) are coupled by an external public switching telephone network PSTN (104), said method comprising the steps of:

a) detecting an incoming call from the customer (102);
b) extracting additional information from the PSTN (104);
c) making an initial determination of the language of the calling customer (102) using the extracted additional information to provide a best guessed determined language and switching the call to an appropriate response service (112, 114);
d) greeting the calling customer (102) with a salutation in the best guessed determined language;
e) analyzing a response of the calling customer (102) to confirm that the best guessed
 language was indeed the proper language to use and, if the guessed language was incorrect, reconnecting the inbound call to the appropriate response service (112, 114),

wherein the analyzing step further comprises:

sampling an audio portion of the response of the calling customer to the salutation;
fitting a plurality of audio templates to the sampled audio portion;
and determining the language of the calling customer based upon a best relative fit between one of the plurality of audio templates and the sampled audio portion.
The method of routing an inbound call as in claim 1, wherein the additional information provided by the PSTN (104) includes:

a Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) to identify which of a plurality of service numbers a customer actually called, or
an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) service to identify the number of the calling customer (102); or
a surname of the calling customer (102); or
an ANI number to identify a geographic location of the calling customer (102) to determine whether there is a specific language associated with that location; or
a marketing information associated with the ANI number, including the language of the calling customer (102).
An apparatus for routing an inbound call based on a language of the customer (102) by an automatic call distributor (100), wherein the customer (102) and the automatic call distributor (100) are coupled by an
 external public switching telephone network PSTN (104), said apparatus comprising:

means for detecting an incoming call from the customer (102);
means for extracting an additional information from the PSTN (104) ;
means for making an initial determination of the language of the calling customer (102) using the extracted additional information to provide a best guessed determined language and switching the call to an appropriate response service (112, 114);
means for greeting the calling customer (102) with a salutation in the best guessed determined language;
means for analyzing the response of the calling customer (102) to confirm that the best guessed language was indeed the proper language to use and, if the guessed language was incorrect, reconnecting the inbound call to the appropriate response service (112, 114),

wherein the analyzing means comprise

means for sampling an audio portion of the response of the calling customer (102) to the salutation;

means for fitting a plurality of audio templates to the sampled audio portion,

wherein the language of the calling customer is determined based upon a best relative fit between one of the plurality of audio templates and the sampled audio portion.
The apparatus for routing an inbound call as in claim 3, wherein the additional information provided by the PSTN includes:
a Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) to identify which of a plurality of service numbers a customer actually called, or
an Automatic Number Identification (ANI) service to identify the number of the calling customer (102), or a surname of the calling customer (102); or
an ANI number to identify a geographic location of the calling customer (102) to determine whether there is a specific language associated with that location; or
a marketing information associated with the ANI number, including the language of the calling customer (102).
