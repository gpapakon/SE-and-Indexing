<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of N-(pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amines for the
preparation of a medicament for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disordersEP-A-534 343 discloses pyridinylamino 1H-indoles, in which the pyridino group is
linked via the amino bridge to the phenyl moiety of the indole ring structure, for use
in, inter alia, the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders.EP-A-509 402 discloses 3-(pyridinylamino)indoles for use in, inter alia, the treatment
of obsessive compulsive disorders.EP-A-287 982 discloses N-(pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amines for use as memory
enhancing, analgesic and anti-depressant agents.The present invention particularily relates to the use of a compound of formula I,

where
m is 0,1 or 2R is halogen, loweralkyl, loweralkoxy, arylloweralkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, amino,
loweralkylamino or diloweralkylamino;R1 is H or loweralkyl;R2 is H or loweralkyl; andR3 is H, halogen or loweralkyl,
or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, for the preparation of a
medicament for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders. Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or
name shall encompass all stereo, optical and geometrical isomers thereof where
such isomers exist, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts
thereof and solvates thereof such as for instance hydrates.The following general rules of terminology shall apply throughout the specification
and the appended claims.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the term lower or (C1-C6)alkyl denotes a
straight or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of said
loweralkyl include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl,
t-butyl and straight- and branched-chain pentyl and hexyl.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the term lower or (C1-C6)alkoxy denotes a
straight or branched alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of
said loweralkoxy include methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, iso-propoxy, n-butoxy,
iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, t-butoxy and straight- and branched-chain pentoxy and
hexoxy.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the term halogen shall mean fluorine, chlorine,
bromine or iodine.The compounds of Formula I used in the method of this invention can be prepared
by utilizing the synthetic scheme described below where the parameters R, R1, R2,
R3 and m have the respective meanings as defined above unless otherwise
indicated.An N-aminoindole of Formula II (where R4 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, loweralkoxy,
