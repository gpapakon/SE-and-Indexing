<ABSTRACT>
The present invention deals with a thermoplastic composition comprising (a) a 
compatibilized polyphenylene ether-polyamide base resin, and (b) 1-40 parts by 

weight per 100 parts by weight of polyphenylene ether present in (a) of one or more 
phosphorus compounds with the formula O=P-[Z]
₃, in which each Z can be the same 
or a different group and wherein each Z sterically hinders the reactivity of the O=P≡ 

moiety of the phosphorus compound. 
The composition may further comprise (c) 1-30 parts by weight 
per 100 parts by weight of polyamide present in (a) of one more compounds 

containing a bound triazine radical from the group of cyanuric acid and its 
derivatives. 
The use of special phosphorus compounds as described above makes it 
possible to manufacture the compositions in a simple way while obtaining stable 

compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic compositions comprising (a) a 
compatibilized polyphenylene ether-polyamide resin, and (b) 1-40 parts by weight 
per 100 parts by weight of polyphenylene ether present in (a) of one or more 
phosphorus compounds. The thermoplastic compositions may further comprise (c) 1-30 parts by 
weight per 100 parts by weight of polyamide present in (a) of one more compounds 
containing a bound triazine radical from the group of cyanuric acid and its 
derivatives. The invention also relates to articles formed out of the compositions of the 
invention. US-A-4,866,114 discloses thermoplastic polyphenylene ethers/polyamide 
molding materials which contain as essential components a component A and a 
component B. Component A consists of a modified polyphenylene ether and a 
compound containing bound phosphorus. Component B consists of one or more 
polyamides and one or more compounds containing a bound triazine radical from the 
group consisting of cyanuric acid and its derivatives. The compound containing bound phosphorus can be chosen from a great 
variety of compounds. Among those monomeric, cyclic and polymeric compounds 
have been mentioned in US-A-4,866,114. Triphenyl phosphate is said to be "very 
particularly suitable". The composition of US-A-4,866,114 is prepared by first preparing 
components A and B and then bringing them together.  The compositions of US-A-4,866,114 are very useful compositions combining 
good mechanical properties and good flame retardant properties. It has been found that it is necessary in the manufacture of the composition of 
US-A-4,866,114 to prevent mixing the polyamide with the phosphate prior to having 
blended the phosphate with the polyphenylene ether or the modified polyphenylene 
ether. If the unblended phosphate is directly blended with the polyamide at elevated 
temperatures where the components are in a viscous state, a sharp increase in torque 
may occur. This occurs in particular when the mixing temperatures and the mixing 
time periods are not well controlled. This makes it somewhat complicated to prepare 
the compositions of US-A-4,866,114 in that a special mixing sequence has to be 
observed. It has further been found that the presence of compounds containing a bound 
triazine radical is not absolutely necessary. The invention resides on the finding that phosphorus compounds with the 
formula O=P-[Z]₃ in which each Z can be the same or a different group and wherein 
each Z sterically hinders the reactivity of the O=P≡ moiety of the
