<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of protein
purification. More specifically, this invention
relates to the application of combination
chromatography to the purification of complement
receptor proteins.In particular, this invention relates to the application of
various combinations of ion exchange, optional precipitation,
HIC and size exclusion chromatography to the purification of
complement receptor-like molecules.Historically, protein purification schemes have
been predicated on differences in the molecular
properties of size, charge and solubility between the
protein to be purified and undesired protein
contaminants. Protocols based on these parameters
include size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange
chromatography, differential precipitation and the
like.Size exclusion chromatography, otherwise known as
gel filtration or gel permeation chromatography,
relies on the penetration of macromolecules in a
mobile phase into the pores of stationary phase
particles. Differential penetration is a function of
the hydrodynamic volume of the particles.
Accordingly, under ideal conditions the larger
molecules are excluded from the interior of the 
particles while the smaller molecules are accessible
to this volume and the order of elusion can be
predicted by the size of the protein because a linear
relationship exists between elusion volume and the log
of the molecular weight. Size exclusion
chromatographic supports based on cross-linked
dextrans e.g. SEPHADEX®, spherical agarose beads e.g.
SEPHAROSE® (both commercially available from Pharmacia
AB. Uppsala, Sweden), based on cross-linked
polyacrylamides e.g. BIO-GEL® (commercially available
from BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, California) or
based on ethylene glycol-methacrylate copolymer e.g.
TOYOPEARL HW65S (commercially available from ToyoSoda
Co., Tokyo, Japan) are useful in the practice of this
invention.Precipitation methods are predicated on the fact
that in crude mixtures of proteins the solubilities of
individual proteins are likely to vary widely.
Although the solubility of a protein in an aqueous
medium depends on a variety of factors, for purposes
of this discussion it can be said generally that a
protein will be soluble if its interaction with the
solvent is stronger than its interaction with protein
molecules of the same or similar kind. Without
wishing to be bound by any particular mechanistic
theory describing precipitation phenomena, it is 
nonetheless believed that the interaction between a
protein and water molecules occurs by hydrogen
bond
