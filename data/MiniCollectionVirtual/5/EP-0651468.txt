<ABSTRACT>
A circuit board (12) has electrical connector (10) 
mounted to an edge (18) thereof. The 

circuit board (12) includes an edge (18) and two major 
surfaces (14,16) extending therefrom having circuitry 

(20). Plated through holes (24) are arranged adjacent 
the edge and are interconnected to circuitry on the 

circuit board. Each plated through hole (24) is 
associated with an opening such as a slot (26) or 

partial slot (27) that is formed in the edge (18) of the 
board so that it intersects the hole. The posts (32) of 

the connector (10) extend into the openings (26,27) 
preferably in interference fit therewith whereafter 

soldering completes the electrical connections of the 
posts to the through holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit board
and an electrical connector mountable to an edge thereof
and more particularly to means for interconnecting
ground circuitry on the circuit board with ground posts
on the connector.In certain high density circuit board applications
such as board to board interconnections one of the
mating connectors is attached to the edge of one of the
boards and the other connector is either attached to the
edge or the surface of the other board. Such
connectors, when mounted to the edge of the board,
occupy less board space than their surface mount
counterparts, and therefore are more desirable in these
applications. Examples of these types of connectors are
disclosed in EP-A-0 510 869 and US-A-5,127,839.
In such edge
mounted connectors, the signal contacts generally have
solder tails that extend outwardly in two parallel rows,
one row of tails being in contact with pads on one side
of the circuit board and the tails in the other row
being in contact with pads on the opposite sides of the
circuit board. The ground contacts are positioned so
that their posts extend outwardly in a row between and
parallel with the two rows of signal contact solder
tails. The ground posts extend into holes in the edge
of the circuit board and engage transversely arranged
plated through holes that are interconnected with ground
circuitry on the circuit board. Solder paste in the
plated through holes and on the contact pads is
reflowed, to effect soldered connections between the
posts and solder tails and their respective holes and
pads. As the circuitry on these circuit boards becomes more
dense, the edge mounted connector must become correspondingly
smaller resulting in very delicate contacts. Any variation
in alignment during assembly of the connector to the circuit
board may cause the contacts to become damaged. Therefore,
precise alignment is necessary. This requires that the holes
in the edge of the circuit board be very precisely located
between the two major surfaces. It is known to drill or to
pierce or punch these holes from the edge of the board inwardly
toward and through the wall of the plated through hole. This
tends to cause portions of the insulating circuit board to
enter the plated through hole and to interfere with the
subsequent soldering process, and such debris must be cleaned
out prior to soldering. Additionally, these holes are only
about 0.46mm (0.018 inch) square making the punch tooling
fragile and easily damaged. As a result, these openings are
difficult and
