<ABSTRACT>
A method for signal transmission and reception by a 
bidirectional bus system in which plural devices performing the 

communication of a command and a request are interconnected over 
a bidirectional bus is disclosed. The method includes the steps 

of constituting a frame of a transmission signal on the 
bidirectional bus from an address field for designating addresses 

of communicating devices and a data field for designating the 
command or request to be transmitted, and inserting the 

discriminating information for discrimination between the command 
and the request at a pre-set position in the data field. The 

transmission signals having the discrimination information is 
transmitted over the bidirectional bus to other devices. A 

communication system employing such bidirectional bus system is 
also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for transmission, a
method for reception, a method for communication, and a bi-directional
bus system. The present invention is applied to, for
example, a system for controlling sub-devices, such as a monitor
receiver, a TV tuner or a video deck enclosed in devices such as
a television receiver or a video tape recorder, or transmitting
the operating states of these devices, over a bi-directional bus
interconnecting these devices.It has recently been extensively practiced to interconnect
plural audio equipment or visual equipment, referred to herein
as AV equipment, over a video signal line or an audio signal
line, referred to herein as an AV signal line, in order to form
an AV system.With such AV system, it is practiced to interconnect the
equipment over a system control bus, in addition to the above-mentioned
AV signal bus, referred to herein as a bi-directional
bus, in order to control the equipment among one another and to
transmit data indicating the operation statuses etc., of the
equipment, also referred to herein simply as statuses.
Illustrative examples of these systems include audio, video and
audiovisual systems, domestic digital bus (D2B) as specified in
IEC Publication 1030 issued in May 1991 and a home bus system
(HBS) as disclosed in "Transistor Technology, special issue,
No.30, chapter 7, published by CQ Publications on November 1, 
1991. Using a bi-directional bus, the equipment or devices, such
as a television receiver (TV), a video tape recorder (VTR) or a
video deck player (VDP) control other equipment or sub-devices
enclosed in these other devices, such as a monitor TV receiver,
a TV tuner, a video deck or an amplifier. In addition, the
statuses of the devices or sub-devices are transmitted over the
bidirectional bus. With the D2B, for example, a carrier sense
multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is adopted as
the bidiretional accessing system.Thus the communication from a sub-device enclosed in a
device to a sub-device enclosed in another device, the
communication from a sub-device enclosed in a device to another
device, the communication from a device to a sub-device enclosed
in another device and the communication from a device to another
device, are executed over the bidirectional bus.The format for transmission signals employed in the above-mentioned
bidirectional bus, such as D2B, is now explained. With
the D2B, commands or statuses for controlling the sub-devices
etc., of the destination of transmission, referred to herein as
a
