<ABSTRACT>
The metal lock ring (30) of the invention has an 
oblong exterior periphery which allows the ring to have a 

small "width" and a larger "height". The small "width" 
provides a strong locking mechanism on the poly liner (14) 

and the larger "height" allows the ring to remain secure 
within the groove (18) of the metal shell (12) prior to and 

during assembly of the polyethylene liner (14). The ring 
has a chamfer on its inside leading edges defining its 

width to facilitate assembly of the liner (14). 
In the preferred embodiment, the lock ring 

has a constant thickness such that the inner periphery and 
the outer periphery are oval. 
In an alternative embodiment, the metal lock ring (30) 
has a round inner diameter and a round outer diameter that 

are not concentric, thereby creating a thickening of the 

ring at one end (50). The shape of the alternative lock 
ring provides for substantial contact between the lock ring 

(30) and the poly liner (14) about the liner (14). The 
thickened area (50) of the ring (30) retains the ring (30) 

within the metal cup (12) prior to and during assembly of 
the poly liner (14). The thickened portion of the ring 

(30) may have scallops or notches (52) formed therein to 
increase the flexibility of the ring (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acetabular cup assemblies having a cup
and a liner retained in the cup by a locking ring for use in total hip
arthroplasty and has specific relevance to a locking ring for retaining
a polymer liner within a metal cup.Prosthetic acetabular cups are well known in the industry for
replacing a portion of a patient's hip joint during total hip
arthroplasty. One form of acetabular component includes a metal cup
and a polyethylene liner secured therein by a variety of mechanical
fasteners. The metal cup is affixed to the prepared acetabulum either
by mechanical fasteners or by cement. Some metal cups include a porous
surface layer to provide a structure for bone growth to enhance
fixation of the cup. The polyethylene liner forms the articular
surface for mating with the head of the femur or implant and are
connected to the metal cup by a variety of fastening devices.One such device for retaining the liner within the cup
such as described in US-A-5049158 is
a round lock ring which is carried within a groove formed in the metal
cup and communicates in an interference fit with a groove formed on the
exterior of the polyethylene liner. This type of cup assembly is
generally packaged with the lock ring and metal cup connected and the
liner packaged separately. During the surgery, the liner is placed
into the metal cup by pressing the liner into the cup and thereby
spreading the lock ring slightly. The lock ring snaps into the groove
formed on the exterior of the liner when properly aligned. The lock
ring has a generally constant diameter or, in other words, is circular.A problem exists with this type of construction since the lock
ring is free floating within the groove of the metal cup prior to
insertion of the liner. As the ring floats to one side, the other side
of the ring is no longer supported by the metal shell. This can result
in disassembly of the ring or difficult assembly of the poly liner.The metal lock ring of the invention has oblong exterior
periphery which allows the ring to have a small "width" and a larger
"height." The small "width" provides a strong locking mechanism on the 
poly liner and the larger "height" allows the ring to remain secure
within the groove of the metal shell prior to and during assembly of
the polyethylene liner. The ring has a chamfer on its inside leading
edges defining its width to facilitate assembly of the liner. The
chamfer is produced on the ring so that there is a maximum chamfer at
the "width" and little or no chamfer at the "height." This

<CLAIMS>
A prosthetic acetabular cup assembly comprising a
prosthetic acetabular cup (12) and an acetabular liner (14)

removably retained within the cup (12) by a locking ring
(30), the cup (12) having a groove (18) formed adjacent the

opening of the cup (12), the locking
ring (30) is accommodated in the groove (18),

characterised in that said locking
ring being oblong such that at least two opposed points of

the ring (30) remain supported by the cup (12) when the
locking ring (30) is shifted relative to the cup (12).
The acetabular cup assembly of claim 1 characterised
in that the ring (30) defines a length and a width in

generally transverse planes and said width is less than
said length.
The acetabular cup assembly of claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the ring (30) is formed having a

generally constant cross section.
The acetabular cup assembly of claim 2 characterised
in that the ring (30) includes an annular internal edge

(33,34), the annular internal edge (33,34) being chamfered
along portions of the ring (30) defining the width.
