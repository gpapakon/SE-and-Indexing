<ABSTRACT>
The Venetian blind has two mutually parallel securing profiles (22) for slats (16). Said slats (16) have an essentially S-shaped cross-section. The securing profiles (22), which run on the inside at a distance from the frame parts (12), have oblique surfaces (28) for the abutting flaps (16) and pairs of slots (24, 26) for receiving the legs (30, 32) of the slats (16). At least one leg (32) of the slat (16) may be of a resilient design and latch in via a clip connection. The Venetian blinds according to the invention permit a saving to be made in terms of materials and allow a greater degree of clearance for the arrangement of the ventilation slots.

Louvre shutter (10) with two parallel holding profiles 
(22) for slats (16),
 
characterised in that
 
the slats (16) have an essentially S-shaped cross-section, 

the holding profiles (22) running on the inside 
at a distance (a) from the frame elements (12) have 

oblique surfaces (28) for the slats (16) resting thereon 
and paired slots (24, 26) to hold the edges (30, 32) of 

the slats (16), with a first slot (24) open on the 
outside for an inward-curving lower edge (32) of a slat 

(16), and a second slot (26) overlapping from the inside 
the slot (24) and open on the outside for an outward-curving 

upper edge (30) of the next lower slat (16). 
Louvre shutter (10) according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the holding profiles (22) run parallel to the 

two frame elements (12) and are preferably screwed, 
riveted or welded thereto. 
Louvre shutter (10) according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the holding profiles (22) run parallel to the 

two frame elements (12) and are formed of one piece with 
the frame parts (12), preferably shaped as rectangular 

profiles. 
Louvre shutter (10) according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the first slot (24) is limited by 

a spring leg (42) with a lug (40) at the end, and the 
lower edge (32) of the slat (16) engaging in the slot 

(24) has a longitudinal notch (38) for the lug (40).  
 
Louvre shutter (10) according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the spring leg (42) of the holding 

profile (22) forming the first slot (24) is removed and 
in the rear lower area of the remaining tab (50) a 

groove (52) is formed to engage with a longitudinal end 
lug (46) on the inside of the sprung edge (32) of the 

slat (16). 
Louvre shutter (10) according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the tab (50) of the holding profile (22) has a 

step (48) for clipping the lug (46) of the sprung edge 
(32) of the slat (16). 
Louvre shutter (10) according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the tab (50) of the holding profile (22) is 

shortened to the step (48). 
Louvre shutter (10) according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the inner short side (20) of the 

vertical frame element (12) with the holding profile 
(22) has a longitudinal outer bead (36) in the area of 

the slots (24, 26). 
Louvre shutter (10) according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the longitudinal bead (36) consists of, or is 

formed from, a soft material applied as a strip. 
Louvre shutter (10) according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the inner short side (20) of the 

vertical frame element (12) has a step (44) in the area 
of the holding profile (22), where the distance (a) of 

the holding profile (22) from the inner narrow side (20) 
remains unchanged.
