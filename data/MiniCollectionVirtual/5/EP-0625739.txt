<ABSTRACT>
The accuracy of an apparatus for the movement of an object is increased by 
means of compensating for geometric errors and load and temperature induced 

deformations. The effects of the errors and deformations are stored in regularly updated 
compensation tables or parameterisations from which the error values as a function of 

position are available. The appropriate error values are selected while the complete 
momentary state of the apparatus can be taken into account. The derived error values 

can be used to correct the measured position in a feedback loop or to modify the 
steering signals for driving means without use of a feedback loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for movement of an object comprising
a driving mechanism for moving the object in at least one direction,a control unit, coupled to the driving mechanism, for controlling the movement of said
object to a target position by repetitively generating steering signals to be applied to the driving
mechanism,error compensating means for compensating effects of errors in the driving mechanism
which errors cause a deviation between an actual position and the target position, the control unit
comprises an effect source from which said effects of said errors in the driving mechanism are
available, in that said control unit and said error compensating means are integrated such that the
control unit is arranged for accessing said effect source during each repetition of generating
steering signals, or at least a substantial fraction of such repetitions, for obtaining error values
indicating the effects of errors and that said effects are taken into account while generating
steering signals. Such an apparatus is, for example, a surface mount machine for the placement of
components on a printed circuit board, a numerically controlled milling-machine, a robot, or
another type of apparatus which has to perform some movement with high accuracy. The
invention also relates to a control unit for controlling such an apparatus. The term driving
mechanism is to be interpreted broadly in the framework of the present invention. It encompasses
not only a motor or other force generating device but also passive and active components to
guide the movement, such as carriages, cross-slides and work-tables. Also the term "target
position" is to be interpreted not only as a final position but also as each one of the very many
positions on a path that has to be followed accurately.Such apparatus is known from EP-A-0 049 153. In that patent application
an apparatus is described comprising a system with more degrees of freedom than physical
dimensions of a work space in which system a position of a body can be reached by different
positions of control axes. However, only one set of error values is available from a correction
table that is addressed by a command position of the body in the work space. The error values 
employed are indicated in that document as the so-called "absolute" corrective values, which
absolute corrective values correspond to respective subregions of space obtained by dividing a
three-dimensional space into a multiplicity of smaller regions, i.e. the sub-regions are derived
from
