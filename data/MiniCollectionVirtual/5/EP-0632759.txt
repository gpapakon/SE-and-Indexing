<ABSTRACT>
A device for pre-processing a synthetic thermoplastic material, such as polyester waste, comprises at least two containers (1, 13) connected in series, in each of which a comminuting and mixing tool (5) rotates at the base of the containers (1, 13) about a vertical axis. At least the downstream container has an evacuation duct (18) which can also be used to introduce an inert gas if required. The containers (1, 13) are connected by a sleeve (12) in which there is a stop valve (20) to facilitate trouble free maintenance of the vacuum in the downstream container (13) until the valve (20) is opened, thus allowing the vacuum in the container (13) to draw in the material in the upstream container (1). In the upstream container (1) (as seen in the flow-direction of the material), the material is pre-comminuted, pre-heated, pre-dried and pre-compacted and that process is enhanced by the turbulence in the material as it is sucked into the downstream container (13). Completely homogenous material is thus transported for further processing by a worm (16) which is connected to the last container (13).

<CLAIMS>
A device for processing thermoplastic synthetic material, for example of polyester, optionally 
in the form of waste, with a container (13) for the material to be treated, to which 

the said material is conveyed through an insertion opening (14) and from which the material 
is removed by at least one worm (16) attached to the lateral wall of the container 

(13), wherein at least one tool (5) rotatable about a vertical shaft and provided with operating 
edges (7) acting in such a way as to crush and/or mix the material is arranged in 

the base area of the container (13) and wherein the entry opening (15) of the worm (16) 
is situated at least approximately at the level of the tool (5), and with at least one line 

(18) connected to the container (13) for producing a vacuum and optionally for gassing 
the interior of the container, 
characterized in that
 the discharge opening (10) of at least 
one further container (1, 23) is connected to the insertion opening (14) by means of a 

pipe connexion (12), in which container (1, 23) at least one tool (5) revolving about a 
vertical shaft (4) is likewise provided in the base area of the container (1, 23), and a shut-off 

member (20) for closing off the pipe connexion (12) in a pressure-tight manner is 
arranged in the pipe connexion (12) in order to maintain the vacuum in the interior of the 

container (13) provided with the line (18). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the discharge opening (10) of the 
further container (1, 23) is situated at least approximately at the level of the tool (5) in 

the said container (1, 23). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the shut-off member (20) 
comprises a slide plate (21). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the shut-off member (20) 
comprises a sluice, in particular a cellular wheel sluice (24). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the container (1) 
arranged upstream in the direction of flow of the material is situated at a higher level 

than the following container (13) (Fig. 3). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the discharge opening 
(10) of the container (1) arranged upstream in the direction of flow of the material has a 

widened portion (28) on the inflow side of the tool (5) (Figs. 4, 5).  
 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the insertion opening 
(14) of the container (13) arranged downstream in the direction of flow of the material 

has a widened portion (29) on the outflow side of the tool (5) (Figs. 4, 5). 
A device according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the widened portion (28, 29) 
is formed in the manner of a pocket, preferably with a cross-section extending in the 

shape of a sickle. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the shut-off member 
(20) is arranged close to the wall (9) of the container (1) arranged upstream in the direction 

of flow of the material, preferably on the base of the widened portion (28) of the 
discharge opening (10) of the said container (1). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the containers (1, 13, 
23) can be heated and/or cooled, optionally in a different manner.
