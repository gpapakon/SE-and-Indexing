<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of manufacturing metal components protected against corrosion by passivation, the method calling for the metal component to be coated with a layer of an intrinsically conducting polymer and for the coated component to be brought into contact with oxygen-containing water until the equilibrium potential is reached, polyaniline being preferably used as the conducting polymer.

Process for producing corrosion-protected
metallic materials, characterized in that


(a) from a dispersion of an intrinsically conductive
and water-absorptive polymer which has a redox

potential relative to the standard hydrogen
electrode of from -300 to +1,800 mV a coat of the

polymer is applied by non-electrochemical means to
a metallic material, the polymer having a water-absorptivity

of at least 0.5% by weight, based on
the dry weight of the applied polymer coating, and
(b) the metallic material coated in step (a) is
brought into contact with a passivating medium

comprising oxygen-containing water for a period of
at least 30 seconds and preferably until the

equilibrium potential is reached,

and, after steps (a) and (b) have been run through,

(c) if desired, a subsequent passivation step is
conducted by bringing the metallic material for a

period of at least 1.5 minutes to a potential
which is from 50 to 500 mV more negative (relative

to the standard hydrogen electrode) than the
equilibrium potential of the metallic material

coated with the conductive polymer, operating with
no current or with less than 2 mA/cm
2

(d) if desired, the coat of the conductive polymer is
removed, and
(e) if desired, the metallic material is provided with
an anticorrosion coating.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that polyaniline is used as conductive polymer.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the conductive polymer has a

water-absorptivity of at least 1% by weight, based on
the dry weight of the applied polymer coating.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that oxygen-containing water is

employed as passivating medium.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the water has a conductivity of at least 20 ÂµS.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that a polymer blend comprising

intrinsically conductive polymer is employed as

Process according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the polymer blend contains from 0.1 to 45% by

weight of intrinsically conductive polymer.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that a phosphated metallic material is

employed as metallic material in process step (a).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that an already corroded metallic

material is employed as metallic material in process
step (a). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the passivating medium comprises

an additional oxidizing agent or a mixture of such
oxidizing agents.
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in
that Fe(III) ions, ammonium peroxodisulphate, potassium

permanganate and/or hydrogen peroxide are/is employed
as additional oxidizing agent.
Use of an intrinsically conductive polymer to

polymer is applied by non-electrochemical means to

the dry weight of the applied polymer coating, and

brought into contact with a passivating medium

comprising oxygen-containing water for a period of
at least 30 seconds and preferably until the

equilibrium potential is reached,

conducted by bringing the metallic material for a

period of at least 1.5 minutes to a potential
