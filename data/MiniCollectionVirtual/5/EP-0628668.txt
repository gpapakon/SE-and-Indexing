<ABSTRACT>
A wall tie for use in securing a wall to a support, the wall tie being 
characterized by resilient grip means for attaching the wall tie to the 

support. In one embodiment, the grip means comprises first and second 
jaws (12, 14) resiliently biased towards one another such that, in use, the 

support is gripped between the jaws (12, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wall tie, more particularly to a wall tie for use 
in securing a wall to a parallel flange of a support member, for example 
a steel column or wind post. Wall ties are commonly used to secure brick or block built leaves of 
cavity walls to one another or to secure walls constructed of building 
bricks or blocks to support structures in order to strengthen the walls. 
One problem associated with wall ties for securing walls to support 
structures is that the thickness and/or sectional shape of the support 
structures is not uniform, and hence a variety of wall ties must be 
provided so that the correct type of wall tie can be used at a particular 
location. It is inconvenient to stock a large range of wall ties, and it is 
an object of the invention to provide a wall tie in which this 
disadvantage is reduced. A wall tie for use in securing a wall to a support is known from AU-B-518 132. According to the present invention there is provided a wall tie for use in 
securing a wall to a support, the wall tie comprising a pair of 
limbs one of the limbs being arranged to counter forces tending 
to move the wall away from the support, the other limb being arranged 
to counter forces tending to move the wall towards the support characterised in that, each limb is carrying a respective jaw, the jaws being resiliently 
biased towards one another such that, in use, the support is gripped 
therebetween. The provision of resilient grip means allows a standard wall tie to be 
used in conjunction with supports of varying thicknesses and section.  
 Preferably the wall tie is defined by a metal wire member in the form of 
a loop, the ends of the member extending generally perpendicular to the 
length of the tie adjacent one another and defining the first and second 
jaws respectively, the first and second jaws preferably extending 
generally parallel to one another. The loop is preferably of generally rectangular shape, the jaws being 
provided at a first short side thereof. Each of the long sides of the loop is 
preferably shaped so as to provide a point from which water can drip, in 
use. Preferably, the side opposite said first short side is of length greater than 
said first short side, the wire being smoothly curved at the junction of 
said side opposite said first short side and a long side to displace part of 
the long side outwardly. At least one of said jaws of the member is preferably reinforced. Such 
reinforcing may be achieved by shaping the member so that the end

<CLAIMS>
A wall tie for use in securing a wall to a support, the wall tie 
comprising a pair of limbs (18, 20) one of the limbs (18) being arranged to counter forces 

tending to move the wall away from the support, the other limb (20) 
being arranged to counter forces tending to move the wall towards the 

support characterised in that, each limb (18, 20) is 
carrying a respective jaw (12, 14), the jaws (12, 14) being resiliently 

biased towards one another such that, in use, the support is gripped 
therebetween. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the wall 
tie is defined by a metal wire member in the form of a loop (10), the 

ends of the member extending generally perpendicular to the length of 
the tie adjacent one another and defining the first and second jaws 

(12, 14) respectively. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the first 
and second jaws extend generally parallel to one another. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, characterized in 
that the loop is of generally rectangular shape, the jaws (12, 14) being 

provided at a first short side (16) thereof. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the side opposite said 
first short side (16) is of length greater than said first short side (16), the 

wire being smoothly curved at the junction of said side opposite said first 
short side (16) and a long side (20) to displace part of the long side (20) 

outwardly.  
 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein the part of 
the loop opposite said first and second jaws (12, 14) is of part circular 

form. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized in that 
each of the long sides (18, 20) of the loop (10) is shaped so as to provide 

a point from which water can drip, in use. 
A wall tie as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that at least one of said jaws (12, 14) is reinforced. 
A wall tie as claimed in Claim 8, characterized in that the at 
least one jaw (12, 14) is reinforced by shaping the member so that the 

end region thereof doubles back upon itself. 
A wall tie as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the end of the member defining one of the jaws (12) is bent 

around that region of the opposite limb of the member which terminates 
in the other jaw (14), such that said one jaw (12) comprises a pair of 

parallel elements. 
A wall tie as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the end of the member defining one of the jaws 

(14) comprises a first region (28) extending generally parallel to the other 
jaw (12), and a second region (30) extend away from said other jaw (12).
