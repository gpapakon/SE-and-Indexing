<ABSTRACT>
In a composite sealing material having an inner 
portion (2) and a carbon outer portion (3), bulk density of the 

carbon outer portion is set in a range of 0.3∼2.0 g/cm³, 
preferably in a range of 0.5∼1.5 g/cm³, or fiber members 

are mixed in the carbon outer portion, or an oil layer 
is arranged on the carbon outer portion, or an organic 

layer or an inorganic layer is arranged on the carbon 
outer portion, so as to improve sealing properties of 

sealing members formed by using the composite sealing 
materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite sealing
material body to be used in sealing members for valves,
pumps and the like.Generally, valves set in pipes for steam waters,
oils, chemicals and the like to be used in thermal power
plants and the like, are arranged in very narrow spaces,
high places, open-air spaces and the like. Therefore, it
is very difficult to effect exchanging operations of
sealing members of the valves. Moreover, various kinds
of valves are used in the thermal power plants, and
setting directions of the valves are varied as a
horizontal direction, an inclined direction, a vertical
direction and the like. From this point of view, it is
also difficult to effect the exchanging operations of the
sealing members.As the sealing members mentioned above, the 
composite sealing material comprising an inner portion
and an outer portion enveloping said inner portion, said
inner portion being composed of a small ceramic discrete
material and the like, and said outer portion being
composed of a carbon base material, has been disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 6-58,425 and
6-87,674 (U.S. Patent Application No. 8/68,674).The composite sealing material mentioned above has
at least a carbon outer portion, and thus it has
sufficient sealing properties for the sealing members of
the valves, the pumps and the like mentioned above, since
it is easily assembled and has good sealing properties.
However, if the sealing member is formed by arranging a
number of the composite sealing materials in a packing
box, and pressing the composite sealing materials,
sometimes the sealing members have insufficient
sealing properties.U.S. 2316778 discloses a metallic packing comprising
metal flakes coated with graphite. DE 503861 discloses
self-lubricating packing pastes containing e.g. graphite,
metal, fibres, grease and oil. GB-A-2077246 discloses
moldable graphite granules for producing graphite
products. It is an object of the present invention to reduce
or eliminate the drawbacks mentioned above and to provide
a composite sealing material body having improved sealing
properties.The present invention provides a composite sealing
material body according to claim 1.Preferably said carbon structure has a bulk density
in the range 0.3∼2.0 g/cm3.Preferably fibers are mixed in said carbon
structure.Preferably the carbon structure is porous and an oil
layer is impregnated in said porous carbon structure.By the constructions mentioned above, it is possible
to improve sealing properties of the
