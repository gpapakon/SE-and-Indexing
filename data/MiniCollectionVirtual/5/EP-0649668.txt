<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire-proof 
protective wearing outfits for activities which involve 
a risk of burns, for example, urban, industrial and 
forest fire-fighting activities, as well as industrial 
activities which are carried out in the presence of 
molten metal, combustibles or high voltages, military 
and police activities, and for use by drivers of motor 
vehicles, aircraft pilots, as well as for sport 
activities and/or other heavy duties. The invention results from studies and tests 
carried out by the Applicant in relation to the problem 
of safety in carrying out the activities identified 
above. The Applicant has identified a set of basic 
principles (some of which are contrary to current 
technical thinking in this field) which must be 
satisfied in order to provide the best solution to the 
aforesaid problems and which have brought to the 
provision of a protective outfit forming the subject of 
Italian patent no. 1.238.868 and parallel US patent no. 
5.172.426 and European patent no. 433.991. A first important principle, the identification of 
which forms the basis of the above identified previous 
patent, lies in that a safety outfit should be thought 
of as the combination of all the items of clothing 
which separate the skin of the person wearing the 
outfit from the outside environment. This finding had 
been previously completed ignored by designers in this 
sector. In fact, designers had always limited 
themselves to providing an outer protective covering 
for the person without paying attention to the 
undergarments.  A second important principle which also had always 
been ignored previously in the design of safety 
outfits, is the need to provide an outfit which is 
comfortable to wear and is tolerable throughout the 
period during which it is in use. In other words, 
comfort should be considered to be a safety factor, not 
only because an intolerable garment is not worn but 
also because the use of an outfit which is tiring to 
wear generally reduces the attentiveness of the person, 
whereas attentiveness is one of his main protections 
against accidents. Moreover, uncomfortable and heavy 
clothing which causes heavy perspiration helps to 
create the microclimatic conditions which favour heat-stroke. A further important consideration which should be 
taken into account in the design of safety outfits is 
that the classification of the seriousness of a burn 
depends not only - as it was thought previously - on 
the extent and depth of the burn (outfits known 
previously
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Protective fire-proof outfit for activities 
involving a risk of burns, having the following 

characteristics, in combination: 

a) the outfit is constituted by various garment 
components which are at least partially superposed on 

each other so as to provide a different degree of 
protection for different regions of the body of the 

person wearing the outfit, 
b) the outfit has a small area of minimum 
protection in correspondence with at least one more 

heat-resistant region of the body of the person wearing 
the outfit, constituting an area where the outside 

temperature can be detected so that the person can 
become aware of the ambient temperature promptly, 
c) in the regions of greatest protection, as a 
result of the superposition of the various garment 

components, the outfit has an outer layer of fire-proof 
fabric superposed on at least one layer of mesh made of 

a fire-proof yarn and at least one layer of net made of 
fire-proof yarn, the layers being formed so as to 

facilitate the transfer of heat from the outside 
environment to the skin of the person wearing the 

outfit by radiation but to keep to a minimum the 
transfer of heat by conduction, 

   said outfit being further characterized in that the 
garment components of which it is made are configured, 

constituted and arranged in such a way as to provide a 
different degree of air-permeability in different 

regions of the outfit. 
Outfit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it has at least one region with greater air-permeability 

in correspondence with the trunk. 
Outfit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that each garment component forming the outfit is made 

 
of materials provided with air-permeability and 

characteristics suitable to ensure evaporation of the 
sweat produced at each of the corresponding body 

regions. 
Method for designing an outfit according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the air-permeability of 

each region of the outfit is determined on the basis of 
a computerized program which provides a relation 

between the energy waste required when carrying the 
specific activity to which the outfit is directed and 

the amount of sweat produced at each body region. 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the materials to be used for the various portions 

of the outfit are tested by an air-permeability 
measuring apparatus, said apparatus including a 

container (1) kept at physiological temperature by a 
thermostatic control system, in w
hich a known amount of 
liquid is introduced which has a salt composition 

similar to that of human sweat, a system of 
communicating vessels (3) connected to the container 

(1) which allows for constant levelling of the liquid 
within the container while the test is being carried 

out, a surface ventilation system (4) for the fabric 
sample, which allows the air current present in the 

actual operative environment to be simulated, and a 
climatic chamber (5) in which all the above-mentioned 

components are located, which simulates all the 
climatic parameters observed in the operative 

environment.
