<DESCRIPTION>
 BACKGROUND OFTHE INVENTIONDEGRADATION RESISTANT DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS BASED ON CELLULASE ENZYMESField of inventionThe present invention relates to detergent compositions which have improved degradation resistance to cotton fabrics. More particularly, the present invention relates to detergent compositions containing a cellulase composition comprising a combination of exo- cellobiohydrolase I type cellulase components and endoglucanase cellulase components wherein the exo-cellobiohydrolase I type cellulase components are enriched relative to the endoglucanse type cellulase components. Such detergent compositions provide excellent cleaning, especially of cotton garments, while also providing substantially reduced degradation of the cotton fabric in the garment.State of the ArtCellulases are known in the art as enzymes that hydroiyze cellulose (β-1 ,4-glucan linkages) thereby resulting in the formation of glucose, cellobiose, cellooligosaccharide, and the like. While cellulases are produced in fungi, bacteria and the like, those produced by fungi have been given the most attention because fungi typically produce a complete cellulase system capable of degrading crystalline forms of cellulose, and such cellulases can be readily produced in large quantities via fermentation procedures.In regard to the above, "Methods in Enzyrπology", 160. 25, pages 234-242 (1988) discloses that certain fungi produce cellulase 

systems which are comprised of several different enzyme components including those identified as exo-cellobiohydroiases (EC 3.2.1.91 ) ("CBH"), endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) ("EG"), β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21 ) ("BG"). Moreover, these classes can be further separated into individual components. For example, multiple CBHs and EGs have been isolated from a variety of bacterial and fungal sources including T. reesei which contains 2 CBHs, i.e., CBH I and CBH II, and at least 3 EGs, i.e., EG I, EG II and EG III. The ratio of CBH I type components to EG type components (including ail of the EG type components) in naturally occurring cellulases does not appear to exceed about 5:1 . For example, see Brown et al., Genetic Control of Environmental Pollutants, Gilbert S. Omenn Editor, Chapter -- "Microbial Enzymes and Ligno- Celluiase Utilization", Hollaeπder Publishing Corp. Variations in this ratio can result from the use of different microorganisms, depending upon the characteristics of the strain, but in any event such ratios still do not exceed about 5:1.The complete cellulase system comprising CBH, EG and
