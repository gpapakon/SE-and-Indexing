Method for coating the bent corner areas of frame-like 
spacer elements (10) with radiused corners (11, 12, 

13, 14) for multi-glazing units, 
where the spacer elements (10) are transported in 

upright condition on a horizontal conveyor (1, 2, 3) 
along a path extending between a pair of nozzles, the 

mutually aligned outlets (9) of which are arranged to 
face each other, and are coated during this movement 

on the flanks of that leg (15) of the spacer element, 
which rests on the horizontal conveyor (1, 2, 3),
characterised in that
 the spacer element (10) is 
lowered and then lifted again together with the 

section (1, 2) of the horizontal conveyor that 
supports the spacer element, and that simultaneously 

with at least one of these two movements the spacer 
element is additionally moved in horizontal direction 

(8) so that the line of alignment of the nozzle 
outlets (9) does not leave the flanks of the spacer 

element (10), which exhibit a curved shape in the area 
of the respective corners (11, 12, 13, 14), while 

simultaneously coating material is ejected from the 
nozzles.  

 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
corner area (11, 12, 13, 14) is coated while the 

section (1, 2) of the horizontal conveyor is being 
lifted. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 while being coated in its corner areas (11, 12, 
13, 14) the spacer element (10) is maintained at rest, 

relative to the section (1, 2) of the horizontal 
conveyor by which it is supported, with the conveyor 

drive in switched-off condition, and that instead the 
section (1, 2) of the horizontal conveyor, together 

with a carrier of that section (1, 2) are guided 
together along a curved path of movement. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the spacer (10) is pivoted repeatedly about an 
axis located near the nozzles and extending in 

parallel to the line of alignment of their outlets (9) 
so that all sides (15, 16, 17, 18) of the spacer 

element (10) come to lie successively on the 
horizontal conveyor (1, 2, 3) for being coated. 
Device for coating the bent corner areas (11, 12, 13, 
14) of frame-like spacer elements (10) with radiused 

corners (11, 12, 13, 14) for multi-glazing units,
 
having a horizontal conveyor (1, 2, 3) on which the 

spacer elements (10) are passed in upright condition  
 

between a pair of nozzles, the mutually aligned 
outlets (9) of which are arranged to face each other 

and are arranged a little above the level of the 
horizontal conveyor (2), and are coated during this 

movement on the flanks of that leg (15) of the spacer 
element, which rests on the horizontal conveyor (1, 2, 

3),
characterised in that
 at least the section (1, 2) of 
the horizontal conveyor adjacent the inlet end of the 

nozzles is supported for being lifted and lowered and 
is equipped with a drive for the lifting and lowering 

movement. 
Device according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the 
liftable and lowerable section (1, 2) of the 

horizontal conveyor can additionally be moved forth 
and back in the conveying direction (8) and is 

equipped for this purpose with a drive (24) separate 
of the conveyor drive. 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 a 
common drive (24) is provided for the lifting and 

lowering movement and for the forward and backward 
movement of the section (1, 2) of the horizontal 

conveyor.  
 
Device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the 
section (1, 2) of the horizontal conveyor is seated on 

eccentric shafts (21, 22) extending substantially in 
horizontal direction and transversely to the conv
eying 
direction (8). 
Device according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the 
eccentric shafts (21, 22) can be actuated 

synchronously via a common drive (24). 
Device according to any of claims 5 to 9, 

characterised in that
 a stop (19), that can be 
retracted clear of the conveyor path, is provided in 

the neighbourhood of the nozzles and that the forward 
end of the side (16) of the spacer element (10) comes 

to abut against that stop when being positioned 
between the outlets (9) of the nozzles. 
Device according to any of claims 5 to 10, 

characterised in that
 at least one roller (25), that 
can be swung clear of the conveyor path, is arranged 

in the neighbourhood of the nozzles, which roller in 
its active position urges the lower side (15) of the 

spacer element against the upper surface of the 
horizontal conveyor (2).
