<ABSTRACT>
A security spacer (24) is used with a U-lock (16) to provide additional security. The U-lock (16) includes a U-shaped bar (18) and a header (20). In certain circumstances, the arms of the U-lock (16) are sufficiently longer than the object (10) being locked that a gap (22) between the object (10) and header (20) is wide enough to allow a thief to insert a scissors jack between the arms and break the lock. The security spacer (24) substantially fills the gap to prevent the insertion of a jack and is held in place by the header (20). The security spacer (24) preferably includes two oval cylinders (26) connected at opposite ends of a metal bar (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
 U-LOCK SECURITY SPACERField of the InventionThis invention relates to "the field of locks. More particularly, this invention relates to U-lockε which are commonly used for bicycles.Background of the InventionU-locks are commonly used for locking a bicycle to prevent theft of the bicycle. Ordinarily, a rider locks the bicycle frame and at least one wheel to a post. Often, an experienced rider will remove the front wheel of the bicycle in order to lock it as well.A U-lock locks principally includes a bar which has been formed into a U-shape and a removable header. The header is rectangular bar and includes a passive hole and -a locking hole ■each -space about one inch from opposite ends of the header. A rotating lock is fitted in the end of the header.The U-bar is formed of metal bar stock formed into a U-shape whose arms are in the range of four to six inches apart. A first arm includes a 90° bend which is positioned about one inch from its end forming a short bar section. The second arm is formed to properly mate with the rotating lock of the header.To lock the U-lock, the short bar section is placed into the passive hole and the U-bar and the header are rotated about the 90° bend relative to one another so that the entire short bar section is pushed inside the header and the second end of the U- bar enters the locking hole. The rotating lock is then activated by a key to prevent the second end of the lock from being removed from the header thereby securely holding the lock closed.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 During use, the ends of the U-bar are customarily, passed around a post and around a portion of the frame and one tire (or both) of a bicycle. It is impossible to predict the thickness of the post to which a rider may desire to lock a bicycle. Further, bicycles are available with a variety sizes for frame tubes, frame tube spacing tires and wheels. U-locks are also used to lock motorcyles, boats, jetskis and many other objects. It is possible and likely that the U-bar of such a lock is longer than the combined dimension of the bicycle, tire and post. This excess length may be long enough to allow an unscrupulous persons to insert an automobile jack between the arms of the u-bar. Because a jack is designed to lift the weight of an automobile, it is sufficiently strong to cause the U-lock to fail simply by opening the lock. A practiced thief can pre-size the jack to the proper spacing of a U-lock so that the jack need only be expanded and complete such a theft in approximately twenty seconds.Summary of the

What is claimed is: 1. An apparatus for use with a U-lock having a U-shaped bar with two arms and a header wherein the arms may be longer than an object being locked thereby providing a gap between the U-lock and the header, the apparatus comprising: a) spacer means detachably coupled to each arm for substantially filling the gap; and b) header means coupled to an end of each arm for securing the spacer means to the U-lock.
2. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the spacer means comprises: a) a pair of cylinders for receiving the arms; and b) means for coupling the two cylinders to one another.
3. The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the means for coupling comprises a metal plate.
4. The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the cylinders are ovals.
5. The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the spacer means comprises a loop of sufficient size to pass around the arms but not the header.
6. An improved U-lock of the type having a U-shaped bar with two arms and a lockable detachable header wherein the arms are passed through or around an object being secured by the U-lock and further wherein the arms may be longer than an object being secured by the U-lock thereby providing a gap between

 the object and the header wherein the improvement comprises spacer means for filling the gap and means for securing the spacer means to the U-lock.
7. The apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the spacer means comprises: a) a pair of apertured members for receiving the arms; and b) means for coupling the two cylinders to one another.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the means for coupling comprises a metal plate.
9. The apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the cylinders are ovals.
10. The apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the spacer means comprises a loop of sufficient size to pass around the arms but not the header.
11. A locking apparatus comprising: a) a U-shaped bar having two spaced apart arms with a space therebetween; b) at least one detachable spacer apparatus having: 1) two appertured ends, one end each to receive one of the arms; and 2) spanning means coupled between the ends for blocking a portion of the space; and c) a header having two header apertures, each header aperture adapted to receive an end of one of the arms, the header for securing the spacer to the U-shaped bar.
