<ABSTRACT>
An etching solution comprises organic acid and hydrogen 
peroxide mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1 to 200:1 with basic 

material added thereto to an amount that adjust the pH. The 
etching solution presents an eminent difference in the 

etching rate between GaAs/AlGaAs, GaAs/InGaAs, 
AlGaAs/InGaAs, InGaAs/AlGaAs, and InGaAs/GaAs, and a high 

selectivity etching is enabled easily and at high 
preciseness. Therefore, a precise control of an etching for 

a heterostructure semiconductor is enabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to etching solution used 
for etching semiconductor and etching method using this 
etching solution. Conventionally, acid and hydrogen peroxide, base and 
hydrogen peroxide, or oxidation-reduction pair is employed 
as etching solution for etching semiconductor. Figure 17 is 
a cross sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device 
to which an etching is carried out using the prior art 
etching solution. In the figure, reference numeral 1 
designates an n type AlGaAs layer. An n⁺ type GaAs layer 2 
is disposed on the n type AlGaAs layer 1. A photoresist 3 
is disposed on the n⁺ type GaAs layer 2. Reference 
character d designates an etching depth to that the n⁺ type 
GaAs layer 2 is etched and reference character Δd 
designates an over etching depth to that the n type AlGaAs 
layer 1 is excessively etched. Figure 18 is a cross sectional view illustrating an 
HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) produced by 
employing a prior art etching solution. In the figure, the 
same reference numerals as in figure 17 designate the same 
elements. Reference numeral 4 designates a GaAs substrate.  
 
An i type GaAs layer 5 is disposed on the GaAs substrate 4. 
An i type InGaAs layer 6 is disposed on the i type GaAs 
layer 5. The n type AlGaAs layer 1 and the n⁺ type GaAs 
layer 2 are disposed on the i type GaAs layer 5 in figure 
17. A drain electrode 7 and a source electrode 8 are 
disposed on the n⁺ type GaAs layer 2. The threshold voltage Vth of this HEMT is represented 
by the following formula (1): 
where 
B:Schottky barrier height W:thickness of AlGaAs layer ND:donor concentration in AlGaAs layer ΔEc:energy discontinuity of the conduction band 
between AlGaAs and GaAs ε:dielectric constant of AlGaAs  
   A description is given of the prior art etching method. When a mixed solution of phosphoric acid, hydrogen 
peroxide, and water in a volume ratio of 3:1:50 is employed 
as an etching solution in figures 17 and 18, the etching 
speeds of the n⁺ type GaAs layer 2 and the n type AlGaAs 
layer 1 are both about 30 nm/min., and therefore, when this 
etching solution is applied to producing a gate recess of 
HEMT, there arises a variation Δd in the recess depth (d) in 
figures 17 and 18.  Since the thickness W of the AlGaAs layer 1 which 
appears in the formula (1) defining the threshold voltage 
Vth of the HEMT, is determined by the recess depth (d), the 
thickness W of the AlGaAs layer 1 varies when the recess 
depth (d) varies as described above, occurring a variation in
