<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an inflatable body, such as a 
lifting body, comprising a fiber reinforced elastomer body 

which is flat in unflated condition and has in inflated 
condition a mechanical equilibrium shape that is predominantly 

geometrically continuous, non-spherical and non-cylindrical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an inflatable body,
comprising a fiber reinforced elastomer body. Inflatable
bodies are particularly suitable as lifting bodies, as
pressure vessels for gaseous, liquified or liquid materials or
for blocking leaks and the like.
An inflatable body having the features as set forth in the
preamble portion of claim 1 is known for example from
US-A-4,036,472.Lifting bodies are used for lifting heavy objects, for
example parts of collapsed structures under which persons have
become wedged. The cause thereof can be heavy earthquakes,
collapsing of buildings, airplane disasters, train accidents
and the like. In such situations usually only a very narrow
entrance is present for applying a lifting apparatus. In such
situations inflatable lifting bodies, or bags, are used, which
are very flat in a non-inflated condition.Other applications of the use of lifting bags, or lifting
bodies, are moving heavy machines, for example in the mining
industry, changing tyres, lifting and levelling of buildings,
re-railing of locos and lorries, but also in construction for
forcing steel beams apart or for pressing together of ship
segments/plates for welding works.In the art generally two types of lifting bags are
distinguished, namely high pressure and low pressure bags. The
group of low pressure bags gives an equal lifting capacity
over the total lifting height. Furthermore, because of the
limited forces per unit area there will be no damage of weak
surfaces. The lifting capacity depends on the size of the
contact area.A low pressure bag usually operates at an air pressure of
about 0.2 till 1.0 bar in excess of atmospheric pressure and
acts on a large area. Usually lifting heights are available
from about 25 cm to 300 cm with lifting capacities up to about
16 tonnes. The high pressure lifting bags give a high lifting
capacity on a relatively small area, with a limited lifting
height.The high pressure bags, usually prepared from vulcanized
rubber reinforced with high tensile polyamide cord operate at
air pressures in excess of 5 bars, up to 12 bars. The lifting
capacities of those high pressure bags usually range from over
10, up to 75 tonnes. The maximum lifting height is however
limited and the force exerted by the bag acts at a small area,
so that weak surfaces could become damaged. Additionally, the
high pressure lifting bags have the property that they change
in geometry when inflated, from a flat, rectangular shape, via
a pillow shape, to a spherical shape, when fully inflated, as
this
