<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention was to select strains of the Trichoderma species having an inhibitory activity against a large spectrum of lignopathogenic and phytopathogenic fungi, the development of a fungicide and a process for using the same. Thanks to the selection of 3 new strains of Trichoderma: Trichoderma sp. LC1, LC2 and LC3, fungi have been selected which totally inhibit the most important wood destroyers according to EN 113. In addition, they inhibit important phytopathogenic fungi. A fungicide based on the use of the 3 Trichoderma strains is applied by spraying, dipping or in an immobilized form. When applied on wood, an incubating phase is also part of the invention.
