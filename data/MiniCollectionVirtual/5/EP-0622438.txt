<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic corundum abrasive is improved by the addition of tin. It is preferably prepared by the sol-gel method, there being already present in the sol further modifying components such as magnesium, lithium, cobalt, yttrium, hafnium, iron, rare earths, gamma-aluminium oxide.

<CLAIMS>
Abrasive which consists essentially of sintered
polycrystalline ceramic corundum and is obtainable

by the sol-gel process, characterized in that the
sintered corundum contains more than 0.01% by weight

of tin, calculated as tin oxide, as constituent of
the polycrystalline structure.
Abrasive according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the tin content, calculated as tin oxide, does not

lie above 5% by weight.
Abrasive according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that it contains magnesium.
Abrasive according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that it contains lithium.
Abrasive according to Claim 4, characterized in that
the lithium content is at least 2% by weight, calculated

as lithium oxide.
Abrasive according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that it contains cobalt, yttrium, hafnium,

iron and/or rare earths.
Abrasive according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that in the polished section it comprises

two particle fractions of significantly different
size and having an average dimensional ratio of at

least 3 : 1.
Abrasive according to Claim 7, characterized in that
the tin and optionally the lithium is present in the

smaller particles in a greater proportion than in
the larger ones.
Abrasive according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that at least the smaller particles have a submicron

average size.
Grinding tool characterized in that it contains an
abrasive according to one of Claims 1 to 9.
Grinding tool according to Claim 10, characterized
in that at least 5% by weight of the abrasive

present therein is the abrasive according to one of
Claims 1 to 9.
Grinding tool according to Claim 10 or 11, characterized
in that it additionally contains one or more

abrasives of high hardness such as diamond, cubic
boron nitrite [sic]
 and/or silicon carbite [sic].
Process for preparing a ceramic corundum abrasive
comprising the steps:


a) preparation of a sol containing an aluminium hydroxide
as starting material, where a suspension is prepared

by addition of demineralized water and nitric
acid to the starting material and the suspension is

centrifuged to remove coarse material present,
b) conversion of the sol into a gel,
c) drying and/or calcination of the gel,
d) crushing and optionally classification of the dried
or calcined intermediate,
e) sintering of the crushed intermediate,

characterized in that a tin-containing material is
added to the sol in step a) or to the gel in step b)

in such an amount that the sintered material
obtained in step e) contains more than 0.01% by

weight of tin, calculated as tin oxide.
Process according to Claim 13, characterized in that
a material containing tin is present in the sol in

finely divided, solid and/or dissolved form. 
Process according to Claim 13 or 14, characterized
in that the sol contains γ-aluminium oxide.
Process according to one of Claims 13 to 15, characterized
in that a material containing lithium is

present in the sol in finely divided, solid and/or
dissolved form.
Process according to one of Claims 13 to 16, characterized
in that magnesium is present in the sol in

finely divided, solid and/or dissolved form.
Process according to one of Claims 13 to 17, characterized
in that sintering is carried out for from

1 to 20 minutes at from 1100°C to 1600°C.
