 TITLE ENZYMATIC PREPARATION OF N-(PHOSPHONOMETHYL)GLYCINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention:This invention relates to a process for the production of mixtures of glyoxylic acid and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and the subsequent production of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, commonly called glyphosate. More specifically, the present invention relates to an enzymatic process involving the reaction of glycolic acid and oxygen in aqueous solution in the presence of AMPA and catalysts consisting of glycolate oxidase ((S)-2-hydroxy acid oxidase, EC 1.1.3.15) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) to produce a mixture containing glyoxylic acid and AMPA in situ which mixture is then hydrogenated to yield N- (phosphonomethyl)glycine, a broad-spectrum, post-emergent phytotoxicant and herbicide useful in controlling the growth of a wide variety of plants.2. Description of the Related Art:Glycolate oxidase, an enzyme commonly found in leafy green plants and mammalian cells, catalyzes the oxidation of glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid, with the concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide:HOCH2C02H + 02 ~-> OCHC02H + H202N. E. Tolbert et al., J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 181, 905-914 (1949) first reported an enzyme, extracted from tobacco leaves, which catalyzed the oxidation of glycolic acid to formic acid and C02 via the intermediate formation of glyoxylic acid. The addition of certain compounds, such as ethylenediamine, limited the further oxidation of the intermediate glyoxylic acid. The oxidations were carried out at a pH of about 8, typically using glycolic acid concentrations of about 3-40 mM (millimolar). The optimum pH for the glycolate oxidation was reported to be 8.9. Oxalic acid (100 mM) was reported to inhibit the catalytic action of the glycolate oxidase. Similarly, K. E. Richardson and N. E. Tolbert, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 236, 1280-1284 (1961) showed that buffers containing tris(hydroxymethyl)amino- methane (TRIS) inhibited the formation of oxalic acid in the glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid. C. O. Clagett, N. E. Tolbert and R. H. Burris, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 178, 977-987 (1949) reported that the optimum pH for the 

 glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid with oxygen was about 7.8 - 8.6, and the optimum temperature was 35-40°C.I. Zelitch and S. Ochoa, J. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 201, 707-718 (1953), and J. C. Robinson et al.. J. Biol. Chem.. Vol.237, 2001-2009 (1962), reported that the formation of formic acid and Cθ2 in the spinach glycolate oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of
