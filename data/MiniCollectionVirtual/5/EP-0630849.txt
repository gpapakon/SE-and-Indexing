<ABSTRACT>
In the invention, a rotating elevator 
motor (6) provided with a traction sheave 

(18) is placed in the counterweight (26) 
of an elevator suspended with ropes (2). 

The sector-shaped stator (14) of the 
motor (6) has a diameter (2*Rs) larger 

than that (2*Rv) of the traction sheave 
(18) and the elevator ropes (2) are 

passed through the open part or parts 
(27) of the stator. This structure allows 

the use of traction sheaves (18) of different 
diameters with rotors (17) of the 

same diameter. Still, the length of the 
motor remains small and the motor/counterweight 

of the invention can be accommodated 
in the space normally reserved 

for a counterweight in an elevator shaft. 
The motor shaft (13) is placed in the 

counterweight (26) substantially midway 
between the guide rails (8) and the same 

number of ropes (2) are placed on both 
sides of the rotor (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the counterweight of a
rope-suspended elevator moving along guide rails and to an
elevator drive machinery/motor placed in the counterweight,
said motor comprising a traction sheave, a bearing, an
element supporting the bearing, a shaft, a stator provided
with a winding and a rotating rotor.Traditionally, an elevator machinery consists of a hoisting
motor which, via a gear, drives the traction sheaves around
which the hoisting ropes of the elevator are passed. The
hoisting motor, elevator gear and traction sheaves are
generally placed in a machine room above the elevator shaft.
They can also be placed beside or under the elevator shaft.
Another known solution is to place the elevator machinery in
the counterweight of the elevator. Previously known is also
the use of a linear motor as the hoisting machine of an
elevator and its placement in the counterweight.Conventional elevator motors, e.g. cage induction, slip ring
or d.c. motors, have the advantage that they are simple and
that their characteristics and the associated technology
have been developed during several decades and have reached
a reliable level. In addition, they are advantageous in
respect of price. A system with a traditional elevator
machinery placed in the counterweight is presented e.g. in
publication US 3101130. A drawback with the placement of the
elevator motor in this solution is that it requires a large
cross-sectional area of the elvator shaft.Using a linear motor as the hoisting motor of an elevator
involves problems beacause either the primary part or the
secondary part of the motor has to be as long as the shaft.
Therefore, linear motors are expensive to use as elevator
motors. A linear motor for an elevator, placed in the counterweight,
is presented e.g. in publication US 5062501. However, 
a linear motor placed in the counterweight has certain
advantages, e.g. that no machine room is needed and that the
motor requires but a relatively small cross-sectional area
of the counterweight.The motor of an elevator may also be of the external-rotor
type, with the traction sheave joined directly with the
rotor. Such a structure is presented e.g. in publication US
4771197. The motor is gearless. The problem with this structure
is that, to achieve a sufficient torque, the length and
diameter of the motor have to be increased. In the structure
presented in US 4771197, the length of the motor is further
increased by the brake, which is placed alongside of the
rope grooves. Moreover, the blocks supporting
