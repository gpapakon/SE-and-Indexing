<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed here are a filter medium for a metal hot 
melt which is obtained by precipitating needle-shaped 

crystals on the surfaces of ceramic fillers; and a treatment 
process of the metal hot melt which comprises the steps of 

using the ceramic fillers on the surfaces of which needle-shaped 
crystals are precipit
ated, and bringing the metal hot 
melt into contact with the ceramic fillers. The employment 

of the filter medium can lead to the improvement of a filter 
performance of the ceramic fillers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter medium for a 
metal hot melt suitable for removing solid impurities from the 
hot melt of a metal such as aluminum by filtration, and a 
treatment process for the metal hot melt. For example, thin plates or foils of aluminum can be 
manufactured by first casting an aluminum hot melt into ingot, 
and then rolling this ingot. However, solid impurities such 
as metal oxides and fine pieces of a refectory contained in the 
aluminum hot melt are directly introduced into the ingot 
sometimes, so that pinholes and surface imperfections occur in 
the course of the manufacture of the thin plates, the foils or 
the like by rolling the ingot. In order to prevent these 
troubles, it is necessary to remove the solid impurities from 
the metal hot melt, and as means for this prevention, various 
hot melt treatment methods have been heretofore developed. 
Among such methods, there are known hot melt treatment 
techniques in which alumina balls shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are  
 
utilized. Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of a device for use in the hot 
melt treatment process using the alumina balls, and this is a 
two-step device having two hot melt treatment chambers. An aluminum hot melt A is introduced into a first 
treatment chamber 3 through an inlet 1, and then brought into 
contact with alumina balls 4 filled into the first treatment 
chamber 3 to collect solid impurities (contaminants) in the 
aluminum hot melt A. This first treatment 
chamber 3 is divided by a partition 2 into a pretreatment 
chamber 3a in which the aluminum hot melt A is first subjected 
to a contact treatment and an after-treatment chamber 3b in 
which the aluminum hot melt A is then brought into contact with 
the alumina balls 4 at the time of its discharge. An argon gas 
B and a nitrogen gas C are fed into the pretreatment chamber 
3a through a blow nozzle 5 provided through the bottom of the 
pretreatment chamber 3a so as to remove gases contained in the 
aluminum hot melt A therefrom. The aluminum hot melt A which 
has been treated in the first treatment chamber 3 in this way 
is then introduced into a second treatment chamber 6. This 
second treatment chamber 6 has the same constitution as in the 
first treatment chamber 3, and in the second chamber 6, about 
the same treatment as in the first treatment chamber 3 is  
 
carried out. However, in a pretreatment chamber 6a of the 
second treatment chamber 6, a flaky alumina 7 is put on the 
alumina balls 4 to effectively remove sodium and the like 
contained
