<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a hymenoptera
venom or a proteinaceous or polypeptide component contained
therein in the manufacture of a medicament for treating DNA
virus infections.The use of venoms of various origin as components in medicaments
is of long standing. Dilute solutions of different
hymenoptera venoms are used for injection in immune therapy
for patients who are allergic to the stings of the insects.
Also, dilute solutions of the venoms are used as allergens by
application to the skin in testing for allergy. In recent
time, bee venom has been used in the management of certain
types of bronchial asthma (Kirusha VP et al., Ter. Arkh. 60
(1988), 81 - 84: Organisation and Results of Treatment Of
Bronchial Asthma Patients in the District of Vologda) and in
the management of syringomyelia and various related conditions
(Ludyanskii EA, Zh. Nevropatol. Psikhiatr. 91 (1991),
102 - 03. Other diseases in which bee venom has been used or
tested are multiple sclerosis, arthritis and diseases which
influence the coagulation properties of the blood. Other
hymenoptera venoms have been suggested for treatment and
prophylaxis of gingivitis. WO 91/08753 (to Gesellschaft f√ºr
Strahlen- und Umweltforschung MBH) discloses the use of an
agent comprising at least one hymenoptera venom or a component
thereof in the treatment of retroviral infections, in
particular HIV infection, in a mammal. US 4,822,608 (to Vespa
Laboratories, Inc.) discloses the use of at least one
hymenoptera venom or a component thereof in combination with 
an antibiotic agent in the treatment of mammalian infections,
including bacterial, viral, and cancerous infections.Combating virus infections is important not only in mammals.
Thus, in poultry breeding virus infections may impart considerable
losses.One of the most promising agents for the treatment of virus
infections caused i.a. by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2
and varicella-zoster virus is known as acyclovir (Whitley RJ,
et al., N Engl J Med 327 (1992), 782 - 89: Acyclovir: A
Decade Later). In herpes genitalis, oral or intravenous therapy
with acyclovir which are considered more effective than
topical application of acyclovir does not reduce the frequency
of recurrences. Although the indications for acyclovir
therapy expand, the appearance of isolates resistant to
acyclovir underscores the need for continued development of
new agents with new mechanisms of action.Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to
provide an improved medicament and method for the
