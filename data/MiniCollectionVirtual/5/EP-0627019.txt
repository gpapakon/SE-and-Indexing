A method of thermochemical heat treatment of case hardening steels in which
an edge region of a workpiece, in particular cup tappets, rolling bearing parts,

transmission and clutch elements, is enriched with carbon and nitrogen and
then subjected to martensitic hardening, characterised by


a first step of carbonitriding (1) at a temperature of 780 to 1050° C whereby
the edge region is carburised to 0.4 to 0.9 percent by weight of carbon and

nitrided to 0.1 to 0.8 percent by weight of nitrogen with a holding time of of 1
to 4 hours,
a second step of quenching (2) to a temperature well below the initial

martensite point of the edge region,
a third step of tempering (3) at a temperature higher than a nitrocarburising
temperature by 20 to 40° C at a heating rate of 10 to 30° C per minute and a

holding time of 1 to 2 hours,
a fourth step of cooling (4) to ambient temperature,
a fifth step of shaping the workpieces by machining (5),
a sixth step of nitrocarburising (6) in a gas mixture of ammonia, carbon
dioxide, nitrogen and endothermic or exothermic gas at a temperature of 500 to

620° C with a holding time of 60 to 150 minutes, and
a last step of cooling to ambient temperature.
A method of thermochemical heat treatment of case hardening steels
according to Claim 1, wherein nitrocarburising (6) is performed at a temperature

of 530 to 570° C.
A method of thermochemical heat treatment of case hardening steels
according to Claim 1, wherein nitrocarburising is performed in plasma or in a

salt bath. 
A method of thermochemical heat treatment of case hardening steels in which
