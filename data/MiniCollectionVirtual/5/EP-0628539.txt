<ABSTRACT>
A method and compounds for inhibiting the formation of scale and 
controlling corrosion is disclosed. The method is particularly effective at 

inhibiting the formation and deposition of calcium scales in circulating 
aqueous systems such as cooling waters systems, as well as inhibiting or 

preventing corrosion of ferrous-based metals in contact with aqueous 
systems. The method comprises introducing into the aqueous system a 

compound of the general formula: 

wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or substituted aryl; R' 
and R'' are each independently hydrogen, C₁₋₄ alkyl or C₁₋₄ substituted 

alkyl; Z is NH, NR, O or S where R is as described above; n is a positive 
integer greater than 1; f is a positive integer; and each M independantly is H, 

a water soluble cation ( e.g.,NH₄⁺, alkali metal), or a C₁-C₃ alkyl group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of water to inhibit
the formation of scale. More particularly, the present invention relates to
the use of a modified polyepoxysuccinic acid to inhibit scale formation
and prevent corrosion of ferrous-based metals in contact with aqueous
systems.In industrial cooling systems, water such as from rivers, lakes,
ponds, etc., is employed as the cooling media for heat exchangers. Such
natural waters contain large amounts of suspended materials such as silt,
clay, and organic wastes. The cooling water from heat exchangers is
typically passed through a cooling tower, spray pond or evaporative
system prior to discharge or reuse. In these systems, the cooling effect is
achieved by evaporating a portion of the water passing through the system.
Because of the evaporation which takes place during cooling, 
suspended materials in the water become concentrated. Fouling materials
from the feedwater or as a result of evaporative concentration can
settle in locations of low flow rate and cause corrosion and inefficient
heat transfer. Agglomerating agents such as polyacrylamides and polyacrylates
have been used to agglomerate fine particles of mud and silt
into a loose floc for removal. However, these flocs tend to settle in cooling
tower basins and frequent cleaning is necessary to remove the settled
flocs from the tower basins.The water employed in industrial cooling water systems also often
contains dissolved salts of calcium and magnesium, etc., which can lead
to scale and sludge deposits. One of the most common scale deposits in
cooling water systems is calcium carbonate. It normally results from the
breakdown of calcium bicarbonate, a naturally occurring soluble salt.
Calcium carbonate has a relatively low solubility and its solubility decreases
with increasing temperature and pH. Thus, the rate of calcium
carbonate deposition increases with increasing pH and temperature.Deposit control agents such as phosphates, phosphonates and
polyacrylates are often used to inhibit calcium carbonate scale formation
in industrial cooling water systems. The use of polyacrylates alone is not
effective at high calcium concentrations because undesirable polyacrylate-calcium
precipitates are formed reducing efficiency.Although phosphonates are very effective at controlling calcium
carbonate scale formation, and certain phosphonates exhibit excellent
calcium tolerance, i.e. the ability to inhibit calcium carbonate scale in
water having a propensity toward scale deposition, they can
