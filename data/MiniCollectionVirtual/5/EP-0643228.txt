<ABSTRACT>
Known clamping devices which operate with radially compressible sleeves permit clamping only when the sleeve is subjected to pressure. It is proposed to assign, to a first radially compressible slit actuation region (4) of a sleeve (3) which is delimited by a bending ring (6) on at least one side, a further region (5) which is provided with axial slits (9'), open to the associated end side (4a) of the sleeve (3), and which serves as a clamping region and of which the inner circumference, when the actuating region is not subjected to pressure, is smaller than the circumference of the rod which is to be clamped. Use for rod-clamping devices.

A device for clamping an axially movable bar (1) 
comprising a bar and, surrounding the bar, a sleeve (3, 

3', 3") comprising a region (4) with axially extending 
slots (9, 9', 9") bounded by at least one closed flexural 

ring (6, 6', 6", 6‴, 60) which is framed by an elastic 
shell (12) bearing on its outer periphery and which is 

adapted to be subjected to pressure and which can be 
radially compressed together with the jaws (8, 20) 

remaining between the slots, characterised in that 
adjacent to that side of the flexural ring (6, 6', 6", 

6‴, 60) which is remote from the slotted region (4) there 
is a further region (5) provided with axial slots (9') 

open towards the associated end face of the sleeve and of 
which, when the shell (12) is not subjected to pressure, 

the inner periphery is smaller than the circumference of 
the bar (1). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
slots (9) in the first region (4) are open towards the 

other end face (4a) of the sleeve (3). 
A device according to Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the slots (9, 9') of the first and second regions (4, 5) 

are aligned with one another. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
associated with the slotted region (4) enclosed by the 

shell (12) there is in the region of the open ends of the 
slots (9) an abutment ring (17) the outer periphery of 

which is disposed with clearance in an internally 
encircling recess (16) in the slotted region (4). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that on 
both sides of the first slotted region (4) there are  

 
further regions (5, 5') of smaller inner periphery than 

the circumference of the bar (1) and which are provided 
with slots (9', 9‴) which are open towards the respective 

end. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that a 
flexural ring (19') of the first slotted region (4) is 

provided with an annular flange (21) for axial fixing. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that at least the first slotted region (4, 4") is 

enclosed by a housing (7) which is provided with 
connections (15) for the application of pressure. 
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
end faces of the elastic shell (12) cooperate with 

encircling sealing rings (13) which are disposed in the 
housing (7) and define a sealed annular space (14) for the 

application of pressure. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
further region (5) widens out conically towards the free 

end of the jaws (8") formed between the slots and is 
disposed in a conical opening in the housing (7). 
A device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
angle (α) of the conical widening (18) is between 12 and 

45°. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
length (a, b) of the slots (9, 9', 9") in the first and in 

the further region (4, 4", 5) is different.  
 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
cross-section of the flexural ring (6", 6‴) at right-angles 

to the axis (10) of the sleeve (3) is of a greater 
dimension that in the direction of the axis.
