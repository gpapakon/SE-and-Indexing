<ABSTRACT>
A differential amplifier includes an input 
stage differential amplifier circuit and an output 

stage differential amplifier circuit. Differential 
common-mode output voltages of the output stage 

differential amplifier circuit are converted into 
common-mode currents by transistors having sources 

connected in common. The common-mode currents are 
taken as input mirror currents of a current mirror 

circuit. Output mirror currents of the current 
mirror circuit are supplied to the drain side as 

output electrode of a constant current transistor of 
the input stage differential amplifier circuit to 

form a common-mode feedback circuit. Since the 
common-mode feedback circuit is constructed only by 

the common-mode voltage/current converting 
transistors and the current mirror circuit, the 

feedback paths can be reduced to establish a transfer 
function with a single pole for stability of 

operation of the differential amplifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invent ion relates generally to 
a differential amplifier. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a differential amplifier adapted 
to be integrated in C-MOS monolithic IC. An example of a differential amplifier of C-MOS 
structure having a conventional common-mode 
feedback circuit has been disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 2-44404. The circuit 
disclosed in the foregoing publication will be 
discussed with reference to Fig. 3. Differential inputs 101 and 102 are applied 
to respective gate electrodes of NMOS transistors 1 
and 2 as differential transistors having sources 
connected in common. A constant current NMOS 
transistor 5 is provided for supplying a constant 
current to a common junction of the sources of the 
NMOS transistors 1 and 2. A bias is applied to the 
gate of the NMOS transistor 5. PMOS transistors 3 
and 4 are active loads of the transistors 1 and 2, 
respectively. With these transistors 1 to 5, an input 
stage differential amplifier 200 is formed. A  
 
differential amplifier output of this input stage 
differential amplifier 200 is obtained from 
respective drains of the transistors 1 and 2. The input stage differential amplifier 
output serves as a differential input of an output 
stage differential amplifier 201. The input stage 
differential amplifier output is thus applied to 
respective gate inputs of a pair of PMOS transistors 
6,7 having source connected in common. As active 
loads for a pair of transistors 6 and 7, NMOS 
transistors 8 and 9 are provided. A bias 106 is 
applied to the gates of the transistors 8 and 9. The amplifier outputs 103 and 104 of the 
output stage differential amplifier 201 are output 
through respective drains of the transistors 6 and 7. 
The signal at the differential inputs 101 and 102 is 
amplified to be obtained through the differential 
outputs 103 and 104. Next, discussion will be given for the 
common-mode feedback circuit. PMOS transistors 10, 
11 which take the differential outputs (drain outputs 
of the transistors 1 and 2) as gate inputs and 
convert the differential output voltages into 
current, are provided. The drain outputs of the 
transistors 10 and 11 are connected in common for 
current composition. The composite current 
corresponds to a common mode output voltage of the  
 
input stage differential amplifier. The composite current of a pair of common-mode 
current generating transistors 10 and 11 are an 
input mirror current of a current mirror circuit 202. 
The current mirror circuit 202 comprises
