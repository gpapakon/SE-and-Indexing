<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in the coating of a 
roll (T) of a paper machine, which roll (T) is coated 

with a polymer, preferably with polyurethane. In the 
method, the desired surface property values of the 

roll are fed into the central unit (10) of the system. 
In the method, the roll is coated while following a 

function f₁(x),f₃(x) that has been created in the central 
unit (10) over the distance of the length of the 

roll, whereby a surface hardness or surface profile 
corresponding to the formed function f₁(x),f₂(x) and 

comprising no steps or other points of discontinuity 
can be formed. The invention also concerns a coated 

roll of a paper machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for coating of a roll of a paper machine as defined in the 
preamble of claim 1, 
which is based on the technique disclosed in US-A-5 176 940. In the prior art, a process of coating of a roll with polyurethane by means of rotation 
casting is known. However, in the prior art, for the central unit of the system, a 
satisfactory method is not known in which the coating of a so-called shape-profiled 
and/or hardness-profiled roll should take place smoothly without discontinuity in the 
hardness or in the shape. In the present application, a novel method is suggested, in which, before the polymer 
is cast, at least three desired values of surface hardness/surface profile are fed into 
the central unit of the system as starting-value data over the length of the roll. Said 
desired values of surface hardness/surface profile are preferably chosen at the ends 
of the roll and at the middle of the roll. On the basis of the given starting values, the 
central unit, which is preferably a microprocessor, forms a surface-property function 
f1(x),f3(x), which represents the desired surface hardness/surface profile shape 
across the entire length of the roll. Thus, said function includes the given starting 
value points, for example three starting-value data. According to the invention, a 
mathematical function f1(x),f3(x) is formed, which approximates a set of points of 
longitudinal position/surface hardness of the roll. Preferably, the function f1(x),f3(x) 
is a polynomial function. It can be a function of second, third, or higher degree. The 
function f1(x) is formed in the central unit on the basis of the starting-value data. 
When three starting-value data are used, said set of points can be approximated by 
means of a parabola. The invariables of the parabola passing through the starting-value 
points are obtained when a group of equations is formed out of the points and 
this group is solved numerically, e.g., by means of Cramer's rule.  
 Since the surface-hardness function f1(x) that was formed cannot be used directly for 
controlling the casting machine, further a second function f2(x) is formed, which is 
a so-called mix-ratio set-value function, which determines the set value corresponding 
to the desired hardness at each point of length of the roll, i.e. the mix ratio with 
which the desired hardness is obtained. The profile form of the roll face can be regulated by, in the casting situation, 
regulating the flow quantity of the polymer applied from the casting nozzle
