<ABSTRACT>
A film for receiving a deposited metal layer is 
formed of a resin composition comprising (I) 90.5 - 99.9wt% 

crystalline ethylene polymer having a melting point of 
120 - 130°C and a density of 0.910 - 0.940 g/cm³, and (II) 

0.1 - 9.5wt% of at least one ethylene copolymer having a 
50 - 95wt% ethylene content and selected from ethylene-(meth)acrylate 

copolymer, ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, 
ethylene-unsaturated glycidyl monomer-vinyl acetate 

terpolymer, and ethylene-unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride-(meth)acrylate 
terpolymer. 
The film, which may be laminated, provides excellent 
adhesive strength to the deposited layer and has a good 

appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film and a laminate
film for metal deposition, which films provide excellent
deposition properties, excellent adhesive strength between
a deposited metal layer and the film for metal deposition,
and good appearance both before and after metal deposition.Metal-deposited films obtained by depositing metal
on plastics film are widely used as packaging materials
because of their excellent gas barrier and light-shielding
properties. Such films are commonly formed of polyethylene
terephthalate or polypropylene: polyolefin film has poor
adhesive strength to a deposited metal layer. Many proposals
have been made to improve the adhesion of a polyolefin
film; for example, JP-B-57-14377 (the term "JP-B" as used
herein means an examined Japanese patent publication) and
JP-A-56-72037 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
unexamined published Japanese patent application) disclose
modifying polypropylene with unsaturated carboxylic acids
and blending the modified polypropylene with polypropylene
or a mixture of polypropylene and a large amount of an
inorganic filler; and JP-B-60-51553 discloses improving
the adhesion of polypropylene by gradually cooling it when
forming a film to yield a roughened surface.However, the above expedients are still inadequate.
The polypropylene modified by graft polymerization and 
then blended exhibits insufficient improvement in adhesive
strength to a deposited metal layer; and in the cases of mixing
a large amount of an inorganic filler and making a surface-roughened
film by gradually cooling, a metal-deposited layer
having a good appearance is not obtained.European Patent No. 0 353 068 discloses an overlay film
obtained by forming a substrate layer composed of a resin
composition comprising an ethylene copolymer, such as ethylene-methacrylic
acid ester copolymer, and a crystalline polyolefin
having a melting point of 110°C or higher on at least one side
of a base layer, preferably composed of a crystalline polyolefin,
by any method, such as co-extrusion laminating, followed by
cooling; and European Patent No. 0 492 163 discloses a linear
random N-substituted acrylamide copolymer comprising 65 to 99 %
by mole of ethylene units, 1 to 15 % by mole of acrylate units
and 1 to 35 % by mole of acrylamide units, the copolymer having
a weight average molecular weight of 1000 to 5000, and also
discloses an aqueous composition, a resin film, a laminate,
recording paper and a foamed article comprising the N-substituted
acrylamide copolymer, respectively. In
