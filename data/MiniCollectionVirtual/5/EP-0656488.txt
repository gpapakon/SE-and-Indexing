<ABSTRACT>
Torsional vibration damper for a shaft (2) rotating about an axis (1), comprising a hub part (3) connected to the shaft (2), at least two inertial masses (4), which can be pivoted in the circumferential direction about pivots (9), being held fast on the hub part (3), in each case at least one spring (6) being provided for the static position determination of the inertial masses (4), and the pivots (9) being situated between the inertial masses (4) and the axis (1).

A torsional vibration damper for a shaft (2) which 
rotates about an axis (1), comprising a hub part (3) 

connected to the shaft (2), in which at least two inertia 
masses (4) which can be deflected essentially in the 

circumferential direction are connected to the hub part (3) 
by tension elements in such a way that a change in the 

distance of the inertia masses (4) from the axis (1) is 
brought about when a deflection movement results, it being 

possible in the non-rotating state of the torsional 
vibration damper for each inertia mass (4) to be moved by at 

least one restoring spring into a position in which it is at 
a distance from the axis, and the distance being variable 

with elastic deformation of the restoring springs (6) by 
means of the centrifugal forces acting on the inertia masses 

(4) when the torsional vibration damper is rotating, 
characterized in that the inertia masses (4) and the hub 

part (3) are connected by at least one flexible band (10), 
and in that the band (10) forms the tension elements. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the band (10) cannot be stretched by 

the centrifugal forces. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the band can be stretched elastically 

by the centrifugal forces. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that only one band (10) 

is provided, which is wrapped around all the inertia masses 
(4) radially on the outer side and on the inner side in the 

hub part (3) in the region of axially parallel projections 
(7) fixed thereon. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 4, 
characterized in that each inertia mass (4) is assigned two 

projections (7) of the hub part (3) which are spaced apart 
in the circumferential direction. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the projections (7) have a very small  

 
spacing from one another which is less than the circumferential 

length of the respectively associated inertia mass 
(4), and in that a spreading element (11) which extends in 

the circumferential direction is provided respectively in 
the gap between the inertia masses (4) and the projections 

(7), and in that the two ends of the band projecting from 
each inertia mass (4) in the direction of the mutually 

facing sides of the projections (7) are moved by the 
spreading element into an essentially parallel arrangement 

relative to each other. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that at least those 

surface zones of the inertia masses (4), of the projections 
and/or of the spreading element (11) bringing about a change 

in direction of the band (10) are of rounded configuration 
in the circumferential direction. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the restoring 

springs (6) consist of an elastomeric material. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 8, 
characterized in that the band (10) is at least partially 

embedded in the elastomeric material. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the band is of a 

closed ring-like configuration in the manner of a loop. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the inertia masses 

(4) are connected to the hub part (3) by tension elements 
independent of one another. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that inertia masses (4) 

are provided which, when the torsional vibration damper is 
not rotating, are at different distances from the axis. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any one 
of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that inertia masses (4) 

are provided which have differing sizes relative to one 
another.
