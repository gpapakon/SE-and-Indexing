An insulated conductor pair includes a first insulated 
conductor including a first insulating material over more than 

half of an exterior surface of the first insulated conductor. 
The insulated conductor pair further includes a second 

insulated conductor including a second insulating material 
over more than half of an exterior surface of the second 

insulated conductor. The first and second insulating 
materials are distinguishable from one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conductors and, more
particularly, to insulated conductor pairs according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method for making same.The use of conductors arranged in pairs is well known
from the use of such conductor pairs in telephone circuitry
and other high-frequency applications. Such conductor pairs,
and conductors generally, are used in situations where, for
example, it is necessary to extend large quantities of
conductors between two points. To avoid checking each
conductor of a large number of conductors for conductivity at
each end of a plurality of conductors, various means for
identifying the individual conductors of the plurality of
conductors have been devised. Among the more popular means of
identifying individual conductors is through the use of a
color code system, whereby individual conductors are coated
with differently colored insulating material for purposes of
identification. other techniques for identifying individual
conductors include the printing of markings such as stripes or
words on the insulating material.The great need for conductor pairs in applications such
as those noted above has been a motivating factor in the
development of a highly competitive industry in manufacturing
such conductor pairs, and has led to a variety of techniques
for manufacturing such conductor pairs. According to one
technique, individual conductors are coated with an insulating
material and subsequently bonded together by, for example, an 
adhesive (herein referred to as a "bonded pair"). According
to another technique, individual, substantially parallel
conductors are guided through an extruder apparatus in which
they are both covered with insulating material in a single
coating operation so that they are extruded together in an
attached form or are forced together so that they attach to
one another shortly after being extruded (herein referred to
as an "attached pair"). The individual conductors of
bonded or attached pair are preferably separable by breaking a
web or attachment point between them so that their ends can be
connected to desired connectors.It is particularly useful to be able to identify
conductors as part of a conductor pair. Earlier methods of
identifying conductors as part of a conductor pair included
simply twisting a pair of wires together. More advantageous
methods of identifying conductors as part of a conductor pair
include the above-mentioned techniques for forming bonded
pairs or attached pairs to avoid the likelihood of separation
of
