<ABSTRACT>
The overlap-style shell (1), particularly for sports 
shoes such as ski boots, ice skates, or roller skates, has, 

at least on its outer flap (3), at least one recess (4) that 
connects two separate regions (7,8) of the perimetric edge 

of the flap. The recess is furthermore formed along a 
direction that affects the lateral metatarsal region of the 

foot. It is thus possible to achieve optimum and easy 
opening of the flaps in order to insert the foot and to 

maintain adequate tightness against water or snow at the 
overlapping regions of the flaps (2,3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an overlap-style shell 
particularly for sports shoes such as ski boots, ice skates, 
or roller skates. It is currently known to manufacture shells having two 
mutually overlapping flaps that can be secured by virtue of 
conventional means such as levers. One of the problems observed in the prior art 
essentially resides in the fact that since said shells are 
made of plastics, they have a given degree of rigidity that 
makes it difficult for the user to insert his foot, since he 
must force said flaps apart. Any use of a soft plastics would also entail problems, 
because shell rigidity is required in order to allow good 
transmission of efforts applied by the user and because 
there is a strongly felt need to limit, during sports 
practice, the infiltration of water inside the shell in the 
flap overlap region. Said flaps in fact tend to slide with respect to one 
another during use, forming small openings especially along 
their edges; such openings would become very large if the 
flaps were not very rigid, but this is in contrast with the 
need for easy foot insertion mentioned above. Italian utility model patent no. 162434 discloses a 
shoe, particularly for skiing, which comprises a shell or 
tongue that extends upward from the front part to the 
vicinity of the instep region and an intermediate collar-like 
element which surrounds the median region of the 
sole of the shell; a longitudinal opening is present on said 
shell at said tongue, and there is also a cuff which is  
 
articulated to the intermediate element or to the shell. Even this solution, however, has drawbacks: first of 
all it substantially tends to solve the problem linked to 
the watertightness of the shell which, however, on one hand 
is not of the overlap-style type and on the other hand still 
requires the manufacture of additional parts that must be 
pre-assembled to said shell. Moreover, a longitudinal opening is still formed on the 
intermediate element; said opening is connected to multiple 
transverse notches which increase the possibility of water 
infiltration and in any case considerably weaken the 
structure. In any case, in order to achieve adequately easy foot 
insertion it is still necessary to allow the longitudinal 
opening formed on the intermediate element to open out and 
thus act on the securing systems and in any case force a 
deformation of the ends of the intermediate element which 
form the longitudinal opening by forcing the tongue forward. All this ultimately leads to
