<ABSTRACT>
A high-reliability integrated circuit structure, for power 
devices implemented in MOS technology, being of a type 

which comprises a plurality of basic cells (5), each having 
at least one MOS transistor (2) provided with respective 

gate (G), source (S), and drain (D) terminals, has all the 
respective source terminals (S) of the plural cells (5) 

connected together, and all the respective drain terminals 
(D) likewise interconnected. On the other hand, the 

respective gate terminals (G) are provided structurally 
independent and independently addressable. This enables the 

structure to operate correctly even with one or more of the 
basic cells at failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated circuit 
incorporating power devices implemented in MOS technology. In particular, the invention concerns a high-reliability 
circuit structure, for power devices implemented in MOS 
technology, being of a type which comprises a plurality of 
basic cells, each having at least one MOS transistor with 
its associated gate, source and drain terminals. As is well known, power devices implemented in MOS or CMOS 
technology are obtained by conneccting in parallel a very 
large number of basic cells, each including at least one 
MOS transistor. Failure or malfunctioning may be expected of such devices, 
for example, due to a short between the gate and source 
terminals of a transistor of any one cell. On the occurrence of a faulty state of this kind, as may be 
brought about by no more than one cell, the whole device 
ceases to operate. The seriousness of such a failure is quite obvious, 
especially where the power devices are incorporated to 
integrated circuits. In cases such as this, a malfunction 
in the power circuit may easily impair the functionality 
and effectiveness of the whole integrated circuit. Additionally, it is found that with integrated circuits 
employing power devices of the MOS type, the aforesaid 
faults may escape troubleshooting procedures carried out 
using diagnostic circuitry.  The technical problem underlying this invention is to 
provide a novel circuit structure for MOS power devices, 
which has such structural and functional features as to 
overcome the aforementioned drawbacks affecting the state 
of the art and allow proper operation of the integrated 
circuit even on the occurrence of a faulty condition. The solutive idea on which the invention stands is to 
provide a redundant circuit structure which would let the 
whole device operate correctly even in the event of a short 
occurring in a basic cell thereof, while also issuing a 
fault warning. Based on this solutive idea, the technical problem is 
solved by a circuit structure as previously indicated and 
as defined in the characterizing portion of Claim 1. The features and advantages of a circuit structure 
according to the invention will become apparent from the 
following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, 
given by way of example and not of limitation with 
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings: 
Figure 1 shows in diagram form a power circuit structure 
according to the prior art; Figure 2 shows in diagram form the structure of Figure 1
