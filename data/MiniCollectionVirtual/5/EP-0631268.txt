Method for the early detection and indication of errors and dangers for a regional 
public transport system which comprises railborne or trackless vehicles having 

receiving-transmitting units (9a, 9) and stationary receiving-transmitting units (18) 
which are connected to a stationary central computer (19) of a vehicle control 

centre, characterised in that each vehicle (1, 26 and 26a) is provided on the devices 
(4, 6-8), which are connected to the possible sources of danger and error for 

passenger and vehicle, with sensors for the purpose of detecting data from door 
closing devices, the development of temperatures, gas and smoke and changes in 

current, voltage, pressure and rotational speed, this data is fed to a vehicle 
computer (5) of the vehicle (1, 26, 26a) and collected and in the event of danger 

transmitted as an emergency call over relatively short distances up to approximately 
300 m with a vehicle and specific data identification by virtue of an ultra-sound or 

infrared transmitting device or by virtue of a license exempted radio device of the 
vehicle (1, 26, 26a) as a receiving-transmitting unit (9) not only to the driver's cab 

of the vehicle (1, 26, 26a) but also to all of the receiving-transmitting units (9a, 18) 
which at the time of the data transmission are located within the working range of 

the receiving-transmitting unit (9) which is transmitting the emergency call, wherein 
the emergency call is repeatedly relayed in an accumulative system by receiving 

vehicles (1, 26a) for a period of time until it reaches a stationary receiving-transmitting 
unit (18) and is relayed from said receiving-transmitting unit (18) to the 

central computer (19) and stored therein. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that all of the data is subjected to 
a desired-actual-value comparison by the vehicle computer (5) in either a permanent 

manner with respect to time or in relatively short, continuous time intervals and, in 
the event that a tolerance limit is exceeded, data which is determined by way of the 

receiving-transmitting unit (9) is transmitted as an emergency call with the vehicle 
identification to the driver's cab of the relevant vehicle (1, 26) and by way of the 

receiving-transmitting unit (9, 9a) to the driver's cab of a vehicle (9a, 26a) of the 
same type, which is located in the vicinity or approaching during the journey, and to  

 
the stationary receiving-transmitting units (18) located in the vicinity, and transmitted 

to the passenger areas in an acoustic or optical manner. 
Method according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in that the fixedly installed 
central computer (19) transmits the data of the emergency call with the relevant 

vehicle identification to decentralised computers (23, 24, 25) of a workshop, an 
operational management department, operational management centre or to 

computers of further service centres with which said central computer (19) is linked. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a return 
call as a confirmation is transmitted using the same accumulative process to the 

vehicle (1, 26) which transmits the emergency call. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that after the 
data has been successfully transmitted to the central computer (19) and after said 

data has been stored and after a successful return call to the vehicle (1, 26) which 
is transmitting the emergency call, this data in the mobile or stationary receiving-transmitting 

units (9a, 18) is erased by the central computer (19). 
Method for the early detection and indication of errors and dangers for a 
regional public transport system which comprises railborne or trackless vehicles 

having receiving-transmitting units (9a, 9) and stationary receiving-transmitting units 
(18) which are connected to a stationary central computer (19) of a vehicle control 

centre, for the purpose of carrying out the method according to the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the device consists of temperature sensors, gas and smoke 

development sensors, current, voltage, pressure testing and rotational speed 
measuring devices and microprocessors (4, 6-8) whose ascertained data can be 

passed either by way of a cable within the vehicle (1, 26, 26a) or without cable by 
way of an ultra-sound or infrared transmission device or by way of a license 

exempted radio device as a receiving-transmitting unit to a vehicle computer (5) 
located in the vehicle (1, 26, 26a) and in the event of danger is transmitted by said 

vehicle computer as an emergency call over relatively short distances up to  
 

approximately 300 m with a vehicle and specific data identification by virtue of 
separate ultra-sound or infrared transmitting device or by virtue of a license 

exempted radio device of the vehicle (1, 26, 26a) as a receiving-transmitting unit (9) 
to all receiving-transmitting units (9a, 18) which at the time of the data transmission 

are located within the working range of the receiving-transmitting unit (9) which is 
transmitting the emergency call, wherein the data of the emergency call is 

repeatedly relayed in an accumulative process by the receiving vehicles (1, 26a) for 
a period of time until said data reaches a fixedly installed receiving-transmitting unit 

(18) which is provided with a modem (20) and an amplifying device (21) from which 
said receiving-transmitting unit (18) the data of the emergency call is transmitted 

to the central computer (19) and stored therein, the said central computer being 
connected to several computers (23-25) in a network (22) linked thereto. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the vehicle computer (5) for the 
purpose of transmitting the data of the emergency calls is connected by cable or 

without cable to optical warning lamps and/or warning boards and to loud speakers 
for the purpose of providing an acoustic warning both to the passenger
 areas and 
to the driver's cab. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the vehicle computer (5) is also 
receivably connected by cable or without cable to the sensors of a connected 

vehicle (1, 26, 26a). 
Device according to any one of the claims 6 to 8, characterised in that data, 
messages and switching functions can be transmitted selectively from the central 

computer (19) by way of the receiving-transmitting units (9, 9a, 18) either to a 
particular vehicle (1, 26, 26a) or to several vehicles (1, 26, 26a) with a vehicle and 

specific data identification. 
Device according to any one of the claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the data 
from the auxiliary computers already provided in the vehicle can be converted to a 

uniform data structure by the vehicle computer (5) to suit the data of the intelligent  
 

vehicle computer (5) and said data can be evaluated either directly by said vehicle 
computer (5) and/or by the central computer (19). 
Device according to any one of the claims 6 to 10, characterised in that the 
stationary receiving-transmitting unit (9) is directly connected to the central computer
