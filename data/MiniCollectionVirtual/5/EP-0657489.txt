<ABSTRACT>
The free-flowing, porous support material is prepared from at least one thermoplastic base polymer containing additives introduced into the porous structure. First, suitable foaming aids are added to the base polymers, the mixture is melted and mixed before and/or after melting. The mixture is then preferably extruded and cooled to form a free-flowing, porous support material. At least one additive is added to the porous support material and mixed therewith at a temperature (TM) below the melting point of the base polymers, but above the melting point of the additive. The porous support material preferably has ellipsoidal pores which are converted into their elongate form during extrusion.

A process for the production of a pourable, porous carrier material of

at least one thermoplastic base polymer with additives introduced into the
porous structure, characterized in that


a) suitable foaming aids are added to the base polymer, the whole is
melted, mixed before and/or after melting and the resulting mixture is

cooled to form a pourable, porous carrier material with ellipsoidal
pores and
b) at least one additive is added to and mixed with the porous carrier
material at a temperature (T
M
) below the melting point of the base
polymer, but above the melting point of the additive,

with the proviso that step a) is carried out in an extruder or multiple-screw
kneader/extruder and that an inert gas is introduced at least periodically

into the melt of base polymer and foaming aid in step a).
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the base
polymer is selected from


a homopolymer of an α-olefin containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms or a
copolymer of two corresponding α-olefins, including homopolymers of

low density (LDPE), linear low density (LLDPE), very low density
(VLDPE), ultra low density (ULDPE) and high density (HDPE),

propylene, including homopolymers, 1-butylene, 1-pentylene, 1-hexylene,
1-octylene, isobutylene, 2-methyl-1-butylene, 3-methyl-1-pentylene,

4-methyl-1-pentylene, 2,3-dimethyl-1-butylene, 2-ethyl-1-butylene
and mixtures thereof or
a copolymer of ethylene with 1-butylene, 1-hexylene, 1-octylene or 4-methyl-1-pentylene
or
an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene/ethyl acetate
copolymer, an ethylene/acrylic acid copolymer and mixtures thereof

or with copolymers of ethylene and 1-butylene, 1-hexylene, 1-octylene
or 4-methyl-1-pentylene, or
ethylene/propylene rubber (EPDM), including diene-modified types 
(EPR), a styrene/butadiene/styrene copolymer

(SBS), a styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene copolymer (SEBS) and
mixtures thereof.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
foaming acids are selected from the group of azodicarbonamides and citric

acid derivatives.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the liquid and/or low-melting additives charged to a degree of 5 to 80% by

weight are mixed in at a temperature (T
M
) of 30 to 140°C.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
antistatic agents, antifogging agents, coupling agents, calendering aids,

mould release agents, lubricants, plasticizers, fragrances and/or
flameproofing agents are mixed in as additives.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that at
least one of the components fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid esters,

nitrogen-containing fatty derivatives, fatty acid amides, wax acids, wax acid
esters, paraffins, neutral waxes, metal soaps; acid esters of fatty alcohols,

polyol esters, fatty alcohol/fatty acid esters, fatty acid esters of glycerol,
neutral polyol esters of fatty acids, fatty alcohol/dicarboxylic acid esters,

fatty alcohol/fatty acid esters, stearic acid, oligomeric fatty acid esters, fatty
acid monoamides, fatty acid diamides; neutral ester waxes, polar

polyethylene waxes, nonpolar polyethylene waxes; nitrogen-free nonionic
compounds, polyethylene glycol esters, polyethylene glycol ethers,

monoglycerides, diglycerides, ethoxylated fatty amines; anionic
compounds, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl phosphates; cationic

compounds and quaternary ammonium compounds is used as an additive.
The use of the charged porous material produced by the process
claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 for introducing additives into mass-produced

plastics, more particularly in the manufacture of film and in moulding or
injection moulding.
