<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an extrusion die (2) for 
producing ceramic honeycomb materials. It is particularly 

useful in producing such extrudates in sheet form (E) by 
configuring the die (2) in the form of a cylinder and 

providing a cutting device (6) proximate to the exterior of 
th
e cylinder (4) so that when relative rotation is imparted 
between the cutter (6) and the cylinder, a honeycomb sheet (E) is 

removed. A cover can be provided over the exterior 
surface of the cylindrically-shaped die to permit 

formation of honeycomb extrudates in pellet form.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to extruding ceramic 
honeycomb structures. Ceramic honeycomb structural bodies are effective as 
catalyst carriers for purifying exhaust gases of internal 
combustion engines and as filters for fine particle 
removal. These honeycomb structural bodies are usually 
made of a ceramic material such as cordierite, alumina, 
silicon carbide, and the like, and owing to their 
configurations, they are generally produced by an 
extrusion method. In order for honeycomb structures to function 
efficiently as catalytic converters, it is necessary that 
their cells provide a substantially large surface area for 
catalytic material to react with the exhaust gases. Also, 
the cell walls must have a substantially thin 
cross-sectional dimension to provide a large open frontal 
area to reduce back pressure within the exhaust system. 
However, the thin walled structure must have sufficient 
mechanical and thermal integrity to withstand normal 
automotive impact and thermal requirements. In the past, it has been customary to form extrusion 
dies for forming thin-walled honeycomb structures from a 
solid die body by saw-cutting discharge passages in the 
outlet face of the die body and drilling rather lengthy  
 
feed holes into the inlet face of the die body which 
communicate with such discharge passages, as shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,790,654 to Bagley. As further shown in the 
Bagley patent, the feed holes may communicate with each 
intersecting passage or every other intersection, as 
desired. However, in both cases the feed holes extend a 
substantial distance through a unitary die body. In order for the extruded material to coalesce within 
the discharge passages, it is necessary for the passages 
to have sufficient length so that the extruded material 
will have time to flow transversely within slots to knit 
into a unitary grid prior to being longitudinally 
discharged from the outlet face of the die. 
Alternatively, additional feed holes may be provided in 
communication with the slot gridwork to reduce the amount 
of transverse flow required to provide such a unitary 
cellular matrix prior to discharge from the die face. In the past, planar extrusion dies have been utilized 
to form ceramic honeycomb structures. Examples of such 
extrusion systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,836,302 to Kaukeinen, 4,118,456 to Blanding, et 
al., 4,687,433 to Ozachi, et al., and 4,877,766 to Frost. 
Such devices work well in extruding single piece 
structures having relatively small

A method of forming honeycomb structures in sheet 
form comprisin
g: 

providing an extrusion system comprising: 

an extrusion die (2) with a continuous outer surface (4) 
in at least two dimensions and having intersecting 

passages configured to discharge material extruded from 
said extrusion die in a honeycomb configuration and 
cutting means (6) positionable proximate to the 
outer surface of said extrusion die to cut material 

extruded through the intersecting passages; 
advancing formable material to said extrusion 
die, through the intersection passages, and outwardly from 

the outer surface to form a honeycomb extrudate; and 
imparting relative rotation between said 
extrusion die and said cutting means, whereby said cutting 

means removes the honeycomb extrudate from the outer 
surface of said extrusion die as an elongate sheet. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the 
continuous outer surface has a longitudinally-extending, 

cylindrical configuration, said cutting means extends 
substantially parallel to the longitudinal extent of the 

outer surface, and the intersecting passages include a 
first set of discharge passages extending 

circumferentially around said extrusion die with each of 
said first set of discharge passages being longitudinally 

spaced along the length of the extrusion die and a second 
set of discharge passages extending across the length of 

the extrusion die with each of the second set of discharge 
passages being spaced around its circumference. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the 
formable material can be sintered to form a ceramic.  

 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
said imparting relative rotation is achieved by 

maintaining said cutting means substantially stationary 
and rotating said extrusion die, or by maintaining said 

extrusion die substantially stationary and rotating said 
cutting means. 
An apparatus for forming honeycomb structures in sheet form 
according to the method of the claims 1 to 4, comprising: 


an extrusion die (2) with a continuous outer surface (4) 
in at least two dimensions and having intersecting 

discharge passages (18); 
conveying means (12, 14) to advance a formable material 
into said extrusion die, through the discharge passages, 

and radially away from the outer surface to form a 
honeycomb extrudate; 
cutting means (6) positionable proximate to the 
outer surface of said extrusion die to cut material 

extruded through the discharge passages, at the outer 
surface of said extrusion die, as a honeycomb extrude; and 
means to impart relative rotation between said 
extrusion die and said cutting means, whereby said cutting 

means, when positioned proximate to the outer surface, 
removes the honeycomb extrudate from the outer surface of 

said extrusion die as an elongate sheet.

continuous outer surface has a cylindrical configuration, 

and the intersecting passages include a first set of 
discharge slots extending circumferentially around said 

extrusion die with each of said first set of discharge 
slots being longitudinally spaced along the length of said
