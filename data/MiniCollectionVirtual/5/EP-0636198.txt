<ABSTRACT>
A flush mechanism for use with a toilet tank (10) is disclosed. The mechanism permits selection between flushing cycles of two different time durations. The tank has a wall (16) with an outlet (14) therein and a valve member (17). The flush mechanism has a shaft (32) linked at one end to the valve, a float (54) slidably mounted on the shaft, and a cam (40) pivotally connected to the shaft (32) adjacent the float (54). The cam (40) is rotatable between a short flush position wherein the float (54) is allowed to assume a high position along the shaft (32) and a long flush position wherein the cam member (40) forces the float (54) into a low position along the shaft (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flush mechanism
that allows a user to choose between selected flush
volumes.Due to increasing population and limited water
supply, conservation of water is becoming important. A
significant source of water consumption is the water used
in flushing toilets. The art has recognized that in some
cases a full volume flush is not required to clean out a
toilet bowl (e.g. urine and small amounts of paper only).
Thus, many toilets that are designed to remove heavy
amounts of feces and paper will waste water when faced
with much lighter loads. See US-A-3,908,203, 4,160,294,
4,183,107, 4,328,596, 5,103,507 and 5,153,948.The art has therefore developed toilets that use
less water during certain flush cycles. However, such
devices often require complex and/or expensive
mechanisms, and/or are hard to operate due to poor
leverage characteristics of the actuating mechanism. See
US-A-2,754,521 and 4,411,029. In addition, some such
devices require continued attention by the user after an
initial activation to effect different flushing volumes
or an additional deactivation control to terminate a long
flushing cycle prematurely.Also, some such devices include parts which are
arranged in manner wherein lateral forces are exerted on
cooperating parts in a manner to cause poor seating of
the valve for stopping the flow of water at the 
termination of a flushing cycle. A further problem has
been component wear between adjacent moving parts, which
results in operation and requires periodic mandatory
readjustment of the relative positions of the cooperating
parts of the device. Thus, a need exists for an
improved, low cost, and reliable mechanism for creating a
dual flush toilet.The present invention provides a flush mechanism for
use to permit selection between two different toilet tank
flush cycles, the tank being of the type having a wall
with an outlet therein and a valve member for opening and
closing the outlet, the flush mechanism comprising a
shaft linked to an outlet valve; a float slidably mounted
on the shaft; a first activation means connected to a
first flush linkage, and a second activation means
connected to a second linkage, characterized by a cam
pivotally connected to the shaft adjacent the float, the
cam being rotatable between a short flush position
wherein the cam allows the float to assume a high
position along the shaft, and a long flush position
wherein the cam member forces the float into a lower
position along the shaft; the first linkage being
connected to the cam at

<CLAIMS>
A flush mechanism for use to permit selection
between two different toilet tank flush cycles, the tank

(10) being of the type having a wall (16) with an outlet
(14) therein and a valve member (19) for opening and

closing the outlet, the flush mechanism comprising a
shaft (32) linked to an outlet valve (19); a float (54)

slidably mounted on the shaft (32); a first activation
means (25,27) connected to a first flush linkage (60),

and a second activation means (24,28) connected to a
second linkage (61), characterized by a cam (40)

pivotally connected to the shaft (32) adjacent the float
(54), the cam (40) being rotatable between a short flush

position wherein the cam allows the float (54) to assume
a high position along the shaft (32), and a long flush

position wherein the cam member forces the float (54)
into a lower position along the shaft (32); the first

linkage (60) being connected to the cam (40) at a first
location; the second flush linkage (61) being connected

to the cam (40) at a second location; the first
activation means being capable of moving the first flush

linkage (60), thereby allowing the cam to assume a short
flush position; and the second activation means being

capable of moving the second linkage thereby moving the
cam into a long flush position.
The flush mechanism as recited in claim 1,
further including a float stop (59) disposed below the

float (54) on the shaft (32) to limit the downward
longitudinal movement of the float (54).
The flush mechanism as recited in claim 1,
further including a cam projection (48) positioned on the 

cam (40) so as to contact the shaft member (32) upon a
long flush activation and thereby limit further rotation

of the cam (40).
The flush mechanism of claim 1, wherein a short
flush activation of the cam (40) will, if the last flush

was a short flush, cause the cam to rotate in one
direction and then automatically rock back in the

opposite direction.
