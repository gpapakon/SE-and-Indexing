<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic carrier
, and a two component-type
developer containing the carrier and a toner for
developing electrostatic images.Hitherto, various electrophotographic
processes have been disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.
2,297,691; 3,666,363; 4,071,361; etc. In these
processes, an electrostatic latent image is formed on
a photoconductive layer by irradiating a light image
corresponding to an original, and a toner having a
polarity of charge opposite to that of the latent
image is attached onto the latent image to develop the
latent image. Subsequently, the resultant toner image
is, after being transferred onto a transfer material
such as paper, as desired, fixed , e.g., by heating,
pressing, or heating and pressing, or with solvent
vapor to obtain a copy.In the step of developing the latent image,
toner particles charged to a polarity opposite to that
of the latent image is attracted by electrostatic
force to be caused to attach onto the latent image.
Alternatively, in case of reversal development, toner
particles having a triboelectric charge of the same 
polarity as that of the latent image is used. In
general, methods for developing an electrostatic
latent image with a toner can be classified into a
developing method using a two component-type developer
constituted by mixing a small amount of a toner with
carrier and a developing method using a monocomponent-type
developer constituted by a toner alone without
containing a carrier.The carrier constituting the two component-type
developer may generally be classified roughly
into an electroconductive carrier and an insulating
carrier.The electroconductive carrier may generally
comprise oxidized or yet-unoxidized iron powder. The
two component-type developer comprising iron powder
carrier is accompanied with problems that the
triboelectric chargeability of the toner is liable to
be unstable and the resultant visible image formed by
the developer is liable to be accompanied with fog.
Further, along with continual use of the developer,
toner particles adhere onto the surface of the iron
powder carrier particles to increase the electrical
resistivity of the carrier particles, so that the bias
current decreases and the triboelectric charge is
instabilized. As a result, the resultant toner image
is liable to have a lower image density and be
accompanied with increased fog. The insulating carrier representatively
comprises a core material of a ferromagnetic material,
such as iron, nickel or ferrite, uniformly coated
