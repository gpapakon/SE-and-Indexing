<CLAIMS>
An insulated container for storing liquid 
helium, with a draw-off-siphon for drawing off the 

liquide wherein the draw-off siphon (3, 4) consists 
of two parts (3 and 4), and whereat at least on part 

(3) is fixedly integrated into the container (1) and 
thermally uncoupled relative to the environment. 
The insulated container as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the two parts (3, 4) are movable relative to 

one another. 
The insulated container as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, wherein the first part (3) extends from 

the bottom (5) of the container to the bottom end of the 
neck tube (6) and has a connection part (7) by means of 

which it can be coupled to a counterpart (9) which is 
provided on the second part (4) and which extends to the 

outside via the draw-off opening (10). 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein the first part (3) is fixed to the 

bottom (5) and to the neck tube (6). 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the connection (7, 9) of the two 

parts (3, 4) consists of a cold-sealing plug-in connection. 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 5, wherein the connection part (7) has means 

facilitating insertion, preferably a conical insertion 
opening (8). 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 6, wherein the second part (4) can be positioned 

by means of a displacement device (10) in a 
position thermally separated from the first part (3). 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 7, wherein the displacement device (10) 

consists of a threaded bolt (11) which is arranged on the 
container and guides the second part (4), and the second 

part (4) carries a cap nut (13) which is adjustable on  
 

the threaded bolt (11). 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 8, wherein the threaded bolt (11) has a 

central bore (12) in which the second part (4) is guided. 
The insulated container as claimed in one of 
claims 1 to 9, wherein at least one radial seal (14) is 

arranged between the central bore (12) and the second 
part (4).
