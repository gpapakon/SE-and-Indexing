<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
elements containing an azopyrazolone masking coupler
used to correct for unwanted absorption in color
negative film and, in the same layer, a ballasted
aromatic nitro compound having a reduction peak
potential more positive than -1.3 V vs. the Standard
Calomel Electrode (S.C.E.)The use of 4-phenylazopyrazolone masking
couplers is known in the art. See ,for example, U.S.
2,428,034; U.S. 2,434,272; U.S. 2,455,170; U.S.
2,688,539; U.S. 2,704,711; U.S. 2,808,329; U.S.
3,476,560; U.S. 3,796,574; U.S. 4,427,763; U.S.
4,777,123, and EP 213,490; as well as those identified
in Research Disclosure December 1989, Section VII, Part
G, Publiched by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd.,
Dudley Annex, 12A North Street, Emworth, Hampshire PO10
7DQ, England. These compounds have proven useful since
they are yellow colored in nonexposed areas and magenta
colored in exposed areas. Thus, when in reality the
magenta dye formed in a color negative photographic
process has a small but significant unwanted absorption
in the blue range, this may be balanced somewhat by the
relative loss of blue absorption due to conversion of
the mask color from yellow to magenta in the exposed
areas. Then, an adjustment can be made to the spectral
content of the light used to produce the positive from
the negative to effectively cancel out the unwanted
blue absorption which is now relatively constant across
both the exposed and unexposed areas of the negative.While phenylazopyrazolone masking couplers
have been employed as a means of offsetting the 
unwanted blue absorption of conventional magenta
couplers, this means for improving the color rendition
has now been found to be responsible for increased
fogging of the photographic element during processing.
This is thought to be due to the formation of a
phenyldinitrogen species from the masking coupler
during development and/or the presence of undesired
reducing agents. This in turn causes the unwanted
nonimagewise development of the photographic silver
halide contained in the photographic element.European Patent Application 232,101 discloses
a photographic element containing a pyrazolotriazole
coupler together with at least 17 mole % of a colored
masking coupler that may be of the azopyrazolone type.
The presence of the large relative percentage of the
masking coupler is said to improve sharpness and grain.
There is no suggestion of the advantages to be obtained
by including a ballasted aromatic nitro compound and,
in fact, the higher concentration of masking
