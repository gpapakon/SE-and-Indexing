<ABSTRACT>
Disposable arrangemet of reaction vessels of identical shape and dimensions for carrying out temperature cycling of a liquid mixture contained in the reaction vessels, each reaction vessel having a first, conical wall region and a second, cylindrical wall region, which cylindrical wall region forms the opening of the reaction vessel at one end, the wall thickness of the first wall region being less than the wall thickness of the second wall region, and the opening of the reaction vessel being able to reeive a closure which is suitable for closing the reaction vessel gas-tightly when it is placed on the opening of the reaction vessel. To facilitate handling and access to the liquids contained in the reaction vessels, the arrangement of reaction vessels is characterised in that it is annular, and in that the closure (87) of each of the reaction vessels (21) can be pierced by a pipetting needle (32).

<CLAIMS>
A throwaway arrangement of reaction containers (21) of the same
shape and dimensions for the performance of temperature cycles in a liquid

mixture in the reaction containers, each reaction container having a first
conical wall region (82) and a second cylindrical wall region (81) which at

one end forms the opening (86) of the reaction container, the thickness of the
first wall region being less than the thickness of the second wall region, and

the opening of the reaction container being adapted to receive a closure (87)
for closing the reaction container in a gas-tight manner when placed on the

opening of the reaction container,

which arrangement of reaction containers is characterized in that it is made
up of the following parts:


a first part (92, 112) made in one piece from a plastic and comprising
an arrangement of reaction containers (21), the arrangement forming a ring

or a segment of a ring and adjacent reaction containers (21) being joined by a
flexible web (94, 114) and
a second part (95, 115) comprising an arrangement of closures (87)
made in one piece from the same plastic, the arrangement forming a ring or

a segment of a ring and adjacent closures (87) in the arrangement of
closures being joined by at least one flexible web (96, 116) and each closure

(87) being pierceable by a pipetting needle and being adapted to close one of
the reaction containers (21) in a gas-tight manner when placed on the

opening (86) thereof.
An arrangement of reaction containers according to claim 1,
characterized in that the arrangement of closures (87) has an extension (25,

101, 111) which can be used as a reference member for the unambiguous
positioning and/or for the automatic detection of the arrangement of reaction

containers (21) in a device for the performance of temperature cycles.
