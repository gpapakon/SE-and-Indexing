<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the selective recovery of solvents from solvent gas mixtures, according to which the solvent gas mixture is sorbed, individual solvent gas fractions are fractionally desorbed from the sorbant, condensed at times offset from each other and connected separately. The apparatus for carrying out the above process includes a sorption unit (1), a cooling apparatus (2) for the condensation, a condenser (3), a measuring apparatus for the composition and/or rate of the desorption gas (8) and/or of the solvent condensate (7), a switchover and distributor apparatus (5) for the solvent condensate and collection vessel (6) for the individual condensed solvent fractions.

Process for the selective recovery of solvents from 
solvent gas mixtures, comprising the steps of sorbing the 

solvent gas mixture in a sorption agent, desorbing the 
solvent gas mixture from the sorption agent, and condensing 

and collecting the solvent gas mixture liquefied after the 
condensation, 
characterized in that
 individual solvent gas 
fractions are desorbed in a fractionated manner from the 

sorption agent, these desorbed solvent gas fractions being 
condensed staggered-in-time and collected separately from one 

another. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the step of sorbing represents an adsorption or absorption of 

the solvent gas mixture. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the solvent gas mixture is sorbed at a pressure of 1 bar 
to 10 bar and a temperature of -20°C to 80°C. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the solvent gas mixture is 
moved together with a carrier gas through the sorption agent. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the individual solvent gas 
fractions are desorbed in a fractionated manner out of the 

sorption agent at a constant pressure and a constant 
temperature. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the individual solvent  
 

gas fractions are desorbed in a fractionated manner out of 
the sorption agent, the pressure being stepwise reduced 

and/or the temperature being stepwise increased. 
Process according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 
the desorption pressure decreases and/or the desorption 

temperature increases when the solvent gas mass flow out of 
the sorption agent falls below a certain level. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the individual solvent gas 
fractions are desorbed in a fractionated manner out of the 

sorption agent at a pressure in the range of 1 bar to 10 bar 
and a temperature in the range of 35°C to 200°C. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the individual solvent gas 
fractions are desorbed in a fractionated manner out of the 

sorption agent by means of a carrier gas. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the solvent gas fraction 
desorbed at a certain pressure and a certain temperature from 

the sorption agent is again selectively sorbed with an 
intermediate sorption agent and subsequently desorbed in a 

fractionated manner staggered-in-time, and the individual 
fractions are condensed and collected separately from one 

another. 
Process according to claim 10, 
charaterized in that
 
the solvent gas fraction desorbed from the sorption agent is 

sorbed in the intermediate sorption agent at a lower 
temperature and/or higher pressure in comparison to the 

desorption from the sorption agent.  
 
Process according to claim 10 or 11, 
characterized 
in that
 the solvent gas fraction is desorbed from the 
intermediate sorption agent at a pressure and a temperature 

which correspond to the pressure and the temperature of the 
desorption from the sorption agent. 
Process according to one or more of the claims 10 to 
12, 
characterized in that
 the unsorbed gas emitting from the 
intermediate sorption agent is adjusted to the pressure and 

the temperature corresponding to the previous desorption from 
the sorption agent and led back to the sorption agent. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the individual desorbed solvent 
gas fractions are dried by using a drying agent before the 

condensation. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,
