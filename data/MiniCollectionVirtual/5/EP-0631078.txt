<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to a mixer valve with 
electronic control, which incorporates a group of 

valves (27) situated in a housing (26) provided in the 
valve body, placed axially to the coupling (22) 

defining the water outlet duct towards the supply 
mouth. The group of valves is made up of a diaphragm 

valve (30) made of elastic material, essentially in the 
shape of a small bowl placed flush with a valve seat 

(32) inside the outlet duct (21), and of a stop valve 
(31) controlled by an electromagnet (29). The diaphragm 

valve (30) delimits an internal chamber (35) which 
communicates on one hand (A) with a mixed water supply 

duct (24) and on the other (B) with an outlet port (C) 
which extends into the water outlet duct (21) and is 

opened and closed by the stop valve. The diaphragm 
valve (30) is designed to expand and contract radially 

according to the differences in pressure inside and 
outside said chamber following the opening/closing of 

the input port by means of the stop valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to hot and cold water mixer valves for 
hygiene and sanitation units, and more specifically, it concerns improvements 
made to mixer valves with electronic control, especially to a group of valves 
which, when actuated by an electromagnet, control the opening/closing of the 
outlet passage of the water towards the mouth of the valve. Such valves 
according to the preamble of claim 1 are known from EP-A-496 105.  
 Valve components in the form of a disc or washer, whose arrangement 
in the valve body and whose actuation by an electromagnet are always 
problematic, are usually used in the prior-art mixer valves with electronic 
control. In fact, the adoption of valve means of the type used here involves 
considerable obstacles and significant problems both due to the complexity of 
the channels to be made in the valve body and due to the dimensions that the 
valve components must have in order to be able to ensure the desired water 
flows. The presence of these valve components also frequently places 
conditions on the shapes and the sizes of the electronic valves; in fact, in order 
not to go beyond certain limits imposed by the requirements of installation 
and/or aesthetics, recourse is often made to the arrangement of the electronic 
control component at a distance from the valve with the need, therefore, for 
connecting wires. On the other hand, the present invention is focused on finding a 
solution for the drawbacks and on solving the problems of the current 
electronic valves by means of a new, original diaphragm valve structure, an 
arrangement of this valve in a more convenient and easy position on the inside 
of the valve body as well as a housing of the electronic control component 
directly in the valve body, including power supply batteries. The improved electronic valve here proposed 
is in accordance with claim 1.  
 Advantageously, the diaphragm valve has the configuration of a small 
bowl and is able to expand and to contract radially as a function of the 
differences in the pressures on the inside and on the outside of the diaphragm 
valve. In other words, the diaphragm valve exercises its opening/closing 
function of a valve seat with radial action with one of its intermediate 
peripheral zones, which makes it possible to establish, when opened, a passage 
of water with a rim having a large cross section in order to fully meet the flow 
requirements of the valve as well, keeping the dimensions of the valve 
relatively reduced. Also advantageously, the

inlet ducts, a mixed water supply duct (24)

means (25), a water outlet duct (21) communicating with 
the mixed water supply duct (24) on one hand and a 

supply mouth (20') on the other, said outlet duct (21) 
being defined by a coupling (22) and the supply mouth

axially to the coupling (22) defining the water outlet 
duct (21), in that said group of valves is made up of a 

diaphragm valve (30) made of elastic material, such as 
rubber, essentially in the shape of a small bowl 

protruding axially into the coupling (22) and placed 
flush with a valve seat (32) formed in the coupling (22), and 

of a stop valve controlled by said electromagnet (29), 
in that said diaphragm valve (30) delimits an internal 

chamber (35) which communicates on one hand (A) with 
the mixed water supply duct (24) and on the other (B)

outlet duct (21) to the supply mouth through an input 
port (d) which is opened and closed by the stop valve
