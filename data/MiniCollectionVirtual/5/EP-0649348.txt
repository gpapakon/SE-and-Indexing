<ABSTRACT>
A slot die for producing a fibrous web of adhesive material includes a segmented shim having a plurality of fingers in said slot dividing adhesive material into a plurality of adhesive streams. The fingers have tapered ends which are flush with or extend slightly beyond the slot nozzle outlet. Separate material streams emanate from the slot nozzle outlet where they merge and are engaged by air flow producing a fibrous web of adhesive material. The adhesive and air flow are started and stopped at intervals to produce discrete fibrous webs having square, sharp leading and trailing edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the application of 
fibrous coatings to substrates and more particularly to 
the application to substrates of discrete, uniform 
fibrous adhesive coatings having sharp, square cut-on 
and cut-off edges. Many industrial manufacturing processes 
require the application of fibrous adhesive coatings to 
substrates. For example, in the application of non-woven 
absorbent pads to impervious plastic web 
substrates, an application of fibrous adhesive is used 
to bond the two substrates together. Such fibrous applications have in the past been 
applied in parallel fine lines, in swirl patterns or in 
random fibrous fashion by means of a melt-blown slot 
die apparatus such as disclosed in 
US-A-4,720,252. Such apparatus provides a non-woven fibrous 
web in low basis weights and is stated to reduce 
clogging due to the use of a slot die as opposed to a 
plurality of small opening nozzles for each fibrous 
component. Small particles are said to pass the slot 
die, which might otherwise clog a single fiber nozzle 
orifice.  
 When such dies are used to produce low basis 
weight coatings, the slot thickness must be held at a 
narrow distance, which still may block slightly larger 
particles, resulting in clogging. Also, when adhesive 
is extruded through the slot, the extruded web tends to 
draw in or neck-in at the edges. This produces a "rail 
roading" effect in the deposited web, i.e. thickened 
edges and thinner center portions. While the air 
blowing on the web tends to reduce this effect, it can 
still be pronounced, and is undesirable. Moreover, such melt blowing apparatus is 
generally used in the production of non-woven webs and 
not in adhesive coatings in lamination. In the production of discrete coatings and 
adhesives for lamination of discrete substrate areas, 
for example, it is desirable to obtain broad, uniform 
fibrous coatings in a non-contact application process 
with sharp, square, cut-on and cut-off edges with no 
stringing of material. None of the processes currently 
known are entirely suitable for this application. Many various devices have been used to apply 
adhesives for lamination, including curtain coaters, 
contact coaters, spray coaters, and, more recently, 
fine line or spiral pattern application devices. 
Curtain coaters do not generally produce good cut-on, 
cut-off edges and are subject to neck-in. Contact 
coaters present the inherent disadvantage of wear and 
substrate index and tension tolerances. The spray,  
 
fine line and spiral pattern applicators

Apparatus for intermittent non-contact application of coatings to a 
substrate, said apparatus comprising: 


a slot nozzle having an extrusion channel (37) and an elongated slot 
outlet (40) disposed along said channel (37) through which coating material 

moving through said channel (37) is extruded; 
means in said channel (37) extending at least to said slot outlet (40) 
and for dividing said slot outlet (40) into a plurality of slot outlets (40) from 

which coating material exudes;
 
   characterized by at least one elongated air slot (61, 62) proximate said 

slot outlet (40) for impinging at least one air stream onto a coating material 
exuding from said slot outlet (40) to produce a fibrous web of coating 

material prior to application thereof to a substrate;
 
   wherein said coating material exuding from each said slot outlet (40) 

merges into coating material exuding from adjacent slot outlets (40) to form 
a continuous coating web prior to impingement of air thereon. 
Apparatus as in claim 1 wherein said dividing means extends outwardly 
beyond said slot outlet. 
Apparatus as in claim 1 wherein said dividing means includes a shim 
(45,45a) having a plurality of juxtaposed elongated projections (46) defining 

slots (47) therebetween, said projections (46) having tapered ends (48) 
terminating at the outlet (40) of said slot nozzle. 
Apparatus as in claim 1 further including means for starting the flow 
of air prior to extrusion of coating material from said slot outlet and means 

for stopping the flow of air after extrusion of coating material has ceased.  
 
Apparatus as in claim 4 including at least two air slots (61, 62), one 
proximate each side of said slot outlet (40) for impinging air therefrom onto 

coating material exuding from said slot outlet (40). 
Apparatus as in claim 5 further including means for initiating flow of 
air from the other air slot (61, 62) before coating material is extruded and 

for ceasing flow of air from said other air slot (61, 62) before extrusion of 
said coating material ceases.  

 
A method of producing a fibrous web of adhesive for non-contact 
deposition on a substrate comprising the steps of: 


supplying adhesive material to the slot of a slot nozzle die; 
dividing the adhesive material in said slot into a plurality of extruding 
streams of material emanating from said slot nozzle die in separate streams;
 
   characterized by impinging a flow of air on both sides of said curtain 

to produce a fibrous adhesive web for non-contact deposition onto the 
substrate and
 
   merging the streams together at the slot outlet (40) to form a curtain 

of adhesive material. 
A method as in claim 7 including starting and 
stopping the extrusion of coated material and the flow of 

impinging air at preselected different times to produce 
discrete coatings with even leading and trailing edges. 
A method as in claim 8 wherein the starting and 
stopping of coating material and impinging air flow includes 

the steps of starting said impinging air flow, starting 
extrusion of coating material, stopping extrusion of coating 

material and stopping air flow. 
A method as in claim 9 wherein the method 
includes impinging air on the coating material from both 

sides thereof, and the further steps of: 

starting a first flow of impinging air on one side 
of said slot nozzle; 
then extruding coating material from said nozzle 
for application to a substrate; 
then starting the second flow of impinging air 
onto said extruding coating material from another side of 

said slot nozzle; 
stopping said first flow of impinging air; 
then stopping said extrusion of material; and then 
stopping said second flow of impinging air.
