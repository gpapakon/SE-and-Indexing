<ABSTRACT>
A liquid photosensitive resin composition used for producing a corrugated board printing plate comprising 
100 parts by weight of an unsaturated polyurethane prepolymer (A) wherein the polyol segment comprises a polyether 

polyol, 17-200 parts by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated compound (B), and 0.01-10 parts by weight of a 
photopolymerization initiator (C), wherein the component (B) contains 17-65 parts by weight of an acrylate monomer 

represented by the general formula (I): CH₂ = CH-CO-O-(C₂H₄O)
n
-R, per 100 parts by weight of the component (A), 

wherein n represents a number of 1 to 20; and R represents C₂-C₂₂ linear or branched alkyl. A corrugated board 
printing plate produced by curing the composition has a remarkably enhanced impact resilience and enables favorable 

corrugated board printing without causing paper dust release from the form plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid photosensitive
resin composition used for forming a printing plate having an
increased impact resilience for printing on a corrugated board.
The printing plate has been strongly desired in the field of a
corrugated board printing.As a printing plate material for corrugated board
printing, there has been used a rubber, a solid photosensitive
resin and a liquid photosensitive resin. The liquid photosensitive
resin is often used as a printing material plate for corrugated
board printing because of the economic advantage that an unhardened
resin can be recovered and reused, and a feature that it provides a
good working environment since the development is done with aqueous
washout solution.A liquid photosensitive resin composition used for forming
a printing plate to print on a corrugated board generally comprises
a prepolymer having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond, an
ethylenically unsaturated compound and a photopolymerization
initiator. A printing plate used for corrugated board printing is
produced by imagewise exposing the liquid photosensitive resin 
composition to an actinic ray (photo-curing) and then conducting a
developing process, a post-exposure process and a drying process.One of the important physical properties required for a
printing plate used for corrugated board printing is impact
resilience. Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 35481/1978
(An improved photosensitive composition for use in forming a
flexographic printing plate) discloses that because a corrugated
board has a rough and corrugated surface, a flexographic printing
plate used for corrugated board printing having a low hardness
(Shore A) of 35 to 45 degrees, an excellent strength and an
excellent impact resilience is advantageous.European Patent Unexamined Publication No. 263366 ( A
photoresin printing plate for use in printing a corrugated board)
discloses the following. When corrugated board printing is
conducted by using a photosensitive resin plate having a low
hardness, paper dust or the like present on the surface of a
corrugated board supplied to a printing machine often adheres to
the surface of the printing plate. Because paper dust or the like,
once adhered, can not be easily released from the surface of the
printing plate, it is necessary to interrupt the operation of the
printing machine in order to clean the printing plate. Therefore
the photosensitive resin plate having a low hardness has a big
practical problem that the productivity or the yield of the
