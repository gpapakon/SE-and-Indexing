<ABSTRACT>
A battery charging system detects if multiple battery cells to be recharged 
include rechargeable, secondary batteries or non-rechargeable, primary batteries. 

If the system detects that any one of the cells is a primary battery, then the 
charging system halts the charging operation. If all of the cells are secondary 

batteries, but the polarity of any battery cell is incorrect, then the charging system 
halts the charging process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rechargeable batteries and. more particularly, to 
systems for charging of rechargeabie batteries and preventing charging of non-rechargeable 
batteries. Most conventional battery-operated consumer products utilize non-rechargeable, 
or primary, batteries that are available in standard battery cell 
sizes. Primary batteries are batteries such as carbon-zinc or alkaline batteries 
that must be discarded when fully discharged. Rechargeable, or secondary, 
batteries are batteries such as nickel-cadmium batteries that can be repeatedly 
charged and discharged for a significant number of cycles before they must be 
discarded. Most primary batteries, if subjected to the charging curreni provided 
by a charging circuit, will become damaged and will possibly damage the product 
or device in which the battery is placed. Traditionally, secondary batteries have been constructed with terminals 
and case configurations and sizes that are incompatible with the primary batteries 
that can be obtained by retail customers. More recently, secondary batteries have 
become available with terminals and in configurations and sizes identical to those 
of standard primary batteries. That is primary and secondary batteries are no 
longer physically distinguishable and are now interchangeable. This 
interchangeability makes it easy for a consumer to inadvertently place a primary 
battery into either a product with a battery charging circuit or a dedicated battery 
charger device with a charging circuit and then inadvertently attempt to recharge 
the primary battery. Efforts have been underway to prevent such inadvertent charging of primary batteries. For example, US-A-4,577,144 describes a battery charger that electrically determines if a battery cell being  
 
recharged is a primary battery or a secondary battery. Charging of a primary battery cell is 
inhibited and charging of a secondary battery cell is permitted. The US-Patent US-A-5,049,803 discloses an apparatus for charging and testing a 
rechargeable battery. The apparatus is adapted to determine certain conditions, 
including defects and characteristics, of the battery. The apparatus can automatically 
identify the operating characteristics of the battery, detect fault conditions, and carry 
out charging with high efficiency and speed. 
There is no 
indication that it is possible to detect a mixture of non-chargeable battery cells with 
rechargeable battery cells in the charging device. Battery chargers that electrically discriminate between a

A battery charging system (30) adapted to receive a plurality of battery 
cells (12) each having first and second electrical contacts and connected in series, 

the system (30) comprising a transformer circuit (32) that produces an output charging 
current and a primary reference voltage, a charging circuit (34), connected to the 

output of the transformer circuit (32), that includes first and second terminals (24) 
coupled to the first contact of the first battery cell (12) and the second contact of the 

last battery cell (12) connected in series, and that operates in a charging mode and a 
non-charging mode, and 

a battery type discriminating circuit (OA3) that detects the AC-coupled battery 
voltage across the first and second terminals during the charging mode and operates 

the charging circuit (34) in the non-charging mode if the detected AC-coupled battery 
voltage is higher than the primary reference voltage;

mode if the battery voltage across the first and second terminals is less than 

a predetermined secondary reference voltage;
 
and 
a charging indicator (OA4, LED1) that is steadily illuminated if the battery cells 
(12) are being recharged, is not illuminated if the reverse polarity detector (OA2) 

detects that the battery voltage is less than the secondary reference voltage, and is 
alternately illuminated on and off if the battery type discriminating circuit (OA3) 

detects that the AC-coupled battery voltage is higher than the primary reference 
voltage.
