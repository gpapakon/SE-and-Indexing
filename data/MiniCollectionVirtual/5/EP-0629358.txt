<ABSTRACT>
Internal shoe to be weared by a user foot and to be insetred in a sport boot, 
such as a ski-boot, provided with pockets (34, 36) to be filled by liquid matter and 

in-situ vulcanizable at room temperature, being said pockets (34, 36) arranged around 
a vamp area (12) covering heel and malleoli and inside a tongue (16) of the shoe 

itself, inserted between an internal waterproof lining (42) and either a standard 
padding (48) or an external vamp (50). Every pocket (34, 36) is provided with an 

inlet opening (38, 40), connectable to means (80) for injecting liquid silicone, 
containing a valve (90, 92) openable by thin pipes (94) for ejecting air bubbles and 

excess silicone when it is still liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with sport boots, specifically ski-boots, and 
refers to a shoe to be weared by a foot allowing a complet anatomic fit of a boot 
to a foot therein inserted. It is well known that ski-boots have an external rigid shell and, in order not to 
have the shod foot suffering from shocks or constrictions therein, the foot wears a 
padded shoe and then the shod foot is inserted into the rigid shell of the boot. 
Unfortunately uman feets have shape and size, which even ranging about average 
size and measures, do change from a person to another, so that it is difficult to 
carry out an internal shoe, having inserted paddings, providing a perfectly anatomic 
fit of the foot to the boot. A first method for providing such a fit consists in inserting into the shoe a 
rather short permanent padding and adding thereto further padding till obtaining a 
satisfactory fit between foot and boot. This a little rough method results rather time 
consuming and boring to be embodied and, unless many attempts are patiently and 
carefully carried out, risks to yeld mean results from the view point of the foot fit. To solve the problems of the above mentioned method, have been devised 
controlled compliance paddings, in accordance with the interested foot area, inserted 
into the vamp of a shoe and pushed against the foot by a pocket arranged between 
an external surface and the above mentioned paddings and to be filled by a liquid 
matter gelled and changeable in an elastomer (for example in a silicone elastomer of 
the room temperature vulcanizable kind changing in a short time, once has been 
applied, in an elastic rubbery matter). This method of the controlled paddings pushed 
by the elastomer has been disclosed and claimed in the U. S. Patent No. 5,067,257 
to Sven Coomer. From the disclosure of said patent and specifically having looked at 
figure 3, it is seen that are provided two different kinds of controlled paddings, one 
of not porous material indicated by the symbol P2 and one of porous material 
indicated by the symbol P3. The reasons for choosing porous or not porous materials 
seem reside in the fact that in some areas of the foot, such as the malleoli and the 
Achilles tendon, are needed a not very compliant padding whose stiffness must 
remain unchanged in order to fasten the foot in the boot and to transmit some 
strains from the foot to the boot, while in other areas, such as the heel, the ankle 
and the back of the foot should need a well softer padding whose stiffness can be

<CLAIMS>
Internal shoe, anatomically adaptable, provided with external standard padding (48) 
having even stiffness at any place characterized by inserting between said external 

padding (48) and an internal lining (42) at least a pocket (34) to be filled with a 
liquid material vulcanizable to an elastomer. 
Internal shoe, as in claim 1, characterized in that the internal lining (42) is made 
the thinnest the possible, consitently with the pressures to be applied to the liquid 

material, so that said liquid material is substantially in touch with the foot, in order 
to more carefully shape the consequent elastomer according to the anatomic shape of 

the foot. 
Internal shoe, as in claim 1, characterized in that the pockets to be filled are two 
in number, a first one (34) covering an area of the vamp (12) of the shoe coating 

the heel and the sides of the foot and a second one (36) inserted in the tongue (16) 
of the shoe itself. 
Internal shoe, as in claim 3, characterized in that the pockets (34, 36) to be filled 
have an inlet opening (38, 40) of the filling liquid provided with a stopping valve 

(90, 92) of the kind commonly used for the filling of air inflatable items. 
Internal shoe, as in preceding claims, characterized in that for the filling of the 
pockets (34, 36) is used an injection gun (80) hand actuated operating on a cartridge 

(82) filled with injectable matter. 
Internal shoe, as in claim 5, characterized in that the cartridge (82) is a double 
cartridge containing two components of a silicone elastomer room temperature 

vulcanizable, which are mixed at the injection time in the pockets (34, 36). 
Filling method of the pockets (34, 36) of the internal shoe according to the 
claims 1 to 5 characterized by separately injecting the silicone into the heel pocket 

(34) and the tongue pocket (36). 
Filling method, as in claim 7, characterized in that once injected the silicone, it 
is unformly distributed in the pockets (34, 36) by means of a manual massage 

thereon. 
Filling method, as in claim 7, characterized in that are provided means to open 
the stop valves (90, 92) of the inlet openings (38, 40) to the pockets (34, 36) to 

eject air bubbles and any excess of the silicone itself when it is still liquid. 
Filling method, as in claim 9, characterized in that the means to open the stop 
valves consist of pipes (94) to be inserted into the openings (38, 40) of the pockets 

(34, 36) to open the valves (90, 92).
