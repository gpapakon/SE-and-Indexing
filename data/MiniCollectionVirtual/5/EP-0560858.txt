<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for controlling flow which comprises: a) a housing member (102) having an internal chamber through which fluid is adapted to flow; and b) a static infill member (116) located within the chamber and forming a passageway (120, 122, 128) for the flow of fluid between the internal wall of the chamber and the external wall of the support chamber, which passageway is dimensioned so as to restrict the back flow of fluid therethrough at an ambient pressure differential. Preferably, the internal chamber and the infill member are circular in cross-section and the passageway is provided by the annular gap between the opposing axial walls of the chamber and the infill member. The invention also provides a nozzle assembly incorporating the flow control device and spray generating devices incorporating the nozzle assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spray-generating devices which include nozzle 
assemblies. Many forms of device have been proposed for dispensing 
fluids, for example medicaments, as sprays of fine droplets 
or aerosols. In some forms of device, it has been proposed 
that the aqueous solution of the medicament or other active 
ingredient be discharged through a fine orifice nozzle to 
form the spray using mechanical pressuring means, for 
example using a compressed spring to drive a piston in a 
cylinder containing the fluid; in others, a pressurised gas 
is used as the propellant. For convenience the term 
pressurising means will be used herein to denote all means 
by which the pressure required to dispense the fluid is 
generated and includes mechanical and pressurised gas 
operated means. Where very small nozzle apertures, for example those having 
a diameter of 10 micrometres or less, are used to form fine 
droplets sizes, it is important to ensure that such small 
orifice apertures do not become blocked. It has therefore 
been proposed to provide a filter in the fluid discharge 
line upstream of the nozzle aperture. Small dimension 
filters are available, and these typically comprise a mesh 
or gauze which has a mesh aperture size as low as 3 
micrometres or less. However, such filters are flimsy and 
therefore require some support means to prevent rupturing 
under the large pressures generated by the pressuring means. 
Furthermore, such filters and their support means are 
additional and often expensive components.  
 There is, therefore, a continuing requirement for an 
effective and reliable filter capable of filtering fluid 
stream down to very small particle sizes. In spray 
generating devices, there is usually also a requirement for 
a non-return valve positioned between the pressurising means 
and the atomising nozzle orifice so as to reduce the risk of 
residual fluid in the nozzle assembly draining back into the 
pressurization chamber and contaminating fluid held in a 
reservoir in the device. We have devised a form of nozzle assembly incorporating a 
non-return means which provides a simple and 
effective means for reducing the risk of drain back of fluid 
from the nozzle assembly and may also be used to provide the 
functions of a filter and/or a filter gauze support in the 
nozzle assembly. Patent document EP-A-387473 describes a noise-reduction filter for 
sanitary installations comprising a cylindrical member with longitudinal 
bores. EP-A-379818 describes a chamber in a device for

<CLAIMS>
A spray generating device which comprises: 

a. pressurising means for applying a predetermined amount of 
energy by means of a spring loaded pump mechanism to a metered quantity 

of fluid in order to subject the fluid to a predetermined increase in 
pressure, said pump mechanism having retaining means for retaining the 

pump mechanism in a loaded state at which the fluid in the pump is held 
at ambient pressure, and means for releasing the retaining means, thereby 

to cause the said predetermined increase in pressure in the fluid; and 
b. means for atomising the pressurised fluid into droplets which 
incorporates a nozzle assembly comprising a conduit (128, 122; 13, 15) 

in fluid flow communication with a nozzle aperture (106; 14) through 
which fluid is to be discharged as a spray of droplets, wherein 

the effective minimum cross-sectional area of the conduit (128, 122; 
13, 15) transverse to the line of flow of fluid at the point of effective 

minimum area is selected so that flow of fluid through said conduit is 
restricted by the minimum effective cross-sectional area whereby back-flow 

of fluid from said nozzle aperture (106; 14) through said conduit 
at an ambient pressure differential is substantially prevented, the 

ambient pressure differential being the pressure across the nozzle 

assembly when the spray generating device is in its rest condition or the 
device is being re-cocked in preparation for a subsequent discharge 

stroke. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the conduit is a fine 
bore tube and the effective cross-sectional area is the transverse cross-section 

of the fine bore. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the conduit is a 
chamber of greater cross-sectional area than the nozzle aperture, and 

wherein a static infill member (116; 12) is located within said conduit 
(128, 122; 13, 15) so as to occupy at least part of the cross-section of 

said chamber.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 3, wherein one or more 
passageway(s) (128, 122; 13, 15) are provided through the infill member 

(116; 12) and/or between the opposing end walls and/or side wall(s) of 
the conduit and said infill member. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the conduit is 
provided as a blind ended axial chamber having the nozzle aperture (106; 

14) located at or adjacent the blind end of the chamber, and the infill 
member (116; 12) is substantially congruent with the internal transverse 

end wall and/or the axial side walls of at least the blind end of the 
chamber and is a clearance fit therein to form the passageway(s) (128, 

122; 13, 15) between the radially and/or axially opposed walls of the 
chamber and the infill member. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein the 
maximum cross-sectional dimension of the passageway(s) (128, 122; 13, 15) 

is less than the minimum dimension of the nozzle aperture (106; 14), 
whereby the passageway(s) serves both as a flow restrictor to reduce back 

flow of fluid and as a filter for the fluid flowing through the nozzle 
assembly. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
nozzle assembly also comprises a filter element (110). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein there is no significant flow of fluid through the nozzle assembly 

when a pressure differential of 0.2 bar is applied across the assembly. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the conduit 
comprises: 


a. a housing member (102; 11) having an internal chamber through 
which fluid is to flow; and 
b. a static infill member (116; 12) located within the chamber 
and forming a passageway (128; 13) for the flow of fluid between the  

 
internal wall of the chamber and the external wall of the infill member 

(116; 12). 
Use of a device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
for discharging a fluid as a spray of droplets, in which device there is no 

significant flow of fluid through the nozzle assembly when a pressure 
differential of 0.2 bar is applied across the assembly. 
Use of a device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 for 
dispensing a metered quantity of a fluid medicament.
