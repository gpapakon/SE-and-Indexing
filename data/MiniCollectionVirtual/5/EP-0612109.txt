<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated device (component) and a process for producing the same are described. The device has a P
<
+
>
 structure which is embedded in a semiconductor layer and is partially overlapped by an N
<
+
>
 structure and coated with an oxide layer. Long-term stabilisation of the breakdown voltage is guaranteed in the case of zener diodes with breakdown at the surface. It is provided for this purpose that the oxide layer (20) is stripped in a region (35) and that there is arranged there an oxide layer (36) which has windows (22, 24) which define the region of the P
<
+
>
 structure (14) and the region of the N
<
+
>
 structure (16). A polysilicon web (30) is arranged in the overlap region (32) above the PN junction (18).
