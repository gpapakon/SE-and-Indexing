<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector housing 
positioning unit. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a connector housing positioning unit for 
positioning connector housings in predetermined positions in 
order to insert terminals fixed to ends of electric wires to 
the connector housing in manufucturing of a wire harness. Generally, a wire harness employed in an automobile and 
the like is an electric wiring system composed of a bundle of 
plural electric wires that are cut to a predetermined 
dimension. The manufacturing process of such a wire harness 
includes the steps of measuring and cutting electric wires to a 
predetermined length, stripping insulating sheaths at the ends of 
the wires cut to a predetermined length, crimping crimp 
terminals to stripped core at the ends of wires, inserting the 
crimped terminals to a connector housing and bundling the 
wires connected to the connector housing.  
 The steps for manufacturing wire harnesses are being 
automated for the purpose cf such rationalizations as 
reduction in time and cost required for producing a wire 
harness. Specifically, in the step of inserting a terminal, 
various automatic apparatuses have been proposed for automatically 
inserting a terminal to a connector housing. Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 63-174224, for example, 
discloses a terminal inserting apparatus for inserting 
terminals to connector housings juxtaposed in a predetermined 
direction with spaces therebetween. In a practical 
application of such a terminal inserting apparatus, there is 
required a connector housing feeding apparatus for positioning 
connector housings placed side by side, and feeding the 
juxtaposed connector housings to the terminal inserting 
apparatus. In such a connector housing feeding apparatus, a 
high efficiency and versatility that provide an 
applicability to various types of wire harnesses are 
demanded. In other words, the wire harnesses have to 
be accommodated which are different in the number of 
connectors and circuits depending on their particular 
product applications. In addition, the more 
complicated the wiring of a particular product is, 
then the greater likelihood there will be that a wide 
variety of connector housings may be involved. Thus, 
a connector housing feeding apparatus for efficiently 
and versatilely producing various wire harnesses is 
required.  
 Conventional connector housing feeding apparatuses, 
however, are designed for specific applications, and insufficient in 
such efficiency and
