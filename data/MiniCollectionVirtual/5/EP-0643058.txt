<ABSTRACT>
A method for selectively obtaining any one of an 
anhydrate, a 1/2 hydrate, a 1 hydrate, and a 3/2 hydrate of 

7-[(7-(S)-amino-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptan-5-yl]
-8-chloro-6-fluoro-1-[(1R,2S)-2-fluorocyclopropyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid is disclosed, comprising 

treating the compound in an aqueous solvent or water or

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crystals of compound (I) without
water of crystallization (hereinafter referred to as anhydrate
form or anhydrate, simply), to a method for selectively
preparing these crystals and crystals containing water of
crystallization (hereinafter referred to as hydrate form or
hydrate, simply), and further to pharmaceutical preparations
containing such a crystalline form.A quinolone derivative represented by formula (I):

i.e., 7-[(7-(S)-amino-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6-fluoro-1-[(1R,2S)-2-fluorocyclopropyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic
acid (hereinafter referred to
as compound (I)), has high antimicrobial activity with
excellent safety (cf. EP-A-0 341 493 or JP-A-2-231475; the
term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published
Japanese Patent Application") and is expected to be an
excellent synthetic antimicrobial agent. It was found that the compound (I) can exist in the
form of several kinds of hydrate forms other than a 1/4
(0.25) hydrate, such as a 1/2 (0.5) hydrate (i.e.,
hemihydrate), a 1 hydrate (i.e., monohydrate), and a 3/2
(1.5) hydrate (i.e., sesquihydrate, see JP 90/279 778). It was also found that
an anhydrate form exists in addition to these hydrates.Hydrate form of compound (I) include plural types of
crystals having different number of crystal water molecules.
Depending on the conditions for crystallization or
recrystallization, plural types of hydrates are formed in the
resulting crystals, and such crystals are unsuitable as a
bulk material for solid pharmaceutical preparations.As a result of extensive investigations, the present
inventors have found that it is possible to selectively
prepare crystals of specific hydrate or anhydrate of compound
(I) by controlling the conditions for crystallization or
recrystallization. The present invention was completed based
on this finding.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a
method for selectively obtaining a 3/2 hydrate of compound
(I) in crystalline form which comprises treating 7-[(7-(S)-amino-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6-fluoro-1-[(1R,25)-2-fluorocyclopropyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic
acid 
in an aqueous solvent
wherein the minimum water content of said aqueous solvent
depends on the temperature such that said water content is at
least 40 % at 25°C and at least 90 % at 60°C, or recrystallizing
7-[(7-(S)-amino-5-azaspiro[2.4]heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6-fluoro-1-[(1R,2S)-2-fluorocyclopropyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic
