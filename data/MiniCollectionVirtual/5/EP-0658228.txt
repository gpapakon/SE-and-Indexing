<ABSTRACT>
Mixtures of paper sizing agents are produced by mixing an aqueous suspension of a hydrolyzed cationic starch with fine particle aqueous polymer dispersions which constitute a paper sizing agent, and by emulsifying C14-C22-alkyl diketens in said mixture at temperatures of at least 70  C. The mixtures are used for paper beater and surface sizing.
