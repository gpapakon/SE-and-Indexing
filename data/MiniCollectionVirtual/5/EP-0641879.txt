<ABSTRACT>
In a method for knitting Intarsia patterns on flat-bed knitting machines, by simple handling fault-free patterned knits are produced by fixing the Intarsia thread knitting in the Intarsia region (I) at the start and at the end of the Intarsia region (I) by means of a stitch. Fixing is preferably carried out by transferring a stitch previously knitted with the Intarsia thread on one needle bed (h) onto the other needle bed (v) and by the subsequent knitting of the Intarsia thread on the other needle bed (v) in the Intarsia region (I).

Method for knitting intarsia patterns on flat bed
knitting machines in which the intarsia yarn being

knitted in the intarsia region (I) is fixed at the
beginning and at the end of the intarsia region (I) by

means of a stitch, whereby the stitch is formed by
transferring a stitch that was previously knitted with

the intarsia yarn on one needle bed (h) onto the other
needle bed (v) and subsequent knitting-up of the intarsia

yarn on the other needle bed (V) in the intarsia region
(I).
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that
the stitch is formed within the intarsia region (I).
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that
racking of the needle beds (h, v) by at least one needle

pitch is effected before the transfer.
Method in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised by the following method steps:


a) forming a stitch with the intarsia yarn on a needle of
said one needle bed (h) which is located in the border

area of the intarsia region (I);
b) transferring the stitch of intarsia yarn onto a needle
of the other needle bed (v), and
c) knitting an intarsia-yarn row on the other needle bed
(v) in the intarsia region (I).
Method in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that
the needle beds (h, v) are racked relative to one another

by at least one needle pitch prior to the transfer of the
stitch of intarsia yarn onto the other needle bed (v). 
Method in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that
the racking is effected in a direction such that the

stitch of intarsia yarn is displaced towards the intarsia
region (I).
Method in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the intarsia yarn is fed into the

intarsia region (I) or is drawn off from the intarsia
region (I) by forming tuck stitches on one needle bed

(v).
Method in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that
the tuck stitches are formed on that one needle bed (h)

which does not include any stitches of the basic fabric
(G).
Method in accordance with Claim 7 or 8, characterised in
that stitches of the basic fabric (G) are temporarily

hung on needles which are adjacent to the needles
carrying the tuck stitches and which are in the same

needle bed (h), in order to prevent the tuck stitches
from being dropped.
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 7 to 9,
characterised by the following method steps:


a) the intarsia yarn is inserted in every other needle of
the other needle bed in the basic fabric region (G) up to

the beginning of the intarsia region (T) or as from the
end of the intarsia region (I);
b) every other stitch of the basic knitting in the basic
fabric region (G) is transferred from the other needle

bed (v) onto the oppositely located free needles of the
one needle bed (h);
c) the tuck stitches of intarsia yarn are dropped from
the needles of said one needle bed (h) in the basic

fabric region (G); 
d) the stitches of the basic knitting in the basic fabric
region (G) are rehung from said one needle bed (h) onto

oppositely located needles of the other needle bed (v).
Method in accordance with any of the preceding Claims,
characterised by the following method steps:


a) each of the stitches of the basic knitting in the
basic fabric region (G) is transferred from one needle

bed (h) onto the other needle bed (v);
b) tuck stitches of intarsia yarn are formed on every
other needle of the one needle bed (h) in the basic

fabric region up to the lateral beginning of the intarsia
region (I) or as from the lateral end thereof;
c) every other stitch of the basic knitting in the basic
fabric region (G) is transferred from the other needle

bed (v) onto the oppositely located free needles of the
one needle bed (h);
d) tuck stitches of intarsia yarn are formed alternately
on every other needle of the one and the other needle

beds (h, v) in the intarsia region (I);
e) a stitch of intarsia yarn is formed on that second or
penultimate needle of the one needle bed (h) which is

located in the intarsia region and which carries a tuck
stitch of intarsia yarn;
f) the needle beds (h, v) are racked relative to one
another by at least one needle pitch;
g) the stitches of intarsia yarn that were knitted in
accordance with method step e) are transferred onto the

other needle bed (v);
h) the needle beds (h, v) are racked relative to one

another back into their original position;
i) at least one intarsia-yarn low is knitted in the
intarsia region (I);
j) the tuck stitches of intarsia yarn formed in
accordance with method step h) are dropped from every

other needle of the one needle bed (h) in the basic 
fabric region (G), and
k) the respective stitches of the basic knitting in the
basic fabric region (G) are transferred from one needle

bed (h) onto oppositely located needles of the other
needle bed (v).
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 7 to 11,
characterised in that at least one stitch of the basic

knitting located at a certain distance from the intarsia
region (I) remains on at least one needle of the needle

bed (h) upon which the tuck stitches are formed (Figs. 2b
or 2k).
