<ABSTRACT>
A device for use in light-beam treatment comprises an 
elongated light source (1) and a concentrating reflector (2) with a 

reflecting surface in the form of a surface of rotation with a 
generatrix consisting of a number of sections (3) joined together. 

The form of the surface generatrix of the reflector at any section 
other than the initial one (situated in the vicinity of the apex M 

of the reflector (2)) and the joining boundaries are determined by 
the system of equations. The initial profile segment of the 

reflector (2) from the apex M to the point R₁, Z₁ has the same 
form as a segment of a second order curve. On the face side of the 

concentrating reflector is mounted a hermetically protective 
transparent partition (4), the cross section of which is designed 

with a view to allowing additional focusing of the assigned light 
fractions from the linear source (1) at the focal point F.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to illumination engine-ring 
and, more particularly, to technical means for concentration 
of optical radiation. It can be used in beam machining 
such as soldering and welding of sheet materials. It 
will also prove its worth in manufacture and repairs of automobile 
bodies, in manufacture of metal roofs of buildings and 
structures and in other fields that rely upon a dependable and 
safe device for local heating of the surfaces of parts. Devices for concentration of energy of optical radiation 
have long been utilized for realization of various technological 
processes involving local surface heating of the machined 
material. Known in the prior art is a beam machining device comprising 
a reflector whose reflecting surface has the shape of an 
ellipsoid of revolution with an arc source of light installed 
in one of its foci while its other focus is combined with the 
surface of the material to be machined (US Patent No.3774995, 
Cl.350294, IPC-5:G 02 B 5/10, 1973). One of the disadvantages 
of this device lies in its large dimensions when it uses powerful 
light sources. Another known beam machining device comprises 
a reflector in the form of coaxially and successively installed 
main and auxiliary ellipsoids interconnected by an annular 
member. A pin-point light source is disposed in the common 
radiating focus of said ellipsoids while the surface of 
the handled material is conjugated with the second focus of 
the main ellipsoid. A mirror installed between the second focus 
of the auxiliary ellipsoid and the second focus of the main 
ellipsoid in the plane perpendicular to the common axis of 
said ellipsoids directs the radiation reflected by the surface 
of the auxiliary ellipsoid into the location point of the second 
focus of the main ellipsoid (laid-open application of FRG 
No.3 319 562, OPC-5:F 2IV 7/09, 1984). The use of a reflector with its surface in the form of an  
 
ellipsoid of revolution within an interval from the reflector 
apex to the point of the radiating focus increases overly the 
size of the optical radiator in an attempt to increase the distance 
from the point of radiation to the reflector apex for 
reducing the thermal load on the reflector walls, said load 
being inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
from the point of radiation to the reflector surface. Along 
with it, the increased thermal load on reflector walls distorts 
the shape of the reflector which changes its optical 
properties. This adverse effect can be

<CLAIMS>
A beam machining device comprising a pin-point source 
of optical radiation and a concentrating reflector whose reflecting 

surface has the form of a surface of revolution with 
a generatrix constituted partly by an arc of an ellipse whose 

larger axis is coincident with the axis of rotation, one of 
its foci is coincident with the radiation source while the 

other one, with the surface of the material being machined 
CHARACTERIZED in that the surface of revolution of the concentrating 

reflector has a generatrix made up of the arcs of 
confocal ellipses, lengths of rays interconnecting the ends 

of said arcs and emitted from the focus coincident with the 
source of radiation, and of the arcs of circles with the center 

in said focus, the size of the generatrix segments and 
their relative positioning being selected so that any straight 

line passing through the point coincident with the radiation 
source and intersecting the reflector surface on the segment 

with the generatrix in the form of an arc of a circle intersects 
the reflector surface, and on the segment with the 

generatrix in the form of an arc of an ellipse any straight 
line passing through the focal point coincident with the surface 

of the machined material has only one point of intersection 
with the reflecting surface of the concentrating reflector 

while the number of arcs of generatrix ellipses k, the 
number of lengths of rays n and the number of arcs of circles 

m are interrelated by a relationship 
k = n + m + 1  

 where 
n and m are whole numbers, n, m = 0, 1, 2 ... .
