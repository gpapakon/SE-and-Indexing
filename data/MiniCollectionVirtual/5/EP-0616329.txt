<ABSTRACT>
A booster circuit which can cancel the back bias 
effect, can prevent the increase of the surface area of 

the circuit and the power consumption, prevent the 
complication of the clock generation circuit, and prevent 

lowering of the current capability, wherein a boosting 
stage is constituted by forming an nMOS transistor NT for 

carrying the charges and nMOS transistor NTB for 
transferring the voltage inside a p-well formed inside an 

n-well which is formed on a p-type semiconductor substrate 
and biased to a predetermined potential, constituted so 

that the source voltage of the nMOS transistor NT for 
carrying the charges which rise at the boosting is 

transferred via the nMOS transistor NTB for transferring 
the voltage to the substrate, that is, the p-well, whereby 

the back bias effect is suppressed.
