<ABSTRACT>
A multiple access communications data and information transport system and methodology for employing the noise present in any conduit as a carrier form using wireless chaotic waveform signals supported by nonlinear noise sustaining structures. The communications system utilizes digital devices and software embodying various algorithms designed to manipulate the nonlinear perturbations of any given conduit to establish a high bandwidth bidirectional, isochronous noise immune communications signal. Additionally, the system can be combined with any of a number of wireless or wireline communication methodologies to further enhance performance in terms of bandwidth, throughput, noise immunity, power consumption, cell size, and number of users without disturbing any concurrent signal traffic. In further embodiments, the invention can be embedded into a plurality of user terminals or electronic devices linked to each other or to other services through both existing and emerging wireless and wired communications services.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NONLINEAR DIGITAL COiViMUNICATIONS SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a communication system which can use existing telecommunication or power infrastructures to provide higher data transfer volumes, at improved transmission throughput rates, and over a broader bandwidth. More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus and method for carrying a desired signal on the noise components inherent to a particular conduit.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIncreasing the bandwidth of data transfer on transmission conduits is extremely important in today's high volume information transmission environment. The need for broader telecommunication bandwidths comes from several modern data transmission requirements. First, the higher bandwidths allow larger volumes of data to transmit in a shorter amount of time. This has become increasingly important as the size of data transmissions has continually grown. Modern examples of this desire for broader telecommunications bandwidths include the medical community's desire to transmit optical images of, for example, x-rays and CAT scans between remote hospitals and physicians. Such transmissions require greater bandwidths to transmit the large size data files in reasonable amounts of time. Another example is the desire for interactive video in homes and offices, for such applications as in-home movies-on-demand and video teleconferencing. The size of the data files to provide home video and real time video are simply too large to be feasibly transmitted without large increases in the available effective transmission throughput. 

 Conventional approaches to signal transmission on conductive wire lines is to voltage modulate a signal onto the conduit at a frequency that lies within the bounds at which the conduit can electrically conduct the signal. Because of this conventional approach, known modes of conductive wireline transmission are limited in available bandwidth to a spectrum within which the conductive wire line is able to electrically transmit the signal via voltage modulation yielding a current flow. As a result, costly and complicated schemes have been developed to increase the bandwidth and throughput in conventional conductive wireline communications systems using sophisticated switching schemes or signal time-sharing arrangements. Each of these methods is rendered costly and complex in part because the systems adhere to the conventional acceptance that the conductive wire line provides an available bandwidth constrained by its conductive
