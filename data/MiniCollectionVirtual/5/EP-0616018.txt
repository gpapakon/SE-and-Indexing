<ABSTRACT>
Adhesive composition in solution based on hydrogenated linear styrene block copolymers and capable of being sprayed with a compressed air gun and with an aerosol making it possible to manufacture and employ adhesives which form a mist of adherent and filament-free fine particles when being discharged through the orifice of a spraying system, even with high binder concentrations. The adhesive consists of a mixture of solvents rich in volatile aliphatics, ecological propellants and at least 3 % by weight of a binder consisting of hydrogenated linear styrene block copolymers, hydrogenated tackifiers with a high softening temperature, hydrogenated plasticising oils or saturated aliphatic liquid resins or hydrogenated tackifiers which are liquid at ambient temperature, antioxidant, UV stabiliser, adhesion promoter, fillers and aromatic resins. The composition is particularly intended for the manufacture of repositionable adhesives, of definitive or temporary fastenings employed in the graphic arts, textile and leather industries and in office, decoration and DIY activities.
