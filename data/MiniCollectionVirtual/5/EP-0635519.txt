an aqueous extract of 
Tanjin
 having the following 
characteristics: 


A. Sugar content: 60 to 100 % 

(1) Sugar composition:
 

40 to 80 % of uronic acid (composed almost 

entirely of D-galacturonic acid) and
 

10 to 30 % of neutral sugars 
(2) Neutral sugar composition:
 

0 to 15 % of rhamnose
 

0 to 15 % of glucose
 

25 to 55 % of galactose
 

30 to 60 % of arabinose

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safe therapeutic
agent for oral and intramuscular application which can be
administered to patients diagnosed to be afflicted with
renal diseases, including nephrotic syndrome, and patients
with hepatic disorders such as viral or drug-induced
hepatitis, thereby permitting such patients to attend
hospitals as an outpatient. In this connection, it should
be noted that such renal diseases in recent years tend to
occur with greater frequency, not only in the senile but
also in younger generations, and that nephrotic syndrome is
considered to be a step in inducing chronic renal
insufficiency.Renal or kidney diseases can be roughly classified
into the primary type involving glomeruli and the secondary
type originating from other diseases, with the former
accounting for more than 80% of total onset and occurring
more frequently in the younger generation (about 90%).
From the standpoint of histopathological findings, the
diseases are grouped into, for example, minimal change
nephrotic syndrome, glomerulosclerosis, membranous
nephritis, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (IgA
nephritis and non-IgA nephritis), membranous proliferative
glomerulonephritis, and crescent-forming glomerulonephritis.
Proteinuria is observed as a clinical finding
commonly among all these histopathological types of
diseases, whereby serious proteinuria leads to the
diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Since kidney diseases,
especially those induced by organic degeneration of the
kidney, occur increasingly not only in the old or senile
but also younger generations, there is strong demand for a
water-soluble drug having reduced side effects which is
able to be administered to patients orally or intramuscularly 
to treat the disorders through organic
amelioration.As internal therapeutic drugs for lipoid nephrosis or
minimal change nephrotic syndrome, there have been employed
chemically synthesized steroids or dipyridamole, an anti-platelet
drug. However, these drugs require prolonged
administration and, upon application to the younger
generation, are accompanied with great apprehension for the
onset of side effects, such as full-moon face, menstrual
disorders, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, as
well as, in serious cases, infections, gastrointestinal
bleeding, metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, thrombosis,
adrenal insufficiency and mental disorders.Hepatitis, which is roughly categorized into the viral
type and the type induced by drugs such as alcohol, is
caused overwhelmingly by infection
