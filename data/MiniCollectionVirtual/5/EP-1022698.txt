<ABSTRACT>
The present patent is described as being an equipment for automatic preservation, cooking
and vending of cooked or uncooked food in general which, by reason of its characteristics, is

provided not only with the vending function, but also those of storage, refrigeration and
cooking. It has a specific design and shape, is easily accessed for better adaptation and

safety, easy handling and installation features, is of accessible cost and, by reason of its
characteristics and dimensions, is adaptable to any place and product. The present patent

comprises the utilization of a modern and efficient equipment for fully automated food
vending having the function of receiving money and storing, refrigerating, heating (if

necessary) and delivering the food in a quick and hygienic manner. The patent in question
comprises a single equipment di
vided into modules for storage and refrigeration, heating,
transportation and electronic control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent relates to vending equipment in general, more specifically to an
equipment for the automatic preservation, cooking and vending of cooked and uncooked
food in general which, by its novel characteristics, is provided not only with the vending
function, but also those of storage, refrigeration, heating and cooking. It has a specific
design and shape, and easily accessible for better adaptation to and safety of the user,
characteristics of easy handling and installation, of quite accessible cost, easily
transportable and by reason of its characteristics and dimensions, is easily adaptable to any
place and product.It is quite versatile, due to its material and shape and basic modules, in addition to the low
manufacturing cost, ease of operation and great safety for the user, thereby differing from
other ordinary models known in the state of the art.The patent in question improves and adds devices in a new concept. This concept provides
a more efficient, low-cost and functional product, without prejudice to its technical qualities,
thereby providing the invention with advantages and improvements, the characteristics of
which differ from the other ordinary models known in the state of the art.The present patent comprises the utilization of a modem, efficient and safe equipment for
the fully automated sale of foods in general to the public and that has the function of
receiving money and storing foods under refrigeration and delivering them to the user in a
refrigerated, warmed or cooked condition, in a quick, hygienic, cheap and satisfactory
manner. The patent in question comprises a single equipment made of steel or the like, of equal or
higher lightness and strength, generally divided into a storage and refrigeration module, a
transportation module, a heating and cooking module and an electronic control module with
collection of money.There is at present a faster pace in the way of life in the large cities and people are having
less time to dedicate themselves to fundamental activities of the human being, such as food
and recreation. In addition to these factors, the lack of room, expensive labor and high
operational costs leave a portion of the market without options for quick, low-cost and
hygienic meals, the consumer being unassisted in respect of his/her food needs. This takes
place particularly in constant attendance places, during the twenty-four hours of the day,
where the sales volume and the operational cost for the implementation of a sales point with
an employee render the
