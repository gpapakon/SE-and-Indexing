<ABSTRACT>
Monitoring a light-off catalyst (12, 15) in 
conjunction with an internal combustion engine (10) includes 

providing exhaust gas oxygen sensors (20, 21, 22, 23) 
upstream and downstream of the light-off catalyst (12, 15) 

for monitoring operation of the catalyst. The monitoring is 
disabled when the mass air flow through the light-off 

catalyst (12, 15) is so high that the catalyst monitor is 
saturated and unable to detect the operation of the light-off 

catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic engine control
and diagnostics for an internal combustion engine.Internal combustion engines can have a catalyst in
the exhaust path to reduce the occurrence of certain
gases coming out of the exhaust path. Further, often it
is desirable to determine the operating condition of any
such catalysts. In certain low emission vehicles there is
a light-off catalyst in the exhaust gas stream which must
be monitored for hydrocarbon (HC) efficiency. The light-off
catalyst is a relatively small, quickly acting catalyst
typically used in combination with a large, slower acting
main catalyst. However, since the light-off catalyst if
usually a very small volume catalyst, the efficiency will
be low at the high space velocities experienced over
most of the time of engine operation. As a result, an onboard
diagnostic monitor for catalyst efficiency will be
saturated and cannot detect when the light-off catalyst
has deteriorated. It would be desirable to be able to determine
when such a catalyst has deteriorated.In United States Patent 5,233,829 there is described
an exhaust system for an exhaust line for an internal
combustion engine comprising: an upstream catalytic
convertor means, disposed in said exhaust gas;
downstream catalytic convertor means, disposed downstream
from said upstream catalytic convertor means in
said exhaust line, for purifying exhaust gas; a first emission
sensor, disposed upstream from said upstream catalytic
convertor means in said exhaust line, for detecting
an emission level of exhaust gas; a second emission
sensor, disposed between said upstream catalytic convertor
means and said downstream catalytic convertor
means in said exhaust line, for detecting an emission
level of exhaust gas; and a third emission sensor, disposed
downstream from said downstream catalytic convertor
means in said exhaust line, for detecting an emission
level of exhaust gas. The exhaust system is provided
with means for detecting deterioration of said
downstream catalytic convertor means but makes no
provision for ascertaining the efficiency of the upstream
catalytic convertor means.An onboard diagnostic monitor for catalyst efficiency
of a low emission vehicle light-off catalyst can use
the following steps. First an exhaust gas oxygen (EGO)
sensor is provided upstream (front) and downstream
(rear) of the light-off catalyst that is being monitored.
Second, for mass air flow regions where the space velocity
is so high that the catalyst monitor is saturated
(unable to detect a high
