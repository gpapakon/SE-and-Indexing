<ABSTRACT>
An inner bag for a container (6), which is open at the top at least after its initial use, is sealed after it has been filled and is intended to have an upper part (2) separated in a peripheral region (4) above the contents in order thus to allow the contents to be removed in a manner open at the top, consists of at least two paper layers (7, 8) and a bonding (5) between at least two paper layers (7, 8) in the region (4). The bonding (5) between the paper layers (7, 8) brings about sufficient stability of the wall of the paper bag for the rapid and precise separation of the upper part (2) from the lower part (3) of the inner bag (1).
