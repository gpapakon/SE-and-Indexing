<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an alloyed metal horseshoe for the 
race horse. The objective of the invention is to provide an alloyed 

metal horseshoe for the race horse, which is light in weight, of great 
expansibility and hardness with high abrasion resistance, shock absorption 

and ductility, capable of modifying a little of the horseshoe 
to suit the form of the horsehoof at the time of fitting, that can 

rationalize the manufacturing process with heat treatment omitted. 
The present invention consists of the alloyed metal for use as horseshoe 
of the race horse, made by mixing and dissolving Si:0.05-0.10%, 

Fe:0.05-0.10%(WT),Cu:0. 10-0. 20%(WT), Mn:0. 10-0. 20%(WT), Mg:3.00-5. 
00%(WT), Cr:0. 05-0. 15% Zn:0. 05-0. 10%, and Al:96. 6-94. 15%(WT) in 

an electric furnace, and the horseshoe thus manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a horseshoe for race horses, made of a magnesium rich aluminium alloy. 
The object of this invention is to 
provide a light horseshoe for race horses excellent in abrasion resistance, 
shock absorption, and in ductility. The horseshoe should primarily be light with ductility so that its 
shape may be changed a little to correctly fit on the horsehoof. It 
should also have abrasion resistance to long endure frictions with 
the surface of the track and reduce the shock that occurs at the 
time of stepping on the track surface. Since the conventional horseshoes were heavy as having been made mainly 
of mild steel, and poor in shock absorption because of their insufficient 
ductility, shoes have recently been made of alloyed aluminium 
buried with elastic shock-absorbing materials such as rubber and 
plastics but found difficult to protect the hooves and knee joints of the 
horse because of defects from their complex and easily breakable 
structure. Since a race horse runs at a speed of 60 Km/Hr during a race undergoing 
a shock of 1 ton in a moment (0. 017 second). the horseshoesmust 
be excellent in abrasion resistance and shock absorption and ductile  
 
enough to change their shape a little so as to suit the diverse sizes and 
forms of the hooves at the time of fitting on the later. To improve and solve the problems of the conventional mild steel 
or aluminium horseshoes, the present invention relates to a 
horseshoe made of a magnesium rich aluminium alloy comprising in weight : 
Si ; 0.05 - 0.10 %, Fe : 0.05 - 0.10 % ; Cu : 0.10 - 0.20 % ; Mn : 0.10 - 0.20 % ; 
Mg : 3.00 - 5.00 % ; Cr : 0.05 - 0.15 % ; Zn : 0.05 - 0.10 % and Al : 96.6 - 94.15 % This alloy 
is only about one-third of the weight of the known mild steel horseshoe and 
excellent in abrasion-resistance, shock absorption and ductility. It is 
a 5XXX series aluminium alloy, which is non-heat treatable, and does not require 
precipitation hardening with soluting and aging treatments. The features of the present invention are described below. A horseshoe for a race horse should primarily be capable of resisting 
frictions with the track surface, absorbing the momentary shock 
of one ton occurring from the speed of 60 Km/Hr during a race, and re-sisting 
abrasion therefrom. In view of this, the horseshoe according to the 
present invention which is as light as one-third of the conventional 
mild steel shoe, protects the hooves and knee joints of 
the race horse, enhances the racing speed and can be 
securely and
