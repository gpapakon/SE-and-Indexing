<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gable-top container comprising a 
container body, a bottom at a first end of the body, means 

for closing said container at a second end of the body, and 
means for sealing said closing means, said sealing means 

comprising areas of high adhesive force and low adhesive 
force, the areas of low adhesive force comprising two 

surfaces each having raised and lowered parts adjacent to 
and alternate with one another to form a pattern, said 

raised and lowered parts adhering to one another when the 
closing means is sealed characterized in that the lowered 

part of the surface comprises at the center a prefolded 
pouring spout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a gable-top container comprising a 
container body, a bottom at a first end of the body, means 
for closing said container at a second end of the body, and 
means for sealing said closing means, said sealing means 
comprising areas of high adhesive force and low adhesive 
force, the areas of low adhesive force comprising two 
surfaces each having raised and lowered parts adjacent to 
and alternate with one another to form a pattern, said 
raised and lowered parts adhering to one another when the 
closing means is sealed. Such containers as described are known which have a gable-like 
closure on their top. For instance in GB 2,146,624 of 
Tetra Pak International AB is disclosed a container of this 
kind comprising one or more pressure equilizing openings 
placed at the upper part of the container. In EP 286,313 
of Minnesota Mining is disclosed a gable-top sealable 
thermoplastic coated container having stiffening fillets 
secured to gable rib panels or roof rib panels to 
facilitate opening without tearing or delamination. In EP 
185,325 of Tetra Pak International AB is described a 
package made of a supporting material such as cardboard, 
coated with a thermoplastic material, for liquids or the 
like, comprising a tubular main body with a base and a 
cover which is folded into a ridge shape and has a pouring 
spout which can be opened by opening sealed seams, wherein  
 
the sealing region of the spout contains sealing sections 
with strong adhesive power and adjacent sections with low 
adhesive power for peeling the sealing sections apart, and 
wherein the sealing section with low adhesive power is 
formed by a pattern of raised surfaces at a spacing from 
one another, alternating with adjacent sections at a lower 
level, wherein the region with low adhesive power extends 
into the ridge area and into the lateral triangular 
sections of the ridge. Areas with low adhesive power are 
so-called abhesive pads. Containers as described are almost always produced from 
prefabricated blanks which have a suitable arrangement of 
fold lines which facilitate folding up and forming the 
container, by folding into their definitive positions the 
panels or areas which form the upper portion and the 
bottom. The container blanks are mostly coated with a 
thermoplastic material, for example polyethylene, which is 
used both to make the container liquid-tight and also to 
seal the container using heat and pressure so that it is 
correctly folded and sealed in its erected position. The

<CLAIMS>
A gable-top container comprising a container body, a 
bottom at a first end of the body, means for closing 

said container at a second end of the body, and means 
for sealing said closing means, said sealing means 

comprising areas of high adhesive force and low 
adhesive force, the areas of low adhesive force 

comprising two surfaces each having raised and lowered 
parts adjacent to and alternate with one another to 

form a pattern, said raised and lowered parts adhering 
to one another when the closing means is sealed 

characterized in that the lowered part of the surface 
comprises at the center a prefolded pouring spout. 
A gable-top container according to claim 1 
characterized in that the pouring spout is formed by 

six layers, wherein said layers are formed by six 
adjacent areas (1,2,3,4,5,6) extending from the 

container. 
A gable-top container according to claim 2 
characterized in that the pouring spout is a pulling 

device. 
A gable-top container according to claim 3 wherein the 
pulling device upon complete opening forms a larger 

second-shaped pouring spout.
