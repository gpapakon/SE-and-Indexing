<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display which has integrated 
electronics. The liquid crystal display includes a first 

liquid crystal plate (16) member having a bottom surface (22) and a 
plurality of substantially parallel conductors on the bottom 

surface, and a second liquid crystal plate member (18) mounted 
below the first plate member and having a top surface (20) and a 

plurality of substantially parallel conductors on the top 
surface. The conductors of the first plate member (16) are 

substantially perpendicular to the conductors of the second 
plate member (18). A flexible member (14) coupled to the liquid 

crystal display includes a circuit having a driver circuit 
which drives the first and second plate members to form the 

liquid crystal display. The circuit may also include at 
least one integrated circuit, as well as electrical traces 

which are coupled to conductors on the first and second 
plate members. The flexible member (14) mounts on top of the 

first plate member (16) and the exposed portions of the second 
plate member (18), and bends around the first plate member to 

contact the bottom surface (22) of the first plate member at the 
first end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid crystal 
displays, and more specifically to a liquid crystal display 
with integrated electronics. Typically, liquid crystal transparent, normally 
glass, screens for use in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are 
manufactured as individual components, separate from the 
electronic circuits to which they are connected. The 
electronic circuits are generally part of a printed circuit 
board and may include circuitry for driving the liquid 
crystal glass screens, as well as a microprocessor. The 
electronic circuitry may be consolidated into as few 
separate components as possible, with the main processor and 
drive circuitry being located on a single chip. The liquid 
crystal glass screens are connected to the printed circuit 
board to form an LCD device. This known arrangement has the 
disadvantage that connection of the electronic circuits to 
the glass is difficult. A detailed description of the construction of LCDs 
can be found in the text "Electronic Display Devices", by 
Shoichi Matsumoto, published by John Wiley & Sons. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a liquid crystal display in which the above 
mentioned difficulty is alleviated. According to the present invention there is 
provided a liquid crystal display device incorporating a 
first liquid crystal plate member the top surface of which 
includes a plurality of substantially parallel conductors, a 
second liquid crystal plate member, mounted on top of the 
first plate member, the bottom surface of which includes a 
plurality of substantially parallel conductors, wherein the 
conductors of the first plate member are substantially 
perpendicular to the conductors of the second plate member, 
characterized in that a flexible member is coupled to the 
conductors of the first and second plate members, said 
flexible member including a circuit having a driver circuit  
 
which drives the first and second plate members to form a 
liquid crystal display. A liquid crystal display device in accordance with 
the invention may additionally include at least one 
integrated circuit, which may include a microprocessor. The 
flexible member mounts on top of the second plate and the 
exposed portions of the first plate, and bends around the 
first plate to contact the bottom surface of the second 
plate at the first end. An embodiment of the present invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:-
