Method for updating a system program stored in
read-only memories (ROM) in a program-controlled

switching facility (VE), with

an operation and maintenance-oriented system program
part for carrying out operational instructions, in

particular access instructions specifying address and
data and relating to a read/write memory area (RAM) in

the switching facility (VE), for the purpose of whose
input a data processing device (BT) can be connected as

an operational terminal, and with
a read program module for the demand-controlled
reading-in of series of information units transmitted

to the switching facility (VE) which represent
instructions, the data processing device (BT) first

transmitting instructions for storing an updated system
program, stored in said data processing device, in the

read/write memory area (RAM) of the switching facility
(VE), and
an instruction for storing a program start address for
the updated system program then being transmitted to

the memory location (Task x+1) used to store the return
address which is to be addressed by the processor

device (UP) in the switching facility (VE) when the
read program module has ended.
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized
 

in that
, when the instruction for storing the program
start address has been transmitted, a f
urther
information unit to be read in by the read program

module is transmitted from the data processing device
(BT) to the switching facility (VE) in order to prompt

the read program module to return to the start address
of the updated system program when the information unit

has been read in.
