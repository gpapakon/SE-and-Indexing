<ABSTRACT>
A golf putter includes a clubhead and a shaft. The 
clubhead is symmetrical about a first plane which extends 

through the center of the clubhead perpendicularly to the face 
of the clubhead. The centerline of the shaft passes through the 

intersection between the first plane and a second plane which is 
perpendicular to the first plane and which extends through the 

point on the face which is intended to contact a golf ball.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf putters, and, more 
particularly, to a putter which resists twisting upon impact 
with a golf ball. The function of a putter is to strike a golf ball so 
that the ball rolls into the hole. It is therefore important 
that the putter strike the ball so that the ball travels along 
the intended line of travel. In most putters the shaft is attached to the head of 
the putter at or near the heel end of the head. The center of 
percussion or sweetspot of the head is at or near the center of 
the head. If the ball is not struck by the sweetspot of the 
head, the head tends to twist at impact which will cause the 
ball to roll off line. In some putters the shaft is attached to the head at or 
near the midplane of the head, i.e., the plane which extends 
through the center of the head perpendicularly to the face of 
the head. However, such putters still have a tendency to tiwst 
at impact if the ball is not struck by the sweetspot. The invention provides a putter having a balanced or 
symmetrical head and a shaft which intersects the plane of 
symmetry where that plane intersects a second plane which is 
perpendicular to the plane of symmetry and which passes through 
the point of the face which is intended to contact a golf ball. 
The clubhead is thereby provided with increased resistance to 
twisting upon impact with a golf ball, particularly when the 
ball is not impacted at the plane of symmetry.  The drawing will be explained in conjunction with 
illustrative embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, in 
which --

taken along the line 1A-1A of Figure 1; Figure 2 is a rear elevational view, partially broken 
away, of the putter; Figure 3 is a toe end view partially broken away, of

embodiment of a putter head; Figure 7 is a rear elevational view of the putter head

embodiment of a putter head; Figure 9 is a rear elevational view of the putter head 
of Figure 8; Figure 10 is a view similar to Figure 4 of yet another 
embodiment of a putter head; and Figure 11 is a rear elevational view of the putter head

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A golf putter comprising a clubhead and a shaft 
attached to the clubhead, the clubhead having a flat face for 

striking a golf ball, a sole, a toe portion, a heel portion, a 
central portion between the toe and heel portions, the weight of 

the clubhead being distributed substantially symmetrically on 
both sides of a first plane which extends through the center of 

the clubhead perpendicularly to the face, the shaft having a 
centerline which passes through the intersection between said 

first plane and a second plane which is perpendicular to said 
first plane and which extends through the point on the face 

which is intended to contact the golf ball. 
The putter of claim 1 in which said second plane is 
spaced from about 0.50 to about 0.84 inch above the point of the 

sole which is intersected by said first plane. 
The putter of claim 1 in which the shaft includes a 
bottom end which is attached to the clubhead and a top end, the 

centerline of the shaft between the bottom and top ends lying in 
a plane which passes through said intersection between said 

first and second planes. 
The putter of claim 1 in which the clubhead 
includes a face portion which includes said face and a flange 

portion which extends rearwardly from the face portion and which 
includes said sole, the toe portion including 
a toe weight which 
extends upwardly from the flange, the heel portion including a 

heel weight which extends upwardly from the sole, the shaft 
being attached to the flange portion. 
The putter of claim 4 in which the flange portion 
includes an upwardly extending lug portion in the central 

portion of the clubhead, the lug portion having a bore in which 
the shaft is inserted. 
The putter of claim 1 in which the clubhead is 
integrally formed of homogeneous material. 
The putter of claim 1 in which the portions of the 
clubhead on opposite sides of said first plane are mirror 

images. 
The putter of claim 1 in which the portion of the 
sole which is intersected by said first plane is tangent to a 

ground plane which is parallel to said second plane.
