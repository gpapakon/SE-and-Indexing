<ABSTRACT>
A method for adsorption of a substance from a liquid sample on a fluidized bead or stirred suspension, in which the beads used comprise a base matrix and exhibit a structure having affinity to the substance, characterized in that the structure is covalently bound to the base matrix via an extender. Populations of beads in which the beads contain a filler incorporated in a base matrix and an extender are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the separation of a
substance by adsorption to non-packed beds containing beads
which exhibit structures (ligands) with affinity to the
substance. Non-packed beds may be generated by expanding/fluidizing
sedimented beads by an upward or a downward flow of
fluid, the direction of flow being depending on the density of
the beads used. A liquid sample containing the substance to be
adsorbed is introduced into the flow after expansion. A less
effective non-packed bed is generated by agitating suspendible
beads with the aid of a turbulent flow or by mechanical
stirring.By selecting a bead population which includes beads varying
in sizes and/or densities and using this population in an
expanded bed, it is possible to obtain a so-called classified
bed in which larger beads and beads with higher densities are
located below smaller beads and beads with lower densities. The
backmixing in these type of beds becomes low and they have been
named stable expanded beds (sometimes stable fluidized beds).
An alternative way of stabilizing a fluidized bed is by
incorporating magnetic filler particles into the beads and
apply a magnetic field during the fluidization. Stabilization
by a magnetic field is an example that stable expanded beds can
be achieved without using beads covering a certain size/density
range. The adsorption in stable fluidized beds will take place
during plug flow as in a chromatographic process in a packed
bed. The number of theoretical plates will be high. In case the
non-packed bed is generated by a turbulent flow or by
agitation, backmixing will be high and the adsorption will take
place in a batch-wise mode. For a short, recent survey of the
field, see the introductory part of Thömmes et al., Biotechnol.
Bioengin. 48 (1995) 367-374.Back-mixing in a bed is often measured as axial dispersion
("vessel dispersion number"), see Levenspiel, "Chemical
Reaction Engineering" 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons (1972). 
For stable expanded beds, the vessel dispersion number will
preferably be < 75x10-3, more preferably < 20x10-3, which
corresponds > 5, more preferably > 30 theoretical plates. For
total back-mixing, the number of plates will be 1.Expansion/fluidization of the bed is normally effected in a
column having provided at each of its ends a net structure
covering the cross-sectional area of the column, or some other
perforated device which will not generate turbulence in the
flow. See, for instance, WO-A-9218237 (Pharmacia Biotech AB,
Uppsala, Sweden). The similar
