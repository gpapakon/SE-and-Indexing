<ABSTRACT>
Process for extracting the residue resulting from the distillation of polluted industrial waste water and solvents by means of mechanical vapour compression, in which the point in time of the extraction is determined by using process parameters. The process is characterised by the fact that after the condensation and cooling of the vapours, the temp. of the distillate is continuously measured and on exceeding a predetermined maximum value, the extraction of the residue is carried out. Also claimed is an apparatus for carrying out the above process. Appts. comprises an evaporator (1), to which polluted goods (3) are fed via a recuperator (9) and residue (6) is withdrawn via a drain valve (5). In the evaporator there is a tubular heat exchanger (7), that is connected via pipe (16) with the mechanical compressor (15) and via a further pipe (8) with the recuperator. The vapour produced in the evaporator (1) is sucked via a vapour dome (12) and a pipe (13) from the compressor (15). The appts. is characterised by the fact that a temp. measuring device (18) is situated in the region of the recuperators (9) in pipe (22) for the extraction of the distillate. The device (18) is connected to an optical or acoustic display device.

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling the extraction of the 
residue in the distillation of polluted industrial 

effluent and solvents by means of mechanical vapour 
compression, in which the time of extraction is 

determined by detecting a process parameter,
 
characterised in that
 
after the condensation and cooling of the vapours the 

temperature of the distillate is measured constantly 
and if a set maximum value is exceeded the extraction 

of the residue is triggered. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the maximum value is derived from empirical 

values. 
An apparatus for performing the method according 
to Claim 1, comprising an evaporator (1), to which 

polluted product (3) is supplied via a preceding 
recuperator (9) and from which residue (6) is removed 

via a discharge valve (5) and in which a tube bundle 
(7) is arranged as a heat exchanger, which bundle is 

connected via a line (16) to the mechanical vapour 
compressor (15) and via an additional line (8) to the 

recuperator (9) and the vapours produced in the 
evaporator (1) are drawn in from the compressor (15) 

via a still head (12) and a line (13), with a 
temperature measurement apparatus (18) being arranged 

in the region of the line (22) leaving the recuperator 
(9) for removing the distillate (10), which measurement 

apparatus is connected to a visual or acoustic display 
unit, characterised in that the temperature measurement 

apparatus (18) is connected via a control line (19) to 
the discharge valve (5) for the residue (6).
