<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a traction 
sheave elevator with drive machine below, 

comprising an elevator car (1) moving 
along elevator guide rails (10), a counterweight 

moving along counterweight 
guide rails (11), a set of hoisting ropes 

(3) supporting the elevator car and the 
counterweight, and in the bottom part of 

the elevator shaft a drive machine unit 
(6) comprising a traction sheave (7) 

driven by the drive machine and engaging 
the hoisting ropes (3). The drive machine 

unit (6) of the elevator is placed below 
the path of the counterweight (2). In the 

direction of the thickness of the counterweight, 
the drive machine unit (6) is 

placed substantially inside the shaft 
space extension required by the counterweight 

(2) on its path, including the 
safety distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traction sheave elevator 
as defined in the preamble of claim 1. One of the objectives aimed at in the development of elevators 
has been an efficient and economic use of building 
space. In conventional traction-sheave driven elevators, the 
elevator machine room or other space reserved for the drive 
machinery takes up a considerable portion of the building 
space required by the elevator. The problem is not only the 
volume of the building space needed for the elevator, but 
also its location in the building. There are numerous solutions 
to the placement of the machine room, but they generally 
significantly restrict the design of the building at 
least in respect of space utilization or appearance. E.g. 
for an elevator with the machine placed beside the bottom 
part of the shaft, the building has to be provided with a 
machine room or space placed beside the shaft, generally on 
the lowest floor served by the elevator. Being a special 
space, the machine room generally involves increased 
building costs. With respect to utilization of space, hydraulic elevators 
are relatively advantageous, and they often allow the entire 
drive machine to be placed in the elevator shaft. Hydraulic 
elevators are applicable in cases where the lifting height 
is one floor or at most a few floors. In practice, hydraulic 
elevators cannot be constructed for very large heights. To meet the need to achieve a reliable elevator which is 
advantageous in respect of economy and utilization of space 
and for which the space requirement in the building, irrespective 
of the hoisting height, is substantially limited to 
the space required by the elevator car and counterweight on 
their paths including the safety distances and the space 
needed for the hoisting ropes, and in which the above-mentioned 
drawbacks can be avoided, a new type of traction  
 
sheave elevator is presented as an invention. The traction 
sheave elevator of the invention is characterized by what is 
presented in the characterization part of claim 1. Other 
embodiments of the invention are characterized by the 
features presented in the other claims. The advantages which can be achieved by applying the present 
invention include the following: 
The traction sheave elevator of the invention allows an 
obvious space saving to be achieved in the building because 
no separate machine room is needed. Efficient utilization of the cross-sectional area of the 
elevator shaft. Advantages in installation because the system has
