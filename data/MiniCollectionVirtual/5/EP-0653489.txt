<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to novel Eimeria proteins 
with immunogenic propert
ies as well as to DNA 
sequences encoding these proteins. These proteins can 

be administered to poultry thereby protecting the 
birds against coccidiosis. In addition the DNA 

encoding these proteins can be used for the 
preparation of a vector vaccine against coccidiosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protein
derived from an Eimeria species, in particular Eimeria
maxima, which is capable of stimulating immune
lymphocytes. It also relates to a nucleic acid
sequence encoding all or an antigenically significant
part of this protein, a recombinant vector comprising
such a nucleic acid sequence, a host cell or organism
transformed with such a recombinant vector and a
vaccine for the protection of poultry against
coccidiosis.Coccidiosis is a disease caused by infection with
one or more of the many species of coccidia,
intracellular protozoal parasites of the subphylum
Apicomplexa and the genus Eimeria. Poultry is defined
herein as domesticated birds that serve as a source of
eggs or meat and that include such commercially
important kinds as chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese,
guinea fowl, pheasants, pigeons and peafowl.Coccidiosis in chickens is known to be caused by
several different species of Eimeria, namely Eimeria
acervulina, E. maxima, E. tenella, E. necatrix,
E. brunetti, E. mitis, E. praecox, E. mivati and
E. hagani. Some people, however, doubt the true
existence of the last two species. Low level infection
with any of these Eimeria species results in a
protective immunity to reinfection.The species do differ in their pathogenic effect
on chickens, the type of chicken also playing a role;
thus, a broiler chicken will be subjected to a great
deal of damage by a parasite such as E. acervulina or 
E. maxima because these parasitise large portions of
the small intestine, where food digestion plays a
major role.E. maxima is the most immunogenic of the species
listed above, producing good natural protection
following infection. There are, however, strain
variations with little or no cross protection between
strains.During the life cycle, the Eimeria parasite
passes through a number of stages. The life cycle
begins when the chicken ingests the infectious stage,
known as the sporulating oocyst, during ground feeding
or by inhalation of dust. In the case of E. maxima,
the oocyst is unusually large. The wall of the
sporulated oocyst is ruptured by a combination of
mechanical grinding action and chemical action in the
gizzard and intestinal tract, resulting in the release
of four sporocysts. The sporocysts pass into the
duodenum where they are exposed to bile and digestive
enzymes resulting in the release of an average of ten
sporozoites per sporocyst.The sporozoites are mobile and search for
suitable host epithelium cells in order to penetrate
and reproduce in them. Following
