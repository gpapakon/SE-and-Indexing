<ABSTRACT>
The reactor pressure vessel has a nozzle (2) connected to a feed water supply line (3), a coaxial protection sleeve (5) (thermal sleeve), which expands in the case of temperature changes, being arranged in the said nozzle (2). The protection sleeve (5) bears in a sliding fashion with its outer end on the nozzle (2) and is connected at its inner end to a feed water distribution ring located in the vessel. Between the outer end of the nozzle (2) and the feed water supply line (3), there is installed a pipe section (10) in which a folding bellows (15) is arranged. The folding bellows (15) is connected in a sealing fashion at its one end to the outer end of the protection sleeve (5) and at its other end to the pipe section (10).

<CLAIMS>
A reactor pressure vessel of a nuclear power station, 
having at least one pipe socket connected to a feed-water 

supply line, in which a coaxial protective sleeve 
expanding with changes in temperature is 

disposed, which with its outer end slidably abuts the 
pipe socket and with its inner end is connected to a 

feed-water distributing ring situated in the vessel,
characterised in that
 a pipe section is inserted between 
the outer end of the pipe socket and the feed-water 

supply line,
and in that
 in the pipe section are disposed bellows, 
which with one end are tightly connected to the outer end 

of the expanding protective sleeve and with their other 
end are tightly connected to the pipe section. 
A vessel according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 in the bellows is disposed a pipe, 
which at one end outside the bellows is connected to the 

pipe section and the other end of which extends into the 
outer end of the expanding protective sleeve. 
A vessel according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the pipe section is extended 
opposite the pipe socket and at both its ends is provided 

with hollow conical parts, the tapered ends of which are 
adapted to the dimensions of the feed-water supply line 

and the end of the pipe socket respectively.
