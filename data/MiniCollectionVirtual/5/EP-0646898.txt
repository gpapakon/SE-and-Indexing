<ABSTRACT>
In a system to effect transactions with a multi-functional card with an integrated circuit, the circuit includes a bank application, assigned to the user's account-keeping bank, and at least one exchange application, assigned to a supplier of services or manufacturer. With the aid of a device communicating with the card, the card-user can load a selectable amount of money into the exchange application. The exchange supplier is provided with an authentic certificate of the amount loaded into the exchange and credited to the account of the exchange supplier, without the secret data necessary for issuing the certificate having to be stored in the exchange application or in the exchange terminal.

A method for conducting money transactions on a multifunctional card having an
integrated circuit which contains a bank application associated with a user's account-keeping

bank and at least one purse application associated with a service
provider or dealer; with the aid of an apparatus for loading a selectable sum of

money into the purse application in that transaction data containing the sum of
money are transmitted from the apparatus to the card and transferred from the

bank application to the purse application within the integrated circuit of the card,
whereby


a transaction certificate is prepared within the bank application from the transaction
data transmitted from the apparatus, using secret data known only to the bank

or stored in the bank application,
the transaction certificate is transmitted to the purse application,
the purse application authenticates the transaction certificate,
the authenticated transaction certificate is transmitted to the apparatus, and
the sum of money to be transferred is loaded into the purse application only when
the apparatus confirms to the purse application the reception of the transaction

certificate authenticated by the purse application.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the transaction certificate transmitted
from the purse application to the apparatus and the latter's confirmation of reception

of the transaction certificate are authenticated by secret data known only to
the service provider or dealer and stored in the purse application and in the apparatus
The method of claim 2, characterized in that an authenticating code is calculated
for authenticating the transaction certificate in the purse application with the aid of

a first purse code, the authenticating code is transmitted together with the transaction
certificate to the apparatus and the authenticating code is verified in the apparatus

with the aid of the first purse code. 
The method of claim 3, characterized in that a second authenticating code is calculated
from the transaction certificate with the aid of a second purse code in the

apparatus, and said authenticating code is transmitted to the purse application and
verified in the purse application.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that before the transaction data are transmitted
from the apparatus to the purse application an authenticating code is

formed in the apparatus, transmitted together with the transaction data to the purse
application and verified in the latter.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that before the transaction certificate is
formed the bank application checks whether the sum of money to be transferred is

within a disposal limit defined in the bank application.
The method of claim 1 or 6, characterized in that before the transaction certificate
is formed the bank application ascertains whether the number of transfers performed

with the card exceeds an adjustable value.
An apparatus for carrying out the method of claim 1, having

a multifunctional card (MF1) with an integrated circuit containing a bank application
(2) associated with a user's account-keeping bank and at least one purse application

(3) associated with a service provider, and
an apparatus (5) for loading a selectable sum of money into the purse application
(3), a bidirectional data connection existing between apparatus (5) and purse application

(3) and between purse application (3) and bank application (2), whereby
at least one code (S1
Purse
) for authenticating data (ZF
Bank
) obtained from the bank
application (2) is stored in the purse application (3), and the same code (S1
Purse
) is
stored for confirming an authcntication in the apparatus (5).
