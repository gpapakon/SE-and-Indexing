A process for transport, or loading or unloading of a powder catalyst or
adsorbent, by means of an enclosure (intended to contain said powder

catalyst or adsorbent), said enclosure being able to pivot arount its
horizontal axis for loading and unloading operations of the catalyst, the

process being characterized in that said enclosure pivots by controlled
rocking by means of a reverse-lock ratchet similar to an escape wheel.
A process according to claim 1 applied to the transport of to the loading
and unloading of pyrophoric catalysts.
The process according to claim 1 or 2 applied to the transport or to the
loading and unloading of catalysts having a self-heating characteristic.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, wherein said enclosure
has a base of a metal preferably stainless steel.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein said enclosure is
equipped with a single filling opening equipped with a fluid-tight valve.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein said enclosure
can be brought under the pressure of a gas and is equipped with a

pressure control system.
A process according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, wherein said enclosure is
set in a stable support, said support being provided with feet or being

able to be displaced along a rail, a channel or any other equivalent means.
