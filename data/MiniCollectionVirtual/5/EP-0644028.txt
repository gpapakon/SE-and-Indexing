<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a molded article with a pattern formed on the
front surface of the article and sealed with a resin layer,
i.e., a molded article formed of a thermoplastic resin in the
form of a film or a sheet and provided with a pattern which is
formed on its front surface and is sealed with a resin layer
(to be sometimes simply referred to as "molded article with a
sealed pattern" hereinafter), by an injection compression
molding method. The term "pattern" also includes characters,
letters, marks, symbols, and the like.Various methods for producing a molded article with a
sealed pattern are known, as disclosed for example in JP-A-61-120741,
on which the two-part form of claims 1 and 3 is based.
JP-A-61-120741 discloses a method in which a thermoplastic film
or sheet (to be sometimes referred to as a "film substrate"
hereinafter) having a pattern on its front surface is placed in
the cavity of a mold with its reverse surface in contact with
the cavity wall and a molten thermoplastic resin is injected
into the gap surrounded by the cavity wall and the front
surface of the film substrate to form a resin layer on the
front surface of the film substrate. When the molten
thermoplastic resin is injected, the pattern formed on the film
substrate surface near the gate portion of the mold is
sometimes damaged under the influence of shear stress of the
molten thermoplastic resin. For preventing the damage to the
pattern, the above method requires the pattern formed on the
surface to be spaced at least 1 cm from the gate portion of the
mold. Therefore, the above method has a problem in that the
design of the molded article or the design of the mold is
limited. The damage to the pattern is specifically recognized,
for example, as the following phenomenon. 
The pattern is deformed or lost due to displacement of a
printing ink forming the pattern on the surface of the
film substrate.JP-A-1-95019 discloses one method as a
solution for the problem of the method of the above
JP-A-61-120741. In the method disclosed in
JP-A-1-95019, a film or sheet of a transparent resin (to
be sometimes simply referred to as a "film of a
transparent resin") is laminated on that surface of a
film or sheet substrate (to be sometimes referred to as
a "sheet substrate" hereinafter) on which a pattern is
formed, or a transparent resin is coated on the above
surface of the sheet substrate, and then a thermoplastic
resin is injected to form a resin layer on the film of a
transparent resin or on
