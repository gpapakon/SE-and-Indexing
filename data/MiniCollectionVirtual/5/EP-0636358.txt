<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new compositions based on hydrogen peroxide, which can be used especially as, or for the manufacture of, fixers for permanent wavings, the said compositions being characterised by the fact that they comprise at least one carboxylic acid and/or one of its associated salts, for example citric acid, as well as at least one basifying amine-containing compound, for example ammonium hydroxide. It also relates to the use of the said compositions in processes for the permanent deformation of keratinic substances, in particular hair. The compositions according to the invention make it possible to overcome the disadvantages linked in particular to the repeated application, to the hair, of permanent waving operations, especially carbonated (softness, sensitivity to dyeing and the like).

Treatment process for the permanent-reshaping 
and/or -shape-stabilizing of keratinous materials, of the 

type consisting, in a first step, in reducing the
