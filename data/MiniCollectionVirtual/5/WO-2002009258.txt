<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rolling bearing arrangement for an electromotor consisting essentially of a rotationally symmetrical rotor (2) which is rotationally mounted inside a stator (1). At least one standard rolling bearing (3) is provided for rotationally mounting the rotor (2), this rolling bearing having an outer ring (5) which is located in a bearing seat (4), in a fixed position in relation to the stator. Said outer ring interacts with an inner ring (8) which is located on a shaft (7) of the rotor through a rolling body arrangement (6). The bearing seat is lined with an insulation arrangement in order to prevent current conduction between the stator and the rotor. The bearing seat (4) of the outer ring (5) is actually lined with the insulation arrangement (9, 10a, 10b), this insulation arrangement having a thin, sheet-type semifinished product comprising insulating material that is resistant to the radial pressure of the bearing.
