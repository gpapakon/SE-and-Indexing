 ADHESIN-O IGOSACCHARIDE CONJUGATE VACCINE FOR HAEMOPHIUJS INFHJENZAEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Serial No.07/ 903,079, filed June 22, 1992, which is a continuation-in- part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/810,966, filed December 20, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/ 631,698, filed December 21, 1990, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.This invention relates generally to vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae. In particular, it relates to a conjugate vaccine in which a synthetic oligosaccharide corresponding to a fragment of the polysaccharide capsule of H. influenzae type b has been coupled to an H. influenzae adhesin protein. The vaccine may be used against both invasive and non-invasive H. influenzae infec¬ tion of humans, particularly very young infants, and other mammals.H. influenzae (Hi) are divided into two groups, those strains that possess a polysaccharide capsule and those that do not. The encapsulated strains are typed by a serological reaction of a capsule with reference antisera. Types a-f have been identified. The non-encapsulated strains, which fail to react with any of the reference antisera, are known as non-typeable. 

 Hi are a significant health problem worldwide. The type b strain (Hib) is the most virulent of the Hi strains, causing meningitis, acute epiglottitis, and other life- threatening infections in children five years old and younger. The mortality rate from type b meningitis is about 5%, even with the best modern antibiotic treatments, and neurological sequelae are observed in as many as 25-35% of the survivors. In fact, bacterial meningitis caused by type b strains has been identified as the leading cause of acquired mental retardation in the United States. Thus, World Health Organization has made the development of an effective vaccine against Hib a priority.Non-typeable Hi also cause various diseases, including pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, postpartum sepsis, bronchitis, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, and otitis media. The non-typeable Hi cause about 20-40% of all otitis media in children and young adults. Current therapy for chronic or repeated occurrences of otitis media generally involves antibiotic administration. Children may experience multiple infections because infection does not confer a lasting immunity.A great deal of time, money, and effort has been spent trying to find a truly
