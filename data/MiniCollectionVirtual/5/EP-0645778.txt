<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a phosphor comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing a substrate for deposition and growth of an alkali 
halide phosphor, 
(b) forming a patterned surface on the substrate comprising a 
plurality of ridges, each of the ridges having an angular inclined 

slope, an angular declined slope, the inclined and declined 
slopes meeting at one common region or point to form a 

structure having a triangular cross-sectional shape, each ridge 
being separated from one another by horizontal segments of the 

substrate and wherein: 

(i) the ratio of the height of each ridge to the width of each 
horizontal segment of the substrate separating the ridges 

is in the range of about 1:100 to 1:5; 
(ii) the ratio of the width of each ridge to the width of each 
horizontal segment of the substrate separating the ridges 

is in the range of about 1:50 to 1:5; and 
(c) depositing an alkali halide phosphor on the patterned surface of 
the substrate of step (b), thereby forming cracks, in the 

deposited phosphor, which originate or emanate from the 

angular inclined and/or declined slopes of each ridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming a phosphor and in 
particular, it relates to a process for forming a phosphor on a substrate having 
a predetermined configuration. One of the essential components of a radiation imaging device is a 
radiation input converter. In most applications of position-sensitive radiation 
detection, conventional radiography, and digital radiography, a phosphor 
screen is used to convert the incoming radiation into visible light which is then 
detected on film, on a photodiode, or other position sensing device. Such 
phosphor screens are usually required to have high resolution and high output 
brightness characteristics. The brightness of the light output is, in part, a 
function of the thickness of the phosphor layer, which determines the amount 
or X-ray energy absorbed, and of the inherent phosphor efficiency in 
converting X-ray radiation into detectable light. However, as this layer is 
made thicker, the spatial resolution is decreased because light photons emitted 
in response to the absorption of X-ray photons or charged particles will scatter 
within the phosphor layer and emerge from the phosphor surface at points 
further away in the transverse direction. Such lateral light spreading is caused 
by two factors. First, the phosphor emits light photons isotropically from the 
point at which a radiation particle, such as the X-ray photon, is absorbed. 
Second, even light photons which are traveling more or less perpendicularly to 
the surface of the phosphor layer may be scattered in the lateral direction 
before they reach the surface. Thus, the actual thickness of the phosphor 
layer is a compromise between the desired high radiation absorption that may 
be obtained from thicker layers and the required or desired resolution which 
improves as the thickness of the layer is reduced. Clearly, it would be  
 
desirable to increase the thickness of the phosphor layer without degrading the 
spatial resolution. This can be accomplished by suppressing the lateral light 
spread within the layer through the formation of small cracks perpendicular to 
the phosphor surface. The incorporation of cracks in the phosphor layer, which are 
essentially perpendicular to the surface of the phosphor layer, provides 
enhancement of the resolution of light emitted from the phosphor in response 
to incident X-rays. A phosphor "cell" is formed when a continuous coating of 
phosphor is surrounded by a boundary of cracks. An emitted photon from the 
interaction of the phosphor with
