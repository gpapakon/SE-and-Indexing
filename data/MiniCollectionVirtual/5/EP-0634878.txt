<ABSTRACT>
In the alternate routing in a communication network (NI) for switched connections, the path sections for setting up a connection are tested step by step for their seizability from exchange (Vst A,... Vst E, Vst G, Vst H) to exchange (Vst B,... Vst F, Vst G, Vst H). Blocking (BL1) of a path section and lacking or failed overflow mandatorily cause the desired connection to be released to the originating exchange (Vst A). According to the invention, the alternate routing can be used again step by step in rear transit exchanges (Vst C) involved in the setting up of the connection when the blocked connection is released in the reverse direction.

A process for routing traffic in a communications
network (NI) for circuit-switched connections in which the

establishment of a connection between an originating
exchange (Vst A) and a destination exchange (Vst F) takes

place in accordance with the alternative routing method in
stepped fashion from the originating exchange (Vst A) to

the destination exchange (Vst F) via a plurality of transit
exchanges (Vst B,..., Vst E, Vst G, Vst H) and in which, in

the event that the connection is released in the backward
direction during the connection establishment, the

alternative routing can be re-implemented in stepped
fashion in at least one of the transit exchanges (Vst C)

already participating in the connection establishment,
characterised in that


- during the connection establishment all the received
and transmitted digits and information data required

for the connection establishment, which are contained
in first items of signalling information (IAM, SAM)

and which indicate at least the destination exchange
(Vst F), are intermediately stored in the transit

exchanges (Vst B, .., Vst E, Vst G, Vst H)
participating in the connection establishment,
- that during the connection establishment at least one
alternative route can be determined in the transit

exchanges (Vst B, ..., Vst E, Vst G, Vst H)
participating in the connection establishment,
- that upon the release of the connection during the
connection establishment the releasing transit

exchange (Vst E) generates a second item of signalling
information (UBM) identifying the release and

indicating a release reason (CAUSE), and this second
item of signalling information (UBM) is transmitted

backwards in stepped fashion from transit exchange
(Vst D, Vst E) to transit exchange (Vst C, Vst D), 
- that during the connection establishment the transit
exchanges (Vst B, Vst C, Vst D, Vst E) are not

switched through transparently with respect to the
signalling and therefore can evaluate the signalling

information identifying the release and
- that the transit exchange (Vst C) which is the first
to be able to make the alternative route available

upon the release of the connection in the backward
direction re-implements the alternative routing and

partially releases the connection in the direction of
the congestion.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the number of re-implementations of the alternative routing

in transit exchanges already participating in the
connection establishment in the event of a release of the

connection in the backward direction during the connection
establishment is limited.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the re-implementation of the alternative routing in at

least one of the transit exchanges already participating in
the connection establishment in the event of a release of

the connection in the backward direction during the
connection establishment is permitted or prohibited.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
it is used in a communications network for circuit-switched

connections which is not fully meshed.
