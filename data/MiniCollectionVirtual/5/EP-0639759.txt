<ABSTRACT>
The one-piece flat vibratory measuring element (1) has two fastening tongues (3), between which, connected by means of coupling elements (9), the vibrating string (15) is constructed. In the connection region of the vibrating string (15) to the coupling elements (9), node regions (19) are constructed, which consist of elastic tongues (13) running in pairs parallel to the vibrating string (15), the roots of the said tongues and the attachment points of the vibrating string (15) lying on a straight line. The mass per unit length of the elastic tongues (13) is significantly larger than that of the measuring string (15). If the measuring string (15) oscillates in the direction (A) of the small bending stiffness, the elastic tongues (13), arranged in pairs, also oscillate at the same frequency, but in opposite phase. These opposite-phase oscillations effect an extensive suppression of oscillations in the node region (19) and in the coupling elements (9) lying behind it. By means of this decoupling of the oscillations of the vibrating string (15), a very low loss of oscillation energy occurs. The vibratory measuring instrument (1) according to the invention is preferably produced from the finest sheet metal and can be used irrespective of position, thanks to its low mass.
